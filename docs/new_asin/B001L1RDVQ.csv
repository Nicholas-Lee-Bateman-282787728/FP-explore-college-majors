3676635,5,B001L1RDVQ,"Hilarious movie! Kids laugh, adults laugh, everyone laughs! If you enjoyed Madagascar then you will love this movie even more. Having the blu-ray/DVD combo has worked out great and allows us to leave the DVD in the car.",1331596800,,219,4.7894736842105265
3676636,5,B001L1RDVQ,My children and I LOVED the first one and this one was a perfect follow up. We have watched this so much that my 6 year old can voice the whole script if we allowed him to...lol  Definitely worth adding to your collection and the blue-ray makes these characters come to life!,1317859200,,275,4.288461538461538
3676637,5,B001L1RDVQ,"What a great movie!  Usually the sequels aren't as good as the original but this sequal surpasses the first Madagascar.  Tons of humor for kids and adults alike, and Will-I-Am does a fantastic job on the soundtrack!!",1314748800,,216,4.8108108108108105
3676638,5,B001L1RDVQ,"Surprisingly Madagascar Escape2Africa is as enjoyable as the first film, which these days of shoddy sequels of a feat unto itself.  The Bluray transfer is excellent. Picture 5/5 Sound 4/5 (Because it is 5.1)  My wife and kids loved the first film and were just as entertained by this one.  Also the decision to include DVDs and not digital copies was a wise choice.  Every other digital copy I try to download into iTunes fails because they are expired.  Why oh why do the studios do this.  Digital copies are splashed over the covers of DVDs and now Bluray.  So kudos to Dreamworks for including proper DVDs.  For those of us that have children and travel, at least me, love having a DVD to play in the minivan and my portable DVD player.",1298764800,9,739,4.503759398496241
3676639,1,B001L1RDVQ,"Purchased this DVD for my Grandson for his Birthday was very disappointed it would not play on their TV or
DVD player.  My Daughter had to go out and buy a new one.  When she did we even noticed the actual DVD that
would not work looked completely different from the new one she purchased.  There were no pictures of the
Madagascar characters just bank looking.  I will not order DVDs again after this.",1298678400,,402,4.391891891891892

3676665,4,B001L1RDVQ,"Madagascar 2 was delightfully refreshing and adorable. Rented it for a sleepover my granddaughter was coming to our house to have, and she wanted to watch movies and have popcorn. I chose the movie because she hadn't seen it. It started out with a bang, and went full speed form there! Characters were adorable and quirky, and the pace never dragged. By the time I got in bed to watch the movie with my granddaughter, she was asleep! lol But that was ok, I watched it! lol I haven't watched an animated movie in over 15 years, but LOVED this one! A few adult humor jokes thrown in for the grown ups, but found one awkward and a bit innappropriate, but the rest were fine. It was uplifting, had a clear moral, and the penguins and lemurs were hysterical! A very fast paced family movie that I would watch again and again.

It tells the story of how Alex ended up at the zoo and introduces us to his family.
I also loved the scenes with Moto Moto and although the kids didn't get the meaning of what was being said, I loved it.

3676706,3,B001L1RDVQ,"Sascha Baron Cohen's King is again the hands-down favorite, I heard a ripple of joy murmur through the theater at everything he said and did, although my personal favorites (after the Penguins) are Maurice and Mort, the King's cohorts.

BF was also teasing me mercilessly because (and I'm nearly ashamed to admit it) there's one scene that had me totally teared up! Yes, I cried. Can't spoil it - go see the movie and tell me after if you know what choked me up! The film did not hold the attention of some of the very small children at the screening we saw, because some portions of the film only involve adult storyline concerning the adult star characters (Alec Baldwin, Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Rock, and so forth) but when the little characters are on screen (the baby lion in particular is DARLING) the children present were absolutely captivated.

It's fun. It's not the greatest movie of all time, but it's very fun and children will want to watch it again and again.",1449878400,,976,4.635838150289017

Now, as soon as I'm released from sleeping on the camping cot in the garage, I can fish the movie out of the trash and really get down to memorizing those Moto Moto lines.

The late, great Bernie Mack lends his voice to a lion which is cool. Also, making an appearance (vocal occurrence?) is Alec Baldwin, who's animated avatar is a perfectly coiffed lion with a dark side (kind of a Scar from the Lion King kind of role).
The New Yorker lady was good for a chuckle in the first movie, but giving her a bigger role in this movie was a mistake.
If it were up to me, I'd skip over this one and go straight to the 3rd movie which is much better.",1384992000,,506,4.01980198019802

As with most sequels,  it is not as good as the 1st or 3rd movies of this series.  As with most sequels, the producers realize that they made a hit with the 1st movie and so try and do another one.  This is good, not great, yet good.  It is worth the asking price to buy it.  Which we have.  It is up beat and not very political in nature as with many of the kids movies now a days.  So my children can enjoy a good wholesome animated movie with out much hidden agendas.

The running gag with the older lady is the only real drag to the movie in my opinion, that seems unnecessary yet is unfortunately important to the plot.  The humor is great and even the little things, like the theme of ""Born Free"" playing when they the great herds on the African plains for the first time, are all terrific touches.

3676840,2,B001L1RDVQ,"When you ""purchase"" a video from Amazon, please be aware that you do not own it.  You have a license to use the video for an ""indefinite"" viewing period.  In our case, it was about two weeks for Madagascar 2.  Our son watched this movie all the way through only once, and when he asked to watch ""lions dancing movie"" again, we could no longer watch it.

This is obviously very misleading.  People think purchasing intellectual property means that they own it.

It is clear from other comments that others had the same experience.

Amazon needs to discontinue the ""purchase"" option from Amazon Instant Video if ""purchase"" does not have its common meaning.

UPDATE: Amazon did refund the entire purchase price after we submitted a request for a refund.  This worked out well for us, since our son got to watch the movie, and we got our money back after our access was revoked.  I upped the review from one star to two star since, let's be honest, Madagascar 2 is no Madagascar, much less Lion King, and I'm kind of glad to not have this in our relatively small queue of movies of which we own digital copies.

My 9-yr old grandson and I watched M:E2A together and reveled in its slapstick comedy.  It characters are ""caricatures"" of some of the world's most recognizeable animals made cutely endearing with  their exaggerated body features and endowed with the ""right"" human voice personality.  We laughed until out of breath at the exaggerated body features made even more hilarious by the dialogue and the impossible slapstick comedy routines during the plane crash, the martial arts, the made up mechanical skills of the monkeys.  It was all in your face humor and we loved it.  Not even the silly romantic understory of a giraffe falling in love with a ""hippie"" hippo lady could spoil  the fun.

Now there telling me even thought I bought the movie and I own it I can no longer watch it due to they have temporarily lost licensing to this. This is like if I went to walmart and I bought a dvd and they showed up to my house and said they lost the licensing to sell it they have to take it back. this is very disappointing and when speaking to the reps which is not there fault they basically say this is amazons policy this is how it works buying digital movies even thought you buy and own them you can no longer watch the movies because they lost rights. I will no longer buy any digital movies and now regret buying a amazon kindle fire because I can not use it for my children like I planned I guess I will just buy a portable dvd player for my car very disappointing amazon,1372723200,3,990,4.005050505050505

3676874,5,B001L1RDVQ,"The Madagascar series is great for family time. Lots of colors, action, and goofiness to keep the kids entertained, but the jokes are almost all meant for adult enjoyment. I think all three of the Madagascar movies are entertaining. Enjoy!",1360886400,,239,5.0
3676875,5,B001L1RDVQ,"Personally, I feel this is an adult cartoon, but little children think it's great because of the animals and they talk, and they have names and are friends.

3676892,4,B001L1RDVQ,"Maybe I'm blind, but I didn't see any of Melvin's Hippo love in the first one. It drives me nuts when a sequel claims that something new was there all along.

3676895,3,B001L1RDVQ,"My husband and I enjoyed this but our son just keeps wanting to watch the first one.

This movie was so funny, tears were running down my face for much of the film. I was laughing so hard. I truly recommend it. It's one of those movies that has humor that works for both children and adults.",1355097600,,377,4.25

3677059,5,B001L1RDVQ,"Mom, Dad, kids, Grandma, Grandpa... yup the whole crew will likely enjoy this installment of the Madagascar series.  There's enough laughs to keep everyone interested and the voice actors really help to bring the point home with their great representations of the characters.  This time these zany animals try to make it home from Madagascar, but the penguin repaired plane doesn't quite make it back to New York city.  Instead, it crash lands in Africa where Alex (the lion) is reunited with his family.  All the animals settle in to what would be their natural habitats, but quickly find out that maybe it's not all what it is cracked up to be.  Gloria wants to be appreciated for who she is, and not her appearance... Marty wants to stand out from the herd again... and the poor giraffe gets convinced of his mortality and ends up blurting out his big secret just in time... there's also plenty of family pride troubles with Alex and his father, which become worked out after a few... overall it is a fun movie packed with some very catchy tunes that the kids will be singing for days.

The Blu Ray looks great, sharp and detailed.  It doesn't look as fantastic as some of the newer films coming out, since it has age and older technology working against it, but the stylized look of the animals helps the movie from looking too dated.  This one comes with a DVD as well, which is nice to have in the car on the go, or for the kids' rooms.",1334620800,,1442,4.477099236641221
