4509007,4,B004ZJ9VHA,"Cowboys and Bandits 50 Movie Pack

These fifty movies are mostly from the 1930s to the early 1940s. These monochrome films are not shown on broadcast TV today but you may remember them from the 1950s and 1960s. These low budget B pictures now run for about an hour. They represent a past culture when most farms, stores, and ranches were owner operated small businesses; few national chains or franchises. Some of these movies are set in the 19th century, others in modern times (automobiles, radios, and telephones). Many were concerned with the economic struggles of that era for economic independence (like the small movie studios against the big studios).

The right to keep and bear arms was well recognized when these films were made. Remember when horses were common on farms and sometimes seen pulling wagons in town? Most are morality plays where those who do right win in the end. These twelve single sided DVDs are not in paper envelopes with the printed titles. A separate booklet describes the movies on each DVD. Here are some of the actors and their number of movies in this collection: Roy Rogers (3); Ken Maynard (4); Kermit Maynard (1); Johnny Mack Brown (2); Buck Jones (2); Tom Tyler (2); Tim McCoy (3); Hoot Gibson (2); Bob Steele (5); Tex Ritter (4); Harry Carey (2); Robert Livingston (2). Here are the names of the movies for each disc:

01 Homesteaders of Paradise Valley; Dawn on the Great Divide; Raiders of Red Gap; Valley of Terror.
02 Silver Spurs; Texas Trouble Shooters; Branded Men; Drum Taps.
03 Last of the Clintons; The Feud of the Trail; The Trusted Outlaw; Raiders of Old California.
04 Law of the Rio Grande; Ghost Patrol; Cavalier of the West; Stormy Trails.

05 Six Shootin Sheriff; The Brand of Hate; Frontier Town; Westbound Stage.
06 Western Mail; Death Valley; Romance on the Range; The Crooked Trail.
07 Terror of the Plains; Wild Horse; The Cowboy and the Bandit; North of Arizona.
08 Son of the Renegade; Ghost Town Law; The Trail of the Silver Spurs; Code of the Fearless.

09 Wolves of the Range; Boothill Brigade; The Fighting Renegade; Trouble Busters.
10 Thunder Over Texas; The Feud Maker; Westward Bound; The Dude Bandit.
11 Last of the Warrens; Roll on Texan Moon; Code of the Cactus; Tombstone Canyon; West of Cimarron.
12 I Killed Wild Bill Hickok; Marked for Murder; Ridin the Cherokee Trail; Thunder in the Desert; The Boss Cowboy.",1357171200,22,2391,4.779661016949152
4509008,5,B004ZJ9VHA,"First of all you shipped early, Got it before Christmas. Thanks.
Anyone who is interested in the ""B"" Western Genre is going to be most pleased
with this set. Great old time stars. Most of these sent in this package are
different then the other Box sets. Just not old titles changed to new.

The Tim McCoy issues are great.
Thanks for putting together a really good cross section of characters and stars.",1356307200,2,403,4.52054794520548
4509009,5,B004ZJ9VHA,i love these old westerns.i have not seen most of them since the t.v.or movie theatre showing in the 1950`s. these movies make you feel young again.,1355616000,,148,4.518518518518518
4509010,5,B004ZJ9VHA,I haven't watched all 50 yet but satisfied with the quality considering when they were made.  Restoration is at least adequate.  My only complaint is the change of the jackets but I suppose that keeps costs down.  I personally like this batch better that one of the other 50s collections I have.,1346025600,3,295,4.634615384615385
4509011,5,B004ZJ9VHA,I have only watched 3 movies and there very good very good picture & sound well worth the price. if you like to watch old westerns then you should buy this one.it's a lot better then most movies made today. no trash talking or nudity. there black&white but thats how I use to watch them in the late 50s & early 60s If you want good clean movies and like old westerns then you can't go wrong buying this one.,1319241600,19,407,4.1
4509012,5,B004ZJ9VHA,"The 5 star rating is because I absolutely love these western collections (I have all their the other western collections). Anyway picture quality will most likely vary greatly, but if you are a western lover like me you will impulsively grab this one as well. I am taking guesses as to which versions some are, as the info on Mill Creek's website is scarce, so keep in mind that this list, with the exception of the titles, is not entirely accurate.

4509015,2,B004ZJ9VHA,"These appear to be mostly ""bootleg"" copies of DVDs originating for the most part from Sinister Cinema.

I have a few of these titles from Sinister Cinema and compared them side by side.  What Mill Creek has apparently done is to edit the screens when the ""SC"" logo appears in the lower right-hand corner so that you lose part of both the right side and bottom of the picture. Some viewers may not notice, but the film has now lost quite a bit of the picture and what remains has been enlarged to fill up the missing space, so the picture will lose some definition.

Yes, these are public domain films so there is nothing apparently illegal about Mill Creek ""borrowing"" a huge number of titles from the original distributor and selling them as their own, but it just doesn't seem right.  On the other hand, you are getting a huge number of somewhat inferior copies at a very low price.  So you make the call.

Personally I prefer to have the entire frame of the picture without any monkey business where the picture is altered.  But, I suppose this is one way to ""preview"" a lot of films before you invest money in the original superior full frame version.  And yes, you do have to consider that even though the Sinister Cinema films show the entire frame throughout and are sourced directly from original 16mm or even 35mm film sources, they will insert a very unobtrusive ""SC"" marker in the lower right-hand corner, but only for the first two or three minutes and then never to return for the rest of the film - so I never really noticed them.  Personally I never found those very tiny initials a problem while viewing... and again it's only for two or three minutes never to return for the remainder of the film.  So either way there are compromises to consider.  But, you should consider that Sinister Cinema offers some great deals these days with multiple movies on a single disc, so the cost of getting excellent and complete prints has recently dropped quite a bit.  Bottom line - you are really not saving a whole lot of money by going second class with Mill Creek.",1469145600,11,2073,4.5133689839572195

The women and men are not all tattooed up, their skins look clean and natural, no colored hair, the scenes do not show sex scenes, etc.  The fact is the times back then were a lot cleaner back then, I think.

I enjoy the very early 1930's cowboy pioneers
in this collection.
I went through and did my my own ordering by years
with 1930 first counting upward.
The theme is about rustlers and con-men,
with some movies that have been remade several time.
The Charles King gets a lot of roles in these movies
and in fact seems more of a regular than the heroes
who come and go. Being a villain in Hollywood was regular work.
I enjoy these films that remind me of LA's channel 11
in the late 50's.",1372204800,3,520,4.262626262626263
