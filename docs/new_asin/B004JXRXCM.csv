4391951,5,B004JXRXCM,"""Shortstoberfest"" is a new collection of shorts from veteran movie-riffers Bill Corbett, Mike Nelson, and Kevin Murphy. Of all the things the guys at Rifftrax produce, it's the shorts collections I love most, and this DVD is no exception.

The shorts selected this time are mostly very good, and some are great. My least favorite short in the collection is ""Back to School with Joan Miller,"" which is an extremely long film full of excruciating (and affordable!) fashions from yesteryear. This is one that was good for the first five minutes or so but became monotonous very quickly. I was also impartial to ""An Aquarium in Action,"" which is about grade school students and their aquarium. I know it sounds titillating, but while it has a few amusing comments, it is not one of the stronger shorts in the set.

On the flip side, there are some great and weird subjects here, too. I was extremely fond of ""Little Lost Scent"" featuring the wanderings and encounters of a baby skunk that's a little more aggressive than might be wise for an animal his size (I know he reeks, but I still give the bear good odds!) The film with the funniest title is ""Drawing For Beginners: The Rectangle."" This one is a very (and I mean very) basic introduction to drawing rectangles of different dimensions. To illustrate their points the filmmakers turn some of the rectangles drawn into three dimensional models! The wonder of it all! ""Call It Free"" is a short that details the mechanical ineptitude of female drivers (and their husbands, too) by showcasing all the convenient services that are provided in a modern gas station. (Or at least used to be.) ""Families: Food and Eating"" shows us mealtime highlights from around the world, and reminds us how truly ugly fashion was in 1970s San Francisco. ""Geography of Your Community"" is a strange little film that delivered far less geography than I expected, but had some great riffing to redeem it.

All told this is a very solid set of shorts, and any fan of MST3K, Rifftrax, or Cinematic Titanic will be sure to find something to love here.",1300233600,6,2074,4.739612188365651
4391952,5,B004JXRXCM,"While channel surfing instead of going out clubbing on a cold winter night back in early 1995 I happened on a show called Comedy Central's ""Mystery Science Theature 3000"". I thought, ok why not i'll give it the 5 minute attention span shot before continuing to surf. I don't remember which episode it was that I watched but that 5 minutes was all it took. One word applies and that word is HILLARIOUS! I was instantly hooked and found myself recording episodes each week on VHS tapes even pause editing out commercials. I even went to the convention the show held in Minneapolis in 1996 and hadda blast. Sadly MST 3k ended. However Micheal J. Nelson, Bill Corbet, and Kevin Murphy the same cast of MST 3k continue to shine on loud and proud with RiffTracks. With the hillarious quips, arcane references, and biting satire that made MST 3k so priceless is ever so present here. I have already started a DVD collection of RiffTracks and will continue to do so. I highly recommend purchasing Shortstoberfest as well as any other RiffTracks from years past. I think you'll agree it's well worth the money.",1299628800,10,1101,4.680412371134021
4391953,5,B004JXRXCM,"Rifftrax Shortstoberfest is 104 minutes of good solid laughs from three of the former stars of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Shorts include:

- Back To School With Joan Miller. An overlong look at some of the tamest, most plaid fashions ever.
- Call It Free. A now nostalgic film about service stations when they actually used to provide service. If you're easily annoyed by stereotype portrayals of women as non-mechanically inclined simpletons with bad driving habits, you better skip this one.
- Little Lost Scent. A fanciful nature film about the adventures of a little skunk.
- An Aquarium In Action. The use of the word ""action"" is a misnomer.
- Drawing For Beginners: The Rectangle. This one is as exciting as it sounds, but it's funny on its own because it's so ridiculously unaware of it's own below-rudimentary approach to art. This is one of my favorites in the collection, great jokes throughout.
- Families: Food And Eating. See how people in a few different parts of the world prepare dinner.
- Beginning Responsibility: Taking Care Of Your Things. A small boy learns how to clean up his room from some toys with creepy voices.
- Geography Of Your Community. The title is a bit misleading, but if you like pottery, it's for you.

I own all the Rifftrax shorts DVDs and I think this is one of the funniest. The material is lightweight and the jokes are dense. It's good escapist humor for nearly two hours. Enjoy!",1298332800,18,1426,4.72289156626506
4391954,5,B004JXRXCM,"One more very good collection, these are really hilarious.  At a time when good comedy movies are few and far between, this is 2 hours of hilarity.",1365379200,,147,4.444444444444445
4391955,5,B004JXRXCM,"These guys are replicating a little of the MST3K sense of humor.  But with a more adult twist on things.  Your kids can still watch it, but these are done with a more mature audience in mind (at least in my opinion).  I get every set that comes out - and I am not disappointed - the laughs keep on coming.  And I am sure that you will be laughing too.",1356739200,,351,3.9014084507042255
4391956,5,B004JXRXCM,What a good product. I watch them it all the time. It shipped very fast and was at my door in no time.,1355184000,,102,3.4782608695652173
4391957,4,B004JXRXCM,"My god, are these shorts terrible.  They're devoid of humor (intentional or otherwise), poorly shot, poorly acted and not even educational.  Thank heavens for the talented riffmeisters, who elevate these better-forgotten pieces of trash into something entirely watchable.  Not just watchable -- enjoyable.",1350864000,,305,6.046511627906977
4391958,5,B004JXRXCM,"If you love MST3k You'll love these short's. I am a huge fam of Rifftrax, and of the original show. Anyone who loves MST Will like any rifftrax production",1342828800,,154,4.344827586206897
4391959,4,B004JXRXCM,"This DVD is hilarious, and the shorts are good for a lot of belly laughs!  This is a must-see for all MST3K fans!",1335744000,,113,3.9130434782608696
4391960,5,B004JXRXCM,I have always been a big fan of MST3K and its a great joy to have Rifftrax to keep my entertained. I think I love the shorts more than anything else. And this one is a great Video of Shorts. Rifftrax never lets me down.,1325116800,,219,3.888888888888889
4391961,5,B004JXRXCM,Shortstoberfest yet another great collection of shorts to be riffed to shreads by the stars of MST3K. My favorite short is -  Call it Free  because the woman in it reminds me of woman I know. If your new to the whole Rifftrax movies this is a good one to start with. I highly recommend it to anyone .,1314576000,,300,4.067796610169491
4391962,5,B004JXRXCM,"I can't add anything that the previous reviews mentioned.  I found it humorous although my husband fell asleep.  Of course, we miss the MST3k puppets, however at least it's the same people & humor.  This one of the better collections of Rifftrax.",1309478400,,246,4.809523809523809
4391963,5,B004JXRXCM,I have most of them and this collection is one of the funniest released by them. Call It Free and Beginning Responsibility are the best ones and the funniest out of all the shorts they have made...very funny!,1301529600,,208,4.5
8432027,5,B004JXRXCM,"No amount of Schnitzengruuben will ever make up for the abject horror of this Shortstoberfest.
I remain shocked and appalled.
Herr Michael so-called ""J"" Nelson and his two socio-political thugs talked over the entire presentation of a number of informative motion pictures.
But, I have to admit, this DVD made the trains run on time.",1487808000,,333,5.072727272727272
8432028,5,B004JXRXCM,Lot's of fun!,1486080000,,13,3.6666666666666665
8432029,5,B004JXRXCM,Great movie.,1481414400,,12,5.5
8432030,5,B004JXRXCM,"The first one is the weakest, but not because the guys are doing a bad job, but because the format is just a different woman standing there 2-3 minutes modeling an outfit, and it goes on for 20 minutes. There's only so much you can do with that.

After that things pick up with Call it Free, and the 'Dizzy Dame'. The other information videos, such as baby skunks having violent encounters with a variety of animals, and a starter video on the fine art of drawing a rectangle, are enjoyable, though Taking Care of Your own Room was probably the best.",1434931200,,550,4.392156862745098
8432031,5,B004JXRXCM,"One of Mystery Science Theater 3000's greatest contributions to pop culture was unearthing the plethora of ancient training & educational films and tearing them apart prior to the show's main feature. These odd films practically beg to be insulted. Their twisted and often completely wrong-headed (though well-intentioned) methods, stories & conclusions are the stuff of drug-induced mania. No one really lived or acted like these films would like us to believe. Rather these were rose-colored interpretations of some perfect anglo-WASPy idealized imaginary world that never did or could exist. These RIFFTRAX ""shorts"" editions are the next best thing to the good old days when MST3K was in its heyday. Mike, Kevin & Bill are keeping that proud tradition alive. Many times with these RIFFTRAX 'shorts' DVDs you get a mix: one or two super-good ones, a few mediocre ones and one or two that are just OK. Luckily for us, in this volume all 8 of these shorts are very funny, with ""Call It Free,"" ""Drawing for Beginners,"" the especially bizarre & disturbing ""Taking Care of Your Own Things"" and ""Geography of Your Community"" among the funniest of ANY in the RIFFTRAX line. The subjects are pleasantly wide-ranging and the guys score almost all direct bull's-eyes with their zingers. The extremely reasonable price makes these 'SHORTS' collections a very cheap investment in some big laughs, with a high replay value. I've watched these several times and they're still funny, even though I know most of the gags. SHORTSTOBERFEST  is a thoroughly fun & funny way to laugh it up for 100 minutes. 5 STARS",1424736000,,1596,5.045454545454546
8432032,5,B004JXRXCM,Funny. On time.,1411516800,,15,4.333333333333333

8432034,5,B004JXRXCM,Ok so just to see Mike and the guys all dressed up--and you already know you are in for a good time! This is one of the Rifftrax shorts that was so funny to me I cant watch it close to bedtime because I laughed so hard the first time it made it hard to sleep!! This one is GREAT to add to your Rifftrax collection!,1395100800,,314,3.772727272727273
8432035,2,B004JXRXCM,It was mediocre. I could have written better script myself. It was not written as well as other rfftrax films.,1394755200,,110,4.55
8432036,5,B004JXRXCM,"Riffing wasn't invented for shorts, but they go together like peanut butter and chocolate. Im a huge fan of the old msty shorts classics, these are just as funny and memorable. I definitely recommend this video to any fan.",1389657600,,222,4.717948717948718
