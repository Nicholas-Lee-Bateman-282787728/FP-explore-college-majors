7925371,5,B00004WIDD,"Watching LaPaglia in Chameleon is like watching Sellers in Dr Strangelove.  For some reason, this has never come out on disc, so I hadn't seen it in years.  But I was delighted to find it on Amazon video",1511308800,,203,4.315789473684211

7925377,5,B00004WIDD,"Awesome acting and enjoyed the story line...The love story mixed with the action always draw me to these types of movies.  The hero of course is not perfect and has his own problems but to meet someone who draws you out even when you do not want it yet find yourself wishing you could, that is how good the actors/actress capture your attention.  Of course, everyone loves a smart and slick villain no hero can be great without an awesome bad guy that must be stopped.",1362528000,,468,4.430232558139535
7925378,5,B00004WIDD,"Anthony LaPaglia really shows off his acting abilities. He portrayed the character from every angle of emotion. I was on the edge of my seat in suspense as to what would take place next. This is definitely a movie where you have to keep your attention on the movie to enjoy every minute of it. I had wanted more even after the movie was over. I really wish they would consider a DVD release as this is one of his great films. This is on my top 10 list of movies. I recommend that you see this movie to see what one mans determination can do. I became a Anthony LaPaglia fan back when I saw his ""Innocent Blood (1992)"" a cute horror/comedy. I really enjoy his newer TV series ""Without a Trace"".",1289433600,,693,4.2180451127819545
7925379,4,B00004WIDD,"This film has a fairly unoriginal premise: cop guy still suffering the death of his family goes out for revenge. The particulars of the crime plot - drugs, money laundering, and other organized crime activity - are also nothing to get worked up about. It's not that they're done badly or even cheesy, but they have all been done before.

What makes this film worth watching is the lead character and the actor who plays him. Willie Serling, played by the wonderful Anthony LaPaglia, drifts in and out of so many false personalities as part of his undercover operations that he's not sure who he is himself anymore. Not only does LaPaglia adeptly handle character changes - moving in and out of accents, mannerisms, gaits, etc. - but he also really brings home the performance of Serling struggling to keep a grip on his own life. LaPaglia's performance is so good that it's easy to forget about the plot issue. Furthermore, the character himself is interesting to watch as he navigates the story.

So don't watch this movie if you're looking for the best crime drama ever, but definitely watch it if you want to see a genius of an actor at work in a thoroughly interesting role.

If you're a fan of movie makeup, that part of this movie alone should entice you. Fabulous work by the makeup crew makes for a fun Spot-The-Agent game on the part of Willie's boss. If the crew didn't get an award for their work, they were robbed.",1097712000,11,1426,4.584313725490196
