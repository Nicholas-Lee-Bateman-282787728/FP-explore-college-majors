322834,5,6300987590,"This is one of the best concert videos I have ever seen.  Prince puts on a clinic, clearly showing his influences musically and in his dancing, such as James Brown & Kid Creole.  I was not a big Prince fan until I saw  this.  There are obviously alot of overdubs, particularly on the vocals but  nevertheless it is a tour de force as Prince clearly demonstrates his all  around talent and mastery of several instruments.  This video kicks butt.",915580800,,444,4.544303797468355
322838,5,6300987590,"I remember this like it was yesterday.  My old worn out VHS copy is still hanging in there, but if Warner Bros. knows what's good for them (and when it comes to Prince, they obviously don't) they'll give this tape the artistic treatment it deserves.
Classic moments.  Absolute classics.  ""I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man"" brings me to tears every time I see it.  They are in such a groove on that song that even a nuclear bomb blast couldn't touch them.  Simply breathtaking playing, wonderful compositions, and high level performances.",1078358400,5,545,4.75531914893617
322839,5,6300987590,"Prince never fails to give a fantastic performance! It was perfect. I loved the roleplay to each song, very sexy and well planned. The sets were also fantastic. and, i've got to say that the show also gave out a dominating note from the ladies in performance. Sheila E was fantastic on drums or as Prince would say, "" Not bad, for a girl!"" A must buy!",1058572800,3,351,4.253731343283582
322840,4,6300987590,"Explored so many other websites that claim to stock this DVD and never came up with the goods for a decent price.
This is one of life's greatest ever music videos, and really does make Michael Jackson look like a wus in comparism.
The quality on DVD is good, with only minimal hiss which you can only expect. It could have done with decent extras though, and only includes pics.",1052179200,,378,4.414285714285715
322841,5,6300987590,"Produced,Arranged,Composed,Written,Directed by Prince himself Say no more but would like to see it on dvd one day till then buy this video it will keep you going, the best concert video ever made and that's the truth!",1029974400,,217,4.891891891891892
322842,4,6300987590,"I've seen the vidio and i loved  it. I love all of prince music, i have most of his music and pictures. He is a great singer. I call him jack of all trades. i've actully seen all of his movies, and have them to. yeah he is an artist. Prince makes great movies he should make more.",1024358400,,280,3.8275862068965516
322843,5,6300987590,"My older sister Portia took me to see this movie on the big screen when it was first released and my life has never been the same since! I truly did not know what to expect, so when it turned out to be a concert film featuring his touring band of 87-88, I was thrilled!
The sheer scope of the the music and the colorful, eclectic way it's presented make this easily the best concert film ever made. The stage set is a duplicate of the great artwork from the album cover and the tunes range from oldies (a brief, joyous sing-along to his classic ""Little Red Corvette"") to the songs comprising his double-LP ""Sign 'O' The Times"". Throughout, Prince plays blazing guitar and even switches to drums, piano and organ on a few tunes. His band is top notch and they're given ample room to prove it on the Charlie Parker instrumental ""Now's The Time"". Sheila E's drum solo steals the show and makes the audience go wild! The film is worth owning for that moment alone!
 If you're not a Prince devotee', this brilliant film and it's music will make you a believer and a fan for life.",1020297600,2,1074,4.37
322844,5,6300987590,"Prince has long been regarded by critics and fans as one of the most engaging live performers on the planet, and he lives up to, and goes beyond, what we ever thought him capable of in this film.  He sings, dances, screams, writhes, entices, flirts, splits and smirks his way through almost all of his Magnum Opus Sign 'O' The Times, and not a second of it is the least bit superfluous or tiresome.  Let me put it very simply.  If you want to see the greatest pure musician living today doing what he does best at the height of his powers, then you must buy this film.",1017100800,4,568,4.2407407407407405
322845,5,6300987590,"This video is all that and a bag of chips! You haven't seen Prince until you seen him live ,but this is the closest thing to it...",1016496000,,130,3.8518518518518516
322846,5,6300987590,"This is one of the best concert films I've ever seen. At this point in his career, as far as live performances go...Prince would have taken out Michael Jackson. You'll realize this when Prince and his band kicks off ""Housequake"". You'll know then that you are watching something special.
You want this video.",1009324800,,308,4.830188679245283
322847,5,6300987590,"One of the greatest concert films ever made. The music, dancing and editing are all exciting. When I saw SIGN OF THE TIMES on the big screen I took my girlfriend. She has always hated Prince's music. And made fun of me for likeing him. After she saw SIGN she changed her tune. She started borrowing all my CD's. And when we broke up she stole my SIGN OF THE TIMES CD. An amazing film!",976665600,,384,4.133333333333334
322848,5,6300987590,"As a Prince fan, this is for me, the highpoint of this man's career. The artistry, musical complexities, and storytelling of his music reach its highest point with this video. It doesn't hurt that he is performing music  from his best album and is working with his tightest musical unit. If you  are a preacher of the Prince faith like am, this is a perfect vehicle to  show the amazing talent of this man to ANY music fan. The footage is well  shot and does justice to the energy and fever of these live performances.  Each song has its own different feel and look yet never feels disjointed  with the other pieces. Another amazing feature of this film is that the  music is reworked and rearranged from the actual studio recording and, like  a fellow reviewer mentioned, I enjoy the sound of the concert arrangements  more than the studio recordings. (I in fact have made an audio recording of  the video, but don't tell Prince he might not like it). Shot for shot and  note for note this is a masterful look at an artist at his highest level of  musical and artistic genius.",960940800,11,1077,4.494845360824742

322850,5,6300987590,"Prince, currently known as: O+-> the artist, Outdoes himself in this concert/play/performance piece.  Displaying all of his talent, Sign O' the Times definitively proves that ""The Artist"" is among the greatest  performers of all time.  To choreograph and produce such a concert  demonstrates his incredible genius.  This is a Must Have for any Prince  fan!",948844800,4,356,5.381818181818182
322851,5,6300987590,This footage and performance was so good I can no longer listen to the studio takes of the songs.  THey just can't compete.,947548800,,123,4.3478260869565215
322852,5,6300987590,"This video should be considered one of the best performances of Prince. Backed for an excellent band, specially Sheila E in the drums, Prince energizes the stage with his music. A must for every fan of Prince or those interested in to know more about his music (this period is the best...is  just music). ""Forever in my life"" is better than in the CD.",932947200,,351,4.484375
322853,4,6300987590,"Admit it. Most music videos have a shelf life. It may be one viewing, it may be three or four years, but there will come a time when you look at that video and think 'I bought that??? What was I thinking!!!'.
This  video will still suffer from that prognosis. However, it does have a long  shelf life, and you may still find yourself returning to it once in a while  just to listen to a couple of tracks (Hot Thing, If I was your  Girlfriend).
It's this that makes it stand out. The mixture of live  performance, set pieces shot especially, and even one video cunningly  crafted in to form part of the concert experience, that makes this  special.
Of course, a pre-requisite to listen and enjoy is to like the  music. Most people like some of Prince's stuff, and this was considered to  be from his best period. Give it a shot if you can get it cheap, try it  anyhow if you're a fan. Remember, it will end up in your loft, in a  cardboard box to be forgotten...until you stumble across it again.",926380800,,995,4.267379679144385
322854,5,6300987590,"In this video, the music recorded is the best what I have ever heard from Prince. And the more new albums Prince makes the more I think the Sign of the times will never be surpassed. For me, even though it is primarily a  video, it is the music that makes it so special. All the tracks are  beautifully played but when it comes to The Cross, you'll hear a song  performed in a way unsurpassed by anything alse ever since. Should I have  one single video or CD by Prince, it would be this.",920592000,,488,4.105263157894737
322855,5,6300987590,"While everybody else was either talking about ""their ADIDAS"" or sampling other artists, Prince continued to write music that probably will not be fully appreciated for about another 10-15 years.  This concert film  captures Prince at his best.  Aside from being visually captivating,  ""Sign of the Times"" shows off Prince's best collection of songs  along with his most explosive ensemble of back-up musicians.",919123200,,410,5.444444444444445

7810612,5,6300987590,"I'm not the biggest Prince fan, but I believe he's very talented and I do own some of his music/video and do enjoy most of his work.
But this concert video is just awesome. A mix of rock, jazz, blues and James Brown/Little Richard influences makes this something to own - even if you're not a big fan.
But I'll be you will be after seeing this. You won't be able to stop appreciating his talent as this is a high energy/sexy/funky experience.
This guy gets it.
By the way - order the DVD from Amazon.com Canada. I did and the quality is excellent.
Go to the ""Canada"" link at the bottom of the page. No big deal paying for it - Amazon accepts your US credit card and does the Canadian money conversion and you get billed the same way you do for US purchases.
VHS doesn't last forever - don't waste money on a VHS in a DVD world.
Enjoy!",1188777600,,834,4.154320987654321
7810613,5,6300987590,"This video shows what Prince can do when he has just the right musicians on stage with him.  The songs come from the album of the same name and they are all very well done.  Each song is very well performed and staged as only Prince can do.  The concert concludes with an amazing version of ""Gonna Be A Beautiful Night"" that allows the other members of the band a chance to show the world what they can do.  This is a must for Prince fans because it is the last chance that you get to see him before he really got a bit on the strange side.  My only regret is that this never made it to DVD.",1174262400,,591,3.9327731092436973
7810614,5,6300987590,"I've been a Prince fan for years and came across this on cable about two weeks ago for the first time.  Amazingly brilliant vocals/guitar work/creative performance by Prince, and Shelia E. was awesome on drums, really fun.  I went to my local mall the following morning obssessed with buying anything Prince.  Unfortunately my Sign O' the Times cassette from back in the day is worn out and I had to special order it on CD...Still waiting!  I forgot what an awesome album it is!  I highly recommend this VHS (don't know anything about the DVD version, sorry).",1125014400,4,559,4.721649484536083
7810615,5,6300987590,"Prince was recovering from the critically panned ""Under the Cherry Moon"" when he recorded, arguably his greatest record ever, ""Sign O' The Times"" and released the concert movie of the same title. I don't know what the man did with this record and the film but he hit the target everytime. From ""Housequake"" to ""If I Was Your Girlfriend"" every song performed live became an experience and made me a Prince fan in the process. This film is least talked about and the folks at Universal or WB should consider releasing this on DVD. Prince's ""Sign O' The Times"" is a hidden gem in Prince's illustrious career.",1114646400,8,605,4.663551401869159
7810616,5,6300987590,"When this hit the big screen back in 1987 I could not see it. I was a mere 13 yrs old and everyone around me gave me a hard time for listening to Prince. Needless to say that those people are no longer a part of my life and SOTT (Sign o the Times) lives on in my heart forever. I still have the album and its maxi singles at home awaiting for me to purchase my self promised turn table to record them. I just cannot wait!!! In the pantheon of rock Prince of old is every bit as amazing in a way the the gloved one could never be. It seperates the hyped ones from the trully gifted people who do more than rely on out dated dancing and empty songs that fade into the furniture. Prince is trully king no matter what the critics may say. This show is trully breathtaking today and a million miles ahead of its time. It is painful to see Alicia Keys attempt to sing (warbble) her way through How Come You don't Call Me Anymore. Why bother when you are NOT Prince??? SOTT features Prince in his second Warner Bros. video release with Sheila E.,the late Boni Boyer,Atlanta Bliss, Miko Weaver, Eric Leeds, and also Dr. Fink (the only remaining member of The Revolution) on keybords in a rousing performance that only serves to put the dance, shimmy, shake, and razzle dazzle on a masterpiece of an album. Among SOTT's highlights are I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man, The Cross, and Forever In My Life. The late Boni Boyer sizzles and sings her heart out on Forever in My Life in this breathtaking performance that is worth the price of admission alone. It is trully because of all the love, labor and effort that went behind this amazing production that Warner Bros. should do everything possible to do this on DVD the right way!!! Everyone is entitled to complain about the inferior DVD and rightfully so however, Warner Bros. is to blame for the mess. I am also a big fan of other groups and have witnessed how we as fans often settle for a little less just to get our fix. It's all a part of keeping the memories alive. It's part of our who we are and how the music reflects and connects with us. The album and film is what people today are still trying to capture. It's astounding that the album did not sell as big as Purple Rain considering that the album is made of the funk, the love ballads, crunchy heavy metal chords, and poetic magic that is every bit as tasty as anything that came before! Don't miss out on this show and album because this is the stuff that is NOW and will always be ahead of its time. Do yourself a favor and buy this album and VHS tape show. It will only make you a better listener.",1088208000,3,2616,4.244488977955911
7810617,5,6300987590,"'Sign O' The Times' is the most accomplished album Price ever
made and he's made some classics. And this extremely well filmed
concert movie strings togther pure live footage and performances
excerpted for his MTV videos of the period. The live version of
""Forever In  My Life"" (one of my top ten favorite Prince songs)
kicks the PANTS off the album version. But Prince-what is the
buisness about squirrel meat?And IS life nothin' but a muffin?
Sometimes this guys conversation baffles me but you just can't
fault his sublime musical taste. He's a bit Chuck Berry,Hendrix,
Santana and even Liberace (in dress sometimes,anyway) all rolled
into one unique musical ball. A sheer delight all through!",1084233600,2,696,5.052173913043478
