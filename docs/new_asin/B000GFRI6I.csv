2608151,3,B000GFRI6I,"I sat down to watch this film with next to no knowledge of architecture. I was a blank slate on which Sydney Pollock could draw the myth of Frank Gehry in a convincing fashion. In the end I was convinced of his genius even if the film left a little to be desired. We follow Gehry around during his public and private life. He talks about his past and his family, and we get to see him working on various projects. That is basically the whole of the film. Pollock is not only the director but also a star as he carries a camera and has a camera follow him. There are traces of ""William Eggleston in the Real World"" here, and since that film was the worst of last year that is not a compliment. The camera does stay on Gehry for an unusually long time as he spouts off as though he were some sort of oracle. A lot of times nothing but gibberish is coming out of his mouth. Ultimately Gehry is much better company than Eggleston which prevents it from falling into that pit.

The thing that defines Gehry, according to this film, is his willingness to be viewed as a radical within his own profession. At one point the even states that there are just some things about his profession that bug him. What is unique about this complaint is that he presents it as though he were the first person to ever feel this way. Everybody feels that way, Gehry however if one of the rare people who stand up to his annoyance. As is the norm, Pollock brings in Gehry's groupies to sing his praises. Then, in the name of fairness I suppose, he brings in a ""naysayer"" to try and counteract everything that had been said before. This guy puts on his Andy Warhol voice and begins to pontificate about how the only thing Gehry does is create spectacles. Well I sure like spectacles, don't you? Especially in a world a forced similarity isn't it refreshing to see something buck the trend, any trend? There were a few of his works that didn't work on me. The segment on his fish stage had me flashing back to ""Art School Confidential"" and hearing John Malkovich say that he was one of the first to do the triangles. The chain link fence designs did seem a little pretentious to me, but it was so out there that I had no choice but to appreciate the audacity. And that's kind of the point, the more he switched it up the more I liked it. The film itself was a straight shooter that had no agenda and never strutted for the audience. It was brief, never lost focus, and was, in general, a good time. All of this came as something of a shock to me. Those attributes I listed above also, from time to time, worked against the film. ""Sketches of Frank Gehry"" was the equivalent of a cookie-cutter suburban two story. A well made two story, sure, but still cookie-cutter. Bland and status quo and something that would be embarrassed to be standing next to a Frank Gehry masterpiece. I have nothing bad to say about this film, just not enough good to recommend it. ***",1165104000,2,2937,4.320652173913044
2608152,4,B000GFRI6I,"""Sketches of Frank Gehry"" is director Sydney Pollack's first foray into documentary filmmaking, a personal quest to understand the work of his longtime friend, the Western world's most famous architect, Frank Gehry. Upon seeing Gehry's most famous work, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, at its opening in 1997, Pollack asked himself, ""Where did this come from?"" A question in the minds of many who have been transfixed by the Bilbao's metallic curves that rise organically from the Earth while they ironically convey otherworldliness. Pollack approaches the film with a layman's understanding of architecture and an intense desire to understand why and how Frank Gehry creates as he does. Gehry is at ease with his friend and speaks freely of his background, his career, and his ambition. Pollack was apprehensive about placing himself in the film, but his presence personalizes the exercise and introduces a dialogue between these 2 men who both ""try to find personal expressiveness within disciplines that make stringent commercial demands"".

The greatest insight into Gehry's creative process and the evolution of his styles comes from Gehry himself. But clients, artists, writers, museum curators, Gehry's design partners, and his psychoanalyst Milton Wexler all contribute their perspectives on the man and his work. We see some works in progress and briefly tour some of Gehry's buildings: private residences, museums, and commercial buildings. The only Frank Gehry detractor who agreed to participate in the film is Hal Foster, Princeton University Professor of Art & Architecture. I would have liked to hear more dissenting opinion -or more balanced opinion- since the praise of Gehry's work becomes repetitive. Foster articulates only some of Gehry's weaknesses. Frank Gehry works very well with light, and his best buildings have lines that are utterly symphonic. But he has persistent aesthetic and practical shortcomings. In any case, ""Sketches of Frank Gehry"" is an inviting, insightful documentary that gives an impression of transparency, to match Gehry's buildings.

The DVD (Sony Pictures 2006): There is a ""Q&A with Sydney Pollack"" (34 min) from the Los Angeles premiere of the film. Pollack discusses how he approached the subject of Frank Gehry's work, being neither a documentarian or an architecture buff, but a layperson trying to understand the mind behind the buildings. He talks about the process of making the film and his intention to make a documentary that relates in style to traditional documentaries as Gehry's architecture relates to traditional architecture. And he takes some questions from the audience. Subtitles for the film are available in French.",1164412800,21,2695,5.429594272076372
2608153,5,B000GFRI6I,"While I am not a student of architecture and only know the barest outlines of some aspects of its history, I know how strange the Bilbao museum seemed to me when I first saw it.  Who did that?  Who is Frank Gehry?  Why?  Then I had to ask myself if I like it or not.  It surely was interesting and it has grown on me over time.  Not all of Gehry's work is beautiful to me, but that can't be considered testimony for the prosecution.  It may just be I don't know enough about what is being attempted or what has been accomplished with that building.

This really neat movie lets us get to know Gehry a bit on a personal level.  We get to see him working with his team, his interaction with some works as they progress towards realization and, best of all, Gehry interacting with the reality he (and his team) designed.  One of the best moments in the film is him walking through a building in Germany that he will likely only see a couple of times in his what remains of his life and as he walks along and touches a wall to feel the dream made real.  It is a quite and unremarked moment, but a beautiful one.

Love his work or hate it, his vision of buildings as sculpture has changed the way many buildings are done nowadays.  He and his team took advantage of what computers and new materials offer to free us up from boxes.  Likely, others will do it better, but Gehry is a pioneer.  One of those commenting on Gehry's works noted that while many of our buildings come from history and we enjoy them, there is only one history that we live in and Gehry is a part of it.  He is one of the few that have changed the world and we need to take note of it.

I do feel that I know more about Gehry and enjoyed seeing his works and his work process.  While I am not completely won over, I do feel better about his work and feel more comfortable that I know more about what is going on with those strange shapes and materials.  And that is interesting to me.",1163635200,,1952,4.116402116402116
2608154,4,B000GFRI6I,"There simply is no more controversial architect in the world today than Frank Gehry and people have very strong opinions about his work.  He has both his passionate lovers and haters.  I am one of the very few who is somewhat in the middle.  I really love some of his work, while I find some of his work to be quite off putting.  The person in the film who probably got it better than anyone is a sympathizer of Gehry's work, art critic Claude Jencks (the person who popularized the term ""postmodern"").  Jencks, for whose deceased wife Gehry designed a memorial building, states bluntly that Gehry has made some ugly buildings.  I think with Gehry more than most architects, one must give oneself the freedom to hate or love his individual buildings without inhibition.  Whatever else one may say about Gehry, he isn't like other architects.

One reviewer below called this a ""puff piece,"" but that isn't really correct.  It is more correct to call it a conversation with a friend.  Gehry asked his close friend, the mainstream director Sydney Pollack, to make a documentary of his work.  The result is a fine portrait of Gehry's career.  Pollack certainly does not criticize his work, but interestingly he does not over praise it either.  They do call attention to the fact that many simply don't like his work and the film contains numerous excerpts from one of Gehry's more vociferous and respected critics, Hal Foster.  But the point of the film is not to provide an objective and critical overview of Frank Gehry's work.  The point is to get to know Frank Gehry and some of his ideas about architecture.  In this the film succeeds marvelously.

If one watches a number of documentaries about architects, one thing that is striking is how many of them are enormously likable individuals.  For every irascible Frank Lloyd Wright there are ten you'd love to sit down and have a beer with.  Much like I. M. Pei, Frank Gehry comes across as an immensely likable guy in this film.  Perhaps away from his friend's camera he is an implacable tyrant, but those qualities, if they exist, are not apparent here.  Instead, he comes across as a genuinely nice guy.  In fact, a couple of the individuals interviewed stress that as laid back as Gehry is, he really does have an ego.  I don't think I've ever heard a person in the creative field have anyone insist that appearance aside, they really do have an ego.  In the vast majority of cases, that is all too apparent.

I found it interesting to see the shots of Gehry and either of his design partners working with him on designs.  If you are accustomed to think of architecture as akin to drafting, watching Gehry work is a bit of a shock.  He doesn't design so much as sculpt.  He and his partners look like a couple of extremely mature kindergartners with scissors and paper as they cut, bend, shape, snip, and play with variations on the model they are struggling with.  There is apparently little or no concern with the particular materials to be used.  He seems rather to struggle with the kind of overall shape, with the assumption that with today's materials any kind of design can be turned into a reality.  The film really brings out how Gehry's own conception of architecture is much closer to sculpture than to engineering.

As a resident of Chicago, a city noted for his importance to twentieth century architecture, it has been amazing to realize how little of his work has been done here.  In fact, apart from his controversial (what else?) work in Millennium Park, I'm not aware of anything else he has done here.  As a result, I have less direct experience with Gehry's work than many other leading architects.  I must confess that much of what I see appears to be fascinating.  I would, for instance, absolutely love to see his Bilbao museum.  But there is one aspect to Gehry's work that I really applaud:  its emphasis on individualism.  One criticism of much architecture has been its essential conservativism.  Much of it espouses nonegalitarian and conformist values.  One sees exceptions, such as Louis Sullivan's refusal to put box seats in his Chicago Auditorium design.  If one looks at a Gehry design, it is hard to imagine it ever becoming the style of choice of a repressionistic, totalitarian regime.  It is too individualistic, too anarchic for that.  Even such a free spirit as Louis Kahn still designed the capitol of Bangladesh.  But it is simply impossible to imagine Frank Gehry designing a capitol.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I came away from it with a greater liking for Frank Gehry as a person than I had anticipated.  And perhaps I will in the future be more inclined to appreciate his designs.  He may not be the greatest of our architects, but he certainly is one of our more likable free spirits.",1163289600,3,4793,4.696278511404562
2608155,2,B000GFRI6I,"Sydney Pollack is all too present, here.  Pollack and Gehry had a friendship that predated the making of the film.  With that duly noted, it must further be observed how grating it is to watch Pollack--the safe, calculating, and often shallow journeyman of commercial Hollywood--sit and compare his travails as a filmmaker with Gehry's true daring as an architect and modern artist.

This is a film about Sydney Pollack collecting and arranging images.  It comes up short in exactly the ways his fictional films come up short.  Pollack has previously taken vibrant source material from the likes of Tennessee Williams, Horace McCoy, Erich Maria Remarque, Isak Dinesen, and Billy Wilder, only to embalm it in pretty images--here, he takes a man who embodies the perils of modern art and reduces him to that most belittling of categories: the unchallenged genius.

To be fair, there is a token architectural critic who speaks for the anti-Gehry camp, but he is dismissive of Gehry's entire body of work--Gehry deserves to be challenged, not dismissed.  To be sure, he is a visionary.  He has created works of indisputable greatness.  As Julian Schnabel observes of the Bilbao Guggenheim Museum, ""It has the scale of Egypt.""

The conceit of this film is that it shows Gehry's work from sketch to models to completion.  My gripe with it is that it whitewashes the key ingredient of all great art:  failure.  The process of going out on a limb and falling off, vital to any art form, is ignored.  Gehry's own insecurities are hinted at, but the elephant in the room is that, over time, his iconoclasm has morphed into a strange sort of conservatism.  Oddly, Frank Gehry's therapist is on camera several times, but the effect of his remarks is to emphasize that Gehry became his own therapist and eventually became therapist to the therapist.  Why put such a figure in the film except as a sort of slight of hand?  To show that the filmmaker knows precisely what he has left out by pretending to include it?

In a rare moment of honesty, Pollock allows us to hear from architect Charles Jencks, for whom Gehry built, pro-bono, a lovely memorial to his deceased wife.  Jencks, who obviously loves Gehry with clearer vision than Pollack, says, ""The truth is, some of his work is extremely ugly.""

I have had the privilege of watching, day-by-day, as one of Gehry's ugliest buildings went up.  I have puzzled over it from distant hills, from street level, and from inside.  (A few curves of it are shown in about 15 seconds worth of rain-drenched footage, without naming it.)  It is breathtaking in its failure as art and truly repugnant as architecture.

And yet, in its audacity, it tells the story of Frank Gehry's greatness better than all 90 minutes of Pollack's laundered interviews and post-card views.",1161561600,6,2800,4.846315789473684
2608156,4,B000GFRI6I,"Even though I have since seen the Experience Music Project in Seattle and the Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago, I was first taken by Frank Gehry's work when I accidentally came upon the eye-catching ""Fred and Ginger"" building in Prague in 1999, an eccentric juxtaposition of a cylindrical concrete building and a free-flowing glass tower that does indeed look like the classic dancing pair. Director Sydney Pollack has taken time out of his commercial filmmaking to make a mostly winning documentary about his close friend, the world-renowned architect. It's a warm and low-key look at Gehry's creative process which obviously parallels Pollack's own. In fact, the film is structured as an intimate conversation between the two and the joy of the film comes from the unexpected revelations that only happen between friends, in particular, how Gehry broke with tradition at an early age to design wildly original buildings that people either abhor or revere.

With a relative minimum of his own narcissism, Pollack is able to convey Gehry as a curious mix of self-effacing outsider and proud non-conformist and uses not only Gehry's own musings but the perspectives of others to provide evidence of both sides of the man. Not too surprisingly, Gehry's long-time therapist Milton Wexler provides the most perceptive comments about his patient's internal creative struggles, but there are also insightful remarks from Gehry's colleague, the late Philip Johnson; Herbert Muschamp of the New York Times; and architecture critic Hal Foster, the only one to offer a dissenting view of Gehry's work.

Unfortunately, in an attempt to broaden the audience for his film, Pollack has also included several celebrities, whose opinions about Gehry border on the banal, for example, film industry heavyweights Michael Ovitz, Michael Eisner and Barry Diller; Dennis Hopper who lives in a Gehry-designed house; and Bob Geldof who just happened upon the Gehry-designed Vitra Design Museum while on tour. Director Julian Schnabel provides some funny moments as he shows up in a bathrobe, sunglasses and with a brandy snifter, especially as he talks about the audacity of Gehry's work and makes a classic analogy with Robert Duvall's performance in ""Apocalypse Now"".

However, the best moments are Gehry at work with his design partners Craig Webb and Edwin Chan, as they innocently start designs with construction paper and a pair of scissors. Pollack's cinematic skills come into play when he showcases the designs of Gehry's most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, the Walt Disney Concert Hall in LA and the DG Bank Building in Berlin. With long takes and compositions set against adjacent buildings, we can appreciate what Gehry was trying to achieve in making his designs compatible with the environs. Instead of the montage provided in the film, a more comprehensive and annotated image catalogue of his work would have been more helpful in order to understand the changes in Gehry's designs as his career progressed. Other than previews for several recent documentaries, the only extra on the 2006 DVD is an illuminating half-hour Q&A session with Pollack moderated by director Alexander Payne.",1156723200,11,3193,5.269155206286837

2608159,5,B000GFRI6I,"Frank Gehry is mentor for me. I never met him. I am not an architect. Of course I am not famous. So why is my mentor?  Because he was a failure as long as he pretended to be what other wanted him to be: his first wife, his fellow architects, his teachers. Sheldon Pollack is not only the director of the movie. Is Frank's friend who believed in him. There was a moment, well in his 40's when Frank was nearly broke.  He realized he is not an architect; he is an artist. He looks like a suburban family man. He is not. He looks fragile. He is not. The movie is advertised as a documentary. It is more than that.

I was required to write an essay on an architect or designer of my choice and I chose Frank Gehry, so when I realized their was a documentary on him and his work, of course I had to watch it! Generally speaking, I enjoy watching documentaries anyway, so that was a plus for me. If it weren't for the assignment, though, I likely never would have known who he was or bothered to see this movie. That being said, it did give me some valuable information to use. Frank Gehry has done some amazing things.",1418774400,,578,4.263636363636364
2608161,3,B000GFRI6I,"No insight into how Gehry's mind thinks. He says something, someone else cuts the paper and tapes it in place. Really? And his 'sketches' only he can understand them. Although Pollack tries to present a history of Gehry's career, it appears to be a focus on where he is now. Many background items mentioned but not followed up with. I was hoping for more. The complexity of his building designs require unique engineering yet none of that was shown. (Except for a construction site visit of the Disney Hall.)

As Picasso, Van Gogh, Freud, Darwin and many other genius, Frank Gehry tells about his confronts with bad critics and low minded architects that try do diminish his work. This DVD is an example of life and how society sabotates all that is genius and bright.

2608174,5,B000GFRI6I,As an architect myself I found this DVD to provide a fascinating behind the scenes look at the creative process of one of the preeminant architects of our time. Sydney Pollack's layman approach to direction with hand-held camera work and one-on-one interviews gives a skillful perspective that demystifies Frank Gehry's growth as an architect. Gehry's early work at Vitra to the celebrated Museum in Bilbao Spain (which many have compared on equal footing with Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Water house as the greatest commercial piece of architecture in the last 100 years ) are all celebrated here with plenty of video documentation. It is very clear early on in this documentary that Sydney Pollack was the right choice for the job of documenting Frank's ascension as one of the top designers practicing today. Sydney's friendship with Gehry clearly shows through and keeps Gehry's guard down so that we all benefit from this deeply personal look at how Gehry's early personal life struggles give way to a steely determination to become an architect and designer at the highest level of his trade. HIs firm's unique use of model making and computer generated explorations of each design are highlighted as they move from Frank's scribbled sketches to ultimate construction to stand the tests of time. I couldn't recommend this DVD higher !,1263254400,2,1341,5.1

Having visited many of Frank Lloyd Wright's work in northern Illinois and now living in a Pacific NW city also blessed with outstanding architects, I've a respect and love for the work of Gehry. The depth allowed shows a master's processes both amazingly collaborative and child-like. It brings back Wright's recollections of playing with blocks as art born from simplicity. Frank has the advantage now of Computer Aided Design although his fascination with fish matches Wright's past.

Bilboa is awesome but a venture into the Seattle Experience work would've been welcome too. So it goes.

I just wish it had more sketching in it...really showing the master-builder at work...but, then again, maybe that would spoil the cosy atmosphere that i really liked! Great documentary for Gehry admirers and a must see for all architects!",1227139200,,627,5.1568627450980395
2608180,4,B000GFRI6I,"I believe Syd Pollack is the premier moviemaker of my generation.  I believe Frank Gehry is one of the Top 3 architects of this period.  My interest in architecture/film led me to see this documentary more for the Pollack influence than for Gehry.  But, I also have a very close friend who is friends with the Pollack's AND had a relationship with Gehry on previous boards in the 80s.  AND, his art collection includes a ""fish lamp"" in his living room.  Spellbound by the story of being offered over $100,000 for this, this, LAMP, I felt it was time to explore Gehry's work in more depth, a two for one.

This DVD is not for commercial sucess, it is a labor of love between two friends.  Pollack has no reason to do this other than a love and appreciation for another artist.  And Gehry has no reason to be so forthcoming and delve back into his life except to satisfy his friend.  So what this becomes is just an open discussion between friends centered around architecture and career.

I must now admit that I am not a large fan of Gehry's architecture.  It is too abstract for me.  I prefer balance and clean lines and Gehry is about creation and a unique thought process.  But I can appreciate the artistry even if it is not my favorite artwork.

This is an important DVD and should be watched as it is a reflection of American artistry from 1960 forward by two masters.  But more so, two years later, due to the passing of Syd Pollack, a true legend of a film director.  So I am touched and grateful for having watched this shortly before Pollack's death and having also sent this DVD to two other friends to watch and discuss and enjoy the work of Gehry.  But also for one more reason:  Gehry late in the DVD describes his fascination with the body of a fish and Pollack flashes pictures of the many buildings with unique structure which you can now clearly see are designed like a fish.  But it all started with an unattractive lamp......",1217894400,,1945,4.428169014084507
2608181,3,B000GFRI6I,"Outside of Ayn Rands, The Fountainhead, I knew nothing of architecture. After watching, Sketches of Frank Gehry, by Sydney Pollack, I still know nothing of architecture; save identifying a Gehry building when I see one. I bought the movie because I'm a Sidney Pollack fan; unfortunately, I was duped because I thought the movie was a bit narcissistic. This was not the typical Pollack depth and/or quality.",1212019200,,406,5.074626865671642

2608184,5,B000GFRI6I,In this documentary I was able to view his character and the way he thinks and works. As an artist this film benefited me to know his creative process and who he is as a person. I found it interesting that his long time therapist was interviewed and talked about how the therapy could help him to do what he wanted to do when his ideas were too different to be accepted and implemented. I think anyone who is interested in architecture even a little bit would enjoy this film. I also think that if you watch this film without knowing who he is will most likely identify some of the buildings he designed because they are in many major cities in the world and also because his design is recognizable.,1194480000,,699,4.343511450381679
2608185,5,B000GFRI6I,"How can one rate what is essentially a conversation between friends?  Mr. Gehry's creativity, personality, and individuality are brilliantly portrayed in this film.  I feel closer to understanding Gehry as an architect and as a person.  Thank you Mr. Gehry and Mr. Pollack for pursuing your passions and sharing them with us in this delightful yet involving piece.  I am compelled to visit/view more of your works.",1188086400,2,414,5.134328358208955
2608186,5,B000GFRI6I,"This documentary is very a entertaining and insightful record of the way that Frank Gehry works. Gehry comes over as a very modest person although his work is just the opposite. I was fascinated with his approach which is more that of an artist than of an architect. I was a student of the late Louis I Kahn and his approach to the design process was very much deeper and philosophically driven than is Gehry's. The documentary, however, gives a frank and clear view of his design approach and any architect who is remotely interested in Gehry's architecture should have this DVD in his bookshelf. Gehry is, no doubt, one of the most influential yet controversial architects of our time.",1186617600,,687,4.733333333333333
2608187,5,B000GFRI6I,"This is an excellent documentary/portrait/tribute to a most amazing person, the architect who took the whole concept of architecture by the scruff of the neck and turned it upside down. His absolute freedom of shape - always related to some underlying concept, possibly almost simple,like a boat's sails, or possibly something much more abstract that we can only intuit - has drawn worldwide attention and mostly, awe.

There are naysaying voices, and some are given their chance to speak in the film: to me, the one that perhaps had a point was that one museum was so overpowering in itself that it diminished the artwork shown inside it. However, this was countered by quotes from artists, who loved being shown there, and in another arena, by the director of the New York Phil who said how delighted he was by Gehry's absolutely firm stance that for a concert hall, the music was the very first thing and everything else was secondary.

One of the best descriptions of the impact of a Gehry building is in the interview with the film's director, Sidney Pollack, in the additional material on the DVD. Pollack, although a long-time friend of Gehry, had never had any particular interest in architecture, but when he first saw the famous museum in Bilbao, he says that it stopped him in his tracks. It was almost like entering a dream. The building seemed to make sounds, a music that got inside your head. It could be something that had been built by Don Quixote - stoned!

There was a revealing statement at the end, by Gehry's long-time therapist, who also shed light on Gehry's personal history (not that that is so important as the works themselves) - ""when most people come to me, they want help in sorting out their lives, their troubles, their relationships. When artists come to me, they want to know how to change the world.""  (my quote is not exactly word for word, but close). Not a bad summary of what this film shows us.",1176163200,,1935,4.682352941176471
2608188,3,B000GFRI6I,"When I use light to depict this documentary, it doesn't mean it's insubstantial.  Rather, it's a very unpretentious portrayal of a superarchitect who's been brought into the limelight after the completion of the Guggenheim Museum at Bilbao, Spain.  Because this documentary is for the mass audience, Frank gets his friend, Sydney Pollack, an Oscar winning Director (of Out of Africa fame) to direct this project.  Frank believes that he's the right man for the job because Sydney knows nothing whatsoever about architecture. Could this be Frank's attempt in controlling or manipulating the direction of how the documentary is made? Whatever that is, the documentary is entertaining to sit through as we wandered back to the days when he was merely a truck driver; why he had his family name changed; his association with his artist friends that sowed the seed for him to see architecture differently from other architects that are trained in a more structured & formal manner; his admission that to date he's still unable to use a computer & the irony is that without CATIA (a software used to design aerospace crafts) he's unable to build his signature architectural pieces; his dependence upon his team to interpret shapes & forms on his behalf; his own admission about his huge ego etc. Some works of his are featured here such as Walt Disney Hall at LA, Guggenheim Museum at Bilbao, Cancer Centre dedicated to Charles Jencks' deceased wife at Scotland, his own avantgarde house at Santa Monica, & the list continues.  For those that hope to get a technical dissection of how or where he derives his inspiration from would be sorely disappointed because Frank simply touches the surface lightly.  This documentary doesn't say where he's heading next but based upon his comment that now, he's able to pick and choose projects that entice him, it's only forseeable that his future is as bright as ever.  Compounded by the fact that all major cities in the world are looking for iconic buildings to have the Bilbao effect, that is revitalising local economy through tourism, demand for his service shall not be diminished any sooner.  A must-see for Frank Gehry's fan.",1175904000,,2168,4.972375690607735
2608189,5,B000GFRI6I,I never thought a documentary about architecture could be so fascinating.  Sydney Pollack does an excellent job of delving into Frank Gehry's techniques and the controversy over his buildings.  More interesting than you might imagine.,1172793600,,234,5.6571428571428575

2608191,5,B000GFRI6I,"In this documentary by his friend Sydney Pollack we meet Frank Gehry (b. 1929), winner of the Pritzker Prize (1989) and controversial rebel rule-breaker in the world of architecture. We also meet colleagues in his firm who contribute to his deconstructionist designs, clients, business executives Mike Eisner and Barry Diller, artists, musicians, a dissenting critic from Princeton, and even Gehry's therapist of thirty years, all of whom comment on Gehry's life and work. I especially enjoyed the considerable time spent in Gehry's studio watching the artistic process unfold with paper models, computer simulations, pen sketches, and so forth. A beautiful sound track accompanies a cinematic tour of his notorious creations around the world, including his signature piece, the titanium-covered Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. Critics complain that his work is perverse, tortured, ugly, and dissonant, but most people acknowledge the remarkable genius of a man from a poor Jewish family who early in his life drove a truck for two years.",1169596800,,1042,5.478260869565218
2608192,5,B000GFRI6I,"Really wonderful, warm, intimate portrait of an artist, an artist at work, and his work.  Loved the dynamic between Frank and Sydney, the informality and obvious mutual admiration.  Two lions with an approachable, relatable tone.  The filming approach brought so much to the story, brought out the person behind the persona, the essence of genius.  Absolutely loved it.

2608195,5,B000GFRI6I,"Sketches of Frank Gehry has a simple goal and is very open about it.  It is a conversation between friends who over the years have gained respect for each other and learned from each other.

This isn't a biography. This isn't an insightful exploration of architectural history.

It is a movie about an artist who has found a canvas for his work and the ability to now explore without restraint his artistic vision.  The canvas is space itself, explored through architecture.

As such it's more a movie about the artistic process and the artistic soul.  We don't learn many details about either Gehry or the science. We do learn about the spirit of a man who really does see the world as more open than most of us, and who wants to change it through a particular medium.  As a movie about art it reminds me of Rivers and Tides, though not as lyrical.

Sketches of Frank Gehry is interesting and inspirational, brilliant and simple.  A wonderful movie in its simplicity, as long as you are willing to accept it for what it is -- a conversation between masters  we are privileged to overhear.",1167350400,2,1089,4.56701030927835
2608196,4,B000GFRI6I,"'Sketches of Frank Gehry by Sydney Pollack' is a delightful excursion.  Though this viewer has grown tired of Sidney Pollack's proclivity toward putting himself into his own movies - an act that seems like a huge ego trip that rarely wears well - and where that matter of self-imposition on his own projects is not always successful, here Pollack is dealing with the inimitable, spontaneous, self-deprecating, funny and altogether delightful Frank Gehry.  It simply works.

The film is a dialogue among the factors that influence the creation of the artifices that Gehry has created throughout the world, architectural doodlings that result in surprisingly well thought-out buildings.  Not all of his works are laudatory, but when his nonchalant discarding of tried and true architectural rules result in the bending of light and sound the way they so strongly work in, say, the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the man's genius steps forward.

Pollack seems to have a great time with his friend Gehry as they converse and peruse the many buildings (and the aside people involved in their growth from pencil doodles to reality).  The balance between entertainment and education works for this viewer.  For anyone interested in how the Madhatter of architecture (think Gaudi with steel!) thinks through his creations is bound to find pleasure in viewing this very fine little film.

I thought it was interesting to see Gehry in the middle of end of the century art movements and artists, but really I didn't see the point of or reason for admiration for his house surrounded by a chain link fence.  I have driven around Los Angeles since seeing the movie, and my husband and I label every corrugated metal roof as a ""gehry.""  So I guess seeing the movie has provoked a lot of fun for us.  I definitely think it was more worth seeing the movie than seeing the exhibit at LACMA.  The real discussions about how to change a model were more interesting than seeing the models themselves.",1447286400,,705,4.343511450381679
