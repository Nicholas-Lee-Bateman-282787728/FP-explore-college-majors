308392,4,6301039459,"It is remarkable to me just how much these early Sherlock Holmes' movies influenced the later James Bond films.  Ian Fleming makes reference to Sherlock in From Russia With Love, where the Russians refer to the English as having a Sherlock Holmes mentality with regard to James Bond within the British Secret Service.
More remarkable to me is the trademark of - as Dr. Evil would put it - putting Sherlock Holmes in an easily escapable situation by planning an overly elaborate and exotic death and then not actually witnessing his demise but assuming that all goes to plan.  I mean, this is Sherlock-Freaking-Holmes here, don't you think that he's going to think of a way out of that garage?
At this stage in the game, without Professor Moriarity  to chase around, Holmes is usually pitted against a femme fatale, as in the case of this movie.  It is another pleasant mystery in which Holmes must crack a code and then rescue the MacGuffin before the bad guys do.  I especially appreciate the nod to Samuel Johnson and Boswell, whose relationship was the precursor to Holmes and Watson.",1075161600,3,1087,4.76063829787234
308393,3,6301039459,"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce star in their final film as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  This time, the duo is on the tracks of a gang stealing music boxes that mysteriously hold key information that will lead to much money.  The music boxes are made in prison by a bank robber, who encodes the clues, but they are sold at an auction before his partners can buy them.  There's nothing they won't do to get their hands on the boxes, including murder.  There's not much new in this film that hasn't been seen in the other films of the series, although the music box angle is an interesting way of transferring information.  Rathbone doesn't play this one with much energy ... maybe he was getting tired of the role, while Bruce is his usual, bumbling self.  Although hardly the best in the series, fans of the duo will want to check it out.",1030233600,14,841,4.428571428571429
308394,3,6301039459,"If you want a rainy afternoon B flick that doesn't involve your brain too much - this one is for you. The characters are fun but can't be rated based on the Sherlock Holmes stories themselves. They lack the complexity that Holmes fans have come to love in the novels. Dr. Watson is a bit of a ninny, but lovable. At times his comments are less than elementary. Nigel Bruce is a fun character as Watson though and plays well next to Basil Rathbone. Rathbone makes a good Holmes and I had the distinct impression that he could have handled a more complex script. The Holmes he's given to play does not seem as bright as Doyle's Holmes. There is no emphasis on Holmes'amazing power of observation - which I missed. An oddity too is that Holmes actually is cooperating with Scotland Yard and they with him - something unheard of in the stories. But then again, this is a B film and should be enjoyed for the era it was made. The other thing that was slightly odd was the modern 40's setting - this threw me for a bit of a loop.
Bottom line - if you want to enjoy this film - don't go into it expecting an accurate representation of the literary characters. In fact, don't expect any real representation at all except for the identical names. Simply appreciate the fun, film noir setting of the 40's and look forward to a Saturday afternoon flick that will momentarily give your brain a rest from anything complex. Ironically, this film is very elementary. Save your mental workouts for Jeremy Brett.",982108800,,1495,4.47985347985348
308395,4,6301039459,"Not one of the best in the series of the Rathbone/Bruce series but none the less one of the classics. If your a Basil Rathbone fan as many of you are, this one is a good one to add to your collection.",964396800,5,200,3.7857142857142856

It is a great story of 3 music boxes and the lady that does anything she can to get her hands on them. You might think Sherlock is a goner at one point, but there is more than one game of smoke and mirrors going on! If you've never seen Rathbone as Holmes or have never seen this movie before, this version is a must see. The B&W video is nice and bright, although choppy in places.

308648,4,6301039459,"Sherlock Holmes  Dressed to Kill

The film begins with a view of snowy Dartmoor Prison. Prisoners manufacture music boxes for sale to the public at an auction. Later a man shows up, he wanted to buy all three. Can he find the purchasers? Is there some crime involved? An old friend of Dr. John Watson visits to tell about the theft of a music box. Sherlock Holmes is interested. Why would a thief steal a cheap item and pass up more expensive items? Was this a mistake? Mrs. Hilda Courtney visits Julian Emory. Will Emory pay attention to the warning? Sherlock Holmes questions the seller of those music boxes. Holmes & Watson visit one customer and discover something wrong.

The gift shop is under surveillance, but the pair get away. They learn the name of the convict who made the music boxes. If the printing plates for 5 were stolen the counterfeits could not be distinguished! [Except for the paper.] Can Sherlock Holmes deduce the secret of the three music boxes? Holmes consults an expert about that tune. Is there some code hidden in those tunes? Will that cigarette stub provide a clue? Or is it a lure to catch Sherlock in a trap? [Note the body double for the strenuous efforts.] Will Hilda fool Dr. Watson? [The same trick from ""A Scandal in Bohemia"".] ""Great Scott!"" Will Sherlock surmise the rest of the message and catch the criminals? Was there another Sherlock Holmes story used for this film, where Sherlock had to trace buyers of a similar object?

In the real world Nazi Germany actually created plates to counterfeit Bank of England 5 notes. Some of this money was used to pay their spies in neutral countries. [""I Was Cicero.""] The Bank of England recalled the old 5 notes to replace them with new money. Inflation has greatly reduced their nominal value. They were worth about $400 then ($25 in silver).",1453334400,,1828,4.667701863354037

Rathbone does a fair amount of unconvincing whistling trying to pin down the meaning of the slightly different music box tunes and Bruce, as usual, dithers too much. The climax/ending is rather abrupt making for a rather sad end for this group of films. Don't get me wrong, this is a serviceable entry, neither lousy or particularly good.

He makes music boxes in prison and hides the secret in three music boxes. The plan is that the confederates would bid on and buy the boxes when they are sold at an auction house. However the confederates arrive late and others buy the boxes. One of the purchasers is a friend of Dr. Watson, who the criminals kill to get his box, and Sherlock Holmes becomes involved.

""You're assuming heaven is his destination?"" -- Hilda Courtney

To most of us on the planet, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are the only Sherlock Homes and Dr. Watson we can accept as the famous duo. This entry in the ""B"" series from Universal is a bit unusual, sort of a hybrid between the two ""A"" pictures made at Fox and the fun ""B"" franchise which came afterward. It retains some of the humor and fun of the latter, but also has a more straightforward story in the Holmes vein, due mostly to it being based on one of Conan Doyle's stories, albeit updated to modern London. Viewers will find amusing Holmes teasing Watson about his latest story, A Scandal in Bohemia appearing in The Strand magazine!

This one starts off with the production of music boxes in prison which find their way to auction. Though plain and ordinary looking, the tune is quite unusual, and apparently of great value. When Watson's old pal Stinky is murdered over the one he purchased, Holmes manages to outwit a formidable foe in the lovely but black hearted Mrs. Courtney (Patricia Morison) and obtains one of the three sold at auction. He discovers a code within the Australian tune and the game is afoot to prevent another murder and financial disaster for England.

Morison was quite lovely and proves a worthy opponent for our favorite Londoner, actually besting him at one point with a cigarette, and nearly disposing of him! Directed by Roy William Neill as usual, fans of the ""B"" films may find this a bit less energetic than some of the others, having more in common in tone with the two made at Fox. It is quite enjoyable, however, and has a terrific line from Watson at its conclusion you will relish.

He remains the consummate screen Holmes, and I still see him in my mind's eye when rereading the stories. He conveys the intense intelligence and laser focus of Sherlock while never hamming it up; I've always felt that Doyle would approve.

Bruce is his usual understated Watson, and the villains are good, specifically the gorgeous Patricia Morrison, a femme fatale if ever there was one. The story is interesting, with enough serpentine workings to keep Holmes fascinated and fascinating. My only qualm is the original print, clearly not archived well, full of scratches and flaws.

309119,3,6301039459,"Basil Rathbone remains one of only two legendary Sherlock Holmes actors, even to this day. But the music-box mystery ""Dressed to Kill"" is not one of the better movies starring Rathbone -- while the mystery is genuinely entertaining, the plot isn't quite long or substantial enough.

Three plain music boxes are sold at an auction, one to Watson's old pal ""Stinky"" (Edmund Breon). The music boxes don't seem to be anything special, which is why Holmes (Basil Rathbone) is intrigued when Stinky is robbed of a similar music box -- and then found with a knife in his back. Obviously there's something special about the boxes.

Holmes and Watson (Nigel Bruce) rush to the next box's owner, and find that the little girl has been robbed by a disguised thief. But Holmes gets his hands on the third box, and learns what the thieves are after, and how the peculiar tune of the music box holds the key to unlimited wealth -- and ruin for England's economic structure.

""Dressed to Kill"" was sadly the last of Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes movies, after thirteen other movies that ranged from Arthur Conan Doyle's own stories to ones made up for World War II. Some of those stories were amazing, and some -- like ""Dressed to Kill's""'s counterfeiting gang story -- are merely middling in quality.

The music box code and the missing five-pound plates make for an interesting mystery, especially for the first half of the movie. The thieves are especially intriguing, including a menacing colonel, a chauffeur madly in love with his employer, and the well-clad Hilda Courtney, who yanks her mink stole out from under a just-murdered man -- and seems more concerned about keeping the stole pristine.

But the plot just isn't enough to cover even a short film (about an hour and even minutes, in case you're wondering), and after the rescue of the little girl, it lags badly. Even more unfortunate, scenes like Holmes' capture don't have much suspense, even though they should.

Rathbone's performance is as solid as ever, giving Holmes elegant intelligence that he doesn't have to work at. He even gets to give Holmes some wistfulness in the opening scenes. And Bruce gives a similarly pleasant performance, although he does have his goofy moments, like doing a Donald Duck impression for a traumatized little girl.

""Dressed to Kill"" is an entertaining mystery, though it's rather slow and simplistic compared to Rathbone's other Sherlock films. But it's still worth watching.",1155081600,,2462,4.932367149758454
309120,4,6301039459,"Until Jeremy Brett put on the deerstalker, Basil Rathbone was considered the one and only Sherlock Holmes, cinematically. His excellent performances make both of these movies -- the mediocre ""Dressed to Kill"" and excellent ""Terror by Night"" -- definite must-sees, even if you have to deal with some crackling.

""Dressed to Kill"" opens with several people bidding on peculiar music boxes, including Watson's pal ""Stinky."" Stinky ends up with a knife in the back and his music box stolen, which Scotland Yard regards as a curiosity -- and Holmes (Rathbone) regards as a dangerous intrigue.

Now they are in a race against time, against a gang of criminals led by a glamourous woman, who are determined to get their hands on every music box. Holmes manages to get his hand on one of them, but he will have to deal with the gang's desperation -- and their secret plot hatched in Dartmoor Prison.

""Terorr By Night"" is somewhat different -- Holmes is hired not to solve a mystery, but to guard the astounding Star of Rhodesia on a train to Edinburgh. Lestrade and Watson are also on board, but all that doesn't stop its owner's son from being murdered, and the jewel (naturally) from being stolen.

Now all three of them -- Holmes, Watson and Lestrade -- begin their own investigations, sometimes with ridiculous results. Holmes quickly unravels a bizarre plot involving the Star, a coffin, a number of unsavory characters... and Professor Moriarty's dastardly sidekick, in disguise.

These movies are not the best of the old Holmes series -- ""Dressed to Kill"" is somewhat simplistic and overly straightforward for a Holmes flick, while ""Terror By Night"" is tighter, tauter and more suspenseful, though also more comic at times. There's also a nice twist at the end, with Lestrade and Holmes in a conspiracy that will fool even viewers.

Basil Rathbone was a really amazing Sherlock, with languid demeanor until he finds a mystery -- then he practically crackles with intelligence. Nigel Bruce makes a lovable if bumbling Watson, trying his hand at investigation (and offending his suspects) and making Donald Duck noises at a crying little girl.

This is one of Diamond Entertainment's less impressive pieces of work, although it's decent enough if you want two classic movies cheaply. The soundtrack has that ""canned"" quality, but is clear except for a bit of crackling (and that pervasive train noise in ""Terror""). The picture wobbles a bit and is somewhat blurred by age, though ""Terror by Night"" is substantially clearer than ""Dressed to Kill.""

While the prints of this are merely decent, the two Holmes movies on here are still worth watching, if nothing else for Rathbone's wonderful performances.",1154476800,2,2700,4.997772828507795

309123,5,6301039459,"When I was about 10 I got really into the Sherlock Holmes/Dr. Watson stories. I can remember talking about them with my grandmother who used to tell me that she loved the Basil Rathbone Holmes movies. This was back before VCRs and DVD players so at the time there was no way for me to be able to see the movies themselve, so I had to take her word for it.

Still, those conversations stuck in the back of my mind, so when I saw this movie for sale I decided to order it, if for no other reason out of respect for my grandmother.

I'm glad I did. This is one of the better Sherlock Holmes stories, involving the elusive Professor Moriorty, a baffled Dr. Watson and Holmes acting as mysterious as ever - yet figuring it all out in the end.

309125,5,6301039459,"The Basil Rathbone - Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes films were moved from Victorian England to WWII England.

If you are looking for faithful adaptation of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle books then get the Jeremy Brett Mystery series.  If you are looking for some great acting and good period mysteries, the Rathbone - Bruce series is great.

A murder occurs but the only thing missing is a music box.  Not a valuable or unique music box but an ordinary plain music box.  Holmes is able to acquire two similar music boxes and finds that the songs are the same but not.  But without the other two boxes, he cannot solve the mystery.  The bounty is the location of stolen Bank of England engraving plates.  This is one of the best (and the final) of the series and features Patricia Morrison as the seductive Hilda Courtney.

The transfer quality is fairly poor but not awful.  These are the kind of films that are not usually subject to restoration and the deteriorated status is that of wear and age.  I have seen a new collection but they are quite expensive.  So if you just want to have a copy of the films just to enjoy these mysteries, these are fine.

Of course, for most Basil was Sherlock Holmes, this was probably the first films that he had a chance to a role that he could use his substantial talent.  Before these, he was usually the bad guy or a minor supporting player.  He was an accomplished swordsman and the joke was he constantly had to lose to actors that he could beat blindfolded.

The film has a few weaknesses, but it does place the art of deduction on a pedestal above and beyond the action, and that is just what I want out of a Sherlock Holmes film. Needless to say, the plot is not based on any work of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but it does try to place itself within the milieu of the canon. Early on, we see Dr. Watson perusing the latest issue of The Strand; A Scandal in Bohemia has just been published, and this leads to a few comments on ""the woman,"" Irene Adler. This sets up the new case in hand, one in which Holmes finds himself greatly tested by yet another woman. Hilda Courtney (Patricia Morrison) is no Irene Adler, but she is devilishly clever enough to pose quite an interesting and dangerous challenge to the great detective.

Like many of the classic Holmes stories, this adventure starts with a common object - a music box. One of Watson's old friends stops by and describes the theft of one of the plainest music boxes in his collection the night before. Thinking it odd that a thief would steal only a seemingly insignificant piece of the collection, Holmes sets his mind to looking for an explanation more complicated than any petty thief theory. He soon finds himself on a search for three music boxes, each of which plays the same tune (but with minor differences). The ultimate quarry is a set of stolen plates from the Bank of England. Convinced that the music boxes contain some type of code pointing to the location of the plates, Holmes is hard pressed to figure out the secret of the boxes. His foe is a clever one; not only is she capable of playing Watson for a fool, she is clever enough to outmaneuver Holmes himself.

A needlessly elaborate method of disposing once and for all of the meddling detective definitely weakens the effectiveness of this story, but all in all I found this a perfectly enjoyable Holmesian adventure. Watching Holmes try to figure out the secret of the music boxes calls to mind the spirit of Holmes' original adventures and showcases the detective doing what he does best.

Terror By Night offers a nice change of pace in the old Sherlock Holmes series of films starring Basil Rathbone as the great detective. The action takes place completely outside the confines of London and 221B Baker Street, centering on a train ride from London to Edinburgh. Holmes has been hired to safeguard an ill-fated diamond called the Star of Rhodesia on Lady Margaret Carstairs' trip home, but he's not alone. Good old Inspector Lestrade is also onboard, posing as a fisherman on holiday. Despite the presence of Holmes, Watson, and Lestrade, though, Lady Margaret's son is murdered and the jewel stolen. The jewel must be in one of the compartments onboard the train, and Lestrade quickly takes over the questioning and searching of the passengers. Dr. Watson - God bless him - also attempts his own investigation, which bears only ignominious - and comical - results.

There are a number of real characters onboard the train, each one of them suspicious in some way or other. There's a rather impertinent young lady accompanying her mother's coffin, a most disagreeable professor, an older couple concerned about the police presence around them, Watson's old friend Major Duncan-Bleek, as well as several train employees. The fact that we the viewers are kept unaware of the culprit's identity until the end is a definite plus - as is the fact that the guilty party turns out to be a jewel thief of much renown. There's as much light comedy as there is drama until the endgame is set in motion, and the ending offers a surprise or two that rescues the film from the realm of the merely average. Terror By Night is not the best of the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes films, but it's certainly an entertaining, reasonably compelling entry in the series.",1127692800,,4020,4.673728813559322

(This review is for the DVD version of this movie by ""FOCUSfilm"" entertainment and released July 2001.)

This movie is, according to the opening credits, adapted from a story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930).  This was the last movie in which Basil Rathbone played Sherlock Holmes.  (This was also the first time I saw Rathbone play Holmes.)

This movie is concerned with stolen counterfeit Bank of England money plates.  Of all things, cheap, identical music boxes that play an old Australian song and that were made in prison by the same inmate seem to hold the key to the plates' hidden location.  Also interested in these music boxes are three of this inmate's partners in crime: Mrs. Hilda Courtney (Patricia Morison), Colonel Cavanaugh (Fred Worlock), and Cavanaugh's driver Hamid Yard (Harry Cording).

When murders start occurring, Scotland Yard is called in to investigate.  As well, the super-sleuth along with his trusty sidekick Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) helps with the investigation.  An attempted murder also occurs.

My favorite quotation said by Sherlock in this movie:

""The truth can only be found by the painstaking elimination of the untrue.""

Basil Rathbone captures the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance.  Nigel Bruce as his bumbling aid also gives a superb and, to me, an unforgettable performance.  Also, look for the fine performance of Patricia Morrison as the ""femme fatales.""

This movie is like a time capsule of 1940's London.  As well, the background music adds to each scene.

The DVD picture quality is practically perfect.  There are no distracting artifacts.  However, voices at the beginning of this movie are a bit muffled but this gets better as the movie progresses.

Finally extras include a theatrical trailer, still gallery, and seven original radio broadcasts of  ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" (3  hours) starring Rathbone and Bruce.  I found these interesting.

In conclusion, this is a fun movie that I feel serves as an excellent introduction to Basil Rathbone portraying Sherlock Holmes!!

(1946; 70 min; 12 scenes;  black and white; full screen)

The final entry in the beloved Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes series relies less on plotting than it does on the expert characterizations of the two leading actors and their onscreen rapport.  The mystery is rather simplistic and not particularly compelling: a prison inmate jailed for the theft of Bank of England printing plates has sent out coded clues divulging the location of the hidden plates in three music boxes he has manufactured while in stir.  The boxes, intended for his gang, end up in the hands of innocent citizens by mistake.  Holmes and Watson become involved in a deadly race to collect the three boxes, crack the code, and find the plates before the prisoner's band of cronies beat them to it.

In their fourteenth outing, the characters of the master sleuth and his sidekick fit Rathbone and Bruce like old, comfortable shoes that are beginning to show their wear.  As their deadly adversaries, Patricia Morison, Frederic Worlock, and Harry Cording (remember him as the burly, mute servant in the 1934 film ""The Black Cat""?) make an interesting - if unmysterious -  trio.  The film's name is taken from Morison's character, who has a penchant for dressing to the nines when she's not wearing some sort of disguise.  In one scene, a fresh body falls on top of her floor-length white mink, and as she disdainfully pulls the fur out from under the unfortunate victim, she gives the distinct impression of being more worried about her outfit than she is the warm corpse!

The MPI video release features a generally commendable transfer from a 35mm print digitally restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.  Certainly this is the best edition of the film ever made available on home video; ever since its copyright fell into the public domain, ""Dressed to Kill"" has been released by second-tier video companies in an unending parade of almost unwatchable washed out and scratchy prints, often plagued by muddy audio.  Here, although a couple of scenes briefly appear slightly out-of-focus or overly grainy, the majority of the transfer is sharp and clear in terms of both the video and audio quality.  While not the best of the series, the MPI release is nonetheless recommended as a pleasant way to spend 72 minutes, and is definitely the edition to purchase if you plan on adding this title to your home video library.",1112400000,6,2415,4.889705882352941

The plot revolves around music boxes but the plot has nothing to do with the title. On the cover of my budget Sherlock Holmes double-feature for $5.95, you see a great poster of Patricia Morrison, clad in furs and silks, with a gun ready to fire.

Even 35 years before Brian DePalma's thriller of the same name, the title wasn't original, having been previously used for one of Lloyd Nolan's Michael Shayne private detective thrillers. There isn't much original about this entry, but even if it's a fairly standard series episode, it still has the always superb Rathbone and Bruce to recommend it, as well as a satisfying mystery for the two to unravel.
Although Rathbone left the series after this film and moved on to Broadway where he won a Tony Award, he didn't succeed in escaping Holmes, and would wear the deerstalker again on stage and in an unsold pilot for a TV series. He remains the definitive Sherlock Holmes.
