8130550,5,B000GBYI0G,"A great little book to read about the people of the town of Gettysburg, who were all minding their own business when the decisive battle of the Civil War exploded around them.  Stories of who they were, what they did,  how some helped, where they lived.  You can then drive to where they lived and imagine what it must have been like for them.  Definately more interesting than the stupid ghost tours.......read what actually happened, instead of made up drivel.  So very interesting!",1359331200,,484,4.783132530120482
