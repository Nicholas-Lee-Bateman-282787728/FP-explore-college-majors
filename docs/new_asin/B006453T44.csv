Also, there was nothing but voice over and words on the screen, which is about as boring as you can get.  It would have been a far better buy had there been video of them working with consultation birds or other birds with problems.  I wouldn't buy anything else from them, personally.  It's all perfect world advice for people who have nothing else in their lives but their birds.  It's not for the real world.",1529971200,,495,4.326086956521739
