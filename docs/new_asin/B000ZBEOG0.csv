3038975,4,B000ZBEOG0,"I liked this movie when I saw it on TV - and I have seen it twice. It was good but could have been better. At times it seemed disjointed, but at other times was truly moving. In some ways it just seemed unfinished. It is a good story though and I recommend it but do not set your expectations too high.",1208649600,4,302,3.8870967741935485
3038976,4,B000ZBEOG0,"I too saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel.  It was recommended by a friend of mine who had a transplant 10 years ago.  I also have a daughter who had a bone marrow and kidney transplant, 19 yrs and 3 years ago. This movie brought back memories I had forgotten.  The feelings of helplessness, of living in hospitals, seeing other patients pass away, withdrawing from life ... so many conflicting emotions.  I felt it was an accurate portrayal of what a person experiences.  The characters could have been more developed and some of the details seemed a little bit stretched, but still believable.  It is a heart-warming story and makes you want to truly treasure your health and the blessings you've been given.",1205452800,18,713,4.709677419354839
3038977,4,B000ZBEOG0,"I loved this movie.  I recently saw it on the Hallmark Channel and found it heartwarming and sweet to see the transformation these characters underwent.  It could have used a little more explanation in areas of the characters lives before their transplant, but the ending left me smiling and I love that.",1201737600,9,304,4.826923076923077

3039003,5,B000ZBEOG0,I really enjoyed the twists and turns of this show.  I'm an organ donor and it does me good to see how those choices can benefit others.  The show made me laugh and cry but I will watch it again and again over the years.  Thank you.,1391904000,,232,3.893617021276596
3039004,5,B000ZBEOG0,Great movie. And such a great story. Highly recommend. Although a great movie for the family some parts are probably had to understand for children.,1375747200,,148,4.96
3039005,4,B000ZBEOG0,"3.5 staring Samantha Mathis as Callie Morgan and Peter Dobson as Jasper Cates.

This is a Hallmark typical chick flick movie. Callie and Jasper have heart tranplants. Their heart donors were Sarah ""Cricket"" Cummings's parents. Callie and Jasper's romance is typical. What's bizarre, is the way these heart transplant people feel so very connected to their donors. I don't know if that's true. But the way they acted towards their donors was like a stalkers. I liked this for Samantha Mathis. She did a pretty good job in being a skeptic and emotionally distant person. Peter comes across as someone who should be an extra in the movies Greece. I did a search on what other acting he's done. Ironically, he's performed as Elvis in Forest Gump and Protecting the King (2007).

The movie is still a good chick flick movie to watch on tv. I've seen it about three times now.",1373760000,,870,4.717105263157895
3039006,5,B000ZBEOG0,Sometimes Hallmark Channel movies are odd (odd like most Lifetime movies are). This movie is a romantic comedy which deals with the issue of organ donor/recipients and has moments of dark comedy among a group of patients waiting for their name to come up on 'the list' for transplant. The main story line however is the issue of whether or not organ-memory exists.  On recipient gets cravings for foods she never liked but the donor did. The two main characters receive the hearts of a husband and wife and are both drawn to the surviving daughter. It is an interesting movie with a happy ending (unlike most Lifetime movies). I bought this DVD after seeing the movie a few times. I can watch this movies several times a year. It's a feel good movie,1366156800,2,749,4.58955223880597
3039007,5,B000ZBEOG0,I enjoyed the movie.  It had a heart-warming storyline.  There were no problems with any of the functions or menus within this product.  It has excelllent picture and sound qualtities.,1324857600,,184,5.066666666666666

3039030,2,B000ZBEOG0,"Sorry, but couldn't connect with the male lead, he was jerky.  And the time they spent watching the little girl bordered on stalking.  I know they were trying to create a connection, but found this extremely creepy. Just my humble opinion.",1294617600,,239,4.804878048780488
3039031,5,B000ZBEOG0,"Despite a couple of tragic moments, this is a feel-good movie. It is human nature to root for what is ""meant to be,"" and this movie allows you to do that without disappointment.

While some consider it to be far-fetched for two people who receive transplants from a husband and wife to fall in love and eventually connect with the deceased couple's orphan, such emotional changes and attractions do happen in transplant patients. Despite the fact that - in typical Hallmark fashion - you can predict at the beginning who is going to fall in love with whom, and that the little girl is going to eventually be in the mix, this is a very enjoyable movie to watch.

Everyone in my crowd enjoyed the movie, and one wants to watch it again.",1290729600,,734,4.511278195488722
