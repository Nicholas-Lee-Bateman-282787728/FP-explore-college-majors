I used this DVD every year with my high school English seniors when I'd introduce a Shakespeare unit (although I'm certain you could use it with younger ages - a coworker borrowed it for her sophomores). This is my 2nd video by Engel that I've used in the classroom and purchased myself. To be warned, he speaks quite a lot about Shakespeare but he focuses more on the time period and what it was like to go to a play. It's fabulous and I never have to worry about the kids losing interest. It's nice because there are already dozens if not hundreds of great media about Shakespeare out there, and this doesn't repeat anything that's out there because he shows the kids how to look at his works from a new angle. I'm a huge fan. Also check out A Light History of the English Language (link above) if you teach British Lit. Excellent explanation of how English evolved from Anglo Saxon German and French.",1380585600,3,1133,5.370786516853933
8224091,1,B000WMEAUC,"Never have I been so disappointed with an educational video the way I have with this one.  Honestly, if you have any knowledge about Shakespeare do NOT buy this.  It is simply a man standing in front of a fireplace repeating tidbits about Shakespeare that is common knowledge for most English teachers, though what takes him an hour to tell would take the average person 20 minutes.  Engel is a far cry from the reviews you will find on the back of his DVD.  I was more annoyed by the end of it than enlightened and refuse to show this to my students because I think of it more as a punishment.  All I wanted was a good intro to Shakespeare and instead I wasted about $20.",1267574400,2,672,4.25984251968504
8224092,3,B000WMEAUC,"Professor Engel's ""William Shakespeare: A Light and Enlightening Look"" is not actually about William Shakespeare, specifically (as in, biographical information) but about the theater during Shakespeare's day. If you are looking for a good documentary about Shakespeare's life, look elsewhere.

However, if you are interesting in teaching the context of Shakespeare's plays, this is a good start. Engel is entertaining, despite his tendency to go off on tangents. Then again, don't most students enjoy the teacher who goes on tangents? He gives a lecture about attending the theater in Shakespeare's day, and gives an interesting picture of what it might be like.

He isn't totally accurate about everything; for example, he supports the theory that the groundlings were so stupid that they drooled on stage (thus the origin of ""break a leg""), making it sound like the groundlings were almost sub-humans who dumbly came to the theater, only appeased by blood and sorcerers. Sure, they weren't as well-educated, or even as bright, as the upper-classes sitting in the seats, but were they so stupid they drooled? A bit insulting, especially for anyone who descends from hearty English peasant stock!

So, if you buy this, your students will find Engel amusing (perhaps not for the reasons HE intends) but make sure you set the facts straight!",1264636800,2,1339,5.21860465116279
8224093,4,B000WMEAUC,"This is by far one of the best resources I have found that explains not only what it was like to live during Shakepeare's time but also what it was like to work or go to the theater.  Elliot Engel gives startling information about the origins of ""the box office"", ""meat pies"", ""break a leg"" and yes, even ""Ketchup"".  My Middle School students find it facinating.",1231804800,3,362,4.46969696969697
