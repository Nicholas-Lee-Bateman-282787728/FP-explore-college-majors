(1.) Another made for TV movie then following that failure was made into a DVD to recover costs.
(2.) Another forensics detective TV movie.
(3.) Another crooked politicians with a DA or some other lower level political personage vying for higher office - guv'nor no less.
(4.) Another detective chasing female coworkers and vice versa.
(5.) Another detective chasing misdirected leads resulting in unexpected (well, suppose to be but pretty obvious) suspicions and the usual plot twists.
(6.) Another unsolved long ago murders with ties to 3, 4, 5 above.

To all the above add juvenile dialogue; bland, read a single line of script acting, then cut, edit and shoot the next line, over and over; minimal expenditures for props and the settings consisted of a lab, a car, a room and lots of overhead prolonged helicopter views of a city. Very creative.

Storyline was either poorly written and/or scripted to be totally disjointed or the editing resulted in a lot of scenes being poorly spliced together.",1314662400,,1060,5.017045454545454
4156575,1,B003N9ASG6,"""At Risk"" is a Lifetime Channel movie so the bar was set pretty low at the get go.  Anyone who has ever seen a Lifetime Channel movie will understand this. Daniel Sunjata does a commendable job with the material he has to work with. Andie McDowell delivers an over the top performance but she is so darn gorgeous she can get away with it.  Gish is a good actress and she pretty much carries the movie since she is the only character who actually does any criminal investigating and detective work. ""At Risk"" is classified as a ""thriller"" but that's a definite over-statement.  It's the type of film Meemaw and Peepaw would be comfortable viewing.  If you are a fan of McDowell like I am you will also enjoy it (just so you can bask in her beauty and that cute accent of hers.)  Overall it's kind of a snoozefest.  Catch it on tv first if you can then if you want invest in the dvd.",1311033600,,881,4.27710843373494
4156576,1,B003N9ASG6,"Being a huge fan, I was keen to watch this film but it took only minutes for bitter disappointment. It's like a 1970's badly made film with piano music played heavily over the scenes and sound quality was horrible.  I thought it was  a very weak plot only made worse by the terrible acting from the main characters.
So disappointing.",1297123200,,333,4.533333333333333
4156577,3,B003N9ASG6,"At Risk isn't a theater-quality film, but it's slightly better than most made for TV movies thanks to the cinematography and cast.

The film was shot very well by veteran TV director Tom McLoughlin, and uses a quality score by composer Christopher Ward. I was also pleased by the interesting color effects used for most of the crime-related flashback scenes. But what really stands out about this film is the cast. Andie MacDowell (Groundhog day) portrays an overly ambitious District Attorney in Boston, though she oddly didn't shake her South Carolina accent for the role. The ladies seem to love Daniel Sunjata (Rescue Me), and the rest of the cast is rounded out by experienced TV actors.

Where the movie falls short is the story, which jumps around a bit too much. The dialogue isn't especially interesting, and there isn't much character development. There's an attempt at a backstory involving the Sunjata character's grandmother, though it doesn't add to the film. One flashback involving pennies grabbed my attention, as some New Orleanians like myself will catch the obscure voodoo reference. But how that ties in with her adoration of Geronimo, or her grandson's investigative work, isn't at all clear. It also bugged me that the Canadian costume designer had a Boston Hispanic dress as only a California cholo would.

There are some emotional moments in the film, but not enough to elevate it beyond your average drama. I haven't read the Patricia Cornwell novel, but the consensus on Amazon is that it's not one of her best books. Overall I thought this was a decent TV movie, though you should probably watch it once before you decide to buy the DVD.",1275350400,2,1665,4.918149466192171

8400779,1,B003N9ASG6,"From the geniuses at Lifetime:

This is a movie about Andie MacDowell as a high-power Boston DA... because when I think powerful DA, lord knows I think Andie MacDowell... and when I hear her Texas twang, lord knows I think Boston! Daniel Sinjata co-stars as an Apache (I'm not kidding) named Win (nope, not kidding). His grandmother is played by Diahann Carroll (still not kidding) who practices voodoo (lord how I wish I was kidding) and throws pennies at a Jamaican so he'll be scared and give her his dogs (totally not kidding).

Annabeth Gish plays the role of Sigourney Weaver***, who is in love with Win, and mopes around Knoxville, where no one (including Sigourney Weaver) sound like they're from Tennessee. Sigourney Weaver (played by Annabeth Gish)  is trying to help solve a 35 year-old Tennessee murder that the Boston DA ordered Win to handle, because Boston and Knoxville are the same thing with no jurisdictional conflicts whatsoever.

[Did I mention that Win lives in a high school? It made no difference to the plot, but they made a big point about the fact that Win Lives In A High School. I guess that's Patricia Cornwell's idea of ""hip"" and ""edgy"".]

So at some point Andie MacDowell tries her hand at speaking French and sounds like a simple-minded Cajun. It was important for the writers to establish that her father is French and she can speak the language. No, it doesn't advance the plot. But I don't think these writers cared so much about plot. Meanwhile, Win has a touching encounter in the park with the step-father of a boy who is interning for the DA. He has a distinct Canadian accent. Did I mention this takes place in Boston?  This is actually the crux of the plot-such-as-it-is, this man and his step-son and why the DA is looking into a murder in a whole other state, but we spend very little time with it until the end, when we are suddenly treated to a series of monologues and cheesy flashback sequences that narrate what the detectives should have been discovering as the plot advanced. But who had time for the plot when Sigourney Weaver was moping, Win stood a woman up for dinner, Win's grandma rescued a dog, Win's grandma made a speech about Geronimo, and did I mention that Andie MacDowell was almost burned alive by a drug offender who got off and came at her for revenge? Win saved her by firing multiple bullets at the guy holding the lit matches, because everyone knows that's how you stop someone from dropping a match on gasoline - you riddle them with bullets and hope their hand doesn't slip. Win The Apache, Ace Rescuer.

I would give this zero stars, but the one, lone star is a tribute to the uncredited canine thespian who played the role of Miss Dog. One lone star for the one lone actor who didn't embarrass herself.

Verdict: do not, under any circumstances, encourage these people by paying money for the DVD. Watch it for free on Lifetime, if you absolutely must, but for god's sake don't enable the crazy by putting cash in their pockets. The entire Apache Nation thanks you.

***it's possible that Annabeth Gish was playing another character and merely made up to look the spitting image of Sigourney Weaver circa Gorillas In The Mist, but with this movie who knows",1380412800,,3230,4.642732049036778
