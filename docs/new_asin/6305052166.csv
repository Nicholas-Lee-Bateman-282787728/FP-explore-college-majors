8187978,4,6305052166,"If you want to watch a movie and see how to be ""cool"" under intense situations...then you must watch this movie and take lots of notes.  You will see Chow Yun-Fat reprise his role as ""The God Of  Gamblers"" and you will wonder how can one actor be soooooooooo cool  (especially the scene when he  encounters the person that killed his wife).  Ng Sin Lin is so pretty even though she plays a common looking female in  it.  Chingmy Yau is fine as always...especially with all the plastic  surgery she's had.  Whatever you do...avoid the other God Of Gamblers  movies (the one without Chow Yun-Fat)...those movies suck.  But what makes  the movie is Chow Yun-Fat.  One quote says it all, ""Chow Yun-Fat is  the coolest actor in the world.""",924652800,,734,4.589147286821706
