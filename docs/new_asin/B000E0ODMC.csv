2476989,5,B000E0ODMC,Watched this over & over. The one dvd gets stuck & I have to fast forward a bit but they are very good shows.,1355270400,,109,3.5833333333333335
2476990,5,B000E0ODMC,"This is a great show. There was a lot more guest acts on this volume than on volume one.
Ep. 1 Polly Bergen, Bob Fosse and Mary Ann Niles. The skit where Dean takes a date to the movies is hilarious. Also when they are trying to sleep at the motel (I loved Jerry's suit) is great. When Dean puts the toothpaste on the hairbrush then Jerry brushes his hair so funny.

Ep. 2 Connie Russell, Ray Malone, Danny Arnold & Ira Grassel and Bernie Schwartz and Peppy Willow. The valet skit was funny I love when Jerry talks to the audience. Then when the press is at the plane and they say here comes Martin & Lewis and it is Tony Martin and Joe Lewis. When Jerry is punching the champ Joe Lewis until Joe pops him one. I couldn't stop laughing. The ending song is great.

Ep. 3 Dorothy Dandridge, Danny Arnold, Bob and Eddie Mayo, Donald MacBride and Marion Marshall. The skit where Dean is acting like he is a ventriliquist and Jerry is the dummy is great. I loved the prison skit when Jerry gets in the top bunk and it slowly falls down. The funniest part is when Dean and Jerry are singing and conducting the band when Jerry cries and hugs Dean. Then Dean licks the side of Jerry's face. I could believe it. Dean is so funny.

Ep. 4 Helen O'Connell, Fosse & Niles and Ladd Lyon. Jerry is great when he is messing with the cameras and they can't keep up with him. The golf skit is very amusing. I love when Dean is going to hit the ball out of Jerry's mouth. The Library part is so good. I love how Dean is wearing glasses.

This whole disc is great. The DVD arrived on time and in perfect condition.",1344470400,8,1594,4.165584415584416

2476992,5,B000E0ODMC,I received this video over a year ago.  It has been such an enjoyable and laughable comedy video that all ages can watch. clean slapstick. They don't make them like this anymore.,1255737600,10,178,4.5625
2477032,5,B000E0ODMC,Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin were an amazing team. This is a good buy if you are a fan or if you are just into laughing :),1424736000,,121,3.5185185185185186

2477036,5,B000E0ODMC,"I love these guys, great sketches made better by either Jerry or Dean forgetting their lines. This type of humour appeals to young and old alike  no violence or bad language which just goes to show you don't need to resort to those measures to get first class entertainment. A must if you are a Lewis and Martin fan",1410825600,,315,4.338983050847458
2477037,3,B000E0ODMC,"Hard sometimes to make out what they are saying. Some of the acting is over the top, just as I remembered, but both could act in serious roles. One can tell this even with all the nonsense. I like both the guys, and these shows were so long ago, what can one expect?",1407715200,,266,4.037735849056604

2477039,5,B000E0ODMC,Good old fashioned entertainment. It is just like going back into time and watching on one of the original TV sets.,1406246400,,115,4.523809523809524
2477040,5,B000E0ODMC,Hilarious comedy like you don't see anymore. Brought back so many great memories of their incomparable chemistry. Laughed our heads off. Buy it and enjoy.,1357776000,,154,5.2
2477041,3,B000E0ODMC,"If your a Dean and Jerry/early TV fan, as I am, you will see beyond the dated vaudville entertainment and grainy kinescope quality and enjoy this. Just for a chance to peer into what the early days of live TV was like makes it worth it. It's also fun to get a taste of what Dean and Jerry's stage act was like.",1356652800,,310,4.016129032258065

8103462,2,B000E0ODMC,"This DVD was a huge disappointment. The quality of the video is somewhat akin to dubbing from VCR to VCR on extended play. I was looking for something from the days when Jerry Lewis was still funny, now I'm just as bitter as he's become. (Just kidding, but this DVD sucks. ave your money.)",1483228800,,289,4.37037037037037
