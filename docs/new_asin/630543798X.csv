The hachet people edited out everything above the knee and below the neck. If you are looking for the unrated version, keep looking, because folks, this ain't it. I am still searching for the unrated movie, which doesn't seem to exist anywhere on the internet for sale.",1280275200,3,436,4.675324675324675
1022503,2,630543798X,"This is the saga of two women, friends, who find themselves sexually frustrated because their husbands are married to their work. Grace (Amy Lindsay) and her good friend Jenifer (Kim Yates) and their spouses are on some kind of vacation together or maybe their husbands are attending a work related convention. In any case, they are staying at a hotel somewhere in the west and are bored silly.

Realizing this, Grace's husband Ray (Jim Stevens) arranges for her and Jenifer to visit a restored, old west ghost town. At the ghost town Grace and Jenifer begin to explore their setting when their new settings. Eventually the come across an antique mirror in a storeroom of the saloon. When Grace tries to touch the mirror, her hand penetrates it, so of course, being world class explorers, they decide to go through the mirror.

On the other side of the mirror, they are still in the Saloon, but it is now in the eighteen hundreds. To make a long story short, The Madame of the saloon thinks Grace and Jenifer are two hostess/prostitutes she had sent for and puts them to work. In the meantime, Jenifer's Husband appears as Sheriff Bart (Nicolas Yff) and Grace's husband is now Reverend Issac. Much to the annoyance of his girl friend, Evie, Sheriff Bart takes a shine to Jenifer and she sets Jenifer up for the murder of the sheriff's deputy. After a very speedy kangaroo court, Jenifer is sentenced to hang in the morning.

In the meantime, after a couple rolls with the customer's, Reverend Issac is trying to save Grace's soul, while she is trying to seduce him. Grace wins, but she has to save her friend from the hangman. Together they escape and retrace their steps though the magic mirror back into the twenty-first century and their now attentive modern day husbands.

Conclusion

Timegate: Tales of the Saddletramps is not quite awful but I certainly wouldn't have missed anything had I not seen it. The Plot/story was contrived, silly, hokey and frankly not very well presented. In the scene where the girls go back in time by going through an antique mirror, the special effects were so poor that you could tell they were walking beside instead of through the mirror.

For a low budget softcore movie the cast, acting and sets weren't too bad but the weakness of the screenplay and directing by Sam Silver, trumped everything else.

The nudity was full but not explicit. There were about eight sex scenes of varying intensity and creativity, none of which came close to being exceptional. None looked authentic, though a couple with Kim Yates, in my opinion, did feel sensual. Kim has a very nice body and was the best performer in the film, though not enough to raise my rating above 2  stars.",1152403200,15,2839,4.682092555331992

In short this is the only reason to buy this movie as far as I am concerned.",1140652800,4,160,3.8484848484848486
1022505,4,630543798X,"I am a western buff by choice so when this came out I thought it

worth a look and found it very interesting. Nice twist on the old west. It lack some western authenticity but the nudity and sex made up for it...",1126569600,5,212,3.9302325581395348
1022506,5,630543798X,"When I saw that Kim Yates was listed on the credits, I didn't hesitate! Immediately ordered the DVD Timegate!  When I first played it, noticed that Amy Lindsay was listed as the star.  Definitely a big bonus.  So far as I am concerned, both these ladies are Super Stars.  I like their looks and their acting.  Can't complain about any of the other ladies in the cast, they were all nice to look at and I enjoyed watching them.

The premise of time-travel was simply done.  I think the story line was good, it played smoothly and it EASILY kept my attention, all the way to the end.  BUT, remember, it IS a ""soft"" porn show and Unfortunately, ""soft"" is the key word here.  Even though, I really enjoyed watching it, and I was pleasantly entertained, I was also very disappointed.

It did not serve my needs.  [:-(  Bummer.",1124928000,20,821,4.436241610738255
1022507,4,630543798X,"In this early Surrender Cinema softcore offering, Kim Yates and Amy Lindsay get transported back to the old west. They become prostitutes, have sex with a priest, get thrown in jail, and escape. None of those things are actually related though.

There are seven sex scenes. Six are boy/girl and one is boy/girl/girl. All of them are good. I thought the two scenes with Kim were the best. In addition to Kim and Amy, we also get an eyeful of Amber Newman, Shannon Malone, and Taimie Hannum. Since this is a Surrender release, the only thing you hear during the sex scenes is music. The sex isn't as hot as some of Surrender's better releases, but it's much better than their worst ones.

This is a Koch release, so I want to point out that it really does contain the unrated version and not a cut up, R rated version.

This isn't a must have, but for its price, it delivers quite a bit, so I recommend it.",1098662400,34,904,4.369047619047619

It looks like it was shot on a department store camera as opposed to an even semi-professional piece of equipment.

7888975,2,630543798X,"A decent story, but... The women are decent looking, and you see a lot of breasts (you didn't rent this for intellectual reasons). But the sex is just boring, the guys just lay there or sit there, the women look completely uninterested and seem to be posing for a 60s men's magazine. And why is it that makers of american soft-porn have no idea where human genitals are, the fake sex here looks faker than it actually is. Tongues don't touch other tongues or nipples, as a matter of fact I noticed that tongues don't even come out when they are supposedly passionatley kissing. And no one seems the least bit interested in or excited iabout the sex they are allegedly having. The acting isn't that bad or that good, the sets are cheap, the costumes are ok, but this is a Full Moon movie after all you can't expect too much.",1483056000,,823,4.421052631578948

7888982,3,630543798X,"This movie isn't something you'd see in a theater, so don't expect it to be all that amazing.

A couple of women get transported back in time to the ""Wild West"" and a case of mistaken identity causes them to get mixed up in a crime. Now they have to stay out of jail and get back to their own time.
During all this there's lots of nudity and sex.

The acting is bland, the sex isn't that incredible and the plot is ""ho hum"".
The women are attractive, so that's a bonus.

It's not a horrible movie, I've certainly seen worse, but it's about what you'd expect for a ""direct-to-video"" soft-core porn-type of flick.",1290297600,,611,4.2956521739130435
