8027004,2,B0002DVA6S,"This film features Lenny Magill, John Pride and Mickey Fowler shooting at moving targets, and shooting stationary targets from a moving vehicle. At the beginning, Magill tells that he was interested to see, how easy it really is to hit a moving target, compared to the picture you get from the movies. I was relieved that he did not give a lame excuse for assuring that this is a vital skill for anyone who carries a gun for self defense.

Most of the film consist of Pride and Fowler shooting to a target that is towed with an automobile at various speeds. After each run, they comment on the hits, and try to estimate how big a lead s hooter should take at given speed and distance. At the end, they also shoot from moving car to a stationary target. The result is that it is surprisingly hard to hit a moving target, even if it moves at steady pace.

The film is surprisingly interesting, although it could have been a bit shorter. Had they edited unnecessary sequences off form the film, the result would have been a better. The production of the film is good and they use two cameras to shoot the film (one behind the shooter and one near the target). Although the film is somewhat interesting to watch, it is of little use to just about anyone. Therefore, it is a bit hard to recommend it to anyone.
