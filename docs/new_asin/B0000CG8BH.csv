7999237,4,B0000CG8BH,"DD and the girls have new help against the Maguar as Oldeena, another alien police officer arrives on the scene. Unlike DD she scorns the help of Figure 17, and believes she can take care of the bug hunt on her own. Boy, is she wrong, because the Maguar have mutated due to the alien environment of Earth, and their weapons no longer hurt them. In much the same way Hikaru's abilities when merged with Tsubasa increase and are the only sure bet to destroy the Maguar. There's very little battle time in this second volume, and that's a good thing. There's really nothing special in the combat part of this anime. It's in the time spent on Tsubasa and Hikaru that the real heart of the show lies. In the first episode, the girls have an overnight camp sleep-out on the grounds of their school, and Tsubasa gets a little more interaction with her crush. In the second episode, the girls have to help out their aunt after an illness prevents her from helping out on the farm. Their auntie's real problem may be with her daughter Sakura's failure to help her and overall disregard for the work that her family does.

I love the characters of Tsubasa and Hikaru because they are so sweet and good-natured. There really isn't a Heart of Darkness here. The director of the show even says there is nothing complicated here, and that he just wants you to enjoy the show.

His mission has been accomplished! The animation is film quality and it really shows in the two leads facial expressions and movement. While some may find the story overly cute I like it. Great characters! There are about 25 minutes of extras about the making of the show and a promotional video.",1122336000,,1659,4.526666666666666
7999238,4,B0000CG8BH,"I rated the first volume of this series a ""5.""  This volume is not quite as good as the first, but there is still a certain magic permeating the episodes.  If what I have seen in these first two volumes is any indication, I think that the entire series will earn a collective five stars.
I encourage you to watch this series.  It is . . . well, ""charming"" comes to mind.",1079568000,2,370,4.111111111111111
7999239,4,B0000CG8BH,"In these two episodes, another character is introduced, another alien who has come to give assistance to DD in destryoing the rest of the Maguar.  She's somewhat brash, a bit arrogant, sure of herself, seems to have a somewhat love-hate relationship with DD and doesn't seem to care to like Figures much at all.  In fact, she wants to finish off the Maguar on her own without having to resort to becoming a Figure or having Figure 17 help in the fight.
  Tsubasa and Hikaru are involved in a few minor battles in these two episodes, but the majority of the time is devoted to further character development.  We spend a lot of time with the two girls and their friends as they have a camp out at the school, where they cook curry and investigate the school in the dark.  The second episode is mostly about life on the farm as the two girls help out with chores when the farm owners wife gets sick.
  These episdoes are slow paced and might not appeal to someone who only likes action, but I found them a nice change of pace from some of the more frenetic shows out there.  It's nice to be able to sit back and watch the characters grow and blossom as Tsubasa is drawn more out of her shell by the more outgoing Hikaru.
  Also, we're introduced to a reporter in these episodes who seems to notice that there are unusual things going on in the vicinity, what with all the battles that have been going on with the Maguar.  I'm anxious to see what further developments will come up in further volumes.  Check them out, they are definitely worth your time.",1071964800,2,1550,4.3776223776223775
