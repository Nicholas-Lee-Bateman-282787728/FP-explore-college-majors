8386804,4,B00319ZP3O,I bought this for Heaven or Vegas. Love this strange niche film. Didn't care for the other 3 but for the price if you only want just one movie it is well worth it.,1462147200,,163,3.823529411764706

8386806,5,B00319ZP3O,"I give this 5 stars because all of the films were worth watching. French Exit was a bit improbable, but actress Madchen  Amick was worth it. Glam was a bit artsy. If there's a throw away here, this is the one. Heaven or Vegas was a bit violent. The character played by Yasmine Bleth was a little inconsistent. Nevertheless, there is an improbable but happy ending. Nevada is the most memorable and troubling. A woman leaves her family, husband and three children (1 teen, 2 younger), apparently because of burn out (not beatings or abuse). She arrives in a southwestern town populated by mostly attractive young women, whose husbands are away all week working on a dam. The family finds her but she refuses to return. This is popular with feminists who believe that this is freedom and more important than the responsibilities of family. 2 incidents are unbelievable. One of the husbands has a crush on the woman and attacks the father. The teenage son is very late to intervene. Unreal. Also, as the car pulls away, the young children are not crying over losing mommy but wave goodbye. Again, unreal.",1427068800,,1101,4.734375
