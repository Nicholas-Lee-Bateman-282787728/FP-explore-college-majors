The aerobics portion is maybe 3 minutes, in beginner and advanced classes.  The arm work uses no weights and mainly works your shoulders.  The ab routine is probly the only good part of the tape.  Dont waste your time trying to find this tape.

there are many better tapes out there.",1098921600,8,400,4.472222222222222

2169976,5,B00066J4PU,"What a great tape! Jane Fonda was my hero when I was in my early twenties, and now Im in my mid 50's and she is still kicking my butt!!
I only do the beginners, (there is beginner and advanced on this tape) because I like the 35 min time commitment (just enough for me, and no "" dread"" factor in working out) and also because I find that it is plenty hard enough for me! There isn't too much aerobic in this tape, but quite the workout otherwise, esp, the ab section.  I wouldnt say that is for beginners.  There is quite a lot of ab work imho. Lots of great stretching, wonderful waist and leg exercises.  There is a ""plough"" move at the end for the cool down, and although people say that is not a good move to do anymore, I just love it, and have had no ill effects from doing it.  Im 55, and I just love this workout., more so than the New workout she did in 1985 (although that has catchy singing in the aerobic section and is kind of fun, but the rest of the workout I don't find as good as this one.  The original, and there is a reason it is still a best seller , and is a best seller of all time in the workout industry.  You rock Jane!! Thank you!!!  Worth buying, and investing in yourself.",1398902400,,1201,4.0

2169978,5,B00066J4PU,"I used to exercise to Workout: Starring Jane Fonda as a kid with my mom.  As an adult, I really appreciate all of the pilates she incorporates into her routines.

For the 30-minute Beginner/Intermediate workout, I wouldn't rely on it for a cardiovascular exercise (though you'll breathe a little quicker than normal, especially during the warm-up), but it's definitely great for strengthening and toning!  The video is divided into a warm-up, ab exercises, leg and hip exercises, and gluteus exercises.  Then there's a cool-down that you may or may not want to take part in.  (It involves a shoulder-stand.)

I haven't done the hour-long Advanced workout in years (I think I tried it once back in college), but I remember it being pretty advanced.  Same principles as the beginner/intermediate video, but longer exercises.

As for the seller, I very highly recommend them!  Their service was quick, and they included a free, bonus DVD version of this video.  This was great because we were going to have to buy a VHS player or transfer the VHS to DVD ourselves.",1382918400,2,1061,4.910112359550562

2169989,5,B00066J4PU,"I wasn't born yet when this came out, but I stumbled upon it online a few months ago and was hooked!  Jane Fonda is a genius!  Her classic tried and true moves work wonders for my body type. I'm a hips and thighs girl and she focuses on my major areas that need toning.  Being a former dancer myself, I like her style better than today's workout gurus.  You don't need bulky weights, stretch bands or balls.  Just your body and a willingness to work hard.  Her workout gives you a ballet dancer's body which is what flatters my body type the most.  Except for the outdated and potentially dangerous bouncing, her moves can't be beat to this day.

Her Order of Target Areas Are:

-Warm Up
-Waist
-Abs
-Hips
-Thighs
-Butt
-Cool Down

It is not fancy - but believe me it works.  At this moment, I was stunned that I found another copy.  I wore out the two I previously owned and, even with the age of cyberspace, have yet to find another one.

On January 7, 2004, I awoke to say - enough is enough - no more weighing

211 pounds.  Today, June 10,2007, I awoke to make a decision about buying a particular dress and the only size the store had was a 6.  Presently, I

wear a size 10 and with the help of Weight Watchers and my own determination weight 141 - or 70 lbs less.

The road was steep and long - but if you want it enough - you can do it!

Trust me, if the original cheesecake baby did it, anyone can and that I know that I once again have this workout tape - dress ahead.

Please believe me - this tape is better than good - it is a lifesaver.

2170013,5,B00066J4PU,"This is one of the best and complex workouts on the market. First, let me tell you I am not really into weight -lifting , MTV workouts, or boot camps . NOt to mention kick-boxing or power workouts . I am a female, not a boxer, not a gang-member and I don't intend to be. I'm not in it for big, bulky muscles, you can consider me old-fashioned - but long, lean , fat-free muscles and some grace is all I am asking for. I've tried numerous workouts: tae-bo, yoga, and Denise Austin ( the Sizzler is the only one I recommend for toning), but none is able to achieve what this 80's VHS is able to do for me : flexibility, grace, and a total body workout that you will feel in your entire body for the next few days after .....

I am not going to talk about the beginners workout since it is really easy and it is all contained into the Advanced Workout  ; the Advanced Workout is divided into 6 different sections : warm-up, arms, abs, thighs, buttocks and cool-down. All of them are killers. Even the warm-up , which involves a lot of stretching.  The movements are repetitive and hard-to-follow but if you can get over this and if you understand that a good workout is not about entertainment or about modern , trendy hair-do's, then you're on the right track. The purpose of it is toning/stretching  and not weight-loss, so I am adding the cardio portion from JAne Fonda- the Challenge  before the video for fat-burning. I have  also noticed that my muscles respond better with some cardio added upfront. I just wish this workout had a cardio part as well, but what the heck we're all still in the search of the perfect workout ....

I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level (since I can do the Jane Fonda -CHallenge Workout as well) , I am in my 30's but I still look like in my 20's even after a childbirth , and I think this is partly due to my healthy eating habits, partly due to the workouts I do with regularity .Even though I am continuously buying other workout DVDs to keep myself motivated or to break the routine , I always come back to this one for a complete body workout. I definitely recommend it. Too bad it is not on DVD.",1164499200,6,2149,4.317617866004963

2170018,5,B00066J4PU,"I had been trying to get this video for a long time and I finally found a copy at a fair price in good condition.  I have read all the reviews of JANE FONDA WORKOUTS and I felt I just had to have this to add to my other tapes(NEW WORKOUT, EASY GOING,COMPLETE,CHALLENGE AND START UP).

  This video has two workouts, beginner and advanced.  The beginner is 30 minutes and the advanced is 55 minutes.  Each workout begins with a vigourous warmup followed immediatey by arms,waist,cardio exercises.  Then follows with a substantial abs, hip ,leg ,and butt exercises plus a cooldown.

  The beginner workout is good and really warms and streches your body, for me it is not enough I would follow with weights or more cardio.  However the advanced workout is still a challenge and I like that one best.  I have found that one of the really good factors to this and other JANE FONDA WORKOUTS is the streching, it really limbers you up and helps to create long lean muscles.  And the exercises are done in a way to maxamize your calorie buring potential.

However a word of note, do not expect a full cardio workout like that of other tapes. This cardio workout is really short. It is  more about toning using your body as resistance.  Becareful with some of the moves and streches it is possible to injure yourself if anything feels wrong just modify it to something you are accustomed to. One of the things I really like about these workouts are that they really keep you coming back. As an instructer Jane Fonda is really positive and upbeat but not in an annoying way.  I have really improved my cardiovascular health doing Jane Fonda videos something I was never abel to do with other newer tapes,  I do not know what it is, but I love these tapes.

For me, they are far better in quality, technique, and instruction.  Jane is engaging, she makes me feel like she really cares how I'm doing.  Whether it's true or not is irrelevant, it makes me want to work harder and finish.  That, to me, is a powerful motivator.  When she says, ""talk to me"" I do! lol

2170022,5,B00066J4PU,"Before Jane Fonda got America to its feet with exercise-in-your- home videotape series, the only serious participants were dancers, athletes or the very experienced exercisers.

In this video, her core exercise group seems to be those very fit and trim people who had exercised to sustain their body for their profession.

It is very clear to say that Jane Fonda's early videos, like this one, Complete Workout, Easy Workout, Prime Time Fitness, Workout With Weights, and the tough Jane Fonda Challenge Workout are all very good workouts.  These were done prior to the massive surge of competition that flooded the market, where everybody sold an exercise video.

Hence, Fonda's later videos suffered in quality!  Those being:  Lean Routine, Step Workout, Lower Body Solution, etc.

The Baby of 'em All
This 1982 classic video is the baby of 'em all.  The video comes in two sections, Beginners - 30 minutes and  Advanced - 60 minutes.

In her warm-up, she even does jumping jacks also with great stretching routines, and you will see movements that today's exercise gurus don't do anymore.  If you are new to exercising, you will feel the pain.

The basis of this workout is certain repetitive movements that focus on single muscle groups against the resistence of your own body weight.

Fonda works with every part of the body, from deep stretching to great waist work, grueling crunches, tendon stretches and serious deep lunges.  She uses repetitive counts for each segment.  At times, her voice overdubs the program to give advice and offer proper techniques while working out.

This is a tough workout, and if you are serious for strenuous workouts, and if you desire to improving your fitness regime, do this workout.  And get the companion book ""Jane Fonda Workout Book""

Then, try the Jane Fonda Challenge Workout, it has a very challenging aerobic section that is even tougher.  .....Rizzo",1106956800,74,1899,5.0095846645367414

8039341,3,B00066J4PU,"Three star rating is due to the bouncing, which can be dangerous.  Small pulses are safer.  The workout is tough.  It works your muscles- seriously.  Personally, I need more weight bearing exercise at my ripe old age of 59.  However, in my mid twenties, it would have been great.  I had the book and worked out from that.  I learned a lot, and I still use many of the moves today in the workouts I create for myself.  This workout seems to be designed for those who are already in decent shape.  I think it would have been discouraging for anyone out of shape or overweight.  I will continue to use it for the stretching and muscle toning.  I will continue to use other videos for sustaining bone density.",1424390400,,705,4.387596899224806
