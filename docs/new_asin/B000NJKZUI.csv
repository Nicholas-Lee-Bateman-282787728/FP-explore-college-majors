2769534,4,B000NJKZUI,"I didn't know what to expect when I first saw this movie. I thought it would be campy. . . etc. However I was surprised. It is an extremely well-acted film that treats a delicate subject with class and beauty.
The movie starts off humorously enough, with one of the main characters--Griffin (played brilliantly by Dermot Mulroney) finding out some life-altering news. He then meets a woman named Phoenix(Amanda Peet) at university where he has decided to take a class. He falls in love with her, and she with him.
It is a beautiful love story with a twist. It is definitely not your normal love story, as previous people who have reviewed this film would say. This is not a movie for everyone, as this movie can be hard to stomach. Long interludes, slow-moving dialog, and slightly implausible situations, make this movie slightly difficult to watch. However if you can sit through all the quietness, this movie is worth the view at least once.",1189728000,16,944,4.7272727272727275
2769535,5,B000NJKZUI,"I actually first caught this movie on the Lifetime Movie Network, and had never heard of it before that. However, I soon found myself engrossed in it. It's not your typical love story, but that's what is so good about it. Two people meet and slowly fall in love, but there's a big secret that each of them has that they're not sharing with the other that ends up making all the difference in how they relate to each other. By the time you finish watching this movie, you'll have rethought everything about your life and how you're living it, and if you have a significant other, you'll both be brought closer by this story. It's a very powerful love that these two people share, made all the more intense by their situation. This may not be a blockbuster, but I highly recommend that anyone who has ever spent their time whining about how hard they have it pick this up and watch it.",1187481600,67,883,4.390243902439025

2769580,1,B000NJKZUI,Watch the Peter Falk/Jill Clayburgh one as this 2007 remake is a complete waste of film besides being a scene for scene remake except that they changed & made a lame worthless ending to this one compared to the original. Should have remastered the 1976 one & never remade it with this piece of junk. I suppose if the producers remade Duel they would change the ending to where Dennis Weaver buys the truck driver lunch before he runs off the cliff.,1331424000,7,448,4.475609756097561
2769581,3,B000NJKZUI,"First off, this couple looks way too healthy all through this movie to be both on the brink of death from fatal cancers. Even when the woman enters the hospital for the last time, her hair shines perfectly. No bags under her eyes, or skeletal frame here. I know, I know, the message here is really important, things about living to the max and never too late for love etc etc. But the combination of the mopey soundtrack and the depressing subject really set me back a few steps. Not since Ryan O'Neill and Ali McGraw in ""Love Story"" has a fatal illness movie crossed my viewing path. If you can stand the emotional impact, then watch this. But if you cry easily, or prefer to avoid sentimental romance films about death, avoid avoid.",1325030400,3,734,4.485074626865671
2769582,3,B000NJKZUI,"This is a message movie and appears directed at those living with terminal illnesses although the messages of living life, love and priorities are relevant to all. This movie is blunt, often witty and clich at delivering its bitter-sweet message. I would not discourage anyone from seeing this touching, occasionally humorous and often heartbreaking movie.

The story of two terminally ill people with very little time to live who accidentally fall in love and complete a portion of their 'bucket lists' together, content to enjoy together what remains of their lives while learning anew how to love and the real priorities of life, this movie shows that life and time are precious, unpredictable and best shared with others you love.

The acting by both Dermot Mulroney and Amanda Peet was consistently good, emotional and carry the movie which suffers somewhat from editing and production flaws. The story is delivered hurriedly. Dialog is witty but occasionally clich; purposeful at delivering its intended message within it short run time, but heartwarming and effective enough at the right moments with elements of humor. There are some iconic visuals such as the clock tower scene. Music used is popular, current (fresh), and relevant to the theme of the moment. I want to purchase the soundtrack!

Editing and production issues are the main challenges of this movie. The run time (1:42) felt insufficient to fully develop this two part story (PART 1: Initial love story, PART 2: Subsequent end of life story). As a consequence, some scenes felt 'staged', key dialog like Phoenix's 'coming out' and certain scenes like their using medications at lunch seem too blunt, weakening the movies overall effectiveness. The emotional impact could have been many times more intense had more time been given to develop the characters relationship, budding love and sincere emotional attachment. Despite the dialog and editing limitations, the actors consistently delivered emotional performances. Production issues included shaky cameras, lighting issues and a few 'TV' quality shots. Much of the dialog sounded dubbed-over, sound booth quality and a few sets appeared like a TV sound stage.",1320796800,,2187,5.296829971181556
2769583,4,B000NJKZUI,"I stumbled across this movie on accident when I was researching something else online and I told a friend about it. She added it to her Netflix list and reported back that she really liked it a lot so I ordered it on Amazon. (I'm a huge fan of both Dermot Mulroney and Amanda Peet, I would have wanted to own it just having both of them in it.)
I finally sat down and watched it tonight and loved it.
It's quirky and heavy and charming and heartwarming.
I've read reviews in which both Mulroney and Peet received very good marks for their performances and I completely agree. This subject matter is hard to handle but it was done well - showing both the delicacy of the situation and the full on anger that comes with it.
I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone looking for a tug on the heartstrings or a touch of raw human emotion.",1314921600,2,848,4.2407407407407405

2769586,5,B000NJKZUI,"I never saw or heard of this movie before last week.  I just rented it from Blockbuster because I like Dermot Mulroney and Amanda Peet.  Since renting it last Sunday, I have seen it 5 times.  This is now one of my all-time favorite love stories and I usually HATE movies that don't have the typical happy ending.  This ending was not typical but very satisfying.  I am now going to purchase it on Amazon because in my opinion, it is a must-have in any DVD collection.  If, before seeing this movie, I had read a review that had told me to bring a box of kleenex, I would have avoided it at all costs but in this case, the tears are cathartic, not distressing.  Really, Griffin and Phoenix makes you think and cry and hope and want to see it again and again.",1258761600,,757,4.215277777777778
2769587,4,B000NJKZUI,I thought this would be sad and about death.  It has some of that but it is really full of life.  This movie has a warm glow that you will enjoy as well.,1258329600,,153,3.606060606060606
2769588,5,B000NJKZUI,"I saw this movie on television, and after I bought it, I watched and

2769589,5,B000NJKZUI,"not your avg love story, but a refreshing attempt at showing life does go on despite difficult circumstances. It was a touching portrayal of how coping with death doesn't diminish the need for love, meaning and connection in the rough times. Relationships are necessary in the worst of scenarios, and possibly less jaded. I found it delightful and real.",1239494400,,353,5.0
2769590,2,B000NJKZUI,"The original movie is no longer available, so I ordered this. A sad second. Hopefully someday the original movie will be available again. No comparison.",1238284800,7,152,5.12
2769591,4,B000NJKZUI,"I hate most romantic comedies.  They're schmaltzy and written badly and reek of vanilla.  I was cautious when I picked this one up.  I had wanted to rent the original, but it was nowhere to be found.  And to be quite honest, it's not straightforward comedy.  For those who are accustomed to the icky, tacked on happy ending, this will not be your cup of tea.  It has tragedy, THE HORROR!!!  As much as I abhor the term "" chick flick "" ( why there isn't a similar derogatory phrase for guy's films I don't know), it does have some of the familiar standbys that women are used to.  & I must admit I fell prey to a deluge of tears.  If you want quirk and sarcasm instead of teddy bears and roses, I strongly recommend you check this one out.",1226620800,2,738,4.177304964539007
2769592,5,B000NJKZUI,"It is ironic that a film about 'death' is so 'life' affirming..
Without being corney it is a sentimental masterpiece..A real film about real people...people growing in understanding and appreciation while slowly getting rid of all of the garbage that had been poured into their lives before they met...Someday, Hollywood get tired of explosions and obsenties and return to films such as these that enrich the viewer...",1221782400,,418,5.253731343283582
2769593,5,B000NJKZUI,i have a crush on amanda.  this movie deals with death but life too.  Two people with something in common the end of there lives.  both have different ways of dealing with a terminal illness but find time for each other.  I guess a man shouldn't have emotions about a movie that makes you laugh and cry. cancer has a way of sneaking up on you.  she is such a doll.,1216857600,,364,4.070422535211268

2769595,5,B000NJKZUI,"This movie is a must to view, it touched my heart in the most possible way, you will need a box of kleenex and view it with the love of your life.  The movie stars (Dermot Mulroney) as Griffin and ( Amanda Peet) as Sara Phoenix. He discovers he is dying and falls in love with Sara who also is dying, These 2 characters have such good chemistry together til the end. Please view this movie, I will now go and search to purchase.

This movie is all about doing what you always wanted to do. No boundaries.  What would you do if you only had a small time to live. AND no I didn't give anything away you know that in the 1st 3 mins.  Get this movie I have not cried and laughed this much at the same time in a long time.  AND it's funny.  Dermot Mulroney is funny. And Amanda Peet well--she'll always be Jordan McDear to me. She's wonderful!  And this movie is wonderful as well. GET IT!  DO IT.  Do it.,1209772800,3,634,3.984126984126984
2769597,5,B000NJKZUI,This movie is an inspiring and moving tale of what can happen when two people truly open their hearts and allow themselves to love freely.

It is a lesson on how to truly love another for everyone who watches it - and especially if you are a man - take note of what Griffin does to win and keep the heart of Phoenix - your woman will love you for it!,1209254400,,471,4.413793103448276

I could not even hold back my tears it was well written and I thought that the ending was written perfectly. The on compliant I do have is that is said comedy and that was the reason I got the movie I do admit there was a couple of funny things but this is no comedy it is a story of life, love and death. I am not disappointed in this movie and I have already told a number of people to watch it. I think this is a movie that everyone should have in there collection .",1204156800,,566,3.805084745762712

Please: Heartwarming and romantic it may be, but a comedy its not -- from the very first scene it's about death, and it's not black humor.  No living happily ever after here.  Good drama; no romantic comedy.",1201564800,13,335,4.842105263157895
2769601,3,B000NJKZUI,"The movie starts from a very similar situation as a novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Things-First-Things/dp/0595269427/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Things, First Things</a>, published three years earlier; but in that novel, there is a strong plot and the situation is played out much more effectively.

This is not a bad movie, though.  The woman who plays the main character is very appealing (as well as pretty) and makes the various scenes in the movie affecting.  And there are some good moments.  It also is set entirely in and around Manhattan, which will appeal to New Yorkers.

But it's a odd movie, typified by the fact that the lead actor is pictured as a blonde in several places on the cover but has black hair in the movie.  He also seems to be trying to do a Sylvester Stallone impersonation.  I like Stallone, but it is disorienting to be constantly reminded of a different actor.

The reaction to the bad news is understandable--they play harmless pranks--but is this the best for a movie?  And do we have to see so many of them, one after another?  Couldn't they have thought of at least a few other things to do?  And what type of audience is it that relates to such behavior?  The joking behavior is also understandable, but in the beginning it is a little jarring until we get used to it.

The rock songs at the beginning are also an odd choice.  What audience is this movie for?  Rock appeals to the younger half, but they like fast-paced, action movies, not slow, laid-back material about people dying.  The older audience who might like this, typically do not relate to rock.  To them, it is an irritant that detracts from the feel of the movie.

So, make your choice or toss a coin.  Or read the novel.  It's a safer bet.",1199836800,3,1802,4.865131578947368

2769608,4,B000NJKZUI,"GRIFFIN & PHOENIX is a quiet little made for television film that touches the vulnerable heart.  Originally written in 1976 as a television film by John Hill, this thirty-years-later version holds up well, and the fact that audiences will still opt for sensitive stories that treat difficult topics in a mature manner, adding warmly humorous touches to a potentially maudlin idea, speaks well for our continuing tastes.

From the opening frames of the film we learn that Griffin (Dermot Mulroney) has inoperable cancer: his frank and compassionate physician (Lois Smith) aligns him with reality. Griffin is a divorced father of two boys and his first attempt to find meaning in his limited time is to spend time with them, an attempt partially thwarted by his ex-wife.  Once a workaholic, Griffin attends a class on death and dying at the university and there he meets the rather strange and isolated Phoenix (Amanda Peet).  Griffin's new take on life encourages him to go after the seemingly impenetrable Phoenix and through a series of wildly frivolous escapades he courts her and they gradually fall in love - something neither felt they could do.  They cope with issues of intimacy and finally Phoenix shares her secret with Griffin, a secret that plunges them headlong into a fully blossomed romance.  How the two cope with the inevitable is well handled, rarely bordering on sappy, and always holding our compassion.

Director Ed Stone paces the film well, inserting moments of extended silence to match the emotional atmosphere, allowing breathing space.  Both Peet and Mulroney create believable three-dimensional characters and are well supported by such solid actors as Lois Smith, Sarah Paulson, and Novella Nelson.  The story may have sad aspects, but the cast always allows the humor inherent in any life event to come through.  And that is one of the several reasons the film works well.
