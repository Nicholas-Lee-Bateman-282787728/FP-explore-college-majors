7816980,5,6301931750,"This is perhaps the best Harry Langdon film to watch to see the genius of the comedian. Many trademark jokes are included in the film including his climbing the stairs bit. Also, we get to see the best of his humor, some of the more wholesome jokes (as opposed to finding comedy in attempted murder like in Long Pants).

The Strong Man is the story of a meek and mild Frenchman (Langdon) who travels to America as part of a strong man act with a man who captured him in the war. He decides to go on a quest to meet the woman who wrote to him in the war and professed her love for him, Mary Brown (Priscilla Bonner). This leads to some very funny run-ins, especially that with a jazz baby with ties to gangsters. Eventually, he is led to a town divided into the hooligans who run things with their bootlegged liquor and loose women and the straight-laced Christians who have faith that the sin will stop eventually. Langdon finds Mary in the town, the daughter of a preacher. The climax of the film happens when Langdon's partner gets too drunk to perform, forcing Langdon to go on in his place. Lets just say he brings the house down.

If you don't find yourself laughing out loud constantly, just remind yourself that Langdon was much slower with his delivery than some of the other comics of the era. Some do not believe in his talent, but others feel quite strongly about it. It seems to be most evident here in one of his most universally popular films.

Another wonderful aspect of this film is the music score. It is peppered with familiar tunes of the era and contributes a whole other dimension of humor to the film.",1163376000,4,1624,4.406666666666666
7816981,5,6301931750,"A great introduction to Harry Langdon, and a bonus for those interested in the genesis of director Frank Capra. The print quality is beautifully crystal clear -- it really shows what silent films were supposed to look  like. I love Keaton and appreciate Chaplin and Lloyd, but there's something  special about Langdon. This film, especially, showcases his subtlety of  expression: his ""innocent"" face reflecting undercurrents of malice,  longing, and sexual anxiety. Yeah, and it's funny. And sweet. My  appreciation of ""The Strong Man"" was heightened by reading Walter Kerr's  ""The Silent Clowns,"" which features some of the most definitive  writing ever done on Langdon and certainly the most in-depth examination of  this film. You'll spot new things with repeated viewings (check out the  extra in the patterned dress who walks past Harry on his street corner  again and again.) Even if comedy, Capra or silent film aren't your thing,  you might like this just for the fabulous `20s fashions and decor.",956620800,,1006,5.186335403726708
7816982,3,6301931750,"Langdon, often described as the fourth great clown of the silent era (after Chaplin, Keaton, and Langdon), can be a little hard to take. His characters are intentionally immature and ineffectual. But if you're  patient, there's funny stuff here, and watch out for an unexpected  slam-bang finale where little Harry is forced to perform a strongman act!",954460800,,352,5.157894736842105
7816983,5,6301931750,"I love Harry Langdon but realize that not everyone gets his comedy. His character is basically an odd, innocent creature who seems stuck in childhood though he inhabits the body of a man. It is the interaction of  this boy-man with the grown up world around him that forms the basis for  his comedy. One of the greatest natural mimes, Langdon fascinating to  watch. He has hundreds of subtle, revealing gestures and expressions which  can charm and dazzle with their balletic grace and comical nuance. When he  had a good director (as in this film), he joins the ranks of Chaplin and  Keaton. Yes, he can be that good. That his career went off kilter and he  ended up in quickly and cheaply made shorts is one of the great tragedies  of cinema. Clearly, the man had enormous talent. A true fan, I find even  his worst films fascinating to watch only because he is one of the most  subtle of the film comics. When Harry was good, he was great. This is a  great silent comedy. After watching it, many people who have never heard of  Langdon become fans.",945993600,6,1051,4.473684210526316
