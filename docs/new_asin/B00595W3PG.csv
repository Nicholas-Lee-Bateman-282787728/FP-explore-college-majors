4620196,4,B00595W3PG,"Some of the best episodes yet.  HOWEVER, after purchasing three CD's of Season 6, part 2, they were all defective. The first two discs were fine.  The third disc stopped on Sloss Furnaces and there was nothing beyond that point. I've tried from three separate vendors....all the same!  Hopefully they can get this corrected so that we can complete our collection.",1321488000,3,363,4.918032786885246
4620197,3,B00595W3PG,"It just seems like every show of theres is almost the excat same. Jason and grant say the same things over and over, and they spend more time reviewing evidance that looking for it. Go with a diffrent show.",1320796800,,206,4.3076923076923075
4620198,1,B00595W3PG,They been caught as fakes but hey they will keep doing it as long as they keep getting truck loads of cash.  I would be cool with the show if they didn't keep saying 100% real.  Like the other shows I will watch cause you know its mostly crap but fun to watch.  These guys keep saying that its real.  Youtube some ghost hunters taps fake clips and learn,1318291200,6,353,4.072463768115942
4620199,5,B00595W3PG,"In my opinion, Ghost Hunters is an awesome show; I've loved and enjoyed it since it started. No offense to anyone, but I do not find this show boring. While they may not always find a lot of evidence or see numurous apparitions I still am very pleased with it. There couldn't be things like that happening all of the time anyhow. Otherwise, to me, it would seem to be all made up and fake. That's how I feel about lots of the paranormal shows. Ghost Hunters is one of the only shows that's realistic, considering that they check for more logical reasons to what the people are experiencing. They don't just go in saying ""This place is definitley haunted"". To me that is quite nice. So, I stand by this show all the way. Anyhow, if this show is not for you, that's okay. However, if you're a fan then I would recommend this DVD! Thank you.",1318204800,8,838,4.310126582278481
4620200,2,B00595W3PG,"I give this show credit for starting a cable TV craze on the paranormal.  Nearly every channel I turn to has the ubiquitous jerky night-vision camera shots of dazed looking faces with glowing irises as they listen to old houses creak and groan, they lead to a big build-up someone screams, cut to commercial and when you return from your trip to the bathroom or refrigerator you find out they had been startled by a mouse or a bug or their own flatulence, whatever...  If there is anything to claims of the paranormal Ghost Hunters do very little to promote real study in the field.  The show fails even in the rhelm of entertainment as most episodes are so predictable and so dull that its a wonder if I can stay awake through one.  Even the stars of the show and the founders of TAPS, Jason and Grant, look bored out of their minds.  So watch if you must but you might have more fun if you pop in your old DVD of ""Ghostbusters.""",1317772800,4,930,4.32183908045977

Great season here and my favorite episodes are Lemp Mansion, Milton School, Canfield Casino and the Bissman building. Steve and Tango are not in a few of these episodes as they were on Ghost Hunters Academy in 2010. They are substituted by Britt and KJ who are both great investigators and are regular cast members in Season 7. Also expect the Widescreen format that has been used since Season 5.",1317686400,11,2003,4.6875
4620202,4,B00595W3PG,"I lke these tapes,  I started watching Ghost hunters from the first, it's got a lot of very good shows, I only thing is I don't like the idea about Grant having to leave the team.",1403136000,,179,3.9722222222222223
4620203,4,B00595W3PG,"I wanted to get this one , esp since I was at one of the haunted houses in this Season. The Lemp Mansion, in the St Louis area . A very interesting investigation team !!!!",1401580800,,171,3.914285714285714
4620204,5,B00595W3PG,I got this movie for me I an a huge ghost hunter fan so is my daughter and father who is in a nursing home.  I thought this will be a way we can spend time together..  The movie is like brand new.  This seller had a great price and they delivered them before they said they would.  I will order from this seller again and I have ordered from them several times over the last 2 years.,1394582400,,383,3.871794871794872

4620206,1,B00595W3PG,"My boyfriend loves this show however upon receiving merchandise, I could hear the discs were loose inside the box. I opened immediately and sure enough 2 of the 3 discs arrived completely scratched beyond use. I went online and immediately reported it to Amazon and a replacement order was sent out even before I had returned the damaged set. The second order arrived before Christmas which was good as it was a gift however upon receiving the 2nd order, all 3 discs were loose this time. I think since it is a larger box where the box is maybe flexed in shipping causing the discs to come loose. Too bad as I said the show is great, but it really was just the shipping on Amazon's behalf with this order.",1388102400,,705,4.430769230769231
4620207,5,B00595W3PG,Big fan of the TV series and have all the seasons so far and do watch them over and over again.,1384646400,,95,3.5714285714285716
4620208,5,B00595W3PG,This group is very professional yet have fun doing what they do.  Love Grant & his partner!!!  And they always put a nice group together to do the investigations.  I've watched every series & will continue.,1375747200,,206,4.666666666666667
4620209,5,B00595W3PG,One of my favorite shows! I have every season that is out so far and I will keep buying them all til they stop making them! :),1374192000,,126,3.7037037037037037
4620210,1,B00595W3PG,Got it from wherehouse music case came wrap like fye dose but ever disc was lose in the case and had rings of scratches all disc are in bad shape the show is really GD just don't get from wherehouse music,1370563200,,204,4.0

4620212,3,B00595W3PG,The star rating doesn't reflect the show at all. It reflects the damn DVD's. After selecting a couple different vendors and having no success we have concluded Season 6 Part 2 is defective. I'd appreciate Amazon or someone please help we want our collection.,1358899200,,258,4.886363636363637
4620213,5,B00595W3PG,"I had stopped watching after season five, but came back recently and bought all the dvds available up to this point.  Compared to much flashier, screamier ghost hunting shows, this looks quite respectable.  I am really enjoying the new episodes.  The haunted school building and the Bissman building episode, which I am watching for the first time right now, are quite good.  You don't have to believe in ghosts to enjoy watching the guys, (and girls) walk around creepy, echoing dark places.  Jason is like a big cat and nothing scares him.  At worse, if it starts to, you can see he enjoys it and it makes him laugh.  So manly.  :)  I love this show.  Oh, and Steve is really cool  So often these paranormal shows make you roll your eyes as people make wild and unsubstantiated claims, but then I think of Steve who doesn't say it happens unless it REALLY happens.  I love all the different paranormal shows, but this is still the most respectable, despite some scandal and bad behavior off screen by it's cast.  If you like this sort of show, you will be glad you bought every episode.  I did and am really enjoying watching them late at night when I can't sleep.  I don't know how the show will continue without 'good with people' Grant, who leaves a few seasons out from this, but I hope they will adjust and struggle on.",1357948800,,1326,4.489539748953975
4620214,2,B00595W3PG,I recieved this with season 7 part 1. The box from amazon was poorly handled not even a piece of tape to keep closed. The DVD box was made for four disks and leads me to think it was pirated. It was also cracked and the disks although playable were scratched. The season 7 DVD box was a joke. Thin as a single disk box all four disks piled on top of each other. Also making me think was a fake copy. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the disks although scratched were playable and the show is great. As far as shipping I am very disapointed. I have ordered many things from amazon and have never recieved such poor packaging from either amazon or a product.,1350518400,,668,4.106870229007634
4620215,5,B00595W3PG,This season was packed full of interesting findings and very interesting facts and details about the paranormal. Could not stop watching!,1344816000,,137,5.571428571428571
4620216,5,B00595W3PG,"These episodes contain some of the last episodes of the best 6 investigators (at least in my opinion): Jason Hawes, Grant Wilson, Steve Gonsalves, Dave Tango, Kris Williams, and Amy Bruni.  Kris leaves at the end of this season for GHI.  A definite buy!",1332979200,,253,4.7272727272727275
4620217,5,B00595W3PG,Love this series. 2 of the dvd's have sticking points and will not play. Perhaps I could get them replaced.,1331769600,,107,4.4
4620218,3,B00595W3PG,When I got this season today the first disc of part two was loose and it was scratched up. It looks like it would play but I will check in the morning. The good thing is that I didn't have to pay for shipping and it only cost me $2.00 above regular retail price of one part to get both parts of the season on Amazon. It's a great savings. Not only that the post office got my shipment to me in less time then what the estimated time was.,1325721600,,437,3.8666666666666667
4620219,5,B00595W3PG,"As all their shows are this one has not let me down, it's as good as the rest of the seasons have been.  I love this show and I think it is one of the best there is on syfy.  You guys rock and I will continue to watch and buy your seasons.",1324857600,3,239,3.490566037735849
4620220,4,B00595W3PG,"Standard Ghost Hunters season.  I still feel season 3 and 4 are the best as far as specific investigations go.  The two main players maintain their level of scrutiny in cases.
One of the downsides is that I don't care for KJ and Brit's methods and jumping to little noises and claiming to see shadows moving all the time.  the good news is Steve/Tango return somewhere along the line so KJ/Brit aren't in every case.",1322956800,3,416,4.52
4620221,1,B00595W3PG,"Why spend 40 minutes watching paint dry or
watching a kettle boil (dry) or
watching grass grow or
watching the hair on your nose curl or
watching your toe nails get longer or
watching re-runs of ""I love Lucy"" or
watching your washing drying or
watching your goldfish or
watching your cat or dog clean its bum or
watching fox news or
watching poker on espn?
When you could be watching an episode of
Ghost Hunters instead!
It has everything but the ghost.
