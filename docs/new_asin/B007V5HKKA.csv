8522135,5,B007V5HKKA,"This movie is so good. It is really about a man's complete transformation. Kevin Kline has become one of the most humble people I know. He performs super-human feats of running, all to bring attention to the struggle that faces children with cancer. It is wonderful how Kevin relates to the kids and raises money to fund research and treatment in childhood cancer. Get this movie. It restores faith in humanity. Groups of people together can make a difference and make this world a better place.",1344211200,5,495,4.767441860465116
