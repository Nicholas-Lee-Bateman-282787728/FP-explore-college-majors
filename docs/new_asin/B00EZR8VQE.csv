8610916,5,B00EZR8VQE,"The main character was taken away by Poonam's beauty to the point of near obsession and illustrates how irrational men and, in this case,young men become. He fails to exercise the proper amount of social self-restraint and allows himself to be so consumed that he commits an act of voyeurism. While Poonam resents him for it, she has the maturity to understand he is a young man coming of age and reaches out to him to show him that he needs to see her as a whole person and not as merely an object of his desire. On the whole you get the sense that Poonam helps him grow as a person. But men will be men and that is the nature of the beast as seen when Poonam's boyfriend violates a younger woman. The whirlwind of emotion is too much for Poonam who seeks the sympathy of the young man in her time of need and disappointment. While the young man is able to achieve his immediate gratification, he learns the hard way that this is no basis for a lasting relationship with Poonam who must depart. I found the movie to convey a moral that we must temper our desires and suffer the consequences when we don't. I think the young man in the movie learns a valuable life lesson that is universal in the sense that in our quest for romantic attachments we must cultivate them or we otherwise just wind up digging a deep hole for ourselves instead. Contrasting this movie with Shallow Hal starring Gwyneth Paltrow, I think I admire Nasha more because it somehow has a greater element of depth and subtlety giving it more artistic merit. This movie is like a boxing match that goes all 15 rounds and you appreciate having the patience to hang in there until the end in whereas Shallow Hal kind of hits you square between the  eyes with its message and there isn't much struggle involved. You just get your typical entertainment value that appeals to a wide audience to insure Hollywood delivers at the box office.",1435881600,3,1904,4.44
