8590406,5,B003IQ93TM,"have been waiting for this DVD for forever....Loved it when I first saw it  and was afraid that it would not fare well with time  but no problem  it is still JUST AS WONDERFUL.  Great singing and dancing, cute story  and FABULOUS homage to Gene Kelly Fred Astaire and the musicals of the 50's.
A must see for anyone who who needs an uplifting evening of pure entertainment.",1484524800,,373,4.426470588235294
