7969893,4,B00006IZI0,"i paid <$3 for this dvd, it is great for a beginner. i thought i was getting a book with good color pictures ..lol
 this would be good to watch while you are making your first suit or helping a friend make one. it has some gems but they are just mentioned and not really explained. at one point a man is applying facial camouflage and he says put the dark on the high spots. if you didn't know the concept he was speaking to you would miss the whole point and the dvd plays on while you are oblivious to the point.

this dvd is for the beginner or a hunter/ amateur camera man.
this will not go into the nuances of camouflage theory and technique.
but if your not planning to go all out or need to bet your life on the fact that you are hidden this is worth the <$5",1405641600,,765,3.961038961038961
7969894,3,B00006IZI0,It was just ok. Seems like it was more of a basic film done a few years ago and didn't really cover any of the more modern types of camouflage or newer ideas.,1370390400,,158,3.8181818181818183
7969895,5,B00006IZI0,"This DVD is a great start for people who are ready to get started in making a Ghillie or improving on what they already have.
For those of you who don't like documentaries you will be broad.  But if you put it on while your doing something else could help.
The format is an older video stile so the quality is not HD!  Hope that doesn't kill you!
Enjoyed it, hope you do too.",1278979200,,375,4.054054054054054
7969896,5,B00006IZI0,A good informative DVD. Takes you step by step in creating a ghillie suit. How to camouflage your face with paint and many other tricks.,1269734400,,136,4.48
7969897,5,B00006IZI0,"I bought this DVD to learn how to make a Ghille suit.  This DVD does an excellent job giving the step by step process on how to do this.  I knew nothing about making a ghille before watching this and my ghille turned out excellent.

A few suggestions if you use this to make your ghille.
1. Don't use the shoe goo, sew your netting on... it's MUCH more secure
2. You need to give your burlap or jute a ""hair cut"" so it isn't so uniform",1216598400,7,435,3.9770114942528734
7969898,5,B00006IZI0,"I have both Art of Camouflage I and II, and I reccomend both depending on what you need. The first one teaches you how to create a ghillie suit out of a Military Airforce style Flightsuit. In this is describes it perfectly, and I wish I had this before I made my ghillie suit. They also show you how to camouflage your face with paint. They tell you small tid bits of information that can be helpful such as, How long certain vegetation lasts. It shows you how to create 3 types of suits, first the Military Ghillie suit, The Yehti, and then the Bushrag. The information as a whole was very well done, but don't expect Blockbuster fliming and actors though, but they do an excellent Job in explaining everything. I reccomend this to anyone, including Paintballers, and airsofters who are looking to create a ghillie suit, or just learn some tricks. In the Art of Camouflage II It teaches you how to go beyond the basic ghillie suit. This one I believe, is not as well done, but still provides valuable information for creating and adapting ghillie suits.",1168646400,17,1054,4.552631578947368
7969899,5,B00006IZI0,This is a great video. If you are in the market for a Ghillie suit then the [$$] you spend on this video will be well spent. You can waste alot of your time by trial and error making a suit or you can watch these guys and learn all the shortcuts and tips.,1037577600,,255,3.740740740740741
7969900,4,B00006IZI0,"This documentary is the best how-to video out there on the subject of constructing a ghillie suit.  If you have never put a ghillie together before, this is a video you must own; however, former military snipers and Special Forces guys will find nothing new here.",1037318400,,263,4.717391304347826
