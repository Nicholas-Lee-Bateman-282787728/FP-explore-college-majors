8332197,5,B001P5YIQG,"The theme of these PPV'S were Main Event Mafia The Established Wrestling Legends Vs The Frontline which consisted of the Heart of TNA in The TNA Ordinals plus Team 3D and Mick Foley fighting to help the young guys get their spots and opportunities joining them against the Main Event Mafia. It was like Kurt Angle and WCW Reunited vs TNA Originals and ECW.

  Turning Point 2008

Elimination Match: Eric Young vs. Jay Lethal vs. Consequences Creed vs. Petey Williams vs. Jimmy Rave vs. Homicide vs. Doug Williams, vs. Tanahashi vs. Volador vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Jimmy Rave. This was a great match packed with some the best young talent TNA had to offer. It was a great opener. Eric Young was always a very underrated wrestler. Petey Williams was overlooked as he was a great wrestler. Homicide was great. Jay Lethal was always great and achieved a lot of early success in TNA.

Taylor Wilde & Roxxi vs. Awesome Kong & Raisha Saeed - The Knockout Division was at it's best during this time I think sadly it was missing Gail Kim but this was a great match. Awesome Kong is one of the greatest female wrestlers ever. Taylor Wilde was the upset Queen and a great champion. Roxxi was always overlooked she was a good worker who should have got a title run. Saeed of course also known as Cheerleader Melissa was an awesome wrestler. Solid match.

Rhino vs. Sheik Abdul Bashir - This was a good match. I was never a big Bashir guy he was a good worker but I don't think TNA needed him I feel like he came on the scene in the X-Division and got the belt when TNA would be better served elevating Homicide or even Sonjay Dutt with the belt who had been around a long time. Bashir was a good heel. Rhino was a great worker and I liked him in TNA but I felt he got the shaft. It seems like they had Rhino lose to everyone. He did get a NWA Title run and win at their best PPV Bound For Glory. But his run was brief. But you never got a bad match with Rhino.

TNA Tag Team Champions Beer Money Inc. vs. Motor City Machine Guns - Great match by two of the best tag teams in TNA. It is a dream match Beer Money was a pretty hot tag team then but the Guns were up and coming.

TNA Legends Champion Booker T vs. Christian Cage - Great match between Booker T and Cage. The stipulation was if Cage lost he was to join the Main Event Mafia. Booker T beat him and they fired Cage marking the end of Cage's TNA career as he would return to WWE. I thought it was a big loss for TNA but Cage had run his course with TNA. This was a great victory in Booker T's TNA Career as he ended Cage's Career in TNA. I would have liked to see Booker T get a World Title run but The Legends Title was a good thing for Booker it was like The TV Title in WCW. He had great matches with it and was noticed.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Abyss vs. Kurt Angle This match was off the hook. This was the best match Abyss ever had I dare say. Kurt and him tore it up. It was an exciting rollercoaster ride and exceeded expectations. Kurt proved why he is one of the greatest wrestlers of all time in the history of wrestling. When Kurt said on Impact 'I am TNA!' He was kind of true. He delivers in the big matches.

Samoa Joe vs. Kevin Nash -This was one of my favorite matches between two of my favorite wrestlers. Nash got the win which was nice to see as I am a big Nash fan and that continued to build the storyline. Joe and Nash had a great match. For Joe this was a tough loss and for Nash this was just the beginning of his rise back into the full time wrestling picture as later on in the next year he won The TNA Legends Belt.

TNA Champion Sting vs. A.J. Styles This was my favorite match of the night. Much better than their Bound For Glory match that was too short. I am a huge Sting fan and this was a dream match to see him go up against AJ Styles in his prime and come out with a big victory in his TNA Career.

  Overall This Was One Of The Best TNA PPV'S From Top To Bottom The Card Was Solid.

Final Resolution 2008

Feast Or Fired Match: L.A.X. vs. Jay Lethal vs. Curry Man vs. Shark Boy vs. Consequences Creed vs. B.G. James vs. Motor City Machine Guns vs Rock N' Rave Infection vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Cute Kip- These Feast or fired matches are pretty cool. It was a great match with good results. I would have liked to see Cute Kip win a World title shot but Hernandez deserved it most. Homicide won the X-Division title shot which was the right move. I would have liked to see the guns win the tag shot but Jay Lethal did. That was ok I like him too. Curry Man was fired. Good way to start the show.

Taylor Wilde, O.D.B., Roxxi vs. Beautiful People & Sharmell - This was an okay match.

X Division Champion Sheik Abdul Bashir vs. Eric Young- Great match between Bashir and Young. Bashir proved his worth in TNA and Young proved he was a TNA Star on the rise.

TNA Knockouts Champion Awesome Kong vs. Christy Hemme- Great match I love Christy and Kong. Some of my favorite Knockouts. Kong never had a bad match and Hemme has improved her in ring skills.

TNA Tag Team Champions Beer Money Inc. vs. Abyss & Matt Morgan- Great match I liked the unlikely team of Morgan and Abyss but Beer Money was the class of the tag team wrestling scene during this time. It was a good match up and fun match.

Rhino vs. Kurt Angle w/Mick Foley as the Special Enforcer This was a great match between Rhino and Angle. Angle won to ensure his rematch with Jarrett at the next pay per view. This was another strong showing by Rhino as he was headed back in the main event picture to go against Sting at the next ppv.

Main Event Mafia (TNA Champion Sting, Kevin Nash, Booker T, Scott Steiner) vs. TNA Frontline (A.J. Styles, Samoa Joe, Team 3D- This was the match of the night and a great main event. It was great to see the full factions go up against each other. It was a fun rivalry and a great time to be a TNA fan.

Genesis 2009:

Jeff Jarrett vs Kurt Angle was an awesome match. One of the best matches on the card. It was a good back and forth contest with both men telling a great wrestling story.

Foley, Styles, Devon vs Booker T, Cute Kip and Steiner. This was an awesome match. They brawled everywhere and it was one of my favorite matches on the card.

Sabin vs Shelly pretty good match between those two. I was always a big Shelly fan.

Beer Money, Creed, Lethal vs Abyss and Morgan. This was a solid match involving the three teams. Beer Money always put on a good tag match.

Sewell vs Bashir it was an okay match not bad but would prefer seeing Bashir wrestle the wrestlers not the refs but Sewell had a strong showing.

Sting vs Rhino- This was my favorite match of the night and one of my favorite matches on the 3 DVD Cross The Line Pack. Rhino and Sting had good chemistry. Rhino was a fresh opponent for Sting. Rhino had a great showing and these two put on a great match. It was another big win in the end for Sting.

Unfortunately right now Amazon has this TNA Cross The Line Set as extremely expensive. I have seen the set at a good price on Ebay so I suggest you check there first. Overall this is a great set representing one of the best eras in TNA. Though the young stars of TNA seemed to be pushed aside. It was nice to see guys like Sting, Nash and Booker T get a last big run at the top. This is a must for a Sting fan. I was glad during this time they gave Sting a long title run as he deserved it for all he did for TNA. Cheers and enjoy!",1443225600,,7426,4.115491009681881
8332198,3,B001P5YIQG,"As 2008 closed and 2009 dawned, TNA had a rocky transition from their aborted Samoa Joe championship reign to the Main Event Mafia storyline that would drive the entire promotion for the next year. While the story drive was there, the initial execution was hampered by injuries, unimaginative television and a focus on performers thst made their names in other places beside TNA. I would argue that 2009 eventually became of their better years, but this 3-pack makes it look like TNA was down in the doldrums.

There are three events in this box set, which makes this set worth it for a low price. I say a low price because none of these shows are must see, and I would even contend that two of them are pretty bad.

""Turning Point"" 2008 is the best of the three and features two excellent matches. First, the Motor City Machine Guns fought Beer Money, Inc. over the Tag Team Championship and then Kurt Angle took on Abyss in a jaw-dropping Falls Count Anywhere Match. Both matches are fantastic, and big matches like Kevin Nash/Samoa Joe and Sting/AJ Styles are good enough for repeat viewing. The rest of the card is average but nothing is bad enough to be offensive.

""Final Resolution"" 2008 had a weak undercard with matches like Christy Hemme and Awesome Kong for the Knockouts Title, the cluster Feast or Fired Battle Royal and the downright boring Eric Young/Bashir. Kurt Angle and Rhino put on a solid match, though it was overshadowed by two of the CREEPIEST promos I've heard in wrestling. Seriously, Angle talks about massacring Jarrett for his pleasure while Rhino is obsessed with Jeff's daughters. The main event tag match is very entertaining and covered the MEM's in ring weaknesses well.

""Genesis"" 2009 was TNA hitting a lot of bad luck all at once; Mike Tenay at one point justvlooked at the camera and said, ""Are you kidding me?"" On this one show, Christy Hemme was injured before the event, Samoa Joe was out of action, Kevin Nash came down with a staph infection AND TNA chose to book their Rhino/Sting Title match with the whole ""the good guy was injured, so he's gonna be fighting back from the brink all night."" There were three good matches on the show: an elimination six man tag opener, an X Division Title Tournament Final between Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin, and a genuine MOTY contender in Kurt Angle and Jeff Jarrett's No DQ match. Jarrett and Angle really saved the show with their reckless, bloody brawl!

So, even though the shows aren't very good, there are some great matches to check out. I'll say that I mildly recommend this since it's a pretty cheap deal now. Angle is the obvious star on these events.",1411171200,,2644,4.665236051502146
8332199,5,B001P5YIQG,"This is what I was loving about TNA back in the day. Great plots, wrestlers. Good period! Not that TNA is bad now, just a different period for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.",1398124800,,174,4.46875
8332200,5,B001P5YIQG,i realy enjoyed this set there were many great matches.if there was any draw backs.they  could have setr it up so each match could have been gone to directly.to avoid all the  talking.but there were so many great matches and seeing jeff in a whole new light.was terrific.i own many wrestling dvd's well over 100 and this is in my top 10. I also learned much behind the seens on jeff and other.this is must see for a die hard fan.god bless the show,1239840000,,447,4.309523809523809
8332201,5,B001P5YIQG,"Having attended two of these shows, I will say that this purchase is worth it alone just for Turning Point.

While they did have one stinker in the form of Bashir/Rhino, literally every other match on the show ranged from decent to great.

The opener made me remember the days of old in terms of how good the X Division used to be. Homicide nearly knocked me over with his big moment of the night. Very good choice in opener to get the crowd going ***1/2

The women's tag match was not bad. It was a fun little match to showcase the women but they really need to bring back the quality of the division to how it was when Gail/Kong were feuding. **1/2

As I mentioned above, Rhino/Bashir was pretty lame. Pretty skippable *1/2

Beer Money/MCMG is in my opinion Beer Money's best match since forming. While the ending is something we have seen before, everything up until that point was a blast. ***3/4

Christian's (supposedly) last TNA match was not his finest hour. It certainly was not bad, but the Orlando crowd seemed kind of quiet (although you can see me on the front row popping for everything haha.) Nevertheless though, this was a fine contest but again a bad way for Christian to go out **3/4

Angle/Abyss gets MOTN and was one of TNA's best matches last year. The two of them just killed each other in a very chaotic brawl. This was also Abyss's best match in a long time. Definitely check this one out ****1/4

While I was very disappointed in who in Nash/Joe, this put Joe more over than he had been in a while. Nash came off looking very motivated as the previous reviewer stated, and it signals a possible rematch which is fine with me. ***1/2.

Sting/AJ was a fine main event. Both of them had good chemistry, moreso than Joe and Sting did in my opinion. Sting though annoyed me considering that he is a part of one of the bigger heel factions in company history and yet he was looking for cheers from the crowd. As far as a match goes though, this was fun. ***1/4 - ***1/2

Two thumbs up for the show, since it was their best show in a loooooong time match wise.
===============================================
Final Resolution II (the second of these three shows that I attended) was a decent show. Nothing must see or anything. The show honestly had a ton of filler that was decent, with really three matches standing out. Those three were the Feast or Fired match, Rhino/Angle, and the main event.

This FoF match was a lot better than the one seen at Turning Point 2007. For one, it was a hot opener and the participants seemed more motivated. ***1/2

Angle/Rhino I felt was a bit disappointing as it could have been a lot better. Rhino was hospitalized due to high blood pressure two days before and that could have attributed, but for what this was, it was a fine match. ***

The main event was much better than it had any right to be. Nash again came off looking very motivated as the exchanges between him and AJ or Joe were very good. I personally would not have minded seeing some of the undercard matches cut and having this as elimination style, but we can't all get what we wish for. ***1/2
===============================
Genesis 2009 is another mixed back, but the good is VERY good. This show did have a bit of a plague though because Hemme got injured, keeping her out of the match with Kong (who also ended up getting a back injury.) Nash had to be pulled from the 6-man tag

Shelley/Sabin and Jarrett/Angle II are both ****+ contests that make this show worth watching, with Jarrett/Angle especially being an early MOTYC.

The rest of the show however was a very mixed back.

Another decent show. Go out of your way to watch the two matches that I listed though.
===============================
Again, overall, Turning Point alone makes this a valuable purchase. The other two shows do have some good stuff on them though. Definite buy.",1233705600,,3872,4.541666666666667
8332202,3,B001P5YIQG,"This is another ""Cross The Line"" 3 disc set featuring the Turning Point/Final Resoultion/Genesis PPV's of 2008 into 2009.  The main storyline in TNA at this time was the Main Event Mafia group of former World Champions & established veterans against the TNA Originals of the younger stars who established their name in TNA and later renamed to Frontline when ECW alumni of Rhino & Team 3D joined the group.

Turning Point 2008:
Elimination Match: Eric Young vs. Jay Lethal vs. Consequences Creed vs. Petey Williams vs. Jimmy Rave vs. Homicide vs. Doug Williams, vs. Tanahashi vs. Volador vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Jimmy Rave - Unlike the normal multiman matches on TNA PPV's, this one was under ""lucha libre"" rules where you can not only tag to enter the match but anytime you go outside the ring, anyone else can come into the ring to be the legal man in the match.  This was your typical multiman X division match that you see where there were plenty of spots & fast paced action to make it a solid opener.

Taylor Wilde & Roxxi vs. Awesome Kong & Raisha Saeed - Wilde & Roxxi were looking for revenge for Kong's new associate, Rhaka Khan, turning on Wilde.  This was a solid tag match overall but nothing special.

Rhino vs. Sheik Abdul Bashir - Unfortunally, this is one of those matches were was concentrated more on what was going on elsewhere than what was in the ring as Scott Hall & the Insane Clown Posse were on the outside causing a scene in the audience that distracted everyone from Bashir to the audience chanting ""Razor"" towards Hall.  The match itself was average but you can tell everyone was upset about what happened on the outside to the point where Rhino just walked off after the match.

TNA Tag Team Champions Beer Money Inc. vs. Motor City Machine Guns - This was the first ""above average"" match of the night and fun match to watch at that.  Great tag team wrestling that picked up the pace in the end.

TNA Legends Champion Booker T vs. Christian Cage - This first match involing the Main Event Mafia here as weeks earlier, Booker T debuted the new TNA Legends Championship and this was the first title defense with the stipulation that if Cage loses, he must join the Main Event Mafia.  I have nothing against Booker T & Christian Cage but this was exactly the type of match that you would expect from these two based off their previous series of matches in WWE.  It was a solid match but nothing above average.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Abyss vs. Kurt Angle - These two should have been arrested after this match because they stole the show here (bad joke, I know).  You had chairshots, brawling through the crowd, going through the stage, and Kurt Angle performing such eye-catching moves like his running flip dive off the stage & moonsault onto the steel chair.  Look out for the ending where Abyss falls off the scaffold through the spanish table because he could have been seriously injured if he misjudged the table/fall by a few feet.  Again, match of the night here & Abyss' best showing since his return to TNA earlier in the year.

Samoa Joe vs. Kevin Nash - For the first time since probably his Starrcade match against Goldberg, this is the most motivated I've seen Kevin Nash in a match.  This was a ""student vs. teacher"" setup with the story that Joe was just too much for Nash to the point where he had to keep cheating to get an advantage.  This couldn't follow the previous match but this wasn't bad at all & a better match than what you would expect from Kevin Nash at this stage in his career.

TNA Champion Sting vs. A.J. Styles - This was a disappointment to me as it seemed like the match didn't equal the months worth of hype it had & along with the fact that both men were capable of so much more than what we saw.  It was good & solid but it wasn't a ""main event"" calibur match...and the ending which came off real ""flat"" didn't help either.

Without a doubt the highlights here were the Kurt Angle/Abyss match, Beer Money vs. MCMG, and the Nash/Joe match for those Kevin Nash fans.

Final Resolution 2008:
Feast Or Fired Match: L.A.X. vs. Jay Lethal vs. Curry Man vs. Shark Boy vs. Consequences Creed vs. B.G. James vs. Motor City Machine Guns vs. Rock N' Rave Infection vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Cute Kip - For those who didn't see the first one last year, a ""Feast Or Fired"" match is TNA's version of WWE's ""Money In The Bank"" where there are 4 briefcases hung up on a different pole with 3 of them containing a title shot at a championship (World, X Division, Tag Team) and the 4th one being the ""Fired"" case which would result in being fired from TNA.  The rules are that you have to exit the ring with the briefcase in order to claim it.  This was better than the trainwreck I saw last year but it's your typical TNA multiman battle royal type of match but keep watching after the match for what happened between Broash & the Gunz as that was a running story throughout the night that later ended with the TNA debut of someone you may recognize from their video game.
Now for those keeping up with what happened with the cases afterwards...Homicide won an X Division Title shot, Hernandez won a TNA Title shot, Jay Lethal won a Tag Team Title shot, and Curry Man was fired.

Taylor Wilde, O.D.B., Roxxi vs. Beautiful People & Sharmell - As part of a pre-match deal, if Sharmell's team wins then the Beautiful People will get Booker T's locker room.  This was just an average match that was more of ""character driven/put a storyline over"" revolving around O.D.B. & Sharmell.

X Division Champion Sheik Abdul Bashir vs. Eric Young - Over the past few weeks, TNA did a big character change with Young in that he's no longer TNA's version of WWE's ""Eugene"" character and became the more serious wrestler like we used to see in the old days of Team Canada.  A good solid match between these two but this was more about the current issue between Bashir & referee Shane Sewell that really came to ahead after the match.

TNA Knockouts Champion Awesome Kong vs. Christy Hemme - This was another ""put storyline over"" match as it was real short & only there to set Hemme up as the new ""Gail Kim"" by taking the fight to Kong but the match itself was nothing special.

TNA Tag Team Champions Beer Money Inc. vs. Abyss & Matt Morgan - Sorry but I'm just not impressed with the Morgan & Abyss team so I just felt that Beer Money carried that team to a watchable but nothing special match.

Rhino vs. Kurt Angle w/Mick Foley as the Special Enforcer - After months of being stuck in opening/midcard status, Rhino gets a renewed push here against Kurt Angle with the stipulation that if Angle wins, he'll finally get his rematch against Jeff Jarrett at the next PPV.  A good solid match that went back & forth between both guys.  The only downfall I can say here was the Al Snow appearence to distract Foley & play off the fact that Mick Foley made tons of money at Snow's expense.....which is the exact feud WWE did almost a decade earlier.  Just as quick as Snow appeared, he also hasn't been seen in TNA since.

Main Event Mafia (TNA Champion Sting, Kevin Nash, Booker T, Scott Steiner) vs. TNA Frontline (A.J. Styles, Samoa Joe, Team 3D) - The TNA Championship was on the line with the stipulation that if anyone in Frontline got the victory then A.J. Styles would become the new TNA Champion.  This was a fun tag match which everyone looked strong, fast paced, and everyone got their opportunities in.  What's probably more interesting than the match itself is just watch what happens with Sting & the rest of the MEM afterwards.

Genesis 2009:
Genesis is one of those PPV's where anything that could go wrong DID go wrong.  Due to injuries to Christy Hemme, Awesome Kong, and Kevin Nash (for those keeping track, that's the 4th TNA PPV he's missed due to injury), the card had to be changed.  As it rains it pours because TNA ran an angle where Rhino was attacked by the MEM in his hotel earlier (two months after WWE did the same angle with Jeff Hardy at Survivor Series) causing his match with Sting to be the weakest & shortest match on the entire card...but as if that match couldn't have gotten any worse, the crowd cheered Sting the entire time & turned on Rhino.  This PPV was also advertised around Mick Foley's return to the ring in the six man tag but due to Nash's injury, Cute Kip replaced Nash with the match not really picking up until it was turned into a ""Hardcore Rules"" match.  Foley's performance reminded me of the match he had with Carlito (anyone remember that?) where his performance didn't equal the hype around his return.  The only positives I can say about this PPV is that two matches gave this PPV some replay value in that Kurt Angle & Jeff Jarrett stole the show with their brawl that was without a doubt the match of the night & one that I felt topped their Bound For Glory match...which if anyone saw was a great match as well.  The other match is the X Division Championship finals between the Motor City Machine Guns that was just a great match overall that's been missing from the X division in a long time to the point even made Don West say that, ""this reminds me of A.J. Styles & Jerry Lynn from the early days.""  The rest of the matches on this card (O.D.B./Roxxi/Taylor Wilde vs. Saeed/Bolt/Kham, Sewell/Bashir, L.A.X./Young vs. Dutt/Rave/Kiyoshi, Beer Money vs. Morgan/Abyss vs. Lethal/Creed) were just average or as good as you would expect but nothing special.

In the end, Turning Point didn't have a bad match on it, was solid with the wrestling, and did it's job in establishing the Main Event Mafia as the dominate group in TNA.  Final Resolutionwas more about establishing their future storylines (Angle/Jarrett, Hemme/Kong, Bashir/Sewell, Feast Or Fired) while still pushing their current ones (MEM vs. Frontline).  Genesis has some solid average matches but came off as a filler more than anything due to all the injury problems, the World Title angle, and the crowd being dead weight for most of the night.  Overall, your getting 3 PPV's for the price of one here so it's something worth picking up.",1233446400,,10090,4.517032967032967
