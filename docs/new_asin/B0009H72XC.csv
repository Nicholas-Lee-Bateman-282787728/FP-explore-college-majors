8060623,5,B0009H72XC,This movie is about a woman who is a serial killer - but doesn't know it. It is so scary because while you watch her go about her normal life the narrator is keepign you up to date on her past so you are constantly waiting for her to freak out and kill someone. This is a really scary film - and not appropriate for children - but for adults who want an halloween night scare will love it. It is just creepy and thought provoking.,1154044800,2,430,4.011627906976744
8060624,5,B0009H72XC,"You know the guy who does the million dollar sweepstakes ads on television - Ed McMahn? Who knew that he used to do weird horor films back in the 1950s? This is by far the strangest scary movie I've ever seen. It's definatly an art film - nothing is coherent and the  plot is narrated, while none of the actors talk - ever. The point is that it is a film about madness, so it tries to make you feel like you are insane as well. This makes it very, very scary - even though it does not have any of the gore you see in modern horror pictures.",1148256000,2,540,3.9541284403669725
8060625,5,B0009H72XC,"""I thought I'd seen the best of them, but Daughter of Horror from A2ZCDS takes the ribbon. What disturbed me the most is that this could well be the story of many anonymous maniacs on the loose today. The depth of psychological insight into a highly disturbed mind is surprising in such an early film. I would not recommend it to all age groups, but it is definitely a priceless adult watching experience.""",1146528000,2,406,4.575342465753424
