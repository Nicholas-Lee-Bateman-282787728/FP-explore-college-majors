7993507,5,B00009W356,"This film could have easily become the kind of saccharine, predictable, feel-good entertainment so routinely produced by Hollywood, but instead it takes its somewhat familiar story and imposes a good strong dose of the real world upon it. The Yorkshire scenery is beautiful, and the actors are absolutely terrific, with the child actors deserving special credit for bringing exceptionally honest performances to their roles. The entire film feels so rooted in reality that the large dollop of mysticism added to the plot doesn't feel at all out of place, and makes the ending (I won't spoil it) feel a perfect fit with the rest of the film.
This is a tremendous little film, and definitely deserves to be in the 'hidden gem' category.
