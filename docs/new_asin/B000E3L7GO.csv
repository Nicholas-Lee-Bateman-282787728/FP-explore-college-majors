These days, children's cartoons are filled with violent and even sexual themes just look at tom and jerry. The little prince remains a classic and with its stories of humanity, love, friendship, and faith. I highly recommend it to all parents and their children.",1452988800,,365,4.545454545454546
8330711,2,B000E3L7GO,"This is a 72 minute DVD that has cartoon stories based on the character of the Little Prince. There is no pilot or airplane, Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry did not write these stories. Despite that and the poor sound quality the National Education Association has put their stamp of approval on this.

The 3 stories tell of the Little Prince who lives on an asteroid and rides on comets to visit planets. In one he meets a girl who herds sheep, another he visits space pioneers and in another befriends a stray dog.

There are no subtitles; however you can have the episodes in Spanish and English. The colour is nice, but the sound is terrible. The narration is fast and the sound is muddy and hard to understand. Part of the narration is done in a French accent. My grandson found it so hard to understand he lost interest.",1375228800,,826,4.5369127516778525
