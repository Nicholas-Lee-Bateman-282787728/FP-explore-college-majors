I will recomend it to friends that enjoy sports movies...",1232928000,,251,4.229166666666667
3042064,5,6303439136,Ernie Davis' story is a true inspiration and should be considered just as much of a breakthrough in sports history as Jackie Robinson. The movie itself was very emotional and I thought it did a great job of retelling a great story.,1232668800,,231,4.523809523809524
3042065,5,6303439136,"Note to Amazon.com: where'd the first review I wrote about this disc (and film) go?

Let me get the technical details covered first for those that worry more about that stuff than about the quality of the story in a movie.  The Express, at least on Blu-ray disc, features absolutely stunningly impressive video quality.  Even the most picky of viewers would likely call the picture quality here 'reference' level.  It really is that good and rises to almost match the quality of the story that is in the film.  The same can be said of the audio quality which is equally impressive.

Note that I said that the picture and audio quality almost rises to the quality of the story, and yet I also called them reference quality.  If you've picked up on that description then hopefully you'll have figured out my opinion of the story and can probably guess that I can't recommend this film highly enough.

Sadly, the film didn't do that well while it was out in theatrical release, earning back less than 1/4 of what was reportedly spent on it.  I think that all says more about how people perceive sports oriented movies than anything else, as it seems people instead want thrillers, slashers and films in other genres to spend their entertainment money on.

I don't want to spoil the film for anyone that hasn't seen it, but will say it's based on actual events and a real person.  If you haven't heard of Ernie Davis, don't feel bad as many people probably have no idea of his significance in history.  Do watch the film, learn about Ernie Davis, and perhaps spend more time later learning more about him.  You'll be glad you did.",1232409600,2,1626,4.58477508650519
3042066,4,6303439136,"""The Express"" is about the life of Ernie Davis, a highly talented football player who followed, literally, in the footsteps of Jim Brown.  Ernie, like Jim Brown before him, was recruited to play football at Syracuse University.

This movie follows Earnie's life before, during, and after his time at Syracuse.  It chronicles his successes and failures, his personal challenges, and shows how he met those challenges, including racial prejudice, intolerance, and bigotry.

Ernie Davis is played by Rob Brown, an actor recognized for his earlier work in the films ""Finding Forrester"" and ""Coach Carter"".

This film is clearly worth a 5-star rating for the sports enthusiast, but it tends to have less appeal for other viewers.  The acting is solid, but not outstanding.  The music is good, and the storyline is compelling.

My 14 year old football-playing son thinks this film is the greatest!

So, 4 solid stars for a good movie and story that deserves a place along side other memorable sports films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miracle-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0001US66E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miracle (Widescreen Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remember-the-Titans-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000056VP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remember the Titans (Widescreen Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoosiers/dp/0792843592/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoosiers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brian-s-Song/dp/B00004TJQJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brian's Song</a>.",1232409600,,1665,7.956756756756757

3042068,5,6303439136,"There has been well-documented commentary about the producers of The Express having taken liberties with some of the facts.  While this is true, none of those liberties really obscure or confuse the Ernie Davis story. If you want to see a more factual presentation of the Ernie Davis story, check out the 30-minute documentary about Davis in ESPN's SportCentury series.  It is very well done, too.  You'll find that in this feature film, there is not much significant straying from fact.

This was an excellent film.  In the theater where I saw the film, the audience was so into the movie, particularly the football action, that some folks actually cheered when Davis would make a good run or score a touchdown.  The director and actors did a great job of hooking the viewer into the intensity of the games. Great story without getting too hung up on the national politics of the time.  Highly recommended.",1231372800,35,907,4.812903225806451
3042069,3,6303439136,"This movie does a great job in portraying how things were in the late 50s but it takes too many liberties with the historical facts.  First,  Ernie Davis was striken with lukemeia while preparing for the College All Star Game in Chicago,  not the Coaches All Ameican Game as the movie shows.  Ernie played in that game in Buffalo and was booed by the crowed for not signing with the Bills, who offered him more money than the Cleveland Browns did.  Second,  in the flash back scene showing Jim Brown signing his first pro contract with the Browns in 1957,  Art Modell's name is mentioned.  Modell did not own the team then,  he bought the team four years later.  Lastly, the movie shows the Syracuse team travelling to Dallas for the 1960 Cotton Bowl on a bus.  I find it hard to believe that a team playing for the national championship even back then took a bus for a trip half way across the country.  Still, however,  this is a good movie for the story it tells.",1227744000,5,966,4.389830508474576

3042075,2,6303439136,"hello,
  having grown up in the same time period, but on the west coast, there wasn't much of the prejudice as in the south and east. football will always be a national sport and stars will always be on the fore front.  understanding human kindness and acceptance was the first step in being accepted in all of society.  there are still barriers for a lot of people and that is awful, being that we are in 2017.  but for the majority of the people those barriers have changed for the better.  this movie was pretty accurate and was extremely fun to watch the real life scenes for those in the east and south.  the east and south temperament?  not our cup of tea, that is for sure.

3042092,5,6303439136,"My previous greatest football movies are two <ANY GIVEN SUNDAY><REMEMBER THE TITANS>. Well that just have been changed the moment I saw this movie.
You better grab this bluray cause it's just stupidly 5.11$ and that price is just redunculous. The visual/ audio quality is top notch and you won't ever go back to dvd again if you watch this one. And most of all this is the best sports movie ever in my life. NA, let me rephrase, one of the best.
Of course there is <ROCKY> unbeatable film and all.

The story is about this Afro -African guy who dies at the age of so young 23 who shines so bright for such a short time as a foogball player.
Behind him was another great coach Nennis Quaid a white guy a tough bastard but is ok dude whom everyone will fall in love if got to know him well.

Most of all the camera usage is just stunning and you will die for it. It almost remnded me of the car race movie <RUSH> the best movie that has the best camera work ever. Yes this movie was that good.

And then There is Dennis Quaid the great actor that will blow your mind. He is a passionate coach who wants to make this new comer Rob Brown somwwhat invisible but looking back is humorous but charming to look at. Not to flamboyant but stand out enough to want to see again and again kind of actor.
And also is the great beauty Nicole Beharie a chocolate coated SADE kind of girl whom you cannot deny but to fall in love.
But most of all the game sequences are pure stunning to look at.
True heartbeat that you will feel like sitting at the edge of the seat.
The there is this moment when the great player finds out that he is having this desease that he cannot beat.
He's been throught so many things for his position for chist sake.
The prejusice from White people the money the support, the everything beyond.

Now that he is playing well, he is facing death.

But then again he's got nothing to loose.
There comes aglong another new comer saying you are my dream my hero.
He says don't be another me. You be another you. Be a great guy not pretend to be another me. Don't chase my shadow because it's gonna be another shadow that you cannot keep. Something like that.

He was a great guy a great player that you should remember and this movie made him as such.",1472601600,,2257,4.200923787528868

3042200,2,6303439136,"Ernie Davis as I remember reading about him in the late 1950's and beyond was a great man. As I knew Darrell Royal he was also a great man and both were great in different ways. The film on Davis's life does not show or present an understanding of Ernie. Though not intended to depict Royal, the movie is distorted there as well as much of the events in the movie. Yes, we take historical events and re-write them to make some point and in so doing, we fictionalize history as well as unfairly cast some cloak of untruth and error on a person's or culture's life. The base is there was and is, sadly again, prejudice and bias in our culture, Texas and elsewhere. That is a negative and to picture it, for me, and I emphasize for me, as fiction to make a point lowers the reader, viewer, participant to a non thinking robot, or better, puppet, to be manipulated without thinking or using reason as a base to understand what is reality. To make a statement of racism's existence by distorting and fictionalizing events, and events that reflect a person's character in an erroneous and clearly in error manner is a .....is a not!!!! There are five primary ways by which we know: the way of authority, empiricism, rationalism, mysticism and revelation. The producers, writers, et of the film did a disservice to Davis, Brown, and many other persons of this film in order to make a point ....of was it to sell tickets?",1382572800,,1413,4.501945525291829

3042233,2,6303439136,"Oh boy! Another sports movie (sarcastic tone implied). The Express (2008) is an important story wrapped in an atrociously obvious ball of sports movie clichs, unrealistic portrayal of history, and characters more one sided than Fox News.
We start out in what looks to be heaven, but is supposed to look like a Philadelphia suburb in the 1940's. For some strange reason, the colors are brighter, grass is greener and cars, houses and people are shinier and more attractive, and from what I gather, everyone is rich and World War 2 never happened. Our lead, Ernie Davis, is a 'poor' kid who gets discovered playing football in high school and ends up playing for Syracuse University and becoming the first African American to win the Heisman, and encountering the race issues in a 1950's civil rights era America. Although the shiny, made-for-TV feel of the entire thing is unrealistic and inaccurate, it is a commonality in feel good conventional flicks like this, so this is not where I lay my grievances.
 I think what bothered me most with the movie was the almost constant state of ignorance our lead character, Ernie Davis, was in. For an African American who grew up in the Jim Crow 40's and 50's, he is pretty appalled at the racism he encounters. He walks by a store owner, says ""how do you do, fine day isn't it?"" or something along those lines, and is utterly shocked that the white man put his head down and walks in without a response. Had he been in the south, he should have been utterly appalled that he wasn't lynched. Even in the north, where this event took place, prancing around town with that smirk of innocence is not normal behavior for an African American of that time, and I'm certain that the real Ernie Davis was would be well aware of that fact. Similarly, another example would be the ""white girl speech"" in which the head coach subtly fills Davis in on what shouldn't come as such a surprise. The fact of the matter is that multi-racial dating did not become socially acceptable until the late 70's, or some could argue it still isn't. So for a black man in the 50's to find this unacceptable is historically inaccurate. This is an issue throughout the film, and perhaps one that gets even more prevalent, when Davis and his African American friends are subject to segregation in Texas, and once again, surprised. However this was not the end of what I disliked about the film.
 The pan zoom shot of the trophy case and the athlete as the soft, slow trumpet overcomes the shot, the star player magically returning to the game despite a serious injury, the locker room fights, and the last minute scoring for the win. Sound familiar? Although this is a given in sports movies, especially the classics, the clear lack of original writing is noteworthy.
In addition, it seems that ever character in the film is far too simple. What I mean to say is, the director creates this polarization throughout the movie between good and evil. Everyone either has a heat of gold or the antichrist. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground between the issues. The Deep South is depicted as a dark, terrifying place where everyone white person is racist, and every black person is an innocent victim. Although generalizations such as this may be both relevant a for the most part accurate, it is the only side of the story we see in the film. This presents what one could almost call a simplified dumbed down version of the civil rights movement.
One thing I can say about ""The Express"" is that it looks quite nice, with two or three really beautifully done shots. Add that to a fine performance by Dennis Quaid as head coach, and the movie has some legs; short, stubby legs. As far as portraying the actual events, I couldn't find any mistakes, so it is only lacking in truth in the conventional sense, in capturing the essence 'feel' of a time.
The fact is that this movie isn't made to be realistic, nor is it made to thoroughly educate the general public about the civil rights movement. It is made to entertain, and that is something that this high-budget piece of consumerism can handle, for the most part. If you are looking for a classic tale of 'feel-good,' good vs. evil movie that dumbs down and over polishes history, this is a movie for you; if you want the substance, form, realism and intellectual controversy of the actual civil rights movement, you must not be familiar with how Hollywood works.",1354752000,,4425,4.635668789808917

Rob Brown as Davis captures the courage and dignity of Ernie, whether battling racism or fighting leukemia. Several of Ernie's teammates from Syracuse were interviewd about the movie and although they praised Dennis Quaid's performance as their ex-coach they were dismayed at the scene depicting the W.V.-S.U. game, in which Coach pulled Davis, leading to words between them. NEVER HAPPENED and did not portray the player-coach relationship accurately. The special features with interviews with Jim Brown, and teammat John Brown and other teammates are a nice bonus.

3042238,5,6303439136,"Most sports movies based on real life situations and events are a mixed bag, with more good than bad, see ""We Are Marshall"" for a great example. ""Remember The Titans"" was one of the better ones to tackle the issues of racism and bigotry in the '50's and '60's, where even with the PG rating you could get at least a sampling of the tension and drama that a lot of people went through in that time. ""The Express"" deals with a young man by the name of Ernie Davis (played by Rob Brown ""Finding Forrester""  who has grown up facing all kinds of racism, bigotry, hate and whatnot throughout his childhood into his teens and to his days at Syracuse College where a running back by the name of Jim Brown (any big time football fan will know this name) has just signed with the pro team Cleveland Browns but didn't win the famed college trophy The Heisman.

Ernie has always been fast even as a kid, which is shown in a fantastic opening sequence with a young Ernie outrunning a bunch of white kids, there's scenes with Davis overcoming his stuttering issue thanks to his grandpa encouraging and supporting him. Once he gets to Syracuse the coach (Dennis Quaid, ""The Rookie"") sees him as the next Jim Brown but that doesn't mean he doesn't push his players as Davis harder than ever and expect nothing less than the very best.

As far as an accurate story I admit I'm not too familiar with Ernie Davis' story, but as far as the era I feel the filmmakers captured the feel and look of it very well. The hate and scorn black people received during this time probably can't ever be fully captured on film but for a PG rated sports flick ""The Express"" does a more than admiral job telling a great story. The football footage mixes archive clips with movie footage which does make for a great experience though the football aspect is only part of the flick as the real story is how Ernie had a never say die attitude.

One great part of the film is a brawl that breaks out during the 1960 Cotton Bowl vs. Texas where the racism just boils over on the field just before halftime. I'm sure there are some liberties taken with the true story, though those who know how it ended know it didn't turn out well, but that doesn't prevent this movie from being one great sports flick that keeps your attention throughout its running time. **** out of 4 stars.",1347235200,,2337,4.390300230946882

3042240,3,6303439136,"""The Express: The Ernie Davis Story"" is an inspirational football movie LOOSELY based on the true story of Ernie Davis, the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy - following his 1961 season at Syracuse University. Davis is played by Rob Brown.

The movie, unfortunately, rather than focusing on Ernie Davis, splits the focus and ends up being not only about Davis but a lot about his football coach, Ben Schwartzwalder, played by Dennis Quaid. Both parts are played well but since this is ""The Ernie Davis Story,"" I would have preferred more about Davis.

I would have enjoyed finding out more about how Davis FELT about the times he was living in.  The movie takes place during the height of the civil rights movement.  Davis was also the first African-American - nationally - to become a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu Fraternity, a Jewish fraternity, while at Syracuse University.  He was also the first African-American to be the first overall draft pick, going to the Redskins in the 1962 NFL draft and then being traded to the Browns.

Davis was a fantastic running back, which the movie does show.  He also died tragically at 23 years old of leukemia, before playing his first pro game.

The movie was worth watching - as a sports movie, as long as you aren't overly concerned by details; and as an inspirational story.  It's a tearjerker so be prepared.

3042242,4,6303439136,"Gary Fleder's ""The Express"" just adds to the ever-increasing list of sports movies centred around a hero overcoming adversary. The producers successfully managed to combine the true story of athletic achievement and overcoming racism to create a melodramatic movie that we've all seen before.

Although ""The Express"" doesn't stand out and is entirely predictable, it definitely appeals to the masses. Ernie Davis played by Rob Brown, is shown as a promising football player while growing up who goes on to play for Syracuse University and eventually gets drafted by the Cleveland Browns. During his time at Syracuse, Davis leads his team to win the school's first national football championship and becomes the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy.

All of the actors portrayed their characters as likeable and charismatic although almost all of their roles can be found in every other dramatic sport film. Ernie's white teammates are rude and intolerant of Ernie and start a number of locker room fights while Dennis Quaid's character is the harsh coach with a good heart who sticks with Davis until the very end. Although the numerous shots of football games along with fast paced music keep the audience's attention, the storyline is extremely predictable and difficult to get invested in.

""The Express"" has excellent cinematography with plenty of scenes of the real football games that Ernie Davis was playing in along with re-enacted footage that will leave you gaping at the screen. However, cinematography can only go so far in telling the story and what the director, Gary Fleder, excelled at in the technicalities of filming, he fell short at with portraying Ernie Davis' story in a way that moved viewers. The concept of Davis becoming a star in an environment where he was constantly facing discrimination is undoubtedly a powerful one. This coupled with Davis' diagnosis of leukaemia alone has the potential of an extremely powerful film. However, viewers never got to see how Ernie evolved as a person and how he felt about not being able to join his team at hotels and restaurants because of the colour of his skin. Ernie's diagnosis was also not focused on until around the last 20 minutes of the movie and even then, the tone of the movie didn't match the direction that the story was heading in, one where Davis died at only 23 years old.

Scenes that focused on the racism prevalent in Davis' life were mostly inaccurate. It was definitely something that Davis and the Syracuse team had to deal with but the screaming southern Texans that were shown at the 1960 Cotton Bowl Classic were a product of dramatic licence. One of the first games shown was between Syracuse and West Virginia University during which West Virginia team members and referees both acted with obvious bias against the Orangemen. Film Journal International critic Frank Lovece commented on the scene by saying that it ""veers remarkably toward outright slander."" In reality, the Syracuse coach, Ben Schwartzwalder, was revered at WVU and the Syracuse quarterback Dick Easterly said that the scene was completely fictitious. The pivotal Cotton Bowl scene was also inaccurate with its representation of the racial tension in the stadium. Bobby Lackey who was quarterback of the University of Texas team said, ""...they were making up stories to try and sell more movie tickets.""

Not only were the football games inaccurate but it can also be argued that the entire movie did not accurately represent Ernie Davis' life at all. John Brown, Davis' friend, teammate, and roommate was asked whether or not the film was a genuine portrayal of Ernie and Brown said, ""...in short, no.""

""The Express"" is a well made Hollywood take on how Ernie Davis went on to become an inspiration to thousands and is perfect for those who won't mind watching yet another adaptation of every football movie in existence.",1332720000,9,3897,5.015455950540958

3042248,4,6303439136,"Bottom-Line: Overall ""The Express"" succeeds at both educating and inspiring and that is never a bad thing!

""The Express: The Ernie Davis Story (2008),"" opens with the following narration: ""Twenty-one lines, five yards apart-that's a football game. But there are other lines that run deeper, and wider, that aren't part of any game."" As a Black American male who grew up in the seventies, partly in the North, partly in the South of this nation, I know all too well the meaning of the subtext.

But my experiences as traumatic and life-altering as they were to me, were nothing, nothing compared to those of Black American men and women who scarified much in the decade leading up to the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. And their courage helped fill in the deep racial divide that so used to stain--and still stains--this nation in rutty ugliness.  They did it by achieving when and where they weren't supposed to, showing the nation and the world that Black Americans were--and are--every bit the equal of White's and, in some cases, better!  Such is the case with Ernie Davis and ""The Express"" is his tale.

Story-Line

Directed by (Gary Fleder ~ October Road), ""The Express"" opens on an all too familiar scene: two Black American boys (cousins) are confronted by a gaggle of White's demanding the spoils of their labor: collecting glass bottles for the deposits.  One boy hops a train to escape, the other (Ernie Davis ~ Justin Martin) eludes the boys with a combination of slick moves and lightning speed.

Flash forward: Ernie Davis (Rob Brown ~ Stop Loss, Treme), nicknamed the ""The Elmira Express,"" is an all-star running back for his Elmira, NY high school and is being recruited by Syracuse University coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid ~ The Parent Trap, Flight of the Phoenix, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra) and Jim Brown (Darrin Dewitt Henson ~ Soul Food, Stomp The Yard, Lincoln Heights) to play for the Syracuse Orangeman; he accepts.

Thus begins an odyssey that will eventually see Ernie Davis win the famed Heisman Trophy in 1961.

My Thoughts

""The Express: The Ernie Davis Story"" is an inspiration, how could it not be taking place as it did just as the American Civil Rights movement was kicking into high gear, and Ernie Davis was one of the faces of a young Black America hungry for change.  Racial equality, true justice and equivalency were the touchstones of the movement and Ernie Davis was one of the symbols Black Americans were proud to point to as a representation of the race as a whole.

Well-acted and directed, ""The Express: The Ernie Davis Story"" at times made me smile, made me angry, made me proud and made me shed a tear.  Like I said the movie is inspirational and moving.  Lead Rob Brown turned in an outstanding performance and showcases the all too under-utilized talent Black American actors bring to theatrical table.  Two thumbs up to the Denis Quaid as well for a masterful depiction of a typical college football coach.

Here are some thing you do not know about Ernie Davis; I know I did know them before watching this movie: he was a two-time first-team All-America running back at Syracuse University; he led his team to an undefeated season and a national championship, the first for Syracuse University; most importantly, he, Ernie Davis, was the first black man to earn college football's most coveted award, the oft-revered Heisman Trophy.

These are the fact young American children, black or white, red, or brown, do not learn about in school, not even at the college level unless you attend a Black College or University, or take an African American studies class.  If you are a Black American child you are taught that your ancestors used to be slaves and little else; good luck trying to find achievements by Black Americans in a Texas state history book!  It takes movies like ""The Express"", Rosewood (1997), Separate But Equal (1991), Roots (1977) and others to tell the unvarnished history of Black achievement in America.

Not that ""The Express"" did not take license with the truth; e.g. the team get together at the local rib joint after the Cotton Bowl purportedly never took place.  And the movie was over-dramatic at times.  But overall ""The Express"" succeeds at both educating and inspiring and that is never a bad thing!",1293580800,2,4309,4.808943089430894

3042255,4,6303439136,"Based on a true story, The Express follows the bittersweet yet extraordinary life of Ernie Davis (played by Rob Brown), the first African American to win the prestigious Heisman Trophy in the Civil rights era. His fight for equality and respect forever changed the face of American sports and his story continues to inspire new generations.

 This docudrama begins with Davis as a stuttering youth, growing up in a small coal town outside of Pittsburgh with his grandfather, affectionally known as Pops whom he is very close to.  Ernie later moves to Elmira with his mother, where he joins a small football league. With Ernie's extraordinary skills, he is eventually sought after by 50 colleges which was a huge feat for a black person during the civil rights era. An era when Black players were unwelcome in the South. Ernie is soon called by coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid) and football legend Jim Brown (Darrin Dewitt Henson) who make Ernie part of their team, the Syracuse Orangemen. Ernie Davis leads the team to an undefeated season. Despite all the racism he faces at nearly every point of his life, determined Ernie becomes the first African American to win the Heisman trophy and goes on to play for the Cleveland Browns.

 The Express isn't just about football; it shows black pride and determination despite the racism. An important scene in the movie that portrays this determination, is when the team travels to West Virginia University to play the mountaineers. The coach removes Ernie from the game because he fears that if he scored a touchdown, the audience would react violently. However, Ernie refuses to be removed from the game and scores a touch down. Afterwards the coach and Ernie have an angry confrontation where the coach states "" If I let you carry that goal all the way across the board, we might not get on the bus in one piece, thats how it works around here."" Ernie, angered by this statement tells the coach to respect him as an equal part of the team and not give in to racism.  As the growing civil rights movement divided the country in the 60's, Davis became a symbol for achievement that transcended race. Davis refused to flinch from others' prejudices and achieved all his goals.  He was referred to by John F. Kennedy as an "" Outstanding young man of great character who served as an inspiration to young people of this country.""

 Having received many positive remarks, critics have also pointed out some flaws. In a USA Today article by Mike Clark, The Express is said to have ""mostly conventional storytelling."" The movie fails to recognize the rest of Davis' life. It doesn't bring up the fact that after being drafted by pro football in 1961, Davis developed leukemia and died in 1963 never having played a pro game. This shows that The Express attempted to only present the happy sides of Davis' life and disregard the rest.
 Also, according to journalists and film critics there are some historical inaccuracies.  The locations shown in the movie are fictitious. The Express changed the location of where the games actually took place. Frank Lovece, a Film Journal International critic stated ""That game is falsely shown as taking place at WVU's Mountaineer Field"" in Morgantown, West Virginia, rather than at Syracuse's own Archbold Stadium."" As a result, the film has drawn the ire of many West Virginians, including the state's governor, Joe Manchin, and university officials.  A similar mistake was also made at the scene in the finished film, whose original script didn't involve West Virginia. This scene was supposed to depict a 1958 game at the Tar Heels Stadium in North Carolina. This is completely inaccurate. In the season of 1958 Davis was still a freshman and therefore didn't play on the Orangemen's varsity team. Syracuse didn't even play North Carolina until 1995.  As far as the sequence of plays and scores go, The Express shows them completely out of order. But these are just minor inaccuracies which don't effect the movie or its reputation much.
 Referencing the inaccuracy of the location of the game, Frank Lovece, a Journal International critic stated that, ""The Express plays fast and loose with the historical record, and while dramatization is a given in biopics, these scenes here veer remarkably toward outright slander.""
 All together, The Express is an extremely inspirational movie. This docudrama can strengthen anyones determination to achieve their goals. It can also teach people to stand up for their beliefs despite what others think.  Despite the historical inaccuracies, The Express is a solid touchdown.",1275782400,6,4602,4.957142857142857

Yes, I knew he was the first African-American to win the Heisman--and he won it when the civil rights issue was at its zenith.  And yes, I knew he died tragically young, but had no idea leukemia claimed him at age 23, before he even got to play a down in the NFL.  And I did not know the Cleveland Browns, who drafted him to play alongside fellow Syracuse legend Jim Brown, retired his jersey number.  But I know all of this now, thanks to watching THE EXPRESS, a tribute to Ernie Davis and his collegiate career.  Sure, it's a little sappy and reeks of melodramatic cliches at times, but overall this is a very moving story about a young man of strong moral fiber fighting not only tacklers on the field, but a society determined to keep him at second class status.

THE EXPRESS features a superb cast, including Rob Brown in the lead role.  Brown plays the young Syracuse superstar with calm demeanor and resolute determination; other actors, given the racial tensions of the setting, might have been tempted to go over the top, but Brown keeps the lid on.  I thoroughly enjoyed Dennis Quaid as gruff head coach Ben Schwartzwalder--a man who must go on a personal journey of his own, as he discovers he's not as open and tolerant as he originally believes.  And I really liked Darrin Dewitt Henson playing the proud, yet always defiant, Jim Brown.  The football scenes--particularly the 1960 Cotton Bowl against an angry Texas team--are gritty and realistic; sports fans will enjoy the action, while everyone else will enjoy the humanity THE EXPRESS so aptly depicts.

This is a gripping biography about a young man who never got the chance to reap the rewards for his hard work and perseverance through a time when this county didn't see blacks as people. It's hard to believe this was only 60 years ago! It's really appalling how we treated certain people in those days and it's only been in the last 20 years when we have even begun to put this practice in the garbage where it belongs.

Yet, not one of the aforementioned presumptive deficiencies serve to mitigate my personal contention it remains a worthwhile movie for any real fan of college sports  and manages to effectively convey the spirit of socio-cultural dictates of the represented era .  It is an absolutely enjoyable drama based on the life Ernie Davis, not a documentary of the life of Ernie Davis.

Davis was not a trailblazer nor was he alone in absorbing the ignorant, racist invectives and missiles launched in the direction of blacks from nearly every nook and cranny of an America gradually but at glacial-like pace being moved in the direction of a more pluralistic society. From most accounts and most assuredly based on the depiction in this movie, he was an impressive individual and athlete who by virtue of his athleticism ascended to the status of role model and hero for legions of people but tragically was afflicted with leukemia and died at the much too tender age of 23.

Portrayed with subtle intensity by Rob Brown and continually juxtaposed with his college coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid, in a role where significantly more complexity was exhibited than he is typically given credit), it matters little if his spectacular 87 yard touchdown catch/run occurred in the 1st quarter or was transposed to the 4th quarter in the movie for dramatic impact. In either case, the value of his performance  in the 1959 Cotton Bowl was incalculable as it related to the uplift of a marginalized, suppressed black populous in Dallas, Texas specifically and the nation, in general.  Unfortunately, unlike a near to contemporaneous role model from another sport, Roy Campenella, whose career was also derailed by a debilitating disease, Davis never had the opportunity to demonstrate his athletic brilliance in the brighter lights of professional sports  and stills remains an unknown quantity for far too many.

Flawed or not, this film is a genuine and timely attempt to address that obscurity.",1247788800,8,2297,5.239782016348774

I bought this movie as my Papa's Fathers Day gift (Football theme- a sure bet!) but the whole family enjoyed the movie (which we've seen twice already - it's that good!) Acting is superb - the young actor who plays Ernie actually looks like the real Ernie - the football sequences are excellent, & the terrible prejudices all too real. Dennis Quaid plays the Syracuse coach extremely well...all about football, but gradually realizing (through Ernie) that so much more is at stake.

Outstanding movie of overcoming...overcoming hate, prejudice, and even indifference..through being the best God made Ernie Davis to be..a football player who leads his team to victory & wins the Heisman Trophy - making history.  Sad to see the ending (will not give away..) but even in that, a good point for family discussion (life can't be all about just one thing - football..)

3042269,2,6303439136,"1, 2, hike goes the truth and here comes the sack! That is what Gary Fleder should have received for this dismal attempt at a docudrama. Gary Fleder's The Express, tells the story of an exceptionally talented young football player named Ernie Davis but fumbles the truth. He was born on December 14, 1939 and sadly died of Leukaemia at the age of 23, consequently denying him the chance to play Professional Football. Ernie Davis was the first African-American to win the coveted Heisman Trophy, for best college football player in 1961. Throughout his life he was surrounded by racism, the Davis family were also involved in the civil rights movement. These encounters toughened him up and shaped him into the ideal role model and ridiculously talented player he was.
  Even though the film is supposed to be about Ernie Davis (played by Rob Brown) a lot of the time he is cast to the bench as Ben Schwartzwalder (played by Dennis Quaid) the head coach of the Syracuse Football team takes over and calls the shots. Beyond doubt, Ernie Davis was a phenomenal young man, especially given what he accomplished (winning the Heisman Trophy as the first African-American) during the civil right's movement and in a relatively small amount of time.
  Despite being called The Express (Ernie's nickname was the Elmira Express) there is nothing express about this movie. It drags. What's more, the movie abuses its dramatic license and changes history. For example in the movie there is a scene where the Syracuse Orangemen play the crucial game of the season in hostile West Virginia in 1959. The home fans throw bottles from the stands and jeer at the away team in particular Ernie Davis and his other African American teammates. This is one of the most confrontational scenes, but this was actually a home game not away at West Virginia. The least Gary Fleder could have done was made the movie a bit more truth-based by changing this, since he decides not to emphasize the story of Ernie Davis.
  At the end of the day The Express gets derailed and fails to make it to the station at all. Viewers should be conscientious that it doesn't show how incredible a person Ernie Davis was. The Express should have focused more on Ernie by filming more of his life and how he accomplished so much. Instead of, benching him and letting Coach Ben Schwartzwalder seem like the chief reason Davis was so talented. By putting Ernie in the background this movie does not show his true character and confuses the audience since it is supposed to be about Ernie Davis. The movie becomes more of a clich&eacute; coach-centered movie instead of one that tells the remarkable story of a young man who accomplished so much in so little time. Director Gary Fleder could have added more substance to the movie by adding in more of Ernie's truth-based life story instead of the customary melodrama and unnecessary filler scenes. The movie could have also tried to do something out of the ordinary; instead they dramatize and shorten the achievements of Ernie Davis to put him in the background of the clouds of smoke coming out of the express train.",1243987200,3,3122,4.772222222222222
3042270,2,6303439136,"It is sadly ironic for a stale, 129 minute production to be called The Express. Like most Hollywood sports biopics, the extraordinary life of Ernie Davis has been reduced to a bunch of clich plot points, and thus extremely predictable; you could go into the movie knowing nothing about football and guess what's going to happen two hours later. Yet, the problem is not that Ernie Davis led a boring or miserable life, it's that the cinematic retelling of it makes it seem like it was. To put it bluntly, it's a director's failure.

The film kicks off depicting Ernie Davis as a child in the 40's, played by Justin Martin, who discovers his talent in running when he outruns a group of typical racist schoolyard bullies. From there, racism becomes the only recurring theme of the movie.

Fast forwarding many years later, the next scene depicts Davis, now played by Rob Brown, in his teenage years as he rises to the status of football sensation at his local high school in Elmira, N.Y. Sought after by many colleges due to his status,  Davis is eventually recruited by tough-but-reasonable coach Ben Schwartwelder (played by Dennis Quaid) into Syracuse College, who uses Davis's childhood inspiration Jim Brown (Darrin Dewitt Henson) to bait him in. From then on, despite facing racism everywhere, Davis helps the Syracuse Orangemen win the cotton bowl and ultimately become the #1 ranked team in the 1959 season.

Directed by Gary Fleder and adapted by Charles Leavitt, the film is packed to the brim with sport drama clichs. Too-tough-but-kind-inside coach, check.  Fierce, racist, opposing teams who are violent, full of themselves and lack a sense of morality, check. In fact, the film goes so far to fulfill these clichs that the directors have even fabricated material- Leavitt admits that the supposed 1958 game at Tar Heels Stadium in North Carolina, in which angry racist crowds chucked glass bottles and verbal abuse at the team, was inaccurate on all accounts.

Moreover, the supposed racial tension verses the Longhorns in the 1960 cotton bowl match was also pure fabrication. Bobby Lackey, quarterback for the University of Texas in the game depicted recalls: ""How are you going to say the N-word in a football game and spit on somebody? Coach Royal would not have put up with that kind of behavior. It was a long time ago, but I know we shook hands and told him nice game and that his team deserved to win."" Clearly, without any angry racist teams that actually played against the Orangemen, Gary Fleder had to resort to fabrication to get his point across, which certainly hurts the historical accuracy of the film.

It is worth noting that director Gary Fleder should be credited for the excellent chase sequences professionally shot with the hand camera- the shaky angles give the film one of its few realistic tinges. The only downside to that is that the angles aren't exactly groundbreaking or original- they only serve to remind the audience of better sport epics such as ""Remember the Titans"" or ""Glory Road.""

Rob Brown's performance as the near-saintly Ernie Davis is forgettable at best, but it's understandable as the weak storyline and script undermine his performance. The problem is, the movie won't let him be a real person, and thus nobody can relate to him. As one other critic put it, ""It's the complaint many people have had about Superman over the years. If he never does anything wrong, and if nothing can stop him, then what's interesting about him?""

In stark contrast, Quaid's performance as Coach Ben Schwartzwalder is quite the opposite: although Quaid still suffers from a lame script and overdone clichs, he still manages to shine as his character's underlying prejudices are brought forth and challenged by his relationship with Davis. In a memorable scene where he butts head with Davis, he manages to deliver this epic line:  ""I must like winning a little more than I dislike black people.""

For a movie that has ""Remember the Titans"" written all over, you would definitely expect more from The Express. Luckily, the solid performance given by Quaid and the intense action sequences are the film's saving grace. But for those who already have ESPN Classic or ""Remember the Titans"" on DVD, don't even bother.",1243468800,2,4253,4.9094707520891365
3042271,2,6303439136,"The Express is an ""inspirational"" biopic tale of Ernie Davis's life, depicting a warped reality of racial tension in the 1950's. Ernie Davis (Ron Brown), was born and raised in Pennsylvania before moving to New York, where he was recruited to play football for Syracuse University. The film follows Davis's trials and tribulations as he struggles with fitting into the predominantly white football team, and inadvertently becoming a voice in the Civil Rights Movement. He learns to deal with his closed-minded coach, Ben Shwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid), and eventually becomes the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy, an award given to the best college football player of the year.
 Ron Brown gives a winning performance portraying a calm and realistic Davis, albeit in a lacklustre tone. Dennis Quaid, however, provides the zest in the film, portraying Shwartzwalder as a coach transitioning from the old school of white supremacist thinking to the new school of racially equal thinking, much like the rest of America in this period of racial tensions. At times, though, the energy in Shwartzwalder's character tends to overshadow the real hero of the film, Davis, who occasionally gets sidelined as the film chooses to focus on the internal struggles playing out within Shwartzwalder. As the story shifts its focus from Davis to Shwartzwalder, the ""inspirational"" meaning behind the film is lost on the viewer, as the real hero and his grapplings concerning racism are forgotten for the mindlessly trivial problems of the coach.
 The cinematography somewhat redeems the film, however, with breathtaking scenes of a crisp, vividly coloured autumn in New York, and the rustic architectural charm of the campus in Syracuse University. The football games sprinkled generously throughout the movie were also very exciting, and football fan or not, you will be drawn to the sheer power and energy that the games possess.
  The film includes a scene where Syracuse goes to play a visiting match against West Virginia. When they arrive at the stadium, the racist fans of West Virginia attack the team for having black players. The scene is very intense, as it explores racial bigotry, but is also entirely untrue, for Syracuse had never played a game against West Virginia that year. This is a major historical inaccuracy, and creative license has been taken past the limit as the writers of the film manage to fabricate an entire football game with an aggressive audience.
 There are also a variety of other creative liberties taken throughout the film in order to enhance the dramatic racial tension in the football games. In another football game shown when Syracuse goes to play the Cotton Bowl Championships against the University of Texas, in which after Syracuse wins the game, a Texas player spit on Davis and called him the n-word. Players from the University of Texas dispute that scene, claiming that they just shook hands and peacefully walked off the field.
 The Express is a movie that entirely distorts history, and also shifts the focus of the story from the real hero, Davis, to his coach, Schwartzwalder. Creative license is taken much too far, and detracts from what would have been an inspiring biopic. The acting and cinematography are brilliant, but unfortunately is not enough to warrant a viewing of the film. If you're an avid football fan, you can go for the thrilling games, but otherwise it's recommended to keep your distance.",1242777600,4,3459,5.102473498233215
3042272,4,6303439136,"The Express is the story of Ernie Davis, a running back for Syracuse University that won the 1960 Cotton Bowl MVP on the way to helping his team with the National Championship, and then followed that up with the 1961 Heisman Trophy. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns who wanted to team him with the legendary Jim Brown, also from Syracuse University, in the same backfield.

As others have noted, the filmmakers did take some license with the story of Ernie Davis. Although having seen a documentary about Davis, the departures from the truth aren't really very big. For example, the filmmakers portray Davis as having been drafted by the Cleveland Browns. In fact this is not true. He was drafted by the Washington Redskins, but because the Redskins at that time were owned by noted racist George Preston Marshall, Davis was immediately traded to the Cleveland Browns, owned by Art Modell.

The action scenes are among the best football scenes I've ever seen in a movie. I could almost feel the hits Rob Brown, portraying Davis, took during some of the games portrayed in the film. It was also saddening to me to see the on field racism that Davis had to endure at Syrcause. Jackie Robinson was subjected to taunts and sometimes an occasional dirty play at second base, but as a football player it seems Davis was routinely subjected to dirty hits after the whistle. What Davis went through perhaps was even worse in some ways than what Jackie Robinson endured.

I also think that the movie does a good job of portraying Davis as someone who initially only wanted to be a running back and didn't much think about national politics, turning into a responsible thoughtful adult who wanted the chance to do anything his skills could enable him to do, and not be limited by the ""unwritten rules"" of the time.

The only gripe I really have with the film is that in my opinion it is too short. After Syracuse wins the National Championship the next season is not portrayed. That said, the last few scenes are very poignant and well done.

Davis might have been even better that Jim Brown. Davis led his team to a national championship and became the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy.

This is a another feel-good racism sports movie along the lines of Meet the Titans or Glory Road. I say ""feel-good"" because the harsh realities of American racism in the late 1950s are explored and covered, but racism's true graphic and intense nature is never displayed.

Ernie Davis was always an optimistic man. He was one of a few minorities on campus and on the team, yet he was always kind to everyone. This movie made even better because most people haven't heard of Davis. He died tragically at the age of 23 from lukemia. He is truly a man that deserves to be honored in a movie like this.

The football scenes are top notch. Dennis Quaid is great as the Orangemen coach. The period settings really capture the feel of the time this movie was based in.

Let me get the technical details covered first for those that worry more about that stuff than about the quality of the story in a movie.  The Express, at least on Blu-ray disc, features absolutely stunningly impressive video quality.  Even the most picky of viewers would likely call the picture quality here 'reference' level.  It really is that good and rises to almost match the quality of the story that is in the film.  The same can be said of the audio quality which is equally impressive.

Note that I said that the picture and audio quality almost rises to the quality of the story, and yet I also called them reference quality.  If you've picked up on that description then hopefully you'll have figured out my opinion of the story and can probably guess that I can't recommend this film highly enough.

Sadly, the film didn't do that well while it was out in theatrical release, earning back less than 1/4 of what was reportedly spent on it.  I think that all says more about how people perceive sports oriented movies than anything else, as it seems people instead want thrillers, slashers and films in other genres to spend their entertainment money on.

I don't want to spoil the film for anyone that hasn't seen it, but will say it's based on actual events and a real person.  If you haven't heard of Ernie Davis, don't feel bad as many people probably have no idea of his significance in history.

3276572,2,6303439136,"hello,
  having grown up in the same time period, but on the west coast, there wasn't much of the prejudice as in the south and east. football will always be a national sport and stars will always be on the fore front.  understanding human kindness and acceptance was the first step in being accepted in all of society.  there are still barriers for a lot of people and that is awful, being that we are in 2017.  but for the majority of the people those barriers have changed for the better.  this movie was pretty accurate and was extremely fun to watch the real life scenes for those in the east and south.  the east and south temperament?  not our cup of tea, that is for sure.

a great movie and storyline",1502496000,,709,4.3106060606060606

3276589,5,6303439136,"My previous greatest football movies are two <ANY GIVEN SUNDAY><REMEMBER THE TITANS>. Well that just have been changed the moment I saw this movie.
You better grab this bluray cause it's just stupidly 5.11$ and that price is just redunculous. The visual/ audio quality is top notch and you won't ever go back to dvd again if you watch this one. And most of all this is the best sports movie ever in my life. NA, let me rephrase, one of the best.
Of course there is <ROCKY> unbeatable film and all.

The story is about this Afro -African guy who dies at the age of so young 23 who shines so bright for such a short time as a foogball player.
Behind him was another great coach Nennis Quaid a white guy a tough bastard but is ok dude whom everyone will fall in love if got to know him well.

Most of all the camera usage is just stunning and you will die for it. It almost remnded me of the car race movie <RUSH> the best movie that has the best camera work ever. Yes this movie was that good.

And then There is Dennis Quaid the great actor that will blow your mind. He is a passionate coach who wants to make this new comer Rob Brown somwwhat invisible but looking back is humorous but charming to look at. Not to flamboyant but stand out enough to want to see again and again kind of actor.
And also is the great beauty Nicole Beharie a chocolate coated SADE kind of girl whom you cannot deny but to fall in love.
But most of all the game sequences are pure stunning to look at.
True heartbeat that you will feel like sitting at the edge of the seat.
The there is this moment when the great player finds out that he is having this desease that he cannot beat.
He's been throught so many things for his position for chist sake.
The prejusice from White people the money the support, the everything beyond.

Now that he is playing well, he is facing death.

But then again he's got nothing to loose.
There comes aglong another new comer saying you are my dream my hero.
He says don't be another me. You be another you. Be a great guy not pretend to be another me. Don't chase my shadow because it's gonna be another shadow that you cannot keep. Something like that.

He was a great guy a great player that you should remember and this movie made him as such.",1472601600,,2257,4.200923787528868

The film on Davis's life does not show or present an understanding of Ernie. Though not intended to depict Royal, the movie is distorted there as well as much of the events in the movie. Yes, we take historical events and re-write them to make some point and in so doing, we fictionalize history as well as unfairly cast some cloak of untruth and error on a person's or culture's life. The base is there was and is, sadly again, prejudice and bias in our culture, Texas and elsewhere. That is a negative and to picture it, for me, and I emphasize for me, as fiction to make a point lowers the reader, viewer, participant to a non thinking robot, or better, puppet, to be manipulated without thinking or using reason as a base to understand what is reality. To make a statement of racism's existence by distorting and fictionalizing events, and events that reflect a person's character in an erroneous and clearly in error manner is a .....is a not!!!! There are five primary ways by which we know: the way of authority, empiricism, rationalism, mysticism and revelation.

3276730,2,6303439136,"Oh boy! Another sports movie (sarcastic tone implied). The Express (2008) is an important story wrapped in an atrociously obvious ball of sports movie clichs, unrealistic portrayal of history, and characters more one sided than Fox News.
We start out in what looks to be heaven, but is supposed to look like a Philadelphia suburb in the 1940's. For some strange reason, the colors are brighter, grass is greener and cars, houses and people are shinier and more attractive, and from what I gather, everyone is rich and World War 2 never happened. Our lead, Ernie Davis, is a 'poor' kid who gets discovered playing football in high school and ends up playing for Syracuse University and becoming the first African American to win the Heisman, and encountering the race issues in a 1950's civil rights era America. Although the shiny, made-for-TV feel of the entire thing is unrealistic and inaccurate, it is a commonality in feel good conventional flicks like this, so this is not where I lay my grievances.
 I think what bothered me most with the movie was the almost constant state of ignorance our lead character, Ernie Davis, was in. For an African American who grew up in the Jim Crow 40's and 50's, he is pretty appalled at the racism he encounters. He walks by a store owner, says ""how do you do, fine day isn't it?"" or something along those lines, and is utterly shocked that the white man put his head down and walks in without a response. Had he been in the south, he should have been utterly appalled that he wasn't lynched. Even in the north, where this event took place, prancing around town with that smirk of innocence is not normal behavior for an African American of that time, and I'm certain that the real Ernie Davis was would be well aware of that fact. Similarly, another example would be the ""white girl speech"" in which the head coach subtly fills Davis in on what shouldn't come as such a surprise. The fact of the matter is that multi-racial dating did not become socially acceptable until the late 70's, or some could argue it still isn't. So for a black man in the 50's to find this unacceptable is historically inaccurate. This is an issue throughout the film, and perhaps one that gets even more prevalent, when Davis and his African American friends are subject to segregation in Texas, and once again, surprised. However this was not the end of what I disliked about the film.
 The pan zoom shot of the trophy case and the athlete as the soft, slow trumpet overcomes the shot, the star player magically returning to the game despite a serious injury, the locker room fights, and the last minute scoring for the win. Sound familiar? Although this is a given in sports movies, especially the classics, the clear lack of original writing is noteworthy.
In addition, it seems that ever character in the film is far too simple. What I mean to say is, the director creates this polarization throughout the movie between good and evil. Everyone either has a heat of gold or the antichrist. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground between the issues. The Deep South is depicted as a dark, terrifying place where everyone white person is racist, and every black person is an innocent victim. Although generalizations such as this may be both relevant a for the most part accurate, it is the only side of the story we see in the film. This presents what one could almost call a simplified dumbed down version of the civil rights movement.
One thing I can say about ""The Express"" is that it looks quite nice, with two or three really beautifully done shots. Add that to a fine performance by Dennis Quaid as head coach, and the movie has some legs; short, stubby legs. As far as portraying the actual events, I couldn't find any mistakes, so it is only lacking in truth in the conventional sense, in capturing the essence 'feel' of a time.
The fact is that this movie isn't made to be realistic, nor is it made to thoroughly educate the general public about the civil rights movement. It is made to entertain, and that is something that this high-budget piece of consumerism can handle, for the most part. If you are looking for a classic tale of 'feel-good,' good vs. evil movie that dumbs down and over polishes history, this is a movie for you; if you want the substance, form, realism and intellectual controversy of the actual civil rights movement, you must not be familiar with how Hollywood works.",1354752000,,4425,4.635668789808917
3276731,4,6303439136,"it is unfortunate that parts of this movie, for example, the Syracuse-West Virginia game, which took place in Syracuse, are not historically accurate, because this is a great movie, juxtaposing Ernie's youth and football career with the emerging civil rights movement and the struggle for racial equality. Rob Brown as Davis captures the courage and dignity of Ernie, whether battling racism or fighting leukemia. Several of Ernie's teammates from Syracuse were interviewd about the movie and although they praised Dennis Quaid's performance as their ex-coach they were dismayed at the scene depicting the W.V.-S.U. game, in which Coach pulled Davis, leading to words between them. NEVER HAPPENED and did not portray the player-coach relationship accurately. The special features with interviews with Jim Brown, and teammat John Brown and other teammates are a nice bonus. Great jobs by Charles Dutton, as Ernie's grandfather and Quaid. Football scenes were well done. I am surprised this movie did not do better at the box office.

3276734,5,6303439136,This movie is my favorite because I grew up with 2 of my brothers who played football and I started to follow football on television with my dad and my brothers but when I had the idea of playing football they said no it was too dangerous for me to play!,1351555200,,254,4.0
3276735,5,6303439136,"Most sports movies based on real life situations and events are a mixed bag, with more good than bad, see ""We Are Marshall"" for a great example. ""Remember The Titans"" was one of the better ones to tackle the issues of racism and bigotry in the '50's and '60's, where even with the PG rating you could get at least a sampling of the tension and drama that a lot of people went through in that time. ""The Express"" deals with a young man by the name of Ernie Davis (played by Rob Brown ""Finding Forrester""  who has grown up facing all kinds of racism, bigotry, hate and whatnot throughout his childhood into his teens and to his days at Syracuse College where a running back by the name of Jim Brown (any big time football fan will know this name) has just signed with the pro team Cleveland Browns but didn't win the famed college trophy The Heisman.

Ernie has always been fast even as a kid, which is shown in a fantastic opening sequence with a young Ernie outrunning a bunch of white kids, there's scenes with Davis overcoming his stuttering issue thanks to his grandpa encouraging and supporting him. Once he gets to Syracuse the coach (Dennis Quaid, ""The Rookie"") sees him as the next Jim Brown but that doesn't mean he doesn't push his players as Davis harder than ever and expect nothing less than the very best.

As far as an accurate story I admit I'm not too familiar with Ernie Davis' story, but as far as the era I feel the filmmakers captured the feel and look of it very well. The hate and scorn black people received during this time probably can't ever be fully captured on film but for a PG rated sports flick ""The Express"" does a more than admiral job telling a great story. The football footage mixes archive clips with movie footage which does make for a great experience though the football aspect is only part of the flick as the real story is how Ernie had a never say die attitude.

One great part of the film is a brawl that breaks out during the 1960 Cotton Bowl vs. Texas where the racism just boils over on the field just before halftime. I'm sure there are some liberties taken with the true story, though those who know how it ended know it didn't turn out well, but that doesn't prevent this movie from being one great sports flick that keeps your attention throughout its running time. **** out of 4 stars.",1347235200,,2337,4.390300230946882

3276737,3,6303439136,"""The Express: The Ernie Davis Story"" is an inspirational football movie LOOSELY based on the true story of Ernie Davis, the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy - following his 1961 season at Syracuse University. Davis is played by Rob Brown.

The movie, unfortunately, rather than focusing on Ernie Davis, splits the focus and ends up being not only about Davis but a lot about his football coach, Ben Schwartzwalder, played by Dennis Quaid. Both parts are played well but since this is ""The Ernie Davis Story,"" I would have preferred more about Davis.

I would have enjoyed finding out more about how Davis FELT about the times he was living in.  The movie takes place during the height of the civil rights movement.  Davis was also the first African-American - nationally - to become a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu Fraternity, a Jewish fraternity, while at Syracuse University.  He was also the first African-American to be the first overall draft pick, going to the Redskins in the 1962 NFL draft and then being traded to the Browns.

Davis was a fantastic running back, which the movie does show.  He also died tragically at 23 years old of leukemia, before playing his first pro game.

The movie was worth watching - as a sports movie, as long as you aren't overly concerned by details; and as an inspirational story.  It's a tearjerker so be prepared.

3276739,4,6303439136,"Gary Fleder's ""The Express"" just adds to the ever-increasing list of sports movies centred around a hero overcoming adversary. The producers successfully managed to combine the true story of athletic achievement and overcoming racism to create a melodramatic movie that we've all seen before.

Although ""The Express"" doesn't stand out and is entirely predictable, it definitely appeals to the masses. Ernie Davis played by Rob Brown, is shown as a promising football player while growing up who goes on to play for Syracuse University and eventually gets drafted by the Cleveland Browns. During his time at Syracuse, Davis leads his team to win the school's first national football championship and becomes the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy.

All of the actors portrayed their characters as likeable and charismatic although almost all of their roles can be found in every other dramatic sport film. Ernie's white teammates are rude and intolerant of Ernie and start a number of locker room fights while Dennis Quaid's character is the harsh coach with a good heart who sticks with Davis until the very end. Although the numerous shots of football games along with fast paced music keep the audience's attention, the storyline is extremely predictable and difficult to get invested in.

""The Express"" has excellent cinematography with plenty of scenes of the real football games that Ernie Davis was playing in along with re-enacted footage that will leave you gaping at the screen. However, cinematography can only go so far in telling the story and what the director, Gary Fleder, excelled at in the technicalities of filming, he fell short at with portraying Ernie Davis' story in a way that moved viewers. The concept of Davis becoming a star in an environment where he was constantly facing discrimination is undoubtedly a powerful one. This coupled with Davis' diagnosis of leukaemia alone has the potential of an extremely powerful film. However, viewers never got to see how Ernie evolved as a person and how he felt about not being able to join his team at hotels and restaurants because of the colour of his skin. Ernie's diagnosis was also not focused on until around the last 20 minutes of the movie and even then, the tone of the movie didn't match the direction that the story was heading in, one where Davis died at only 23 years old.

Scenes that focused on the racism prevalent in Davis' life were mostly inaccurate. It was definitely something that Davis and the Syracuse team had to deal with but the screaming southern Texans that were shown at the 1960 Cotton Bowl Classic were a product of dramatic licence. One of the first games shown was between Syracuse and West Virginia University during which West Virginia team members and referees both acted with obvious bias against the Orangemen. Film Journal International critic Frank Lovece commented on the scene by saying that it ""veers remarkably toward outright slander."" In reality, the Syracuse coach, Ben Schwartzwalder, was revered at WVU and the Syracuse quarterback Dick Easterly said that the scene was completely fictitious. The pivotal Cotton Bowl scene was also inaccurate with its representation of the racial tension in the stadium. Bobby Lackey who was quarterback of the University of Texas team said, ""...they were making up stories to try and sell more movie tickets.""

Not only were the football games inaccurate but it can also be argued that the entire movie did not accurately represent Ernie Davis' life at all. John Brown, Davis' friend, teammate, and roommate was asked whether or not the film was a genuine portrayal of Ernie and Brown said, ""...in short, no.""

""The Express"" is a well made Hollywood take on how Ernie Davis went on to become an inspiration to thousands and is perfect for those who won't mind watching yet another adaptation of every football movie in existence.",1332720000,9,3897,5.015455950540958

3276745,4,6303439136,"Bottom-Line: Overall ""The Express"" succeeds at both educating and inspiring and that is never a bad thing!

""The Express: The Ernie Davis Story (2008),"" opens with the following narration: ""Twenty-one lines, five yards apart-that's a football game. But there are other lines that run deeper, and wider, that aren't part of any game."" As a Black American male who grew up in the seventies, partly in the North, partly in the South of this nation, I know all too well the meaning of the subtext.

But my experiences as traumatic and life-altering as they were to me, were nothing, nothing compared to those of Black American men and women who scarified much in the decade leading up to the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. And their courage helped fill in the deep racial divide that so used to stain--and still stains--this nation in rutty ugliness.  They did it by achieving when and where they weren't supposed to, showing the nation and the world that Black Americans were--and are--every bit the equal of White's and, in some cases, better!  Such is the case with Ernie Davis and ""The Express"" is his tale.

Story-Line

Directed by (Gary Fleder ~ October Road), ""The Express"" opens on an all too familiar scene: two Black American boys (cousins) are confronted by a gaggle of White's demanding the spoils of their labor: collecting glass bottles for the deposits.  One boy hops a train to escape, the other (Ernie Davis ~ Justin Martin) eludes the boys with a combination of slick moves and lightning speed.

Flash forward: Ernie Davis (Rob Brown ~ Stop Loss, Treme), nicknamed the ""The Elmira Express,"" is an all-star running back for his Elmira, NY high school and is being recruited by Syracuse University coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid ~ The Parent Trap, Flight of the Phoenix, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra) and Jim Brown (Darrin Dewitt Henson ~ Soul Food, Stomp The Yard, Lincoln Heights) to play for the Syracuse Orangeman; he accepts.

Thus begins an odyssey that will eventually see Ernie Davis win the famed Heisman Trophy in 1961.

My Thoughts

""The Express: The Ernie Davis Story"" is an inspiration, how could it not be taking place as it did just as the American Civil Rights movement was kicking into high gear, and Ernie Davis was one of the faces of a young Black America hungry for change.  Racial equality, true justice and equivalency were the touchstones of the movement and Ernie Davis was one of the symbols Black Americans were proud to point to as a representation of the race as a whole.

Well-acted and directed, ""The Express: The Ernie Davis Story"" at times made me smile, made me angry, made me proud and made me shed a tear.  Like I said the movie is inspirational and moving.  Lead Rob Brown turned in an outstanding performance and showcases the all too under-utilized talent Black American actors bring to theatrical table.  Two thumbs up to the Denis Quaid as well for a masterful depiction of a typical college football coach.

Here are some thing you do not know about Ernie Davis; I know I did know them before watching this movie: he was a two-time first-team All-America running back at Syracuse University; he led his team to an undefeated season and a national championship, the first for Syracuse University; most importantly, he, Ernie Davis, was the first black man to earn college football's most coveted award, the oft-revered Heisman Trophy.

These are the fact young American children, black or white, red, or brown, do not learn about in school, not even at the college level unless you attend a Black College or University, or take an African American studies class.  If you are a Black American child you are taught that your ancestors used to be slaves and little else; good luck trying to find achievements by Black Americans in a Texas state history book!  It takes movies like ""The Express"", Rosewood (1997), Separate But Equal (1991), Roots (1977) and others to tell the unvarnished history of Black achievement in America.

Not that ""The Express"" did not take license with the truth; e.g. the team get together at the local rib joint after the Cotton Bowl purportedly never took place.  And the movie was over-dramatic at times.  But overall ""The Express"" succeeds at both educating and inspiring and that is never a bad thing!",1293580800,2,4309,4.808943089430894

3276752,4,6303439136,"Based on a true story, The Express follows the bittersweet yet extraordinary life of Ernie Davis (played by Rob Brown), the first African American to win the prestigious Heisman Trophy in the Civil rights era. His fight for equality and respect forever changed the face of American sports and his story continues to inspire new generations.

 This docudrama begins with Davis as a stuttering youth, growing up in a small coal town outside of Pittsburgh with his grandfather, affectionally known as Pops whom he is very close to.  Ernie later moves to Elmira with his mother, where he joins a small football league. With Ernie's extraordinary skills, he is eventually sought after by 50 colleges which was a huge feat for a black person during the civil rights era. An era when Black players were unwelcome in the South. Ernie is soon called by coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid) and football legend Jim Brown (Darrin Dewitt Henson) who make Ernie part of their team, the Syracuse Orangemen. Ernie Davis leads the team to an undefeated season. Despite all the racism he faces at nearly every point of his life, determined Ernie becomes the first African American to win the Heisman trophy and goes on to play for the Cleveland Browns.

 The Express isn't just about football; it shows black pride and determination despite the racism. An important scene in the movie that portrays this determination, is when the team travels to West Virginia University to play the mountaineers. The coach removes Ernie from the game because he fears that if he scored a touchdown, the audience would react violently. However, Ernie refuses to be removed from the game and scores a touch down. Afterwards the coach and Ernie have an angry confrontation where the coach states "" If I let you carry that goal all the way across the board, we might not get on the bus in one piece, thats how it works around here."" Ernie, angered by this statement tells the coach to respect him as an equal part of the team and not give in to racism.  As the growing civil rights movement divided the country in the 60's, Davis became a symbol for achievement that transcended race. Davis refused to flinch from others' prejudices and achieved all his goals.  He was referred to by John F. Kennedy as an "" Outstanding young man of great character who served as an inspiration to young people of this country.""

 Having received many positive remarks, critics have also pointed out some flaws. In a USA Today article by Mike Clark, The Express is said to have ""mostly conventional storytelling."" The movie fails to recognize the rest of Davis' life. It doesn't bring up the fact that after being drafted by pro football in 1961, Davis developed leukemia and died in 1963 never having played a pro game. This shows that The Express attempted to only present the happy sides of Davis' life and disregard the rest.
 Also, according to journalists and film critics there are some historical inaccuracies.  The locations shown in the movie are fictitious. The Express changed the location of where the games actually took place. Frank Lovece, a Film Journal International critic stated ""That game is falsely shown as taking place at WVU's Mountaineer Field"" in Morgantown, West Virginia, rather than at Syracuse's own Archbold Stadium."" As a result, the film has drawn the ire of many West Virginians, including the state's governor, Joe Manchin, and university officials.  A similar mistake was also made at the scene in the finished film, whose original script didn't involve West Virginia. This scene was supposed to depict a 1958 game at the Tar Heels Stadium in North Carolina. This is completely inaccurate. In the season of 1958 Davis was still a freshman and therefore didn't play on the Orangemen's varsity team. Syracuse didn't even play North Carolina until 1995.  As far as the sequence of plays and scores go, The Express shows them completely out of order. But these are just minor inaccuracies which don't effect the movie or its reputation much.
 Referencing the inaccuracy of the location of the game, Frank Lovece, a Journal International critic stated that, ""The Express plays fast and loose with the historical record, and while dramatization is a given in biopics, these scenes here veer remarkably toward outright slander.""
 All together, The Express is an extremely inspirational movie. This docudrama can strengthen anyones determination to achieve their goals. It can also teach people to stand up for their beliefs despite what others think.  Despite the historical inaccuracies, The Express is a solid touchdown.",1275782400,6,4602,4.957142857142857

Yes, I knew he was the first African-American to win the Heisman--and he won it when the civil rights issue was at its zenith.  And yes, I knew he died tragically young, but had no idea leukemia claimed him at age 23, before he even got to play a down in the NFL.  And I did not know the Cleveland Browns, who drafted him to play alongside fellow Syracuse legend Jim Brown, retired his jersey number.  But I know all of this now, thanks to watching THE EXPRESS, a tribute to Ernie Davis and his collegiate career.  Sure, it's a little sappy and reeks of melodramatic cliches at times, but overall this is a very moving story about a young man of strong moral fiber fighting not only tacklers on the field, but a society determined to keep him at second class status.

THE EXPRESS features a superb cast, including Rob Brown in the lead role.  Brown plays the young Syracuse superstar with calm demeanor and resolute determination; other actors, given the racial tensions of the setting, might have been tempted to go over the top, but Brown keeps the lid on.  I thoroughly enjoyed Dennis Quaid as gruff head coach Ben Schwartzwalder--a man who must go on a personal journey of his own, as he discovers he's not as open and tolerant as he originally believes.  And I really liked Darrin Dewitt Henson playing the proud, yet always defiant, Jim Brown.  The football scenes--particularly the 1960 Cotton Bowl against an angry Texas team--are gritty and realistic; sports fans will enjoy the action, while everyone else will enjoy the humanity THE EXPRESS so aptly depicts.

Yet, not one of the aforementioned presumptive deficiencies serve to mitigate my personal contention it remains a worthwhile movie for any real fan of college sports  and manages to effectively convey the spirit of socio-cultural dictates of the represented era .  It is an absolutely enjoyable drama based on the life Ernie Davis, not a documentary of the life of Ernie Davis.

Davis was not a trailblazer nor was he alone in absorbing the ignorant, racist invectives and missiles launched in the direction of blacks from nearly every nook and cranny of an America gradually but at glacial-like pace being moved in the direction of a more pluralistic society. From most accounts and most assuredly based on the depiction in this movie, he was an impressive individual and athlete who by virtue of his athleticism ascended to the status of role model and hero for legions of people but tragically was afflicted with leukemia and died at the much too tender age of 23.

Portrayed with subtle intensity by Rob Brown and continually juxtaposed with his college coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid, in a role where significantly more complexity was exhibited than he is typically given credit), it matters little if his spectacular 87 yard touchdown catch/run occurred in the 1st quarter or was transposed to the 4th quarter in the movie for dramatic impact. In either case, the value of his performance  in the 1959 Cotton Bowl was incalculable as it related to the uplift of a marginalized, suppressed black populous in Dallas, Texas specifically and the nation, in general.  Unfortunately, unlike a near to contemporaneous role model from another sport, Roy Campenella, whose career was also derailed by a debilitating disease, Davis never had the opportunity to demonstrate his athletic brilliance in the brighter lights of professional sports  and stills remains an unknown quantity for far too many.

3276766,2,6303439136,"1, 2, hike goes the truth and here comes the sack! That is what Gary Fleder should have received for this dismal attempt at a docudrama. Gary Fleder's The Express, tells the story of an exceptionally talented young football player named Ernie Davis but fumbles the truth. He was born on December 14, 1939 and sadly died of Leukaemia at the age of 23, consequently denying him the chance to play Professional Football. Ernie Davis was the first African-American to win the coveted Heisman Trophy, for best college football player in 1961. Throughout his life he was surrounded by racism, the Davis family were also involved in the civil rights movement. These encounters toughened him up and shaped him into the ideal role model and ridiculously talented player he was.
  Even though the film is supposed to be about Ernie Davis (played by Rob Brown) a lot of the time he is cast to the bench as Ben Schwartzwalder (played by Dennis Quaid) the head coach of the Syracuse Football team takes over and calls the shots. Beyond doubt, Ernie Davis was a phenomenal young man, especially given what he accomplished (winning the Heisman Trophy as the first African-American) during the civil right's movement and in a relatively small amount of time.
  Despite being called The Express (Ernie's nickname was the Elmira Express) there is nothing express about this movie. It drags. What's more, the movie abuses its dramatic license and changes history. For example in the movie there is a scene where the Syracuse Orangemen play the crucial game of the season in hostile West Virginia in 1959. The home fans throw bottles from the stands and jeer at the away team in particular Ernie Davis and his other African American teammates. This is one of the most confrontational scenes, but this was actually a home game not away at West Virginia. The least Gary Fleder could have done was made the movie a bit more truth-based by changing this, since he decides not to emphasize the story of Ernie Davis.
  At the end of the day The Express gets derailed and fails to make it to the station at all. Viewers should be conscientious that it doesn't show how incredible a person Ernie Davis was. The Express should have focused more on Ernie by filming more of his life and how he accomplished so much. Instead of, benching him and letting Coach Ben Schwartzwalder seem like the chief reason Davis was so talented. By putting Ernie in the background this movie does not show his true character and confuses the audience since it is supposed to be about Ernie Davis. The movie becomes more of a clich&eacute; coach-centered movie instead of one that tells the remarkable story of a young man who accomplished so much in so little time. Director Gary Fleder could have added more substance to the movie by adding in more of Ernie's truth-based life story instead of the customary melodrama and unnecessary filler scenes. The movie could have also tried to do something out of the ordinary; instead they dramatize and shorten the achievements of Ernie Davis to put him in the background of the clouds of smoke coming out of the express train.",1243987200,3,3122,4.772222222222222
3276767,2,6303439136,"It is sadly ironic for a stale, 129 minute production to be called The Express. Like most Hollywood sports biopics, the extraordinary life of Ernie Davis has been reduced to a bunch of clich plot points, and thus extremely predictable; you could go into the movie knowing nothing about football and guess what's going to happen two hours later. Yet, the problem is not that Ernie Davis led a boring or miserable life, it's that the cinematic retelling of it makes it seem like it was. To put it bluntly, it's a director's failure.

The film kicks off depicting Ernie Davis as a child in the 40's, played by Justin Martin, who discovers his talent in running when he outruns a group of typical racist schoolyard bullies. From there, racism becomes the only recurring theme of the movie.

Fast forwarding many years later, the next scene depicts Davis, now played by Rob Brown, in his teenage years as he rises to the status of football sensation at his local high school in Elmira, N.Y. Sought after by many colleges due to his status,  Davis is eventually recruited by tough-but-reasonable coach Ben Schwartwelder (played by Dennis Quaid) into Syracuse College, who uses Davis's childhood inspiration Jim Brown (Darrin Dewitt Henson) to bait him in. From then on, despite facing racism everywhere, Davis helps the Syracuse Orangemen win the cotton bowl and ultimately become the #1 ranked team in the 1959 season.

Directed by Gary Fleder and adapted by Charles Leavitt, the film is packed to the brim with sport drama clichs. Too-tough-but-kind-inside coach, check.  Fierce, racist, opposing teams who are violent, full of themselves and lack a sense of morality, check. In fact, the film goes so far to fulfill these clichs that the directors have even fabricated material- Leavitt admits that the supposed 1958 game at Tar Heels Stadium in North Carolina, in which angry racist crowds chucked glass bottles and verbal abuse at the team, was inaccurate on all accounts.

Moreover, the supposed racial tension verses the Longhorns in the 1960 cotton bowl match was also pure fabrication. Bobby Lackey, quarterback for the University of Texas in the game depicted recalls: ""How are you going to say the N-word in a football game and spit on somebody? Coach Royal would not have put up with that kind of behavior. It was a long time ago, but I know we shook hands and told him nice game and that his team deserved to win."" Clearly, without any angry racist teams that actually played against the Orangemen, Gary Fleder had to resort to fabrication to get his point across, which certainly hurts the historical accuracy of the film.

It is worth noting that director Gary Fleder should be credited for the excellent chase sequences professionally shot with the hand camera- the shaky angles give the film one of its few realistic tinges. The only downside to that is that the angles aren't exactly groundbreaking or original- they only serve to remind the audience of better sport epics such as ""Remember the Titans"" or ""Glory Road.""

Rob Brown's performance as the near-saintly Ernie Davis is forgettable at best, but it's understandable as the weak storyline and script undermine his performance. The problem is, the movie won't let him be a real person, and thus nobody can relate to him. As one other critic put it, ""It's the complaint many people have had about Superman over the years. If he never does anything wrong, and if nothing can stop him, then what's interesting about him?""

In stark contrast, Quaid's performance as Coach Ben Schwartzwalder is quite the opposite: although Quaid still suffers from a lame script and overdone clichs, he still manages to shine as his character's underlying prejudices are brought forth and challenged by his relationship with Davis. In a memorable scene where he butts head with Davis, he manages to deliver this epic line:  ""I must like winning a little more than I dislike black people.""

For a movie that has ""Remember the Titans"" written all over, you would definitely expect more from The Express. Luckily, the solid performance given by Quaid and the intense action sequences are the film's saving grace. But for those who already have ESPN Classic or ""Remember the Titans"" on DVD, don't even bother.",1243468800,2,4253,4.9094707520891365
3276768,2,6303439136,"The Express is an ""inspirational"" biopic tale of Ernie Davis's life, depicting a warped reality of racial tension in the 1950's. Ernie Davis (Ron Brown), was born and raised in Pennsylvania before moving to New York, where he was recruited to play football for Syracuse University. The film follows Davis's trials and tribulations as he struggles with fitting into the predominantly white football team, and inadvertently becoming a voice in the Civil Rights Movement. He learns to deal with his closed-minded coach, Ben Shwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid), and eventually becomes the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy, an award given to the best college football player of the year.
 Ron Brown gives a winning performance portraying a calm and realistic Davis, albeit in a lacklustre tone. Dennis Quaid, however, provides the zest in the film, portraying Shwartzwalder as a coach transitioning from the old school of white supremacist thinking to the new school of racially equal thinking, much like the rest of America in this period of racial tensions. At times, though, the energy in Shwartzwalder's character tends to overshadow the real hero of the film, Davis, who occasionally gets sidelined as the film chooses to focus on the internal struggles playing out within Shwartzwalder. As the story shifts its focus from Davis to Shwartzwalder, the ""inspirational"" meaning behind the film is lost on the viewer, as the real hero and his grapplings concerning racism are forgotten for the mindlessly trivial problems of the coach.
 The cinematography somewhat redeems the film, however, with breathtaking scenes of a crisp, vividly coloured autumn in New York, and the rustic architectural charm of the campus in Syracuse University. The football games sprinkled generously throughout the movie were also very exciting, and football fan or not, you will be drawn to the sheer power and energy that the games possess.
  The film includes a scene where Syracuse goes to play a visiting match against West Virginia. When they arrive at the stadium, the racist fans of West Virginia attack the team for having black players. The scene is very intense, as it explores racial bigotry, but is also entirely untrue, for Syracuse had never played a game against West Virginia that year. This is a major historical inaccuracy, and creative license has been taken past the limit as the writers of the film manage to fabricate an entire football game with an aggressive audience.
 There are also a variety of other creative liberties taken throughout the film in order to enhance the dramatic racial tension in the football games. In another football game shown when Syracuse goes to play the Cotton Bowl Championships against the University of Texas, in which after Syracuse wins the game, a Texas player spit on Davis and called him the n-word. Players from the University of Texas dispute that scene, claiming that they just shook hands and peacefully walked off the field.
 The Express is a movie that entirely distorts history, and also shifts the focus of the story from the real hero, Davis, to his coach, Schwartzwalder. Creative license is taken much too far, and detracts from what would have been an inspiring biopic. The acting and cinematography are brilliant, but unfortunately is not enough to warrant a viewing of the film. If you're an avid football fan, you can go for the thrilling games, but otherwise it's recommended to keep your distance.",1242777600,4,3459,5.102473498233215
3276769,4,6303439136,"The Express is the story of Ernie Davis, a running back for Syracuse University that won the 1960 Cotton Bowl MVP on the way to helping his team with the National Championship, and then followed that up with the 1961 Heisman Trophy. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns who wanted to team him with the legendary Jim Brown, also from Syracuse University, in the same backfield.

As others have noted, the filmmakers did take some license with the story of Ernie Davis. Although having seen a documentary about Davis, the departures from the truth aren't really very big. For example, the filmmakers portray Davis as having been drafted by the Cleveland Browns. In fact this is not true. He was drafted by the Washington Redskins, but because the Redskins at that time were owned by noted racist George Preston Marshall, Davis was immediately traded to the Cleveland Browns, owned by Art Modell.

The action scenes are among the best football scenes I've ever seen in a movie. I could almost feel the hits Rob Brown, portraying Davis, took during some of the games portrayed in the film. It was also saddening to me to see the on field racism that Davis had to endure at Syrcause. Jackie Robinson was subjected to taunts and sometimes an occasional dirty play at second base, but as a football player it seems Davis was routinely subjected to dirty hits after the whistle. What Davis went through perhaps was even worse in some ways than what Jackie Robinson endured.

I also think that the movie does a good job of portraying Davis as someone who initially only wanted to be a running back and didn't much think about national politics, turning into a responsible thoughtful adult who wanted the chance to do anything his skills could enable him to do, and not be limited by the ""unwritten rules"" of the time.

The only gripe I really have with the film is that in my opinion it is too short. After Syracuse wins the National Championship the next season is not portrayed. That said, the last few scenes are very poignant and well done.

I'd recommend this DVD to any football fan, especially college football fan.",1241913600,,2115,4.690026954177897
3276770,5,6303439136,"An exceptional story of America's first black recipient of the nation's highest college football honor--The Hesiman Trophy. The movie is a period film and not a documentary--such that its facts are altered to provide the viewer with a sense of the times---with discrimination the issue of the day. The EXPRESS will become a classic over time...much as did Brian's Song, Rudi, and the Rockne Story staring Ron Reagan. This is a captivating story of its time--the late 50's. Syracuse University was a leader in American sports integration as was their Hall of Fame and legendary Coach, Ben Schwartwalder--recrutiing Jim Brown, Ernie Davis, Floyd Little, and many other athletes of diverse backgrounds.

If that is all you know about Ernie Davis then this will be a fantastic movie for you to watch.  I am a sports fan and either didn't remember and didn't know pretty much everything about his story and it was a solid show from start to finish.  This is based off a true story and because of that the movie became so much more real.

The movie is rated PG, to be honest the language was harsh for a PG.  The movie was a great football movie and got a little political but enough to prove the point of what was happening with racial tension during the day.  It did not get into the politics of the issue and I thought that was great.  Dennis Quaid played a great role as coach in the movie too.  It is well worth the time spent watching!",1236470400,,856,4.1454545454545455
3276776,5,6303439136,"The Express is the story of Syracuse running back Ernie Davis. Davis followed the great Jim Brown and played for Syracuse in the late 1950s. Davis might have been even better that Jim Brown. Davis led his team to a national championship and became the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy.

This is a another feel-good racism sports movie along the lines of Meet the Titans or Glory Road. I say ""feel-good"" because the harsh realities of American racism in the late 1950s are explored and covered, but racism's true graphic and intense nature is never displayed.

Ernie Davis was always an optimistic man. He was one of a few minorities on campus and on the team, yet he was always kind to everyone. This movie made even better because most people haven't heard of Davis. He died tragically at the age of 23 from lukemia. He is truly a man that deserves to be honored in a movie like this.

The football scenes are top notch. Dennis Quaid is great as the Orangemen coach. The period settings really capture the feel of the time this movie was based in. On a downside, after watching the film, I still don't feel I know who Ernie Davis was, other than a man who battled racism. I wish the movie could have explored his personal life more.

I'm only 36 and thankful I've grown up in a time and location where racism has not been a part of my life. This movie pays homage to a man who broke the color barrier when it wasn't easy and made it possible for a man who is also African American to become president of the United States.",1234915200,19,1539,4.389473684210526
