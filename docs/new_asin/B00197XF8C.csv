8272403,3,B00197XF8C,"I already reviewed this product under another link here, but this instance of the product is priced more than double than the version I purchased, which slightly impacts my review.

In the late 1980's, there was a marine documentary series on Canadian television called ""The Last Frontier"".  The series ran for four years (1987-1990) and consisted of about 100 half-hour episodes.

The shows were geared to a broad market -- from younger to older, from novice to expert, and from all areas of interest.  As a result, every episode covered a variety of aspects (sea life, man-made objects, technology, ecology, local cultures, diving (prep, execution, discussion), etc.).

Each half-hour (allowing for commercials) only amounted to 20-25 minutes of actual program.  In order to relate a complete stand-alone story within that timeframe, most of the material was covered at a somewhat general level.

In 2011, collections of some of these episodes have been grouped, by theme, into three sets:  ""Shipwrecks: Graveyards Of The Deep"", ""Oceans Alive: Kingdom Of The Coral Reef"", and ""Predators From The Deep: The Ocean's Silent Killers"".  Each set consists of 5 single-sided DVDs, seated in a folded cardboard container, packaged in a decorative metal tin, along with a small overview booklet -- each DVD contains 4 ""theme"" episodes and 1 bonus ""non-theme"" episode -- yielding 20 ""theme"" episodes and 5 bonus ""non-theme"" episodes per set.  [Owning all three sets would give you 75 different episodes of the series -- a full 3/4 of the series!]

[Please note:  There is also a set of DVDs available titled ""Ocean Wonders"" -- this set consists of the first three DVDs found in the ""Oceans Alive: kingdom Of The Coral Reef"" set.  There is also a set titled ""Killers Of The Deep"", which consists of the first three DVDs found in the ""Predators From The Deep: The Ocean's Silent Killers"" set.  So keep this in mind, to avoid accidentally duplicating content in your purchases!]

None of the audio, nor video, content has been 're-mastered"" nor enhanced in any way -- as a result, these performances will feel aged, compared to most modern content being made available.  Equally, the science, technology, fashions, and perspectives are now nearly 30 years old, so this should be kept in mind when determining your reason for purchasing these sets.

I purchased the Shipwrecks: Graveyards Of The Deep collection without the above knowledge and was a little disappointed, as I expected the content to almost exclusively cover shipwrecks, and in somewhat more detail.  I was also unaware of the aged aspects of the presentation, which came as a surprise.  With that realization, I watched all of the episodes and found them very entertaining and perfect for fitting into allotted time constraints.  It enticed me to purchase the other sets as well.  The bargain pricing for this volume of content is very nice.

When the new product cost half the current price, my review stated:  A 5-star scale limits a fair indication of the product.  3 stars must mean that the product is neither good, nor bad. I was slightly disappointed that there was not more information about the shipwrecks, but on their own merit I still enjoyed them thoroughly, so I must choose higher than a 3.  A 5 means that it can't be better -- but if someone were to ""remaster"" the audio and video, the experience would be improved considerably, so that leaves 4.  The increased price of this product causes me to reduce my rating of the object -- sadly with a 5-star rating, this difference cannot be seen, as I still feel I must rate it as 4 for the product's merits. But due to the insolence of such high pricing, I feel that a 3 rating is mandated here -- I like the content, but it is not worth it at this price, but I want it clear to everyone that the biggest issue to me is the price, and not the product.

With the doubled cost of this product, on a 10-point scale, on its own merits, I would currently rate this as a 6 (instead of 7, as I had when the new product was at half this price), as I feel the quality does not merit such a high cost, in spite of the volume of the content.

8272405,2,B00197XF8C,"This is a retread of the 1985-1989 series 'The Last Frontier', filled with ludicrous staged photography (such as the so-called four-day-old toxic wreck covered in three years of marine growth) and Canadian divers wearing decades-old, obsolete scuba gear. And given the title ""Shipwrecks"", you might be led to believe the majority of footage would show them: such is not the case. Generously packaged in an heavy fiberboard DVD case enclosed inside an attractive metal box (with small booklet), it might make a reasonable gift for someone who either does not dive, or else someone who must have everything dive-related no matter how obscure.",1439337600,,640,5.223300970873787
8272406,2,B00197XF8C,"its from the late 70s or early 80ds video , not worth the money , very little on ship wrecks..nice photo on the tin box..",1354060800,,121,3.88
8272407,1,B00197XF8C,"Well packaged.  More about diving, the environment, and the foundation that produced it than the shipwrecks.  This is definitely not what I expected with regards to the level of information on the shipwrecks, the reason I bought it.  The production is not at a BBC quality level to be sure.",1248134400,2,290,4.76
8272408,1,B00197XF8C,"The product was received in damaged packaging, the metal container was dented and the plastic wrap was torn.  The DVD's were interesting.",1237680000,,137,5.2272727272727275
8272409,4,B00197XF8C,"This 5-Disc set is packaged beautifully and great value for the money.  The episodes (which I'm guessing are from the early 90's, so keep in mind that it's not HD, and beware of the ugly sweaters) are just about their dives and the current status of the shipwrecks, not history of the ships themselves. I would have loved a little history on the shipwrecks.  Overall, It's entertaining and a great buy.",1232841600,2,402,4.647887323943662
8272410,4,B00197XF8C,"I find just about anything that has to do with the sea,particularly under,I find very interesting. This DVD set is loaded with episodes of shipwrecks,old and new,sealife and the not so good things thats going on the the worlds oceans and so on. Very informative. Each disc,and there are 5 of them has 4 episodes on them and also bonus episode on each disc and other bonus features. This is very simular to Jacques Cousteau shows. The price is very reasonable too if you consider how many discs there are. I do recommend it. It's not a bad buy at all!!!!",1231286400,2,553,4.485148514851486
