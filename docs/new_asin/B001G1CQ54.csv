8326442,5,B001G1CQ54,"I've been subscribing to the video podcast for quite a while now, and I'm always excited when a new one comes out.  These shows are beautifully photographed and Scott Sloane, the host, is personable and friendly, the kind of guy you might sit down and have a beer (or a coffee) with.  My only complaint is that the shows, since they are podcasts, are brief.  When Alaska HDTV becomes a full-fledged TV show this fall I hope the segments become longer.",1251072000,,451,4.54320987654321
