2814514,3,B000P7V4MG,"That is a quote from the film and might explain the lack of extras in this movie. This film is one I was not sure about as it has attracted such diverse and strong opinions. I am a fan of war films and as such decided to see for myself, and I must say that most of the accusations are sadly, correct. This is a low budget attempt to make a landmark book (same name written by `William March' a pseudonym and published in 1933). I think that is where the film falls down the book is a collection of stories about all the soldiers. And was actually serialised, the film attempts to do this for much of the time. By so doing it has a stop, start feel that acts as a barrier to engaging the audience. As soon as any level of empathy builds up, the story is over and we are asked to engage again with anew character.

His autobiographical self sort of tries to hold the whole thing together, but the constant plot holes and lack of any sort of chemistry is a constant deal breaker. Many have complained about the set, and once again they are right. This is supposed to be 1917 to 18, and by this time the battlefields were a mass of mud and detritus. This seems to have been filmed in semi pristine conditions, with only a nod at realism with a fake looking skeleton, half buried in the soil (not mud). The special effects are neither special nor effective and what `action' there is passes quickly and is done in an unconvincing fashion.

 **Bit of a plot spoiler coming up**. There is also a couple of very weird scenes, including a `Jesus' type appearance and a conversation with a ghost of a German he bayoneted to death, I know Mr March had a nervous breakdown and so his ghosts were probably very real. However, and this is a big however, if the film makers wanted to express this side of war, then the film should have done more about it and not been posited as a war film per se.

It is shot in colour with some monochrome scenes and original WW I footage, but if I were to attribute a real colour to this film, it would be grey. There is also some German and French dialogue, but no sub titles, but it is all basic stuff so I was fine with that, but it annoys some people. As others have said there are much better WW I films like `Beneath Hill 60' or `The Lost Battalion', or you could actually read the original book.",1306108800,2,2323,4.201793721973094
2814515,1,B000P7V4MG,"First off, if you cannot tell, it's a very low budget film. Now don't get me wrong, there are low-budget gems out there like ""Saints and Soldiers"", which was made for less then 2 million and was actually a rather enjoyable film. This film however is not only loaded with poor acting, but many other shortfalls. The uniforms are not correct by anymeans, there is NO mud at all, the trenches look like they were literally made that morning and would fall in on themselves with a strong breeze. Lets not forget that the uniforms were always kept spotless during the film as if the director couldn't afford to dryclean them or he rented them and the weather was ALWAYS sunny!

I do NOT recommend this movie on ANY level. If you're interested in the story then buy the book written by the soldier who wrote it... not some half-assed interpretation by this director. If I could return this DVD I would!

PASSCHENDAELE and/or All Quiet on the Western Front are both miles above this film for a WWI flick...",1304294400,4,999,4.544444444444444
2814516,5,B000P7V4MG,I really enjoyed this book. I have wanted it for some time and was finally able to buy because the seller was selling this item for a great price. Thank you.,1294704000,,157,4.096774193548387
2814517,1,B000P7V4MG,"This movie fails on every level.

First, because of the low budget they were unable to hire enough extras, build/rent enough period military equipment and, most importantly, recreate WWI battlefield scenes with even a modicum of realism.  The trenches are too clean and too obviously fresh to be authentic.  You don't see any of the litter or wear and tear you see in any frontline position after it has been occupied for even a few days.

Second, the acting is terrible, like they hired a bunch of guys from a community theater.  The reaction of the young, Ivy League-educated officer to the deaths of his men caused by a stupid order on his part was one of the more egregious bad acting moments.  And there weren't any good ones.

Third, much of what happens is unrealistic.  The company portrayed in this film is the most incompetent bunch I've ever seen on film.  A scene in which two guys are walking through the German-infested woods just chatting away left me dumbfounded (at least they had their rifles at the ready).  There are many other such incidents in the film where you see inadvertent examples of incompetence (i.e., the director did not realize he was crafting a scene in which the actors are doing things that either simply would not have happened or, if they did, would have been so far outside the norm that it would require some explanation).  You have to wonder if ANYONE connected with making this film had ever served in the military.

Fourth, and most damaging, the movie gets many basic details wrong.  The highest ranking sergeant in the company, who would probably be at least a gunnery sergeant, is only a sergeant (i.e., three stripes/chevrons) and is grossly overweight for a WWI-era senior Marine NCO.  (Perhaps due to a rapid expansion of the USMC with the onset of war?  We don't know and it isn't explained.)  The Marines at several points refer to themselves as soldiers, which no Marine would ever do.

And finally, in one of the most important scenes of the movie, a letter to a fallen Marine's family telling the truth about his death is thrown into the fire but we see on the letterhead ""United States Army.""  Now how do you get that wrong?  These kinds of basic and easily avoidable mistakes destroyed the movie's credibility.

If you are anti-war and on the left side of the political spectrum at least this movie shares your ideology but it's no Platoon or All Quiet on the Western Front.  Compare Company K to Band of Brothers, which has a roughly similar format, and you can see what Company K could have been if it had been in competent hands.",1293926400,11,2589,4.6461538461538465

2814519,1,B000P7V4MG,"The best I can say about this film is that it is quite simply awful.  It displays the American Great War soldier as a cold blooded psychopath, idiot blue-blood, cruel southerner, well you get the idea.  The characters are cliched monsters that only a ""hate America first"" mind could generate.
Atrocities occur in all wars but to depict the Yanks as universally deranged and emotionally depraved is nothing less than propaganda.

2814521,5,B000P7V4MG,"While this movie was obviously made on a budget, it's done remarkably well.  The story consists of a series of quick looks at the soldiers in question and thus it's a bit different, but it's very well done.  The uniforms and equipment are a lot better than I've seen in most big budget flicks - I suspect they used a lot of WWI reenactors that knew their stuff.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE!",1233100800,3,389,4.375
2814522,5,B000P7V4MG,"This is one of the great anti-war films, along with All's Quiet On The Western Front and Die Bruecke (The Bridge -- which is still not available on DVD).  It has great acting from dozens of actors, without a single star in the cast.  This is a powerful and poetic film, with beautiful photography -- many of the screen compositions are worthy of the great masters, Eisenstein, Dreyer, Hitchcock....
Company K consists entirely of vignettes, some of which are very short ... and unforgettable.  It is commendably devoid of sentimentality, sensationalism, propagandistic jingoism, and the usual war-movie cliches.  Some of the episodes are tragic and shocking: American soldiers are ordered to kill defenceless prisoners of war.  A sleep-deprived soldier murders his superior officer.  A decent soldier, the narrator, kills a friendly German.  A piggish sergeant executes a young soldier -- who was not insubordinate, but simply too frightened to move.
The senseless carnage of World War I.  The message of this film, and the novel it is based on, is that these things must never happen again.  But they did happen again, and are happening now.",1222128000,33,1142,5.096774193548387
2814523,4,B000P7V4MG,"This is a hard film to adjust to as it carries you through the war experence of a person who wrote a book from which this film is taken. Its not the typical story because of the excerps of individual members of Company K. It is slow moving compared to most war films and spends as much time on personel than on battle sequents. It's a moving story that is not for the faint of heart & brings out the worst of men under wars battle conditions. Even though the events took place in World War One, it holds true for our wars now. I would not recommend it to the average war buff because of it's pace and some of the events shown. All in all ,I enjoyed it. Don't expect it to leave you with a good feeling. It was well done and the acting was good with no big names. I was disappointed because there was not more battle footage, but to each his own.",1219708800,63,845,4.035714285714286

2814529,1,B000P7V4MG,"Don't waste your time and money with this. Buy/see Raymond Bernard's Wooden Crosses or All Quiet on the Western Front, or even the recent romance films from this period. While I do have reservations about ""Lost Battalion"" it still is a far better film than this. My point: I am a World War 1 reenactor, and the main lesson I take from that is the constant and nerve wracking tension of battle stress. If you read soldier memoirs it so deeply affects those guys. In most scenes that tension is not evident. I suppose that is just bad acting and production. There are a few bright spots, but mostly it is dull. In addition, the setting at Newville where we reenact is far more authentic than the settings in the film. This plays too much like reenactors playing at war in hastily constructed movie sets, rather than giving the viewer any deeper sense of the reality of this brutal and dehumanizing war. War is by nature atrocity, and we have plenty of reminders throughout history of that. None of this surprises us anymore, so a film that focuses on that is harder to grasp without the ever present crushing tension, which needs to permeate the whole film. Perhaps that is hard to sustain since the film is broken into short vignettes, so the chapter breaks disrupt the continuity. There is one exception, the soldier who is so fatigued he ends up killing his CO, almost by accident. Overall, this was poorly done, and if anything, because it was such a dis-service to William March's memoir, it probably merits reading his book, to do him any justice. In addition, my disk was defective, but no matter, so was the whole film. I do not recommend it. If you feel like I do, then it will probably just end up in the trash bin.",1452297600,2,1723,4.5256410256410255

2814543,1,B000P7V4MG,"Your typical low budget, ""we only have five guys to work with"" flick.  Costumes (really can't call them uniforms) are downright goofy: a short-sleeve shirt (sorry, didn't exist in 1917) with a tie... the dreaded ""Denny's manager"" look!  And of course, those silly campaign hats you get at the surplus for $30, which are vastly different inappearance from the originals made by Stetson. The plot: there isn't one.  The characters are shallow, there's the ""new looey"" that issues senseless orders, the enormously fat Sgt who yells at people, and they alternate maddeningly between calling themselves ""soldiers"" and ""Marines""... well which IS it??  I'm guessing it was shot at the WWI site in Newville, PA, which is one of the better parts of the film.  In one combat scene, they engage some German trench raiders at night, one German being armed with that gun that looks like an MP-28 (forget the name... Irma?  Bergman?  I dunno, sumthin'...)... easily the best scene in the whole movie.  The scene where they execute German POWs a'la Band of Brothers was total BS, and makes the doughboys of the Great War look like the the Vietnam-era grunts that perpetrated the My Lai Massacre... shame on the director for allowing that to get in the movie.
