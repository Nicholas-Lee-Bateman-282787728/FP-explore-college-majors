8519817,4,B007O4B158,"I was born at the end of 1944, when WW II had eight months to go. In that time, Audie Murphy, short and baby-faced Texan, became the most decorated soldier of the entire war. That fame led to acting offers in Hollywood and he had a ""B"" movie career, mostly in low-budget westerns. Audie became one of my childhood screen heroes, however, and I still enjoy his films today. ""Sundown"" is most interesting to most fans because of the fascinating villain played by Barry Sullivan, and I do admire his characterization of outlaw Jim Flood, but I wanted the movie for a different reason---it is the only film I am aware of that has a scene supposedly set in a New Mexico town I lived in for 29 years, Hobbs, only six miles from the Texas border. Of course, the film shows characters from perhaps the 1880's, while Hobbs wasn't even a crossroads until 1908 and not big enough to have a saloon until the oil boom of the 1920's. And there are no Joshua trees in that part of NM, and no snow-capped mountains, and no forests on the non-existent slopes of such mountains. I think it was filmed in California, and my guess is that the screenwriter opened a U.S. atlas and just picked West Texas and NM towns and features he liked the sound of...so ""Big Bend"" is mentioned, the ""Llano Estacado"" (staked plains near Lubbock) are mentioned, the Texas city of Big Spring gets a nod, and scenes are set in ""Sterling"" which actually is Sterling City, between Midland and San Angelo, TX. The alleged Hobbs scene takes place entirely in a saloon, and really, this western as a whole is maybe 2.5 stars in a fair rating system. But Audie is good, Barry is great, and the usual gang of cowboy character actors are on hand as well. An even better Murphy outing is ""No Name on the Bullet"" should you be interested in seeing more Audie westerns.",1518220800,,1820,4.468468468468468

8519822,4,B007O4B158,"this is one of Audie Murphy's best films - so good it almost feels like an A movie

in part - this has to do with the vistas - they rival those of John Ford's - except this is directed by Harry Keller with cinematography by Ellis Carter - Keller directed another visually stunning Audie Murphy film -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SIX-BLACK-HORSES-Region-2/dp/B002PNRZR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SIX BLACK HORSES [Region 2</a>]

while the plot is the old ""get the prisoner back alive"" one - the script is often literate and funny - making the prisoner extremely personable - a character brought to life by veteran actor Barry Sullivan - who is even more suave and likable than Dan Duryea in similar roles in other Audie westerns - add grandfatherly John McIntyre as the veteran Texas Ranger - and Audie could merely coast thru the film - by this time - he had mastered the persona he generally brought to the screen - and was a amiable & comfortable actor

while pretty Venetia Stevenson makes an undistinguished love interest - two actresses score in brief scenes as saloon girls - the beautiful brunette Suzanne Lloyd - and especially - the sexy blonde Claudia Barrett in another scene

i have a couple gripes i want to get off my chest - the wound & blood trickle caused by the Winchester is awfully tiny - and why did the Ranger continually ride ahead of the prisoner where he couldn't watch him

still - SEVEN is a fun film - that might have been even better - if a little more imagination had been put into it",1349913600,2,1562,4.835205992509363
8519823,5,B007O4B158,"There is not much I can say about this movie except it is as good as any other Audie Murphy western you've seen i.e.  No name on the Bullet, The Duel at Silver Creek, etc. There is nothing more to add from the movie description: Seven Ways from Sundown Jones (Murphy), joins the Texas Rangers, and his first assignment is to capture Jim Flood (Barry Sullivan), a outlaw who eluded the law for years. On the way back to the Ranger station the two develop a close relationship - during this bonding period Flood (Sullivan) passes up several chances to get away. The only problem with this as well as many other Murphy westerns is they are unavailable on either DVD or even old VHS.  The rare ones that are on DVD are [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - France].",1344470400,2,762,4.359154929577465
