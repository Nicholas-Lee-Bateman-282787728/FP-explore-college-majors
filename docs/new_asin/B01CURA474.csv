7690910,5,B01CURA474,"This movie is fantastic! It tells the story of two young children, a brother and sister, on the run from Roman soldiers. They meet Mary at a well, who introduces them to her son, Jesus. They teach the children about faith, repentance and baptism. The children feel remorse for some decisions they've made and also learn about forgiveness. The ending is inspiring and heartwarming. It's a powerful movie that is only 24 minutes long and is perfect for the entire family!",1459728000,2,469,4.802469135802469
7690911,5,B01CURA474,"THIS WAS SUCH AN AWESOM, TOUCHING FILM! IT WAS A HALF KOUR MORE THAN WELL-SPENT!

ROMAN SOLDIIERS SEARCH FOR TWO YOUNG KIDS WHILE MORE IMPORTANT INDIVIDALS SEARCH FOR WAYS TO HELP THE CHILDREN TO GROW TO BECOME WORTHWHILE CITIZENS.

IT IS THE BEGINNING OF THE END THEN TO THE BEGINNING!(CONTEMPLATE THE MEANING OF THAT LAST STATEMENT!)

THE ACTING OF EACH CHARACTER INVOLVED WAS OUTSTANDING! THE BACKGROUND WAS GENUINE AND VERY BREATHTAKING. THE ONLY BRIEF PROBLEM AT THE VERY BEGINNING IS WHEN TH HIDING PLACE WAS UNAVOIDABLY RIGHT NEXT TO THE SOLDIERS PASSING BY THEM. THERE IS NO WAY THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SEEN. OTHER THAN THAT, IT WAS EXCELLENT!

THIS FILM WAS SENT TO US IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW, OF WHICH WE HAVE GIVEN.",1458777600,,736,4.771653543307087
7690912,4,B01CURA474,"I loved the message in this video.  The Savior, Jesus Christ, teaches children about faith.  He teaches them to repent and to ""come unto Him.""

Mary and Samuel are running.  They believe all of their family to be dead and are trying to survive.  They take care of each other and love each other.

They have the fortune of running into Mary.  I loved the gentle nature that the actress portrayed.  The love that she showed two children is as I would imagine the nature of the Son of God.  The story is told maintain from the perspective of the children.  We are introduced to the Savior as they see him.

I was touched by this short film.  It is only 30 minutes in length.  I was given a link to view this film for free in exchange for an honest opinion.",1458604800,3,753,4.21830985915493
7690913,4,B01CURA474,"Come Unto Me is a short film with a good message and one worth seeing, especially this time of year when we are reflecting on the Savior's life and the sacrifice He made for all of us. I can't recall seeing any Biblical depictions of Mary and Jesus when He is an adult, so I enjoyed seeing their loving relationship portrayed. I suppose I haven't thought much of Mary past His childhood, so her outgoing nature in the film wasn't something I had in mind, but she was very kind and helped children in need. She was a good example. She and Jesus brought out the best in the children.

I watched Come Unto Me with my kids, and although my son's interest wasn't held, my daughter thought it was good. The consensus was that the acting was ok.

3.5 stars.",1458518400,,750,4.3120567375886525
7690914,5,B01CURA474,"This is a beautiful story of two young children who learn about the gospel first hand from Jesus and his mother, Mary.  They learn the first principles of the the gospel- Faith, Repentance, Baptism...  This story captivated my family as we watched it together.  It helps make the gospel more understandable for children while it touches a very tender place in the hearts of adults as well.  This helped me to imagine what it might have been like to walk and talk with Jesus myself.",1458000000,2,481,4.623529411764705

8754237,3,B01CURA474,"Darin Southam has portrayed Jesus very well in this movie and in ""He Knows My Name."" The later film had a much more captivating story line, unlike ""Come Unto Me"" which drags along between old English Bible quotes. Nevertheless, the point of the film is good.",1471219200,,258,4.630434782608695
