I guess that should be obvious since this is from a professional dance school in New York, but I just thought I'd warn off anyone who knows nothing about dance and just wants an exercise DVD. There's no warm-up, just a preview of the dance, and then a break down of the movements. I had to hit pause and advance on the slowest speed to get some of the steps, and it had taken me a few weeks to get the first twenty seconds down. It's really fun, even though I've no idea what I'm doing.",1212451200,18,575,4.142857142857143
