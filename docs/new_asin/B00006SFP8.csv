""Return to Treasure Island"" features all that and has the added plus of containing zero profanity. It is safe and enjoyable for all ages (well, probably too much fighting for small kids, but at least there's no gore).

I taped this wonderful 10-part mini-series off the Disney Channel back in the 80s. My husband, 2 sons, and I watched it over and over again until the tapes wore out. In recent years I have repeatedly checked on Amazon to see if it was out on DVD and always came up disappointed. Nothing was available except old, used video tapes. How could something this good just disappear? Finally, to my great joy, I found this series in DVD (3-disc set with all 10 episodes) on the UK Amazon site and I was able to see my husband's face light up on Christmas morning when he opened his gift.

I'm sure glad I bought this DVD set when I had the chance because I see that it's now unavailable again on the UK site (didn't last long!) except in high-priced re-sale. It never showed up on the American Amazon site because it still hasn't come out in region-1 format. We are an American family currently living overseas and all the DVD players are region-free here. Once we move back to the States, we will have to buy a region-free DVD player in order to play these DVDs since they are in region-2 format (not US format). Well, hopefully by then, ""Return to Treasure Island"" will be availble in region-1 format. When/if that happens I hope they will add subtitles. I love the pirate talk (so quirky and funny), but a lot of the dialogue is hard to understand. It would also be nice to have some bonus features (background info on the making of the movie). A series this good deserves first-class treatment!",1231200000,,1867,4.603603603603603
7973217,4,B00006SFP8,"The reason I gave this four stars is for four reasons: animation, music, story and characters.
The animation is a LOT better than other annoying Japanese shows, such as Pokemon. The people move a lot more in this movie. The computer-animated Zoids are very immpressive; it makes them look even more life-like.
The music is great too, it sounds like they actually put some work in it to make it fit in with the show.
The plot is, surprisingly, very easy to understand. They explain it clearly, so it's not hard to follow along.
The characters are cute and fit in with the movie very well. The names are easy to remember, unlike some other Japanese movies. No horrible violence in contained in this movie. The people simply shoot a big animal robot over and over untill it falls down, then its pilot comes out of it without so much as a scratch! My brothers watch this movie a lot, they are totally obsessed with it. I don't watch it much, but when I do, I find it very neat and interesting. You should get this! It's worth it. :-)",1045526400,,1029,4.421052631578948
7973218,5,B00006SFP8,"I started watching zoids from the first episode and I loved it. The story behind the phantom zoid, the shadowfox, intrigued me. If I picked a favorite zoid, this would be it. To make a long story short I loved this dvd  and was glad I bought it. I think all of the zoids episodes are all pretty decent so if you remeber one from somewhere, don't hesitate in buying it.",1040256000,,368,4.183098591549296
