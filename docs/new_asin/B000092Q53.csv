Make sure you look at how long it is before you buy the DVD.  I'm not saying it is too too short, but maybe for some people it is.  (Buy his later DVD ""Psalms, Hymns, Spiritual Songs"")",1126137600,5,350,3.9571428571428573

7988551,5,B000092Q53,"Listening to Donnie McClurkin is so moving and spiritual.  I can feel that his songs are from his heart.  About 8 yrs ago a girlfriend was visiting from Houston.  She asked to play her tape.  She had seen Mr McClurkin in person. I fell in love with his music.  She let me have the tape.  Last summer, my mother spoke of his performance on televison program and how enjoyable he is.  So, I surprised her with another tape of his.  She loved it, and, id asking about another one  :)",1361664000,,480,4.2444444444444445

7988554,5,B000092Q53,"This DVD is awesome!  I usually listen to it while getting ready for work in the early mornings.  As a school administrator, it spiritually prepares me for my hectic and very busy days.  I think Donnie is a very talented and ""God connected"" individual.  His music crosses genres and invites those who don't customarily listen to gospel music to listen.  ...excellent CD!  You will thoroughly enjoy it.",1214956800,,401,4.91044776119403
7988555,5,B000092Q53,"I love Pastor Donnie McClurkin's music. He is one anointed man of God.

His vocals are just awesome. He's also a brilliant arranger and producer a nd he always works with the best of the best singers and musicians on his projects. I love all the tracks on this DVD but the two that get me every time are ""Create in Me a Clean Heart"" and ""Holy"" which feature some of the most incredibly beautiful choir arrangements that you will ever hear, at least until you get to Heaven. Seriously. Every time those tracks come around, that's it. I'm lost in the glorious Presence of God, again. Another song that stands out is ""You Can"". Halfway through the song a whole bunch of children come up on to the stage and join in with the choir and man, it's just so beautiful, powerful,prophetic. What a declaration of faith! I LOVE this DVD ! The backing singers are soooo good (it's Donnie's sisters and friends). If you get this and you like it can I suggest you also check out 'The McClurkin Family Project' which is awesome, and of course check out the rest of Donnie's projects. Plus Olivia has her own solo project which is great too. There's an audio CD entitled 'Again' and if you like this DVD,you should probably get the audio CD too because it features some incredible songs that aren't on the DVD.

Some people have criticesed this DVD for being too short ? Well, if you play it and it gets to the end and you want more,can I suggest you hit the 'Menu' button and then hit 'Play' and have another dose of 'Again' ! :-) Truly wonderful wonderful music. GET IT NOW !",1178668800,3,1560,4.375862068965517
7988556,5,B000092Q53,"I walked into a health food store and heard this VOICE and one song 'all I ever really wanted' and immediately became a fan. Overall, I think the albumn has a good collection of songs. One of the few albums where I enjoy EVERY song. Lyrics are inspiring, voice is sincere and powerful and conveys the message in the songs well. Hard not to sing along or even hum the tunes. Many of my friends whose first language is not English , enjoy this CD as well. My five year old son loves the songs as well,  especially the very upbeat 'yes you can'. Definately appeals to all ages and all nationalities.",1157846400,,596,4.321428571428571
