8484282,5,B005RHPBLY,"I spent the last 60 years looking for this pre-war aviation movie after seeing it on TV only once as a child in the early 1950s. The only known surviving 35mm print is now in the UCLA Film Library.  Here is a new DVD scanned from a 16mm print that dramatizes the Civilian Pilot Training Program created by the government in 1939 to build up a national cadre of pilots at colleges around the country prior to Pearl Harbor and the US entry into WW II. All the flying action in this movie is REAL, using vintage 1929 Stearman biplanes owned by the Chief Stunt Pilot for the film, Paul Mantz. This includes the breathtaking flights deep down inside the Grand Canyon and the climactic one-wheel emergency landing. Spencer Markee's service on this DVD is superb and well worth the price. Every aviation historian should have this DVD in their personal library",1357171200,8,853,4.6118421052631575
