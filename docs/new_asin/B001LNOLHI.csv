8318885,1,B001LNOLHI,This is not a good buy. This is a televised play and not a movie. I ordered this for Father's Day and was supposed to receive it by the day before and actually it arrived 3days after. This is in terrible condition and is NOT a DVD rather it's a DVD-R. Product description is horribly misleading.,1498348800,,295,4.285714285714286
8318886,4,B001LNOLHI,"Much has been said about the poor quality of the dvd with regard to the color saturation and ""washed out"" look. These are valid concerns. However, my review will focus on the quality of the production itself. From the beginning, it is clear that this adaptation of the Conan Doyle classic was shot on a shoestring budget. Baskerville Hall is clearly a small set, and you can tell the ""stone walls"" are merely paper. Well, we do as much as we can with what we have, no? Peter Cushing is EXCELLENT as Sherlock Holmes. His appearance and mannerisms suggest he was born to play the part. Nigel Stock lends solid support as the ever-faithful Dr. Watson. Stock plays Watson as a bit overwhelmed with the mystery of the hound, but he never sinks to the buffoonery that Nigel Bruce allowed the character in the original Rathbone series. The supporting cast are capable and do the material justice.

I must mention that I have collected many versions of ""The Hound of The Baskervilles,"" and each one takes poetic license with the material. Except this production! The 1968 version is perhaps the closest literal rendition of the story ever filmed! In fact, the screenwriter no doubt had an easy job of simply copying the dialogue from the story and placing it in the screenplay. The few liberties taken are small and do not detract from the story at all. I found this strict adherence to Conan's source material to be a very pleasant surprise, as I had come to expect ""surprises"" with each viewing of a different version. I whole-heartedly recommend this outstanding version!",1448236800,,1566,4.757352941176471
8318887,5,B001LNOLHI,"The plot is, of course, excellent and the adaptation is of the highest quality, even if it dates back to 1968.",1355875200,,110,4.285714285714286
