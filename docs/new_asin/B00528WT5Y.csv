4529420,4,B00528WT5Y,"Being that I already own the four individual seasons of this fun series on DVD I will pass on this collection. It would have been nice if Sony had added another disc and included the short lived Bobby Sherman series titled Getting Together (which was spawned from an episode of the Partridge Family). Also it would have been fun to have old network promos the cast did, out takes, bloopers etc. Anything extra. Seems the studios have no imagination anymore when they release these shows. That being said, I guess we all need to be grateful that they are still putting these out on real DVDs and NOT the crummy Made On Demand DVD-R's. So, if you don't already own the other season specific DVD's, I highly recommend this set, but if you are a life long fan of the show as I am, there is nothing new for you here.",1381795200,7,811,4.377483443708609

I doubt it for over forty years we've been hanging out for the unreleased songs, we got a small hand full and major rehash of the others which have be re released so many times it's not funny!  It's been what! Eight years since the last (season 4) was released and even then as with season 3 Sony cut the extra's such as go to musical performance.  If this is just a standard re issue in a special wrapper they are wasting their time and money not ours.  The two new*  album releases  the very best of the partridge family (same title as the album that was released  nearly 10 years ago with 3 or 4 of the unreleased songs.  Then there's the album called Best of 26 by the partridge family , one that is advertised but no one seems to have any information as to what tracks there are?

4529537,5,B00528WT5Y,"Yes, the discs are stacked on top of each other, and you need to carefully stack them as you play them on the cardboard spindle cover. Seasons 1 and 2, forget if 3, have the choice to select just playing the song portion of the episodes.  Special features are light and only on season 1.  YES, the Bobby Sherman episode IS EDITED, so the tag at end with him driving off to begin his very short lived series is sadly removed.  Season 4 is still good, but they clearly ""jumped the shark"".  The plots and songs still good.  But the producer that included the cute, but COMPLETELY tone deaf small boy to be incld. into EVERY episode singing a very cringe worthy song, should be quietly committed to an asylum.
As I come to a close, about to watch the last disc on season 4, I've secured the entire PF song library on CD via Amazon & ebay for the VERY HARD TO GET ""Bulletin Board"" album!  Only on Collector's Choice music catalog, was a VERY limited release manufactured. There has NEVER been an official CD release.  1 guy on Amazon has it for sale new, for over 1,000.00+!  I found a guy on Ebay that had 4, sold 2, and I just scored a copy for $30.00 yesterday!

4529539,5,B00528WT5Y,"This is a very nice series, wholesome family entertainment and comedy without the kids disrespecting the adults or vice versa. The picture quality is very good. What I most enjoy about this series is the early 70s clothes and semi-hip hairstyles (not quite as wild as real life hair back then !)  and also the street scenes. I get to play ""name that car "" when they are cruising somewhere. All in all, a fine ""trip"" down memory lane !  Buy this, sit back, watch, and return to the simple seventies !",1446768000,2,499,4.413043478260869

The lovable cast featured Shirley Jones, David Cassidy, Susan Dey, Danny Bonaduce, Suzanne Crough, Dave Madden, Jeremy Gelbwaks, and Brian Forster..

4529571,5,B00528WT5Y,"I agree that the entire series discs are stacked on top of each other and it is unfortunate. So I bought some cheap jewel cases to put the cds in. That solved that problem fairly easily.
I really enjoy this series. There's tremendous comfort in not having the constant high drama we see on trashy TV reality shows. The Partridge Family is well written and very funny. Shirley Jones chose the role of the mother, because she became the first working mother on a TV show. It was a pivotal moment in television history.
Every Friday night I ran home from my friends house down the street, just in time to watch The Brady Bunch and then The Partridge Family. Theses discs have given me wonderful memories again.",1437177600,,707,4.53125
4529572,5,B00528WT5Y,"Before I review the show, I would like to say that the DVD pack the show comes in is horrible. A simple, flimsy plastic tray with a spoke that holds all the disks. At least ""The Brady Bunch"" packaging provided individual ""sleeves"" per DVD.

I remember watching this show as a kid, but I always preferred the Brady clan for my 70's shenanigans. My daughter turned out to be a huge fan of the ""Brady Bunch"" as well, and as a hoot, I picked up the 1st season of ""The Partridge Family"" to show her. I thought she would groan at the first musical number and that would be it. Instead I popped in the first disk, and we were both hooked. ""The Partridge Family"" is outright funny, and the musical numbers are a blast!! After running through the first season, I came back to Amazon and saw that the whole series was less than purchasing each season individually, so I just grabbed the box set.

I will admit I came close to knocking 1 star off my review for Season 4. Not that the shows were horrible, but in about half the shows of season 4 you have to deal with Ricky Segall, he plays the little kid next-door neighbor of the Partridge Family, and he's just toxic!! It's a real head scratcher as to who thought this kid would improve the show, and more often than not, his scenes are just tacked onto episodes at the end (which does make it easy to skip!).

With that said, I had way too much fun re-visiting this show. This is a fun show, one that you should add to your collection. C'mon...get happy!",1436313600,4,1496,4.279151943462898

4529586,5,B00528WT5Y,"I watched this show back in the day and forgot how much I liked it! Good music and neat clothes too!! Just a simple, decent show for all ages. I would recommend it!! There are 12 DVDs in all but they come all stacked on top of each other, so that's not so good. You have to CAREFULLY (so as not to scratch them), take them all out if you want a certain one. Thin plastic holder has a deep well that all 12 DVDs sit in, then there is a piece of cardboard on top to keep them all in. Cardboard has a cut-out corner on one end so you can lift it out easier. Most people will find this annoying and a bad way to package so many DVDs (and it's true), but I am a very careful person with such things that it was ok for me. You could probably cut out some round, thin dividers to put in between the DVDs I suppose. Paper or material? You could transfer them to other DVD holders/cases  too. You don't have to be brutal when you take them out. Just be patient and gentle and you should be fine. I gave the show 5-stars but not so much the packaging.

4529588,5,B00528WT5Y,"VERY happy to FINALLY have the complete collection.  Fifteen years ago or so, I was able to purchase ten three-episode V.H.S. tapes from Columbia House which I loved, but were hardly a complete set.  The Partridge Family encompassed 96 episodes, so to only be able to obtain 30 episodes was annoying, but at least they were uncut versions.  In my area, growing up, I could watch an influx of The Brady Bunch, but The Partridge Family was rarely, infrequently broadcast and I never seemed to know when, in later decades, cable stations were running complete marathons.  I was able to painfully purchase other episodes sold on V.H.S. tapes by other companies, but again, I could NOT ever see the entire series.  I am thrilled and relieved to obtain the complete collection and can finally enjoy watching them decades after they'd originally aired.",1433721600,2,845,4.922535211267606
4529589,5,B00528WT5Y,"Yes, the packaging is cheap, but it keeps the price down on an entertaining series. I loved watching the reruns as a kid, and of course had dreams about the lovely Susan Dey. You'll love seeing the vast array of guest stars that went on to other things, like Jaclyn Smith, Farrah Fawcett, Richard Pryor, just to name a few. It's a worthy purchase.",1431820800,,347,4.4375
4529590,5,B00528WT5Y,"I never even saw this show on its original run, but used to watch its rival Brady Bunch.  I became a fan of Danny Bonaduce from the Smoking Gun / Tru-TV series ""World's Dumbest"", and read his book, and when I was stuck in the hospital last year, couldn't get TruTv and only thing on was Brady Bunch reruns and they were just.... awful.  So I took a chance and bought the Partridge Family series.  It's silly and hokey and as we all know the music is fake and played by actual top notch session musicians... adults.  But in terms of being hip and fun, it blows the square Brady Bunch away, and of  course it's all about Danny even in the early episodes.  I have worked my way through about half of season one.  Fun, short, easy break from some of the dull crap on TV nowadays.  And Shirley Jones still awesome too.",1431648000,,813,4.233766233766234

4529609,5,B00528WT5Y,"I purchased this after reading others' reviews.  Knowing the packaging was poor I put all the discs into a separate CD case and that will keep them protected.  This was a GREAT buy!  I can remember watching this show when I was just a pre-teen and falling for David Cassidy.  What a treat to have all these happy shows with their great music.  I only wish there were more of them.  With the complete series, you can see the changes over the years.  When you get to season 4 it seems the Partridges have remodeled their house (the gold shag carpet is gone) and everyone has a new hairstyle (Laurie went through quite a few styles before her final ""cut"" where her hair is the same length as Keith's).  But it's all good!  I completely forgot how hilarious Dave Madden (Reuben) was, but back then I watched the show for a glimpse of David.

Another really nice bonus is the special features at the beginning.  They include episodes with commentaries by Danny Bonaduce and Shirley Jones, as well as a bonus about the series and one about the music.  These were a nice surprise that you will enjoy.

I heartily recommend this series for anyone who wants to travel back to those Friday nights when we huddled around the TV, waiting for heartthrob David to appear and to see what that pest Danny was up to.  It's sure to make you ""get happy.""",1427587200,11,1335,4.440329218106996

Stacking all of the DVD's on top of each other is like something out of the era when CD's were first out on the market and everyone thought they wouldn't scratch. Hello, they do scratch. I am going to have to put extra money out of pocket to purchase cases to protect these DVD's. It is wrong to have to do so, but I do not want to buy this set again. In fact, I will not buy it again.

4529654,5,B00528WT5Y,"So much fun in a box for such a little price.  The presentation of the discs is rather annoying, all the discs are in one stack, instead of laid out over several ""pages"" as in other collections like this.  Timeless entertainment, exceptionally cheesy and as much fun as I remember! :)",1418428800,10,284,4.549019607843137
4529655,5,B00528WT5Y,"This is one of those shows that you either love it or hate it.  I was a child of the era (and earlier) and it was NOT one of the television shows I particularly liked - then.  But looking back you have a better appreciation for this sugar sweet fake music group family and their adventures.  What makes this set more appreciable are the extras that go into how the show began and other aspects of it.  It helps you get a better feel of what you are actually seeing on the screen.

Once again the packaging has been complained about but is a minor sacrifice to obtain the complete series at bargain prices from Sony!  I plan on buy more show series from them at these prices.  If you are careful with your DVDs like I am then there is no issue with packaging.",1418428800,2,758,4.186206896551724

4529666,5,B00528WT5Y,"If everyone in the world would watch this series as I do, the world would indeed be a happier place. I love the music and this family seems so real. Their hair, clothes, makeup, and overall grooviness makes me totally okay with the fact that a band would turn down professional classically trained adult percussionists who probably turned out in droves for a chance at a paying gig, to employ a 5 year old on tambourine and a 7 year old on drums. But it must have really worked after all, to the point of magically adding in background adult vocals, a horn section, strings,and at times even an effects pedal for guitar. Danny has absolutely no bass guitar skills, yet at every performance the people applaud the band quite happily. Keith and Laurie are teens in the mid 70's and they never once so much as smoke a cigarette or drink or get high,even though their bus looks like it was painted while on certain pharmaceuticals...And their manager never once hits on their single mom. So all of this does make me ""get happy"" when I take the time to watch it. Which is all day almost every day. I never leave my house anymore and I might have a hoarding problem now. I hope my employer hasn't replaced me.",1408924800,6,1203,4.447963800904978

It is a lot of fun. The packaging is a bit flimsy and the disks are one on top of the other, but all four seasons together cost less than buying each season individually so that is probably why!

4529684,5,B00528WT5Y,"I loved the Partridge Family growing up. We moved out of the country after the end of the second season. It was so much fun watching the entire series with my daughter. She and I both enjoyed the music from the first two seasons, but not so much the last two seasons. I'm so glad I bought it. One thing to note, the DVDs are stacked up on a center post, causing you to have to slide several on & off when trying to get to a DVD at the bottom of the post.",1394755200,,454,3.8404255319148937

4529687,3,B00528WT5Y,"I always liked this show, altho the the 4th season gets a little iffy for me. Ricky's ""singing"", and the saccharine-sweet Williams twins . . . whew!  Be aware however that the DVD case is as bad as they come, and that's saying something.  The box-case has one DVD 'well' with one spindle holding all 12 discs stacked on top of each other, with a cheap cardboard insert meant to be placed on top of the stack to hold them in place.  Not only is this single spindle made of poor thin plastic that crushes inward very easily rendering it almost worthless very quickly, but stacking all the discs on top of each other obviously allows the discs to be scuffed by each other.  This stacked arrangement also is extremely inconvenient for selecting and removing any particular disc, while trying to keep secure the ones removed from the top.",1393027200,75,833,4.570469798657718
4529688,5,B00528WT5Y,"Really impressive presentation although the packaging may come up a little short for many. The video quality i would rate B+ to A-. The audio quality is interesting in that they have it fixed dead center channel of the 5.1 spectrum. The audio is mixed into a high quality center channel mono, and even though i was a little disappointed initially i have found the sound to be quite impressive. There are some cool extras along with episodes including commentary so a great overall package,

Entertainment that the entire family can enjoy, and the writing is generally top notch. I really enjoy the family setting and there is some very enlightening information in the extras regarding the casting and just how the the Partridge family sound was created. As to the packaging, yes the discs are simply stacked together, but i will say that i have found it easy to re insert a disc back into the stack without feeling there is any potential for scratching or damaging the discs. I would say that this is one of the best 60s tv values out there. Come on get Happy!",1391126400,36,1060,4.608465608465608
4529689,4,B00528WT5Y,"The Partridge Family is a great nostalgic TV series about the trials of a Mother who to provide for her family formed a singing group.
  It is a bit odd that this group was chart toppers, but none really played their instruments, and only David & Shirley really did sing.
  From what I remember, David Cassidy did not want to do the series and did not enjoy it. So, Why did he agree to do it in the first place? It brought him fame and money, so he should have been grateful. I read of actors complaining and they have what most of us dream about. Sure their life changes as to security etc...but they will always be remembered.
  I received this item and was disappointed as it is a paper box with the disks inside stacked on top of each other...I thought it was like regular seasons in regular cases.",1390003200,3,802,4.2781456953642385
4529690,4,B00528WT5Y,"THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY-THE COMPLETE SERIES: Ultimately hipper than THE BRADY BUNCH, the kid-com it followed in the late sixties, THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY was based on real life hit making clan THE COWSILLS (INDIAN LAKE, HAIR), starring shag-a-delic heartthrob DAVID CASSIDY as KEITH PARTRIDGE and his real life step mom, Oscar winner SHIRLEY JONES. Managed by the easily exasperated RUEBEN KINKAID (DAVE MADDEN)...at least when DANNY BONADUCE's ""mental midget"" character DANNY wasn't usurping his authority...the cast also included SUSAN DEY as elder sister (and frequent CASSIDY sparring partner) LAURIE and low key moppets CHRIS and TRACEY, who rarely figured into the plot lines. Shuttling to supper club gigs in a multi-colored school bus, THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY dispensed their innocuous brand of bubble-pop...notably real life chart topper I THINK I LOVE YOU and a series of best selling albums (on which only CASSIDY and JONES performed)...to millions of young fans jonesing for a sugar fix ever since THE MONKEES' unceremonious cancellation a couple of years earlier.
