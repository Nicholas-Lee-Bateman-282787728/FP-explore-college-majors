5723119,1,B00CJ1CTZM,"The DVD first screen shows list of things it should have like steps, various teachers, etc. but they are not there.
I want my money back.",1375660800,5,137,4.3076923076923075
5723120,5,B00CJ1CTZM,Love it great work out if you follow along this is the best purchase if you can not afford the entire system.,1374192000,10,109,4.0
5723121,4,B00CJ1CTZM,I usually do the Zumba Rush workout on the Xbox. This was a good substitute while we were on vacation,1373155200,4,101,4.1
5723122,1,B00CJ1CTZM,"No instructions, hard to follow. I bought it because someone left a revue saying it was fun and easy to follow, its not.",1372982400,3,120,4.260869565217392
5723123,4,B00CJ1CTZM,"I love the music.  However, the demonstration portion of the video is just too short.  It is definitely a lot faster paced than I expected.",1372723200,5,139,4.52
5723124,5,B00CJ1CTZM,"It was really a supplement to my Saturday Zumba class. The workout that the DVD provides is almost as good as going to a class basically I sweat...a lot and enjoy the music.  Easy to follow, a win-win.  :)  Great investment!",1372723200,13,224,4.414634146341464
5723125,5,B00CJ1CTZM,There's individual instruction for the dance moves and multiple dance sessions to chose from. Very happy I found/ordered this dvd!,1368662400,23,130,5.55
5723128,4,B00CJ1CTZM,"Lots of different dances with step by step instruction - or you can do it without the instruction. Just know, that pretty much every dance is high impact, so if you can't do high impact workouts, this won't work for you. Other than that, it's a great workout with enough variation and options to keep you interested for a long time.",1395273600,,332,4.459016393442623
5723129,1,B00CJ1CTZM,"It was not what  I expected, I don't like salsa or merengue music I wanted belly dancing that is what it looked like by the picture on it, very disappointed",1393545600,,156,4.2
5723130,5,B00CJ1CTZM,"The DVD arrived in good condition.  The purchase made was for my girl so she could dance her way to a thinner self.  I must admit that I'm starting to see why this craze they call Zumba is making a difference.  My girl has only been working out to the DVD for over a few weeks now but she loves the DVD and she feels that she is getting a good work out and will continue to use the DVD.  So, if she likes the DVD, then I like the DVD.  LOL.",1393200000,,440,3.739130434782609
5723131,4,B00CJ1CTZM,"This Zumba DVD is a great introduction to different rhythm from around the world. Besides, it is a cheap and easy way to keep exercising at home.",1393113600,,145,4.407407407407407
5723132,4,B00CJ1CTZM,This was exactly what I was looking for to get acquainted with the Zumba phenomenon. It is enjoyable and easy to follow.,1393027200,,120,4.5
5723133,1,B00CJ1CTZM,"This seems like a bootleg copy that was made in someone's garage. No chapters.  So the only way to advance from dance one to dance 8 is to hit the fast forward and wait a really long time. Not impressed with the formatting. No option to view the dance from behind. Only see mirror view from the front.  Also, they run a little demo of steps first, then show you each dance. The variety of musical styles is nice, but overall this tape was extremely disappointing. I think I'll stick with my zumba classes and return this DVD.",1391558400,,525,4.346938775510204
5723134,5,B00CJ1CTZM,I love the mix of dance styles from many different cultures...it's a workout that I don't get bored with!  It's great to do when you can't make it to the gym/exercise class.,1391212800,,173,4.40625
5723135,1,B00CJ1CTZM,"This DVD seemed like it was made in someone garage. Very bootleg-like in quality. No chapters of any kind. So if you are on dance #1 and want to advance to #10, the only way to do it is by waiting and fast forwarding to get there. Not too impressed with the dances either. Demo is before, then they show the dance. No promps during the dance. No option to view from front or back.
 As much as I love my zumba class, I fear this purchase was a waste of my money. I will most likely return it.",1391040000,,491,3.95959595959596
5723136,5,B00CJ1CTZM,"I needed to workout in the comfort of my home and this DVD delivered a power-packed, energetic routine.  Awesome Zumba.",1388534400,6,119,4.95
5723137,2,B00CJ1CTZM,I was hoping for a DVD that it could use for Zumba when I couldn't use my Wii or PS3 Zumba versions. Very disappointed. More like a DVD of a variety of dance types to watch - NOT exercise.,1383177600,2,188,3.8461538461538463
8582336,3,B00CJ1CTZM,it is okay compared to others,1439337600,,29,4.0
8582337,4,B00CJ1CTZM,not bad but not what I was looking for.,1435795200,,39,3.4444444444444446
8582338,5,B00CJ1CTZM,I am happy with my purchase.,1432512000,,28,3.8333333333333335
8582339,4,B00CJ1CTZM,I really like this DVD. It's fun because it's a mix of all different types of dance and music and it breaks down the moves for you.  The only thing I would change is having them go a little slower and review the moves more before you launch into a routine.,1417564800,,256,4.019607843137255
8582340,4,B00CJ1CTZM,So far so good. Just not sure if the receiver of this present really use it much :(,1408233600,,83,3.6666666666666665
8582341,2,B00CJ1CTZM,While the ZUMBA disks are fun and that will inspire me to excercise it would help to increase the challenge or level of excercise to break a sweat and feel a burn.  I am looking for something to enjoy s that I will increase excercising but need to feel I am making some progress in losing weight and shaping up.  Maybe other tapes are more advanced.,1402876800,,349,4.2727272727272725
8582342,5,B00CJ1CTZM,I have to admit that I was skeptical at first. I do cardio and muscle toning videos regularly but Zumba seemed different and it is. It works the hips like nobody's business! The moves and music are addictive. I've finally reached my weight loss goal after doing Zumba. I highly recommend it.,1398384000,,291,4.615384615384615
8582343,1,B00CJ1CTZM,Some of the mix that was mentioned was not on the dvd. Also the dvd was copied not an original.,1398211200,3,95,3.8
8582344,2,B00CJ1CTZM,"I only did this dvd once.  I like Zumba, but this is just too frustrating to be helpful if one reason for exercising is to relieve stress.",1397520000,,138,4.111111111111111
8582345,4,B00CJ1CTZM,Cardio aspect is on the money and the variety of dance styles will not become boring because you have to learn each one while getting the workout you need.,1395964800,,155,4.379310344827586
