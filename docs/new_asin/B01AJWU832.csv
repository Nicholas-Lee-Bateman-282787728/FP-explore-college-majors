7606068,4,B01AJWU832,This movie was probably the best Expendable movie so far,1462233600,,56,4.7
7606069,5,B01AJWU832,The price was great. The order arrived on time and in the condition advertised. This is demo worthy with a Dolby Atmos 7.1 channel soundtrack and visual buffet on Bluray and 4K Ultra hd. Check it out,1461369600,,199,4.405405405405405
7606070,4,B01AJWU832,Definitely a fun and totally worth while movie to add to your 4K library!!! It doesn't hurt that the price is decent as well on this title!!!,1460678400,,141,4.2592592592592595

7606074,1,B01AJWU832,"I like this movie, and own the blu-ray version. But the UHD version from Lionsgate is poorly authored and not worth buying. The HDR blacks are actually about 5% grey, leaving the black letterbox visible and grey, but not black. Also if you stop the movie playback your display is left with HDR on more often than not. All these problems are due to poor HDR authoring by the studios. In this case (along with Ender'sGame) Lionsgate has produced two UHD discs that should be avoided at all costs.",1457568000,4,494,4.561797752808989
7606075,1,B01AJWU832,"The second disk, DVD not 4K, had a number of sound dropouts where nothing could be heard, neither the dialog nor the sound effects.  This is very disappointing for a Blu-ray offering.  I do not have a 4k machine or TV, so I was not able to assess the quality of that disk.  The packaging and online info states 4k, Blu-ray and Digital HD.  However, I only received two disks in the case and one was 4k while the other did not say blu-ray.  This discrepancy may be intentional or accidental, but it is misleading in either case.
The biggest disappointment was the sound problem!",1457049600,,577,4.457142857142857

7606095,5,B01AJWU832,"This is a great addition to the Expendables franchise, especially in 4K!  The film is totally action packed and filled with great chase scenes and action sequences.  If you loved the first two movies you will definitely be into this one.  And if you happen to have a 4K set up, even better.  The film pops with color and the Dolby Atmos soundtrack will rock your speakers.  Great fun, great movie!",1465689600,,397,4.535211267605634

8747577,1,B01AJWU832,"I have now bought 2 copies of this 4K UHD disc, the first is almost unwatchable - blue haze, no blacks, lousy color (Oppo UDP 203, Samsung 8000 UHD TV) the image on the second one was only marginally improved - flesh tones were often grey.  The movie looked better on the blu ray, which we put on to finish watching the movie.  Based on our experience cannot recommend buying the 4K version, unless we are the only unfortunate people to buy two bad copies of this movie?  This is not a review of the movie itself, read other reviews for that.",1499472000,3,542,4.294117647058823
