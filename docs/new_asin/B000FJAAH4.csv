2569525,5,B000FJAAH4,"I agree with many of the other reviews that this is indeed a good add to a real hip-hop fan's dvd collection, but like also stated in another review, I think they should've added wu-tang's solo music videos, and I personally think they should've added wu-tang's affiliate's music videos to this collection too or at least release a follow up to this dvd. Not to say that the dvd isn't good, but I think the solo videos would've made this collection even better. It's not often that you get a chance to see music videos like, ""GZA's Cold War,"" ""Raekwon's Glaciers of Ice, Incarcerated Scarfaces,"" ""Ghostface Killah's Camay,"" or any of Shyheim, Gravediggaz, or Killarmy, music videos on television, the only time you get a chance to see those rare videos are on video sharing websites, like YouTube, but to me that's not as good as being able to watch on dvd. You MAY just happen to get lucky one day and see SOME of these videos on tv, but you'll most likely see videos like those on satellite, and I know not everybody has satellite, so it would be nice if everybody could see videos like those rare ones on dvd, because the majority of the music channels are playing whatever is new, even if it means it's not good. That's why I would really hope whoever's in charge of putting out these dvds could consider doing one with the videos that weren't featured on this collection and any of those other rare 90s music videos. But besides that, I think this is really a good collection, I really like the interview with the majority of the members of the group from 1994, because you learn stuff about some of them, that you may have not known. So if your a real Wu-Tang fan, than I suggest you buy this collection.",1183766400,3,1710,4.483974358974359
2569526,5,B000FJAAH4,This is definatley something I would recommend to any die hard wu-tang fan. It's got the classic videos and extra commentary and video footage!,1173312000,2,143,5.0
2569527,5,B000FJAAH4,"This was a great DVD.  It compiles alot of Wu-Tang's popular videos and it has some great interviews and footage from a '94 performance.  There's alot more videos that we need to see on future DVD's (all their solo videos).  I hope they are planning to release all of them.  I remmember ""All I Need"" and ""Brooklyn Zoo"" being two of there most popular videos in terms of how much they were played on TV.  Regardless, this is good DVD to have and it's at a great affordable price.",1153872000,6,478,4.325842696629214
