8050184,1,B0007PFQ5M,"This 1998 documentary (sponsored by Honda) appears to have been made just before Honda or Toyota introduced their production hybrid cars and before GM decided to crush their EV1 electrics cars (See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-Killed-the-Electric-Car/dp/B000I5Y8FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who Killed the Electric Car?</a>).

About 30 of the 57 minutes are spent on a very general explanation of smog and the history of the American automobile. The remaining 27 minutes include segments on a guy who guts old Datsuns and sticks in electric motors, a New York cabbie who drives on natural gas, a competition amongst several universities to make a car that pollutes less and gets more miles per gallon, plus interviews with many experts.

Unfortunately, most of the material is now badly dated. You don't hear much about natural gas cars any more because the price of natural gas skyrocketed a few years back (as near as I can recall). You don't hear about any of the mainstream electric cars because they were all destroyed as soon as California backed down on their zero emission requirement.

The only thing ""on target"" is that the winner of the college competition was a hybrid, the only type of alternative vehicle you or I can go out and buy today, nine years later.

Save your money and go buy ""Who killed the electric car"". Oh, and BTW, the DVD wouldn't play on my most reliable Sony player, I had to try another.",1192838400,7,1471,5.220338983050848
