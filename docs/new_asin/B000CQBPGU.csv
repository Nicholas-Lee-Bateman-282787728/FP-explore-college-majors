2468956,2,B000CQBPGU,"""The Romantic Englishwoman, (1975), a 125 minute romantic drama, is an oddity in more ways than one among British films.  It is packed with stars of the time before and behind the camera, and yet has become obscure to the point that it is only now being released on DVD.  And released without subtitles, a penny-wise pound-foolish economy for a movie that has a presumably witty script by Oscar award winning screenwriter/playwright Tom Stoppard ( SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, BRAZIL, EMPIRE OF THE SUN), who was hot hot hot at the time.  But of course, my husband and I, though we were able to follow the main lines of the script easily enough, missed the entire dialog.

The film, which comes with a reputation for being incomprehensible anyway, as it is one of those once so popular explorations of `what is reality and what is fantasy,' is known in some quarters as LAST YEAR AT  BADEN BADEN, a play on Alain Resnais's film LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, another film about a spa that's similarly incomprehensible to many (including moi).  It was directed by the American Joseph Losey (THE SERVANT, THE GO-BETWEEN, MONSIEUR KLEIN), similarly hot hot hot at the time. (He had exiled himself to the United Kingdom, as he had been blacklisted for his Communist affiliations by Hollywood during the regrettable McCarthy years).

At this point the film may be best known as an obscure entry in the catalog of its two-time Oscar-winning star, Michael Caine (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001OGWY1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannah-and-Her-Sisters/dp/B00005O06J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannah and Her Sisters</a>).  He plays Lewis Fielding, middle-aged novelist with writers block.  His wife Elizabeth is played by two-time Oscar winner Glenda Jackson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hopscotch-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005JL3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hopscotch (The Criterion Collection)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunday-Bloody-Sunday/dp/B00009Y3NL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunday Bloody Sunday</a>). She has decided to go to the German spa Baden Baden.  There she becomes slightly acquainted with Thomas, a German would-be poet/drug dealer/ gigolo, played by the handsome German Helmut Berger (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather-Part-III/dp/B005DNPF7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather Part III</a>,).  But Lewis imagines Elizabeth's having an affair in Baden-Baden. Things get even dicier when Thomas shows up in the U.K., comes by for a rather comical literary chat (he credits Lewis with the centuries earlier work of that other Fielding, Henry, author of TOM JONES), and is hired by Lewis as his secretary.  Caine and Jackson both deliver powerhouse performances here, and, of course, Berger, who must share many scenes with them, isn't up to their standard, still, he keeps his head above water.  Other stars include Canadian-born Oscar nominee, once tipped to be a big star but never quite got there, Kate Nelligan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-of-the-Needle/dp/B000035P5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye of the Needle</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince-of-Tides/dp/B00005OLYF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince of Tides</a>).  She's substantially wasted in the small part of Isabel, Elizabeth's friend, where she principally gets yelled at by Lewis.  Also Michael Lonsdale (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Of-Gods-and-Men/dp/B0056AJMCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Of Gods and Men</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ronin/dp/B000RLFJQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ronin</a>), as Swan, an underworld associate of Thomas's.  Jackson gets to wear designer duds; the producers seem to have balanced the movie's costume budget by allotting only one, an odd-looking white suit and hat, to Lonsdale.

It surely is a 70s movie; it's bursting with browns. Sumptuous interiors, particularly in Baden Baden.  Many reflections in mirrors and windows.  Caine works at a partners' desk, with a Selectric.  Stoppard has snuck in an homage to CASABLANCA (is it possible that only I have noticed it?), when Elizabeth tells Thomas she has come to Baden-Baden for the water.  That's one of Humphrey Bogart's more famous lines in the earlier, Oscar-winning picture.  There's also an eerie precognition: a sculpture, apparently of Caine's hand, in the novelist's office.  (In 1981, Caine was to make THE HAND, a horror classic).

I can't honestly full-heartedly recommend this motion picture, but it may be an interesting one-shot viewing for fans of its stars, and their good acting, now that it's available on DVD.",1342828800,9,4964,6.696261682242991
2468957,3,B000CQBPGU,"With this cast, you would expect more.  But I guess a 30-year old movie (or more) would be a little boring.  The film tries to be a sexy, European ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe"" spin off, but doesn't quite make it.  Ah, like in some versions of Don Giovanni, the straying wife is forgiven in the end . . . Yawn!",1339632000,,313,4.098360655737705
2468958,3,B000CQBPGU,"Kino offers up a fine looking blu-ray version of this 1975 flop by ex-patriate American director Joseph Losey.  Based on the book by Thomas Wiseman, the story concerns the link between a writer's paranoid fantasies about the actual discontentment of his spouse.  Wiseman wrote the script, which was finalized by Tom Stoppard, who seems to have added some necessary humor to the art-imitates-life theme explored.  It is hard to accept Caine and Jackson as ever being in love, but it is great to watch their marriage deteriote as the psychosexual gameplan unfolds.  Helmut Berger, as the final member of the menage, does his usual, efficient gigolo bit, but is too humorless to be an effective catalyst.  Still, the film does succeed in merging imagination, memory and reality into an intriguing concept of romantic and sexual tension; best of all is the fresh, mean-spirited attitude the film has towards the bourgeoisie household.  Inspite of being an overall non-success in its time, a sophisticated love story like this is hard to find these days, so this blu-ray is definitely worth checking out.",1309046400,19,1099,5.0777777777777775

Suddenly overcome with jealousy, Lewis imagines his wife in a myriad of sordid situations, She returns to an atmosphere of tension and mistrust deepens when Thomas, a young German hustler whom Elizabeth met in Baden-Baden, comes into their lives.

2468963,4,B000CQBPGU,"I have watched this movie more than once, and always enjoyed it. Writers who mine their personal lives for material are asking for trouble--and Michael Caine, a successful novelist, does more than that--he  provokes his friends and family and finally goes too far in inviting a young poet into his home and throwing him together with his wife, played by Glenda Jackson. That the young poet (Helmut Berger) is actually a drug carrier in trouble with his bosses leads to disaster; that he and Jackson have actually done the physical act, whatever their intentions, proves that intimacy is a yoke that once assumed is impossible to discard. It's a glamorous film, a comedy-drama, with attractive actors (even in minor roles), and totally believable. I dare you to see it only once!",1449014400,4,778,4.938931297709924

2468976,5,B000CQBPGU,"The Romantic Englishwoman (Joseph Losey, 1975, 115).

>>>Caine plays a successful English novelist whose discontented wife, played by Jackson, decides to take a holiday to Germany in order to 'find herself'. There she meets an ambiguous young man, played by Berger, in an elevator, which initiates an often bizarre, but extremely mature examination of desire, responsibility and the nature of love. Wikipedia<<< While I gave the previous Losey review of Modesty Blaise the title Vitti Light, (Glenda) Jackson Light seems to fit this one, or then label both as Losey Lights! Michael Caine and Helmut Berger complete the actors trio, and Tom Stoppard and Thomas Wiseman provide a top screenplay. So a film full of heavies, from actors to screenplay, let alone Losey.

Glenda Jackson is the phenomenal actress as whom we know her; she can literally do anything well. Losey puts a seemingly lost Michael Caine at one and a seemingly knowledgeable Helmut Berger at the other end of her, and lets them spin their stories, as they both are story tellers anyway! They both, in their role, turn out below par, Glenda stays on top. And so does Losey!

It's extremely well acted, well written, and has an interesting premise -. but considering all the talent on board, it somewhat misses the mark. Tom Stoppard was a terrific writer and Joseph Losey made some wonderful films, but this doesn't have the power it could have had. However, if you loved 'Accident' and 'Sunday, Bloody Sunday' which are both way better than this - you will find it worth watching. It is witty though.

8100254,5,B000CQBPGU,"Wow: slightly sleazy cover for what comes across as a well-made, superbly acted, but oddly surreal offshoot of Seventies progressve film. But the cover might be right, how else to convey the oddness of this film? Kind of a mad mix between Theorem and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, but really making a place of its own.

I was gripped from the start by the narrative pull of this mysterious story. It's strange and has to be seen to be understood. It seems sometimes, that shock is inserted for shock's sake (aggressive dialogue, nudity, unconventional behaviour- to say the least); but ultimately it does work. The film IS about flouting conventions, about how to make more of life. There is the clever idea that Michael Caine, playing an author is writing scenarios as it all happens around them, or that they experiment with life as fodder for his bestsellers and a wealthy lifestyle. Meanwhile it explores themes like love V passion: Glenda Jackson undoubtedly loves Michael Caine - but it is not enough. And the roles are well-reversed to explore this, Glenda is more dominant and plays it well.

This film is so unusally intelligent / provocative and well filmed - nice surprise from the dusty archives.",1515369600,,1210,4.840579710144928
8100255,1,B000CQBPGU,"Review of The Romantic Englishwoman
Hot Toasty Rag, November 24, 2017

In the extremely strange and uninteresting The Romantic Englishwoman, a husbands suspicion of his wifes infidelity practically pushes her into doing it. The outline of the plot could have been turned into a comedy, but Tom Stoppard and Thomas Wisemans script is a drama. As a result, theres really nothing and nobody in the film to really care about.

Michael Caine and Glenda Jackson are the married couple, and every time shes out of his sight, he imagines that shes with another maneven though when they are together they cant keep their hands off each other and only get in small squabbles instead of real fights. Then, Helmut Berger appears, and even though hes a virtual stranger to Glenda, Michael cant help but practically push them together so that he can prove himself right. Its extremely silly, but not in a comical way. Unless you're a die-hard fan of Glenda Jackson and want to see her whip her clothes off in several scenes, I cant imagine anyone wanting to sit through this movie. The acting feels uninspired, the plot is beyond frustrating, and the characters are impossible to root for. Plus, Glenda Jackson always seems too angry to be likable.",1511481600,,1234,4.843601895734597
