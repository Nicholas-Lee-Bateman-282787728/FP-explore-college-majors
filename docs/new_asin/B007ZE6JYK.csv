8523388,5,B007ZE6JYK,"I bought this for the action movies I don't already have. The video and audio on all the movies are very good, so this is a good set and worth the money.",1395619200,,153,3.8125
8523389,5,B007ZE6JYK,"I've been watching a lot of Chuck Norris movies lately. My imagination seems to be going through a fantasy period and these movies provide fine high entertainment. I bought a set that has exactly these same four movies, but under a different cover. I found it in the bargain bin at Wall-Mart. Usually, four-packs such as this have one or two movies that I don't particularly care for, but all of these four were first rate. If you want my preferences, ""Missing in Action"" and ""Delta Force 2""  would be at the top followed closely by ""Code of Silence"" and with ""Hero and the Terror"" lagging a bit into fourth. I'd consider all to be first-rate action movies.

Chuck Norris is, well, Chuck Norris in all four movies. Violence, explosions, gunfire, gore and martial arts fill the action in every movie, although ""Hero and the Terror"" is at a somewhat slower speed. The body counts are high. The movies are well produced and proceed rapidly. Just sit down, relax and watch it unfold. There's no time to think about it. If you don't like a lot of violence and mayhem, then these aren't your kinda movies. Go watch ""Mary Poppins"" or something like that. If you like a lot of fighting, gunfire, explosions, destruction and mayhem, you've found the right highly entertaining four-pack of movies. All of the movies are individually reviewed by me and by many others. I gave ""Missing in Action"" and Delta Force 2"" five stars and ""Code of Silence"" and ""Hero and the Terror"" four stars. If you're more curious about any of the individual movies, I'd suggest looking them up.
