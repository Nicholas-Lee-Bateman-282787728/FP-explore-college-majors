8430560,5,B004IB048K,"I'm a rock and roll music lover, I don't care much for country music.  Johnny Reid's music doesn't sound country.  It's rock, soul, country and blues all rolled into one.  I saw him on PBS and was blown away, I've been buying his music ever since.  Too bad he ended up in the ""country"" category.....don't let it scare you away!",1331942400,,327,4.4
8430561,5,B004IB048K,"I saw Johnny Reid on PBS and immediately looked for his music on line.  His songs are positive, often romantic, and just make you feel good. In fact, I haven't found music that made me smile this much since The Beatles. He's a Scot/Canadian, and his music often has Celtic elements, which I love.  He's labeled as country, but his music doesn't sound usually country to me.  A few of his songs have a rockabilly feel.

Johnny seems to be wildly popular in Canada.  I wish he'd become more known in the US, because I'd love to see him in concert.",1328227200,,545,4.356435643564357

8430563,5,B004IB048K,Fantastic video! He's a unique blend of soul and country. When he tours the U.S. he will definitely be a hit! Check out his CDs as well for some great music that's not on the video.,1312675200,,181,4.055555555555555
