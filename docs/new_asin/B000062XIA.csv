7958058,1,B000062XIA,This action packed police story follows in the tradition of Cynthia Khan's famous In Line of Duty franchise but unlkie In Line of Duty suffers from disappointing martial arts choreography. If you're looking for kung fu action embedded in a police story give this one a miss and opt instead for In Line of Duty 4 -- which will give you greater satisfaction.,1355702400,2,356,4.666666666666667

7958060,3,B000062XIA,"In most ways this Image edition of ""Madam City Hunter"" is an improvement over the one previously available from Tai Seng. The widescreen image is anamorphically enhanced and sharp. Also, the English subtitles on this edition are much more accurate and easier to read than the previous version's burnt-in chinese-english subs.
BUT, on the negative side, this new Image version is dubbed into Mandarin Chinese whereas the Tai-Seng version was in the original Cantonese. This isn't a HUGE problem because most of the film consists of insane action visuals, but it is really annoying during scenes with dialog because the re-dubbing of Mandarin over Cantonese doesn't fit the actor's lip movements any better than English dubbing would have.
Would it have killed them to find a version in the original language?

Other than that, this nutty film is a treat for HK action fans and the picture is a great improvement over the previous Tai-Seng edition. Just keep in mind that this is a VERY bare-bones edition.",1181692800,6,1004,5.0119760479041915
