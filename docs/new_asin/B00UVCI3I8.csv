8708487,5,B00UVCI3I8,"As an instructor across multiple disciplines, I don't say it lightly that Kindness is Contagious may be my favorite documentary.  Dr. Fowler, David Gaz, and their team take a dive into what really makes us tick, delightfully and brilliantly weaving something that is part psychology, part sociology, part psychiatry, part raw human connection.  The animations and soundtrack make this powerful message even more robust.  It's a blast to show this in my classrooms, and my family loves it, too.",1513728000,,493,5.215189873417722
8708488,5,B00UVCI3I8,"Awesome Film! Well done. Validates what I have personally experienced. That living by faith, against our cultural self centered ways and giving without fear imparts peace and happiness. It does grow and expand. I like the virus analogy. Keep the message rolling! Thank you David Gaz.",1506124800,,283,5.173913043478261

8708491,3,B00UVCI3I8,"It's a lovely topic and a decent documentary with some nice moments, but for a movie about kindness it was not particularly moving or inspiring.
It was a missed opportunity, I think, to ask dozens of people ""What's the nicest thing anyone has done for you?"" and not follow up with how/whether they passed it along; whether it was in fact contagious. So those interviews, which take up half the screen time, didn't add anything to the (supposed) main point.",1475712000,,456,4.7125
8708492,3,B00UVCI3I8,A bit dry with a super message.,1454457600,,31,3.5714285714285716
8708493,2,B00UVCI3I8,"I was very excited about this and think kindness is a much-needed, under-discussed topic and hoped this would be substantial and even inspiring! This felt trite though and I quickly tired of what seemed like endless mini-interviews of 'what's the nicest thing anyone ever did for you?' They rehashed the pay-it-forward stuff, showed people giving out free hugs. I've actually unwrapped it, decided not to give it to my niece and nephews for Christmas(don't want their time wasted as mine was).  I turned it off before it was finished.  Guess I'm immune to this particular contagion, am just a big old meanie or something! Ha ha.  Really though, trying to save someone like me the time, cash and trouble.  It's definitely not for all who are interested in kindness as a subject.",1450915200,,777,4.863636363636363
8708494,5,B00UVCI3I8,Beautifully done documentary. It's heartfelt and inspiring without being preach-y. Really makes me hopeful about our society and the shifts in consciousness currently happening. Spread the kindness and help the idea of paying it forward go viral!,1445904000,,246,5.675675675675675
8708495,5,B00UVCI3I8,"Amazing documentary about how one act of kindness can multiply exponentially throughout society.  Heartwarming, inspirational, and amazing!  This movie is life-changing!",1438819200,,169,7.0
