1687849,5,B00006371P,Great first hand history. I enjoy listening to how people survived such slaughter and mayhem. So many lost their lives!,1371427200,,119,5.0
1687850,4,B00006371P,"This is a unique production, as it shows how the scenes were put together in conjunction with the finished scenes.  The battle scenes are realistic without attempting to match the spilling of blood and guts that occurred in the real events.",1361836800,,240,4.853658536585366
1687851,1,B00006371P,"Please refer to William Gilmore Simms book: The Sack and Siege of Columbia, SC to read about the carnage this officer and his men inflicted upon the innocent civilian population in their March to the Sea.  The crimes against humanity this army participated in makes the Nazi SS look tame in comparison.  I look forward to a historical film that documents this era from the southern civilians perspective.  I hope the writer of this film is simply ignorant of the events surrounding the Grand Army of the Republic and does not support the removal and extermination Sherman and his army inflicted upon the old men, women and children they encountered.  Vile, Vile, Vile...the character in this film is no hero.",1216080000,2,708,4.875
1687852,1,B00006371P,I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE........IT DEFINITELY IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A KEN BURNS DOCUMENTARY.  THE QUALITY IS POOR/VOLUMN CONTROL WAS VIRTUALLY NON EXISTANT.  FOUND MYSELF TURNING IT UP AND DOWN ALL THROUGH THE DVD.  BUSSLER'S UNFORM EVEN LOOKED PHONEY WITH HIS PLAID SHIRT ON UNDER IT.........JUST NOT A QUALITY PRODUCT ......... PERIOD!,1102291200,4,366,5.169491525423729
1687853,1,B00006371P,"As the daughter and sister of several Civil War reenactors, I have grown up learning as much as I can about the Civil War.  I am constantly searching for new books and films to increase my knowledge.  Although it seems that Oscar Jackson led an interesting life, the way it is conveyed in this ""film"" is for the most part boring, inconsistent and unprofessional.  Last year I helped my son (who is in High School) make a fictional Civil War movie for a state history competition...and I can honestly say, biases aside, that my son's project looked more professional and was more comprehensive than ""Left For Dead"".  It seems to me that this movie was filmed with an 8 millimeter home movie camera due to the graininess and bleeding colors.  The editing suggests that this is a martial arts movie rather than one about America's Civil War, with incessant blood, vomiting and unnecessary action.  On a positive note, the music playing throughout much of the movie is very authentic and enjoyable.  In addition, the map cartoons are very helpful, but still don't compensate for the unprofessional filming.",1037232000,16,1102,4.86096256684492
1687854,5,B00006371P,"Not being a Civil War ""buff,"" but someone who enjoys Civil War media, I found the film both entertaining and educational.  The compelling storyline and interesting cinematography captures the journey of a simple teacher turned soldier effectively and gives the viewer of a sense of not just his individual part in the war, but the journey of his unit and the role it played in the reunifaction of the country.  I recommend this film for all types of viewers.",1018915200,3,458,4.784810126582278
1687855,4,B00006371P,For all you civil war buffs this is a fine film. It's roughly an hour program in the same vein as any A&E type civil war re-enactment. This film follows the civil war experience of Colonel Oscar Jackson as based on his diary. The graphic depictions at times gives a feel for what it must have been like to be in the war.,1016582400,3,320,4.095238095238095
1687856,5,B00006371P,"Michael Kraus is at it again in this wonderful new piece based on the true story of ""The Colonel's Diary"".  This production covers the Civil War life of Oscar Jackson and his involvement with the 63rd Ohio.  The struggles and battles Jackson experiences are told through strong riveting reeanctments.  The attention to detail and bloody scenes place the viewer right on the battlefield while the story is backed by narration and pictures.  It is interesting and very informative documentary which certainly captures the gore, panic and horrors associated with combat in the Civil War.  Great camera angles and different approaches to filming is certainly a bonus for the viewer in this production. I would like to also note that the sound and quality of picture has improved from the Civil War Minutes production made by Kraus.  This DVD is must have for anyone following the Civil War especially those interested in learning about the western campaigns.  Three Cheers for Kraus and Company, ""Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!""",1016582400,6,1017,5.127272727272727
1687857,1,B00006371P,Was about the worst movie documentary that I've ever watched!,1462060800,,61,5.2
1687858,4,B00006371P,"Nice, amateur telling of a soldier's memoir.",1457568000,,44,5.428571428571429

1687860,3,B00006371P,Good detailed historical account of Ohio troops in the civil war..young officer in particular ....,1453593600,,98,5.6
1687861,5,B00006371P,"If you like history especially of the civil war this is a must. A horrible war for both sides with the south suffering the most with fewer men, supplies.",1444262400,,153,4.310344827586207
1687862,3,B00006371P,"As an amateur history buff, I'm constantly on the lookout for drama based on the subject.  It is pleasing to see accurate portrayals of the past, especially depictions of significance such as culture, social issues, or science.  An old saying states that anyone who has read three books on a given subject becomes an expert in that field.  That puts me in a leg-up category, so true depictions that would satisfy my critical tastes are extremely rare.  But having said that, this movie is well made and worth a viewing and the visual accuracies are given more than a casual nod.  True, it's not on the level of ""Red Badge..."" but it's a good try.",1438473600,2,646,4.582608695652174

1687876,4,B00006371P,"This is the true story. The part about being left for dead is a minor part of the story of a young man who goes off to battle as a recent officer and struggles valiantly through the war as an example to his men. The Civil War looms as our most tragic and costly war. Although this is a low-budget film, I thought the acting and recreations were quite effective.",1420156800,,361,4.171428571428572
1687877,5,B00006371P,One of those well put together movies with educational benefits as well,1414368000,,71,5.0

1687879,5,B00006371P,"Very well produced, written, edited photographed documentary acted out as drama with intensity, and factual array of visual and sound simulations of the Civil War.  Mr. Bussler is a totally committed historian whose productions have given me insights into the OVI of which my Great-Grandfather served.  This should be viewed by High School History classes to give a closer to truth account of some of the aspects of the fighting still affect us today!  I've been to many of the Southern Cities featured in this story and spent many hours in Resaca, GA which is now the site of a major stop along I-75 N. of Atlanta!",1396742400,,615,4.728971962616822
1687880,5,B00006371P,"Very well put together, informative, interesting, & enlightening!  It would be nice to have more documentaries like this of any other soldiers Civil War Life that is as well or near documented as this case is.  Thank you Michael Kraus!  Great work!",1392163200,,248,4.857142857142857
1687881,5,B00006371P,I really enjoyed the program. Living in N Al. I wasn't aware of the history of the area I'd passed through dozens of times. I'm definitely going to stop in Iuka and Corinth Ms. and learn a bit more about the history there.,1391299200,,222,4.186046511627907
1687882,5,B00006371P,I discovered facts about the war that I never knew. It was a very informative film.i would recommend this film to be viewed by civil war buffs.,1388275200,,143,4.333333333333333
1687883,4,B00006371P,"Since it comes up frequently in others reviews I will say that yes, the production level is not Ken Burns. That being said there aspects of this documentary that are more informative than Ken Burns. The point of view is from a soldier's perspective which adds to the larger narrative of the battle. The information about the battle is detailed, well researched and nicely thought through. There is a lot of good factual information and overall I think it is a good effort that is worth the time for people interested in the Civil War.",1388188800,,534,4.631578947368421
1687884,1,B00006371P,IT was not worth a crap because all they did was sit and talk. No action  or  involvement or solutions.,1372982400,,103,4.1
