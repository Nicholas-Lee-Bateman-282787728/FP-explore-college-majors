2896522,5,B000TEUSM2,"This show is great, light-hearted and fun.  The Southern charm is a refreshing take on comedy and you definitely don't have to be Southern to enjoy the twang-y humor (although having any Southern connection adds to the appeal).  I have shared this with many of my friends and family and it is always time well spent.",1196121600,,316,4.625
2896523,5,B000TEUSM2,"The ""Southern Fried Chicks"" are four women who do stand-up comedy. I caught their hour special on CMT (this video contains that material and MORE) and have to say I've never laughed out loud so much at a show like this. The stand-up routine performances were definitely 'each their own' and these gals really do a phenomenal job. They get a little raunchy, but nothing too over the top/obnoxious. For a good hour of just plain ol' contemporary country comedy, this DVD fills the order. Be prepared to laugh out loud, and often. Both my husband and I found the Southern Fried Chicks to be marvelously funny.",1194048000,3,606,4.672897196261682
2896549,5,B000TEUSM2,I could watch this dvd over and over. It is really funny!! I've never seen Etta Mae perform before this dvd came out. It's definately worth watching if you want a good laugh.,1357689600,,174,4.303030303030303
2896550,4,B000TEUSM2,"This is a great video! Each Southern Chick is hilarious in her own right. With their wonderful stories, these ladies portray a picture of the South that isn't too far out there(I'm a Southerner so I know) and is simply hilarious. I initially decided to watch this video to Trish Suhr who I know from 'Clean House,' but in the end, I found a video that I can watch over and over again, and I've become a new fan of some great, talented, SOUTHERN female comics.",1308355200,,459,4.348837209302325
2896551,5,B000TEUSM2,this cd was tremendously funny and made my day I bought two more and sent them to my mom and mom in law for Christmas!,1260230400,,118,3.76
2896552,5,B000TEUSM2,"This video is hysterical! Etta May, Beth Donahue, Trish Suhr and Sonya White all do a superb job with their monologues. Their ""Down Home"" flavor adds the right touch to keep you laughing! Give it a try. Larry Poole",1258675200,,214,4.512820512820513
2896553,5,B000TEUSM2,The video was hilarious. I hope they do a tour like the blue comedy tour again.,1247270400,,79,4.0

2896555,5,B000TEUSM2,I bought this DVD after seeing Southern Fried Chicks on Comedy central. I laughed so hard I cried. I'm a southern chick myself and had to own this DVD after watching it. I also bought one for my mom as a gift and she really loved it. I would definitely recommend this product.,1231372800,2,276,4.226415094339623
2896556,4,B000TEUSM2,"If you like the MEN of ""Blue Comedy Tour"" then you'll love this.  These women will make you laugh so hard.  The first comedian is pretty stupid, so I forwarded it past her.  The second lady is pretty good.  But then the blonde who does the impressions is so talented!  Her comdey is original.  And you have to hear the last one, Etta May, talk about her family.  You will want to watch it over and over again.",1230076800,3,409,4.166666666666667
2896557,5,B000TEUSM2,"This was absolutely one of the funniest comedy shows I have ever seen.  Don't forget to watch the deleted scene.  I can't believe that this was the deleted screen.  It is especially for the women.  If you love comedy, you will not be disappointed with this DVD.",1204502400,2,261,4.48936170212766
2896558,4,B000TEUSM2,"Hilarious performances from all of these semi-Southern women, but this is NOT family material!

DON'T include Grandma or the kids when viewing this, as you're all likely to blush during certain portions!

A great hour of hilarity for the grown-ups!",1199491200,2,248,5.175

8208715,3,B000TEUSM2,"Enjoyed 2 of the 4 Southern fried chicks. Clean, funny comedy, but not something I would listen to again. That's why it was just ok with me.",1386460800,,140,4.222222222222222

8208717,1,B000TEUSM2,"I have not seen the dvd, I didn't  know that I ordered it wrong, and therefore I never got to view the dvd.  I was trying to buy a copy and have it to play on a borrowed dvd player.  How do I correct my order??? I  tried but could not figure it out.  Please credit my account or send me a copy of the dvd.",1367452800,,305,3.5606060606060606
8208718,5,B000TEUSM2,THIS IS BY FAR THE FUNNIEST COMEDY DVD I HAVE EVER SEEN. It is even better than Jeff Foxworthy and Ron White's comedy tours. You may actually wet your pants while laughing so hard! Highly recommended,1366761600,,199,4.555555555555555
