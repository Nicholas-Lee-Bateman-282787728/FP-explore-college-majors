8272241,4,B00197POX6,George could cut back on his narratives a little - sometimes the narration gets a little annoying.  Otherwise enjoyable.,1486252800,,120,5.315789473684211
8272242,3,B00197POX6,"Frankly, I was disappointed in this.  There was too much hype and loud blaring electric guitar noise! I was looking forward to something more factual and peaceful, with the beauty of Alaska featured as well.",1480636800,,207,4.914285714285715
8272243,5,B00197POX6,"Geo Beach does an excellent job of showing tenderfoots like me a side of Alaska that most of us never see when we take a cruise ship or pampered vacation to Alaska. Being a native of Homer, and having lived there for a good portion of his life, Geo is not afraid to tackle these hazardous occupations himself. This is not your typical wildlife video. This is a glimpse into the lives of hard-working Alaskans, who risk their lives every day to put food on the table for their families. Great series. I was hoping for a season two. Try it...you won't be disappointed.",1327881600,3,566,4.451923076923077
8272244,5,B00197POX6,It is fun watching this series.  I think it helped spawn the ideas for many of the current crop of Alaska reality shows.,1325894400,2,120,4.217391304347826
8272245,5,B00197POX6,The product was in perfect condition and came in a timely manner!!  13 hours of Geo Beach!  What a surprise that the 4 DVD's came in a metal case!  This is a series that is so interesting and informative about the different careers in Alaska.  We watch these over and over again!  Love it..,1321660800,2,290,4.296296296296297
8272246,5,B00197POX6,"This 4-disk set covers a wide variety of outdoor jobs and industries complicated by the harsh Alaskan weather. The thirteen episodes are Gold Mining, Salmon Fishing, Electric Linemen, Logging, Railroading, Deadly Winter, Dangerous Earth, Dangerous Roads, Extreme Salvaging, Wild Waste, Arctic Troopers, Frozen Freeway, and Extreme Isolation. There's also a bonus feature with additional scenes and information. I found this series to be very interesting and informative. Most people probably don't realize just how harsh conditions are in Alaska, and how it complicates and even threatens everyday life. This set is good for all ages, and worth watching more than once.",1306281600,8,669,5.633663366336633
8272247,5,B00197POX6,"This is the most authentic portrayal of Alaska I've seen.  I lived in that state many years myself and have been in some of the places the host features.  He jumps right into every situation no matter how new to him or physically uncomfortable with a hearty but respectful attitude.  He and the show try to use the correct pronunciation for Alaskan place names.  It's quite wonderfully done, and I highly recommend renting or purchasing this dvd.",1277510400,8,446,4.753246753246753
8272248,5,B00197POX6,"Well, I bought this because a friend of mine was in it. Though I noticed I know a lot of people in the different episodes. So it was a good purchase for me to give as a gift.",1242345600,3,174,3.6052631578947367
8272249,5,B00197POX6,"I watched this series on TV and Geo Beach gives great insight into life in the coldest, largest state in the Union from a working man's perspective.  Great show if you were ever curious about what Alaska's really like.",1236384000,6,218,4.589743589743589
8272250,5,B00197POX6,This is an awesome dvd. It came in a very timely manner. I am very pleased with this purchase,1235088000,5,93,3.9473684210526314
