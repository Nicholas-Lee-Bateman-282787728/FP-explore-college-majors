8482636,1,B005PR6TXA,"I am sorry to say I did not like this DVD set, The price is way too high for six 30 minute episodes and on top of that, the discs freeze up. I only saw the first few minutes of the first disc and that was it. The 2nd disc freeze frames like a strobe light. I tried multiple players to make sure the problem was with the discs and had the same outcome every time.
I hate leaving a negative responce but it is only one opinion and someone else may feel different.
