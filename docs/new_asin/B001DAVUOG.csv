I feel absolutely blown away by Megumi's parents. They are unbelievable examples to this world of love, passion and committment. Wow. I hope and pray to God that they have peace. They deserve nothing less than that.",1463875200,,268,5.068181818181818
8292499,5,B001DAVUOG,Very moving story. Shipped quickly. Highly recommended.,1416960000,,55,7.0
8292500,3,B001DAVUOG,It was good but was not narrated well.  There should have been more to the reasons why they were kidnapped and the ones that came back should have been interviewed for more detail of their ordeal.,1395619200,,196,4.444444444444445
8292501,5,B001DAVUOG,"I read , by Sakie Yokota, Megumi's mother. It was heart-wrenching and eye-opening. I watched this immediately afterwards, and it served to compliment the book well. It has a nice summary of all of the relevant events, including political moves by North Korea, Japan, and the US, and other abductions.",1385683200,,300,5.02
8292502,5,B001DAVUOG,I can only echo what other reviewers have said about Abduction: The Megumi Yokota Story. Abduction is a great documentary than not only informs but moves. I first saw it on PBS and was horrified by the abduction of Yokota Megumi and moved by the struggle of Yokota Megumi's parents and the parents of other abducted in the face of a government that didn't initially seem to care and a populace that sometimes seemed like it didn't want to know about what happened to many Japanese citizens. Abduction is an incredibly moving and emotionally draining documentary and I am glad that I can thank the filmmakers here for bringing the story of Yokota Megumi and other abductees to my attention. Thank you.,1318982400,4,700,4.745901639344262
8292503,5,B001DAVUOG,"This is a well balanced, carefully made, and honest documentary.  You will see an overview of the difficult issue.  It is a heart-breaking experience.",1238716800,3,150,5.208333333333333
