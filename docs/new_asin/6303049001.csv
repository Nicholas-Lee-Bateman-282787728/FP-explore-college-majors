540124,4,6303049001,"Everyone in this film gives a top performance, even the usually over-acting De Carlo; Gable is almost doing a reprise of his magnificent Rhett Butler role as the powerful and mysterious landowner. Thatcher is  great as the rollicking sea captain and Knowles is properly hateful as the  smug, bigoted and pompous plantation owner who lusts after De Carlo. The  direction is by the legendary Raoul Walsh in this fine adaptation of the  novel by Robert Penn Warren. Max Steiner's score is at once thundering and  plaintive.",947116800,9,520,5.0

540244,3,6303049001,Gone With the Wind Par II. But not a Gone With the Wind. Entertaining. Good story. Fairly well told. Too much story to put into a movie. Would have been a good mini-series to allow for character development.,1496275200,,207,4.473684210526316

540246,4,6303049001,"I enjoyed this film, and ended up buying it on Amazon Instant Video.  It's an interesting exploration of race relations in the Old South.  However, I still can't give it five stars because there is enough Uncle Tom-ism in the film that it dilutes what the message is supposed to be.  The message is supposed to be that, in the end, race doesn't matter and bad pasts can be forgiven.  However, the way in which Amantha resolves her conflict is almost too quick and too facile.  Also, as another reviewer of the film stated, Yvonne de Carlo is not believable as a mulatto woman.  Much of her role in this film is confined to being the damsel in distress.  The character of Hamish Bond, Clark Gable's character, is full of contradictions.  He's not really an advocate of abolitionism at all.  He is a man who has given in to being a slave owner largely out of cynicism. He sees little difference between the way slaves are treated versus the way they will be treated under the martial law of Reconstruction. The movie again dilutes the message about race not being the most important thing about human beings, by the fact that Hamish is a ""kind"" slave owner; we get the idea that the film's message is that slavery is ""okay"" as long as the slaves are treated well.  The only way in which this morass of moral dilly-dallying becomes clearer is through the message of Rau-ru, Sydney Poitier's character, who repeats that this kindness enslaves him and his fellow slaves all the more because it takes away their outrage over not being free men.  It's a film with mixed and convoluted concepts.  But I still enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the costumes, the scenery, and the way in which the film highlighted how differently Amantha was treated by white people once they found out that she wasn't really completely white.  I have to say that I'm thankful for the time we live in now, where things like that truly don't matter and nobody even thinks twice about mixed marriages between people of varying skin hues.",1488758400,,1997,4.604519774011299

I am prone to do that in regard to handsome men in the movies. The story intrigued me and being from the south with elderly relatives who told Civil War stories, I found the movie to be quite interesting. Yvonne deCarlo was beautiful and played her part so well. Clark Gable was - well he was Clark Gable and that's enough said about that. Sidney Poitier was wonderful, too. This was one time that I really did like the movie better than the book. The ending was so much better. The bedroom scene with the storm blowing in through the glass doors stays fresh in my mind.

540645,4,6303049001,"Among Gable's last ""leading man roles"", over a decade after GWTW. It depicts civil war era New Orleans and environs, like GWTW depicts Atlanta, in a highly stereotypical manner. Those stereotypes evoke modern embarrassment at the portrayal of relationships among social and racial groups. Still, as offensive as some of the depictions are, the story of interracial affairs and love is a bold one for the early 50's. It is a rarely shown film, but one that delivers a powerful, entertaining and surprisingly emotionally evocative story, well played by Gable, Yvonne DeCarlo and a young and angry Sidney Poitier.",1424390400,3,610,5.171717171717172

540878,5,6303049001,"This is one of those rare movie gems that many have never even heard of. It grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go.

It is a captivating story about a young southern belle who was raised on a plantation in KY with everything that a young girl of privilege could ask for. Her father completely adores and dotes on her and she has known nothing but a life of ease that is until the death of her father. That is when everything that Amantha has ever known becomes unraveled and she is pitched headlong into a nightmare. It is cruely and heartlessly revealed that Amantha's mother was in fact a slave and although she looks white she is half black. Her father was deeply engrossed in debt unbeknownst to Amantha and most of his assets are having to be sold to pay his debts. And because of her mixed blood she too is seen as part of his ""property"" and is to be sold like all of the other slaves that he owned.

She is forcefully removed from her home and sent to New Orleans where she is put up on the auction block like any other common slave. Amantha's being a very beautiful young woman and being able to pass for white means that she is a much sought after prize for whomever wins the bid for her. When the lears and calls for all of the ""merchandise"" to be shown so that they can know what they are bidding on begins Amantha is horrified and completely shamed. Enter Hamish Bond who quickly starts the bidding and outbids everyone else paying an amazingly exorbient price for her. When he takes her to his home naturally Amantha expects the worst. What she finds is a man haunted by his own past who doesn't try to force himself on her and showers her with kindnesses that most would never even think of giving a slave. However nice Hamish appears to be he still bought and paid for her and Amantha doesn't know if she can ever get past that no matter how handsome and generous a master he is he is still just that...her master.

The Civil War soon breaks out and things get more difficult for both Hamish and Amantha. Also Hamish's past could be an insurmountable obstacle for their fledgling love.

Are these two lost souls destended to be together or will the Civil War claim them both as it has countless others.

Both Clark Gable and Yvonne De Carlo are wonderful in this film. Their chemistry leaps off the screen and you can't help but root for them. Sidney Poitier also appears as Rau-Ru another of Hamish's slaves who though Hamish has lavished on him and treated him more like a son that a slave Rau-Ru still harbors a deep resentment and even hatred for him as his master.

It truly is a diamond in the rough and one not to be missed if you enjoy period movies with romance and a touch of action thrown in for good measure",1403913600,,2743,4.326848249027237
540879,5,6303049001,"Clark Gable and Yvonne DeCarlo at their best.
It's a story that takes place in New Orleans during the slave days.
It gives you a glimpse of the terrible things that happened during that era.",1403740800,,190,4.457142857142857
540880,3,6303049001,"This movie is high camp.  In short, it's so bad it's good.  I laughed throughout for all the wrong reasons.  It is sure to offend people because the depictions of slavery, race relations, and women in general are damningly offensive.  Though it clearly intends to espouse the wrongs of slavery, it still manages to be totally racist. When I learned that the director Raoul Walsh was one of D.W. Griffith's assistant directors on ""Birth of the Nation"" this didn't come as much of a surprise.

The story is based on a novel by Robert Penn Warren. Amantha Star (played by Yvonne de Carlo as Warner Brother's 1957 answer to Scarett O'Hara) is brought up with comfort and luxury in the breast of her father's Kentucky plantation.  Sent off to finishing school, she is suddenly summoned home to arrive at the very moment they are lowering her father's coffin into the ground.  He was of course a very kindly master to all of his slaves. Manty (as she is called) strives to emulate his behavior. Upon hearing that her father has been left penniless as men conspire to sell the slaves from his estate to cover debts she balks at such cruelty, but that turns out to be the least of her problems. It is then revealed that she is in fact the daughter of a slave herself and therefore her father's property, and before she knows it, she's on the auction block too.

Fortunately for her, Rhett Butler AKA Clark Gable buys her (though he's called Hamish Bond here). Basically she is purchased as a sex slave, but  while all other red blooded men she encounters merely want to rape Amantha, for some reason Hamish doesn't want to, so she falls in love with him. He eventually offers her freedom but she opts to stay with him as his chattel, provided she can pass for a white woman on the down low. This in and of itself is problematic for obvious reasons, as she rejects independence to remain in bondage. But the war comes along and Hamish's angry slave  and adopted heir (the amazing Sidney Poitier, early in his career) has grown up into a revolutionary, and he turns against his father/master and joins the evil Yankees who want to arrest Hamish.  But everything works out for Hamish/Rhett in the end, and he's able to go off and start a new life with Amantha, who embraces white privilege with open arms as they take off together in search of their own warped happily ever after.

I can't even begin to discuss all of the problems presented in this movie which are played out with flourish and lurid detail, but I'll start with the hallelujah slave chorus who show up on the banks of the river singing spiritual ""amens"" every time their master is in view.  Then there is Hamish, the ""good"" Louisiana master who we learn was also at the helm of a slave trading operation at one point in his life. He comes to realize that slavery is wrong, but treats his gory and violent slave trading past as if it were merely a little phase he went through like a high school kid who goes Goth for a few years. Probably most alarming of all is Amantha Star herself, (known to me as Lillian Munster from ""the Munsters"") who is placed in a no win situation as the tragic mulatto.  She is damned from the beginning; brought up as white, but subsequently expected to embrace being Black once she's put on the market to be sold.  She is never made to co-habitate with the other slaves, distinctly set apart from them by virtue of her light complexion, which also makes her a prime sexual target.  Regardless of her superior status from the lowly field hands she is still a ""negress"" and therefore subjected to certain abuse for life as she can never wholly overcome the shame that her Black blood represents. Still, Amantha fortunately lucks out by getting a really nice master so she can shack up with him as his high end mistress (even though he looks like her grandfather), and thus buried beneath satin and furbelows, enjoys a pretty good life for a slave girl. Why would she ever want freedom when it is offered? She insists on passing as a white woman once she has settled in with Rhett and is criticized for that, Sidney Poitier knocks her upside the head for forsaking her people, but she could care less about them. There are pronounced overtones of self loathing throughout and she may be one of the most racist characters in the movie.  The fact that she falls in love with her master, and eschews freedom in order to stay with him is hard to digest. Though ""Band of Angels"" intends to emphasize that slavery is wrong, as long as slaves were well treated and singing praises to their master, it wasn't necessarily that bad, whereas all Yankees are despicable hypocrites. This is spelled out when Amantha's first beau from finishing school (an abolitionist clergyman no less) shows up and ravages her after he finds out about her  mixed race heritage, and thus is added to her vast collection of would be rapists.

The acting is entertaining either because of or in spite of the most insanely contrived dialogue ever written. It's typical 1950s technicolor, and much of it may be likened to a very weird, unseemly sequel to ""Gone With the Wind.""  Rhett is looking pretty old and worse for wear, Yvonne de Carlo is lovely before she embraced Lily Munster as her signature role, but she is not much more than a poor man's Vivien Leigh. Sidney Portier is fabulous and dignified, and I give all of these actors all the credit in the world for soldiering through with this project. Apparently Clark Gable deemed it to be the worst film he ever made. And again, it is unquestionably terrible. But I found it delightful to watch all the same, if only for its schlock value, which it serves up like a juicy watermelon on a hot summer day.

It's difficult to read some of these reviews who praise this movie and cite it as a good example of what slavery and race relations were like in the old South and during the Civil War. This movie is merely a glossy, technicolor soap opera that has nothing to do with actual history on any level.  The reason I liked it is because it's hysterical NOT historical. The script is so bad it's hard to believe that the actors were able to deliver their lines with straight faces, and the entire premise of is so fantastical that it borders on being shockingly surreal.  That is the only reason to watch it, and it should not be watched alone as the content is too insane to absorb by one's self.  I actually couldn't believe what I was seeing, it was so completely off its rocker.  By the end I had to pick my jaw up off the floor, but I also couldn't suppress my laughter. However, most people will fail to see the humor in it, and if that's the case, should avoid it like the plague.  But if you think at any point that this is an accurate, historical drama you may be in trouble, and I advise you to waste no time to march over to your local continuing education center to take an American History course. It's about as historically accurate as the ""Birth of the Nation"" except it is slightly less offensive, and infinitely more palpable.  Watch it with some friends and a pitcher of mint juleps.

Y'vonne DeCarlo is Amantha a wealthy Planter's daughter who discovers her mother was part-negro, thereby demoting her socially from belle to slave--has little to do but try to act teen-aged and run away to her room.  She lacks the needed softness for a the part.  In this ill-advised attempt to re-incarnate the cool depth and suave complexity of Rhett Butler, Gable is cast as the one-dimensional Hamish Bond, who buys Amantha at an auction to save her from a worse fate as a supposedly white ""negress"".  Hamish inexplicably feels guilty about his past as a slave-trader, even though he has several plantations and even more slaves, who also inexplicably gather and sing reverently along the river banks whenever he appears on his plantation (can't believe they went there!).  Even though Hamish is a rich, handsome and eligible Southern Gentleman he seems to find it necessary to buy and seduce young Amantha.  Sidney Portier is Bond's slave, and despite having been raised by Hamish with all the privileges of a son, resents Hamish and longs to be free--that part is understandable.

541037,3,6303049001,"An unusual 1957 melodrama with a fairly good cast, the script for this is not free of a few groaners and a few characterizations that call for endurance. The viewers' introduction to Gable's character, for one, is of a US bully from the ""we-saved-the-world"" 1950s. Also, a very cliche'd sailor friend's drinking scene at Gable's mansion was teeth-grinding for this viewer, to say nothing of the fawning slaves who gather to sing their Mass'ahs praises.

That now out of the way, there's more at work that to my mind saves this movie. Supported by Sidney Poitier and Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Clark Gable and Yvonne deCarlo play the lead pair, who openly ""live in sin"" and are otherwise reprehensible -- yet both are also portrayed sympathetically. Set in the 'Gone with the Wind' period, Gable plays an ex-slaver and cotton-grower who once prowled his plantation's slave shacks for his jollies. She is the shameful issue of a liaison with a slave on another plantation, and it's even suggested that she fools around on Gable while he's away on business.

This movie's clearly no gem, but it's no dreck either (probably the main reason for my writing it is to correct some overstated disdain about it). However maudlin and overdone, its basic theme of the redemptive power of love is fairly well handled. The era and settings are unusual and atmospheric enough to hold interest, and the plot's entanglements only seldom strain credulity.

This may well have been Yvonne De Carlo's highest profile film, and Gable does a fair job with an okay script from the era when the studios were struggling to survive. Sidney Poitier has a small but meaty role as an educated slave with a deep grudge. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. got his first speaking part in this film, and acquits himself smoothly with limited material. Max Steiner grinds out a spotty soundtrack that's effective in the chase scenes, though only just ...yet he never was a Miklos Rozsa or Bernard Herrmann.

The Warnercolour's glorious, and the art direction is especially fine, with atmospheric scenes especially in the Gable character's New Orleans pied-a-terre and (less so) in his plantation mansion. Mind you, it's all 100% 1950s Hollywood, and very pristine and polished ...but let's not expect too much from an era when Edith Head primped up the women, and onscreen grime, sweat or facial stubble were as far off as the spaghetti westerns of the '60s -- or the cowboy noir, '3:10 to Yuma,' also from '57 ...come to think of it!

'Fairly good studio film for the 50s, in short: its eventful, sometimes quirky plot, more than passable acting and some unusual settings render it quite watchable.

541107,5,6303049001,"Band of Angels is a movie with a central theme comparable to a historical novel based on fact.
Clark Gable's role as Hamish Bond is a two-fold character with a very valid message of what
was in error during the Civil War both with the Confederacy and the Union.  The Confederacy
was condemned for its enslavement of Negros and Indentured servitude of poor whites.  The
Union did not have an unblemished record because it exploited Negro labor, and carpet-bagged
the South into poverty which really saw no relief until World War I and World War II.  This includes
a prison system which exploited labor of prisoners for ill-gotten gain, with some remnants which
remain in existence today.  During the150th Anniversary of the Civil War which is supposedly
celebrated, I contend it should be a time of solemn regret over Americans killing Americans.
 I had ancestors who fought on both sides,and branches of my family tree died because the men
were killed and whole household wiped out by disease.  A DVD movie like Band of Angels can
cause all of us to take the time to walk the battlefields - both North and South - to resolve never again -
regardless of race, creed or gender - Americans shall not kill Americans again.  Band of Angels is
worth both your time and purchase.  I was a decorated officer (Major) in the USAF and have a M.A.
in Political Science - sometimes a movie like Band of Angels with a basis of a historical novel, can
present the plain truth which the viewer can understand and appreciate instead of a documentary.",1374451200,6,1533,4.672862453531598

The so-believable plot is chock-full of twists, secrets, and surprises all along the way; I really enjoyed the plot's uniqueness - that it reminds me of no other movie!  Amantha and Hamish's life secrets are so anti-thetical that their relationship is the least-likely to succeed; and yet, the chemistry develops deeply despite the competition of younger, handsome suitors.  2 of the suitors are full aware of her past (as the daughter of a plantation owner and one of his black slave women), yet both treat her so differently.  Gable's acting is un-stereotypical, well-seasoned and so peaked.  Some reviewers seem to want Rhett back in this movie; but being forward, feisty and predictable isn't suitable for the mysterious, tormented, mature gentleman Gable portrays so perfectly in this movie.  The black acapella choruses are pure ear-candy, and likewise the costuming and plantation setting are ""woo-hoo"" eye-candy!

541246,4,6303049001,"I watched Band of Angels by chance on a cable station that features old movies. When the movie began I expected the usual racism of happy slaves and general ridiculousness but was intrigued by the description of 'a tale of miscegenation in the old South'. At some points in the movie I got exactly what I was expecting but every time I was going to change the channel the movie surprised me with something deeper and better and more interesting. I read the reviews on this site and decided that this movie was neither completely politically correct nor completely racist but reflected the simmering tensions and guilts and hopes of its time, written in 1955 and made in 1957 and reflecting all of the hope and despair of the period just before the civil rights movement.

Amantha Star has been raised as a Southern belle on her father's plantation where he treats his slaves kindly. She doesn't realize that she is the daughter of a mulatto slave and gets a nasty surprise at his funeral as her father never bothered with her manumission. And he is in debt so she and the population of the entire household are sold South. As well as being owned, rape is a constant danger to Amantha and the movie is more frank about the sexual problems of a slave woman than one would expect of a 1957 production. Nor are the other slaves very nice to Amantha or each other at all times which I thought was a realistic touch. Amantha is bought by Haimish Bond, a former slave trader now plantation owner whose former occupation is a secret and who tries to expiate his guilt by being kind to his slaves.

Next there is Ra Rou, played by a very young Sidney Poitier and it is Poitier's scenes which raise this movie above the usual offerings of the time. Ra Rou has been raised as a son to Haimish and in a very powerful scene tells Amantha just why the kindness makes being owned even worse as where can one direct their hatred for being an object when the one imprisoning you is also the one who loves you. Poitier's character, more than any other character reflects the changes that are coming in the time the movie is made rather than the time the movie reflects.

All in all, this was better than I expected though the movie does still refect the racism of its time, the Jim Crow south and the nascent civil rights movement. But it reflects some other things too - people's guilt yes, but also people's hope to do better. Mixed yes, but when in life are the good and the bad not mixed? Feminism is a problem as well in this film as it seems perfectly natural for the heroine to seek the protection of some man, even when she is offered her freedom and the possibility of taking care of herself. And the manner in which the rape of slave women is addressed is mixed. Ra Rou is Haimish's natural son as it turns out, but whether his mother was willing, or indeed whether Amantha's was entirely willing (and can a person who is owned even give consent?) is left to the viewer's questioning.

Clark Gable is as handsome and charming as ever and I remember why I fell in love with him upon a first viewing of GWTW when I was six. Sidney Poitier gives an impassioned performance that lifts the entire production and Yvonne deCarlo is lovely and competent. This movie is well worth watching for the things it does say and the things it doesn't and reflects the tensions of the late fifties with precision.",1347926400,,3387,4.449275362318841

First of all, it is hilariously melodramatic to the point of camp comedy and the performances by everyone in the film are laughable.  Yvonne De Carlo is pretty yet obviously thinks that she is in a soap opera, and Clark Gable could never get the monologue right and walks around like a stiff breeze the entire film.  Sidney Poitier's character is a mess, but his performance is just as choppy, which is a shame since he also starred in `Edge of the City' this very year and delivered one of his finest screen performances.

Strange.

The concept of a white woman shielded from the fact that she is half black and then being ripped from her life and sold into slavery when her father dies is kind of bizarre and yet acceptable in the world of moviedom, but it never really translates well and the relationship that is born from Amantha Starr and her `master' Hamish Bond is unbelievable and kind of creepy to be honest.

What I will say is that the color and quality of the film are fantastic compared to my vhs copy. The sets are superb as only old Hollywood could do. Authentic footage of the south.

 Yvonne DeCarlo is good, you see why she is cast here as they needed an actress with a look that would be believable going along with the story line.

541512,4,6303049001,"At last, available on DVD! We have quite a range of reactions to this film, from the greatest film ever to the worst film ever seen. I like to see it every now and then. In fact, I prefer it to the more polished ""Gone with the Wind"". Yes, Clark Gable is no longer the swaggering brawler, man of action and lady killer of the '30s. Here, we have a more mature and weathered Gable who has settled down to the genteel life of a southern plantation owner, after a financially successful life as a rough and tumble Yankee slave trader. Yet, he is still something of a rebel. He has a guilty conscience about his former life as a ruthless slave trader and wants to make partial amends by treating his large group of slaves decently. In fact, he plans to leave his estate to one. He tends to see the born southern aristocracy as decadently effete, as exemplified by his neighbor, who takes a liking to his recent light-skinned mulatto acquisition(Yvonne de Carlo,as Amantha). Clearly, Gable, as Hamish Bond, has no interest in supporting the recent unsettling changes on the political scene and impending Civil War. He recognizes that these events will probably end his idyllic life and that the lives of most of his slaves will likely be changed for the worse if they are liberated by Yankee troops. Perhaps he recognized that secession failed to solve the looming problem of a lack of new territories for the expansion of plantation slavery, thus depressing the value of young surplus slaves. Perhaps he also recognized that a separate South impeded the legal demands slave owners could make in recapturing slaves who escaped the Confederacy. On the other hand, Hamish refuses to support the cause of the Yankee troops who want to sell his soon-to-be harvested cotton. He risks execution in burning his crop and much of his equipment.
  Hamish rescues, in dramatic fashion, a beautiful cultivated mulatto(Yvonne de Carlo, as Amantha) from a fate she could not bear, although she initially shows no gratitude. He doesn't require than she become his mistress and in fact gives her a chance to escape his world, but she has a last minute change of heart and remains with him. Amantha has experienced two benevolent slave owners: her father and Hamish. This is in marked contrast to her treatment as a slave on the auction block. The dialogue makes it clear that Hamish and her father were rather exceptional in this regard. Thus, I don't buy the criticism that this film provides an unrealistically rosy picture of the typical lives of slaves. The film makes the viewer feel deeply the horror of a sudden change in status from a southern belle to a life-long slave. If you want a much more extreme example, read the book ""Skeletons in the Zaraha"", in which  shipwrecked Yankee sailors are transformed into barely living slaves of fearsome tribes or Arabs near the coast of northwest Africa.
  The relationship between Hamish and his slave and appointed successor Rau-Ru(Sidney Poitier) is another key element of this story. Rau-Ru hates the institution of slavery and Hamish even more for his rather successful attempt to make slavery agreeable to his slaves. The fact that Hamish has willed him as his successor does not change Rau-Ru's attitude. The last portion of the film deals mainly with the back and forth relationships between Rau-Ru, as a now Union soldier, and Hamish and between Amantha and Hamish and a certain Caucasian Union soldier. See the film to find out how this rapidly changing complex of relationships turns out.",1200009600,5,3527,4.823140495867769

The sole extras of the DVD are a dubbed version in French language and a theatrical trailer. The quality of the images is near perfect and the sound pays tribute to a wonderful musical score composed by Max Steiner.

BAND OF ANGELS, - I personally consider its racial implications as peripheral -, is a study of human reactions in front of a crisis. The main characters of the film will then all react in the same manner : by taking flight. Amantha Starr's attempts to run away constitute a sizeable part of the film, Hamish Bond, who doesn't manage to forget his heavy past, will not wait for the Confederate army to be hanged like his neighbors and Rau-Ru experiences the behavior pattern of a man who runs away from his conscience.

Some will say that BAND OF ANGELS is slow and that the characters talk too much instead of acting. Maybe, maybe not. The best scenes of the films are not particularly bustling. Just think about the discussion in the garden between Hamish Bond and his old navy pal that starts in the peace of a southern night and ends up in a violent storm or about the scene of the duel between Hamish Bond and his neighbor Charles de Marigny. This scene is a pure jewel of suspense and reminds us that Raoul Walsh was a great director.

The negative reviewer obviously did not see this movie, because:

The Clark Gable character was not a rapist.

On the contrary, if anything, the Sidney Poitier character said Hamish Bond killed with kindness.

The woman house servant had only good things to say about Bond.

Amantha Starr did not fall in love with a rapist.

Hamish Bond's revelations at the end may have been melodramatic, drums beating in the background, but the pathetic truth is, the slave trade had its advocates in both races and both continents.

And life under the Carpetbagger occupation had certain hazards, especially for women.

For an interesting twist on the subject, read _River Rising_ by Athol Dickson, set in Louisiana bayous in 1927.

Also, _A Country Such as This_ the re-released excellent novel and social commentary by James Webb, former Secretary of the Navy.",1154044800,28,954,5.103225806451613
541647,2,6303049001,"""Band of Angels""

1957

Directed by Raoul Walsh

Starring Clark Gable, Yvonne DeCarlo, Sidney Poitier, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Carolle Drake

Warning! This review contains spoilers! The end of the movie will be revealed!

Plot: a light-skinned daughter of a plantation owner and a slave is sold into slavery after living a young life of luxury. A series of men attempt to rape and/or seduce her. Finally, she embarks on her ""happily ever after"" with a slave trader.

Where to begin. How to summarize everything that is wrong with this ugly little movie.

It must be said that this film has its fans. One can see why.

""Band of Angels"" has star power: Gable, who did not age well, is 56 here, and he looks ten years older, but he's still Gable. This is your one chance to see Sidney Poitier and Gable together. Yvonne DeCarlo is a great beauty.

The film has glorious sets of the old South, lovely gowns, and a series of bodice-ripper scenes that some will find arousing.

It has a tried and true bodice-ripper, romance novel plot: a woman falls in love with her rapist, and in this case, her owner: a slave trader who bought her at a slave auction.

Many viewers will find this plot, though, icky, and Gable is too creaky here to ignite the kind of spark he could once ignite that will get us past the ick factor.

The real problem with this movie is this: the movie thinks that it is a groundbreaking, truth-telling, realistic depiction of the horrors of the enslavement of African Americans. It's not, though. Rather, it is a tragic display of white denial.

I know what you're thinking. ""This reviewer is politically correct!"" The thing is, I'm not politically correct at all. ""Gone with the Wind"" is one of my favorite movies.

But ""Gone with the Wind"" has tremendous narrative and archetypal power that transcends its unrealistic portrayal of slavery.

""Band of Angels"" has no such power.

Its ""realistic"" and ""truth telling"" depiction of slavery includes the following:

In the opening scene, two slaves are shown running away. They, like the other slaves in the movie, are very well dressed. Even GWTW has the decency to show slaves in ragged clothing.

Read descriptions of how real slaves actually dressed. They dressed in rags, or in nothing at all.

The runaways walk tall and quick. Their body movements announce that they consider themselves to be the equal of their captors.

Again, even GWTW depicted the deferential walk and posture that slaves had to adopt. Read Richard Wright. Blacks in the South had to assume a different posture and walk just to survive, right up until the Civil Rights Movement.

The runaway slaves' owner decides to punish them -- by having them pull weeds!  Read any honest history of slavery. Runaway slaves were punished with horrible tortures. ""Pulling weeds"" was not one of them.

There is one bad white Southerner in the movie. Like most of the other men in the movie, he tries to rape Yvonne DeCarlo. She easily rebuffs him. Millions of real slaves were not so lucky.

Most of the white Southerners in the movie are well meaning, and most of the slaves are happy. Carolle Drake, whose dignified performance is the best thing about the movie -- it is a real tragedy that this is the only film she ever made -- plays a slave woman who is in love with her owner. She is light skinned, and is allowed to be dignified. Other, darker slaves are shown as idiotic and animal-like, or as so overjoyed by the presence of their slave owner that they burst into spirituals.

Sidney Poitier plays a slave who has been treated well by his master, Clark Gable.

Poitier repays Gable for this excellent treatment by scheming for Gable's death. It is only when Gable reveals that he is Poitier's father that Poitier realizes his appropriate love for the man who owned him and raped his African mother.

In the film's capstone scene, where Gable talks about the horrors of the slave trade, Gable describes savage Africans as doing most of the dirty work. Gable, poor, innocent white slave trader, physically fights against the Africans who are savaging their own people in order to supply him, Gable, with human cargo.

For any decent person, watching this scene of white denial is gut wrenching.

Finally, Yankees arrive. They are every bit as bad as the Yankees in GWTW. The poor, stupid slaves who welcome their arrival, Gable intones, are not intelligent enough to realize how lucky they had it under their beneficent Southern owners.

Again, if you like seeing beautiful women in pretty costumes, and if you want to see Yvonne de Carlo's bodice ripped -- six or seven -- I lost count -- men in the film attempt to have their way with her -- and if ""woman falls in love with rapist"" plots are your cup of tea, and if you can ignore the nauseating denial that underlies this exercise, then you may enjoy this movie.

Otherwise, it is more of sociological interest than aesthetic.",1133568000,26,4908,4.691948658109685
541648,5,6303049001,I have always loved this move. I have had a hard time finding this movie. I still can't find it on DVD.This movie has so much raw emotion of our history and an era of time that was terribly inhuman. It shows how a man can over come his predigious and greed and use his position for good. It shows a he-man becoming a real man.,1130112000,12,326,3.9545454545454546
541649,5,6303049001,"This movie is great.  It is amazing to me that few people even know of its existance.  The plot of the movie stems from it's main character Amantha Starr portrayed by Yvonne De Carlo.  After hearing that her father is ill, she returns home to her plantation in Kentucky to not only finding her father dead and bankrupt, but also finding out that she is a child of the plantation and will be sold like all the other slaves.  She is adamant that this is not true until she sees paperwork that proves otherwise.  She is then bought at auction by former slave trader and plantation owner Hamish Bond, played wonderfully by Clark Gable.  He doesn't want her for a slave, but for his woman which adds to many other complications, such as the jealousy of another slave that from what the movie hints to is the lady of the plantation.  Then there is also one of the best performances that I have ever seen him in is Sidney Poitier as Rarou, a slave on Bond's plantation that he has raised like a son.  He is very upset that Starr would deny her African roots and ""keep on living the white lie,"" as she states in the movie.  Two of the best scenes in this movie is when Gable explains how he came across Rarou and spared his life from the slave catchers and when Poitier and De Carlo are in the abandoned mansion and he is discussing how could she pretend to be something that she is not.  That scene had a climatic ending.  Also there is a Sgt. Seth Parsons that is sweet on ""Manty"" and is trailing her because he too wants to marry her and take her away from her ""terrible"" life.  When she was younger and sweet on Seth he was on his way to being a minister and trying not to delve into the ways of man.  Oh how things have changed.  If you like the drama of the era of the civil war, you will enjoy this movie.  It exposes lots of layers that are seldom seen in such cinematic efforts.",1114300800,23,1879,4.209497206703911
541650,5,6303049001,"Band of Angels is a very well-written screenplay about the oddities of race in America.  I would have to compare it with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" only I think Band of Angels is more thought provoking.
The plot involves a pre-Civil War Southern belle (whose father has sent her to school in the north which should give you a hint) who returns to Kentucky when her father falls ill.  She arrives to see him being buried, and immediately afterwards hears first that her father was bankrupt and all the slaves will be sold and then that she herself is the child of a slave woman and therefore she too will be sold.  It seems her father had an affair with a mulatto slave and raised the child as if the mother had been white and married to him.  He has (somewhat unbelievably) concealed this from his child, who doesn't understand why her mother is buried outside the family cemetery.  Our beautifully-dressed belle ends up being literally sold down the river -- she leaves pleasant Kentucky to be sold on a New Orleans auction block. (The further south you got, the worse conditions were: the other slaves are probably going to end up on a mosquito-infested sugar cane plantation and face a much worse fate than she does, but the movie fails to make this point). It's an eye-opener how particularly shocking the slave auction is when an apparently white woman is being auctioned -- which gives a lot of insight into subliminal racism.
Although a bit dated at parts (the music at the beginning, for example, and the scenes with the slaves singing like a choir), this is a very thought-provoking and yet entertaining movie.  I highly recommend it.",1087257600,96,1640,4.657439446366782
541651,5,6303049001,"This wonderful American Civil War drama stars as Amantha, Yvonne De Carlo as a sultry southern belle, who is hiding the secret of her Black ancestry. Clark Gable plays Hamish Bond, the swashbuckling landowner, who, despite her various suitors, is the only man who Amantha ever loved.
After the end war and the occupation of the South by the Union troops, Bond must flee for his life from the vengeful northerners. It is up to a former slave,, now a Union Sergeant (Sydney Poitier) to decide how the drama will play itself out.
While Bond was good to him, and gave him an education and all that enabled him to advance, his heart is still bitter at the experience of knowing he was a slave.
The movie gives a good account of the brutality of both slavery, and the rape of the South by Union forces after the Civil War. We see the routine violation of Southern women by the occupying Northern soldiers.
Made in 1957, this movie is one of the classic masterpieces.",1075334400,16,960,4.522988505747127
541652,4,6303049001,"It would be interesting to know how audiences reacted to this movie when it was first released in 1957. I never knew that African slaves got packed into ships like sardines until I saw the miniseries ""Roots,"" yet in this movie Clark Gable reveals the shameful story of how Africans were captured (sometimes with the help of other Africans) and packed into slave ships, and how cruelly they suffered. It is like seeing the other side of Rhett Butler, a very dark side. I don't consider this movie to be so much a romantic story as it is a story about forgiveness and the hope of a new and better era. I never knew that Sidney Poitier and Clark Gable had been in a film together, and it is a treat to see two such great actors confronting each other. Poitier plays his character superbly--he is rightfully impatient for freedom and justice, yet he knows he has to watch his step or else he will be crushed. ""Gone with the Wind"" seems very shallow compared to this movie.",970790400,72,968,4.443820224719101

BAND OF ANGELS kept more innocent  moviegoing audiences of its day sufficiently enthralled to make it a  success.

7835366,1,6303049001,"Review of Band of Angels
Hot Toasty Rag, November 21, 2017

While Band of Angels has a very captivating premise, its so terrible youll wonder why you didn't just watch Gone with the Wind for the thirtieth time instead of taking a chance on it. Its another Civil War drama that takes place on a large Southern plantation, starring Clark Gable without a Southern accent. The costumes, designed by Marjorie Best, are breathtakingly beautiful, however, and every bit as lovely and authentic looking as Walter Plunketts costumes in Gone with the Wind. The clothes are really the only good part of the film, so if you're the type of person who watches movies only to look at the costumes, rent this one.

Yvonne De Carlo is a Southern belle, but when her father dies, her mothers race is revealed. Not only is Yvonne the descendant of a slave, but she has lost her inheritance to her fathers plantation and fortune, and shes carted off to the selling block and sold as a slave. Wealthy plantation owner Clark Gable buys her with intentions to make her his mistress. I know the plot sounds like something youd want to watchit sounded that way to me, toobut there are lots of reasons why the film was so torturous. Either director Raoul Walsh gave his actors atrocious advice on how to deliver their lines, or everyone was naturally atrocious without his help. Clark Gable rattles off his lines the way he always does, quickly, without feeling, and with a sense that hes not really listening to himself. Carolle Drake, Clarks former slave mistress, reads her lines with worse delivery than a cold audition. And, as if to make up for it, Tommie Moore, another of Clarks slaves, hams up every single line as if she belongs in a bad community theater production.

If horrible acting doesnt bother you, Max Steiners score will. Just as an example, when Rex Reason announces hes been recruited to make speeches for President Lincoln, Maxs music plays Ive Been Working on the Railroad as he triumphantly leaves for his assignment. Its classic Max Steiner, which means hell use silly ditties and score a drama as if its a cartoon.

On a side note, Sidney Poitier plays Clark Gables head slave. In the story, he seethes and resents Clarks kindness, and in his major scenes, he plays more a villain than a hero. I cant imagine white audiences in the 1950s were pleased with his character; its pretty amazing he had a career after this movie.",1511222400,,2424,4.683098591549296
