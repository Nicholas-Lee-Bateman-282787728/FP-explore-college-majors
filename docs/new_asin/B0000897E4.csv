7980723,1,B0000897E4,"If you are getting this disc because you think it's the only one available for US players with a French language option, DON'T DO IT! THERE IS NO FRENCH OPTION! It's the same as all of the other English language Caillou discs. Why is it so difficult to find children's programming in French?",1296086400,6,291,4.509433962264151
7980724,2,B0000897E4,"This was a dissapointment because it was tagged ""no puppets"" and every other episode was puppets! The kids always want to fast forward over them because they don't like them (I find them very annoying).This makes watching the dvd (especially in the car) a real pain in the neck.",1224115200,6,278,4.6938775510204085
7980725,5,B0000897E4,Caillou has not lost it's appeal even for older children.  My children are ages six and nine and they both still love Caillou.  We wish we could find more Caillou items but they are almost impossible to find.  This show will be a favorite for our grandchildren as well.  It is a great investment and a wonderful treat for the whole family!,1166572800,2,339,4.419354838709677
