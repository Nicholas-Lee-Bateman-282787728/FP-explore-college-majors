5451010,3,B00AMFKPXA,"I might have given this DVD a better rating if the audio and video were properly synchronized, but, at least on my copy, the video lags the audio by about 5 seconds, on average. On another note, there is no mention given of piranhas or of other fish; there is, in fact, little video of the diverse animal life. There is, however, extensive coverage of some of the flora.",1382745600,,370,4.3768115942028984
5451011,1,B00AMFKPXA,"The cover picture of a jaguar looks great, but that is the only thing nice about this 3d DVD.  If you like looking at half-dead, waterlogged trees and plants, than you will be enraptured by this boring DVD.  Very few animals are shown and the ones that are are in a zoo.

5451013,1,B00AMFKPXA,"At first I was really bothered that the EXTREMELY grating narrator was always speaking 10 seconds out of sync with the visual.

But then it was tree branches, tree branches, and more tree branches.  It might as well have been a tour of a river in New Jersey!

Finally, in the last 5 minutes, a bunch of quick shots of animals in a Brazilian zoo, including a 6 second overhead shot of the back of a caged jaguar (because of the sound sync problems it was described as a monkey).

And that staged shot at the end of local natives dancing in a hut!?!?  Those people looked annoyed!

The whole thing was just really depressing.",1382745600,,623,4.373913043478261

They have pictures of animals on the front cover and back that give it the illusion that it will be interesting, but the whole video is just panoramic shots of trees and plants put to some annoying music.  The narrator is also terrible.  The closest thing you get to wildlife is a few random shots of birds.  If you like a boring video of trees and flowers, that was probably shot in the span of 2 days, than this video is for you.",1382486400,16,516,4.079207920792079

5451024,1,B00AMFKPXA,"Who said this was a 3D Blu-Ray? I want my money back as it was not at all 3D.

It appears that Kenneth Wright wanted to recover his visit costs and therefore took a video camera and shot the animal scenes in a zoo and placed the cameras on either side of the boat to capture the scenario from either side.

Amazon should not allow such DVDs to be sold with false advertisement that is a 3D Blu-ray.

Wonder, if I will get a refund for this purchase!
it deserves none.

5451027,1,B00AMFKPXA,"Don't let the cover of this video mislead you. There are very few scenes of wildlife in this documentary, and the animals that are in this video were filmed at a zoo. Other than a captive jaguar and a captive howler monkey, the only other animals in this video are a few birds and a couple of insects. Ninety percent of the footage is close-up shots of leaves. The narrator's high pitched British accent is annoying and the script (at times) does not coincide with some of the scenes. The 3D affects in this video are not that impressive.

5451029,1,B00AMFKPXA,"How could anyone justify charging money for this? It's not a movie, it's a guy traveling by boat with a video camera who's afraid to go into the jungle. Endless footage of leaves. The only animal shots are taken at a zoo- nothing like the leopard on the cover.

Should I bring a 3D camera on my next vacation and the sell the DVD? I'm guessing that was the author's idea for making a quick buck at the expense of suckers like me who purchased this DVD.

I'll never buy anything by this studio again, ""3D-MEDIA.tv"".",1388102400,,514,4.34375
5451030,1,B00AMFKPXA,"This has got to be the absolute WORST movie ever made on the Amazon.  Literally 3/4 of it are are over exposed shots of foliage. They should be ashamed selling this and calling it a movie. It is something a novice film maker might do, with a 3D camera. It is also totally misleading. The photo of the Jaguar on the cover leads one to believe that a Jaguar was filmed in the wild, not so. It in some small animal zoo like thing.
Do not waste your money, really, just don't do it.",1387756800,,478,4.085106382978723

5451032,1,B00AMFKPXA,"After having worked in wildlife conservation and environmental education in Guyana, South America (just north of the Amazon river basin) for several years, I had high hopes for this documentary. I was very much disappointed. The greater part of the film consisted of over-exposed footage of many plant species, the vast majority of which were not even talked about in the out of sync narration. There were perhaps 5-7 out of about 1300 Amazon bird species that were highlighted in the film. None of which i would consider to be worthy representatives of the beauty or complexity of the region. Besides the birds, three turtle species and 5 or so mammals are highlighted. All which were clearly filmed in a zoo. Do yourself a favor and watch planet earth or other quality documentaries. This is a complete waste of time.",1387670400,5,819,4.857142857142857
5451033,1,B00AMFKPXA,first 15 min is of leaves. Then you see some low definition shots of birds . Then more leaves. Not once do you see a forest.  You see the cat on the cover of the dvd for about one min and it looks like it is in a cage.  You do see a monkeys butt and that is exactly j ow I would describe this movie,1387152000,5,298,3.5
5451034,2,B00AMFKPXA,"This was a great disappointment I had expected far more. I expected a journey form Amazonas source to the Atlantic Ocean. I didn't have any idea there these films has been made. No maps no explanations how, there and then! Yes we did see a Jaguar two times for a few seconds but most of the time animals were missing. However more time was used to show different trees!",1386633600,,369,4.36231884057971
5451035,2,B00AMFKPXA,"Lets start off with the positives:

The 3D is shot with actual 3D cameras. There are some amazing shots that pop out of the screen.

The narration is remarkably better than Ken Wright's previous releases.

The bitrate is noticably higher than it was on Europe's Most Beautiful Places.

They seem to be using newer cameras than they did on Europe's Most Beautiful Places.

There is a music-only track

Now for the negatives

I wasn't able to get past 20 minutes of this. Maybe the BBC and Discovery has spoiled me, but I found this boring. This is very much an amature production. The entire show looks like it was filmed in a wildlife perserve - in one of the early shots, there is clearly a fence in the picture.

Some shots seem to be recycled over and over again.

This is mostly a video of plants. Kinda misleading compared to the cover image.

Narration around the 15 minute mark gets to where it is about 20-30 seconds ahead of what is onscreen. They are talking about iguanas, but you are looking at images of grasshoppers. They start talking about a a rainbow lizard, and they switch to the video of the iguana. They then start talking about the river, and switch to the video of the lizard. Music when we see the river, then they start talking about a yellow-feathered bird, but you are looking at white birds. When you do see the yellow birds, music is playing.

The 3D depth of field jumps greatly from one shot to the next. Many of the early shots are shot from a distance, and there is almost no 3D effect. Quick transition to a closeup of a branch sticking out of the screen, and as soon as your eyes and brain adjust, you are thrown into another shot with another 3D depth being used. The issue is - while the shots individually look neat, the constantly changing field of depth produces headaches. I had to pause the video after only 10 minutes and shut it off completely after 20, and I can normally sit thorugh an entire 2-3 hour 3D movie.

Some shots look like they were shot without adjusting the iris or color balance on the camera.

In a nutshell, its NOT HORRIBLE, but it certainly was not what I was expecting. I will admit, though, that my expectations were lower after having a couple of this guy's other discs, which may be why I am not being as hard on the discs as others are.

Just don't go into this expecting a professional production. There are some amazing shots here, but just be prepared for watching a lot of plants.",1386547200,,2453,4.4222222222222225
5451036,1,B00AMFKPXA,"The Panther on the cover art, and almost all animals in this movie are filmed in a small zoo. Don't watch this movie to see wildlife you won't even see a monkey, however there are several shots of a for the Amazon very common black bird. Boring non educational stuff. 3D Is not great. Sorry there is no wild nature in this blu-ray.",1386288000,,331,4.26984126984127

5451038,1,B00AMFKPXA,"Too much tree's and not enough animals. It's nice in 3D but after a while it gets boring of watching nothing but trees.

5451039,3,B00AMFKPXA,the out of screen is great. but thats the only reason i give it 3 stars. it talks about so many animals on the cover but shows very few. most of this dvd is of trees and water. its still a good 3d but thats just for the out of screen. i was really expecting more animal shots.  if you buy this don't expect much more than lots of trees and water and few animals,1385251200,,361,3.8133333333333335
5451040,1,B00AMFKPXA,"Very Bad, the sound is out of sync with the video so it talks about something while still showing something else.

5451042,1,B00AMFKPXA,"I couldn't even watch it more than ten minutes. The narrative is lazy (general information collected in a quick search in the web) and the images seems like have been made by amateurs in a holiday trip (but with a 3d camera). Save the money. If you want to see something of excellent quality about that region get the ""Andes to Amazon"" BBC documentary or similar (even if not available in 3D)",1384646400,,392,4.458333333333333
5451043,1,B00AMFKPXA,"Oh jeez these Ken Wright videos are terrible. I have 4 of them and they all suffer from low production quality, boring photography and cheesy 3d overlays on 2d backgrounds. Why oh why doesn't Amazon hire somebody to preview these before they offer them to the public?  There aren't enough 3d productions and my thirst for content led me to trust Amazon's promotion. Ugh these videos suck; Yellowstone, Africa too!  Pull these dogs off the market.  It is certainly possible to do this well in 3d. National Geographic has a few solid productions. This producer needs to watch them to learn about narration (banal and mindless blathering) and what comprises a beautiful sweeping vista (Ken focuses on a boring plot of grass for minutes at a time--so dull).",1384473600,,753,4.8671875
5451044,3,B00AMFKPXA,"If you have a big 3D TV in your house and you are desperate for 3D material that is not animated or horror, then you might appreciate this documentary. But do not expect an Attenborough type film. This is not even close to being a wildlife documentary.
You will see a few wild creatures but the Jaguar pictured on the cover is not in the film. You will see the top side of a Jaguar that is a captive animal, and a few other captives, and you will see a handful of birds perched in the forest, and a few vultures which get overtime due to the overall lack of animals captured on film. There is a lot of wonderful footage of the forest and a lot of water from a surface viewpoint, which I enjoy, and the 3D effect of the film in the forest is great if you want to feel like you can pick leaves in your living room. But you're going to want to do it with the sound turned off, becuase the mournful violin music is dreadful and the narration is not good enough to overcome it. You will not hear the natural sounds of the forest at all. If you have a rainforest CD maybe you can play it while you watch the video and sort of get into it. The timing of the narration is even a little off.",1384041600,,1182,4.012711864406779
5451045,1,B00AMFKPXA,"I am really dissappointed in this DVD. The technical quality is quite good but the content is not interesting. Most of the scenes have been shot to show how clever we are in showing off 3D effects. Mostly foliage shots, poor editing, ridiculous sound track, less than accurate commentary. We recently spent 5 days in Ecuadorian amazon,so I have a good idea of what it is really like! Don't waste your money buying this",1384041600,9,418,4.662162162162162
5451046,1,B00AMFKPXA,This video seriously sucked.  The vast majority of it was filmed in a boat looking at the trees and plants on the side of the river.  The few animals it did show appeared to be in a refuge or zoo.  Absolutely terrible.  Even the editing was off.  The narrator would talk about a bird and it would finally get to the bird 10 seconds later.  The 3d effects were good if you are into looking at plants and bushes. Would have given it zero stars but you have to give at least one.  We didn't even finish it...fast forwarded through most of it and then fast forwarded it into the garbage can.,1383955200,,587,4.1875
5451047,1,B00AMFKPXA,"Worst Nature film ever. 90 percent was on plants hardly any animals a Jaguar and a dolphin at the end,couple birds,seriously I could have made a better one.

5451048,1,B00AMFKPXA,Can I give it a zero?! This video is horrible unless you like to look at the bottom of trees sitting in 2 feet of water. The narrator should invest in voice lessons. The pics on the cover look so exciting but the video is anything but.,1383782400,7,235,4.0212765957446805
5451049,1,B00AMFKPXA,The only cool thing is the jaguar on the cover that yu see for .5 seconds with the audio talking about something not on the screen yet.

5451050,4,B00AMFKPXA,"Well, I ordered this disc, the day it was released and it took 7 days to reach Calcutta, India from US. No doubt, that I was eager to watch it, however while the shipment was on her way, I read some reviews which really make me disappointed !! Nevertheless, I found this as :

Topic : the documentary is all about the Amazon rainforest, where her flora is 95% and fauna  is just 5% covered, though nothing is covered on River Amazon and her water lives. This may be a nice relaxation video for THOSE WHO LOVES JUNGLE.

3D effects: Excellent. It doesn't mean you will feel ""out of the screen"" effects more often, because of her topics, but no out of focus for the near / distant object is prominent. Clarity of picture with high resolutions make the forest more real !! You will have WINDOW EFFECTS (as if you are peeping through window) for such scenarios most of the time.

Narrative: The whole documentary is laid over by orchestra symphony, which at times, feels monotonous or annoying. It could have been much better presentation, if somewhere natural sound is superimposed ! One of the main technical drawback is the synchronization of narration with video, which really lags with the video ! You will see narration of monkey but their presence in the screen will be visual after some time.",1383436800,2,1295,4.593073593073593
5451051,2,B00AMFKPXA,"I purchased this DVD thinking there would be a lot of animals in 3D. What you get is a lot of video of plants, trees and river shots.

5451052,2,B00AMFKPXA,"I'll echo what others have said about the lingering shots on a subject while the narrator had already moved on to the next subject.  Quite a few of those moments in the film as well as too many shots of water, plants and trees and not nearly enough shots of the wild and insect life. I'll also add that there are some very nice 3D shots in the movie.  There's one when it's raining and the rain is outside of the screen and others where large plant leaves extend outwards.  There are also shots that have great depth.  There are no atmospheric sounds, just wall to wall music that is relaxing but it can't compare to sounds of the animals, birds and insects in the rain forest.",1383091200,7,677,4.307086614173229
5451053,5,B00AMFKPXA,"I did not really expect much from this disc as I have been extremely disappointed in the 3D videography in many of the nature documentary features lately - and this is not a BBC or IMAX production.  What a surprise!  The 3D is shot with the ""window"" purposely set back so that many items in the view actually DO COME OUT OF THE SCREEN ON A REGULAR BASIS.  It is a disc that I will be using to illustrate proper 3D camerawork.

As to the content - well, it is just as others have described.  90% of the content is that of the jungle plants in the Amazon forests, and of the water levels in those forests at various times of the year when the Amazon floods the plains.  Very little content of animals.  And the narration, mostly in the middle section of the disc, is up to 15 seconds ahead of the pictures it is describing - and it can get quite annoying.  This is a pressing or editing fault and really should have been discovered.  And the lag time varies through-out the disc.  The music, on the other hand, does cue up to the photography - but it tends to get monotonous.

So, if you are interested in 3D videography - get this disc.  If you are interested in an interesting video on the Amazon - by all means get the IMAX 2D Blu-ray ""Amazon,"" it is far more informative and entertaining.  What a shame it was not filmed in 3D!",1382918400,2,1329,4.205533596837944

Don't forget the few minutes of heart pounding footage of wild animals in their enclosures at what must pass for a rainforest roadside attraction. The video is dominated by some interestingly layered footage of rainforest flora, which could be included in a BBC or other legitimate production company's transition scenes. Good cure for insomnia. I gave 3 stars because the cinematography is often interesting to look at. I'm not sure who put up the money for these productions (I include Galapagos 3D, Wild Africa 3D, and Papua 3D in this statement. They appear to have been made by the same production company) but I would imagine they're a little disappointed. Kind of the visual equivalent of ambient music.
