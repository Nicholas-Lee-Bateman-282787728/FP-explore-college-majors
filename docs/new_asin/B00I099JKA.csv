6244937,5,B00I099JKA,"Jack Lemmon was such a great star in almost everything he did, he was able to rise above bad material and make it better.  None of these are great films but they are something you watch when you have that quiet night at home and you are looking for something that won't make you work too hard to watch.  The plots are pretty silly and some of the other cast are not up to his standard but at the right price for a Lemmon fan a good deal.",1487548800,,437,3.9545454545454546

6244941,4,B00I099JKA,"Great collection. Operation Madball is a terrific Lemmon vehicle with a classic Ernie Kovaks as well. Good Neighbor Sam is a classic. The Notorious Landlady pairs Lemmon with Kim Novak in a stellar performance by both. Three for the Show is the weakest of the bunch but OK to watch. My one disappointment is these movies are neither subtitled nor close captioned, something those who put out old movies should consider since those of us likely to buy them are older folks more likely to have some hearing loss. (The collections TCM puts out are subtitled in contrast to both Jack Lemmon Showcase Volumes put out by Millcreek. At least the transfer quality of these films is good.)",1473379200,3,680,4.771186440677966

6244955,4,B00I099JKA,"Disc 1
This is a fine combo pack w/ 3 good films and 1 fair. 'Operation Mad Ball' is a B&W 1957 military spoof w/ Lemmon, Ernie Kovacs, etc., but Kovacs doesn't come off so well as the mean captain. His shtick is comedy. Not much of a military movie fan.
 'Good Neighbor Sam', 1964, beautiful Eastman Color by Pathe, plot is lacking, but non-stop action and lots of color in this madcap screwball comedy romp keeps the attention. The color is a welcome relief to the 2 b&white films. Shows in fullscreen on my wide screen in cinema mode.

Disc 2
 'The Notorious Landlady', B&W 1962, is the best film of this group and a great who-dunnit comedy w/ Kim Novak & Lemmon.  Estelle Winwood is priceless, too. It's worth being colorized and should have been made in color.  Screenplay by Blake Edwards and Larry Gelbart.
'Three for the Show', 1954 Technicolor, photographed in  CINEMASCOPE w/ Betty Grable is a delightful musical kind of tale w/ legendary dance team Marge & Gower Champion. Terrific colorful abstract contemporary dance sequences, plenty of costumes & lots of color make this a real eye opener. Shows in wide letterbox on my wide screen in cinema mode.

All of these movies on both discs played fine on my old DVD player. Jack Lemmon - lively, spontaneous, and always worth watching. Had wished to own something with Betty Grable, Marge & Gower, and got Dorothy Provine, Louis Nye, Romy Schneider, Kathryn Grant, Kim Novak, Mike Connors (Mannix), Fred Astaire, in the bargain, too. Noticed no profanity and no nudity.

Why would I go out to a movie when I can pay less and get all four of these excellent classics for home viewing in solid comfort?!",1453593600,3,1659,4.657534246575342

6244964,4,B00I099JKA,"Bought this Volume for Good Neighbor Sam that I originally saw back in the day at a NJ Drive In.  Cast includes Dorothy (circa It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World) Provine, Michael ""Mannix"" Conners, and Romy ""The Cardinal"" (Never saw it?  You Should!) Schneider.  Love/recall the whole ""Hertz"" commercial part of this movie as much as I do appearing on Sonny Fox's ""Wonderama"" back in the early 60s at the age of 6 or 7 (big you're 67? interview joke) and was shocked to see that Sonny's set (which reminded me of a living room) was just 3 walls because the cameras needed to move about.

Didn't know anything about the rest of the movies in this volume and did manage, after several viewings each, to get through them.

Bottom Line?  A fan of Good Neighbor Sam?  This is for you.",1432425600,,777,4.429577464788732

I liked her films... she was in too few American films...THE VICTORS was my introduction to her and THAT was an amazing film.

6244981,5,B00I099JKA,"What a great set. If you like Jack Lemmon, and I mean who doesn't like Jack Lemmon? Well then this is the set for you. The set consists of 4 movies. ***Spoilers follow*** The first is Operation Mad Ball, it  is worth the price of the set alone. Here Lemmon is a military man stationed in France with a medical station. Well, you can guess that the enlisted men are not allowed to date the nurses. Lemmon, is the go to guy for everything you need. You need it, Lemmon's character can make it happen. As a result he is also the camp screw-up. But, he always finds a way out of trouble. There is tremendous star power in this movie, from Mickey Rooney, Aurther O'connel, Ernie Kovacks, and Dick York. There are many others as well as a very young James Darren.

The next movie good neighbor Sam is a wife switching/husband switching screwball comedy with ducks. Here Lemmon plays an everyman, ad exec with a clean cut reputation. A reputation that gets him an ad campaign and a promotion. However, all is not as it seems. Lemmon must act like the husband of a divorcee so that she can inherit $15 million. Then her husband returns.  What happens next is hilarious.

The third movie ""The Notorious Landlady"" takes place in London. Here Lemmon is a diplomat from America, who happens to rent an apartment/flat from a woman labeled as having murdered her husband. Lemmon is immediately attracted to her, and his boss played by Fred Astair is not thrilled, as he fears fallout from the bad press generated by Lemmon's association with this woman. Scotland Yard is involved, and they try to prove her guilt. Things get even hotter when the husband shows up and she kills him in self defense. It's a hilarious who done it with Jack Lemmon and Kim Novak as the landlady.

The forth movie ""Three For Show"" is a musical comedy. I personally don't like musical's, so this one is not for me. However, if you do like musical's this is a great entry into the set. The choreography is amazing, and the story is funny. ***Spoiler Alert*** Here, Lemmon is an air force pilot who went down on a desert island 2 years prior to the story's beginning. His wife informed that he was was dead, due to a military clerical error remarries Lemmon's writing partner. The story begins with Lemmon returning from the dead/island. And, now his wife is married to two people. She is left with the problem of choosing out of the two men she loves, who she wants to spend the rest of her life with. In the meantime, a visit to the military leads her to believe she can remain married to both of them indefinitely. The music and comedy ensue from there on.  Like I said, it's not for me due to the musical aspect, but it is a good movie non the less.

I give the first 3 movies 5 stars each, and the fourth 2 stars due to the musical aspect, the story is a four star story.

I highly recommend this set for the first three movies, and just for fun, watch the fourth, I did, after all I bought the whole set, might as well see it all.

I've just started to realize what a fan I am of Jack Lemmon.  I've seen dozens of his films, but if I'd be asked if I was a fan I would have said no.  But as it turns out, I really am.  He made movies better with his presence alone, and when he had great material, his work was sublime.  These aren't his best movies, but they still show what a wonderful comic actor he was.",1496880000,,597,3.933333333333333
