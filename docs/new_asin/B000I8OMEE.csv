2653985,1,B000I8OMEE,"Wow, I would have never have guessed it to be this bad. How the heck did National Lampoons fall so far. And Paris Hilton...Why?  She is not so HOT. I will never say the word HOT after this film, I will always refer to it as ""the opposite of cold"".  Just bad all around. Blockbuster would be mad at me for burning this, but I will be saving many other Bored guys who thought this movie might have been entertaining.  Wow, embarressed that I even took the time to write this review under my name its so bad.",1166572800,12,505,4.13265306122449
2653986,1,B000I8OMEE,"I can not believe this carries the National Lampoon's name, and can be associated with Animal House and Vacation.  This movie was just plain bad, did not flow well, poor acting, and paris hilton and the other gals of Gamma Gamma were hideous twigs (with thick make up, poor teeth from vomiting, and bags under their eyes from hangovers).  Paris played herself, a spoiled rich girl, but what could one expect.  For as highly advertised as this was, big let down.  There were a few amusing spots, but the rest could be watched in fast forward.  Let this one rot.",1166486400,3,560,4.56
2653987,1,B000I8OMEE,"This is not a good way to carry on a tradition for national lampoon (I can't believe this could be associated with clasics like vacation and animal house).  This movie was just plain aweful, in the worst way.  Bad acting, bad script, and paris hilton basically playing herself.  This thing had only a few mildly amusing parts, but overall did not flow well at all.  Just save the cash, let this sit on the shelf and rot.",1166486400,5,420,4.415584415584416
2653988,1,B000I8OMEE,"Paris Hilton is probably the most overrated ugly girl I have ever seen. I think she is up to 14:59 minutes of fame, and it should expire after this movie. I had to turn this movie off within the first thirty minutes.  The movie is horrible, so don't waste your time or money.",1166140800,12,275,4.188679245283019
2654009,5,B000I8OMEE,"Paris Hilton did her job, she did it well I thought. Her part was funny! She plays the character of Victoria English, the president of a sorority called Gamma Gamma. Her character comes off in a way of what one might expect from a girl of a popular and exclusive sorority. All mixed with some Paris Hilton style. Her ending speech was very funny!

As for the movie...

National Lampoon has a tendency to over do sexual humor in their movies. They did that here. Less would've been better. As for the story or performances etc. I don't see anything less here than other movies of the same category that have done pretty well. Go figure, maybe it's timing?

2654013,1,B000I8OMEE,This was an AWFUL movie. If I could give it zero stars I would have but Amazon forces you to at least give it one star. Don't waste your time. Thank heavens I didn't have to pay to see this because if I did I would have been horrified. Paris Hilton is an awful actress--she acts just like she does in real life---really badly!,1214006400,3,326,4.109375
2654014,2,B000I8OMEE,"Victoria English (Paris Hilton) is the rich, beautiful, and sadistic president of the Gamma Gamma sorority. She delights in torturing her  underlings and is especially cruel to new pledges.  Victoria excuses her behavior by thinking that everyone wants to be like her anyway.  Her  goal in life is to grace the  cover of FHM magazine. The magazine is running a contest to find the hottest sorority and Vicky is willing to do whatever it takes to win the coveted title. What it takes is for her to relax her tough standards of admittance to the sorority and allow girls that she would never think of speaking to pledge. Victoria searches for girls who she thinks will be so flattered by  her attention that they won't realize that she is setting them up for public humiliation. The freshmen dorm has been closed down thanks to an exploding toilet and luckily for Victoria they  are in need of a place to stay. The cliches abound since the group includes a fat girl, a lone black girl, a few lesbians, and a hot  exchange student. She is of Indian descent and since no one can pronounce her full name they call her Poo Poo for short. There is also an older woman who is pledging in the hopes of sleeping with some hot college guys to get back at her cheating husband. The wife has just undergone  a disastrous boob job which she's  more than happy to show off to her terrified roommates. The movie gives us our heroine in the form of Paula Garces. She's  the one level headed girl of the group which is to say she  is  the most sensitive and vulnerable. The freshmen meet Victoria and the hazing begins. First up for the girls is hunting for used condoms at four in the morning. As the Garce's character performs her degrading task of finding used rubbers she meets Victoria's abused boyfriend who she has just  kicked out of her room forcing him to sleep outside on a picnic table. He is played by Simon Rex. Sick of putting up with Victoria he helps the freshmen bring her down and end her reign of terror. The cast isn't exactly strong if Hilton is your main star but they do decent enough considering the lack of material to work with. There is some comedic talent  in the presence of Reno 911's Kerri Kinney as the horny wife. D lister Taylor Negron plays a Kama Sutra professor who is the recipient of a lap dance from Hilton.(Her double that is.) Carmen Electra shows up for one scene and the filmmakers even saw fit to throw Paris's aunt into the mix by having her play a fashion teacher. As you might expect from a DVD that bills itself as ""the naughty version"" there is a generous amount of nudity. This is where the director goes all out because why have one topless chick onscreen when you can have five. It's  all the nudity and sex in the film which bothered Hilton and caused her to  disown it.  This would have marked her film debut  but it was held up for a while (wonder why) in which time House of Wax was released first. The funniest moment in this film occurs during the credits. After William Heins is identified as being responsible for this and Hilton is  implicated as one of the producers a title card comes up saying ""Additional Scenes directed by Stratherford.."" I won't name names here Stratherford but it turns out that all the nudity was an afterthought. The producers didn't think the film was appealing enough so they had someone go back and insert more sex into the film hoping to reach a wider audience. Pledge This is like the teen version of Caligula. Hilton and the director thought they were making a serious film but sneaky producers sexed it up and completely ruined the finished film.  What do people expect of a film that stars Hilton and that went straight to DVD? Of course it sucks so don't even waste your time or money  if you hate Paris and think the film  looks terrible. I personally love bad movies and usually find some redeeming thing in them but I can't say that I found anything in this film. There are three good looking women to enjoy though. Hilton, Garces, and Noureen DeWolfe (Poo Poo) are all very attractive ladies and they all appear in their underwear at some point.  The lone bonus feature is a making of which features Hilton being mobbed by the press at Cannes where she promoted the film. It also features such acting heavyweights as Randy Spelling and Geoffrey Arend (the pyramid scheme guy from Garden State) boldly declaring that Pledge This is going to become a new comedy classic. Keep dreaming guys.",1211068800,3,4472,4.506188118811881
2654015,3,B000I8OMEE,"If you're thinking when you buy this movie ""Sweet i'll get to see Paris Hilton naked"" then buy One Night In Paris because this movie dosen't have it. It had some good parts but not what you expected. Now i'm not saying don't buy it but beware.",1193702400,,243,4.191489361702128
2654016,1,B000I8OMEE,Has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Nothing worth viewing here. I would give it zero stars if possible.,1185062400,2,112,4.136363636363637
2654017,1,B000I8OMEE,"In ""National Lampoon's Pledge This!"" Paris Hilton is ""Victoria English,"" president of South Beach University's fiercely exclusive sorority ""Gamma Gamma."" Everyone adores her, worships her and wants to be accepted by her, and everyone wants to be like her ... are you still listening?

Reese Witherspoon might have this uninspired story watchiable with her comedic talent. Sorry, no such luck here because Ms. Witherspoon was not available. Instead you see Paris Hilton doing nothing particularly great, except gliding around the campus in expensive dress or saying something silly smugly. Actually she does nothing even during the film's pie-throwing scenes (yes, there is!) because no pie hits her.

There are toilet jokes (about school toilet ""eating"" a poor girl, and ... er ... about one exploding toilet, no, I'm not kidding) and of course, lots of nudities. But there is more to come after these gross-out gags and the film gets worse. A group of freshmen arrive, mostly stereotyped ""outcasts"" or ""misfits"" and they have to undergo humiliating ""initiation"" in order to be member of the sorority. This part is not just unfunny, but repulsive.

Finally I didn't write the names of co-stars and cameos because most probably they want to forget anything about it all and must have already deleted the name of the film from their CV by now. So please, listen, here is my advice; Avoid this.",1180310400,7,1391,5.065502183406114
2654018,1,B000I8OMEE,"PARIS PARIS PARIS, where do I begin

I know you are a lil rich kid, who is trying to make it as a media star, you know TV seroes, record deal, pin ups. and movies...and your choice are farely great to highlight you...However, this movie is a step back for even you.

This National Lampoon film is neither an ANIMAL HOUSE nor a VACATION. It is real weak film versions of the American Pie series combined with  Bring it On and Legally Blonde films without the cheerleading. John Waters could have made a better film in his sleep..and I think he has!

The plot is confusing story line. Also with 30 year old adults trying to play college cut ups, it seems like these ""KIDS""  seem too old to do some of this CRAZY STUFF.

Their sight gags may make anyone gag. The pie scene steals from ANIMAL HOUSE's & Blazing Saddles's food fight and old three stooges movies..and Paris, you get not a drop of pie on you (AMAZING since you are inthe middle of the tossing)

The one star is for the star of the film, Ms Hilton...who is her screen time makes herself seen. It does not always advance the plot much, but she is beautiful to watch.

2654029,4,B000I8OMEE,"I like this film because several reasons, unlike most of the National Lampoon's I've recently seen, this was the least silly & disgusting. there was a better plot to it, Paris Hilton is a fine actor! alot of people would say she's playing herself in this movie but if u think that, then u don't really know her. but I'm not getting into that. now to the plot, Veronica(Hilton) is the hottest girl in the school, popular, dating the ""hottest"" guy on campus & is totally rich! looking to win a chance to get a photoshoot for FHM, she needs the hottest girls to compete with her. only that doesn't go so well when she starts treating some of the wannabees like crap & they decide to retaliate. there is a journey of self-discovery, lessons to be learned but it's not a big part of the film & kinda comes from nowhere. lots of this doesn't make sense but who cares. it's a very cheesy flick but it has humor, nudity, all the things u'd want from a National Lampoon's flick & I give it points for trying something new & actually having a point to the film!

Since the movie wasn't very entertaining for me (a male), and most of the stars of the movie are female...and the males in the movie are portrayed as idiots (fools), and the plot is mostly about girls trying to get into a sorority....I'm thinking this movie must be a ""chick flick""...a movie for girls.  Guys will hope to see enough college girl nudity to be interesting, but they will be disappointed.  Some Paris Hilton fans may like the movie, but be sure to note that Paris Hilton does not get naked in this movie (...but a few other girls get topless).

What cracked up mind came up with this movie? All of the acting is horrible, the cinematography abysmal, and the plot is pretty much nonexistent.

While it is a film I will never recommend to someone for it's cinematic value, I would recommend it to people who want a good laugh, but it's not necessarily because of the humor, it's because of how awful this movie is.

Paris Hilton was apparently an executive producer.....first, it has become clear this chick has no talent and should not be working behind ANY camera(or in front of), second, did Hilton even go to college? Everything that happens in this disaster is supposed to be a portrayal of college life.
