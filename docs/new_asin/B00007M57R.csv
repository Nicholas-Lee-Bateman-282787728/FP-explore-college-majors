1823272,3,B00007M57R,"This movie was awful the script was unoriginal they just took Tupacs life mixed it up and added a bit of fiction. Characters like lil kim, Faith, and Suge Knight are in the movie. Toni Braxtons acting was awful! I Only bought it because it was one of Merlin Santana's last roles and yes he can act that's a given, so could the rest of the cast - except for the aforementioned - but the script and the terrible rappers (not the actors voices) ... I guess I'll always have Steve Harvey and the cosby show RIP Merlin. 3 stars for the actors.",1300320000,,538,4.233009708737864
1823273,4,B00007M57R,"I have to say i had every intention on seeinq this movie, mainly because of Merlin Santana. but after i seen it i loved it!! It's so honest && upfront about all the shady business and i don't think it is appreciated, not to mention  the actinq i mean who could have ever seen Faison Love as the villian. Also whether it was intended or not this movie is pretty much a play by play of the Tupac vs. Biggie fued but with a few twists . For instance while it is obvious that faison is suge && toni is faith and so on, i think tupac && biggie are a bit mixed. jaxx was pac because of him qoinq to the west coast nd being play'd by domino breed (also notice how the record label was called the block i wonder if that was like the row or whatever). but the fact that he had a wife and mistress and mayhem made the ""i f**ked yur wife"" sonq lol it mixes thinqs up. all in all i loved it =)",1268697600,,881,3.867403314917127
1823274,2,B00007M57R,"Well to start I have to say that I am a devoted Toni Braxton fan. I would not have taken time to see this film if not for her. Nevertheless, I did find the story line old and worn out and the acting in it weak but the music was good it was the redeeming quality of the film.  I myself am not a fan for rap music nor am a hater of it.  My take on the film is that it was an ok film but nothing really good. Just wish that Toni Braxton had done some of the singing in the film, but she did not. She did not even do any of music for the credits, very disappointing. They, the filmmakers, missed something there to have one of the greatest voices of the time in the film and not have her sing one song. Dumb, very dumb. Even if they had to pay her more it would have been worth it.",1197676800,,777,3.731707317073171
1823275,5,B00007M57R,"Firstly, a friend phoned me five times begging me to see this movie and I was not disappointed.

I am going to paraphrase Durrel from Tx. One of the most underrated films and I encourage all ""Hip-Hop Heads to see. Although, this film didn't break any

genres but I thought the film's ending was excellent with Jaxx's lyrics ending the film. ""I got pay for all the wrong the I have done.",1097452800,3,386,4.347222222222222
1823276,4,B00007M57R,"This film is very much underatted for an indie film and as a film period. It is very powerful and emtotional. Merlin Santana was a great actor and it seems a human being as well. He lights up the screen with his looks and charisma as the egotistical Mayhem, and The lead actor in the film gives a good performance as well, If you are a hip hop fan you need this one in the collection.",1074470400,6,384,4.065789473684211
1823277,4,B00007M57R,"THIS WAS A MADE FOR TV MOVIE THAT AIRED IN 2002 ON VH1. WHEN A FEUD BETWEEN TWO RAPPERS START, A DEADLY EAST COAST VS. WEST COAST STREET WAR ALSO STARTS. YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS IS A FICTIONAL VERSION OF THE INFAMOUS BIGGIE VS. TUPAC FEUD. RASHAAN NALL AND MERLIN SANTANA DO GREAT AS THE FEUDING RAPPERS. ANY FAN OF RAP MUSIC SHOULD CHECK OUT THIS MOVIE.

1823279,4,B00007M57R,"After watching the movie, you can figure out who they were talking about. Fazion Love was Suge Knight, Merlin wasw 2Pac, Rashaan Nall was BIggie, Toni Braxton was Faith and Sharissa was Lil Kim. The only person was missing was Puffy. If you know the story behind them and you have the movie.
Aside from that you have a very well done movie that shows how ""fueds"" can get started with simple mistakes. What makes the DVD worth getting is the Merlin Santana tribute. It's about the only one since he was a quick sentence in so called Black Magazines. The DVD is about hte only place where you will hear Merlin's rap skills since he was notable to release any of his four rap albums before his death.",1047945600,5,697,4.410852713178294

1823281,4,B00007M57R,"The only reason I purchased this film is because my daughter is the biggest Fan of Toni Braxton, but I must admit that the movie was rather better than I expected it to be, but it still was not something that I would give 2 thubs up to. The movie starts off kind of slow, but in the end it picks up, to a very bad ending, where a video plays and the movie ends. I would rate this movie with a B-.",1044748800,,396,3.783132530120482
