8169086,4,B000MGUZBG,"As a UFC fan, this event had some good fights.  I bought it while I was away from home and t.v so I started collecting all of the UFC's.  It became just another DVD to the collection.",1349222400,,183,3.918918918918919
8169087,2,B000MGUZBG,"I love the UFC and have been watching it since like 1999, but I can honestly say that I was not that impressed by this event at all. The main event, which was Chuck Liddell vs Renato Sobral, didn't even go that far into the first round, and it was a very UNIMPRESSIVE TKO. Liddell dropped Sobral with a sloppy clip to his head which basically ended the fight, and it wasn't solid at all.

Nick Diaz is one of my favorite fighters, and it was awesome to see him win again, but his bout was MAYBE a 3 out of 5 star rating in my book; not that impressive at all. The rest of the fights were pretty unnimpressive as well, with the exception of Forest Griffin vs Stephan Bonnar. This fight was decent, but not as good as their first fight even in the slightest. Hermes Franca vs Jamie Varner was also a pretty weak fight.

The weak card combined with the fact that the UFC has stopped including pre-fight interviews into the DVD sets puts me into a position to recommend not spending any money on this particular product unless you are a collector and big time fan of the UFC(like me). Otherwise, please go and purchase a better UFC event.",1185235200,3,1134,4.294392523364486
8169088,4,B000MGUZBG,"Hey, this is a 2 take on 2 rematches. First off you've got the big main event, Chuck Liddell defending his title against Renato ""Babalu"" Sobral. These 2 have fought before. When Liddell is featured in a UFC event, and while that Stemm song, ""Face The Pain"" is playing, what happens to be one of his fight highlights? He kicks some poor guy right in the face. And it happens to be Babalu in UFC 40! You also have a rematch that many have waited to see. Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonnar are ready to square off once again.

With both matches you have two opinions in the introduction. Chuck Liddell's take on this is, ""Sooner or later, I'm going to catch you. And you're gonna go down."" Sobral, on the other hand, has an opinion as well. ""One mistake? He's out."" Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonnar are really fired up for their match. Griffin's thoughts are simply, ""If there was ever a time to pair us up to fight as hard as we did it that first fight, it's now."" Bonnar, quite frankly, says, ""To me this is rounds 4, 5 & 6.""

This wasn't bad at all. So, with that said, I'll list the fights below.

Yushin Okami vs. Alan Belcher: After a somewhat uneventful first round, the fight went pretty well. Okami would dominate most of this fight, while Belcher would pull off some moves to get the crowd on their feet at times. This goes to a unanimous decision.

David Heath vs. Cory Walmsley: 2 undefeated fighters making UFC debuts. How would this end? This doesn't last long, not even a round in boxing, ending with a submission. Even includes a shout out to mom to boot!

Wilson Gouveia vs. Wes Combs: Combs is a Marine who served his country proudly, Gouveia is a BJJ black belt. This ends in the 1st round with a submission.

Eric Schafer vs. Rob McDonald: Another quick one, and the loser doesn't even get the opportunity to tap!

Hermes Franca vs. Jamie Varner: Franca looks REAL tough with his green shorts and green hair! What makes Franca such a competitor is that he comes to bring it. He comes hungry from the moment he enters The Octagon. This is a decent fight, and got interesting in the 3rd round where it ended. Quite frankly, this COULD HAVE ended in controversial fashion, but it never did. Jamie Varner did have a point taken away though. OK, enough. Nevertheless, never a boring fight when Franca fights!

Chieck Kongo vs. Christian Wellisch: Big Frenchman against big Hungarian! Cheick impressed in UFC 61 with his knees and strikes. What can I say? He impresses in this one as well. Good fight!

Nick Diaz vs. Josh Neer: Now this is the Nick Diaz that fought Robbie Lawler, Drew Fickett, & Joe Riggs!! That fight with Sean Sherk was embarrassing, even though it went the distance. He came this time ready to talk some smack, and bring his game! Obviously it paid off. Very good fight!

Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar: The long awaited rematch! After all the hype, would this be like their first match-up? It was hyped up for darn good reason, and for once, the talk wasn't just talk. This was a fight, and it was a fight for all 3 rounds. It went to a decision.

Chuck Liddell vs. Renato Sobral: Babalu looked dead serious, while Liddell treated like another day at the office. Very quick ending. Good flurry of fists. If you can't strike with Chuck, then don't strike with Chuck. That simple! Chuck Liddell is still champion.

I'd have to say that if you like good fights with good action, but don't mind most of them ending with submissions, then this will be for you. The action is still great! Don't something simple stop you from watching this. Good stuff in this the whole way through, with a few surprises here and there! I enjoyed this. Hope you enjoy it as well!",1179619200,5,3695,4.482142857142857
