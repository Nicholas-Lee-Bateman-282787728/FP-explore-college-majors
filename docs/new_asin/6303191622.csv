591142,4,6303191622,"Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that in 1872 ""Gedenov, Director of the Imperial Theaters a the time, had considered the idea of producing a work which should combine ballet, opera, and feerie.  ... he had written a program for a theatrical production in 4 acts on a subject taken from the Elb Slavs and had commissioned V.A. Krylov to develop the text.  Mlada, with its fantastic and genre scenes, appeared a most grateful subject for musical portrayal.  Gedenov offered the composition of this music to Cui, Borodin, Moussorgsky, and myself; moreover, the purely ballet numbers were to be composed by Minkus, the official ballet composer of the Imperial Theaters.""

When the joint project fell apart, Rimsky took the project upon himself.  He produced a lush and beautiful work, marvelously sung, danced, and played by the Bolshoi in this DVD.  However, it fails in two ways:  (1) People looking for a musical drama will be severely disappointed:  In Moussorgsky's words, Krylov's text is ""rot .. inspired by ... fumes of delirium.""  There is the semablance of a story but not much more.

(2) The technical limitations of the recording reduce its power.  The wide stage is filled with a vast cast of singers & dancers.  Here, the 4:3 full screen image is particularly confining; wide angle shots lack sufficient definition while up close angle shots fail to give the sweep of the action.  Bartholomew is right that the cameraman only makes it worse.  It is one thing to take many head & torso shots of the singers, another to treat dancers that way.  The sound, while full, is only Dolby 2.0.

I would not lump this work too closely with the TDK recording of Le Coq d'Or.  Here, Rimsky is still fully a member of the Russian 5; on the whole, his music at this time seems richer and more varied.  On the other hand, Le Coq d'Or is a brilliant, ironic drama.  Its production is extraordinary in every detail, and its taping is masterful.",1134950400,30,1926,4.764350453172206
591143,5,6303191622,"If you love La Boheme, Manon and La Traviata you won't care for Mlada. But... if you love Carmen Burana you will love it. The music is gorgeous.  This is called an opera-ballet and it is. There are three stars: the singers, Mlada herself (the ballet)and the wonderful chorus that has a tremendous part. This, along with Rimsky's magnificent Le Coq D'Or are two of the most unique and exciting operas on DVD. Maybe, someday. his Sadko and Tsar Sultan will follow.",1130976000,15,462,4.634146341463414
591144,4,6303191622,"This seldom performed work is a revelation to all who love Russian opera.  It is an amalgamation of Russian culture.  The singing, dancing, and music are all-enveloping.  The staging is magically breath-taking in its originality and yet almost ritualist in its approach.  The use of statues and masks add a primitive yet modernistic touch. But this wonderful performance is practically  ""done in"" by the video director's lack of understanding of the art of filming ballet.  One doesn't focus on faces, limbs, crowds.  You use medium and long shots to show patterns and movement.  Why he focused on the Imp in the Hell Ballet is a wonder to me when there was so much more to see.  Thank heavens he can't ruin Ananiashvili's wonderfully touching performance of Mlada.  I loved it, but was frustrated watching the dreadful camera work.",1130457600,39,832,4.963768115942029

7840447,4,6303191622,"I've embarked on a project to work through all of Rimsky-Korsakov's operas--he composed 15 of them on a wide range of subjects, and they contain most of his music, yet they are rarely performed!

Rimsky approached his musical projects as opportunities to challenge himself and explore new types of musical expression. In Mlada he was working with (and through) Wagner: leitmotivs (though this is not especially new in R-K's music); a long, Philip Glass-like ostinato opening to Act 3 a la the opening of Das Rheingold, to which are added Walkurie style trilling, but serving a different musical purpose.  This also has Rimsky's first true ballet numbers, which make Tchaikovsky's ballets look merely pretty and emotionally shallow by comparison.

This 1890 work seems pointed at the future: Rimsky's pupil Stravinsky clearly drew from Act 3 for the most infernal of his Firebird music, and I cannot believe that Richard Strauss was not familiar with Cleopatra's dance when he was working on Salome's dance of the veils some 15 years later.  The more I hear of Rimsky's music the more I admire and appreciate what he accomplished as a composer.

This DVD is the only way to experience this amazing work, flaws and all, and the trip is worth it, especially with such an amazing dancer as Nina Ananiashvili performing the mute part of the murdered princess who haunts her former lover, as well portraying the ultimate seductress Cleopatra!",1473638400,,1436,5.016806722689076
7840448,5,6303191622,"I decided not to focus on the perceived ""technical flaws"" and surrended to the magic of the dance, the singing, and the grandiose spectacle.
In other words, I loved it.  This will certainly never be presented on the Met's stage!",1428624000,,228,4.7
7840449,5,6303191622,"I have little to add to other reviewers. Yes, for sure, the camera work in this DVD production falls short to be perfect. Yet, this production and this DVD is my very favourite of all filmed operas, and deservedly so.

In the era when, unfortunately, European opera theatres are dominated by the Regietheater, this Bolshoi production of ""Mlada"" (arguably, the most original and unexpected opera by Rimsky-Korsakov) is the masterpiece. Maybe for those more interested in psychology, drama, relations, this production does not seem to be so attractive, but for those very sensitive to archaic forms of being, pantheism, paganism, nature, history, mythology, effects of archetypes and symbols on human behaviour, this production and especially this music should pierce deep into the heart. In fact, I have ripped this DVD into MP3 tracks, and listen to this recording almost as frequently as to the recording of ""Mlada"" made by E. Svetlanov in 1962. Both are indeed great! By the directors decision, some characters in this production have three incarnations - a singer, a dancer, and a doll. This also goes deep, it is very pleasing and symbolic. And, lastly, I, as Lithuanian, am also very fond that one of characteristic dances in this ballet-opera is performed by Lithuanian soldiers, where they dance imitating a fight.

So, despite flawed camera and montage work, this DVD and opera is a gem! Let us hope that opera and opera-movie art will return to its artistic roots, and this production will be the source of inspiration for other sensitive and music-loving directors.",1413936000,,1575,5.10077519379845
7840450,5,6303191622,"This is a great musical rendition of Rimsky-Korsakov's vision in the realm of fantasy and myth. Admittedly it is lengthy, but it is so full of riches that it is well worth watching it to the end, even if you do it in stages. The ""street vendor"" scene in act II for example is lively, and fun to watch. The Villainous Voislava is malificent and one can only anticipate her downfall (but her voice is great!) But the reason for this review is to highlight the wonderful characterization of the heroin, Mlada, by prima ballerina Nina Ananiashvili. For those who have admired her performances in e.g. Don Quixote and Swan Lake, her dancing here is a revelation. She shows a flexible, deeply feminine side of her acting skills not to be seen elsewhere. There are three such dancing sequences in the production. The most stunning is her rendition of the fantasy ""Cleopatra"" episode during which she, as the resurrected spirit of Cleopatra, attempts to lure the hero Yaromir away from his true love, Mlada. This sequence,in act III at about 1:35 from the start of the film, is by far worth the cost of the movie. Finally, a word should be said about the music. Much of it is Rimsky K. as you've never heard him before, particularly in the music for the Cleopatra episode. Top recommendation!",1366502400,,1284,4.6607929515418505
7840451,4,6303191622,"In order to understand Mlada it is important to realize that the original concept was for a pagan ballet. In 1832 Filippo Taglioni introduced the ballet La Sylphide. Henceforth the stories used for ballet would be based on folklore and fairytale. The plot of Mlada was adapted with a new time and place from The Shadow, a ballet by Filippo Taglioni in which the ghost of a murdered woman haunts her lover. The Shadow was premiered in 1839 in Saint Petersburg. The new project was conceived in 1870 by Stepan Gedeonov, director of the Imperial Theatres with music by Alexander Serov and choreography by Marius Petipe. However Serov died in 1871 without having composed anything for the work and Gedeonov revised his conception as an opera-ballet with a libretto by Victor Krylov. The story would be based on a subject borrowed from the Elba Slavs. In 1872 the leading Russian critic Vladimir Stasov, who was also responsible for the scenario to Borodin's Prince Igor, proposed collaboration of music for Mlada between four members of ""The Mighty Handful"". Cesar Cui as the most dramatic composer was allocated Act 1. Alexander Borodin was allocated Act 4 where dramatic moments would be blended with moments of elemental force. The first part of Act 2 and the second part of Act 3 were allocated to Modest Mussorgsky who wanted to use his St John's Night on Bare Mountain. The second part of Act 2 and the first part of Act 3 describing flight of shadows and appearance of Mlada were allocated to Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov. The incidental ballet music was allocated to Ludwig Minkus the official ballet composer of the Imperial Theatres. Although most of the music was completed, Gedeonov was dismissed from his post in 1875 as a result of court intrigues and the opera-ballet was never staged in this form. Marius Petipa staged a pure ballet version of Gedeonov's scenario for Mlada with music by Ludwig Minkus in 1879. In 1911 Cesar Cui edited and published Act 1 dedicating it to the memory of Borodin, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov. Borodin recycled some of his music into his Second Symphony. Rimsky-Korsakov edited and orchestrated the finale in 1892 as a separate concert piece. This was recorded by Loris Tjeknavorian with his set of Borodin symphonies on LP but so far it has not reappeared and no other conductor has taken it up. Rimsky-Korsakov and Mussorgsky recycled some of their music into other works. Mussorgsky rewrote his main work which had been inspired by Lizst's Todtentanz as Night on Bare Mountain and it was later edited and re-orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov. Mussorgsky also adapted the March of the Princes and Priests from Act 2 as Triumphal March- The Capture of Kars in 1880.  In his book My Musical Life Rimsky-Korsakov tells us that in 1889 on the second anniversary of Borodin's death he gathered with friends at Borodin's former apartment to spend a few hours in his memory. At this meeting Lyadov suggested that the subject matter of Mlada was a suitable one for Rimsky-Korsakov. This was agreed and Rimsky-Korsakov decided to start work on the opera-ballet immediately. He had recently become influenced by Wagner's Ring and by the use of leitmotifs. The composer used the original libretto with a few additions of his own, incorporating fragments which had not found their way into other works. So the declamatory style of Mussorgsky is suggested in the market scene beginning Act 2 and in the savage elements of Act 3. The constantly modulating Mlada theme at the end of Act 4 and which is used as a leitmotif in the other acts suggests Borodin. All the music is good with the music in Act 3 and the end of Act 4 being exceptional. Particularly fine in Act 3 are the superb demon's chorus and the Cleopatra scene.  Views on the DVD will depend on whether we are judging  the musical content or the theatrical one. Theatre critics are not noted for their musical appreciation. The singing, both solo and choral, stage sets, costuming, and conducting are mostly fine. The choreographing of the symphonic poem Night on Mount Triglav at the beginning of Act 3 seems unnecessary. In the following sequence leading tenor Oleg Kulka who plays Yaromir hits an extended top C sharp which is surely no mean feat. The symbology of dolls is not made clear and at times they seem to be inappropriate. The significance of the six musicians who appear on stage in baroque costume seems inexplicable. This sometimes spoils the decor as for example the otherwise superb Cleopatra sequence which is a visual marvel.  The costumes of different groups while generally appropriate are sometimes too similar so that it is not always clear who the different groups are. There are inappropriate close ups of stage action. This may be due to unfamiliarity by a western production and camera team. The main weakness seems to be an overall lack of coordination. An article on Rimsky-Korsakov as a composer of operas by Harlow Robinson which was available with the videocassette has unfortunately been omitted. A 1989 production on Videoland Klassic has better camera work although there are a few silly audience scenes. However the NVC Arts DVD has better quality picture and sound. For anyone interested in the music alone there is an excellent 1962 Melodiya recording conducted by Evgeny Svetlanov now available on CD.  Although Mlada was not a success with the critics at its first performance this was probably due to its unconventionality. As Rimsky-Korsakov tells in in his autobiography My Musical Life the view was: "" What under the sun have we to do with all these gods, spirits, devils? Let us have drama and drama, let us have living human beings!"" A lack of conviction by the production team still seems to be an impediment. As to why Rimsky-Korsakov's operas are not more frequently performed the most likely reason is the cost of mounting works with huge orchestras and choruses. I believe there was a project with Phillips to record all the operas but this seems to have fallen by the wayside.  In 1989 the American conductor Michael  Tilson-Thomas produced several works in concert at The Barbican under the title The Flight of the Firebird linking Mlada with Rimsky-Korsakov's opera of 1902 Kashchey the Deathless and Stravinsky's The Firebird. As a student of Rimsky-Korsakov,  Stravinsky was given  collections of folk songs which had been put together from ""The Mighty Handful"". Two folksongs from Rimsky-Korsakov's collection One Hundred Russian Folksongs of 1876 and one from Rimsky-Korsakov's Sinfonietta on Russian Themes Op 31 were used in The Firebird.  The original conception for Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring came from the Russian painter, archeologist, and mystic Nicholas Roerich. In 1910 Roerich wrote the story for a ballet that he entitled ""Supreme Sacrifice"". In a 1922 lecture Roerich stated that he had taken the subject from the life of pre-historic Slavs- which takes us back to Mlada. Despite Stravinsky's remarkable originality he again found the need to use folksongs, this time four from a collection of Lithuanian folksongs by Anton Juszkiewicz and at least one from Rimsky-Korsakov's Russian National Songs. Roerich is said to have found some material in Alexander Afanasyev's study of peasant folklore and pagan prehistory The Primary Chronicle, a 12th century chronicle of early pagan custom, and a book of poems by Sergei Gorodetsky.",1343779200,5,7395,5.0
7840452,4,6303191622,"It has ballet, singing, puppets and dolls.  It alternates between this world and the spirit world.  It even has a dance by Cleopatra brought back from the dead.  Spectacle substitutes for plot development.  These are all intrinsic weaknesses to this opera.  However, the Bolshi tackles all of these problems and has created a lavish production of this opera.  The music is wonderful.  The staging opulent.  The sound is fine.  As with other reviewers I was bothered by the image choices of the video director -- close ups of dancer's faces instead of whole body or feet is very bothersome.  This tendency was particularly pronounced during the folk dancing scenes -- in fact for some of the dances the continuity of the dance was lost.  Fortunately this tendency was kept in check during Nina Ananiashvili's solos -- to watch her dance is an amazing experience.  Her solo at the end of act one is worth the cost of the entire DVD.",1300752000,,930,4.74375

7840454,4,6303191622,"This is great music well performed and if, as for me, the opera was new to you, the DVD will help you to make sense of the action. But the staging is often distracting. So I no longer watch, only listen.",1180828800,6,203,3.975609756097561
7840455,3,6303191622,"Yes, the camera work is frustrating, but with so many singers and dancers on stage, the only unobstructed sightlines might be from the Goodyear blimp.  I think there is also a conceptual problem with the work of art.  The prima ballerina who doesn't sing and the tenor who doesn't dance are not only separated by death but by artistic genre. This is not a match made in heaven.  (But I'll use chapter selection to enjoy Ananiashvili's Cleopatra dance.)",1138579200,15,452,4.769230769230769
