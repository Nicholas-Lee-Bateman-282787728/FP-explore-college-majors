Its bad luck for the dud playing the lead role , but carter wong cannot be put second . The first part shows the maze and the training , the second is full of suprises , some that are cheesy and not needed. I felt the second part , where they leave the temple is where it starts to go a bit down .....

but buy this movie the action is worth your money...",1148774400,,469,4.043010752688172
8250981,5,B000062XFP,"Oh, if only Carter Wong acted in movies today and thereby completely shutting down the over hyped over stlylized psuedo-hip crappile out these days!  Unmatched intensity and inexahaustible passion was Ka Tat (carter Wong) stlye.  He truly delivers in this, the first of an unofficial trilogy ending with a stunning ""The Blazing Temple"", directed all by Joseph Kuo, who had an interest in James Bond films as well.  The bronzemen are an invention after the gold-dipped girl in ""Goldfinger"".  Here though, they are given life by some hard hitting action packed Shaolin kung fu.  The dvd also does justice to the original film's presentation and the back story of the young exiles seeking training and eventual revenge on the conniving enemy of Manchu.  There are the sub-plots that bring life to the action and round out the film well, setting up for the classic great climax.  The only problem with the feature is the subtitles, that at times are unclear and poorly translated.  Though it is an old kung fu flick, so, many of us have gotten used to witnessing the injustice done to the chinese cinema: awful english dubbed dialogue, terrible american editing, and skewed up subtitles (to name a few).  Of course, we sit through this patiently and truly enjoy a good exiciting original action film.",1035936000,4,1296,4.908256880733945
