I own maybe 10 Artsmagic Play Series DVD's and I plan on continuing my collection. Arts magic Play series is a great learning tool for guitarists looking to flesh out their playing style. I expect nothing but the same level of quality from this DVD and I can't wait to sink my teeth into it and obsorb all the useful information and technique it has available! I'm very excited and can't wait!",1458604800,,561,4.446601941747573
