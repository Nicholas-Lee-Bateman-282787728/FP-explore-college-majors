I have been using The Firm  workout series for 10 years, and The Tortoise and Hare series is my  favorite.  Using the two videos together, I get a whole body workout that  burns fat and keeps me toned.  I wouldn't trade these two tapes for  anything.",962755200,8,374,4.242857142857143
7869627,4,6304396023,I have quite a few firm tapes and I like this one ok. there is alot of dance steps incorporated here- not something I'm crazy about. I found myself getting a little impatient getting through all the dance step parts but if you like that sort of thing in your workout you will enjoy this.,1370563200,,287,4.236363636363636
7869628,2,6304396023,"I have many FIRM Videos, but was wanting a new routine.
This particular video is slow, boring and despite what others
have written, it was WAY too easy.  I'm an avid exerciser &
would consider myself fit, but not at the elite level.
If you like slower tempo and easier workouts, this will
work for you. Otherwise, SKIP IT!!",1303084800,,323,4.47457627118644
7869629,5,6304396023,"This is a great workout. It is a Firm Cross Trainer classic. The Hare is meant to be alternated with the Tortoise workout. The Hare workout uses lighter weights with faster moves. The Tortoise uses heavier weights in the workout. I have so much fun doing this video I forget I am working out. Tracie Long leads both the Tortoise and the Hare workouts. On the Hare workout she goes through fun floor aerobics using light dumbells. The ballroom step aerobics are really fun. They were a little tricky to learn at first,but once you`ve mastered the moves,they are so much fun. She goes trough a lot of different dance steps,the Swing,the Tango,The Cha Cha,etc. Tracie Long goes through steps very well. I learned them fast. She also goes through effective floor work using ankle weights. The abdominal sections are very effective as well. This is a great total body workout. Any person who loves to workout need to try this workout.",1154563200,,929,4.7407407407407405
7869630,5,6304396023,"The Hare and The Tortoise are my 2 favorite videos by The Firm.  Actually, they are my favorite of all of my tapes.  Get them, you will love the workout and results!",1138924800,,165,4.125
7869631,5,6304396023,I love this tape.  I recently tried a non-Firm tape that advertised easy to follow ballroom dance steps - and I was totally lost.  This didn't happen with The Hare.  The steps are indeed easy to follow - the combinations aren't difficult at all - and I always feel like I've gotten a thorough workout without the total exhaustion I get from some of the other videos.  Highly recommended!,1046736000,,387,4.565217391304348
7869632,5,6304396023,"For those of you new to the FIRM workouts I start out by saying it is hard to go wrong with a FIRM tape. These tapes are for serious exercisers and deliver the results they promise.
This particular work-out is one of the later work-outs in the FIRM series. It is part of a cross-trainer set and is best used in conjunction with the TORTOISE workout. These are meant to complement each other - the Hare emphasises fast moves with light weights and the Tortoise emphasises slow moves with heavy weights (Women - don't worry, you WON'T bulk up doing any of these, you will just gain beautiful muscle definition and a toned look). The Tortoise and Hare are designed to be done on alternate days to give your body maximal cardio and strength benefits. But they are excellent work-outs on their own as well.
The Hare, being one of the later tapes has great cueing from Tracy long and very safe moves. The work-out is about an hour long and is done to an unusual choice of ball-room music in the background. You will exercise to a tango, cha cha and others. This is NOT a tape for learning these dances. The music is just for different variety from the usual jazzy music found on work-out tapes. If you do not like classic ballroom music, this tape may not be the best for you - although it is still a great work-out. You may want to try the FIRM Cardio and Strength cross trainers instead.
You will need some equipement for this work-out. A set of dumbells (it is good to have at least 2 sets - 3 and 5 pounds for beginning women) and two step boxes (or one with an adjustable height). The heights that work best for the step boxes are 4 inches for the short one and 10-14 inches for the tall box. Once you have the necessary equipment you are ready to go.
Tracy is a great instructor and the moves are not hard to follow. After the first couple of times you will be able to do them effortlessly and have lots of fun. You will work your entire body in the hour and also maintain a good heart rate for cardio.
This work-out can be quite tough and is good enough for intermediate to advanced exercisers. It is however also a GREAT work-out for beginners who want to get more serious about their fitness level and want to advance. Beginners can do this workout without weights and pausing and resting as needed. They will quickly advance to the next level, and the results will be much better than those you will see from typical ""beginners"" work-outs. This tape is easier to do than the classic FIRMS (volume 1 through 6) and is therefore a better choice for beginners who want to advance to ""serious FIRMS"".
All in all, I would rate this work-out a perfect ten. Very well researched, brilliantly executed - a classic. But note that you may not like it if you hate ballroom music, if you dislike ""serious"" instructors who are not enthusiastic balls of energy but rather calm and professional, or if you simply faint at the idea of exercising for a full hour.
For serious results though, this is an excellent choice.",1024963200,61,3007,4.4198198198198195
7869633,5,6304396023,"I really enjoy this video.  I own about 20 Firm tapes, and I find myself reaching for this one again and again.  I really have fun doing the ballroom aerobics, and I when I am done, I feel GREAT!  I think you would not be disapointed with this tape.",1013299200,7,249,4.040816326530612
7869634,5,6304396023,"I love to do this workout! However, I thought that it is really hard to do the ballroom aerobics without a short box. Anyway, the best section is the floor workout because it really targets those hard to tone areas.",977961600,5,215,4.4
7869635,5,6304396023,"Whenever I have one of those days when I don't feel like doing anything, I reach for this workout.  I would say it's one of my favorite.  It begins  with a warmup and great stretch (one of the Firm's best).  Then it goes  into about 30 min of what the Firm calls ""ballroom aerobics.""  Don't be put off by that title, because I'm about as  choreography-challenged as possible, but I was able to master many of the  moves by the second time I did the tape.  Some of the aerobics are on the  floor using hand weights, and some are using a short (I use a 4"")  step.  There are also two tall box (12-14"") sections.  Then there is a  tricep muscle building with weights small section and the rest of the  action is on the floor.  This video has some of the best lower body work  from the Firm including table work, adductor and abductor work, and bridge  work.  This floor work really gets your lower body in fantastic shape.  I  cannot recommend this video enough if you are looking for something fun and  different that really helps to get you into great shape.",966556800,23,1057,4.312820512820513
7869636,4,6304396023,"I have followed the Firm workout series for the past 3 years and this is  by far one of the most effective videos I have used.  Using a combination  of ballroom step aerobics with light conditioning you will definitely feel  the effects of this workout the next day.  It also includes an ab training  session that will have your stomach feeling more toned and tight in just a  couple of weeks.  It is definitely one of the best total body workouts the  FIRM offers, and is best when used in conjunction with the tortoise  workout.",962755200,6,530,4.484210526315789
