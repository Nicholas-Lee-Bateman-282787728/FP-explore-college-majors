8622474,4,B00GEC3QUE,"I was surprised, I know it's pictured, but I didn't really expect to receive the bands with the DVD.  There are two included:  a pink light tension band and a green medium tension band.

Leslie is all by herself in this one, no background people.  She's perky as always, but she sometimes overdoes the perkiness when with a group of walkers.  I did all five miles, but you can pick from the menu as to how much you want to do.  She uses the band sporadically, and to be honest I don't like Leslie's toning work, so there wasn't too much of it for my taste (and she keeps moving the whole time, it's just upper body band work).  She doesn't count evenly on each side which makes me crazy, so I just kept walking!

She also does more than the four basic moves, which I always appreciate (tap-outs, kickbacks, heels, 1-2-3 and tap...) it helps keep me from getting bored.  There's also a mini all band workout on the menu that's around 5 minutes long.",1527811200,,948,4.340909090909091
