2518612,5,B000EGZ4XS,"When we were looking for a way to lie out right to our children and keep them in the dark about the actual workings of life on Earth, this was the perfect video for us. With fun characters and great music, we were able to indoctrinate our children into a way of thinking that should have gone away in the bronze age. If you want your kids to believe in fairy tales and hocus pocus with no factual basis whatsoever, this is the best place to start!",1366502400,155,447,4.149425287356322
2518613,5,B000EGZ4XS,"I saw this video 6 or 7 years ago and still remember it.  I wish I had seen it when I was young: Even as an adult, I loved it and learned SO much from watching it.  I am now looking to purchase it as a gift for a young family we know.  It is informative and fun!",1364947200,9,262,3.4827586206896552
2518614,5,B000EGZ4XS,"Ken Ham has his series answers and this is for kids, very intuitive and my son understands, at least to a small comprehension level of what the Bible is about.  But again that take active instruction from the parents as well.",1357084800,6,225,4.487804878048781
2518615,1,B000EGZ4XS,Biblically spot on but it was boring. It was bad quality and like sitting in a lecture. My kids were not thrilled,1348185600,4,113,4.181818181818182
2518616,3,B000EGZ4XS,"I agree with all the information presented in the DVD (God created the dinosaurs along with all the other animals during creation, dinos were on the ark, fossils are the result of the flood, & medieval ""dragons"" were probably dinos).  However, most of the DVD time consists of Ken Ham lecturing.  He's standing behind a podium with children sitting quietly in rows listening to him.  He has a white board behind him.  From the cover of the DVD with the fun dinosaur cartoon you'd think this would be geared toward young children.  I think it was created for children by people who don't have young children.  This was boring even for me let alone for my creation-theory-dinosaur-loving 7, 4, & 2 year olds. 5 stars for content.  1.5 stars for presentation.",1278547200,12,756,4.7251908396946565
2518617,5,B000EGZ4XS,"I hope you will give this video an opportunity, and please don't base your decision on one negative review.  I totally disagree with the other negative review and wanted to come on to share our impression and experience with it.

We think the video is wonderful, and it is very effective with children. Part of the reasons why are the little bits of humor added in with the IMPORTANT truthes that are communicated.

It is in a lecture type setting and so I think that they did a wonderful job of making that fun for children, with animated graphics on the screen, a game you play along for the viewers watching to help them pay attention and retain the information, songs and dances and props.  It is not a boring lecture as a result of these creative additions.

The speaker is renowned and famous in the Christian Community, and that is for good reason.  It is so sad how the lie of evolution has saturated our world to such an extent, that the truth about how Dinosaurs were created (by an Almighty Creator - God) and the truth about how they were destroyed, are not common knowledge in comparison to the lies of evolution.  That is what makes this speaker SO renowned, and what makes this video so important and special.  There is science offered to back up the information in the video, and biblical truth is presented.

There is also another Creation/Christian Dinosaur video out there that is marvelous and even more entertaining that this one called ""T.R.U.T.H about Dinosaurs"".  That one is even more entertaining, but this one offered a lot more factual information (still in a fun way for kids) with a lot more information to help you understand and that supports the truth about Dinosaurs.

Hope that helps.  I wanted to write it because sometimes we can be misled by one negative review, so please decide for yourself ... in a world SO full of lies about dinosaurs and evolution, it is worth finding those ""diamonds in the ruff"" and this video is one of them.  If your kids walk into any bookstore and pick up every book off the shelf about Dinosaurs, most likely every book will say ""millions of years ago"" and ""evolution"" ... video's like this are the few gems that tell the TRUTH.  God created Dinosaurs and they lived on earth with man prior to the flood in the days of Noah.  Science backs this up!

Blessings to you in your search for truth :)",1263859200,18,2362,4.548463356973995
2518618,5,B000EGZ4XS,"I love this DVD and am glad I bought it.  I only wish I had more of these highly entertaining shows.  My children love watching them, and I am grateful to Ken Ham and Buddy Davis for creating this video and explaining how dinosaurs and the bible fit together.

This helpful DVD has cute, easy-to-follow songs and shows how dinosaurs point to creationism rather than prove evolution.

So what about dinosaurs?  And how do they fit in with the bible?  And were they actually on the ark?  What about all those fossils?  This great DVD answers all those questions and more.",1240358400,8,569,4.564356435643564
2518619,1,B000EGZ4XS,"I asked my parents to buy this for my son for his 6th birthday.  I watched it first (with spouse), of course.  Please, for the sake of your children and their sponge-like minds -- DO NOT BUY THIS!

At first, I thought this was ""kinda cute"" and entertaining.  But the ""used car salesman pitch"" was ringing loud and clear throughout.  This man talks so quickly (yes, it's a lecture-style video) it's difficult for small children to keep up.  But that was not the worst part. Two of the main reasons I am giving this only 1-star is because of the lies and the ""dance"" he does to cover over something he just doesn't have an answer for.  Let me explain....
1. - the lies -- one example is when he is speaking of dragons.  Were they real? he says yes, and they still live here on earth -- let my friend show you.  This burly man walks out on stage and has a lighter (or some sort of small torch) hidden in his hand with a small lizard.  He proceeds to remove the cloak from the lizard and shoots this fire from his ""hidden lighter"" just behind the mouth of the lizard.  Come on!  Thank goodness, my children didn't believe one shred of this video!
2. If he doesn't have a ""good answer"" he simply repeats this annoying jingle ""it's designed to do what it does do,.........."".

I am a Christian.  I believe in Creation whole-heartedly.  I don't believe in the ""young world theory"" at all at this point.  I have been told that Ken is a world-renown speaker and very much praised by the Christian community. Hmmmm....I truly wonder why.  I will never purchase another product authored by this man.

At the end of the DVD series, I learned that not only I had many more questions, but my son was even more confused.  Not my intensions.

I do have to say, the Noah's Ark portion of this series was good (for children).  But hardly worth the money for a 5-minute segment.

With regard to the songs (another reviewer raved about them) all of my children 16 mo., 4 years, 6 years found them annoying -- so much that they asked me to fast-forward through the singing.",1182211200,26,2052,4.373015873015873
2518620,5,B000EGZ4XS,"I bought this when my daughter was three and she didn't understand all that the speaker had to say, but she loved the songs. She asked us to play it a lot last summer. I put it away for the winter and got it out this spring as my daughter just turned 4 and she understands most of the message and plays and sings the songs over and over and over. My one year old was actually captivated by the songs. Both my daughters have sat through and listened to the entire message. At their ages I'm not sure how much they understand, but they both seem to really enjoy both the DVD's.",1147478400,11,575,4.097345132743363
8109584,1,B000EGZ4XS,"Absolute pile of dinopoop.  Dinosaurs did NOT EVER roam the Earth with humans.  Ham is NOT a scientist and knows absolutely ZERO about dinosaurs or anything else that happened before 10,000BC precisely because he doesn't BELIEVE in facts.  If you want your kids to grow up looking real stupid, feed them this drivel.  Even if you are Christian, PLEASE read any of the zillions of science texts that actually base their content on proven fact.  And don't believe the ""it's just a theory"" BS.  Gravity is also a ""theory"" which you would know if you read a science book.  Kirk out.",1486944000,3,578,4.663366336633663

8109589,5,B000EGZ4XS,"If you're like me and completely disregard what Darwin has put his life to and scientists in the 100+ years after him have done, then this is for you! Hundreds of thousands of peer-reviewed, evidenced based studies? As if, I completely disregard what has been cemented as fact both logically and scientifically and I hope you do the same! I really hope to see more from this company. Maybe they'll make something like Climate Change: The Earth is Actually Getting Cooler and The Big Bang Theory: Light is Just a Ruse, or what I really hope for: The Lie of Gravity and Why It Is Just a Theory. Never have I enjoyed disregarding science more, and I am eager to see more works that disregard logical evidence from Ken Ham and Company.",1398816000,3,731,4.545454545454546
8109590,5,B000EGZ4XS,"This DVD is one of the best I've ever seen. I've given many for gifts they're so well done. If your kids or grandkids have questions about dinosaurs based on the Biblical account, this is the DVD for them! It's a fun DVD to watch with them.",1382918400,15,240,4.127659574468085
8109591,5,B000EGZ4XS,"After my child returned home from a playdate with a Jewish child, I saw that he had a plastic dinosaur and heard him talking about how this creepy monster had lived ""a long time ago, like a gajillion years!""  In my household there is only one punishment for such basphemes against the lord:  spanking.  But no matter how much I spanked, paddled and punished, there was no stopping the talk of evolution and millions of years.  Then I discovered Ken's book.  After a few readings, my child was accepting the one true explanation for how the world came to be:  that God created it all over the course of six days some six thousand years ago, and that thorns and poisonous fangs did not appear until after the Fall (when creatures were punished for the sins committed by Adam and Eve by the hand of God in the ultimate act of Justice).  Thanks to this book, my paddling hand can get some rest!",1366588800,11,890,4.423312883435583
8109592,1,B000EGZ4XS,"There is faith, and there is science.  They are not mutually exclusive since science requires faith in our senses and our view of reality.  One can still believe in evolution and science and also believe in God and Jesus.

However, faith and science are NOT interchangeable.  God gave us the ability to think and use our senses to make sense of the world He created for us.  If proven nuclear dating methods tell us that dinosaur remnants predate humans, we must believe that; not to believe it is insanity, like saying the sun is out when it's raining.

At the same time, religious beliefs are not scientifically testable or provable, which is fine with scientists.  Scientists don't care about the reasons for things - they just analyze them.  No scientist can tell me Jesus did not exist.  He did, period.  No one disputes this.  Whether he is the Son of God is not scientifically provable at this point, but it is as true to me as seeing the sun rise every day even though I know science can't prove it.

The bottom line is - DON'T SUBJECT YOUR CHILDREN TO THIS MATERIAL.  You aren't doing them any favors.  Let them see faith for what it is and the material world for what it is.  In this way you are doing your children, God and the rest of us a huge kindness.",1366502400,57,1266,4.41991341991342
8109593,5,B000EGZ4XS,". . . If what you're thinking of is raising ignoramuses and outcasts who will never be able to make their way in life. Because the first time your child pops off with some of the nonsensical 'wisdom' in this crackpot DVD, he or she will be shunned by all the other kids.

Even if you home-school them, at some point your children are going to have to live in the real world. The many untruths in this very silly and very embarrassing piece of idiocy are the sort of things that stick in a child's mind - and come out at the most unfortunate times, like during a job interview, on a college application, or when talking to the parents of the person your child one day hopes to marry.

So, if your fondest wish is to risk ruining your child's life, by all means expose them to this mindless twaddle.",1366502400,85,797,4.2368421052631575
