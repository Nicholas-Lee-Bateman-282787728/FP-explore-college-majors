8240641,5,B00115R2VI,This is a must have off-road video. Such classic Baja action. Makes me realize how much I miss the Mark Post battles with all the top contenders of the day...and what an sweet looking Trophy Truck!  Nothing like watching the Trucks and Class Ones flying down Zoo Road with the suspension sucking up the miles and miles of unrelenting whoops!  Let's not forget the frighteningly daring Mexican spectators that line Zoo Road getting in on the action as the race cars fly through.,1336608000,,477,4.734939759036145
