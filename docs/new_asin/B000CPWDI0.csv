8200726,5,B000CPWDI0,"""Rock'n Roll Revolution"" is the first live DVD release by Norwegian glam metal band ""Wig Wam"" in 2005. The package is a 2DVD set, one disc featuring the band's 2005 tour documentary and promo videos while the second disc is an amazing 16-track show of the band in their home-country.

The live DVD for that matter is an arena show, featuring ""Wig Wam"" live with the support of a full orchestra delivering what they credit as ""Wig Wam Symphonic"" and it is indeed an outstanding show, exemplary captured in both sight and sound on both stereo and 5.1. surround sound. And to think that this incredible production was merely in support of their debut album ""Hard to be a rock'n roller"", one has to congratulate the band for going the distance to deliver the biggest possible rock production.

In terms of performance you can expect ""Wig Wam"" matching the accomplishment of the studio versions. In particular Age Sten Nilsen vocally hits any note with admirable precision, being high pitched, mid or bass range while delivering endless stage theatrics throughout the show. Guitarist Trond Holter holds nothing of his melodic shredding back, reaching the very definition of melodic hard rock guitarist while the rhythm section of bassist Bernt Jansen and drummer Oystein Andersen is just as precise and flamboyant as ever. Needless to say the songs are ideal slices of melodic hard rock/glam metal (as one would expect having experienced their debut album) that work perfectly with the support of the orchestra.

Overall ""Wig Wam-Rock'n'roll"" revolution is considered a must for any fan of glam metal, melodic hard rock or arena rock. ""Wig Wam"" indeed released the ultimate DVD for a newcomer act that ultimately proves their commitment in hard rock.",1302393600,,1745,5.010344827586207
8200727,5,B000CPWDI0,"These guys are terrific! One of my favourite bands has released a DVD! Not just one DVD, but a double DVD. Rock'n Roll Revolution 2005 includes the entire concert Wig Wam Symphonic where the band teamed up with stfold symphony orchestra and a men's choir to give 75 minutes of entertaining rock music. The concert took place in Mysen which is my hometown, and yes, I was at the concert, so you might catch a glimpse of me out in the crowd along with about 7.000 people of all ages had shown up to to see their favourites. Here you get the entire concert in surround sound! Not only that, you also get an extra DVD with documentaries about the band(funny stuff!!!) and 6 music videos and live performances from Eurovision song contest and other TV performances.
