3674575,3,B000ENC7PY,"There are 8 chapters to this film, personally I don't think this film is worth buying but decide that for yourself:

-Gravel Crew: the footage is mediocre, camera angles could be better, the interviews are fun and it's nice to see their enthusiasm. Gives a little break down of the driver and ""pit"" crew's jobs when racing along with the challenges of each track/ road course. (This section of the documentary follows a small team of Subaru's).
-The Drifters: good areal footage of drift competitions and practice sessions plus personal interviews with Team Falcon and Team Symphonic professional drifters. Examines a little bit of the popularity of drifting since its start in Japan, as well as what it demands from the driver. (This section of the film follows more 240s and RX7s).
-Mini Racers: this follows a weekly Mini enthusiasts car meet with a couple of interviews from its members. Again, the footage isn't bad but it isn't great despite some areal and side street angles. The interviews further break down the demands of driving, especially driving on public roads.
-Rim of the World: The footage is mainly on a crappy night camera and examines the technical aspect of when to break and accelerate when racing. The rest is more interviews with the Gravel Crew (This section of the film follows the small team of Subaru's from the beginning of the film, as well as VWs and beaters).
-Drift Line: Shows photos of a 2003 Drift crash in the RX7 as well as a bunch of drifters going to a go kart track to refine their skills.
-M7 Tuning: Follows the testing and development of new products from M7 Tuning that plays part in racing the canyons in California.
-Tombstone: Here the Gravel Crew is shadowed at a local event so they can practice and work on their lap times, this includes footage of a DSM and Honda.
-Formula D: This section takes you to the top drift competition where footage is recorded to keep track of personal skill levels as well as scouting based on the skills of other drivers. Scores are measured based on the speed of the entry and exit of drift turns as well as how long drivers are able to drift through corners. This is probably the best footage of the whole film as it gives multiple angles from inside of the car, the front and back dash views and outside angles.

Overall, the documentary is okay, nothing really special; the narration is boring and kind of monotone. Basically I'm still searching for movies like this to keep my thrill going once Speed/ Fox 1 isn't showing any races.",1384214400,2,2520,4.673423423423423
3674576,2,B000ENC7PY,"Boring and crappy.  Now you flip a coin to decide which is most appropriate.  I guess I've been spoiled by the excellent, and no doubt expensive, production quality of Best Motoring and Hot Version videos.  This DVD did not meet those standards.  Nor did it live up to the slick cover art.  Perhaps I was just expecting something different.  What, though, I'm not sure; more camera angles and more exciting content, but this video just delivered none of that.  The interviews were way more low key than I would expect, but I suppose they're realistic when you consider that the guys featured are trying to get their big break into racing.  That, I guess, makes it a very serious pursuit for them.  Unlike the Best Motornig drivers who have all had some level of success on the professional racing circuits.  If you want a peek into the lives of some up-and-coming drivers and how they practice/train, this DVD may be the ticket.  But if you want to be entertained, it didn't do it for me.  I didn't like it.  ""Hate"", however, is a strong word... and I've already used it once today.",1227657600,2,1082,4.572916666666667
3674577,4,B000ENC7PY,"While the information provided was a little hazy, and the video quality didn't quite match up with the professional looking cover, this is a must buy for any fan of mountain roads.",1191196800,,180,4.65625
3674578,4,B000ENC7PY,"Admittedly, after watching Chasing the Touge for the first time I planned to get on here and give it a considerably bad review. After watching it I couldn't get scenes of dark, grainy, vibrating footage and boring interviews out of my head! The excessive attention to drifting and the fact that the end credits roll at 48 minutes (a far cry from the Amazon listed 90 minute run time) lead me to investigate [...] (a site I frequent and trust) claim that Chasing the Touge may end up being seen as a ""classic"" amongst automotive enthusiasts. I read their impressions of the video and started to realize that maybe I didn't give it enough attention and wasn't remembering the great things about it. I watched the feature again and found myself surprisingly enticed! Already being familiar with the pace, in my second viewing I realized that there isn't really a strong emphasis on drifting. In fact it's quite well balanced and overall the combination of footage and interviews is rather interesting and certainly informative with a nicely revealing look into the lifestyles of these people. Most of the footage is rather good considering the conditions they drive under and the documentary style of the video is a fresh change from inferior automotive lifestyle DVDs such as Grip Video. Along with a few fairly decent bonus features (hey, most videos like this don't have bonus features), Chasing the Touge is a worthy purchase. Though not of the quality of something like Best Motoring, it should be a nice addition to your automotive DVD library.",1174089600,3,1547,4.885931558935361
8316564,4,B000ENC7PY,"This profiles crazy/unwise guys who race around on California Valley Roads at 3:00 AM in an effort to avoid law enforcement and civilians. I would recommend sticking to the arcade game 'outrun', with a wreck, the car just jumps back onto the screen. Some camera following. They also go to racetracks and drive there which is much safer, includes interviews.

The extras includes a visit to manufacturers car show which features girls (!) and then some informative data about car building which is pretty insightful. The extras get this to 4 stars, the main portion itself is...dangerous!",1480377600,,587,5.051546391752577

8316566,1,B000ENC7PY,"Snooze fest. Watch this if you're trying to go to sleep. No demonstrations of driving skill. I could watch a 5 minute video on YouTube and be more captivated. I don't remember a story. I'd rather watch ""SuperFast"" the Fast & Furious parody and, I hate that movie!!",1469232000,,264,4.520833333333333

8316568,2,B000ENC7PY,"Interesting premise, but too many shots of talking heads and not enough of cars going fast.  There were few details on the what, if any, modifications were done.
