1866745,5,B00008Y47T,"We have a 2,3 and 4 year old and they all love the orginal which of course we have seen 1,000 times.
for valentines we took all 3 to dinner and then to the show - they (and most of the other kids in the theatre) were dancing in the aisles for most of the movie.
It may not have been as good as the orginal - but it was still very good especially for younger kids",1045353600,,362,3.7142857142857144
1866746,3,B00008Y47T,"When I wrote these lines, there were 4 reviews on Amazon.com. None of the reviewers seemed to have seen the movie. - Well, I have seen it with my 2 1/2 year old son. I also know Disney's first Jungle Book movie. Now here is what I think:
This movie is fine for kids. They will have fun. There are no scenes that I think are too scary for small children. My son was doing fine. He enjoyed the song and dance scenes a lot and I think this is why most people like the first movie. Since the ""Bear Necessities"" is such a great song, it is played about three times (make your own thoughts about that). So, if you want your kids to have a good day at the movies, send them to this one.
From an adult point of view I must say that the story is not very exciting. Don't forget, this is a Disney sequel again. Disney used to release their sequels only on video and DVD (e.g. Pocahontas 2, Arielle 2, etc.). But lately they think that they should show them in movie theaters. It's too bad that Disney tries to warm up successful stories. If you don't have kids that you want to take to the movies, don't watch this one unless you go into the theater not expecting too much. The movie is not bad but it's just not as great as the guys at Disney think it should be.
My top 3 Disney animated movies are:
1. Aladdin (just fabulous!!!!!)
2. The Beauty and the Beast
3. The Little Mermaid
(This list does not include the computer animated movies, of course.)",1045180800,32,1442,4.1535714285714285
1866747,5,B00008Y47T,The first Jungle Book was wonderful and classical. Though I have yet to see the second I'm sure it will be highly enjoyable. There is alot of negativity about Part 2. I think it is unfair that people dismiss or criticise what they have yet to see. Part 2 explores Mogley's other side which was inevitable. It may not be as action packed as the first but I'm sure it will still be good. One must keep in mind that it is a different type of movie. One must also remember that this movie is mainly yo entertain or children and grandchildren not us adults.,1045008000,,552,4.266666666666667
1866748,3,B00008Y47T,I watched the trailer for this and it looks okay but not as as good as 2002's Return to Neverland I'm a Disney fan and I love disney movies but this one looks kinda corny it may be okay if you were 7 or 6 yrs. old but this looks kind of kiddish!!!,1044921600,,247,3.6792452830188678
1866749,5,B00008Y47T,"I live in Tanzania, East Africa.  I saw Jungle Book 1 in Drive In Cinema and it was wonderful night some 15 years ago.  The beauty was ehnanced further as Tanzania has lot of Jungle and the practically all scenes seen in the Movie, Including night scenes with moon shining over lake / River are in Real Life here.
The Jungle Book 2 will take those things many steps further and it is a film worth watching over and over again.  I think that DVD is the best thing ...",1042675200,2,466,4.155555555555556

They couldn't include King Louie for legal reasons.  And for reasons that make no sense, they took great pains to have Jim Cummings imitate the original characters voices, yet thought to hire John Goodman to replace Phil Harris' voice as Baloo.  John Goodman is no Phil Harris.

On every level, this movie is redundant.  (They even thought to do a third version of the same; fortunately, someone with sense nixed that idea.)",1418083200,,554,4.913978494623656

1866853,5,B00008Y47T,"John Goodman may not be Phil Harris, but he's darn close. Goodman makes a very convincing Baloo Bear. This film was made 34 years after the first Jungle Book which makes it more surprising in it's continuity. The actor Jim Cummings can perfectly reproduce the voice of character actor Sterling Holloway, who voiced Kaa in the 1967 Jungle Book film. Technology has advanced in animation since 1967, allowing for shading of characters, but you could watch the two films back to back and have great continuity.",1397692800,,507,4.906976744186046

The voice cast was also fantastic! I'm glad that Tony Jay got to voice Shere Khan (very close to George Sander's voice). My favorite character in this movie has to be Ranjan. He is just a crack up. Now some people would find new characters in a sequel to be awful or annoying (which I can agree), but this Ranjan character is delightful.

First of all, the voice acting will get annoying for purists. The actor they got to play Baloo doesn't match with Phil Harris at all. But on the plus side, Haley Joel Osment does a great job as Mowgli, and the character, while being intensely annoying in the original, has become more mature, and is a more likeable character. The film also has the addition of Shanti, the girl that lured Mowgli into the village and Ranjan, a little kid who looks up to Mowgli. It's overall a pretty good but pointless film. Worth maybe one or two watches, and kids will definitely not mind it. It's not really boring, it's just not needed after the first movie.",1351036800,,803,4.36

This direct-to-video sequel the Walt Disney Pictures' 1967 classic hit based on The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling is a real hoot...literally. The casting is brilliant, from Haley Joel Osment (""The Sixth Sense,"" ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"") to the late Tony Jay (Monsieur D'Arque in ""Beauty And The Beast,"" ""The Hunchback Of Notre Dame""). I really like the relationship between Shanti and Ranjan. So sweet, as most older sister/younger brother relationships are often depicted so negatively, with too much hate and no love. Then again, I'm an only child, so I can only imagine what it would be like to have an older sibling, preferably a sister. (But I digress). This is truly a first-rate sequel to its predecessor, like Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 & Pocahontas II: Journey To A New World. My only complaint is that this film is too short, at 72 minutes.

I purchased the original film on DVD earlier in the week for her and she watched it three or four times (yes, she spends lots of time out-of-doors).  My wife is stuck in England due to the Icelandic volcano that grounded all aircraft.  I was kind of bummed out earlier today and went to Best Buy to look for CD bargains (came out with The Clash - London Calling).  Anyway, I spotted this sequel and vaguely recalled the theatrical release some years earlier.  I decided that buying my grand-daughter a little something was surely a way to brighten spirits stateside.  I was not wrong.  We loved it.  No, it isn't has wonderful as Jungle Book (original).  How could it possibly be expected to be as wonderful - Most of the cast from the original are long dead.  Somehow, with the exception of King Louie (a character which, by the way, has nothing to do with racial stereotyping), they managed to get the voices very close.  The story is a little more contrived that the original.  However, from a skeptic (I try to stay away from sequels that are not planned in the original story arc) and a big fan of the first film, this was pretty darn good, we loved it - and I'm sure I'm going to get to love it over and over again for some time to come!",1271548800,,1470,4.321167883211679

I especially enjoyed the songs but now forget which was my favorite.  The snake was still the villain plus the tiger which, I think, would scare small sensitive children.  Seeing some Harry Potter early movies on t.v., some of those meanies would scare a child more than these animated songsters.  Brett and Crissy were taken to see every one of them, but I wondered how she sat through some of the hard-core violence.

1866911,3,B00008Y47T,"Not exactly a ""bare necessity"" for a movie collection here.  I just watched this and what I saw was the stark difference between what Disney animation was in the 1960's (The Original Jungle Book; Robin Hood; Original Fox and Hound; The Aristocats) and what it has recently become.

It took me a while to grasp what looks wrong about this movie, and what it is seems to be that it looks like multiple ways of rendering art are superimposed in a way that doesn't integrate them very well.  The original Jungle Book looks like an oil painting (to quote one of the creators of this movie from the special features) but this movie looks like some inordinately brightly colored and rather flat dimensionless matte artwork with a combination of animated drawings and computer generated 3D animation.

Or to put it briefly, a group of computer people got together and threw together several different ways of creating images, way over did it, and then congratulated themselves for being great artists.  Oh, and while they were at it they forgot to come up with a story.  A real story would have helped.

One good thing this movie has going for it is the voice acting talent.  It really sounded like the original Jungle Book, even if it looked very different.

So the bottom line is by all means try to see this movie before you shell out the money and reserve precious shelf space for this rehash of a beloved Disney classic.",1247961600,,1417,4.636

Soon enough Mowgli is after her and they meet up. Shere Khan is nearby and comes out of hiding. It's near the end and Mowgli is at this broken down ""palace-looking"" place, alone with Shere Khan. Baloo and the child run together, following Shanti, as she too arrives.

After a while of taking turns playing on the gongs to confuse Shere, they eventually meet him face to face. But you know how these Disney movies end. In a happy place. If you haven't seen the movie:

1. You didn't miss that much.
2. If you saw the first, then you might as well watch part 2.

1866927,4,B00008Y47T,"Note: The review that follows is of the Special Edition of a film first released in 2003.

Comparisons with the earlier version released 41 years ago (featuring the voices of Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, George Sanders, and Sterling Holloway among others) are inevitable and perhaps unfair. As I began to watch this sequel, I tried very hard to experience it and then judge it on its own merits. All issues considered, my rating of it is explained as follows: I think it offers pleasant but unexceptional entertainment (Three Stars) and several bonus features that add one Star to my rating.

My guess is that, in general, adults enjoy the special features (other than interactive games such as ""Mowgli's Jungle Ruins Maze"") more than children do. In the sequel, the plot remains faithful to the beloved Rudyard Kipling novel, this time featuring the voices of  John  Goodman, Haley Joel Osment, Mae Whitman,  and Jim Cummings. Phil Collins provided the voice of Lucky. I watched this film with several of my younger grandchildren, none of whom had seen the 1967 version. Unlike their parents and grandparents, they and other children ages 4-14 seem to think nothing of watching a film they like several times either in a theatre or a DVD of it, whether or not it is a sequel.

Although a sequel offering solid entertainment to ""children of all ages,"" I doubt if it will not have the same enduring appeal from one generation to the next as do other feature length animated films produced by Disney (e.g. Bambi, Beauty and the Beast, Dumbo, Pinocchio, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) and Pixar (e.g. Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and WALL-E) nor by DreamWorks  (e.g. Antz and Shrek). I agree with  my grandchildren: it was fun to watch but generates no interest in seeing it again soon. It must join a long line ahead of it.",1215820800,,1863,4.781931464174455
1866928,4,B00008Y47T,"There is no shortage of comment about the relative merit or lack thereof concerning Disney's direct-to-video sequels. I'd prefer to look at each on a case-by-case basis. Several of these sequels, especially The Lion King 1 1/2, that have a lot going for them, particularly when they take the characters into interesting territory but retain the look and flavor of the original.

It's much tougher when contemporary artists, writers -- and the corporate decision makers who have multiple company initiatives to contend with -- tackle the Walt-era classics. They're being re-created with totally different artists under vastly different circumstances -- most of all, without the same budget, luxury of time and creative guidance. Taking all of this into consideration, it's a wonder that so many of them succeed as well as they do.

The Jungle Book 2 falls somewhere between the extremes. It's impossible to follow Phil Harris, but few can handle such a thankless task than John Goodman, who after all, has equally formidable voice acting skills of his own -- as Sully in Monsters, Inc. for just one example. Haley Joel Osment does a fine job as Mowgli, being after all, a highly seasoned child actor. And Mae Whitman, who plays Shanti (known as ""The Girl"" in the original film) must have impressed Disney staffers enough to return to direct-to-video in the history-making role of Tinker Bell in the direct-to-video feature coming in October.

The film also offers musical showpieces that rival the original in energy and execution. The only issue is, just like the 1969 Disneyland record album sequel More Jungle Book, this film kind of chews its cabbage twice. Mowgli goes back to the jungle, discovers he really doesn't totally belong there and returns to the man village this time able to revisit his old friends.

But let's face it -- where else could you take the story without sacrificing the elements expected from the first? Mowgli Goes to College? Mowgli Rules at Camp Rock? (Well, that last one just may happen.)

The DVD itself is basically a reissue of the earlier release, containing all the previous materials with one new feature:  ""Mowgli's Story Time Adventure,"" an interactive storytelling activity. Nothing seems to have been deleted from the previous DVD edition.",1214438400,,2282,5.072
1866929,4,B00008Y47T,"This 2003 sequel to the beloved 1967 Disney movie ""The Jungle Book"" is basically familiar territory that rarely strays far from the original as far as its characters, plot, and villains. Yet, it is an enjoyable romp that makes for a nice addition to the original. In the 5 years since its release, computer animation has come a long way, so some of the computer shadings and other effects seem almost primitive compared to what we are accustomed to; the harsh computer shading detracts a bit from the visual presentation. I don't know that I would go to a theater to view this widescreen presentation, but for a home video release, it is right on the money.

Storywise, Mowgli has been living in the village with humans for about 4 years; Baloo misses Mowgli, and Mowgli is having a hard time forgetting the jungle, despite the fact that he has become closer Shanti, the girl who enticed him to live in the jungle in the first place. Can you see it coming? Shanti's fear of the jungle causes Mowgli to renounce the village, return to Baloo, and of course, Shere Khan is not far behind. Shanti & her little brother go after Mowgli, adding two more villagers for Shere Khan and Kaa to hunt. The catchy Sherman Brothers tunes from the original are re-used (""The Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna' Be Like You"") as well as a few fun new original songs, ""Jungle Rhythm"" and ""W-I-L-D""). Closing credits have the rock group Smash Mouth doing an awesome cover version of the song ""I Wanna' Be Like You."" The voice talent for the movie is impressive: John Goodman fills the mighty big shoes of the late Phil Harris as Baloo; Haley Joel Osment voices Mowgli; Jim Cummings is amazing as Kaa, and seems to be channeling Sterling Holloway; singer Phil Collins does admirably as one of the vultures.

For the extras, there is a good amount of material here: Games & Activities include Mowgli's Story Time Adventure Game. This one uses the 2 dimensional shadow puppets featured in this films opening credits. Players punch the arrow keys on their remote to match what they see on screen. It's a bit of a yawn, and there are no fun prizes/extras when you complete the game. Mowgli's Jungle Ruins Maze is much better; players use their remote to find their way through a maze, and along the way they must answer questions about different animals; a nice mix of fun and education. Music Videos on the DVD include the Smash Mouth cover as well as the 2 original songs from the film, ""W-I-L-D"" and ""Jungle Rhythm."" A few deleted scenes are included along with explanation by Sharon Morrill (former head of Disney Toon Studios) and Matt Walker (Sr. VP of Music); the main reason scenes were deleted were to put the story focus back on Mowgli and not Shanti. Quick access to songs in the movie is included here, as well as a karaoke version of the movie. ""Backstage Disney"" includes a Reader's Digest version of the original movie and a featurette detailing the making of the movie; the featurette is really about the best bonus; it is fun to see and hear from the voice talents as well as the creative team, who does appear very excited about the movie, albeit a little self-congratulatory and over-praising.

Overall...thumbs up for the family and kids. An enjoyable film to watch with a number of fun extras.",1214006400,,3286,4.642611683848798
1866930,2,B00008Y47T,"Disney's 2003 sequel ""Jungle Book 2,"" newly released in ""special edition"" DVD, was a missed opportunity. Not because 1967's original, based on Rudyard Kipling's oft-filmed book, came 36 years before as the last animated film Walt Disney directly touched.

Nor because most of the original's distinguished voice cast couldn't return. Phil Harris (the first ""Baloo""), George Sanders (""Shere Khan""), and the legendary Louie Prima (""King Louie"") had passed since the original. But John Goodman summarizes Baloo's carefree spirit, Tony Jay gives Shere Khan Scar-like menace and Jim Cummings slips into Sterling Holloway's snakeskin nicely as Kaa. King Louie couldn't appear, allegedly due to royalty dispute, so the original's Dixieland spirit is replaced by Smashmouth's ""I Want to Be Like You"" over end credits.

The film could've been, should've been (and almost was) more about Mowgli's (voiced by Hayley Joel Osment) relationship with Shanti, the young girl who lured him to the man-village and his adopted family. Bonus features show early plans for a feistier relationship between them, dueting as equals on the omitted song ""I Got You Beat.""  In ""2,"" Shanti (voiced by Mae Whitman) timidly fears the jungle, finding her bravery when trying to rescue little brother Rajan and Mowgli himself from the vengeful Khan. (The omitted song ""Braver"" would have served as turning point for her growth). Disney producers decided Mowgli would spend most of his time singing and swinging with the animals, disappointing considering strong female characters anchored some of the studio's most acclaimed, successful films the last 20 years.

Thus, in 72 minutes, we're treated to three versions of ""Bare Necessities,"" a couple of fun but overdone production numbers ""(Jungle Rhythm"" and ""W-I-L-D""), sunnier animation than the first film's aquas and turquoise backgrounds and a brief, suspenseful showdown with Khan again recalling (at least in spirit) ""Lion King.""'s magnificent final minutes.  All this makes ""Jungle Book 2"" pleasant for young children but only an brief reprise for beloved characters and an echo of the first film's jazzy style.",1214006400,,2135,5.418674698795181

I can honestly say the original Disney Jungle Book movie was the only movie I loved that also touched my heart.

1866948,2,B00008Y47T,"What it this? Disney's original animated film `The Jungle Book' was made in 1967, and after almost 40 years they released a sequel `The Jungle Book 2.' What is the point of doing this anyway?

To be fair, the sequel is not a horrible film. It has more colors (more light colors in the jungle) and comes with the original's exhilarating `Bare Necessities.' Who can dislike this song? And the introductory part using stick puppets is cleverly done, letting us into the world of the wild child Mowgli and his friends.

But after that, about 10 minutes or so, the film suddenly starts to look not-so-ambitious attempt to re-tell the story of the original, which should have been ended 40 years ago. In this sequel Mowgli, who is fed up with the rules of the village, goes back to the jungle where his friend big bear Baloo is living and dancing to that charming song alone. Now Baloo is happy to meet the boy again for he is lonely and needs a partner to do the musical number.

But we are not so happy. That is partly because their reunion virtually ignores the original film's conclusion, and partly because we know the same story has just begun again. The difference between the 1967 version and this one is that Shanti also steps into the jungle with a little boy Ranjan, but this slight difference means little to us because both of them are quite unmemorable.

After all, the problem is not the fact that the story of `The Jungle Book 2' in fact retreads that of the original because few people would still remember the details of the film made 40 years ago. The real drawback is that in `JB2' nothing interesting happens except the last 10 minutes where the bad tiger tries to kill Mowgli. The film provides musical scenes (which are decent themselves), but they only stretch the thin story. Even though I love the song Bare Necessities, I don't want to listen to it three times in a short film that only runs 72 minutes.

To me (I am living in Japan) the most shocking thing about the film is that like the so-so film `Return to Neverland' `The Jungle Book 2' was originally made for video, and then was chosen for theatrical release in USA and UK. That they can do such a thing is as unaccountable as the company's choice of the material for the sequel.",1136246400,5,2258,4.484184914841849

1866950,5,B00008Y47T,"Hi everyone!  I hope everyone is doing well!  I LOVED this movie and there are several reasons why.  Before I go into them, let me give you a brief summary of the film.

The Plot:

This movie takes place about a month or two after the original one ended.  Mowgli has been adopted by a nice family and has a new little brother, Ranjan, who idolizes Mowgli for his life spent in the jungle. The movie opens up with Mowgli telling his new family and new best friend, Shanti, about his former life in the jungle through a puppet show.  As he gets to the part where he fought Shere Khan, the ferocious tiger, Ranjan decides to put his own twist on the story and in doing so, manages to destroy the set and embarrass Shanti in the process.  Ranjan's comment that, ""Shanti blinked her big, beautiful, brown eyes at you.  And you follow her into our village,""  prompts Shanti to turn red and deny she did anything of the sort.  This prompts a little argument between Mowgli and Shanti, forcing Mowgli's father to break it up by revealing that his wife used the same trick on him.  Shanti then makes fun of Mowgli before leaving and Mowgli tells Shanti to ""watch out for Shere Khan on your way home.""  Shanti dismisses his warning by retorting that,  ""You and your stories. Everyone knows tigers don't come into the village.""  With that, she leaves.  But Mowgli soon finds that his theory is right when Shere Khan comes back, seeking revenge against Mowgli for what Mowgli did to him.

Meanwhile, Mowgli still misses his jungle friends and they miss him.  Baloo, especially.  Baloo wants to bring Mowgli back to the jungle, but Bagheera won't hear it.  He tells Baloo that Mowgli belongs with his own kind.  Baloo disagrees and sneaks off to visit Mowgli.  Meanwhile back in the village, Mowgli and Ranjan spend their day teasing Shanti and playing on her fear of the jungle and especially of tigers.  But Shanti's fear is tested when Baloo is successful in whisking Mowgli back to the jungle and Shanti must save him.  She is accompanied by Ranjan who wants to find Mowgli too.  They encounter Kaa, who is searching for a snack and almost has one, but Ranjan stops him right when he is about to eat Shanti by hitting the snake over the head with a stick.  Mowgli and Shanti are soon reunited again and must face Shere Khan together.  The movie ends on a good note and not only does Shanti face her fear, but Mowgli is able to have the best of both worlds.  He is able to visit his jungle friends and remain in the village with his family and Shanti, who he discovers he cares for-a lot.

The Music:

This movie had some good songs and even though the Bear Necessities was reprised three times, it was still a good song for the movie.  There are also two new songs that add to the movie's greatness as well.  ""The Jungle Rhythm"", which is sung by Mowgli and his new friends in the village.  This song is one of my favorites because it's really catchy and really jazzy.  Mowgli sings this song to show Shanti, Ranjan and his other new friends just how happening the jungle life is.  His plan almost succeeds until Shanti sees what he's trying to do and gets him grounded by accident.  The other new song is ""W-Y-L-D"", which is sung by Baloo and several animals in the jungle.  This song is not one of my favorites, only because I liked ""I Wanna Be Like You"" a lot more.  Other than that, the instrumental score was really an attention grabber.  And I also enjoyed the first and last version of ""The Bear Necessities"".

Musical Extras:

The DVD also has some deleted songs that you can enjoy too.  The first song is called ""I've Got You Beat"".  This song was originally done by Mowgli and Shanti as a sort of competition to see what was better.  The jungle life or life in the village.  Although I didn't' like the version the DVD showed, I LOVE the version on the soundtrack.  The other song which is one of my absolute favorites is called ""Braver"".  It was supposed to be in the movie, but it never made it in because the producers and writers of the movie thought the song would give too much away of Shanti.  In my opinion, I think they made a huge mistake in not putting this song into the movie.  It's on the soundtrack, but I like the deleted version on the DVD a whole lot better.  I guess it's because I LOVE Shanti and she is my favorite character next to Mowgli, and Bagheera.  I love the way they developed her character and I really think Mae Whitman brings Shanti to life and she portrays her very well.  The reason I think ""Braver"" should have been in the movie is because it's a really pretty song and Shanti has a very pretty singing voice.  The other reason is that it showed how much Shanti was willing to risk for Mowgli.  She was willing to risk her fear to find him, which I think is a perfect example of what friendship really is.

The humor in this movie was easy to see too.  The humorous parts for me were when Kaa, the snake, kept getting beat up.  But my favorite Kaa scene was where Ranjan hits him over the head when he is trying to eat Shanti.  And then after Shanti snaps out of her trance and tells Ranjan to stop, he gives Kaa another whack before doing as Shanti says!  I find that totally hilarious!  The other thing I really liked about the movie was the one liners between Shanti and Mowgli.  I especially love the scene where Mowgli makes Shanti fall into the river and drop her water jug.  The look on her face and the way she growled at him was priceless!

In conclusion I really think anyone who has seen Jungle Book, should really pick up this movie.  It's a really good one and I even think it's better than the original.  So get with the Jungle Rhythm and join Mowgli, Shanti, Ranjan, Baloo, Bagheera, Kaa, Shere Khan and all their friends for another adventure full of humor, friendship and learning where you belong.

Favorite Scene:

Mowgli (to Shanti):  Well, keep your eyes and ears open and always watch your back, or the last sound you'll hear is...  (Ranjan jumps out of the bushes and roars.  Shanti screams and falls into the river, dropping her water jug.)  When does the tiger roar?

Shanti:  You're horrible!  Horrible, stinky boys!  Come on, Ranjan.  He's a bad influence.  (They walk into the village.)  Now, don't move. That wasn't very nice you know.

(Ranjan growls like a tiger.)

Shanti:  Stop that!  You're not a jungle boy.

Ranjan:  Why are you so ascared of the jungle?

Shanti:  Because it's dangerous.

Ranjan:  Dangerwis?  But Mowgli says...

Shanti:  You shouldn't listen to everything Mowgli says.

Ranjan:  But I thought you like Mowgli.

Shanti:  I do.  I-I like Mowgli.  I...I...  (She turns around to see Mowgli standing there.)

Mowgli:  You left this at the river.  (Hands Shanti her water jug back.)

Shanti:  Thank you.

Ranjan:  She's in a bad mood.

Mowgli:  Hey, Ranjan, want to see a little trick I learned in the jungle?

(Ranjan nods and Mowgli lassos some fruit down off a tree.)

Ranjan:  That's a pretty neat trick.

Shanti:  Well, here's a little trick I learned, right here at home.

(She does the same thing, but manages to get the whole lot of fruit down.)

Ranjan:  Wow!  That's a neater trick!

Shanti:  Like I said, Ranjan, don't listen to him.",1113955200,3,7231,4.451340996168582
1866951,3,B00008Y47T,"It seems like Disney can't keep their greedy little fingers off any original Disney film. They had already come out with a few sequels....namely ""The Little Mermaid 2"", ""Peter Pan 2"", and ""Pocahontas 2"", so it was only fitting that ""The Jungle Book 2"" would be next in line.

I have to admit that this movie wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the greatest either. The main plot/storyline is this: Mowgli misses life in the jungle, and it shows not only in his songs, but in his stories also. Baloo misses his little ""man cub"" too, so one night, he decides to ""kidnap"" Mowgli and take him back to the jungle. The upside is that both Baloo and Mowgli are happy again. The downside is that Mowgli's two new villiage friends -- Shanti and Ranjan -- miss him, and go out in the jungle to look for him. The story turns into a two-way tie....following the adventures of both Shanti and Ranjan, and Mowgli and Baloo. In the end, Mowgli realizes that his heart lies in the man villiage.

The animation seemed kinda so-so in my opinion. They obviously did their best to copy the original animation, and they achieved it in a way that I think was ok, but not great.

The voice acting was superb. John Goodman did a pretty good (but not great) Baloo, Haley Joel Osment presents himself nicely as young Mowgli, and Jim Cummings does a wonderful job of portraying the sly and sinister thoughts of Kaa the snake. (I had the pleasure of meeting Jim Cummings once when I was about 8-10 yrs. old, actually. Nice guy.)

All-in-all, it's a film that'll keep the kids on their toes clapping and laughing, but will have the parents waiting for it to end. *wink* It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that great either.

1866952,2,B00008Y47T,"The best of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book stories took place in the man village because that's where Mowgli meets a superstitious old hunter named Buldeo.  Buldeo claims that the tiger Shere Khan is supernatural,  the ghost of a wicked old money lender.  When Mowgli says that Shere Khan is only a very disagreeable tiger Buldeo threatens to spank our young hero.

When Buldeo learns that Mowgli has a vendetta with the tiger and a black panther as his personal body guard the old man tells the other villagers that Mowgli is a demon child who is able to turn himself from a boy to a wolf, and back to a boy at will.  This is great story telling.  But where is Buldeo?  He isn't in the movie at all!  It's like leaving the Wicked Witch out of the movie version of ""The Wizard of Oz"".

On a side note, in the Kipling stories the black panther Bagheera has a secret so shameful he can tell no one but Mowgli.  Bagheera was born in a zoo, chained and keep in a cage for the amusement of men.  But rather than blame Mowgli for the cruelty he suffered in captivity Bagheera sees the boy as a kindred spirit.  They were both separated from their own kind at an early age.  Once we have that bit of information the relationship between the boy and the panther makes sense.  We are able to understand Bagheera's total devotion to the Mowgli.  But the movie never explains that.  I realize that the movie shouldn't follow the book completely.  But since the book was so much richer the movie seemed like a let down.",1110326400,4,1506,4.379061371841155

It's interesting that some reviewers comment on the lack of plot.  The original JB plot is lacking, as well.  Get the boy out of the jungle and to the man-village to escape Shere Khan.  That lack of plot in both films, however, magnifies the difference between the two.  JB1, interestingly, is the first Disney film where the actors actually played a part in the development of the characters.  Phil Harris IS Baloo.  Same goes for Louis Prima (King Louie), Sebastian Cabot (Bagheera), George Sanders (Shere Khan) and Sterling Holloway (Kaa).
How can John Goodman, et al, compete?  In most instances, they cannot.  Goodman was awesome in Monsters, Inc., but here his performance seems lackluster and uninspired.  Same goes for most (but not all) of the other characters.
It is interesting to note that Jim Cummings who provides Kaa's voice in JB2 also is the ""modern voice"" of Pooh.  And, that Sterling Holloway who provided Kaa's voice in JB1 was the ""original voice"" of Pooh.  Cummings does a good job as Kaa in JB2.
Overall, there was no way for Disney to satisfy us adults, who grew up on the original JB (and like me who recently shelled out big bucks to get the original on DVD), but it does work on the kids' level.  And, that's what matters in my book.",1084924800,3,1536,4.783269961977187
1866967,4,B00008Y47T,"The story of Jungle Book 2 is basically a do-over of the original Jungle Book.  Mowgli once again finds himself in the jungle having a grand adventure with all of the old characters.  The only real difference is that this time he brings along two others from the ""man village"".  But that's okay.  The story was good the first time, and because of decent writing and great casting, the story is good a second time also.  Re-doing the story was a much better choice than trying to make some wierd interpretation, or just a lazily written sequel.
The casting in this movie is really good, with voices that sound authentic enough that you don't bother comparing them to the original.  Doubtless that was a big help to making this a best-ever sequel.
The music in this movie was also very good.  Reusing some of the old music, tinkering around with some new mixes, and adding some brand new scores brought together a totally fun soundtrack.  The Smashing Pumpkins never before sounded this good.
While not of the same calaber as the original Jungle Book, JB2 comes in a close second and is far better than I really expected of a sequel considering Disney's reputation for stupid, cheap, straight-to-video sequels.  There is also an option on the DVD to play just the music scores of the movie, which the children really enjoy.  Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by this sequel and hope that Disney will take this as a new standard for their sequels.",1084233600,,1451,4.677165354330708
1866968,5,B00008Y47T,"The movie starts out recapping what happened in the original Jungle Book movie, with a swingin' beat! (My girls, ages 4 & 5, were dancing all the way thru it!)

Mowgli is voiced by Haley Joel Osment, and he does a wonderful job! Mowgli is fed up with the rules of the man-village and longs for his old pal Baloo (voiced very well by John Goodman) and the jungle life. When Baloo strays into the man-village one night looking for Mowgli, Shanti (a girl from the man-village) spies him and screams ""wild animal!""  The villagers all come to her aid, but spy Shere Khan (voiced by Tony Jay) in the village instead of Baloo.  This enables Baloo and Mowgli to slip into the jungle, unseen by anyone, except Shanti. Shanti follows them, seeking to ""rescue"" Mowgli.  This is when the ""fun"" begins!

The songs are addictive! (and annoying if your 5 yr old sings them for days on end!) I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as did my kids! We've watched it numerous times and would recommend it to all! It is a delightful story and a joy to watch!

1866973,2,B00008Y47T,"I actually purchased this movie after hearing the decent reviews it received. It admittedly wasn't the most horrible sequel ever. But it came pretty close. The story is all rehash. The one quote by Mowgli's foster father: ""YOU DELIBERATELY DISOBEYED ME!"" is ripped right from the ""Lion King,"" where Mufasa tells Simba the same exact thing. The story itself is feeble at best. Shanti is a shallow character who can't really remind you of anyone becuase she's just...there. There's no feeling or creativity in her. I have seen decent Disney sequels with characters I've actually been able to feel for (ie, ""101 Dalmatians II"" & ""Cinderella II""), but this unfortunately isn't one of them. The songs are...how shall we put this, corny? Cheesy? One of those food-related words that generally means ""bad"" but not ""painful to listen to, just annoying.""
Okay, the one song with the monkeys (WHY did they not include King Louie, I liked him?!) is all right. Kind of catchy--if I remember correctly. I can't think of the tune right now. But the voice of John Goodman as Baloo just doesn't fit. He's done alot of characters and done them well (ie, Sulley from Monsters Inc, NOT MIKE WAZOWSKI, who was played by Billy Crystal), but Baloo's character doesn't mesh with his voice; the two don't work together. *shrug* It's difficult to explain. It just does not sound right, it's not a good mix.
Ths plot is basically just a redo of the original, with Shere Kahn out stalking Mowgli for revenge and a pretty dumb new vulture named Lucky. The humor is almost not present; I can't remember laughing. It kept me moderately entertained for maybe an hour, then I kinda wished it was over, then I decided I'd probably never end up watching it again and regretting that I'd bought the thing! This movie did have a FEW things going for it, I do know that much....I just can't seem to recall what they were. Which means it gave me a bad impression.

The movie has 2 songs from the first movie, and one of them is I want to be like you peformed by Smashmouth. And it has new songs like Jungel Ryhtem. And both Baloo and Mowgli doing solos.

1866995,2,B00008Y47T,"A die-hard Disney fan, I grew up with the original Jungle Book.  The music, the voices, and the animation entrenched themselves so deeply into my psyche that no sequel could have done the original justice.  The producers of this one must have understood that there are many like myself.  So instead of tackling the challenge of producing a film to rival Walt's original masterpiece, Disney took the easy road.  The result is no more than a delightly animated saturday morning kids cartoon that will keep a kid busy for an hour but will leave their parents rather frustrated.  If you're looking for a tribute to- or even a continuation of- the original Jungle Book, you won't find it in this film.
First let me tell you what I liked about the movie:  The animation is great!  In this aspect (and this aspect only) the producers have replicated and improved on the animation of the first.  The jungle is enchanting as ever, the leaves greener.  Also brilliant is the voice of Jim Cummings as Kaa and Col. Hathi.  Non voice-buffs will never be able to tell the difference between Cummings and the legendary Sterling Holloway of the original.  I have never seen a voice duplicated so well.  Cummings himself has cut himself out to be a modern Disney classic.
But other than those two things, JB2, however nicely animated, is a case of misguided nostalgia.  Either the writers have never seen the original JB, or they have completely ignored its story.  While my 2-yr-old is bedazzled by the dancing animals, I scratch my head as the list of inconsistancies gets longer and longer.
We are told by one of the producers in a bonus feature on the DVD that JB2 takes place just 5 days after the original ends.  How then, after living 8 years in the jungle with animals, has Mowgli completely adapted to human life?  I mean, they could have cut out 2 minutes of the dancing animals and explained to me how Mowgli learned the man language just 5 days after meeting a human for the first time.  Keep in mind also that Mowgli would have known Baloo for a measely couple days- yet in risking his life to re-enter the jungle, he has no desire whatsoever to revisit the pack of wolves that protected and raised him in the jungle for 8 years.
Also frustrating is the utter lack of musical creativity.  I counted 2 original songs here- Osment's butchering of the lackluster ""Jungle Rhythm,"" and the song the animals dance to at King Louie's (who, mysteriously, doesn't bother to make an appearance in this sequel).  You'd think that in the 36 years that separate these films, the folks at Disney might be able to come up with some decent music.  Nah, Disney's musical genius has been lagging behind for several years now, and JB2 is living proof.
My last beef with this movie- John Goodman as Baloo.  Ok, I know he did a great job as Sully on Monsters, Inc., but he doesn't hold a candle to the brilliance of Phil Harris.  Not that anybody could, but you think with their pool of talent they could at least come close.  Goodman has talent, yes.  Unfortunately it's not in cartoon voicing or singing.  Goodman seems lost with Baloo; the character completely eludes him.  This could be because he was the wrong voice for the character. Ed Gilbert, who voiced Baloo in the ""Tail Spin"" cartoon, could have done a whole lot better.
Bottom line: Rent it for your kid, but be ready to cringe.  Another awful Disney sequel.",1058745600,12,3397,4.608985024958403
1866996,3,B00008Y47T,"When i say sequal, i mean excluding Resculers Down Under and Toy Story 2, just to put that straight.
I hate the sudden Disney sequels. There a insult to the orignals, they bring down the quality of Disney cartoons, and sitting through most of them, to me, is like having a root canel.
Then came this one. It was giving to me as a gift, much to my disapproval, and couldn't be returned. I decided to just throw it in a see how much i clinged, which i did once. Oddly, i found myself laughing at certain parts. They actually did a decent job finding voices that matched, tho i kept on hearing ""i see dead people"" in my head. It wasn't the best, but it was, compared to the other sequals, half way decent.
The story is basically about Moguli's life after the jungle in the village, with his new family, including a step brother (who is adorable) and a best friend. But he becomes home sick, and with the help of Baloo, goes back into the jungle, with his best friend and step brother going in after him to find him.
The songs get old FAST - they could have cut out most of them to me. The new charcters - esp Lucky, a vulture who lives up to his name - are good. The old charcters have the same feel to them that they did in the orignal.
Now, the orignal Jungle Book has never really been a favorite of mine in the Disney collection. However, i do actually think that maybe Disney, as much as i DON'T want to see more, is actually getting a clue on how to do a decent, straight to video (tho this one was in theatres for about a week) sequals.",1056067200,,1540,4.136666666666667

1866998,4,B00008Y47T,"While Jungle Book 2 isn't in the same league as the original, it's a pleasantly surprising sequel. Why pleasantly surprising? Well, the writing, animation and production values are all quite good and consistent with the stuff we've seen in the more cutting edge Disney vehicles. The voice casting is quite good as well; the actors chosen don't imitate so much as reinterpret the roles.
Songs in Disney movies have been a problem since the death of Howard Ashman (Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin). Ashman was the consumate lyricist--his witty, informed lyrics never sounded forced. Tim Rice's lyrics for the Elton John penned Lion King music came close on occasion (as did Rice's single contribution to Aladdin). While Rice isn't quite in the same league as Ashman, his words would have made these songs better. The music doesn't sound as recycled and second hand as the direct-to-video material for Aladdin and the 40 Thieves. They also don't have the freshness that the Sherman brothers or any number of other composers might have brought to the project. While Randy Newman's material might have sounded out of place here, I could see Lyle Lovett coming up with material (please, no more Phil Collins or Sting stuff).
The DVD has some nice extras including a brief recap of the original film. The DVD I purchased came without a booklet (or even an insert with chapter listings). If Disney is getting this cheap about issuing their material on DVD, I'll be reluctant to purchase other Disney films. I find these inserts useful for the kids. I also enjoy the artwork, too.
Jungle Book 2 is an enjoyable sequel to the classic original. While it lacks the distinctive feel of the original, it makes for it with a more contemporary pace and character interactions. It's a nice addition to any Disney collection and enjoyable and appropriate for the whole family.",1055548800,5,1876,4.921135646687697

And, with all due respect to John Goodman, you are not Phil Harris. You can't compare the Baloo in this one to the Baloo in the first. This movie seems like more of a Disney money maker than a real classic. It's especially disappointing after awesome movies like Lilo and Stitch and Treasure Planet.",1055203200,3,594,4.36036036036036
1867000,4,B00008Y47T,"Some of the reviews here appear abit premature (the last couple I read were from people who hadn't even seen the movie--they judged it from the trailer!). In many respects Jungle Book 2 could, on the surface, look like a cash-in similar to the Peter Pan sequel Return to Neverland (that film had been planned as a direct-to-video release originally but turned out looking so good that it was released theatrically). That's hardly the case with Jungle Book 2.
The animation uses many of the design elements from the original film and incorporates some nice computer generated imagery as well. It's a bit surprising that folks expect the voices of the original actors. The original Jungle Book was released in 1967 (if memory serves) and all the original actors have been dead for quite some time.
The voice casting for the sequel is quite good. Haley Joel Osmond (A.I., The Sixth Sense)makes a fine Mowogli and John Goodman as Baloo captures his character perfectly without imitating the late Phil Harris. Equally good are Jim Cummings (in dual roles as both Col Hathi and the snake...whose name escapes me at the moment. Cummings also is the present day voice for Winnie The Pooh). Bob Joles manages to recall Sebastian Cabot in his portrayal of Bagheera. It's a pity his character isn't more central to the story like in the original. Phil Collins steps in as Lucky a new Vulture to torture Sheer Khan with bad puns, jokes and timing. It's ironic that Collins plays the role as the quartet of vultures from the original film were caricatures of The Beatles.
The script is both witty and the pacing swift. Children won't get bored and, yes, adults just might be entertained. Jungle Book 2 isn't a sequel as much of an update of the original film with more contemporary references. The conflict is once again between Mowgli and Shere Khan; Shere Kahn has returned to the jungle looking for revenge against the man cub. Baloo (brilliantly played by John Goodman)is bored out of his mind and rushes out to find Mowgoli again as he misses his buddy. Mowogli takes to the jungle again with Baloo when Shanti (the little girl who tempted Mowogli into the man village in the first place)alerts the town to Baloo's presence. She believes Baloo to be a dangerous wild animal. At the same time Shere Kahn has entered the village looking for Mowogli and is attacked by the villagers who believe he is the wild animal Shanti alerted them to.
Shanti, feeling guilty for her treatment of her best friend Mowogli, goes in search of Mowogli. In the process, she becomes lost in the jungle but proves she's every bit as tough as Mowogli. The film rushes to a showdown between Shere Kahn, Baloo Mowogli and Shanti in the city of ruins.
The songs are engaging (and, yes, a number of classic songs turn up again slightly jazzed up for modern audiences. These classics manage to retain their flair and charm despite the passage of 35 years). The fluid animation, acting and witty script are not captured very well in the trailer that played late last year and early this year. The Jungle Book 2 is every bit a worthy sequel to the original. While it doesn't quite live up to the original film's spectacle and songs, it recaptures much of the fun of the first film without pandering to its audience.
My children were captivated by the film and I found it enjoyable as well. I have to admit I had my doubts but this fine production quickly won me over. It's definitely worth a visit to the theater to catch.",1045440000,41,3484,4.666666666666667
1867001,4,B00008Y47T,"I had very low expectations for this movie.  I was very disappointed in Return to Neverland, more disappointed with Lilo and Stitch, and didn't even bother seeing Treasure Planet (I noticed that I wasn't alone.)  When I heard Disney was remaking one of my favorite classics, I thought ""Oh, no!""  But we went.
1. The first thing I noticed was the animation.  It looked like the original.  No, it isn't beautiful and it doesn't look like the stuff we are used to now, but it looks like the Disney stuff from the Classic era.  Therefore Baloo looks like Baloo, Mowgli, Kaa, etc. look like they did before.  I am glad they didn't try to re-draw them.  When they do put in more modern stuff, you really notice it and it is sort of distracting.  (Check out the log in the river and the waterfall.)
2. Next, the voices.  I actually thought this Mowgli (Osment) was better than the original.  If you really listen to the original, Mowgli isn't too great an actor.  Just the director's kid who they stuck in because they needed a kid's voice.  Shere-Khan, Kaa, Bagiera, the Elephant Patrol, etc.--I thought the voices were GREAT.  Unfortunately, the one I thought I would like the most, I liked the least.  John Goodman.  It sounded like the jazzy, Baloo, went south.  He traded in his jazz for zydeco.  Close, but too much southern-drawl accent.  If they wanted to go this route, even Harry Connick, Jr. would have been better, at least he would have been a little jazzy.
3. Music  Not enough.  Man, do we all miss Howard Ashman.  The background stuff IS good.  Nice trumpets, jazz sound.  The songs were more like top 40, though.  The King Louie stuff isn't even close to Louie Prima, so don't expect it.  Here, they kinda rip off ""I just can't wait to be king"" from Lion King--minus the quality of the music.  Still, at least they had some original (i.e. new) music.
4. Characters.  What is the deal with this baby character?  Did they really need a side-kick this bad?  They should have skipped him completely.  My 4-year olds laughed at him here and there, but he should have been cut.  The vultures, the elephants, Kaa, Shere-Khan have no musical numbers.  What a shame.  Their voices were good and their characters could have been better with a song or two.  (Provided they were decent songs.)  I never read Kiplings version, so I don't know if it follows the book.  I know that Walt Disney told the original writers to forget about Kipling in the original, so I imagine this doesn't follow the book either.  So what.  It is Disney--do any of them follow the original stories too well?
4.  Last word (if you are still bothering to read this)  No, it isn't the original.  I know it is probably just a money-making venture for Disney to re-do this and cash in on all the parents nostalgia.  But, I will continue to pay for (and enjoy mostly) the newer kids stuff.  If they see how much money they can make on a mediocre movie, maybe it will entice them to make more great ones to make even more money. I hope so.  In the meantime, seeing this remake is a lot like going to a class reunion--you will be happy to see your old friends again, but things won't be quite the same. Still, I wouldn't have missed it.",1045440000,8,3204,4.476603119584055

7987889,3,B00008Y47T,"This film is a mixed desire of animators wanting to continue the legacy of the original 1967 movie with new plot of the 2003 film. It seems this sequel has been released in theaters as Leonard Maltin gives it a review in his movie guide. He calls it pointless and a retread, two stars. However the Internet Movie Database shows one of the distributors to be the ABC network, so I think it was a TV movie, with theatrical release overseas. The film is somewhat better than two stars, yet it is true that there is too much repetition. (3 times they sing The Bare Necessities from the original film, when they should have stuck to only new songs, and it has new songs.). It is disappointing that 2 new songs focusing on Shanti were dropped and are only found in the deleted scenes. The directors and producers wanted to make this Mowgli's film, not Shanti's, but personally I would rather see more of Shanti. Much of the best part of the film is near the end with the chase scenes in the abandoned temple where There Khan is chasing Mowgli. Here Shanti and Bale distract There Khan by banging on gongs. I also liked the fact they had Tony Jay do There Khan again, as he had done that role in TaleSpin tv series. But here Jim Cummings didn't do King Louie like he did in TaleSpin, but instead he did Kaa the snake, the Colonel elephant, and the monkey M.C. No King Louie this time, which was a big disappointment. John Goodman did an excellent Ball.
  One of the reasons I got this DVD -- in addition to filling a hole in my Disney collection -- was to see Mae Whitman in another another role. I've only known her as Tinker Belle, though she has a very long list of credits on the IMDb. This film was made 5 years before she did the first Tinker Belle movie, so she sounds much younger here.
  On the whole a rather lightweight film, though the scenes at the temple were quite good. Not a pointless film, and it is a true sequel, not a retread. Not enough Shanti.",1500768000,,1959,4.315217391304348
