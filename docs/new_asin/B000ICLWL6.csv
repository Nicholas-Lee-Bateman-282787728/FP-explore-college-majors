2655182,5,B000ICLWL6,"If you've never seen the current edition of The Four Freshmen in person, you are missing one of the best vocal groups in the business.  Keep checking your area entertainment sections for any upcoming Four Freshmen performances in your area.  When you see an announcement, run quickly to your phone and/or computer and purchase your tickets in advance.  However, for right now, make sure you order ""The Four Freshmen - Live From Las Vegas"" DVD.  It's 80 minutes of that unique Four Freshmen harmony,applied to some of the great selections from the (ubiquitous) Great American Songbook. Bob, Brian, Curtis & Vince (as I keep saying) are the freshest Four Freshmen ever and their vocal presentation is, as usual, superb. Whenever you feel stressed, just pop this DVD in your player, and you'll know why it's a keeper!",1197936000,4,814,4.91970802919708
2655183,5,B000ICLWL6,"This DVD is a real blessing for me because the group isn't coming anywhere close to me anytime soon.  The video editing and production is generally fine, and for the most part doesn't intrude on the performances.  However, the audio quality is just great, so for best results, play loud!  My great hope is that these guys will sell enough units to allow them to do another studio album to follow up ""In Session"".  I heartily recommend this DVD for anybody who loves being amazed by true masters doing their thing.

2655184,5,B000ICLWL6,"I have been a fan of the Four Freshmen since the 1950's, and the current group which bears the torch for the FF tradition is absolutely SENSATIONAL!  The vocal blend of Brian, Curtis, Vince, and Bob is energetic and stylistically true to the original Freshmen sound, and each member is a virtuoso instrumentalist in his own right.  You FF die-hards out there are about to be AMAZED!  Three very minor issues on this product: 1) the placement of ""Indian Summer"" is listed incorrectly in both places on the DVD jacket, although correctly listed on the DVD's Menu itself; 2) as the credits rolled at the end, I was settling-in for ""My One and Only Love,"" only to have it cut short as the credits faded (darn); 3) finally, the sparse, ""live"" audience at the Suncoast Hotel in Las Vegas did not do justice to the spell-binding performance of these four chaps--the response of the audience was ""tired"" and void of any true understanding of the talent, or of the genre for that matter, of the performance they were experiencing.  Had I been there, I would have been yelling, screaming, and clapping until my hands were raw!  As original Freshman, Bob Flanigan, said in his introduction, ""This group is the best Four Freshmen of all time.""  I think he's right!",1173484800,13,1252,4.69406392694064
2655185,5,B000ICLWL6,"This is a great performance by the current Four Freshmen roster. The only other video recordings of the Freshmen you can buy are on the ""Easy Street"" VHS or DVD, and those are all from a 1950's TV show and often involved the group acting out their song on a set. This is over 20 songs from a live performance, where they play their own instruments, and very well at that. The harmonies of course are dead-on and in my opinion the current group's vocal projection is even better and clearer than the older groups. I was also surprised to see how well each of them play their respective instrument.",1162857600,15,596,4.427272727272728
8144999,4,B000ICLWL6,"The late Bob Flanigan of the original Four Freshmen did a n excellent job of keeping the sound of the group pure to the original.  This video presents proof of that.  It is great. It is a live performance of the Freshmen standards.  The quality of the DVD is good. The sound is Stereo  but sounds great.  However, I do miss the Trombone sound  which is not one of the instruments used in this performance. It is still, tho, a great representation of the ""live"" shows of the Original Freshmen.",1429488000,,492,4.411111111111111
8145000,3,B000ICLWL6,"I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED THE FOUR FRESHMAN AND OF COURSE I AM PARTIAL TO THE ORIGINAL ONES BUT THEY ARE ALL GOOD. I HAD NOT SEEN ALL THESE FELLOWS BEFORE BUT RECALL THE ONE FROM SEATTLE,BOB FERREIRA, AND THE ONE THAT WAS HIRED OUT OF COLLEGE ,BRIAN EICHENBERGER, SO THE OTHER TWO ARE NEW TO ME. I HATE TO SAY IT BUT I PREFERRED THE GROUP BEFORE THEM MORE. STILL I AM NOT SORRY I
PURCHASED THE DVD BUT WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HEARD MORE OF THE ORIGINAL SONGS.",1390694400,,456,4.0777777777777775
8145001,5,B000ICLWL6,Now this was the greatest.  You can tell they were coached by the REAL Four Freshman.  These kids brought it all back and were so good.  It is absolutely unbelievable.  It is as though we were transported back 50 years.  I hope they make it.  I really do.  A great DVD and we loved it.  There is nothing like the Four Freshman harmony.  The closest was the Beach Boys but they didn't do it the same way.,1386288000,,403,4.12987012987013
8145002,5,B000ICLWL6,One night I couldn't sleep and turned on Public Television.  These 4 were singing and playing a club in Vegas. I couldn't stop listening.  They're as good as any of the many great signers/musicians who've been a part of the Four Freshmen over the years.,1355616000,,253,4.6
8145003,5,B000ICLWL6,"- there is so much love for this group even tho the last two originals died in 2011 (Bob Flanigan and Ross Barbour)- I purchased my first Four Freshmen album in l956 in Germany  when I was in the army, and I have been a big fan ever since. The group on this dvd is the 22d version of the freshmen, and they have been together since 2001- they are fabulous - everybit as good as the originals.
The four freshmen sound is terrific- unequalled- the best singing group of all time- attested by the fact that there are members of the Four Freshmen Society from 26 countries... and the group is still going strong- I don't know of any other group in the history of show business that can say that.  Buy this DVD you will love it- I would give it 10 stars if that many were available.

8145004,5,B000ICLWL6,This was great! These guys are really talented and are really keeping the torch alive for this great music started by the original group.,1286841600,,137,4.75
8145005,5,B000ICLWL6,"fantastic dvd purchased, good service was provided, and the pricing and postage was of normal amount. Thank You.",1280620800,,112,5.277777777777778
8145006,5,B000ICLWL6,"This is a dvd that you will want to watch again AND again, and enjoy it with family and friends as well.  These Four Freshmen never disappoint, ever, and you will see why after just the first few minutes. Their close harmony is flawless, and they even play their own instruments. Each of the guys is enormously talented, creating music and performing outside of the group as well. We have asked them to perform twice for private engagements, have traveled  on a jazz cruise with them, have attend their annual convention when we can, and we go to their website regularly to see their tour schedule so that we can pick up a show if they happen to be performing near wherever we happen to be. Are we huge fans?  YES!  Do we give this dvd the highest recommendation? YES! You could give this as a gift and receive rave reviews for your brilliant musical knowledge and taste, for sure!!",1243382400,,882,4.49375
8145007,5,B000ICLWL6,"I first saw and heard this latest version of The Four Freshman on a PBS DVD on music of the 1950's, and these guys sang Graduation Day, and I could not believe how great they sounded and how they sounded exactly like the original group.  I'm a little too young to remember the original group in their heyday, but I certainly appreciate great music and great vocalizing, and love the original Four Freshmen.
I bought this DVD, and could not be more pleased.  Although they do not sing Graduation Day or Day by Day on this show, there are plenty of great songs, and I repeat, it is astounding how great these young guys sound and well as play musical instruments.  I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough--it is fantastic.
Check out The Four Freshmen website where you can check out their upcoming shows, as well as buy stuff, including this DVD.",1234224000,3,846,4.552631578947368
8145008,5,B000ICLWL6,"In the opening sequence of this DVD Bob Flannigan (retired lead singer from the original For Freshmen) announces the present group as the best Four Freshmen group ever and I agree! Both as a vocal group, but also as instrumentalists these four men are great. I saw the original group live at an US Airforce Base (where I was playing in a band)in 1965 and was impressed then, but feel that these guys are even better. If you like jazzy vocal groups, just go out and buy this DVD.
