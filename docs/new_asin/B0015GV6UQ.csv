3144804,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I have camped and hiked mountainous terrain all my life and was very reluctant to pay a lot of money for a couple of ""sticks"". I was finally convinced to give them a try and actually just picked up this DVD on my way to the cash register. What could there be to knowing how to use two sticks? My ignorance was astounding! Fortunately the salesperson gave me very good advice on selecting a set of poles. Watching the DVD revealed just how much I did not know about proper use and technique. This DVD will teach you everything you need to know from selection to proper technique and adjustment to the reasons for using hiking poles in the first place. I highly recommend this Video. Watch it, use your poles, then go back and watch it again to correct all the mistakes you made by not paying enough attention to the instruction the first time you watched it. You will learn something new every time you watch it. It is conveniently broken down into sections so you can watch any particular subject without wading through the entire video.

After I watched the DVD the first time and started using my poles, I kept having pain and numbness in my thumbs. After reviewing the DVD and paying better attention to the instructions for adjusting the proper pole length, I had no more trouble and the increase in comfort and dexterity was amazing. The authors are very happy to help with your questions through their accompanying website.

Even if you are experienced using poles, you will most likely learn something from this DVD. If you are new to using poles, this DVD is a must in order to get started correctly, for there is a lot to know regarding proper adjustment and use.",1291939200,11,1672,4.533112582781457

3144810,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I ordered this video used for $7 from Amazon.com after purchasing a pair of Leiki trekking poles at a local outdoor shop. The employees at the shop didn't seem to know much about how to use the poles, and after walking the trails at a nearby nature preserve with them several times, I felt I needed more information. In the video the instructions for how to use the poles are presented sequentially, building on prior information and giving lots of examples of different situations in which you would use the various techniques being shown. I found out that I was not using the poles correctly at all. I practiced with the poles along with the video at home to learn the techniques, which are very simple and easy to learn. Now when I hike the trails, the poles make a real difference and I feel confident that they are used properly.
I had a total hip replacement 6 months ago and also have arthritis in the other hip and feet. Using the trekking poles properly helps me exercise without overly taxing the joints. Plus the poles give you a full body workout. I can really tell the difference. The video goes into the body mechanics of using the poles, so you understand how they are assisting your joints and also to alert you to things not to do so you avoid stressing both your lower joints and also your wrists, elbows and shoulders.
If you are interested in using trekking poles, do yourself a favor and get the video. There is also a web site by the same people who published the video that gives a lot of information about proper use of the trekking poles, [...]",1278547200,34,1569,4.470383275261324
3144811,5,B0015GV6UQ,"This homespun, yet well-done, video pretty much outlines all you want to know about trekking poles. In fact, it will contain information that won't be necessary for your specific needs. But that's the mark of a thorough resource, right? I'm the kind of guy who wants to acquire technique when incorporating something new into an everyday activity. There are other approaches to using trekking poles, but this one worked very well for me and I suggest it whenever I see someone experiencing difficulty with their poles. I bought poles for my hike into and out of the Grand Canyon. I reached the bottom free of knee strain and pain. And hiking out was easier because I was able to incorporate my core and upper body into the process. Props to Jayah Faye Paley for filming this video and to me for following her instruction.",1277596800,7,821,4.708333333333333

It even includes an MD discussing how the correct use of poles relates to the physical body.

3144817,5,B0015GV6UQ,"Trekking and hiking poles come in such a wide range of prices that I read several pole reviews to try to learn whether it was a case of ""you get what you pay for"" or ""why waste money on an expensive version of a simple object.""  That is where I came upon rave recommendations for this video.  This video is inexpensive, so I bought it before buying poles for my daughter.  GREAT purchase.  Helped me decide on the poles but more importantly, it showed me how to use them effectively.  WOW.  I know this video has saved a lot of wear and tear on my knees as well as made my hikes safer and easier.

3144819,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I thought that ""Poles for Hiking, Trekking & Walking"" wouldn't have much to teach me. (I have two kinds of poles--collapsible and non-collapsible, and I've been using the poles for distance walking for several years.) But how wrong I was! I think this well-made DVD should help accustomed users as much as absolute beginners, and I learned quite a few new things.

There are helpful techniques for all kinds of terrain and situations--flatlands, mountains and hills, stair climbing and descending. The pole positions are carefully described and demonstrated, with explanations  of why some things work better than others.

Most of the explanations relate better to adjustable poles than to the non-adjustable kind which are my favorites. I wish more attention had been paid to the latter kind of poles. However, this was only a slight reflection on an otherwise excellent presentation, and I recommend it to all trekking pole users, both present and potential.",1414713600,,960,5.220779220779221

3144824,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I recently became interested in using trekking poles after I had a health related episode in my life.  I am sort of a nut about researching stuff like this, and I started searching on the internet and utube.  I soon learned that while there are a lot of small bits of information out there, very little of it went into great detail.  I learned of Jayah's tapes after finding her websites.
  The tapes are fantastic!  They really break down all of the information you should know about using the poles properly. They include drills for learning the proper muscle memory.  They not only explain why using the poles her way works so well, they also show some of the ways using the pole incorrectly can be bad for you.  Using the poles properly is not difficult, but you definitely need to be shown how.  She really knows what she is talking about, and is good at teaching that knowledge to others.
  Customer service has been unreal!  I emailed her a question after reading her website and she called me back on the phone the next day with an answer.  I hadn't even bought anything from her yet, that is impressive.  To me it shows a belief and a dedication in what she is teaching.  It is not all about the money.
  If you have any questions about the use of trekking poles, these tapes are the answer.",1404518400,,1300,4.417721518987341

3144828,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I discovered Trekking poles last year and at first thought they were for people who were having problems with balance and or strength.  Come to find out, they are for all levels of hikers.  Even the most powerful and competent hiker can benefit from them.  Stop looking at poles as ""hiking aids"" and see them for what they are ""four wheel drive"" for the hiker.  I initially saw a U tube clip done by Jayah Faye Paley and got the basic technique.  If you hike and use poles you need this CD.  I have looked everywhere for proper instructions and discovered that very few people, even those selling poles, know how to use them.  Most instruction videos that I came across on the internet showed improper technique.  I'd say that easily 75 percent of the people I come across on the trail are using their poles incorrectly.  I ran into a group of about a dozen people on Mt Rainer that were had been outfited and were being led by a guide over some tough terrain and not a one was using their poles correctly.  Most people are using them as walking sticks rather than a propulsion and shock absorbing system.  Balance is also an important aspect of their use.  Get educated, buy this CD or watch one of her U tube videos.  She knows of what she speaks.  It's all in the straps.  Your poles should swing loosely in your hands by the straps,  If you constantly have your poles in a ""death grip"" you aren't getting the most out of them and possibly causing yourself problems as well.",1377820800,2,1477,4.4148148148148145

3144833,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I live in the UK, and I ordered this DVD with a little trepidation, not being sure if it would play here, but it does, on both my TV and my Apple Mac. I bought it to learn how to use my newly-acquired pair of trekking poles properly, and have been very impressed by the clarity and simplicity of the instructions and the ease with which I've been able to learn the techniques. As a yoga teacher I know how rare it is for a video to communicate as effectively as a real, live teacher, and this is one of those rare exceptions. Jayah and Bob are excellent teachers who know how to communicate extremely effectively: there isn't a single unclear or confusing word in it, and the demonstrations are equally good. I'm grateful to them for the pleasure of learning a new skill. And the filming has been done in magnificent locations! It's altogether a wonderful, inspiring product, highly recommended for anyone who wants to walk with poles. I love it.",1367971200,2,946,4.505813953488372
3144834,5,B0015GV6UQ,"This is an outstanding video!  It is absolutely packed with information -- even more than I would have imagined.  The instruction is very comprehensive and very easy to follow.  There is enough here to watch multiple times. I would very strongly recommend this video to anyone who uses trekking poles for hiking, even if you already have some experience.  The instruction is great and there are lots of good tips.  Jayah Paley is an expert on the most effective ways to use poles and also common traps to avoid, and she has very obviously thought about how to teach this to people and has had lots of experience doing it.  If you have not yet bought your poles, it would also be great to watch this video first, so that you know what to look for.  Another good source of advice on what to look for in poles is available on Jayah Paley's 2 websites, which are mentioned on the dvd and which are also have lots of good information.  The video is very professionally done and a joy to watch. Just the right touch.  First class in every respect.  I'm very glad I bought it.

And the good news is that the techniques taught in the video really do work -- and they make a big difference!!!  I've been hiking for all my life, but finally decided my knees needed some help from some of the long and very steep downhill sections here locally, where there are some really killer hills, knee wise.  (It's not unusual for me to take a weekly hike of 15-18 miles and 3000-4000 ft. of elevation gain.)  I have been very surprised at how much the poles have radically changed the long downhill experiences as far as my knees go -- and also how helpful they are on the uphills as well.  They're great!  I give the credit to the excellent technique taught on the video.  It's not enough just to use poles, you need to know how to use them properly to get the real benefit.  The DVD will show you how.",1365552000,2,1883,4.346704871060172
3144835,5,B0015GV6UQ,"After being intrigued by hiking poles and hearing some positive recommendations by pole-users on my local trails, I purchased a pair of reasonably good ones on sale at another online shop, but once I received them was not really clear on how to correctly use them. Ms. Paley gives classes at some of my local parks, but they tend to fill up quickly and/or be on inconvenient days for me. I learned about this video from her website, and figured that at ten dollars I couldn't go wrong. As it turns out the video exceeded my expectations. Correctly using poles is not intuitive, at least not for me (nor, evidently, for most people I see on the trails, now that I know what I am doing).  While in-person instruction is no doubt better if you can get it, I feel this video provided me with all the relevant and useful info I need to use poles correctly, and I found the instruction in these videos to be clear, pleasantly presented, and comprehensive.",1359417600,3,949,4.517441860465116

3144837,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I was injuring my knees hiking to prepare for a longer hike.  I bought this out of desperation, hoping to pick up a tip or two about using the hiking sticks to lessen the jarring to my knees hiking downhill on the mountain trails around here.

I was doing everything wrong, how I was putting my hands through the straps, setting the length of the poles, movement of the poles and placement of the poles for uphill and downhill hiking.  This made a big difference in my hike, I only made 60 miles after changing techniques (the knees had not healed yet), but my son 11 year old son made 110 miles.

I wish I had discovered this video before I had hurt myself.  Watching other hikers on the Appalachian Trail that we passed, I would say the majority of the hikers are using their sticks incorrectly.",1352419200,3,797,4.394557823129252

3144839,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I am in my 70's and have been an avid sea kayaker for a number of years.  However during the past three years I had orthopedic surgeries for a ruptured achilles tendon, a ruptured shoulder tendon, and an extensive spinal fusion,  The long recoveries from these surgeries kept me off the water and out of the gym, so now that I have been cleared to resume those activities, I need to get back in shape.  My family is planning a trip to the Galapagos in June, and the tour operator suggested that trekking poles would be helpful.

Fortunately, the salesman at EMS told me to order the DVD and learn how to use the poles correctly.  I did, and quickly learned the right way to use them, rather than the wrong methods I had used when hiking on lava beds in Hawaii a few years ago.

In addition to learning how to use them right, I learned from the DVD how the poles can provide a more complete workout.  I find using treadmills and elliptical machines in the gym very boring, so I am delighted to now do most of my fitness rebuilding in NYC's large, hilly parks...even some glacial rock outcroppings I'll tackle in a few weeks.

On the DVD, there is excellent demonstrations by Jayah Paley of proper techniques in all terrains, and advice about poles. Guess what? That's not the best part. You can email Jayah Paley and get personal advice. I sent her an email not really expecting to get a timely response or any response. I got an email the next day, and she suggested we chat on the telephone. I called her the next day, and she went over my physical limitations. She then explained the advantages and disadvantages of each pole set. We must have spoken for 30 minutes.

3144841,5,B0015GV6UQ,This DVD is very informative and helpful.  I have been using trekking poles for a couple of years and bought this DVD after attending one of Jayah's classes.  I learned that there are many more techniques than I was aware of.  I like the segment on nordic walking and appreciated the information on showshoing also.  I can tell that Jayah put a lot of thought into this production.  The scenes were filmed in various locations which also keeps this fun to watch.,1320105600,2,462,4.585365853658536
3144842,5,B0015GV6UQ,"Hiking seems natural so who knew you need to know how to do it right?  Well, you do.  I enjoy hiking and when I had both of my knees replaced, I kept on hiking.  I was still able to climb intermediate trails without much problem but I was more tired at the end.  With 2 artificial knees and an earlier injury that left me with plates and screws in one ankle, I decided to see if I could compensate for the loss of lateral movement when climbing over rocks and roots.  I bought some good poles and have been using them and yes, they do help.  Then I bought the video which I should have purchased before I bought the poles.  Better late than never, though, because this video is fantastic.  I found out I was working way harder than I should be and the tips and hints are fantastic.  Simple.  Smart.  Practical.  It's real people doing real things.  And after using the poles the correct way, I can tell you they work better than I would have ever known!  I no longer worry about the stress on my artificial joints and the new confidence with these poles has given me the courage to maintain a fairly aggressive hiking schedule.  I have gotten over my ""death grip"" (which I didn't even know I had) and one simple hint for descending a hill has changed my hiking routine dramatically.  No matter how long you have been hiking, this video is a must.  My husband loves working with poles now, also, and we are having a better time than ever.",1315180800,7,1437,4.302238805970149

The DVD was extremely helpful in preparing for the class, and it remains very useful for reviewing and refreshing the things that I learned. The Adventure Buddies Web site and blog that are referenced in the DVD contain a goldmine of additional information, including a detailed section on how to select poles (which can be very overwhelming).

Whether one has interest in poles or plans to trek or not, the first DVD is such a joy to experience!  The scenic grandeur shown is worthy of National Geographic in my humble estimation, and the wonderful vignettes of curious trekkers were so fascinating.  And the instructional DVD could not be better.  Those from 10 to 100 years old will find it completely ""user-friendly"".  Those who are infirm and/or have disabilities will find they won't understand how they ever did without this information!  Walking/hiking is the safest effective physical exercise for the human body.  One may trek almost anywhere, anytime.  Investing in a decent pair of poles (and hiking shoes/boots) pays off in spades.  The poles are highly portable as they may very easily be disassembled into 3 pieces less than 18 inches long.  I don't go anywhere without my poles!

I have made suggestions to hiking buddies when I see them using poles incorrectly and they have asked where I learned these tips.  I told them about Jayah's video and her classes.

I was finally convinced to give them a try and actually just picked up this DVD on my way to the cash register. What could there be to knowing how to use two sticks? My ignorance was astounding! Fortunately the salesperson gave me very good advice on selecting a set of poles. Watching the DVD revealed just how much I did not know about proper use and technique. This DVD will teach you everything you need to know from selection to proper technique and adjustment to the reasons for using hiking poles in the first place. I highly recommend this Video. Watch it, use your poles, then go back and watch it again to correct all the mistakes you made by not paying enough attention to the instruction the first time you watched it. You will learn something new every time you watch it. It is conveniently broken down into sections so you can watch any particular subject without wading through the entire video.

After I watched the DVD the first time and started using my poles, I kept having pain and numbness in my thumbs. After reviewing the DVD and paying better attention to the instructions for adjusting the proper pole length, I had no more trouble and the increase in comfort and dexterity was amazing. The authors are very happy to help with your questions through their accompanying website.

The employees at the shop didn't seem to know much about how to use the poles, and after walking the trails at a nearby nature preserve with them several times, I felt I needed more information. In the video the instructions for how to use the poles are presented sequentially, building on prior information and giving lots of examples of different situations in which you would use the various techniques being shown. I found out that I was not using the poles correctly at all. I practiced with the poles along with the video at home to learn the techniques, which are very simple and easy to learn. Now when I hike the trails, the poles make a real difference and I feel confident that they are used properly.
I had a total hip replacement 6 months ago and also have arthritis in the other hip and feet. Using the trekking poles properly helps me exercise without overly taxing the joints. Plus the poles give you a full body workout. I can really tell the difference. The video goes into the body mechanics of using the poles, so you understand how they are assisting your joints and also to alert you to things not to do so you avoid stressing both your lower joints and also your wrists, elbows and shoulders.

There are other approaches to using trekking poles, but this one worked very well for me and I suggest it whenever I see someone experiencing difficulty with their poles. I bought poles for my hike into and out of the Grand Canyon. I reached the bottom free of knee strain and pain.

I think this well-made DVD should help accustomed users as much as absolute beginners, and I learned quite a few new things.

There are helpful techniques for all kinds of terrain and situations--flatlands, mountains and hills, stair climbing and descending. The pole positions are carefully described and demonstrated, with explanations  of why some things work better than others.

Most of the explanations relate better to adjustable poles than to the non-adjustable kind which are my favorites. I wish more attention had been paid to the latter kind of poles.

3379321,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I recently became interested in using trekking poles after I had a health related episode in my life.  I am sort of a nut about researching stuff like this, and I started searching on the internet and utube.  I soon learned that while there are a lot of small bits of information out there, very little of it went into great detail.  I learned of Jayah's tapes after finding her websites.
  The tapes are fantastic!  They really break down all of the information you should know about using the poles properly. They include drills for learning the proper muscle memory.  They not only explain why using the poles her way works so well, they also show some of the ways using the pole incorrectly can be bad for you.  Using the poles properly is not difficult, but you definitely need to be shown how.  She really knows what she is talking about, and is good at teaching that knowledge to others.
  Customer service has been unreal!  I emailed her a question after reading her website and she called me back on the phone the next day with an answer.  I hadn't even bought anything from her yet, that is impressive.  To me it shows a belief and a dedication in what she is teaching.  It is not all about the money.

3379325,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I discovered Trekking poles last year and at first thought they were for people who were having problems with balance and or strength.  Come to find out, they are for all levels of hikers.  Even the most powerful and competent hiker can benefit from them.  Stop looking at poles as ""hiking aids"" and see them for what they are ""four wheel drive"" for the hiker.  I initially saw a U tube clip done by Jayah Faye Paley and got the basic technique.  If you hike and use poles you need this CD.  I have looked everywhere for proper instructions and discovered that very few people, even those selling poles, know how to use them.  Most instruction videos that I came across on the internet showed improper technique.  I'd say that easily 75 percent of the people I come across on the trail are using their poles incorrectly.  I ran into a group of about a dozen people on Mt Rainer that were had been outfited and were being led by a guide over some tough terrain and not a one was using their poles correctly.  Most people are using them as walking sticks rather than a propulsion and shock absorbing system.  Balance is also an important aspect of their use.  Get educated, buy this CD or watch one of her U tube videos.  She knows of what she speaks.  It's all in the straps.  Your poles should swing loosely in your hands by the straps,  If you constantly have your poles in a ""death grip"" you aren't getting the most out of them and possibly causing yourself problems as well.",1377820800,2,1477,4.4148148148148145

As a yoga teacher I know how rare it is for a video to communicate as effectively as a real, live teacher, and this is one of those rare exceptions. Jayah and Bob are excellent teachers who know how to communicate extremely effectively: there isn't a single unclear or confusing word in it, and the demonstrations are equally good. I'm grateful to them for the pleasure of learning a new skill. And the filming has been done in magnificent locations!

There is enough here to watch multiple times. I would very strongly recommend this video to anyone who uses trekking poles for hiking, even if you already have some experience.  The instruction is great and there are lots of good tips.  Jayah Paley is an expert on the most effective ways to use poles and also common traps to avoid, and she has very obviously thought about how to teach this to people and has had lots of experience doing it.  If you have not yet bought your poles, it would also be great to watch this video first, so that you know what to look for.  Another good source of advice on what to look for in poles is available on Jayah Paley's 2 websites, which are mentioned on the dvd and which are also have lots of good information.  The video is very professionally done and a joy to watch. Just the right touch.  First class in every respect.  I'm very glad I bought it.

And the good news is that the techniques taught in the video really do work -- and they make a big difference!!!  I've been hiking for all my life, but finally decided my knees needed some help from some of the long and very steep downhill sections here locally, where there are some really killer hills, knee wise.  (It's not unusual for me to take a weekly hike of 15-18 miles and 3000-4000 ft. of elevation gain.)  I have been very surprised at how much the poles have radically changed the long downhill experiences as far as my knees go -- and also how helpful they are on the uphills as well.  They're great!  I give the credit to the excellent technique taught on the video.  It's not enough just to use poles, you need to know how to use them properly to get the real benefit.

Ms. Paley gives classes at some of my local parks, but they tend to fill up quickly and/or be on inconvenient days for me. I learned about this video from her website, and figured that at ten dollars I couldn't go wrong. As it turns out the video exceeded my expectations. Correctly using poles is not intuitive, at least not for me (nor, evidently, for most people I see on the trails, now that I know what I am doing).

I was doing everything wrong, how I was putting my hands through the straps, setting the length of the poles, movement of the poles and placement of the poles for uphill and downhill hiking.  This made a big difference in my hike, I only made 60 miles after changing techniques (the knees had not healed yet), but my son 11 year old son made 110 miles.

3379336,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I am in my 70's and have been an avid sea kayaker for a number of years.  However during the past three years I had orthopedic surgeries for a ruptured achilles tendon, a ruptured shoulder tendon, and an extensive spinal fusion,  The long recoveries from these surgeries kept me off the water and out of the gym, so now that I have been cleared to resume those activities, I need to get back in shape.  My family is planning a trip to the Galapagos in June, and the tour operator suggested that trekking poles would be helpful.

Fortunately, the salesman at EMS told me to order the DVD and learn how to use the poles correctly.  I did, and quickly learned the right way to use them, rather than the wrong methods I had used when hiking on lava beds in Hawaii a few years ago.

In addition to learning how to use them right, I learned from the DVD how the poles can provide a more complete workout.  I find using treadmills and elliptical machines in the gym very boring, so I am delighted to now do most of my fitness rebuilding in NYC's large, hilly parks...even some glacial rock outcroppings I'll tackle in a few weeks.

You can email Jayah Paley and get personal advice. I sent her an email not really expecting to get a timely response or any response. I got an email the next day, and she suggested we chat on the telephone. I called her the next day, and she went over my physical limitations.

I was still able to climb intermediate trails without much problem but I was more tired at the end.  With 2 artificial knees and an earlier injury that left me with plates and screws in one ankle, I decided to see if I could compensate for the loss of lateral movement when climbing over rocks and roots.  I bought some good poles and have been using them and yes, they do help.  Then I bought the video which I should have purchased before I bought the poles.  Better late than never, though, because this video is fantastic.  I found out I was working way harder than I should be and the tips and hints are fantastic.  Simple.  Smart.  Practical.  It's real people doing real things.  And after using the poles the correct way, I can tell you they work better than I would have ever known!  I no longer worry about the stress on my artificial joints and the new confidence with these poles has given me the courage to maintain a fairly aggressive hiking schedule.  I have gotten over my ""death grip"" (which I didn't even know I had) and one simple hint for descending a hill has changed my hiking routine dramatically.

However, I will keep this one in case I ever decide to take up trekking or hiking.",1297036800,4,385,4.938461538461539
3379344,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I've used hiking poles for a number of years. I guess the ""death grip"" was the technique I used all that time! Well, I recently watched the video, ""Poles for Hiking, Trekking, and Walking,"" and finally learned the correct way to use them. So often, on hikes, I have asked other hikers if there are techniques for using the ""sticks,"" and no one had any advice. This video makes their use seem to vital to successful hiking along trails. So much can be gained by watching the video!",1296432000,3,480,4.465909090909091
3379345,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I bought this dvd before I bought hiking poles to see if they were something I thought I would actually use and to see if it looked like a skill I could learn.  Yes to both.  Using a tool to hike as a quadruped makes a lot of sense.

I think the program's instruction is very good, given by people with obvious skill and experience as teachers as well as hikers.  With the dvds and two websites, I am also impressed by Jayah's generosity in offering her expertise to those of us just starting out.  I've already bought a second copy as a gift, and will order her dvd on balance and mobility also as a gift.",1295308800,3,606,4.145299145299146
3379346,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I cannot say enough about Jayah Faye Paley's two DVDs on pole-trekking. Informative, interesting, educational, srikingly beautiful, superbly edited!  Whether one has interest in poles or plans to trek or not, the first DVD is such a joy to experience!  The scenic grandeur shown is worthy of National Geographic in my humble estimation, and the wonderful vignettes of curious trekkers were so fascinating.  And the instructional DVD could not be better.  Those from 10 to 100 years old will find it completely ""user-friendly"".  Those who are infirm and/or have disabilities will find they won't understand how they ever did without this information!  Walking/hiking is the safest effective physical exercise for the human body.  One may trek almost anywhere, anytime.  Investing in a decent pair of poles (and hiking shoes/boots) pays off in spades.  The poles are highly portable as they may very easily be disassembled into 3 pieces less than 18 inches long.  I don't go anywhere without my poles!  Give yourself a treat and watch these DVDs with wonder!",1293667200,5,1056,5.152941176470589
3379347,5,B0015GV6UQ,This DVD has really helped to refine my technique.  The instructions are clear and easy to understand.  You can obtain good command of the poles by watching and practicing.  Jayeh demonstrates and explains pole use in a way that inspires you to go trekking!,1293408000,3,257,4.795454545454546
3379348,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I am thankful for the Poles for Hiking, Trekking and Walking DVD. The step by step directions are easy to follow, practicing along with the video.  Not only have I benefited from this video but have recommended it to many of my hiking companions.  I have made suggestions to hiking buddies when I see them using poles incorrectly and they have asked where I learned these tips.  I told them about Jayah's video and her classes.  One of my favorite tips was how to use the straps, resting my hands instead of grabbing the poles.  What a difference that has made at the end of a long hike.",1293321600,4,587,4.398148148148148
3379349,5,B0015GV6UQ,"Every aspect of this DVD is 5 stars.  Hiking Poles should come as standard equipment with every set of poles sold.
Nuff said.  Smiles all the miles.",1293321600,3,148,4.444444444444445

8258451,4,B0015GV6UQ,"This video is a great introduction to using hiking poles/trekking poles in the most optimal way. I learned so much by watching the video, and put everything to use at one time or another in the 5 years or so since I watched it. My only regret is that I hadnt seen the video 15 years earlier, when I first started using hiking poles for backpacking.

 I would have given the video 5 stars if not for the lack of subtitles or closed captioning.",1515888000,,442,4.25
8258452,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I am extremely happy with the program and content of this DVD, ""POLES for Hiking, Trekking & Walking"" Jayah Faye Paley carefully and thoroughly covers equipment, care, proper use, and beginner through advanced technique in the use of POLES.

8258454,5,B0015GV6UQ,"I gave these poles to my son and daughter in law for Christmas. They have used them over and over again. When asked, they said they loved them. Perfect for hiking. The hike they didn't use the poles, they said they were more tired at the end. I made a good buy. Yeah!!!!",1504569600,,270,4.113207547169812

8258456,5,B0015GV6UQ,"Although a little dated (only by a few years), this video is well worth the price and is highly recommended for those new to using trekking poles. The couple that made the video clearly enjoys using their poles and the instructions are easy to follow and adopt. I recently purchased a set of Black Diamond trekking poles, but I was concerned about using them correctly on the trail. This video is easy to watch (broken into video clips and about an hour-ish in total) and the techniques are even easier to remember. I watched the whole video all the way through and hit the trails to practice the techniques. While hiking, I tried all of the major pole techniques and was very happy with the way in which each technique assisted my pace and climbing/descending effectiveness. While most of the techniques are intuitive and come naturally, all of them should be practiced and committed to memory. The instructors even go over equipment Dos and Don'ts - correcting a few concepts that I had already developed (e.g. proper hand-strap usage, pole lengths and terrain, and tip placement). Be sure to check out their website for additional information. Well worth the price and time - highly recommended!",1446076800,,1198,4.848780487804878
8258457,5,B0015GV6UQ,"Recently I attended a free clinic at REI about using poles for hiking and trekking.  It was put on Jayah Paley, who is quite knowledgeable.  To get more information, I ordered her DVD on using poles - so glad I did!  It goes into excellent detail and provides very helpful ideas on how best to use poles in varying situations.  I've watched it a number of times, and seem to learn something new each time.  The information and explanations on the DVD are much better than anything I've been able to find on YouTube, for instance.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1444608000,,559,4.485148514851486
8258458,5,B0015GV6UQ,"This video is so worth the money.  The tips are invaluable and completely changed our hiking.  We watched the video and then went hiking in the Rockies.
