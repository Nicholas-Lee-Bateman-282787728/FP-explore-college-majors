8576886,4,B00C2YBV2I,"Well--if you like mummy films...! These films nod a little to the genre, and keep their own ambiance(with a few quirky performances mixed in) Recommended, for films of this kind.",1495411200,2,178,4.966666666666667

8576889,3,B00C2YBV2I,"Just a heads up, this version of these movies is in 3D ONLY! (you may see some photos floating around where it says something like it includes both the 2D and 3D versions (at the bottom of the front cover). These photos are NOT accurate. I contacted the distribution company directly and they told me that that photo was an early distribution photo, but that they NEVER released a 2D and 3D version of this film. The 2D version is handled by a completely different company.",1410048000,3,473,4.511627906976744
8576890,1,B00C2YBV2I,Not at all like the 3D in theaters. Comes with red/blue glasses. The image is extremely blurred and very little 3D effect apparent. Pass on this and get the regular DVDs. I'm returning after 5 minutes of blurred vision.,1402531200,2,219,4.641025641025641
