4961438,5,B0065QDKHS,This was one of those movies I saw on late night tv back in the 70's.  Its cheesy but creepy aspects of it stuck with me and I always wanted to see it again.  Glad to find it on Amazon.  Wish I could find more old late night tv movies like this: such as the original Don't be Afraid of the Dark and Last Summers Child(w/Jane Seymour).,1392854400,6,334,3.955223880597015
4961439,3,B0065QDKHS,"A teen girl (who looks just under 30yo) named Ellie Masters, is sent to the Deere Youth Home (orphanage) after her mother's brutal murder-by-hammer. The place is a den of iniquity, run by a greedy, homicidal woman and her equally crazed henchman. ""Kids"" (all in their mid to late 20s) are vanishing, said to be ""running away"". Of course, we know early on that they are being bumped off and hidden away. We also discover the girl tied up in the attic! A cop (Vic ""Mel"" Tayback) looks in on Ellie, while seeming more than a bit creepy himself. Meanwhile, a strange guy in a mask sneaks into the home, and hides in the basement. Will Ellie survive until the end? BLOOD AND LACE is a rather languid, mystery / thriller without a whole lot of mystery or thrills. Still, it is interesting at times, and even tries to be frightening w/ mixed results. The underlying theme appears to be that all adults are loathsome creatures, out to destroy our youth, and that hammers are baaadd!...",1366070400,3,977,4.556818181818182

4961441,2,B0065QDKHS,"Blood and Lace (Philip S. Gilbert, 1971)

(note: review originally published 2Feb2010)

As I am won't to do now and again, I found a going-out-of-business warehouse sale and scored a small mountain of movies to watch. Well, mountain may be a bit inaccurate, but I can build a good foot-and-a-half pyramid out of VHS and DVD cases new to my house. (That this is because yet another local video store chain is on the brink of going out of business has not escaped my notice, and I am no less saddened because I gained by it.) The only problem with such bounty is that sometimes you have so many choices you end up wondering what to watch first. Any of the hundred movies I haven't seen before? No, not me. I decided I'd revisit Blood and Lace, a movie I first saw over thirty years ago on the late-night creature feature. Back in the late seventies, for some reason, there was a minor rage in Pittsburgh for double-billing two of my favorite cheesy seventies horror films, Blood and Lace and Shriek of the Mutilated. I saw both countless times in the late seventies and early eighties, and then they dropped off the radar. Shriek was released on DVD in 2005, and I picked it up immediately. This one still awaits a proper DVD release, so this was an old, old VHS copy someone dug out of the dark corner of a warehouse somewhere. This, of course, just made the nostalgia all that much greater. Remember, kiddies, back in the day, everything was broadcast and constantly adjusting the rabbit ears on your awesome twelve-inch portable TV. How could a crisp, clean transfer do that justice? In any case, seeing it through eyes that have seen another quarter-century-plus worth of movies, Blood and Lace is not nearly as complex as I thought back in the day, nor as well-acted, and I put much of my enduring affection for the film down to simple nostalgia. On the other hand, for a PG-rated theatrical release (that lasted in theaters maybe two weeks before going to the late-night creature features), Blood and Lace is a surprisingly twisted little movie.

We open with the giallo-style hammer murder of Edna Masters (Louise Sherrill, writer and director of another wonderfully cheesy late-sixties horror flick, Ghosts of Hanley House). And yes, giallo-style; there's no doubt in my mind that screenwriter Gil Lasky (the producer of the infamous Spider Baby) had Bava's Blood and Black Lace in mind when titling this monstrosity. (Seriously, look at the original posters for each.) Be that as it may, Edna left behind a daughter, Ellie (F Troop's Melody Patterson), who's something of a rebellious child. When she tries to run away from her court-appointed social worker, he sends her to a local orphanage run by Mrs. Deere (It's a Wonderful Life's Gloria Grahame, showing how far the mighty can fall) and her crazy handyman Tom (Kelly's Heroes' Len Lesser). We find out very early on that runaways in this place never actually make it, instead coming to a very bad end at Tom's hands, but that's just the tip of this perverse iceberg. Once she gets to the orphanage, Ellie strikes up a friendship with Walter (Night of the Witches' Ronald Taft), immediately incurring the wrath of her roommate Bunch (How Sweet It Is!' Terri Messina), who's been after him for a while. But the dynamics between the kids, in general, take second chair to the whacked-out psyche of Mrs. Deere, who plays everyone at the home like a puppet. There's also a police detective, Calvin (Vic Tayback, probably remembered best these days for the long-running sitcom Alice), who seems to take more than a protective interest in Ellie.

Put aside the gaping plot holes (what's Walter, who describes himself as ""almost twenty-one"", still doing at an orphanage?), the generally awful acting, Philip Gilbert's complete inability to direct (he has no other credits of any kind listed at IMDB) and Gil Lasky's script, which is utterly useless as the basis for a suspense film. Instead, focus on the fact that this movie got a PG rating (well, GP at the time) in 1971--only two years after Midnight Cowboy got an X!--when it contains overt references to pedophilia, rape, and incest. (And this isn't taking into account Mrs. Deere's crazy speculations, which are amusing, but not weird enough to warrant an R. I don't think.) Obviously, in the early seventies, it was much more shocking to be gay. Either that, or the MPAA figured that this movie was so incoherent no one would be able to figure out what's going on, which is not all that unreasonable a stance.

The movie is very little seen nowadays (probably because we understand that rape and pedophilia are more shocking than being gay now...I think), and in some ways that's probably for the best. Six years later Halloween came along and changed American horror forever. I get the feeling that many of today's kids would find this movie boring. And it is laughable, but like Shriek of the Mutilated, it's such a train wreck that you simply can't stop watching it. And when that last line hits and you realize the whole thing has been the biggest theatrical shaggy-dog joke since Ocean's Eleven, you can't help but admire the hubris it must have taken to make this movie. Lasky and Gilbert must have been as crazy as Mrs. Deere to even try. It's a movie that falls into the ""transcends bad and enters the realm of cheesy greatness"" category. See it if you get a chance. **",1352332800,11,5389,4.73482428115016

4961447,4,B0065QDKHS,"Lensed in 1971 at the beginning of the Grindhouse Exploitation boom of the '70s, BLOOD AND LACE makes its way to us in a beautifully restored DVD/BluRay combo courtesy Scream Factory. The presentation deserves more merit than the film itself--the parts definitely greater than the sum.

Teenager Ellie Masters (Melody Patterson, F-TROOP) is sent to an orphanage after her promiscuous mother and Mom's trick of the hour meet their maker by way of a nasty hammer bludgeoning, seen through a lengthy POV camera shot. Vic Tayback (ALICE) plays the detective working the case and Milton Selzer Ellie's hospital case worker. 1950s Film Noir Queen Gloria Grahame takes the role of the widowed Mrs. Deere who runs the orphanage with an iron fist and Len Lesser (SEINFELD) plays her boozy right-hand man. Mrs. Deere is a conniving witch who has some secrets in the attic and others in the deep-freeze in the basement.

Despite an intriguing premise, the movie never lives up to its' potential. There's a mishmash of ideas that don't quite gel together; the direction is flat like a Made-for-TV movie and some of the acting by the teenage orphans is substandard. Patterson is especially shrill and unlikeable and Tayback lacks the gruff bearish persona we all know him for on ALICE. Still, it's one of those cult titles that people seem to love despite the problems.

Scream Factory has given us a beautifully restored print. The title card however reads THE BLOOD SECRET which is actually a more appropriate title and the discs are in widescreen but have been cropped at the top and bottom. I posted some comparisons in the IMAGES section from my old VHS copy and this new release.

Not as gory or sleazy as it should've been and some bad acting taints it overall, but worthwhile for seeing Grahame slumming it and some early work from Tayback and Lesser.",1447632000,10,1846,4.85079365079365

4961449,5,B0065QDKHS,"This newly updated review pertains to the November, 2015 release from Scream Factory.  The transfer of the film is gorgeous, given it's low-budget origins.  The set includes both a Blu-ray and a DVD, so everybody should buy it!  The Blu-ray looks splendid, and the DVD looks almost as good the Blu-ray.

The story centers on a group of people who all have dark secrets to hide.  A 20 year old female orphan is forced to move to a sinister home for wayward youth.  Suffice it to say that the adult caretakers are just as troubled as the young people in their care.  Murder and madness run rampant in this bizarre chiller.  Incredibly, it was rated PG in the early 1970's, which inspired the famous Psychotronic Encyclopedia to label it as ""one of the sickest PG films ever.""

Despite the gory poster art, this really isn't a splatter film.  It's more of a psychodrama that exposes greed, corruption, and exploitation-and comes with a wild surprise ending!",1436486400,7,954,4.7272727272727275
4961450,4,B0065QDKHS,"I would have given five stars to what is in my opinion, a great and very rare horror film of the Seventies.  The truth is, I'm a little disappointed with my purchase.  Though taken into consideration the film has never had a proper release, I expected to put the disc in and enjoy the film once more in a crisp, clear, widescreen format, such as when I once watched the film when Netflix had it streaming, and Amazon's instant stream.  What I got on this disc, was what appears to be an amateur attempt at digitally remastering a VHS transfer in Standard and not Widescreen format.  The film was a bit fuzzy, but still watchable and enjoyable.  I would compare the quality to something you'd find on a Mill Creek 100 movie box set.  A welcome addition to my movie collection, but I can only hope that one day they may sort out the issues which have prevented this film from seeing any legitimate distribution.  I'd love to see this film released on Blu Ray.",1434844800,2,957,4.434285714285714
4961451,2,B0065QDKHS,"Blood and Lace = 2 stars, /Slow moving//Some tense moments but no thrills. I don't recommend this to anyone unless you enjoy sleeping after 5 minutes into it. This is a boring, tedious movie. In a moment of feeling generous I gave it 2 stars.",1409270400,2,242,4.4

8493529,1,B0065QDKHS,"First off, I have to state how ridiculous it is how any bad horror film can get a Blu-Ray release and yet there are many notable films with only a DVD release available.

As for this movie, one might look at the cover art and think they're in for an awesome cult classic but in reality it's a poorly made film that I assumed looked outdated the day it was released. From the moment they showed two people in bed being killed with a hammer any viewer with dignity and self respect will lose interest right away because it all looks faker than an amateur porn star working on her fake orgasm for the very first time. The bloody hammer looks as if somebody dipped a paint brush in red paint and slapped it all over the hammer. As President Trump would say ""Sad.""

I cannot stress how poorly made this film is. When you watch it you really expect the characters of Mystery Science Theater 3000 to say something. And as for the twist ending, it all feels like shock value added at the very last second in order to have people walking out of the theater remembering the final 30-45 seconds of dialogue and not the rest of the film.

If you didn't see this film in 1971, it's doubtful you'll find anything here worth sitting through.",1486771200,,1226,4.344978165938865
8493530,4,B0065QDKHS,"This is probably the sleaziest and bloodiest film to ever receive a PG (or GP) rating. As I was watching it, all I could do is think about how the MPAA must have been napping when this film was submitted for a rating. The film open with an unseen killer murdering a women sleeping in bed with the claw end of a hammer (the imaginative POV shots are taken from the perspective of the hand holding the hammer) and then setting fire to the room. Ellie (Melody Patterson), the dead woman's wise-cracking daughter, looks to find out who killed her mother, even though she knows her mother was the town prostitute. Since Ellie is underage, she gets put in the orphanage run by Mrs. Deere (Gloria Grahame; THE NESTING - 1980), who receives a $150 a month stipend for every orphan she houses. That's all fine and dandy, until we find out that Mrs. Deere likes to spend the money on herself and leaves the orphans hungry most of the time and is not above killing those who try to run away. She simply puts their bodies in the basement freezer and puts them in the infirmary when the clueless Dr. Mullins (Milton Selzer) comes to visit to take his monthly head count. When Ellie arrives there, she almost immediately knows something wrong is going on (it doesn't help that she finds one poor girl chained up in the attic, dying of thirst). Ellie strikes up a friendship with fellow orphan Walter (Ronald Taft) and makes an enemy in female orphan Bunch (Terri Messina), who has a crush on Walter. Meanwhile, Tom (Len Lesser), the orphanage handyman, has just chopped-off the hand of a runaway orphan with a meat cleaver, which upsets Mrs. Deere. Not because he chopped-off the hand, but because the orphan got away! Mrs. Deere will do anything to keep collecting $150 per orphan. It doesn't matter if they are dead or alive, but she must have a body. As Ellie investigates further, she becomes aware of Mrs. Deere's evil doings and finds out that when the orphan supply becomes low, parents turn up dead in town. Is it possible that Mrs. Deere is responsible for Ellie's mother's death? If you think you have it figured out, think again.  The subject matter of this film is so slimy, you'll need to towel-off after watching it. Every adult in this film, including the film's part-time detective Calvin (Vic Tayback), who considers Ellie ""good breeding stock"", are portrayed as sleazy, conniving individuals who only care about their own satisfactions. When the killings begin, it plays like a mystery film with enough blood and guts to keep you asking yourself, ""Is this really rated PG or did someone screw-up royally?"" There's hammer and cleaver violence, attempted sexual assault, catfighting teens in their underwear, partial teen nudity, kids being tortured, implied incest, shots of open wounds bleeding and other politically incorrect doings going on. By the time the killer is unmasked (literally) in the film's finale, you'll be shaking your head in disbelief at some of the things you'll see and hear. This is the closest thing to PG-rated porn that you will ever see. In other words, if you haven't seen this, you should as soon as possible. Be on the lookout for a very young Dennis Christopher (FADE TO BLACK - 1980) as Pete, one of the unlucky orphans. Directed by one-hit wonder Philip S. Gilbert, who disappeared after making this. Maybe the orphans got him. Scripter Gil Lasky also wrote the screenplays for THE NIGHT GOD SCREAMED (1971), THE MANHANDLERS (1973) and MAMA'S DIRTY GIRLS (1974) and produced them all with then-partner Ed Carlin. Also starring Peter Armstrong and Maggie Corey. Future PSYCHO FROM TEXAS director Jim Feazell was an electrician on this. I got this off eBay on a DVD-R which was copied from and English language, Dutch-subtitled VHS tape. Rated PG. UPDATE: This film was finally released on home video for the first time in the United States by Scream Factory in a beautiful DVD/Blu-Ray Combo Pack. One caveat: Scream Factory slapped their own R-Rating on the packaging (there is no MPAA logo to be found anywhere), taking away one of the film's biggest pieces of notoriety. Since there is no extra footage (the film is in anamorphic widescreen), just commentary from film historian Richard Harland Smith, an alternate opening title card and a theatrical trailer, Scream Factory blew the chance of advertising this film as the bloodiest PG-Rated film ever made. Whomever decided to make this blunder should be fired immediately or face the person holding the bloody hammer.",1475107200,8,4506,4.821705426356589
8493531,5,B0065QDKHS,This movie has been terribly under-rated. I doubt that they even put it on VHS. I believe the movie to be a gem although it took several viewings for me to appreciate it.
