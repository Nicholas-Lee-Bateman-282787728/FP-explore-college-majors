Don't play, if you are my age(if you remember these episodes, you my age) and seriously disappointed with the crap wanna be comedy that is on TV today, collect you Robert Townsend and Def Comedy Jam before they disappear.  You will crack up all over again and remember where you seen the top comics first! HBO as always been revolutionary, Robert did just that with his Partners in Crime. GET IT!",1219104000,4,557,4.407766990291262
