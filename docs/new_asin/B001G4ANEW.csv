While I have no doubt that Gay is an excellent step-aerobics person, she is not a good instructor.  I have been doing step aerobics for the past 2-3 years and I have never had as many problems following along as I did with this one.  Now I am having to find a whole other DVD to try.",1265068800,,376,3.96
8303762,4,B001G4ANEW,"Gay Gasper has a great step workout for people who are not new to step. If you have read my other reviews on Step videos I will say that this is harder than Kathy Smith- Fat Burning Breakthrough featured in the Fat Burning Pilates DVD.  It is not as complex as the Reebok- Step Rhythm & Moves with Petra Kolber, or Cathe Friedrich Step Max. The set, current music and pace closely paralel the feel of a live class. The workout has a warmup, step choreography combos and a bonus combo where Gay Gasper blends the hardest parts of each of the previous combos into a choreography at a faster pace. The workout ends with a cool down and abs. I'm glad I bought this DVD, and will use it regularly.",1244505600,,692,4.282442748091603
