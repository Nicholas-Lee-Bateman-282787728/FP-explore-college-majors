3503251,5,B001BZ9GRG,"After watching it together once, my 4 years old have been asking to watch it again and again.  She was singing the 1,2,3.. song last night.
This is a real fun way to learn Chinese, and it's good to see a true edutainment product that's not another commercial for more dolls.
The real city and real cultural elements provides a more enriched learning experience.  The real photos of varies locations in China got my daughter asking to go to there on our next vacation.
This isn't just another Dora excercise, it opened my daughter's eye to a whole other world, that's actually real for a change.
I just wish there are more in the series.",1220140800,,636,4.521739130434782
3503252,5,B001BZ9GRG,"My children love this video, and want to watch it over and over. They sing along with the numbers and can now count to 10 in Mandarin. They know how to ask for a red apple, and they love the voices and the story. My children were very interested in China after seeing beautiful images of it during the Olympic coverage. It's so important for young children to hear the sounds of other languages even if they are not fluent. We also use the BBC Muzzy in Spanish and Lyric Language, but this format is more fun and accessible. We're keeping our fingers crossed for more episodes in the future.",1220140800,4,591,4.381818181818182
3503253,5,B001BZ9GRG,"My daughters both seem entranced by the video.  Takes a little while for the video to get going, but once they're into it, they are hooked.

I like that this has more chinese content than Nickelodeon's Ni Hao Kai-Lan.  It's got some Dora-like animation/story telling, but it has much more emphasis on the actual mandarin learning part.  Which is good in my opinion.

The video teaches basic chinese terms for certain colors, body parts, and numbers.  My daughters have picked up quite a few terms already.  Sometimes, I just let the video run as my kids seem to be able to watch it several times in a row.  The video also shows the chinese characters/words on-screen...so I'm learning some chinese too.

Overall, thumbs up!",1219881600,4,723,4.766129032258065
3503254,4,B001BZ9GRG,"My kids enjoy this, but I find the voices and songs annoying.

HOWEVER, there are tons of vocab words and they teach them quite effectively. My 3.5 year old has learned them all after viewing this video probably 10-20 times. He does have a few other occasional Chinese influences though my husband and I do not speak Chinese. If they come out with another video I will definitely buy it.

one note: the River Dragon King is a Chinese god and his temple and offerings are involved in the story so if that's not part of your religion you may want to skip this video or prep yourself to answer questions.",1372032000,,601,4.405405405405405
3503255,1,B001BZ9GRG,"I thought this might be a good addition to our library of exclusively mandarin movies/videos for our kids who are learning mandarin in mandarin immersion preschool, or who are being exposed to mandarin via a childcare person.

I was wrong.  This video is mostly english with some effort at learning mandarin words. But for our kids at least videos that are more entertaining and completely Mandarin are much better.  At this age all videos are entertaining - so you don't need to have the english for them to watch it, and if the kids are already being exposed to mandarin from a caregiver or teacher - they've heard the words before and you're just helping to reinforce it with a video that is enjoyable and entertaining.  Much better to go with the Mandarin Editions of popular movies like Toy Story, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, or videos from Sesame Street etc. - as you can find here on Amazon in the Babylon Media store, or on other web sites.

I've also read research that suggests that if you mix english with the foreign language you're trying to teach - you actually make it harder for kids to understand that there are two distinct languages (think about it - if they hear English and Mandarin how are they supposed to know that there are two distinct languages being learned  - and not just one with new words.

My advice - skip it.  Go for the full Mandarin experience and skip these half steps.",1361318400,8,1424,4.600790513833992

3503260,2,B001BZ9GRG,"The idea is OK, but the presentation fails.
The voice of the River Dragon King is terrible. It's way too much computerized.
We've watched this in a full HD TV with built-in speakers, in two different computers, and in another full HD TV with 7.1 sound system with lots of options but the voices of the characters (thus the pronunciation) are not good.

It was still OK for me because I can understand Chinese but my little one got bored.

I recommend Ni Hao, Kai-Lan. Easy to follow, and attractive for a toddler.",1328054400,,513,4.505376344086022
3503261,5,B001BZ9GRG,"Results speak for themselves. My young son picked everything up over the course of 2-3 weeks. He can pronounce all the words and he knows what they mean. This is the only video my two children want to watch in the car now. The only problem is that this is the only video by this company, so Im going to need to try out some of the other childrens videos which don't seem to get as good reviews.",1310342400,,394,4.064102564102564

After a pause for reflection 'of how shocked I was,' I replied, ""No, but Mommy will buy you the video.""  After a search of other store's websites, I choose this video on amazon.  The day it came in the mail, she watched it three times in a row.  She even got her Daddy saying some Chinese words.  The songs are very 'catchy.'  She is very tickled with her purchase.",1299542400,,453,4.149425287356322
3503263,1,B001BZ9GRG,"The pronunciation is poor and inconsistent between speakers.  The voice ""acting"" is indifferent even annoying as others have mentioned.  The animation is bare.  Many words are mentioned once or twice and show on the screen for less than a second each time.

I don't see how children could be getting the tones right from listening to this video.

Oh, and my children 3 and 5 are afraid of the ""River Dragon King"" character.  The voice is creepily flat.  Western children are not familiar with the Chinese imagery for ""gods"" and it ends up looking like a scary blue devil or something (which to some sense these animist gods are).",1291075200,5,629,4.715596330275229
3503264,2,B001BZ9GRG,"I purchased this video for my 2-year-old to give her more exposure to Chinese.  The video is a decent, if limitted and non-immersive language lesson, but the production values leave much to be desired.  Honestly, aside from the language lesson structure, it looks and sounds like something a ten year old would put together.  The animation is of poor quality, and while the voice actors pronouce everything correctly, their delivery is completely without affect and just plain annoying.  Also, the video is only just over half an hour long.  I was expecting a bit more.",1286150400,5,569,4.947368421052632
3503265,5,B001BZ9GRG,"She was learning Mandarin Chinese and loved this book.  If your child is interested in Chinese, it is a very difficult language to learn.  Doable but takes patience and time.",1283472000,,174,4.766666666666667
3503266,5,B001BZ9GRG,"I really like the video.

It understands that when the kids don't know Chinese, you may have to talk in English first, build up a good story, then, little by little, add Chinese to it, may be just one word at a time, but you will keep the children's attention.

Very clear and standard pronunciation.

Lovely animation.

I will buy more once my kids master the first one.",1282608000,,371,4.411764705882353
3503267,5,B001BZ9GRG,I am very happy and impressed with this DVD.  My 5 yr old and 3 yr old love this.  I also bought them Let's Go Guang and I would say they seem to love both equally.  They are using the language in their everyday conversation and seem to be retaining very well.  I wish there were more of these DVDs.  It's been such a good influence on them.  Also love that it includes the Chinese culture.,1279929600,,390,4.065789473684211
3503268,5,B001BZ9GRG,this dvd is very good! didn't notice any flaws in it whatsoever. clear speech pronunciation and excellent catchy songs. it even gives your child a brief history lesson on the pictures used during the course. we are hoping this company will produce more quality lessons. well worth every penny!,1266019200,,293,5.0
3503269,5,B001BZ9GRG,"We adopted our daughter from China in March 2008 and in December she will be 3.  We wanted her to learn Chinese but they don't teach it in our area until she is 5 and we didn't want to wait that long.  We ordered Journeys to the East-The River Dragon King and she loves it.  It has the numbers, food, body parts,colors and short phrases in Chinese.  In the first week of watching the video she has already learned about 6 words. She is even correcting me in the pronunciation of the words.  She seems to know the exact dialect of how the words are suppose to be spoken. This is a super video and I hope they come out with more.",1257897600,4,627,4.10655737704918

3503271,5,B001BZ9GRG,"My 5-year-old and 3-year-old love the DVD. They have picked up quite a few simple phrases and use them during day-to-day activities.

This DVD's purpose is education first and entertainment second. The producers don't have the production $$$ that Nick Jr. has with Kai Lan, but your children will learn much more from this DVD than any Kai Lan DVD released to date.

I am very satisfied with this purchase.",1253923200,5,406,4.785714285714286
3503272,5,B001BZ9GRG,"My kids and I are learning Chinese for fun and this show has us chattering in Chinese quite a bit. It links vocabulary on food, parts of the body, and useful phrases such as ""let's go..(do this)"" and ""faster!"" and ""please have some..."" The English voices are slightly odd, I think it's just the result of using untrained actors, but you really get a feel for Chinese tones.",1252886400,2,373,4.5
3503273,4,B001BZ9GRG,"My kids really love this DVD.  There is not such a good range of Chinese language learning DVDs for children available in the UK, so I had to buy this from the US site.  It works (most of the time) with my elderly multi-region DVD player, but a Region 2 / PAL version would be very welcome!

But, it's good value when compared with equivalent DVDs available in Europe, even with the postage costs added in.  The story and structure will be familiar to anyone who has seen Dora the Explorer, and the production seems very professional and high quality.  My 2 and 6 year olds can now name colours, fruit and like to sing the Fei Ying flying cloud song.  My 2 year old particularly loves it, but it seems to keep them both entertained, and they do seem to be picking up some Chinese too.

Looking forward to the next adventure - and hopefully a multi-region DVD release!",1252627200,,867,4.38125
3503274,4,B001BZ9GRG,"We now have one of each of the more popular Chinese language DVD programs on Amazon (Little Pim, Mei Mei, Follow Jade, Kai-Lan) including this title.  What makes it outstanding is that individual words/objects introduced at the start of the story are integrated into full sentences by the end of the story.  There are multiple ways to practice the new words which make it fun and memorable.  The Play & Learn with Mei Mei #1 also introduced sentences but was inconsistent about explaining all the additional words.  The (English/Chinese) subtitling in JTTE are very handy, are accurate, and consistent.

For future DVDs in the series, I'd ask that they modify or exclude song sequences like the one that the River Dragon God sings.  It's just awful to hear IMHO.  <grin>  There is also at least one very notable difference in pronunciation (""er"") between this program and all the others I've seen.  I'm a native-Cantonese speaker though (not Mandarin) so I can only assume that perhaps these voices hail from different parts of China/Taiwan?

Anyways, it has a nice story formula that has worked well in video games and classic Chinese stories.  I couldn't help playing along out loud.",1250294400,27,1185,4.934343434343434
3503275,2,B001BZ9GRG,"Our 2 year old enjoys this, and it does go over body parts, a couple of colors and fruits, but geez the kids' voices are annoying. The songs also sound like someone is making them up on the fly. There is a lot of repetition, though, good for little kids.",1247097600,7,254,4.1
3503276,3,B001BZ9GRG,"It's really wonderful that more videos now exist to teach Chinese to Children.  ""Journeys to the East"" is better than Mei Mei's Learn Chinese Video but lacks Ni Hao Kai-Lan's animation quality.  I think it needs to be more engaging to watch and less classroom like.  After all, learning a new language should be fun!",1245456000,3,316,4.709090909090909
3503277,4,B001BZ9GRG,"I purchased this DVD to introduce my 3 year old daughter to Chinese.  She likes it.  It is an effective tool for presenting the sounds of the Chinese language but your child will not learn Chinese from repeated viewings. I have also purchased the Muzzy program in French at $120.  Regardless of marketing, neither Muzzy nor Journeys to the East will teach your child a foreign language.  But they are both more useful than an hour watching Dora the Explorer.  For the money, Journeys to the East actaully exceeded my expectations. And, although there really are no functional alternatives to actually learn a language from a single DVD, you can do better than the crap kid shows they broadcast in order to sell cereal.",1237420800,9,718,4.758064516129032
3503278,5,B001BZ9GRG,"Journeys to the east ""The river dragon king"" had my 2 year old son speaking some mandaring words on the first day he watched it.  The songs are catchy and emphasize the words being taught.

We bought ""The adventures of Walker & PingPing"" and ""Ni Hao Kai-Lan: Super Special..."" and both of these videos paled compared to ""river dragon king"" in the amount of vocabulary words taught and length of the video.

If you're seriously trying to get your child to learn basic Mandarin while having fun this is the video for them.

3503279,5,B001BZ9GRG,My daughter is 18 months old and has been listening to Mandarin CD's in the car since she was about 4 months old.  I purchased this CD for Christmas and after watching it a couple of times.  My daughter started to count in Mandarin.  I was surprised and then thought back to the songs.  I guess this DVD put it all together for her.  It's a great tool if you are looking to introduce your child to Mandarin.  I can't wait for them to produce additional DVD's.  I'm learning a bit of Mandarin also.,1232236800,4,497,4.223404255319149
3503280,5,B001BZ9GRG,Fantastic! It is fashioned after Dora the Explorer in the storyline presentation. This is nice because it lends familiarity to your little one. Great fun for learning Chinese for the entire family!,1224633600,,197,5.1875
3503281,5,B001BZ9GRG,"Although this DVD is for kids 3 and up, my two-year-old daughter certainly enjoys watching it and has learned quite a few words and phrases from it! My husband and I are also very impressed with this DVD. First, the storyline is very interesting, which holds my daughter's attention (and our attention). Plus, it's very interactive and engaging, getting kids involved in counting and naming body parts, colors, and fruits. Second, the characters are very appealing. It introduces positive role models that inspire kids to speak Chinese. Third, it utilizes several fun sing-along songs that reinforce new words and phrases. My daughter loves these tunes so much; she would sing them over and over. We've also tried to use these songs to teach her other new words. Fourth, the Chinese text is up on the screen, which helps kids to learn Chinese characters as well. Finally, we like the words review in the end and the introduction of Chinese culture and ancient capital city. As a Mandarin speaker myself, I highly recommend this DVD!",1222473600,21,1032,4.936781609195402
3503282,5,B001BZ9GRG,"As I'm trying to teach my son Chinese, the amount of Chinese vocabulary in a Chinese learning DVD is very important to me. With Journey to the East, I'm very impressed with the 50+ Chinese words in this video, which is much more than other videos on the market. In order for children to learn Chinese, they need to be exposed to as much Chinese as possible. The catchy songs and the fun adventure story also help greatly to interest my 3.5 year old son. He smiles whenever the songs start, and started humming them after only one viewing of the video. We were also able to discuss Chinese history when watching the part about Luo Yang and Terra Cotta Warrior. My father is from a city very close to Luo Yang, and we almost visited last time when we were in China. So it gave me a great chance to talk to my son about it, and got him all interested about his family's history.",1221350400,7,875,4.27710843373494

The bright colors and pleasant narrative vices get a child's attention and keeps it. If you are interested in your child learning basic phrases and songs in another language than this is a great choice to get them on the path to learning a new language.

Pros:
-The repetition is great.  By the end of your first watching you'll know how to say something.
-The accents seem very good
-The brother and sister are great voice actors and sound happy

Cons:
-The voice of the Dragon King is awful, it's so low and he can't sing and is to motorized sounding rather than rhythmical.  His voice alone makes me want to just turn the DVD off.
