Aftab Shivdasani - He shreds the cute-dimple-boy-next-door look for the role and handles his character extremely well. This is one powerful performance. Its high time he works with bigger film-makers who can do justice to his talent.
The biggest positive of Red is its run time which thankfully is just about 1 hour and 45 mins. Also Aftab Shivdhasani carries the movie on his shoulders.",1304640000,,423,5.235294117647059
