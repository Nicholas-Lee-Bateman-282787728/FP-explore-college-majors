8353141,1,B0026LYM3C,"This is a warning! For anyone expecting to receive a disc with the two films advertised, 'Atom Age Vampire' with restored footage (which is why I purchased this in the first place), and 'Last Man On Earth', DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DISC. It really contains ""Count Dracula & His Vampire Brides' aka 'Satanic Rites of Dracula', Hammer Films' penultimate and totally awful Dracula movie.  This probably means that Vol. 4 of this series (where Vampire Brides is SUPPOSED to be), may not be correct either. To make matters worse, I can't really locate a website or e-mail address for Microwerks to even ask about the goof! Just get your money back, it's easier!",1246406400,5,652,4.769911504424779
