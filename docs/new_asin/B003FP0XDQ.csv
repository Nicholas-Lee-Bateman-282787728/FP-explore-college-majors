8396048,4,B003FP0XDQ,An important figure in the Pop-Surreal/Low Brow movement and 90's underground music scene. I got it to see the Todd Schoor shirt film on his working of the painting on the cover. Well worth it.,1404000000,,193,4.542857142857143

See them all tied together by the hand and mind and imagination of one man- Long Gone John!,1378684800,,309,5.078431372549019
8396051,5,B003FP0XDQ,"GREAT documentary, not just about LGJ, but also about the L.A. scene pertaining to an excellent aspect and mix of culture, art and music.

Worth it for the interviews, art and certainly the super cool animated effects.  Learned a lot (more) about Sympathy for the Record Industry, designer vinyl toys, the Poubelle Twins, Camille Rose Garcia and Candypants, not necessarily in that order.

A must have for those with the interest or affliction.",1369008000,,444,5.054794520547945
8396052,1,B003FP0XDQ,"Not knowing John other then what his family says about him, I found this a worthless bit of self promotion and all around self serving. A Self centered man with a child like addiction to hording worthless items for no logical reason.",1359331200,,233,4.571428571428571
8396053,5,B003FP0XDQ,"Meet your favorite artists as seen in Juxtapose Magazine. I knew of Long Gone John due to his Sympathy for the Record Industry record label. I had purchased many vinyl  records from him just for the art work on the covers.
The real gem of this video though is seeing the group Candypants perform. I tracked down a MP3 download at Amazon.com. I can't get enough of the cute singer's pure voice with the band's precise happening playing.",1347840000,,435,4.576923076923077
