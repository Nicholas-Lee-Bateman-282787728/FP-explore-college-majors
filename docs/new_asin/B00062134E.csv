2158709,4,B00062134E,"This is not a grand disaster film, but one that will force the viewer to wonder how (s)he would act if everything broke down.  Nothing is explained, nothing is tied off, nothing resolved.  Instead, the film focuses on seemingly mundane details with a chilling realism, moving from character to character without conclusion. Still, there are characters that one can follow through the film, with whom the viewer identifies and hopes, to a degree.  They are all flawed, hence frighteningly human, seeking water, sex, security, power.  The realism and pessimism are palpable and believable.

This is another of those art house films that you will want to see only once.  It is agonizing and cannot be re-viewed.  No redemption, no progress, just the naked horror of those trying to cope and survive an unnamed disaster, perhaps a breakdown, perhaps the end of the world, with burning masses of infected cattle and the end of all order, personal and in community.

REcommended, as a season in hell.",1263686400,,994,4.9818181818181815

They demand for supplies, food and water. They run away in pursuit of shelter. But once they arrive they will realize the crude and sinister state of things where to survive is the rule.

The title of ""Time of wolves"" makes reference to a brief passage of ""Codex regius"" an Icelandic poem dated from the XII Century in whose context refers to the preceding age of the end of world, a previous reference that Ingmar Bergman used in ""The hour of the wolf"" in 1967.
 Michael Haneke's camera handle is always distant, like if the eye-camera was a scared witness of this frightening script. The social struggling between the families, the drama of the mother whose son is seriously ill, the hopeless of the children and the desperation of the mature people conform a weird and bitter experience about what it means to live in such deplorable conditions.

For many people, this film may be weird because of the fact the tension is inner. There are not special effects and even more devastating sequences. In many aspects this project reminded me to Tarkovsky's Sacrifice: disturbing and horrid movie. Watch for the last take from the train in movement. Dark poetry in its highest level.",1255478400,,1357,4.717299578059071
2158711,2,B00062134E,"Isabelle Huppert is a French mother whose family has fled the city following an unnamed apocalypse.  The family arrives at their country home and discovers that another family has commandeered it.  They seek shelter and eventually came across a teen boy who leads them to a train station.  They join a group of others waiting for the next train, which they hope will take them to safety or provide them with supplies.  As they wait, they grow more hopeless.

""Time of the Wolf"" is a bleak movie, made in a minimalist style by French director Michael Haneke (Cache, Funny Games).  The family's experiences are horrendous.  Unfortunately, the main characters are so mute and distant that it greatly diminishes the impact of their suffering.  The only affecting part to me was the budding relationship between the daughter and the wild teen boy.  The boy is pessimistic and stubborn, and the daughter struggles to understand him.  However, this subplot isn't enough to sustain the movie.  The ambiguous ending is typical of Haneke and is likely to delight fans of his work and frustrate others.  The movie was too boring and aloof for me to care much at that point.",1234656000,,1162,4.842639593908629

2158713,5,B00062134E,"Note: This review may contain what you consider spoilers. Skip if that doesn't float your review boat--

Yesterday, I caught a film from 2002, French with subtitles, called Le Temps Du Loup: THE TIME OF THE WOLF.

It's a difficult film to watch, but I found myself utterly engrossed. There is no way I could turn off this film after the harrowing opening scene grabbed me completely:

A family of four, the Laurents, drive to their country home--mom, dad, son, daughter. Upon entering their cottage, they find that another family is squatting there: a man, his wife, and a boy. They are grim-faced and the man raises his rifle to the Laurents. As Mr. Laurent tries to be reasonable, speaking calmly, offering to share his food and water with the family, to work something out, the squatter shoots Laurent. We see blood splatter on the wife's face, played by Isabel Huppert.

The squatters take the supplies and cast the woman and children off with only a can of juice, some biscuits, what they are wearing and carrying in the mother's purse, and a bicycle.

Then we see the stricken woman-who is clearly in shock--visit the magistrate. He refuses to help--Don't you know what's happened? he says--and tells her to go away. Closes his door on the bereaved threesome. They knock on neighbor's doors in the village. None will open to her.

We know something is very, very wrong. She knows their names. They've been her neighbors for years. But none will let them in out of the cold night.

Yes, something is wrong, very wrong.

This is a film in the tradition of the post-apocalyptic story. Some sort of plague has hit this country (seems like France, but one could assume the wider world is stricken, at minimum Europe). Water is scarce. Food supplies are not moving as they used to. Animals are affected and being burned. Hunger is rampant. Trains don't stop for passengers.

And now this family must find a way to survive without supplies, in the cold, without their Pater Familias, and with a terrible grief to bear.

It's enough to break your heart, this chilling opening.

The story follows them as they meet up with a filthy, feral youth--a boy who is a loner, who steals to survive, who will not join up with a group, but lives in the woods in solitary suspiciousness and pessimissm. The misanthropic survivalist. Then they meet up with a quarrelsome group at a train station. They hope a train will come. (At this point, it starts to feel as if WAITING FOR GODOT has become a horrifying sci-fi story, because we can only wonder if a train ever WILL come, and if they wait in vain.)

Terrible things are done. Amazingly kind things are done. Hope is minimal, but not completely lost. Some people try to keep things civilized, to be fair. More terrible losses are in store.

I watched, mesmerized, horrified. I wondered: What would I do with MY back against the wall? Would I be like the kinder folks, and would I comfort and share? Or would I be one of the ""me and mine"" folks, and cast out the wanderer for pragmatic and selfish reasons? Would I withhold water from a thirsting woman or child today, just to be able to give it to my own tomorrow? Would I succumb to survival of the fittest or the cruelest or the one with the biggest rifle?

I hope not. I hope that grace will abound. That this film made me stop and consider my own soul, well, that tells me it's powerful and worthy.

But I do NOT know the anwer. I do not comfort myself with thinking I will be among the great and giving righteous on that day. I can only pray I will.

Part of the ongoing imagery in story and action and dialogue in the film harkens to the idea of the 35 Righteous of Jewish legend. Those 36 people who, by virtue of being on the planet and being of such goodness, that they keep the world from being destroyed. (Think of the story of Abraham's pleading for Sodom, how God could not really destroy a city with even TEN righteous souls in it, would he?)

And as if to prove that there is something to this, we see a woman bring a bit of warm goat milk to a very old man, who in turn takes not one sip, but gives it ALL to his frail wife, who drinks it up in silence, him holding the bowl to her lips.

And we see a woman offer to give up her bicycle, another to give up his watch, to get water for a woman with nothing left to trade except sex.

And we see an addled, shocked, silent boy ready to make the ultimate, horrific sacrifice if it will save the world.

Even in the midst of the selfish and murderous and quarrelsome, a few lights shine.

The movie is named after an era spoken of in Norse legend, the wolf-age, the time of the wolf. The age that precedes the end of the world. These lines are from the Norse poem VOLUPSA:

Brother will fight brother and be his slayer,
brother and sister will violate the bonds of kinship;
hard it is in the world, there is much adultery,
axe-age, sword-age, shields are cleft asunder,
wind-age, wolf-age, before the world plunges headlong;
no man will spare another.

These words are compatible with what we read in the eschatalogical writings of Judaism and Christianity. (Perhaps Islam, too, but I am not as familiar with those texts.)

I was very moved by this dark and depressing film, and grateful that the director gave us some light in the darkness, the light that came through acts of generosity and selflessness, no matter how scarce when catastrophe and chaos comes.

If you can bear it, I recommend LE TEMPS DU LOUP/THE TIME OF THE WOLF. It's not easy to watch, but I think there are lessons there worth viewing, and some very good scenes. And Isabel Huppert is, to me, always a delight to watch.

2158714,4,B00062134E,Michael Hanecke is one of my new favorite directors - with portraits like the piano teacher and cache - he has become one of the heavy-hitters of world cinema.. 'Time of the wolf' is perhaps his most unnerving and his most timely and relevant venture to date... It inhabits  a post-apocolyptic world which somewhat reminds me of Bergman's 'shame' and Tarkovsky's the 'sacrifice'.. But this is something new at the same time.. Hanecke raises even more questions than he answers.. the characters are even more aloof and deranged.. This is a kind of warning to our modern world - we can't escape from our own humanity afterall.,1169942400,,624,4.831775700934579

i tried to watch palm pictures' video release ""time of the wolf"" tonight and found myself deeply shocked and utterly sickened at what i saw.  the part of this movie which deeply offended and revolted me is the one in which a horse is brutally slaughtered on camera.  although i was not there--thankfully--i believe that what i saw in that scene was the actual slaughtering of a living creature.  the sight of the horse's eyes as the that huge knife was plunged deep into into its chest and then again when it was used to cut its throat open...and the geyser of blood that erupted from it...i cannot find the words to describe it.  this is without a doubt the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed in a movie.  please do not simply tell me that it had to be all just movie magic.  i dare you to watch that scene and then tell me that.  i've seen hundreds of movies, and i've seen animals slaughtered before, and this looked like an animal slaughter to me.  this creature had to have its throat punctured and sliced to satisfy the director's ""vision""?

All of the deep anguish and philosophical statements Haneke may have been trying to convey were too vague, buried too deep in the long shots across foggy fields and depressed faces of traumatized people. The lack of dialogue didn't help the viewer understand what is going on. A much better movie on the topic of how humans deal with the shock and suffering of a near-apocalyptic event, set in the same beautiful natural context, is Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Stalker"".",1118188800,,559,4.957446808510638
2158717,4,B00062134E,"The Time of the Wolf reunites director Michael Haneke and actress Isabelle Huppert in this movie about what a family must cope with in the aftermath of an apocalyptic event. It begins when a family comes home to find another family has invaded their house. The man of the house is shot to death, and the mother (Isabelle Huppert) and her two children, Eva and Ben are forced to leave. The family must cope alone, homeless, as they have no one who can help them. They end up living with other stranded people in what looks like an old factory building. Tempers flare and personalities collide. There is a touching scene in which Eva, the daughter, writes a letter addressed to her dead father. Things get heated and emotional when Eva and her mother are confronted with the man who killed their father/husband. He denies it, so it's a matter of their word against his. All in all, this isn't the easiest movie in the world to watch. There is a gory scene involving a horse, and the near suicide of the mother's son, Ben. But this movie deals with an important topic: how people might cope when confronted with an apocalyptic event. This obviously isn't a glamour role for Isabelle, but the part of Anne seems to suit her very well. In every movie she gives her best, and that is very very good.

2158719,5,B00062134E,"Time of the Wolf (Le Temps du Loup) begins with an opening similar to Funny Games, also by Michael Haneke, where a family arrives to their vacation home where they are brutalized.  The story is focused on the distressed Anna (Isabelle Huppert) and her two children, Ben and Eva, in a fallen civilization where they have to survive.  However, the naive mother Anna slowly comes to the realization that there is no one willing to help them with their basic needs: water, food, and shelter.  Disheartened the family continues to drift as they eventually find shelter in a small barn, but when Ben disappears they accidentally burn it down and they are once again without shelter.  These catastrophic events continue with further predicaments as there seems to be no end to the family's suffering.  The dark atmosphere grows gloomier as people exhibit xenophobia and extreme cynicism that colors radical religious beliefs in a tribal environment.  This tribal environment becomes a foundation where women's rights regress to having minimal meaning such as when they must trade their body for what they need in order to survive.  All these miserable events sum up the ending where the disturbing finale functions like a Phoenix raising from ashes.

Time of the Wolf is based on an ancient German poem about the time before the end of the world.  This is not an exclusively German myth as folklore from the Vikings and Celts also associated the wolf with destruction and doom.  In Time of the Wolf the director Haneke brings his vision of a present day apocalypse where the dark despair is brought to the audience in several ways.  The opening credits begin with this darkness displayed on a black background without sound or music.  The silence is overwhelming as the entire film has no score or background music that would bring some sort of emotion to the audience.  The only time the audience can hear music is when Eva hears and listens to a small tape recorder, but even then it is hushed.  The ancient myths of the day of reckoning convey a message of devastating darkness as the sun will end it's shining.  Overall, Time of the Wolf is a remarkable cinematic experience as the audience cannot escape Haneke's dark vision where themes such as solidarity, hope, friendship, and much more is questioned.  After Time of the Wolf the distributors need to release Benny's Video and The Seventh Continent, which are excellent films as well.",1104451200,,2435,4.87378640776699

8036751,5,B00062134E,"This is a movie about an unknown apocalyptic catastrophy and its impact on a family, people around them, and the region.  Produced in France, I have no doubt the Producer attempts to demonstrate the emotional trauma, physical deprivations and the challenges to survive.  The only transportation available is the railroad trains.  People move to the train terminal.  Some individuals have a radio with batteries which received broadcasts about the problem of supplies for survivors.  A family went to the country, squatters took over their cabin, the Father is murdered, the squatters take their car, food and supplies.  The family with a Mother, teenage daughter and 12 year old Son are turned out with a bicycle, walked to a town and ended up at a railroad terminal with other survivors.  To survive, killing horses for food, trading jewelry or valuables for uncontaminated water, and other attempts reveal the destitute situation.  Babies, children and people die due to the lack of medical care and medicines.  At the end of the movie, the 12 year old boy goes to a fire on the railroad track.  The boy is suffering from an uncontrolled nose bleed which is a common symptom of starvation.  With the loss of his Father and possible death pending the boy becomes hysterical, takes off all of his
clothes, and completely nude starts to throw himself in the bonfire.  A man observes him, intervenes and stops the boy from killing himself.  Then, the movie ends with a landscape passing by as some kind of symbolic invocation of hope.  This French film is an intense psycho-drama of the
real traumas in a devastating disaster.  In that context it is outstanding.",1436832000,,1660,4.920863309352518

8036753,3,B00062134E,"French director/screenwriter Michael Haneke, as he did with ""White Ribbon (2009) and ""Amour"" (2012), provides a glimpse of what might come later in this depressing, if perhaps accurate, post-apocalyptical future.  We don't ever learn what happened but with contaminated water, a nuke would be likely.

Set in France, the Laurent family, from the ""city,"" have escaped to the country where they own a cottage.  Upon arrival, the house is occupied by another family.  Before a compromise is worked out, the patriarch is shot and killed by the squatters.  Allowed to leave, the mother, Anne (Isabelle Huppert) with her daughter Eva (Anais Demoustier), about 13 and son, Ben (Lucas Biscombe), about 10, start walking.  After a couple restless and frightening nights, they stumble upon a boy about 15 (Hakim Taleb) who guides them to a building adjacent to a working railroad.  They hope to stop the train which would shuttle them to a safer environment.

The small camp is occupied by similarly distressed people.  They have little to drink, eat or to barter with.  A village nearby is run by thugs who trade essentials (water) for material items.  The film focuses on the Laurents although Anne is fairly overcome by the events, especially losing her husband.  She is ill-prepared to take care of herself or the kids.  Ben is fragile as well, having lost his pet parakeet and having a constantly bleeding nose.  Eva is growing up quickly and frankly, the best scenes are between her and the young runaway boy.  She is looking for a friend but he is distant and afraid of the controlling group.

The film isn't breaking new ground, but is another example of possible social interaction where we quickly learn that man is just another animal.  The film is well made if a little dreary.  I can't say that I was ever invested in the characters, except for Eva and that there is never any resolution to it all.",1410739200,,1901,4.8328173374613
8036754,4,B00062134E,"This is ""the time of the wolf"" in the sense that ""the wolf is at the door."" This is, of course, an old saying indicating that things are desperate. I am beginning with this for the benefit of anyone whose first thought is that this is a werewolf movie. That was my first impression at seeing the title and cover art. It is not a werewolf movie, nor is there any actual wolf of any kind in the movie. But times are desperate thus ""the wolf is at the door,"" and times are desperate everywhere thus it is the ""Time of the Wolf.""

This movie reminds me of a book series I recently reviewed on Amazon.com. In my review of ""Sinking Sand; Grab the Pole"", the first book of the series, I wrote:
""This is not your typical postapocalypic story:
First of all there is less physical destruction to the earth than in most postapocalypic stories. Worldwide terrorism attacks toppled the world governments, followed by a few months of total chaos...""

This movie does not explain anything about the apocalyptic event, but could easily be France during the first month or two after the attacks refereed to in the above referenced book series. One other similarity between the book series and this movie is that both focus on interpersonal relationships in the horrendous situation. That is, however, as far as the similarity goes; the stories move in separate ways with these major themes. But then America and France would probably move in different directions after such an event.
This movie follows one family during this time when civilization is crumbling and total chaos is a looming possibility. At least in the area where the movie is set law enforcement does not exist, utilities are off, fuel is running low, the water is contaminated, the monetary system has given away to bartering, and theft and violence are rising. Tempers are flaring and accusations are flying.
This movie is dark, both in theme and in overall lighting and effects. Little is explained as the movie progresses, which helps with the overall mood of mystery and suspense, but personally I would have preferred a little more explanation in some scenes. Also there are a few scenes where the English subtitles do not translate everything. The non-translated French is not critical to the plot but since the original French audience had the benefit of understanding it, I think the English audience should be allowed to understand it also. But these minor complaints were not enough to prevent me from enjoying this drama.
This movie has a short nude scene in it. One of the boys builds up a fire and then strips nude in front of it. The whole time the boy is seen nude he is between the camera and the fire and thus he is in a way clothed in darkness, you only see a silhouette while he has his back to the camera, and when he turns around, even though the lighting improves slightly, the camera backs off reducing his size on the screen.

I'll tell ya, I didn't get it. I wouldn't compare this even remotely to ""The Road"". A vague, unexplained catastrophe occurs that leaves society in a shambles, though there's no visual evidence of destruction or cause. It's more of a morality play on how people react to calamity though there's no plot, sparse dialogue and no real resolution. The movie starts, stuff happens and then it ends with nothing compelling in the interim to make you even care about any of the characters after the first few minutes. Maybe if I spoke, understood or thought in French (the films native language) I might find some understanding to the films purpose. It's not SciFi, barely qualifies as good dystopian or post apocalyptic genre and the events could have taken place after a tour bus full of people broke down on the side of the road in some remote area and their reactions while waiting for the tow truck (food and water running out and tempers flairing).

It begins with an incident very much like the one in Haneke's Funny Games, but it quickly turns into an end of the world movie like The Road. Like The Road, we are not told what caused the disaster we see, but unlike The Road we do not see a devastated landscape. We see green fields, trees, roads and trains, but the actions of the people in the film indicate that something very bad has happened. Obviously western civilization has suffered a serious disaster, but like The Road we are not told what it was.
As in his other films, Haneke withholds information to force the viewer to come up with own conclusions. He shows fragments and we have to complete the movie. In a way, Time of the Wolf seems more realistic then The Road because it is hard to conceive of a world totally devastated except in the far future.

Perhaps I'm inviting those who have thought so little of this film to review it from the perspective of a crumbling world.

For all these, I realize this is a film akin to a bad dream.  To all these I say, take a look at what we have been through in the past few years and think that the wonder that keeps the whole thing going, more or less within the same parameters despite the shocks, can lose its magic.
