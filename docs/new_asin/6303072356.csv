545903,5,6303072356,"Amazon has such great prices on the oldies and still goodies. Francis us a great movie for all ages, I thought about it the other day, so I looked it up on Amazon and sure enough there it was. No cusing no nudit when the kids walk in the room. Just great laugh's and fun. Will be going back to look for more.",1346544000,4,308,3.9047619047619047

545905,5,6303072356,I watched these movies when I was growing up on TV. They would be shown on weekends. Watch them for fun. We have forgotten what classic comedy once was.,1280707200,2,152,4.275862068965517
545906,4,6303072356,"Peter Stirling (Donald O'Connor) is a former bank clerk turned soldier who finds himself cast in role of reluctant hero when he strikes up a friendship with Francis, an Army mule who can talk (voiced by Chill Wills, and played by a female named Molly). Ala Cyrano de Bergerac, Francis helps Peter to win the girl of his dreams, a shapely nurse named Patricia (Maureen Gelder). Unfortunately, the stubborn mule thinks mum's the word whenever Peter tries to tell others of the critter's gift of gab: This sends Peter to the psych ward more than once, where he becomes an expert basket-weaver. Several sequels kicked the Francis franchise into high gear, making for a memorably fun series of silly and cute family films. Based upon a novel by David Stern.

545907,4,6303072356,"Although these films were made five years apart, the later one is loaded with references to the earlier one, making this a fine double bill. FRANCIS has soldier Donald O'Connor vainly trying to convince his superior officers that he knows a mule that talks. The gimmick is a good one (the director later worked on TV's ""Mister Ed""), and it's an enjoyable movie. FRANCIS JOINS THE WACS is even funnier, with O'Connor recalled to duty but in the Women's Army Corps. O'Connor plays the mule's pal more broadly this time, and the script gives him plenty of room for clowning (in one scene O'Connor has to masquerade as a WAC nurse while Francis hilariously heckles everybody). Very well done technically; you'll be amazed at how well the dialogue is fitted to Francis's facial movements. Both films have good supporting casts, especialy Ray Collins and John McIntire in the first film, Lynn Bari and Julia Adams in the second, and Chill Wills and ZaSu Pitts in both. A fun show from Universal.",971827200,19,989,4.7894736842105265

546009,4,6303072356,"This is a very light hearted movie that is meant only for kicks and giggles. It is clean and fun for adults and children alike. There are some slow parts that are more about twisting the plot than action, which is fine by me. It might bother some other people though. Overall a good movie!",1427328000,,289,4.2727272727272725

546015,3,6303072356,I ordered this DVD because I thought it was the sequel to the first one.  It ended up being the same one I already had.  A clearer or more detailed summary would be useful for this particular DVD.,1392249600,,196,4.131578947368421
546016,3,6303072356,"A talking mule was quite original back in 1950 when I first saw this film.  Looking back on it now, however, after nine years of televisions Mister Ed and the current plethora of talking cartoon animals, it seems a bit dated.  Even so, its still a fun film to watch, especially if you like Donald OConnor.  And, if you watch it closely youll likely see quite a few other familiar faces, many whom were relatively unknown at the time but went on to enjoy long and successful careers in films and on television.  In any event, I enjoyed this film once again, but it still puzzles me: Why didn't I ever wonder why Francis was always standing around, all by himself, in the Japanese infested jungle?  And where were all the other mules?",1388966400,,732,4.473684210526316
546017,4,6303072356,this is one of my favorite old films that I remember from childhood. I think Donald is at his best in this film,1371686400,,111,3.869565217391304
546018,3,6303072356,"the film is a cute one but doesn't hold up to the test of time. Donald O'Conner is charming but the story is so shallow that it gets boring quickly. I wish he danced or sag in it, it would have helped quite a bit.",1364169600,,213,3.7555555555555555

7836078,5,6303072356,"The true story of Francis (and David Stern) in Burma during WWII.  The movie is the whole truth till about the last 3 minutes when it was given a Hollywood ending so there could be sequels.  And you thought Hollywood ending came about only in the last 30 years.  As for the sequels, the producers did not think the original voice of Francis was important to carry over.  Francis' voice with delivery and wit carry this movie.  This DVD has a couple of excellent shorts about the creation of Universal Studios and MCA.",1512604800,,517,4.516129032258065

I remembered how much my dad liked it, so when I saw it on Amazon I had to buy one for my dad's 90th birthday and one for myself!  Watched it with the grandkids the other day and they were rolling in the floor!",1450915200,,347,4.134328358208955
