8290347,3,B001CXZ0JA,I'm a very good fan of Lea Salonga and I have all of her albums and DVD's but this one really dissapointed me. I mean the disc came in good conditions and in the proper case but when I played the DVD there were some parts where the video run in a different direction from the audio. I don't know if that is because of the original material was recorded like that or because the guy who edited the material and sent it to me did an awful job. The final product is  not very good.,1234396800,,478,3.9791666666666665
8290348,5,B001CXZ0JA,"I originally owned this on VCD, so I couldn't wait to see the better quality of DVD, plus there are a couple of songs on the VCD that have the audio & video annoyingly out of synch.  Unfortunately, the release on DVD didn't correct the out of snych problem, but it doesn't take away from the overall quality of Lea's amazing voice, nor the stunning visual clarity on DVD.  If you want to see what Lea's fantastic concerts with a mix of her studio albums, Broadway show tunes, and movie songs are like, this is the best example!  The other thing I love about this particular concert are the glimpses into Lea's roots...songs and artists that inspired her or are part of her success that show who Lea Salonga is.  Besides her musical talent, it's her family and personality that make Lea a loveable and deserved idol, and why I'm such a fan.  Like any of Lea's concerts, I could watch this over and over and feel like there is no better way to spend my time!",1233360000,,956,4.378531073446328
