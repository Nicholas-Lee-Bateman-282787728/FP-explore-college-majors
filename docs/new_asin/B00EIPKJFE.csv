8605807,5,B00EIPKJFE,Great movie for girls who love horses! My 8 year old daughter loves Saddle club and will watch these tapes over and over. Highly recommend for anyone with a horse crazy girl.,1454544000,,174,4.46875
8605808,2,B00EIPKJFE,"This is advertised as a ""movie"" but is just really a number of TV episodes played together.  If you own the series DO NOT buy this.  My daughter loves the series and has watched all the episodes and was very disappointed that this was literally just more of the same.",1454284800,,267,4.32
8605809,5,B00EIPKJFE,"A wonderful series. My daughter loves it. She has watched it multiple times. Stories about friendship, life lessons, challenges to overcome and of course horses.",1453507200,,161,5.48
8605810,5,B00EIPKJFE,"Good Movie, I honestly would rather just watch the Saddle Club Episodes Season 1 & Season 2, I didn't like Season 3 because they changed the characters. ANYWAY... you have to know/ have seen the saddle club episodes to understand the movie & know whats going on. It's a good should for horse lovers.",1424908800,,299,4.555555555555555
