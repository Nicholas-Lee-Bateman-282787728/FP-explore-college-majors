7800063,5,1598870637,I loved this collection.  The series are great.,1441929600,,47,4.875
7800064,5,1598870637,This show is an American treasure.  Garrison is the Mark Twain/Will Rogers of our time.  His humor is surpassed only by his talent as a performer and a host who can interact with anyone who comes on the show. The scope and variations of performing talent is vast and amazing. These are shows that can be enjoyed over and over . I have the feeling of being healed by his wonderful tales of the people and events of Lake Wobegon. Highly recommended by me to those who can focus and enjoy some of the best things in life.,1410134400,2,518,4.275510204081633
7800065,5,1598870637,"I bought this for the Everly Brothers appearance and was not the least bit disappointed. Garrison Keillor is a delightful entertainer himself. It comes with 3 CDs but I haven't watched the other 2 yet, so don't know for sure who his guests were those days.",1398988800,2,256,4.586956521739131
7800066,5,1598870637,i enjoyed this dvd of the show  and it is a nice complement to hearing it on the radio .  should make more of these shows in dvd,1395360000,,128,3.5357142857142856
7800067,3,1598870637,"The subtitle of the DVD is ""Great Moments from the Radio Show"", which was a little misleading for me.  It seems to be three shows - each DVD a show.  While they are good shows I wouldn't say that they where the best or the greatest (in this case ""great"").  They are just three random shows that represent the spectrum of the early Prairie Home Companion series.  Don't get me wrong, they are good and worth watching, I was just disappointed in the fact that they were not a collection of some of the better moments.",1339372800,10,515,4.333333333333333
7800068,5,1598870637,"we use to faithfully watch prarie home companion on tv, it's good to see it again. if you are a fan you will appreciate some wholesome entertainment again.",1273449600,3,155,4.571428571428571
7800069,5,1598870637,"If you enjoy this show on radio, it is a great collection to have.  Now you can see what it takes for this insanity.
Excellent presentation.",1185148800,8,140,4.384615384615385
