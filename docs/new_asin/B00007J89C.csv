7976856,5,B00007J89C,"Mr Drake(McGoohan's character) is the man! He's a low-key James Bond type without as much but kicking/women.
Although he's still as suave/debonair as Mr. Bond...without all the fuss! All in all, a good show!",1394928000,,207,5.117647058823529
7976857,5,B00007J89C,Very good quality videos from 60's TV.  Patrick McGoohan at his best.  You will also occasionally see other actors who went on to become stars.,1290297600,,143,4.68
7976858,4,B00007J89C,"The only reason this volume of the Secret Agent collection gets a four is the two color episodes, which are appallingly below par, like a really, really bad James Bond movie. But you can't go wrong with any of the black and white episodes!",1080777600,3,239,4.454545454545454
7976859,5,B00007J89C,"Yes, yes, we got all of the one-hour episodes. But where are the first season 39 episodes? All of the 30-minutes ones that constituted the first Danger Man season with our best example of british cool Patrick Mcgoohan. Now that we have the Prisoner episodes, and all of the one-hour episodes of Danger Man, we really need to copmplete our Pat McGoohan collection! I think these 39 30-minutes episodes would fit nicely on 5 DVDs... Are you reading this, A&E?",1061078400,9,457,4.725
7976860,5,B00007J89C,"I'll be brief.  It's rare that a TV series has some of its finest episodes toward the end of the run, but DANGER MAN is a rare show.  And as far as I am concerned, the debate as to whether Drake is Number Six is really no debate at all.  Of course he is.  The Number Six character is never named otherwise.  McGoohan had to deny it for legal reasons, but the continuity of character is there (snapping fingers when nervous, same inflection of speech, even an old friend of Drake's with the same name appears both in DANGER MAN and THE PRISONER).  Enjoy these Final episodes, then watch THE PRISONER.  Such a pair of series, and such a great actor to make them work, will never come around again.",1055894400,14,695,4.3
7976861,5,B00007J89C,"Navigating its way to Japan, the Danger Man series ends with a bang, and this time in color.  A definite classic for any 60's video collection.",1052611200,4,143,4.5
