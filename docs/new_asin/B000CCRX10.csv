8097604,1,B000CCRX10,"Unfortunately, the production of this DVD has background music that nearly drowns out the narrator.  The images are fine, but I found myself struggling to hear what is being said, and I have no hearing issues, nor am I that old.  I'd be interested if there are others who have this same experience.  I mean, the background music is LOUD, really LOUD.",1330819200,,350,4.612903225806452
8097605,5,B000CCRX10,"As an art history teacher I can vouch for this short movie. It is the perfect supplement to a lecture on high middle ages/Byzantium Style and Giotto's shaping and contributions to the transition into the Early Renaissance. The video goes into detail on his life from birth to death with focus and explanation of all his major commissions in Florence and Rome. It is not the typical history channel documentary with more fancy effects and images than information. This video gets to the point and is jammed packed with useful information, not only about Giotto, but also of the Franciscans. Some great shots and video of his work...you can really feel the pieces. Great Video.",1321228800,6,675,4.878260869565217
