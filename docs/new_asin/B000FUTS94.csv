8126867,5,B000FUTS94,"Scott Tennant is a founding member of the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet, a consummate award-winning performer and recording artist, and a much-sought-after expert in the study and performance of classical guitar. This book is a collection of exercises for early-level students, and valuable review for teachers and mature artists, infused with Mr. Tennant's down-to-earth understanding of his topic and ability to convey it personally.",1407369600,2,432,5.765625

8126869,4,B000FUTS94,"Ok, so watching this whole video can get rather boring, but then again, most instructional videos are. I feel the author could have played more songs and examples illustrating the techniques he talks about. Mr Tennant shares with you some ""crazy"" ideas of how nails should be shapped, I have only seen him with these nails or heard of anybody that shapes them like that, but his nails seem to work for him nicely. He also talks about this wrist/arm positon that although it makes all the sense in the world, it feels like the most akward thing and I just can't feel the advantages or comfort he promises. Let me tell you one thing though, with this video I finally tapped into the mistery of ""tremolo"" so I finally learned how to do it after much patience and exercise with this, so for that I am truly grateful. Don't forget to get the book which I think is far superior than the video, but the video is a nice complement to the book.",1225929600,12,935,4.379310344827586
