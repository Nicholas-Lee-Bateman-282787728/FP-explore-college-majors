8600144,3,B00E1OAENO,"Too aimed at wedding, posed people photography.  Little you cannot find on the web for free.  Does explain the details of the mechanics of the SL1 adequately, but far too quickly. The big issue for the novice/beginner is choosing among lenses, and given even the variety of Canon lenses, much more needs to be said. (Don't skimp on lens price is hardly helpful.)",1410652800,,362,4.73015873015873

8600146,5,B00E1OAENO,"I love this DVD. It is so informative and detailed.  After investing money in the camera, it is so worth your investment to buy this video and learn all about your new camera.  Plus it offers general photography lessons too.  You can't go wrong!  I was debating after spending so much money on the camera to purchase yet another item.  Great investment. I already learned enough about the camera in a few lessons than I would have ever known deciphering the manual.",1395187200,3,465,4.621951219512195

8600148,5,B00E1OAENO,"I loved this video. This was very well done. As I was watching it, my teenage daughter sat down with me and watched it as well. Now I can't keep her away from my camera because she now knows how to use it. There is a LOT of info and I will probably have to watch it more than once to really get it all but would definitely reccomend this",1375747200,7,337,3.8285714285714287
