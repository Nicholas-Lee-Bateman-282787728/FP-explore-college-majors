8711826,4,B00W1W3GJC,"""I am the Whistler, and I know many things, for I walk by night. I know many strange tales, many secrets hidden in the hearts of men and women who have stepped into the shadows. Yes... I know the nameless terrors of which they dare not speak.""

That sound familiar? If it does, then you, brother, are either very old or a classic radio buff. That quoted stuff above was the opening to The Whistler radio mystery show that broadcast from 1942 to 1955. Beginning in 1944, Columbia Pictures adapted The Whistler into a film noir series, to the sum of eight films, seven of which starred Richard Dix, each time playing a different character.

""Radio's Master of Mystery... now on the screen!"" cries the vintage movie poster. On cinema The Whistler follows the tradition he'd established on the radio. Voiced with sepulchre glee by an uncredited Otto Forrest, The Whistler is our omniscient host, a shadowy figure who serves occasionally as the narrative's grim Greek Chorus. From his all-knowing perspective he delights in mocking them crooks.

In San Francisco, a miserable businessman suffers pangs of guilt over his wife's death. He can't stand what he perceives are accusing looks bestowed on him by his friends. In a disreputable waterfront bar Earl C. Conrad (Dix), looking to end it, coughs up $10,000 to a middle man, a death broker. The only caveat is that whoever is contracted to kill him must do so by this coming Friday. But what happens when Conrad has a change of heart and tries desperately to call off the hit? J. Carrol Naish is memorable as the implacable unknown assassin who dismisses Conrad's frantic I-take-it-back. He would rather conduct his own psychological experiment in ""rough shadowing,"" a tracking method in which the shadow allows the mark to catch glimpses of him. The killer is curious to see if the mark will crack under pressure.

THE WHISTLER, directed by William Castle before he got all gimmicky, early on establishes a moodiness and, thanks to the Whistler's haunting presence, an eeriness and a sense of impending doom. Running at around 59 minutes, we follow Conrad as he makes one bad decision after the next, scrambling around trying to cancel his self-imposed kill contract. Except that Earl C. Conrad is no action hero or savvy gumshoe. He's just an ordinary joe, neck deep in odd straits, and Richard Dix convincingly portrays this. Gloria Stuart (whom you may remember as the old woman in TITANIC) has a supporting bit as Conrad's faithful assistant, Alice Walker. It doesn't look it as the plot unfolds, but she figures more prominently in the narrative than you'd think, or at least in the third act, a passage during which her boss finds himself at wit's end and about to get what he paid for. Will Earl C. Conrad bumble himself to the grave? Will the killer satisfy his curiousity regarding necrophobia? That ominous whistling figure knows... for he is the Whistler.",1457827200,,2914,4.8453815261044175
