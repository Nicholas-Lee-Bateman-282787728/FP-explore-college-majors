8189362,5,B000P6RARK,My daughter and I used the DVD to help my grandson in the pool.  We wanted him to love the water and have confidence when swimming.  The video was easy to follow.  My grandson was afraid to put his face in the water.  We watched the video together with him.  He was encouraged by watching the children in the video.  We followed Miss Bea's advice by counting 1-2-3 and pouring water on his face.  He came out of the water with a smile on his face.  He really enjoyed the games that Miss Bea recommended to learn skills.  He is now swimming like a fish!,1525996800,,552,4.180952380952381
8189363,5,B000P6RARK,Miss Bea made our grandson like the water after watching her video. At six years old he is really enjoying the water and getting to be a more accomplished swimmer.,1522195200,,163,4.466666666666667
8189364,5,B000P6RARK,"Here is a story of a recent great success thanks to methods we learned from Miss Bea!

Micaela (my granddaughter who just turned 4 years old) announced that she wanted to go to the neighbor's pool without the 'floaty' and 'have a lesson.' (This was after work last night.)

She stood at the steps and showed me how she can stand in the water now with her face barely above the water when she tips her head back. She played at the steps for a while, putting her face in and 'swimming'/splashing' toward the steps. She didn't want to let loose and 'swim' a few feet to me as we have tried many times. ""I'm a little scared,"" she verbalized.

 Theo (two years old), on the other hand, was swimming about with his pink 'floaty' on, his head held above the water by the foam under his chest and around the arms. (Bea said there is a better vest-device that allows freedom for the arms.)  He would jump in from the side and freely 'swim' after re-emerging from under the water, unruffled by the water in his eyes. I encouraged him to take his floaty off and 'swim' to me. He stood on the step and with wide eyes, abandoned himself to the water.  I gently 'pulled' his head toward me as he kicked and moved his arms pretty effectively.

This encouraged Micaela. After what seemed like a long time of her playing alone, she decided to come to me with her head down and under the water. 'Stand closer Ita.'  Very soon after short jumps to me, I moved back a few feet and she began swimming. What an incredible victory. Felipe and John were in the middle part of the pool engrossed in conversation and didn't even notice. We didn't make a fuss at all. I encouraged her as she did it over and over, now with my standing in the middle of the pool. She was beaming. I tried to encourage her to go to the other side, but no, not this time. But just as she overcame her fear this time, she will do more. I was very proud of her and she was so proud of herself. ""You are so strong and brave,"" I encouraged her. ""You're my fishies!""

Soon, Theo was pushing himself to do the same, though it was his confidence that has encouraged Micaela first. Be the end of the time in the pool, both were trying to swim to me at the same time. It was tricky getting Theo to wait his turn. ""Ma turn!!"" He'd announce. I tried to get him to say 'ready'! when he wanted to lunge toward me.  He did 'take turns' for the most part, waiting with great impatience and eagerness to plunge in from the steps and kick toward me (arms not as effective yet.)

Micaela began sitting on the step when I would turn Theo around so he could 'swim' to the steps into her waiting arms. She was so proud of him and gleeful. I still guided his head a bit to keep him moving, but he was doing quite well under his own power also.

Finally Felipe and John noticed and made a big fuss. Then after transitioning to new arms, I got a break and they swam to 'Tito' (Theo's name for us) and I took a short swim.

I give thanks for all that we have learned from Miss Bea when my own children were young and now when my grandchildren are starting to swim!!!

8189365,3,B000P6RARK,"The DVD has good content but does not have the capability to skip through the lessons. Therefore, you have to manually rewind or fast forward to the lessons you want to watch. The picture quality is not the greatest. The copy the I got unfortunately is blurry in the beginning.

On the possitive note, the instructions are easily understandable and followed. This is important especially when trying to teach a 3 months old how to get accustomed to the water.",1407801600,,459,4.7375
8189366,5,B000P6RARK,"I have used Miss Bea's techniques on both my kids, my daughter who is now 4 years old is a very strong swimmer and we first purchased her DVD right after she was born.  I am now using the same techniques on my 4 month old baby.

I didn't know that my 4 month old baby would hold his breath underwater!  I did what Miss Bea showed on the video and have been pouring water on his face from his first time in the bath.  I am amazed that my son can glide underwater and he loves it.  I will use many of the activities with my son as he grows so that he will always love the water and learn to swim as early as possible and be safe in the water, just as my daughter did. Thank you Miss Bea!",1400112000,,685,3.795774647887324
8189367,4,B000P6RARK,"My husband and I like this dvd a lot. We started practicing all the methods with our son and it they work out very well, but you must be very committed to teach on regular basis for these methods to work. Will use  it for our second son too.",1381708800,,241,3.9183673469387754
8189368,5,B000P6RARK,"Before my son was born I spent a lot of time researching and reading anything and everything on which I could get my hands. I used to be a life guard and a swimming instructor for all levels of swimming and I think this is a terrific video with well thought out, clear, and well demonstrated instructions for what to do and how to do it. Yes, it is only 27 minutes long or so, but you don't need it to be longer. It'll help any parent work with their child (ages 0 to about 6) in and around the water. With enough practice of the techniques that are shown, the child could learn to propel him/herself in the water [shouldn't expect a child under 3 to hold their head above water while swimming/doing a doggy paddle -it is too heavy in proportion to their body, and so infants and toddlers swim with their head down].
No other video currently in the market (July 2010) compares. A very good book to complement this video, especially if you have infants/toddlers, is How to Teach Your Baby to Swim: From Birth to Age Six. I also used the techniques in this book (most of which can be watched in Ms. Bea's video) since my baby was born and he never had a problem with water in his face or in his ears.
There's only one small aspect of this video that I don't like and it is the instructor saying that if you can teach your child/infant to float on their back, they could potentially save themselves if they fell in the water. It doesn't keep me from recommending the video but parents should know that right now there is only one program that can help an infant/toddler survive if they fell in the water with no-one around and that is ISR [Infant Swimming Resource  [...]]. No YMCA or Red Cross swim lessons could help an infant/toddler with that because there is a lot more to water survival for this age group than knowing how to swim or float. Enrolling my 13 month old in ISR was the best thing I could've done [but I didn't find out about ISR until he was almost a year]. My son is now 19 months and with ISR he learned to propel himself under water, roll onto his back and float when he needs to take a breath/rest, and roll back to swim under water until he reaches me, the shore, the stairs, or the wall. ISR starts with children as young as 6 months to 6 years. As any parent knows, supervision is not perfect and so I'm thankful he can do this even though I watch him like a hawk in and around the water (any parent would). It is a gentle program. Sure, he cried during his 10 minute lessons each time, but he also cries to be taken out of the car seat and when he has to get a shot. Now he's less than 2 years old and is a little fish in the water. He has so much fun and I can tell he's so proud of his skills. The ISR lessons were worth every penny. He still watches Ms. Bea's video himself just for fun at least once a week. He asks for it!",1278288000,11,2851,4.127697841726619
8189369,4,B000P6RARK,We really liked this DVD.  It has great lessons to help you teach your child how to swim.  My son watched this with us and he used the ideas and began swimming this summer.  I began using these techniques on our baby and she loves the water and does not mind the occasional dunk - with the DVDs described warning.,1251504000,4,313,4.183333333333334
