1776282,5,B00006IGVK,This show is just plain funny! With more pop culture references than Dennis Miller it will leave you in stitches and begging for more! I just can't recomend Undergrads enough... It Rocks!!,1037750400,2,188,4.90625

1776286,3,B00006IGVK,"I love undergrads. Its was a great show.  I few months ago I got it from ebay. I was excited to once again see this show, but as soon as I got to the second disc it wouldnt play.  I tried it on three different dvd players and one blu ray player, but it kept freezing up.  So I decided to buy one from amazon thinking that maybe from a different seller the dvd might work. Well I was wrong. Again I had problems with the second  disc freezing up. It strange since the disc doesn't have any scratches. I guess their must be a bad batch of dvds. I sent back the amazon set and got my money back. I wonder if anyone else has had the same problem? I will be ordering it again some time later in hopes that with time they get rid of the bad dvds.",1404950400,,740,3.880794701986755

1776291,5,B00006IGVK,I didn't know about the dvd release until now (Sept 2010). I missed out! I used to watch this show religiously on our Cartoon Network (no mtv here in Canada. I love the characters. I really wish we could have had a second season - it is so unfinished - just like Clone High and Veronica Mars - whenever I watch the last episode I die inside a little.,1316995200,,350,4.086956521739131

1776293,5,B00006IGVK,"I enjoyed watching this show when I was younger and still enjoy it again through a certain website. So I thought hey why not buy the DVD and support the show. Well I did and when I finally received it the outside looked perfect, but then I opened it to find the little piece of paper on the left side of the DVD Case to be wrinkled up. It looked as though someone had already open the DVD that I got and returned it and then I had bought it as new. Well from that piece of Paper that's what I had instantly assumed. Though to be sure of my claim I looked at the DVDs themselves. The first DVD was spotless with what lighting I had on it, but the second DVD had smudges and finger prints on about 25% of the DVD.

I'm still going to give this a 5 out of 5, but I was just wondering why when I bought something branded as NEW that I got it looking half used. I believe I got the short end this time around, but it happens to us all at some point. I just hope this doesn't happen to all the games that I ordered from Amazon >_<

Well hope you all have better luck than I did and get something that's in pristine condition. Have fun and Good Luck Everyone. Farewell ^-^",1292976000,,1165,3.953191489361702
1776294,5,B00006IGVK,"Alas, another 2D animated series that died young.

If you've been to college, especially if you've
lived on campus, you'll get a lot of laughs out of
this.

The only thing that I can say is that people might
get the wrong impression from the box cover. I
could explain it, but it would be a small spoiler.
I sure did, but when I kept looking for animated
series to get, this kept coming up as a suggestion.
So, I got it, and sad that I waited so long.",1292284800,,451,4.056179775280899
1776295,4,B00006IGVK,Great DVD!  Even better show!!  Just wish that Season 2 had actually been aired..,1238371200,,81,4.714285714285714
1776296,4,B00006IGVK,"The show is very good. It's enlightening that many say that all but ""X"" character(s) was(were) boring, since X is usually who they identify with best. The show had someone for most people to identify with, and it touched on a lot of the common issues that college students face. Stereotypical? Yes. But there's just enough newness to keep the often told stories of college fresh.

In my mind it's up there with Undeclared for the most ""true"" college show. True not meaning blindingly accurate, but true on a more fundamental level. A couple episodes did seem drawn out a bit, and making a few of the characters (especially Cal, possibly Rocko) a little less stereotypical would have made it easier to relate to them, and would have stopped some pigeonholing (Cal being a constant womanizing idiot and Rocko being a constant wannabe womanizing idiot) that occured later in the series. But it was still a very good show overall.

The DVD was ok. Not bursting with features but it's got a few. I'd recommend getting the DVD if the words ""College TV Show"" make you interested at all.",1216080000,2,1079,4.703703703703703
1776297,5,B00006IGVK,"Pete Williams is a genius! He's like a geeky verison of Mike Judge. He does all of the voices so well and the real life experiences are so true and entertaining. It's a same they didn't make it for a Sophomore Season. Nevertheless a great series! Highly Recommend

1776298,2,B00006IGVK,"I rented the first disc of this and watched six episodes.  This show has a few funny bits but the majority of the jokes fall flat, primarily because of characters that only fulfil stereotypes without bringing anything unique to them.

Gimpy is funny.  The other characters reuse jokes over and over again that were never funny in the first place, and are generally annoying.  Cal is unbelievably dumb, but that's pretty obvious from his dopy expression and hearing him display his stupidity with his every comment gets old quickly.  Also Cal's voice has to be the most annoying thing I've ever heard come out of my television.  The dumb frat character is also dumb, crude, and everything you'd expect from a dumb crude fratboy (except, oddly, that his fratbrothers detest him, which is one of the few surprising things in his storyline).  He has zero depth and no sympathetic qualities.  The only surprising thing about fratboy is that his high school friends tolerate his constant macho bs and stupidity and only get mildy annoyed.  As far as I remember, computer nerds and idiot jocks didn't really hang out together in high school.  They didn't normally have much in common to discuss.  It's surprising any of these characters are friends with each other besides the ""sort of"" main character, Nitz.  Nitz isn't funny either.  He's the stereotypical ""regular guy"" with no irregular characteristics besides that he's friends with such a diverse group of people.  He is pretty boring (perhaps a side-product of being completely ""regular""), and his obsession with an older girl who barely notices him would be boring to anyone who didn't go through a similar experience and ineptly flounder around in a similar way.  Heck, even to those of us who did, we know what's going to happen.  Hasn't this been done in enough 80's movies?

There're very few funny occurances and the dialogue isn't great.  The show is completely predictable (that won't spoil the humor for some people) and desperately attempts to appeal to viewers who had similar friends in high school or college.  Unfortunately, I was friends with no stereotypes in high school- only individuals with uniquely blended personalities.

The occasional Gimpy storyline is surreal and fairly entertaining.  If he had more screen time it would have helped.",1186272000,4,2310,5.010498687664042
1776299,5,B00006IGVK,"I got the complete first season of Undergrads for Christmas last year and have been watching it ever since. I started watching this show back when it was running on MTV in '01 and it's great to see the other things in college and show that it's not just all fun and partying most of the time it's dealing with stuff like finacial aid, long lines, and dealing with other awkward/stupid trations at times.",1134864000,6,403,4.45945945945946
1776300,4,B00006IGVK,"With Family Guy back on air, Fox should Seriously debate nabbing up this show and putting it back on air. Its a great show that the demographic of the Simpsonas and Family Guy would love, plus the guys still have 3 years of college to complete.",1119657600,4,244,4.326086956521739
1776301,5,B00006IGVK,"To borrow a line from Trio TV.  Undergrads was one of the funniest, most original series ever.  I was amazed to find out Pete Williams, the creator, was only about 19 when the show was first conceived.  It will certainly speak most to the Generation Y crowd, but I have to admit I was surprised at how similar the experiences shared by Nitz et al were to my own college years (1981-85--OK, no computers yet, and Star Wars was still in its infancy and not yet a full-blown cult).
 The extras are pretty nice, too, I enjoyed the character bios.  Pete is rather awkward on camera but he's fun to listen to as he talks about his creation.
Seeing that final optic, ""2080 hours to sophomore year,"" is a cruel joke, because, of course, sophomore year never came.  Damn you, MTV!!!
For  time I hoped that some enterprising cable network might pick up the show and revive it, but several years went by and no doubt Mr. Williams has moved onto other projects.",1106611200,,949,4.4508670520231215
1776302,5,B00006IGVK,"Ok, in all honesty, I can see how undergrads could be contsrewed as having a cult following. But it still HAS a following! I was STOKED to get this on DVD because NO-ONE will air it in Australia!
I haven't had the DVD at my house for longer than a week at a time in the last few months, from all my friends borrowing it! The series ROCKS, and to say otherwise is to admit you've never experienced life as a young adult going through university/college! Will ANY network pick up this gem for a second+ season???
If you haven't seen it, get this DVD and enjoy Gimpy, because deep down inside, we all like Star Wars just as much as him.",1088035200,6,633,4.19672131147541
1776303,5,B00006IGVK,"I like this show from the humerous and slapstick actions they do, and their story is very interesting and funny. As everybody knows, it revolves around 4 charecters, in which two are actually intersting, Rocko and Nitz, the rest like that male bimbo and the internet geek are just colourful charecters created to waste time, and rumor has it that the four charecters were created by Silent Bob charecter, Kevin Smith. I think this show is one of the more realistic tv shows to come out and the way they based it on a less popular charecter is what makes it illusive to watch. It may be aired on one show, but the DVD is out, so for those who haven't cable, buy this. One of the best cult comedies out there since Dilbert.",1086393600,3,721,4.388059701492537
1776304,4,B00006IGVK,"I made a half hearted attempt to record all of the episodes off of Teletoon (Canadian Cartoon Network) but never really completed the task.  And now I don't have to because I just bought the complete first season on DVD.  YAY!!
I LOVE this series even more so than my real life, probably because my real life pales in comparison in both entertainment value and humorous content, also, GIMPY IS MY HERO!!!
Now on to the quibbles:  One, the special features are sparse.  I was hoping for a wee bit more behind the scenes stuff like some interviews with cast and crew besides Pete (although Pete is most of the cast and his interview is quite entertaining).  I would have also loved to have actually HEARD a few of the audio commentaries (a second ENG 2.0 stereo track does appear on some episodes, but all I hear is a duplicate of audio track 1).
Complaint number two is a strange thing that I've noticed when I play the discs on my Toshiba DVD player.  At the end of every chapter (ie where there would normally be a commercial) the shows pause and the only way to bypass this is to press the FF button and then rewind to the beginning of the chapter.  On the positive side, this only occurs on my DVD player, and is not an issue on the system in the living room, or on my computer. So, although this is an annoyance, it will not result in my returning the set for a replacement.
But even with all of that, I still highly recommend this DVD set.  Show your support for Undergrads, GET MTV off there behinds and give us Season 2 or at least ONE MORE EPISODE to tie up all the loose ends!!!",1084060800,2,1587,4.2842809364548495
1776305,5,B00006IGVK,"My only complaint with this show is that there are only 13 episodes. Everytime I watch the last episode I thirst for a season 2.
I am in college right now and this show is great at depicting college life. Everything from their RA (The Dougler) to how nerds act in college is great. It might be exaggerated for humor but anyone who has been in college can relate to it.",1083456000,2,368,4.197183098591549
1776306,5,B00006IGVK,"Undergrads has got to be one of the best and most underrated animated shows to come on in a long time.  I love all the characters and it's scary how the four guys all resemble four of my friends VERY closely.  Being in college myself I can say it is slightly exaggerated, but not extremely so.  I don't dorm but I wouldn't doubt that there are some crazy RAs in our dorms at NJCU.  If you are a fan of Undergrads please support the show by purchasing this season in hopes that it will send a message that Undergrads needs to continue.  If it worked for Family Guy (which I hear goes back on the air December of this year) then there's hope yet.  Now all we need is Daria to be put on DVD.",1076025600,6,688,4.059259259259259
1776307,5,B00006IGVK,"Undergrads has got to be one of my all-time favourite shows. I taped all the shows, and now got the DVD. The similarities between my friends and the characters is scary, and kind of sad. All the characters are people you can relate to, and will enjoy seeing them being poked fun at. The show is able to deliver solid humour throughout the entire series. Every scene is packed with with both obvious and extremely subtle jokes. Every time you watch it, it's like there's something more to discover about it. The animation is great, and again, there's subtle joke thrown into every scene, even down to the posters on the walls.
All in all, an amazing DVD, I highly recomend it, guy.",1064188800,5,680,4.536585365853658
1776308,4,B00006IGVK,"This is another of those animated series that MTV put on in the wake of ""Bevis and Butthead,"" like ""Daria,"" but cast into the Outer Darkness when the characters failed to become Cultural Icons and grab the super giant ratings.  (I wish ""Daria"" episodes were on DVD, too.)
No matter.  ""Undergrads"" is the story of four high school buddies who've slipped the parental leash for the first time and are attending college.  There's Gimpy, the computer geek; Cal, the idiot ladies' man; Rocko, the drunken frat boy; and Nitz, the somewhat-innocent who's the moral center of it all.  There's also Kimmy, the one-year-older object of Nitz's fantasies; and Jessie, who's a friend to Nitz and may want to be more than that.  They spend their time learning about life, what they can get away with now that they're out of their parents' homes, and what they can't get away with.
Though it's not without flaws (for instance, though the characters occasionally study, they never seem to be in class or with teachers---what kind of colleges do they go to, really?), it's well worth the time to check out, especially now that it's on DVD.  There's frank and raunchy humor, a healthy amount of digitally-obscured nudity, and a lot of fun to be had.
It's no ""Daria,"" but if you liked that, check this out, too...",1063152000,4,1294,4.728888888888889
1776309,5,B00006IGVK,"Undergrads was one of those shows that slipped under the radar and became a pleasant surprise whenever I caught it on TV.
Basically the show is centered around four longtime friends Nitz, Cal, Rocko and Gimpy and their endeavors at college, or more specifically dorm life at college.  The four guys are so different from each other it seems a bit unrealistic, though creates much more interesting dynamics among the characters.  The animation and design is quite good for an MTV show and the stories were great.  The writers wisely decided to keep the stories out of the classrooms and focus on the more interesting aspects of college.  It always felt like we were watching someone's college experiences.
The characters were each individual with traits so real that everyone knows someone like each of the four main characters.  Nitz was so similar to me in appearance and personality that it was a bit disturbing (I later found out he was based off of the creator Pete Williams).  The main female characters are great too.  Kimmy was everyone's unattainable girl and Jesse was everyone's cool friend.
The first episode ""Party"" was always my favorite, having so many great gags (The Aliens reference, the bootleg DVD, Nitz's unnatural fall down the stairs- I always crack up when I see that one).
There aren't many downsides to the show, but they sometimes push that TV-14 rating.  The episode ""New Friends"" I found to be needlessly graphic, depicting characters getting blown up by grenades.  It's a bit unsettling to say the least.  The DVD doesn't have much of anything in the way of extras (I had hoped for some more informative commentary) but that's to be expected.
The fact that Undergrads was put out on DVD at all is good enough for me.  While it's a bit frustrating to know we won't see these characters continue into another season, the last episode ""Screw Week"" makes for a satisfying conclusion.",1060992000,8,1908,4.84
1776310,4,B00006IGVK,"I really like this cartoon. In my opinion, this cartoon is very  well made. The animation looks good, and the stories are well written.
I did not see this cartoon on MTV, because let's face it, MTV is not really known for giving shows other then the cheaply made (So-called) reality based Television shows, a chance at doing well. So I did not want to get hooked on something, that was destine to be canceled.
This DVD set can be found for under 20 dollars, so it is cheaper then most sets. You get 13 episodes, with some behind the scenes footage, commentary, character background info, ect. It is a pretty solid set. I have seen each episodes on TV and on DVD more times then I can count and I still have not gotten sick of watching them. (That's one of the staples of a good show, you never get sick of seeing it)
It's up to you, but 20 dollars for 300 minutes of cartoon, seems like a good deal to me.",1060905600,15,905,4.2011494252873565
1776311,4,B00006IGVK,"""Undergrads"" is one of the best television programs of the last ten years.  Of course it will inevitably draw comparisons to ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Critic"" because of its wide array of pop culture references, but the real reason ""Undergrads"" resonates is in the details.  Creator Pete Williams cleverly focuses on four characters who were best friends in high school and how this will affect their friendship once they enter college.  Each of the characters are very different, but Williams and the shows other writers do an excellent job of showing the dynamics that keep their friendships together.  The four characters are obviously types: Rocko is the lunkheaded frat-boy with the penchant for booze and porn; Gimpy is the shut-in computer nerd who always quotes ""Star Wars""; Cal is the vapid ladies' man ; and Nitz is the likable, shy, insecure and stubborn guy.  They are complemented by a stable of fantastic supporting characters: there is Jesse, the girl with the crush on Nitz; Kimmy, the girl Nitz has a crush on who is in every school club (a la Max in ""Rushmore""); Brody, the Hollywood dreamer/insider ; The Duggler, the RA who nobody likes ; Monk, Gimpy's faithful sidekick ; and Kruger, the foul-mouthed cynic.  Unlike ""The Simpsons,"" which is trapped in an eternal present, ""Undergrads"" actually advances in a linear fashion.  Details from the first episode ""Party"" show up in the penultimate episode ""Risk"" (in which they all play the board-game Risk), showing how all these details have been worked out by the creators, something that does not happen with this much skill in most animated comedy shows.  In ""Daria,"" for instance, characters and themes recur, but the sense of progressing time is always vague and slightly distorted.  Not only is the show tightly written, many of the characters' traits are firmly exploited for some great humor.  Gimpy's devotion to ""Star Wars"" necessitates an intense dislike of all things ""Star Trek"" related (notice how in the first episode Gimpy has a Captain Kirk blow-up punching doll?).  The also exploits the flashback, dream and desire devices to new ridiculous heights and depths, as well as the newspaper headline device to humorously sum-up less vital plot points (""RA Crumples Up Newspaper in Disgust,"" etc.).  People who have been to college, and especially those who lived in dorms will probably like this show more than others because it obviously exaggerates some aspects of college life.  But that is part of the show's charm.  The reason for the four-star review is that some of the earlier episodes are hampered by weak jokes and bad timing.  But as the first season progresses, the humor picks up with lightning speed and intelligence.  Highly recommended, and here's hoping for a second season ... just watch the final episode to see what I mean!",1060300800,5,2821,4.995726495726496
1776312,5,B00006IGVK,"Don't listen to the guy who was putting the show down, his claims were baseless and untrue - he's obviously seen very little of the show.
If you're into show like The Family Guy, The Simpson, The Critic, and Futurama, then you will no doubt love this show. Each of the four characters is a well developed exageration of each of the four personality classes that an undergraduate student may find him or herself in. The brilliance behind this idea is that it demonstrates the pros and cons of the campus life through the interaction of different class characters. The main character Nitz goes through many of the same experiences as real life undergraduates do and through all the humour, subtle messages are conveyed about how to deal with those experiences. This may restrict the humour to only those who know of such campus experiences, but generally the humour applies to everyone.
For any teenager or young adult, this show is a must see. Interlaced with current music hits and events, the show has an edge to it that has never been done in cartoons. But for an MTV production, that's not too surprising. I just hope there will be more of it in the future.",1060214400,2,1160,4.635922330097087

1776314,5,B00006IGVK,"don't listen to the one jerk below who claims this show isn't good.
This show is a damn fine piece of work.  Everything about it just makes you remember your days in college, or agree with things because you are currently in college.
The characters' friendship mirrors that of the friendships we have.  not always perfect, sometimes good, sometimes bad.
And when you see gimpy walking out of his dorm, for the last time (since there currently isn't a second season) while ""Overboard"" by the Rosenbergs is played in the background, it's almost enough to make you cry.
or at least remember that ending for the rest of your life.",1060041600,6,626,4.681818181818182
1776315,4,B00006IGVK,"Yes, I am an Undergrads fan.  A full-fledged fan.  I even walk around talking like Cal occasionally.  I know it's sad, but this show is truly, unashamedly funny and at a few key moments, absolutely hysterical (see the episode ""Risk"" if you don't believe me).
What makes this show work is its unflinching satire.  Every kind of school stereotype is nitpicked here, and while that particular device may have been used before many times over, it still feels as fresh as ever here with every scathing blow.  The chemistry between the characters also works well enough to the point where you actually care about them.
But it's not the fact that the show is absolutely uproarious that sold me 100%.  The final nail in the coffin, so to speak, was the fact that the show has heart.  There are touching moments where friendship is displayed that gets you deep down inside.  While some are played for laughs, there are others that are sincerely emotional.  Maybe I'm just a big softy, but I enjoyed that part of the show the most.
Being a senior in high school about to go to college, this show gave me a slight (albeit exagerated) idea of what college may or may not be like.  Thus, I am able to relate to the characters' experiences.  Sort of.  I can also relate to the social akwardness of the main character Nitz and him always trying to get the girl that is seemingly unreachable (oh, how many times that has happened to me...).  His three best friends are good supporting characters that make Nitz' presence seem worthwile.
If you're in the mood for a light-hearted cartoon with a great sense of humor, well-timed one-liners, social satire, and a good nature and you can suspend your disbelief for a few hours, then by all means, you won't be able to do much better than Undergrads.",1059955200,8,1779,4.591772151898734
1776316,2,B00006IGVK,"Don't be fooled by the other reviewers this show is not that great. The main character Nitz is someone that really irritates me, he has no personality and isn't funny, coincediantelly none of his friends are very funny either. I saw the premire of this show when it was on MTV, but stopped watching after the 2nd episode, recently Ive seen about 5 other episodes on Comedycentral and ahve concluded that unless the 5 or so episodes that are on the dvd are totally unlike the rest  of the series this is definetely a waste of money, and buying the South Park or Family Guy dvd's would be a much much wiser descision. Just to get a sense of how this show isn't good the creator got it on the air because he won a contest, I'm serious, worst of all the shows theme song is buy Good Charlotte and the creatoor makes a bunch of references to them with the characters which he voice, I guess the person who made this is exactly the kind of person who I don't like and who are roining the entertainment industry. Again get the Family GUy or South Park DVD's instead, if you are corious about the show try renting at a place that carries DVDs of tv series, but I don't reccimend you do.",1059436800,,1178,4.2825112107623315
1776317,5,B00006IGVK,"""Undergrads"" was one of the shows to come out during the glut of animation at the turn of the century and as quickly as it started it was over. It was a real shame, because had it not been lost in the shuffle it could have been remembered as one of the best cartoons ever.
It's hard to put what made ""Undergrads"" so special into words. The animation is adequate but nothing special. The quirky brand of observational comedy produces some truly funny moments, but the humor itself does not make the show. Instead, the decisive factor is its plethora of wonderful characters. College is filled with a diverse mixture of people, and by distilling them down into their archetypes creator Pete Williams has created a cast that represents nearly all of them. Anyone who ever went to college probably knew the pathetic porn loving jock, the nerd obsessed with fantasy worlds, ""The Girl"" who is a member of every club, charity, and activist group around, the self-described ""Sarcastic cool girl who hangs out with dorks"", and so on. The problems they face and the lessons they learn are the problems and lessons of every undergrad. It's because the characters and situations are so familiar that after only a couple episodes you will feel like your good friends and care about their zany adventures, because most likely some of them actually are actually your friends, and they are issues you yourself had to deal with.
The attitude is perfectly captured in the excellent theme song by Good Charlotte: ""... The best years of our lives aren't as easy as they seem. To get the girl, to make the grade, it's all a show, it's all a game. And I would lose it if I played, but anyway... ""
Of course, since it was cancelled it has been difficult to find convenient times to watch the reruns. At the time of this writing, it is only viewable in America weekly on Comedy Central at 1:30AM Sunday nights, hardly convenient for nearly anyone who has a job, and even many students. I'm ecstatic that this series is coming to DVD so that I'll be able to watch the episodes at my convenience again and again. I recommend this to anyone who ever has been, is going to, or ever will go to college. You won't be disappointed.",1058400000,4,2200,4.572151898734178

1776319,1,B00006IGVK,"Fans of Animation Beware! Undergrads suffers from poor production values. The biggest gripe being that the characters in the show are constantly being presented to you in a 3/4 angle wich never varies. No profiles, No Frontal, not even a 2/4. Just 3/4, 3/4, 3/4. I refuse to belive that the Animators/storyboarders/character desingers made this glaring ommision to be ""Stylistic"". To me it just seems as if they were being lazy.
Even the Power Puff Girls varie in angles.
Recommended only if you like their sence of Humor and are not irratated by the constant 3/4 angles.",1055980800,10,571,4.896907216494846
1776320,5,B00006IGVK,"This show provides an outrageously funny, though sometimes incredibly accurate portrayal of adapting to college life. Though MTV buried the show on its first run, reruns on Comedy Central/Teletoon has created an at least cult following among the 18-25 set.
The first season builds the characters well and remains fresh until the end. At the end of this DVD, you'll be aching to find out what happens in sophomore year. The problem is that the show needs financial backing in order to produce more episodes.
By buying the DVD of the first season, you would contribute to the production of a second season. If sales figures are impressive enough, chances are that a cable network may pick up the tab for a new season.
So, for those who love the show in the U.S. and Canada, buy the DVD ... Let's get another season going!
For anyone else who remembers what college life was/is like, you'll be amused and amazed at how this show rings true...",1055721600,13,939,4.662650602409639

So many familiar cords are hit here as we view the life of the Clique as they transition to life in college separated for the first time by different schools.  Great characters, great soundtrack, and so many background jokes that even after my tenth rewatch of this story I'm catching new stuff.  Watch it, love it, and lament the lack of a continuation of this fantastic series.",1456963200,,486,4.5
