2925288,3,B000UUX2PA,"This tape is for the absolute beginner. It is slow and painstakingly repetitive, and not terribly challenging. The best part about it are the supplemental exercises from Pilates Complete Sculpt and Tone, a DVD I am planning to purchase soon.",1203724800,2,241,5.05
2925289,1,B000UUX2PA,i bought this in the hopes it would be more advanced. the woman is the most annoying instructor ever. don't waste your money if you have done core training before,1203638400,5,162,4.433333333333334
2925290,4,B000UUX2PA,So I guess I'm the only one to comment on this but I found the instructor a bit annoying. It's actually something I'm having a hard time dealing with - but it's a good workout so I'll just deal with it. It's beginning level is really basic but good for those just starting out or getting back to the gym after a long time.,1202342400,6,322,4.046875
2925291,5,B000UUX2PA,I am in decent shape and I work out at the gym. I had a session with a personal trainer and he told me I should work out with a ball and recommended this DVD. It has been amazing! It works my body in ways that my normal routine just doesn't touch. It has really toned my mid-section nicely. I never get bored because there are so many routines. Highly recommended!,1201392000,14,364,4.140845070422535
2925292,4,B000UUX2PA,"Has wonderful workouts, would recommend this to others.  Great for beginners still trying to learn how to balance on the ball.",1201392000,20,126,5.0
2925293,5,B000UUX2PA,"I had not done much with a ball before, just a couple of gym classes. This DVD was amazing! One level had a ton of great beginner routines and another level had more challenging workouts that really blast your core into shape. I can't believe how much stronger my abs have become! I have been using this for 6 weeks. The results have been amazing and it really keeps me motivated. This DVD is so much better than the DVD that came in the box with the ball I bought in the store that only had one workout on it. If you have any interest in working with a ball like this, this DVD is a must have buy.",1200528000,32,598,4.033613445378151
2925294,5,B000UUX2PA,"I purchased a ball to do the exercises my trainer has me do, but I wanted to do them at home. This DVD looked interesting and I thought it might have some interesting things. This DVD is really amazing because it has soooo many routines. There is a ton more on this than I have learned with my personal trainer. The beginner level is great, but it also has some more challenging routines that really add spice to my workouts. Great purchase and well worth the price.",1196121600,42,466,4.367816091954023
2925295,5,B000UUX2PA,I have used this DVD for three years now.  The thing I really appreciate is the movements done after each exercise to make it easy on the back.,1384128000,,143,4.107142857142857
2925296,1,B000UUX2PA,"As a novice physio ball user, I was hoping that by purchasing this video I would become a little more adept at using my ball.  I was expecting a challenging, yet instructive dvd where I can both learn the basics of using the ball, and at the same time, challenge myself.  The workouts (if you can call it that) were very slow moving, boring, and not in the least challenging.  There is a segment in the dvd where you can select a more ""advanced"" workout.  Eager to get a real workout, I was greatly disappointed because the so-called ""advanced"" portion of the dvd was a few sample snippets of another workout DVD.  Very disappointed with this purchase. This workout is a joke! Buyer Beware:  If you are looking for a challenging, non-geriatric core ball workout DVD, you may want to skip this one.",1347580800,4,797,4.538461538461538
2925297,1,B000UUX2PA,"Unless you like being talked to like you are a preschooler or have the IQ of a grapefruit, then stay away from this video. I don't know why there was so much good feed back on this because I felt like this was an utter and complete waste of money and time. The budget for the video production looked like it was under $10.
If you are looking for a good work out led by good instructors, look elsewhere.",1331251200,2,402,4.10126582278481
2925298,5,B000UUX2PA,"After 35 years of pain, I have finally been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.  The beginner section of this video is a challange but most are doable. I found the instructor to be helpful yet slow enough for a true beginer to learn.  Instructor encourages you to try, but to know your limits. Most of the excercises are the same as the ones I was doing during my Physical Therapy. Thank the makers of this video for a true work out for beginers who are in pain.",1326585600,,455,4.341176470588235
2925299,1,B000UUX2PA,"There MUST be better core ball videos out there! Karen Garcia (the main actor) starts off by stating that as we age, our sight and hearing diminish.  She then proceeds to speak almost in slow motion. I kept thinking she would start speaking normally, and was horrified to find out that that was the way the entire ""beginner"" section was presented! And this is TRULY for a first time, never- exercised-before beginner. The DVD changes actors for the challenging section, but that girl is really just interested in her hair. It's annoying because each segment (arms, legs, abs...) is just a few minutes long and doesn't run continuously, so you need to stop and click the remote to get to the next segment. I hate this DVD.",1278374400,17,721,4.677165354330708
2925300,1,B000UUX2PA,This dvd is for someone who hasn't exercised. This is not challenging. Don't waste your money or time on it. There are better ones.,1269129600,2,131,4.5
2925301,1,B000UUX2PA,"Please do not waste your money on this. It is terrible, slow, and boring. I am extremely disappointed.",1260144000,2,102,4.722222222222222
2925302,1,B000UUX2PA,"I would recommend it for the elderly or people undergoing physical therapy only and this is why it earns its one star.
I consider myself at a beginner level at this stage of my fitness and this DVD was way too easy for me.  It has a ridiculously long warm up (17 min!) followed by a ""balance"" section that was the same exercises as the warm-up but done with your eyes closed.  The remaining sections were not much of an improvement with very easy routines and the main instructor always seeming awkward.  Also the nice cover art is misleading as this video has the ugliest set I've ever seen in a workout DVD.  There's a small picture of it on the back of the case if you want to see what you're really in for.",1247788800,2,710,4.237037037037037
2925303,3,B000UUX2PA,"I'm a beginner and am fairly out of shape, so I thought this would be a good start for me.  Unfortunately, it moves WAY too slow and is quite boring, even for a beginner.  I find myself fast forwarding through the first several minutes of each section as the lady explains (talking VERY slowly) how to position yourself on the ball and find your balance.

The DVD does contain excerpts from a pilates workout, which are meant for more ""advanced"" users, but those routines really aren't that hard and are much more enjoyable.  I wish I'd gotten a DVD full of those routines instead of this one.",1247270400,2,593,4.514018691588785
2925304,1,B000UUX2PA,"This video was a big mistake, both for my purchase and those who published it.  It is full of mistakes, the woman instructor messes up several time on screen, both with dialoge and the actual exercises, she starts sentences and then as if someone off screen was queing her that she was messing up she does the ""uh, oh,"" and then just stops mid-sencence.  The exercises are poorly exicuted, and they actually forget to do both sides on several.

WHAT A FLOP!!",1243987200,3,458,4.560975609756097
2925305,5,B000UUX2PA,"Good for beginners to learn the ball and this did the trick for me.  Clear instruction for a beginner with a good assortment of things to work on.

I like it.",1238025600,,158,4.064516129032258
2925306,5,B000UUX2PA,"I was looking for a good DVD to start me off on the Core Ball and this worked fine.  Having not done core ball before I found the instruction well done and easy to follow, with a good introduction to the core ball and general exercises, with a selection of various routines to work with afterwards.

Found the workouts very good for me as a beginner to core ball.",1236038400,3,363,4.246376811594203
2925307,5,B000UUX2PA,"I like this workout and I pick it on the days that I'm not in the mood to sweat. I like how it really stretches you out. I feel loose and relaxed afterward. I have noticed that my core is strengthen up a bit from doing this for a couple months. It is not my only work-out.
It is a pleasant video. I think the more segments you add, the more you'll get out of it.
My mother uses this one too, she cannot take the stress of a high-impact workout. It is easy on the the joins and limbs. You do need to learn to balance, so don't rush yourslef.
If you're a cardio nut - this is not for you.
I will definately keep this one and keep using it. Worth the money and the time.",1235520000,10,667,3.8405797101449277
2925308,1,B000UUX2PA,"I am not very experienced with exercises using a Core Ball. My physical therapist gave me some exercises, and I hoped to learn more.

This DVD is too basic even for me, and I don't think it targets the Core muscle groups. It is very disappointing.",1233878400,5,247,4.369565217391305
2925309,1,B000UUX2PA,"This DVD is basicly the same DVD as Pilates Tone & Sculpt. It has a different cover and intro but most of the same exercises. If You own Pilates Sculpt and tone then you , like myself will be wasteing your $!!! Very dissapointed.",1232582400,5,229,4.2272727272727275
2925310,5,B000UUX2PA,"I have been using another DVD by Karen for awhile that I have been enjoying and wanted to learn Core Ball which I have not done before.

This DVD has been very helpful in meeting this goal.  Karen starts off with a detailed lesson about the Core Ball, how to use it and the moves, and I go back and watch this lesson from time to time.

There are then a series of routines of various exercises of time and areas to work on.  Some were a bit more challenging than others, but everything I was able to pick up on things as I went along.

The last section is more challenging routines with a different instructor who I also like, but the routines are still a bit past where I am now but should be fun to work with from what I have seen so far.",1229040000,2,740,4.006802721088436
2925311,5,B000UUX2PA,"I am new to Core Ball workouts that I am using to supplement my other exercises and this DVD fit the bill.

The instruction is very clear and broken down so it is easy to follow. There is a lesson that you can vieew which runs about 15 minutes to get you started, then 1/2 dozen routines of various lengths to target Abs, Arms work on balance and other things.  There is also a more challenging section that I have not yet done, since so far the beginning items are keeping me busy.

Definately a good choice if you are a beginner to core ball.",1227484800,2,544,4.161904761904762
2925312,5,B000UUX2PA,use it all the time,1213056000,,19,3.0
2925313,2,B000UUX2PA,This work out is for anyone who has never seen a balance ball.  There is a painstakingly long slow discussion at the begining discussing the basics of balance ball work out.  There might be 20 minutes of advanced exercises at the end of the DVD but the rest was a total waste of time.,1212969600,2,284,4.2407407407407405
2925314,1,B000UUX2PA,"I bought this because of all the great reviews. Now that i see there are more reviews, i'd like to agree with the negitive ones. This DVD was so awful that I could not do the workouts. The first set of workouts has an instructor that spends more time talking about proper form and less time doing the actual moves. The second set of workouts for advanced moves, is okay, but I did not feel sore the next day like I would if I had done a great ball workout. Also, the second instructor, was even more annoying than the first one, because she is very cheerleader-ish and too upbeat/blonde/barbie-esque. In short, what a WASTE of money!",1204156800,9,633,4.418803418803419
8214933,4,B000UUX2PA,GOOD WORKOUT,1479168000,,12,5.5
8214934,5,B000UUX2PA,Awesome.  I love the lessons  that's  included in this dvd. I had trouble staying on the ball. However with the lessons I am now much much better.,1441584000,,146,4.333333333333333
8214935,1,B000UUX2PA,"The title is perfect, this is definitely a entry-level  DVD moves very slowly,  may be for someone  new to excerise",1441152000,,115,4.65

8214940,2,B000UUX2PA,She is very slow when she speaks and I feel she could be a bit more upbeat.  Also the video didn't work in our player at first but we had to try another video player for it to work,1409443200,,180,3.6153846153846154
8214941,5,B000UUX2PA,great workout!,1405468800,,14,6.5
8214942,5,B000UUX2PA,Many of the DVD demonstrate but don't explain and teach. This one does. You won't be sorry you bought it.,1399852800,,105,4.3
