2995844,5,B000X1CRY8,"This film was recommended to me so I bought it. At the time I did not have a Reg. 2 player so I was extremely disappointed that I couldn't see it. When I was able to see it, I realized why my friends had recommended it. First, it is another Tom Hardy gem, though one of the British Foxes plays the lead and is very, very good.
The plot of the movie is suspenseful. You will never suspect what occurs at the end. The unrequited love angle seems almost an afterthought, tho the movie is based on a real story. It tells of the French Foreign Legion (into which no French men are allowed!) during the Algerian struggle for independence. Simon (the ""Deserter"") sees both sides of the struggle and wonders why, in a land so large, Arabs and Europeans cannot live together. Like they had done for generations. Poor Simon, he is so naive one thinks he will not make it out of boot camp. But he is befriended by DuPont (Hardy) and learns through him how to be a soldier and survivor. This is a terrifc movie, another indie, and I would get a copy of it before it goes out of print in both continents. It's worth it.",1265500800,19,1106,4.246445497630332

  it never amazes us that people go through stuff in the military.  it is just awful, but, it takes certain people to do it.  does it make better soldiers?  that remains to be seen.  sometimes one wonders if the awful training causes more damage than expected.  this movie shows that torture and it makes a dreadful result.  war movies show people in the most stressing moments, but you wonder if the results are worth it.  tom hardy has improved in the most recent movies that he has been in, but this one starts his persona in the other movies.  brooding is a good word to describe the character.  was the movie good?  it was ok. yrmv",1454198400,,643,4.401709401709402

They market it with Tom Hardy, but he's not the focus of the story which is very poorly written and portrayed by a bunch of second tier actors. One of the worst scenes is when after a bombing in a small Algerian town, the female lead gives shelter to the main lead actor playing a French Legionnaire who just happens to be in the vicinity, then drives him to a location of historical ruins in a  shiny red Fiat convertible to chat about their lives! Really? A shiny red Fiat convertible in rebellion torn Algeria in the 1960's? I guess the director must think the audience is both dumb and blind!",1454198400,,646,4.295081967213115

Englishman Simon Murray joins the French Foreign Legion after being turned down by the British Army during the Algerian struggle for independence.  Like many Simon is running away from his past.

Murray's story reports on his five years in the Legion in French dominated Algeria.  What sets this story apart is Murray's desire to learn about his host nation and their traditions.

Having have spent a good many years in the military, the representation of the camaraderie is spot on.  A soldier is only as good as his weapon and the man/woman at his or her side.  Enjoy this movie knowing the vast majority of it if NOT Hollywood.",1442620800,2,715,4.717741935483871

Some reviewers seem to have picked up on the line in the film that French nationals were not allowed to join the Legion. While the Legion was created primarily to allow foreigners to serve France, the soldiers were (and still are) always commanded by French Officers.  French nationals were allowed to join and even now constitute about 24% of the serving soldiers.

Apart from that long held (but incorrect) rumor, the basis of the story appears to be accurate.  Unfortunately, the way the movie was put together made it difficult to follow.  Scenes seemed to jump ahead to the next with no carry over so it was difficult to understand.

But he does make a stand and the film honors his actions with a decent portrayal of that one token moment. There are some sweetheart moments, girls doing some dancing, a great drum circle scene, and some mysteries I will not reveal. I do recommend this film, not the usual stab 'em and slab 'em military grind. Four stars because it was fighting in Algeria where my definitely American father received his Purple Heart for combat injury, during WW2.  How this all ties into history, can be confusing to some, but recall the post-WW2 era of ""Peace and Prosperity"", 1960.....hippies at home and war, always war, somewhere in the world.

2996348,4,B000X1CRY8,"The story of French Algeria is well known to me so, if I may, I'll give you an idea of whats happening, to ease any confusion.
 Imagine when the Spanish discovered the ""New World"" and some Spaniards moved to, lets say, Cuba. Now it's 150 years later and you are the 3X removed great grand child of those first immigrants. All you have know is Cuba, as a matter of fact, you see yourself as a Cuban first and a Spaniard second. So now, for reasons you find stupid and unacceptable, the king of Spain tells you, ""you are no longer part of the Spanish empire, that you will be subservient to the Indians, that or you must leave Cuba and move to Spain"". I didn't say ""return to Spain"" because you, nor your parents or their parents, have ever set foot in Spain.
That's the best analogy I can invent for you. It's about you, rightly or wrongly, not wanting to become an Indian.
The film, while not particularly well made, is a pretty accurate, one mans story/history, of de Gaulles giving Algeria back to the Algerians, what it takes to become a Legionnaire and (LOL) the confusion of being caught in the middle of the storm ;-}

2996364,5,B000X1CRY8,"It's a journey of personal discovery undertaken by a young Englishman Simon Murray
(Fox) who joins the French Foreign Legion during the Algerian struggle for independence,
after his girlfriend Jennifer (Maberly) rejects him. When Simon is rebuffed in love, he
decides to pursue another romantic ambition - fighting for something he believes in. In
the deserts of North Africa he soon meets a man who appears to be his very opposite, the
cynical and world-weary Dupont (Hardy), who fights only for himself. As Simon encounters
the ugly realities of war first hand, will he be able to hang onto his ideals or will he follow
the lead of his new comrade, Dupont? Unlikely friends in a melting pot of confusion, war
torn men question honour, hope, morality...because you can desert everything...except
yourself. The film is based on the true story of Simon Murray's book - Legionnaire: The Real
Life Story of an Englishman in the French Foreign Legion (July 2001).

The book is an essay of the brutality within the Legion, which the film has great difficulty in bringing to the screen.  The first half of Full Metal Jacket is far more effective and convincing in that respect.  I have read Legionaire three times, and was hoping the movie would convey the spirit and events contained therin.  It did not.  This movie has about as much historical accuracy as Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"". Very little.

2996366,4,B000X1CRY8,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

Simon Murray (Paul Fox) girlfriend has broken up with him. He wants to get far away from her and the pain, so he chooses to join the French Foreign Legion.
His timing couldn't be worse --the Algerian War of Independence (1954-62) was one of the most highly traumatic conflicts for the Foreign Legion.
One of the most unique aspects of the FFL is they are the only unit of the French Army open to people of any nationality.
While going through some very intense training, Simon becomes friends with  fellow Legionnaires Valdes (Aitor Merino), Dupont (Tom Hardy), and Rodriguez (Javier Alcina).
The young men, at first, can't wait to complete their training and go into battle. But as they enter deadly fire fights, ambushes and begin to see the realities of war and politics, they start to wonder, especially Simon.
Dupont tries to show Simon it's important to be a soldier, but more important to survive. But Simon has fallen in love again, this time with Nicole (Felicite de Jeu).  At first, the would be lovers, stand on the same side of the Algerian/French conflict. The more war he sees the more he questions his position and who really is his friend, and his foe.
Back in real life, Tom Hardy's engagement to actress Charlotte Riley could prove a long one. They have been on again, off again. ""You'd have to ask Charlotte when we're getting married,"" Hardy said. ""She's a difficult woman to pin down, as she's always so busy with work.""
They have become patrons of Bowel Cancer UK.",1345593600,,1543,4.707407407407407
2996367,3,B000X1CRY8,"This is a 2002 film that has been re released to shamelessly cash in on the increasingly deserved success of screen hunk, Tom Hardy (`Warrior' etc). It places his name up front but he is not the star. This is the film of the auto biopgraphy by Simon Murray - `Legionnaire'. Murray is played by Paul Fox, who must be related to a side board his acting is so wooden. His previous acting highs have come in the TV soap `Coronation Street' and the voice of Corff the bartender in video game `Dragon Age II'!

Well the plot goes that he gets rebuffed by a lady and in stiff upper lipped fashion he runs off to join the romance of The French Foreign Legion as his hero is Errol Flynn. His timing is pretty off as this coincides with the Algerian awakening for independence and as France has just been kicked out of Vietnam there are not that many places for him to be sent - so Algeria it is.

First he has to suffer boot camp and it is really not a very nice place at all and is actually done rather well. There he meets Mr Hardy playing Dupont a Frenchman. The film follows the ever increasing fractionalisation of the authorities in Algeria as Mr Murray becomes a sort of tourist historian. He goes for walks in the souks and visits mosques to learn about the Islamic culture and it is all a bit cringe worthy, I actually thought this is all a bit history for dummies at one point.

There is some action with explosives and shoot outs and an almost love interest with a certain Nicole - who phoned in her performance. It was all a bit too trite for my liking, if you know zilch about that period of history then this may have more merit as it is there is nothing new to learn here except maybe that  if you get jilted then instead of running off to join the French Foreign Legion  you may want to consider on line dating as an alternative.

Fans of Tom Hardy will not be that impressed with his on screen time either and there are much better films out there; `Battle for Algiers' being a classic and the less well known `Intimate Enemies' is well worth checking out. In English and some French this is a good book that has made an average film, but if you are still interested then I would advise going pour la rental.",1338768000,49,2216,4.251781472684086
2996368,3,B000X1CRY8,"The year is 1960. Simon Murray (Paul Fox) joins the French Foreign Legion because of his romantic notions. It is an iron clad contract for 5 years during which he is sent to Algeria where the Arabs are fighting for Independence. Like ""Full Metal Jacket"" the film takes you through the rigors of training with cruel and sadistic trainers. The diverse group of trainees bond together. Simon supplies us with some boring first person narration to the background of some melancholy French tune.

Simon makes it through training, and life gets better...almost. He gets a ""Dear John"" letter and wants to leave. In town he discovers the locals hate the French and want their independence. His romantic notions have placed him on the wrong side, one that he is committed to be a part. His ideas of life become confused and tested in the reality of life and conflict. There are French and Algerians who are on both sides of the independence movement, primarily for economic reasons.

In many ways this movie mimics the US involvement in Vietnam, and just about any war against colonization. There is a major exception to this film in that...well I will let that one go as that becomes the twist in the tale. And even though it may be history, it was history I was unaware.

The acting was acceptable. The film jumps from scene to scene. You don't know how one scene ends before you are in a scene you wonder how it began. Perhaps this was deliberately done by the director so the audience can feel the confusion of the main character, or maybe it was just poor writing and editing. This is one of those areas where one person sees genius and another sees idiot.

The action is light. The drama involves mostly men. There is next to no humor. Excessive first person narration with a mediocre sound track. A story that is theme heavy.

No-f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Most of the actual killing is off camera.",1329004800,14,1894,4.625

I might watch it again but only because I am in love with Tom Hardy. His character is the best one. You already know that my opinion is biased. The lead character just didn't do anything for me at all. I really can't see that character in the Legion. I really have to blame the actor, the casting person, and the script for this.

The story could have been good, but I wound up getting people confused. I kept asking my friend who watched it with me, ""Is that the one girl or the other girl?"" Some things took too long to develop, and some story elements didn't develop at all.",1318723200,3,690,4.103703703703704

When I was able to see it, I realized why my friends had recommended it. First, it is another Tom Hardy gem, though one of the British Foxes plays the lead and is very, very good.
The plot of the movie is suspenseful. You will never suspect what occurs at the end. The unrequited love angle seems almost an afterthought, tho the movie is based on a real story. It tells of the French Foreign Legion (into which no French men are allowed!) during the Algerian struggle for independence. Simon (the ""Deserter"") sees both sides of the struggle and wonders why, in a land so large, Arabs and Europeans cannot live together. Like they had done for generations. Poor Simon, he is so naive one thinks he will not make it out of boot camp. But he is befriended by DuPont (Hardy) and learns through him how to be a soldier and survivor. This is a terrifc movie, another indie, and I would get a copy of it before it goes out of print in both continents. It's worth it.",1265500800,19,1106,4.246445497630332

Murray's story reports on his five years in the Legion in French dominated Algeria.  What sets this story apart is Murray's desire to learn about his host nation and their traditions.

3230782,2,B000X1CRY8,"A poorly put together movie, partly based on historical fact.  Some reviewers seem to have picked up on the line in the film that French nationals were not allowed to join the Legion. While the Legion was created primarily to allow foreigners to serve France, the soldiers were (and still are) always commanded by French Officers.  French nationals were allowed to join and even now constitute about 24% of the serving soldiers.

Apart from that long held (but incorrect) rumor, the basis of the story appears to be accurate.  Unfortunately, the way the movie was put together made it difficult to follow.  Scenes seemed to jump ahead to the next with no carry over so it was difficult to understand.

There are some sweetheart moments, girls doing some dancing, a great drum circle scene, and some mysteries I will not reveal.

Four stars because it was fighting in Algeria where my definitely American father received his Purple Heart for combat injury, during WW2.

 Imagine when the Spanish discovered the ""New World"" and some Spaniards moved to, lets say, Cuba. Now it's 150 years later and you are the 3X removed great grand child of those first immigrants. All you have know is Cuba, as a matter of fact, you see yourself as a Cuban first and a Spaniard second. So now, for reasons you find stupid and unacceptable, the king of Spain tells you, ""you are no longer part of the Spanish empire, that you will be subservient to the Indians, that or you must leave Cuba and move to Spain"". I didn't say ""return to Spain"" because you, nor your parents or their parents, have ever set foot in Spain.
That's the best analogy I can invent for you. It's about you, rightly or wrongly, not wanting to become an Indian.

after his girlfriend Jennifer (Maberly) rejects him. When Simon is rebuffed in love, he
decides to pursue another romantic ambition - fighting for something he believes in. In
the deserts of North Africa he soon meets a man who appears to be his very opposite, the
cynical and world-weary Dupont (Hardy), who fights only for himself. As Simon encounters

3230863,4,B000X1CRY8,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

Simon Murray (Paul Fox) girlfriend has broken up with him. He wants to get far away from her and the pain, so he chooses to join the French Foreign Legion.
His timing couldn't be worse --the Algerian War of Independence (1954-62) was one of the most highly traumatic conflicts for the Foreign Legion.
One of the most unique aspects of the FFL is they are the only unit of the French Army open to people of any nationality.
While going through some very intense training, Simon becomes friends with  fellow Legionnaires Valdes (Aitor Merino), Dupont (Tom Hardy), and Rodriguez (Javier Alcina).
The young men, at first, can't wait to complete their training and go into battle. But as they enter deadly fire fights, ambushes and begin to see the realities of war and politics, they start to wonder, especially Simon.
Dupont tries to show Simon it's important to be a soldier, but more important to survive. But Simon has fallen in love again, this time with Nicole (Felicite de Jeu).  At first, the would be lovers, stand on the same side of the Algerian/French conflict. The more war he sees the more he questions his position and who really is his friend, and his foe.
Back in real life, Tom Hardy's engagement to actress Charlotte Riley could prove a long one. They have been on again, off again. ""You'd have to ask Charlotte when we're getting married,"" Hardy said. ""She's a difficult woman to pin down, as she's always so busy with work.""
They have become patrons of Bowel Cancer UK.",1345593600,,1543,4.707407407407407
3230864,3,B000X1CRY8,"This is a 2002 film that has been re released to shamelessly cash in on the increasingly deserved success of screen hunk, Tom Hardy (`Warrior' etc). It places his name up front but he is not the star. This is the film of the auto biopgraphy by Simon Murray - `Legionnaire'. Murray is played by Paul Fox, who must be related to a side board his acting is so wooden. His previous acting highs have come in the TV soap `Coronation Street' and the voice of Corff the bartender in video game `Dragon Age II'!

Well the plot goes that he gets rebuffed by a lady and in stiff upper lipped fashion he runs off to join the romance of The French Foreign Legion as his hero is Errol Flynn. His timing is pretty off as this coincides with the Algerian awakening for independence and as France has just been kicked out of Vietnam there are not that many places for him to be sent - so Algeria it is.

First he has to suffer boot camp and it is really not a very nice place at all and is actually done rather well. There he meets Mr Hardy playing Dupont a Frenchman. The film follows the ever increasing fractionalisation of the authorities in Algeria as Mr Murray becomes a sort of tourist historian. He goes for walks in the souks and visits mosques to learn about the Islamic culture and it is all a bit cringe worthy, I actually thought this is all a bit history for dummies at one point.

There is some action with explosives and shoot outs and an almost love interest with a certain Nicole - who phoned in her performance. It was all a bit too trite for my liking, if you know zilch about that period of history then this may have more merit as it is there is nothing new to learn here except maybe that  if you get jilted then instead of running off to join the French Foreign Legion  you may want to consider on line dating as an alternative.

Fans of Tom Hardy will not be that impressed with his on screen time either and there are much better films out there; `Battle for Algiers' being a classic and the less well known `Intimate Enemies' is well worth checking out. In English and some French this is a good book that has made an average film, but if you are still interested then I would advise going pour la rental.",1338768000,49,2216,4.251781472684086
3230865,3,B000X1CRY8,"The year is 1960. Simon Murray (Paul Fox) joins the French Foreign Legion because of his romantic notions. It is an iron clad contract for 5 years during which he is sent to Algeria where the Arabs are fighting for Independence. Like ""Full Metal Jacket"" the film takes you through the rigors of training with cruel and sadistic trainers. The diverse group of trainees bond together. Simon supplies us with some boring first person narration to the background of some melancholy French tune.

Simon makes it through training, and life gets better...almost. He gets a ""Dear John"" letter and wants to leave. In town he discovers the locals hate the French and want their independence. His romantic notions have placed him on the wrong side, one that he is committed to be a part. His ideas of life become confused and tested in the reality of life and conflict. There are French and Algerians who are on both sides of the independence movement, primarily for economic reasons.

In many ways this movie mimics the US involvement in Vietnam, and just about any war against colonization. There is a major exception to this film in that...well I will let that one go as that becomes the twist in the tale. And even though it may be history, it was history I was unaware.

The acting was acceptable. The film jumps from scene to scene. You don't know how one scene ends before you are in a scene you wonder how it began. Perhaps this was deliberately done by the director so the audience can feel the confusion of the main character, or maybe it was just poor writing and editing. This is one of those areas where one person sees genius and another sees idiot.

The action is light. The drama involves mostly men. There is next to no humor. Excessive first person narration with a mediocre sound track. A story that is theme heavy.

No-f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Most of the actual killing is off camera.",1329004800,14,1894,4.625

I might watch it again but only because I am in love with Tom Hardy. His character is the best one. You already know that my opinion is biased. The lead character just didn't do anything for me at all. I really can't see that character in the Legion. I really have to blame the actor, the casting person, and the script for this.

The story could have been good, but I wound up getting people confused. I kept asking my friend who watched it with me, ""Is that the one girl or the other girl?"" Some things took too long to develop, and some story elements didn't develop at all.",1318723200,3,690,4.103703703703704

8226464,2,B000X1CRY8,"This is a different kind of a movie, not because of the really bad acting.
But because it talks about the French - Algerian war, and even if it is through
the eyes of a legionnaire, it raises some interesting points about the past of
the ""civilized"" west. Of course, such themes could not be all that popular in
the anti-Arab world of today, but still it is an interesting movie, if you can go
through all the bad acting as I said",1471824000,,430,4.192771084337349
