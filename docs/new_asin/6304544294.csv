7873843,4,6304544294,"I like Elvis quite a bit, and this definately added a new perspective.  As far as giving factual evidence, e.g. live performances and tv appearances, it doesn't do much, but if you've ever enjoyed sitting around hearing people reminisce, then this if for you.  Elvis's friends remember him fondly, but be aware that it wasn't all roses.  Especially enjoyable is hearing his friend Red remember the high school days.  If you love Elvis, you'll love this, and if you're a casual fan, you'll be interested, but you won't want to watch it more than once.",987552000,2,550,4.757894736842105
