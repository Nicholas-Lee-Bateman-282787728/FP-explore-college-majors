862956,5,6304410816,"This is terrific movie to own. It's practically a masterpiece of subtle  and uspoken communication. Liv Tyler is luminously beautiful and Pruitt  Taylor Vince is heartbreakingly great in a part that is so non-verbal that  it's practically a silent film role. The movie proves that a film can be  sweet without being cloying. The photography and music are perfect.  Director James Mangold seems to have lost his way with his recent films,  but this one is a gem.",965692800,7,461,4.846153846153846
862957,4,6304410816,"You might find yourself tapping your fingers with impatience with this slow motion character study, but if you stay with it you might find it indelible.  Director and writer James Mangold is uncompromising in his  determination that we live, breathe, feel and taste this man's loneliness,  his isolation from others and his pitiful desire to find some beauty in his  dreary life.
Pruitt Taylor Vince stars as a fat thirty-something who  still lives with his mother and is the fry cook at her cafe/bar.  I think  he over acts at times, but perhaps that's what makes him so effective.  He  is painful to watch.  Deborah Harry is entirely believable as the trampy  waitress who's seen better days, and Shelley Winters is her natural self as  the mother.  Liv Tyler, daughter of Aerosmith rocker Steve Tyler, and seen  a few years back with Alicia Silverstone in the ""Crazy"" music video, proves  there's more to her than a beautiful figure.
The images, like still  pieces from an art gallery, will stay with you: the breakfast left on the  table for two weeks, the orange juice turning brown; the ugly little black  and white dog: the Pete & Dolly's neon sign in red letters; the dirty  dishes in the sink with the water dripping.  They won't need subtitles for  this one in foreign lands because not much is said.  Mangold eschews  dialogue for the camera.
Memorable are the breathe mints at the end of  the runway and the visit to the Culinary Institute of America.  The best  line is Deborah Harry's sarcastic question (when Vince rejects her blatant  seduction attempt): ""Saving yourself for somebody special?""",963360000,7,1610,4.823529411764706
862958,5,6304410816,"Heavy is just another great slice of US indie movie making. This film has evrything which you can rarely find in Hollywood productions. A story which is well written , great camera work,great acting as well as the music which  fits like a glove. Like everything which is prepared as home made,this film  tastes great ,shining over the big budget movies like a star.

862959,5,6304410816,"This is one of the most underrated and subtle films of it's year.  Director Mangold directs Vince with a subtle style that creeps into your skin long after the film ends.  An excellent example of both the desire and  reluctance to change.  Tyler looks stunning with Winters and Harry adding  superb support.  If you haven't caught it, rent it NOW.  Wonderful and  thought-provoking.",919036800,3,382,4.9523809523809526
863080,5,6304410816,"Heavy is a though provoking masterpiece. The movie does have some long drawn out scenes, but the under laying message of love and acceptance shines clearly through in the end. Deborah Harry of Blondie fame, is a stellar standout, as Delores the waitress. Liv Tyler and Shelley Winters are brilliant. Heavy although not a massive blockbuster, was a top AMERICAN rental for many weeks when it was first released, word of mouth keep it in the rental top 40 for 5 months. Which goes to show you some of the best movies never get their life line. This movie is a must for your DVD collection, even if your just a fan of the Star Material.",1041984000,,633,4.4655172413793105
863081,5,6304410816,"This is an art film.  No question.  A true character study, ""Heavy"" is an encompassing, moody drudgery that unfolds like a once-beautiful wedding dress that has been kept in a box in the attic for twenty years. Deeply unsettling and dismal, the photography itself bears down on your soul with innocent, but disturbing images of a life without purpose.  Squalor.  Deborah Harry's performance as ""Delores"", a one-dimentional waitress at a small-town hash house called ""Pete and Dolly's"" is worth the watch of the entire film.  The interaction between the cast members that takes place in the four walls of Pete and Dolly's down-home setting is very true-to-life by all accounts.  We are all some of what these people are.  That is why ""Heavy"" can be uncomfortable.  You believe in these people that do not believe in themselves.  In ""Heavy"", unsure and hesitant lives are played out flawlessly.  Desperation is sharply and uncomfortably magnified.",1040342400,4,945,5.117647058823529
863082,5,6304410816,"Low-key and slow pace does not detract from this film. This film is *about* how slow and dreary some lives are. Hopeless, afraid of change--that's what almost all these characters have in common.
The ray of sunshine comes with Liv Tyler, a young girl with some hope and light still left in her. She's in danger of letting it be squelched, though, and Vince, the overweight chef she befriends, sees this in her. His ""visions"" of her drowning symbolize his concerns for her--he fears she may drown in the same sea of hopelessness that he (and all around him) already have succumbed to.  The recurring theme of planes flying overheard symbolize hope--going somewhere else, doing something else, getting out of the quagmire of hopelessness that seems to be their destiny.
The actor who plays Vince is absolutely fantastic. He embodies ""quiet desperation"", and our hearts go out to him. And yet at the end, there is hope for Vince. This hope is understated, but there. And we rejoice in it.",1036454400,3,985,4.794117647058823
863083,5,6304410816,Life like and far mind provoking version of forrest gump.  Currently my favourite films.  The last scene is ingenious and offers hope.  Brilliant acting throughout especially victor (Pruitt Taylor Vince).,1027123200,,204,5.733333333333333
863084,5,6304410816,"This is a great movie about a ""heavy"" guy named Victor, and the pain and agony he goes thru just in day to day living. Whether it's a weight problem, a balding problem, whatever makes you feel insecure about yourself, I think almost everyone can relate to his pain of being stuck inside himself. He wants to reach out desperately but the fear of rejection holds him back. The actor conveys so much emotion without words, you can almost feel it thru the screen.
Victor enjoys some companionship for a short while with a guy he meets in the hospital cafeteria. The guy kinda tells him (my paraphrase :-) ), ""I have baggage too, we all have baggage. We're all a lot a like.""
This is a down-to-earth kind of movie with people we can relate to. Like someone else said, this is not the 'Typical Hollywood formula movie."" Amen.",1021852800,2,820,4.473333333333334
863085,4,6304410816,"Heavy is a story about a restaurant and its awkward inhabitants. At the center are two lonely character's in search for something better. The first is an overweight man, Victor, (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who lives with is agitating mother. She complain's and talks so much that he uses his daily reautine of serving her to tone her out. Second is a young woman, Callie, (Liv Tyler) who is hired at the restaurant after recently abandoning college. There is a pure energy between these two people as they begin to face their problems.
Heavy reminded me of of Sling blade in a way. With the exception that even though Carl's sins were more necessary in Sling Blade, Victor's sins in Heavy were a result of depression and desire. The reason for the similarity may lie in the camera work more than the story, but the characerization of purity between Victor and Carl are striking. Victor falls in love with Callie, but won't act apon that love because he fears the way he looks will cause rejection. The trueness of the story comes in my favorite scene when Victor finally realizes that he has a chance and takes it. The touch scene is really heart-felt.
Its a sad movie that ends on a note of hopefullness as though the story could continue on beyond the credits. All of the actors, and the director deserve high credit for this emotional film.",1014681600,2,1337,4.621848739495798
863086,5,6304410816,"Something new under the sun: there's no formula to this picture. Each action and emotion logically follows the one before, instead of being contrived to fit into some form. This isn't hero-wants-girl, hero-loses-weight, hero-gets-girl, or the opposite, where the hero displays the fatal flaw which will hold him back all his life.
If you are used to the Hollywood formula, you won't know what's going to happen next, though by intuition, you will figure it out eventually, because these are real people; you know people like these-- unless you've lived in Levittown all your life, in which case you should see this film because you need the education.
Brilliant performances all around. I bought this video because I'm a Deborah Harry fan, and here she proves her natural acting skills once again. She is so good, it's difficult to remember that in her career, she has not been primarily an actress. Shelley Winters is great. Everyone is wonderful. The lead actor has very few lines, because he is a loner, but he is so good, he communicates without having to speak.
The film is slow-paced, but not plodding. I didn't notice time pass as I watched it. The beat is steady, and I was caught up in its rhythm. I couldn't stop watching, not to eat or let the dog out. This is a beautiful film.",1005350400,9,1289,4.707964601769912
863087,5,6304410816,"I have seen the movie Heavy and Being a fat guy myself, It really hits home for me.  It is the best serious movie I have seen in a long time.  Yeah it's slow paced but it keeps you watching>",1003104000,,190,3.725
863088,3,6304410816,"Granted, ""Heavy"" does have its touching moments and the performances are magnificient. In the end though, I found the movie to be EXTREMELY slow-paced. Maybe it was intended to be slow, in order to show how slow Victor (James Mangold) is because of his weight. Or maybe its a metaphor for how slow his life is. In any case, the slow-pace hurts the movie and doesn't help it. Also Victor should have had more lines of dialogue. I think I heard him say about 4 lines during the ENTIRE MOVIE. Despite its shortcomings, I enjoyed ""Heavy"" somewhat. Worth a rental, nothing more.",996105600,,573,4.627450980392157
863089,5,6304410816,"I realize I'm a very emotional person, but this movie had me sobbing buckets. Great casting! Liv Tyler is amazing, but Pruitt Taylor Vince was especially excellent. With very few lines, his expressive eyes and overall sad composure was heartbreaking. Music fans will love seeing Debbie Harry as an obnoxious, bitter waitress and Lemonhead Evan Dando as a controlling boyfriend.
You really feel for this overweight man. Seeing how difficult each day is and his inner struggle to win Liv Tyler's love is so real.
A must-have for any emotional Indie movie lover.",982195200,2,559,5.021505376344086

7870182,4,6304410816,"Liked it. Low key and engaging. Holds your interest. Mangold's people are real, human, three dimensional,
and to this viewer, that pretty much sums up what most films lack. Why? Because most filmmakers are either shallow or just plain don't get it--or both.

Loved the cast, especially Liv Tyler.
My one and only gripe (if you can call it that) is that I just wish the Victor character could have summoned the courage (somehow) to snap out of his blues (that kept pulling him down and keeping him trapped there.)
Like I say, it's a minor beef. I liked the hell out of this ""unassuming"" tale and stayed with it every step of the way.",1212883200,,632,4.495652173913044
7870183,5,6304410816,"Achingly powerful and vividly emotional film. The casting is perfect and the zen like moments of quiet make this the most emotional and quietly sadly satisfying movie I have ever seen. This is a movie of intense details. From the beautiful Callie, the sad/stuck dreamy Victor, to the bar and the wonderful little dog; all are pieces that fit together perfectly.  The music is quiet and sets the emotional tone. This movie allows the viewer to be with the quiet and pain its characters hold. The tears in this movie are quiet, lonely and heart-breaking. There are a hundred recognizable moments of concentrated life here.  Mangold is a genius with this one. Liv Tyler's performance and moment's with Victor are sublime. People will be watching and appreciating this movie 100 years from now.",1207440000,,790,4.932330827067669
7870184,2,6304410816,"Watching Heavy only confirmed the idea that director James Mangold may be suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder.  He needs medication or at least the ability to complete a thought before he tries to ramble us through another emotional sentence.  Heavy could have been a very complete and emotional film using some raw talent that prior to this had never been explored.  There could have been a very strong story developed behind Pruitt Taylor Vince's character of Victor instead of the inconsistent scenes that I witnessed.  Liv Tyler could have honestly stepped up in the Hollywood atmosphere on this film alone, if she would have just attempted to take one small chance and go outside of herself.  The same could be said for both Shelly Winters and Deborah Harry, who just never felt anything more creative than a walking clich.  Mangold had the power in his hands to really set the stage on fire, but instead we are forced to watch a very inconsistent, obscure, and emotionally voided film that tries to tackle too many issues, without solving any in the long run.

I initially envisioned Heavy's story line to be about a man, concerned about his weight, being the outcast member of society.  At first, and at brief intermittent moments of the film, that was the case, but something changed as the other characters were introduced.  Liv Tyler became a disturbing obsession instead of a passionate, yet simple, love for Victor.  There are scenes in which Vince thinks that he sees a dead Callie walking through his house or even floating in a puddle, but alas, they are only daydreams.  Why were they daydreams?  What was the overall relevance of these scenes?  Was it to show a different side, a troubled side, to Victor, or was it merely used to confuse the audience?  I thought that perhaps she was representing Victor's mother, but even that was stretching a bit.  It was moments like this that really brought a speed bump into this film.  There were other scenes similar to this one that really pulled us away from the central focus of the film, the growth of Victor.  The encounters with Leo seemed forced, and the clichd and random sexual advances of Delores seemed to come out of left field.  The moments between Victor and his mother didn't even feel real.  I felt as if Shelly Winters was speaking from a cue card instead of her heart.  There was one emotional scene where it felt as stale as cardboard, yet it was supposed to evoke tears.  Pathetic.  I felt at times that Mangold had one of those ""Choose your own plot books"" and just randomly flipped through it during this film.

Outside of random plot interjections coming at you from every angle (quite distractingly), there was some decent acting from our lead character Victor played by Pruitt Taylor Vince.  Vince was able to bottle up the emotions of the situations around him very well, the twitching eyes was not something that I thought helped build his character (was that a acting trait or actually Vince's eyes), while the stress eating moments did seem very human.  Vince is a strong actor.  He is typically cast as the psycho in most films, but I thought in this film he did stretch his wings a bit.  It wasn't far, but he brought compassion and emotion to a very forgettable character.  He is the only one worth watching in this film, while the rest of the cast just hurt the film further.  Liv Tyler has trouble acting.  She talks about never taking an acting class before, and in this film you can tell.  She brought nothing new to the screen.  The connection between her and Vince was non-existent.  There was no chemistry, no power, nothing that made me really see a love between the two.  These two have a very silly match.

Outside of the acting and the zigzag plot, there was not much else going for the film.  The music was a tease.  There were some scenes where you would have Vince walking along the road, powerful, emotional, and together, and the music would suddenly change.  Either it was poor editing or just bad music placement, but it seemed to be jumping just as much as Vince's eyes.  It made me cringe in my seat.  I just get extremely worked up about films that claim to be an emotional powerhouse of an independent film, yet it feels like crayons were used instead of the power of the paintbrush.  Again, Mangold had a great film under the surface of all this muck, but it just wasn't worth wading through to get to.

Overall, I was not impressed with this film.  If Mangold would have stayed the course, kept us glued to Vince's powerful character, and developed him using the other minor characters around him, than I think it would have been a winner.  If Liv Tyler would have been a stronger central character and perhaps stepped outside of her lines, than we may have had a winner.  If the point would have been to show a weak man overcome the boundaries of his life, than I think we would have had a winner.  Instead, we are left with unattached moments that come from left field and walking cardboard characters that spit clich lines into the sky instead of to the viewers.  Heavy had so much potential, one can only blame Mangold for all these disasters.  Skip it.  Have yourself a big pizza and watch some Chris Farley films.  Now, there was a big guy that was random, but could at least hold a script together!

Grade: ** out of *****",1128211200,,5350,4.608465608465608
7870185,5,6304410816,"There are really only a few movies that attempt to portray realistic characters going about everyday life in all its ecstasy and agony, and even fewer that succeed in being genuine.  Heavy is one of them, and on that score it probably gets my vote for the best film depiction of what unrequited love actually feels like.  The level of emotional intensity that James Mangold achieves is blistering, as in the scene where Victor retreats to the storeroom and breaks up after the death of his mother, or the ending where Liv Tyler confronts him in the restaurant after he's smashed several dishes.  Unlike other ""realistic"" indie films that concern a mismatched pair (I'm thinking of Garden State or the overrated Lost in Translation), the relationship between Victor and Callie is entirely believable- so much so that at times the film is almost painful to watch.  This is due to the fact that the characters themselves ring true, and for this everyone from Pruitt Taylor Vince to Liv Tyler and Shelly Winters should be commended for their spot-on performances.  James Mangold also manages to inject a little hope at the end without resorting to Hollywood cliches.  It's difficult to find this movie, but I would certainly say it's worth seeking it out.  Parts of it will stay in the back of your mind for years, as has happened with me.",1104969600,14,1335,4.778260869565218
7870186,5,6304410816,"Despite some heavy handed camera work, this film shines.  The acting by the lead character (Pruitt) was outstanding as was the other characters played by Liv Tyler, Deborah Harry and Shelly Winters.  The story backdrop is a small nothing town and shows broken lives and failed chances.  Enter Liv Tyler who appears in a bar applying for a job.  Shelly Winters is the owner and mother of Pruitt - her overweight balding son with a roving eye but a good heart.  The other waitress (Deborah Harry) is none too happy with the addition of a beautiful young woman.  The resident drunk doesn't seem to care.  Besides Liv Tyler's boyfriend, who we don't really see too much, this is it for characters and most of it takes place in the bar yet we barely notice as we are absorbed into the story that unfolds before us.  Predictably, the son falls in love with the new waitress but he never takes a chance because he has already figured out how it would end.  Yet the waitress' life isn't as golden as one would think.  We see glimpses into each character's life and depressing doesn't begin to cover it.  In spite of moments in each character's life that reflect a brillance, they are unable to see it for themselves.  They are too caught up in the misery of their day-to-day existence and it would take too much effort to break free.  At one point the son tries to change and we see hope for the first time burning in his eyes but it's built on lies and we see the consequences....... It's as if you give up on life, life pretty much passes you by and gives up on you - AND the results are there on screen serving as a warning.  Either that or the filmmaker hates small towns and thinks you need to leave to get a better life. The whole mood of this movie is heavy but the sentiment and lush characterization made this movie worth it - repeat viewings even!  A little gem of a movie which prompts me to look for later films by this director.",1100563200,8,1933,4.360335195530726
7870187,3,6304410816,"This is a poignant film that takes place somewhere in upstate New York. Shelly Winters is on her last legs and she runs Pete & Dolly's, a roadside food and beer joint. Her slow-witted, overweight son, Victor is a terrific cook. The regulars are tired and drunk. The waitress is a loser with guys. Liv Tyler shows up in the glory of her youth and changes the stale dynamics. She immediately infatuates Victor.

James Mangold directs and some of his family members help out in this small production. The film and sound are fine and there's a professional look without glossy studio values. Another words, this is a fine independent film made for peanuts because a lot of people believed in the director's vision. Amazing these things ever get off the ground.

I did wonder about half way through the picture if Victor was going to do something yucky with sensitive Liv Tyler, but it's not that kind of picture. Victor doesn't exactly have sex with anyone. This film is a slice of fascinating life. It runs a little slow and possibly it was too long for most audiences. Hell.

7870188,3,6304410816,"The title doesn't merely point to the size of the central character, but also to the entire atmosphere of the film. I had to watch this movie a few times to fully appreciate its subtleness, yet I was intrigued even upon my first viewing.
While the central plot revolves around the ""heavy"" character, the story seems to more so be about Liv Tyler's character and her coming of age in a none-too-friendly environment. While her character does at times seem a bit too contrived and archetypical, you do find yourself nonetheless interested in her fate. In the same vein, you want to know the history of the Debbie Harry character. I was apalled and intrigued at the same time by her performance as a ... waitress. Excellant casting there.
i really appreciate the fact that the film makers never tried to make you feel TOO sorry for the title character. he is gross and close to being a stalker... yet you ""get"" him and his motivation. you almost root for him, until... I don't want to give too much away, but by the end you are truly asking, ""what the...?!"". I can't know why this character would behave as he did, but I am guessing that is the point of the film. Or at least I'd like to think so.
Watch the movie... maybe a couple times. It is worth the time and quite possibly a spirited conversation with your fellow viewers afterwards.",1075248000,10,1336,4.502057613168724
