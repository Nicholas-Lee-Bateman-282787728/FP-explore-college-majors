6395198,5,B00JVWQNI6,This kickboxing dvd is fantastic! I have been losing fat like crazy. I am pouring sweat by the end of the hour. I intend to buy more of his DVDs.,1424736000,,145,3.8666666666666667
6395199,5,B00JVWQNI6,This is a well done kickboxing video. I have several of Guillermo's videos and this is my favorite by far. It's Guillermo alone in a boxing ring and he provides an excellent workout. His cueing is great and he mixes up the moves so you don't get bored of repitition. Often these types of videos repeat the same moves over and over until you get bored and lose interest. This one varies the routine enough to keep you interested and provides a good sweat workout as well. Highly recommended. Hope Guillermo produces more videos like this one.,1424563200,8,541,4.587628865979381
6395200,5,B00JVWQNI6,I absolutely love Guillermo and his kickboxing workouts.  I would recommend this dvd to anybody who enjoys kickboxing.,1424131200,,118,5.555555555555555

6395202,5,B00JVWQNI6,I have several of his dvds.  I love them all. I have lost over 30 lbs thanks to Guillermo.  Wish i could see him in person! He makes you sweat a lot but i never get bored. The moves aren't hard but you will sweat!!,1408665600,6,214,3.7333333333333334
6395203,4,B00JVWQNI6,"I do a number of Kickboxing DVD's.  I study martial arts as well.  I have several dvd's from Martial Fusion.  Guillermo is by himself in this one.  I like this because there is no nonsense.  He motivates, burns calories like crazy and keeps my weight loss maintained.  I also like the power strike dvd's series Amazon sells. Guillermo says if you get comfortable you die.  I agree!  Production is not perfect but it's the instructor that matters to me.  It's by far not bad though.  I just know some are concerned with how a DVD looks.  It is not really hard.  If you have done kickboxing it is the cardio you need to work up to.  The instructor makes sure you burn those calories.  Only other issue for me is I wish I lived near him so I could take a live class.",1403568000,16,763,4.244755244755245

6395207,5,B00JVWQNI6,"This is a great workout. 60 minutes of exercise, every second very well-spent. While I also own the 3 DVD Cardio workouts power pack, this DVD remains my favorite. The intensity is good. The cardio is good. As a runner, I didn't want a workout that would leave me unsatisfied. This kickboxing workout is pure gold. Add the wrist weights and some ankle weights and you're burning calories. Love it!",1453593600,4,397,4.685714285714286

8654109,1,B00JVWQNI6,He's dressed in black with a black background.  He counts in Spanish which is kinda fun but since he and the background are the same color it's hard to see what exactly he's doing.,1484784000,,180,4.294117647058823

8654111,5,B00JVWQNI6,I discovered Guillermo and his wife Jessica through Exercise TV - Sportskool.  This is a great boxing workout; very intense and easy to follow. I wear my step counter and easily get 5000 steps while doing this workout. I recommend this workout,1478390400,3,243,4.785714285714286
