7914676,1,B00001QGJ5,"From the title, one would think that this would be a documentary about the CosPlay phenomenon.  Instead, it is primarily someone with a low-quality camera at a CosPlay convention asking girls (primarily - very few guys interviewed) very similar about their costumes and then ogling them with the camera.

Might be worth renting or borrowing from a friend, but definitely not anything worth keeping in a video/DVD collection.",1232150400,4,424,5.220588235294118
7914677,3,B00001QGJ5,"What happens is this - a news channel takes their camera and asks cosplayers a series of questions, about cost, time it takes to make the outfit and age.  Age???  Well, anyway, the camera angles are bad, either too close or the image is washed out because of the sunlight reflecting off the white or pink of the outfits.  There are some sections that deal with material and what outfits are the most popular but as it deals with Japanese Cosplay the prices they mention and the store they visit don't really help if you live in the US.

Frankly, giving it 3 stars was a tad high, but I'm being nice.",1098748800,5,599,4.321428571428571

7914679,1,B00001QGJ5,"A couple of prurient teenagers hang out at the entryway to a few cosplay conventions with a video camera and a canned list of questions that never varies.  They hit on the ""cutest"" girls they can find (12-14 year olds...).  That's it.  Not at all an introduction to cosplay, no info on how to get involved, how it evolved in Japan or the U.S..  Skip this, it is awful.",1011139200,20,368,4.2898550724637685
7914680,5,B00001QGJ5,It's not out yet but i saw a demo and trailer of it today in fact.  It consites of japanese and american cosplayers and skits they preform.  My first impression was basicallt extatic since there is only one cosplay tape in america and its subbed.  but the whole thing was guys talking to young teen cosplayers in short skirts flirting.  i think this one will have great potencial and especially popular with anime fans.  I would definetally try it out.  ....,1002758400,,458,4.592592592592593
