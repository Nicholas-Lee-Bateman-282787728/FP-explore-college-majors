3176133,5,B0017XFSSI,"When I first saw Jamilla dance I said who is this woman?  I love her style of veil work--spinning into infinity.
Instructions were clear and I can't wait to try them out.  I know it's going to fill my routines with new unbounded excitement.",1216425600,3,240,4.431818181818182
3176134,5,B0017XFSSI,"I was skeptical at first about this DVD as veil has always struck me as a more advanced accessory for bellydance.  I usually prefer my finger cymbals, but I've been wanting to give veil a try, and judging by Petite Jamilla's performances (check her out in the Folies Bergere DVD if you want to know) she knows her stuff.
I am happy to report that this DVD is very well made, and PJ herself gives excellent instructions.  She speaks clearly and doesnt use 'verbage'......anyone from beginner dancer at day 1 to strong intermediates (like me) who are ready to jump into veilwork will enjoy and learn with this DVD.
As most of Miles Copeland's DVDs have, this one features the 'Dancers Cut' selection.  I find this selection always to be helpful since the 'artistic' camara people always like to focus on bellies or bras when what we really want to see is footwork, how the dancer's arms are just so, etc.  Also, there are music credits, as well as a bonus feature interview with PJ.
All in all, I really enjoyed this DVD and already I am feeling more confidant about dancing with double veil.",1216080000,13,1090,4.574358974358974

8267710,5,B0017XFSSI,superbs!... love every single explanations and details how to handle a veil and performances!,1423267200,,93,5.714285714285714
8267711,5,B0017XFSSI,I have rented this video and practiced the exercises and routines many times before I decided to buy it.  There is quite a lot of skill necessary to perform this well and I believe that Petite Jamilla has done a good job of summarizing her years of experience to allow the novice the opportunity to learn some of her techniques.,1357171200,,328,4.466666666666667
8267712,5,B0017XFSSI,"What i like about this video is that it is direct and simple to understand. The movements are fun and take practice, but the instruction is so simple. Less is more here. You get right into the veil and then go into a combination practice. Just the right amount of information is offered here because i doubt i could spin much more than this. I would love for another video to come out with more instruction, but i love what is on my plate for now with this video. Jamilla is an amazing artist. This is an amazing video for all levels.",1308182400,,534,4.245098039215686
8267713,5,B0017XFSSI,"I was not super excited about this video when I ordered it.  However it was a very pleasant suprise. Clear instruction, interesting moves and a beautiful performance. Loved it!",1256342400,,176,5.068965517241379
8267714,2,B0017XFSSI,"Let the buyer beware!

This is NOT an instuctional resource for dancing with double veil.  This video features a lengthy warm up...a scant few well-known SINGLE veil movements and only two double veil figures (also well known and VERY general)

I had hoped for more from this popular and accomplished teacher/dancer. I wish these production companies and their artists would be honest.  This video would be more accurately titled...

The Beginner's brief and very limited Introduction to Dance with Veil.",1242172800,12,504,5.25
8267715,2,B0017XFSSI,"If you already have extensive experience with single veil performance, Petite Jamilla's double veil DVD won't teach you anything that you don't already know.  This DVD teaches about ten veil tricks, most of which you can do with a single veil.  The tricks that were particular to double veil were ones that any advanced dancer could figure out for herself.
For those who are new to veil, this DVD will be fun and enlightening.  For those with more advanced technique, I suggest you skip this DVD.",1226793600,13,496,4.744186046511628
8267716,3,B0017XFSSI,"After reading the other reviews I thought this would be great but was disappointed.

It is filmed well (they use a mirror so the front and back can be seen) & instructions are clear. Her belly dance moves are excellent. How to hold the two veils is done close up. Some moves are shown without the veil so the arm movements are easier to see.

The music is less than inspiring and some of the very simple moves are repeated too often (for example ""strut"" walking forward dragging the  veil behind and walking backwards with the veil in front). It's also done in voice over style which I find to be less engaging.
She only uses one type of veil, semi-circle rayon chiffon with trim.

I found parts to be tiresome just watching it the first time.",1226102400,5,743,4.401459854014599
8267717,5,B0017XFSSI,"Petite Jamilla's Unveiled-Double Veil Instructional DVD is an absolute must buy for every belly dancer. Her instructions are clear and concise, showing the moves both with the veil and without. The dvd is great for both the beginner and the advanced! This is hands down the best veil instructional DVD out there by FAR!!!",1222560000,,321,4.962962962962963
8267718,4,B0017XFSSI,"This is a good DVD for beginners, at a very reasonable price. 10 moves are demonstrated with clear explainations. Of course the double veil usually requires spinning, which does not make it easy for beginning dancers, but with some practice interesting moves can be achieved holding them together in both hands or one in each hand.
At the end there is a performance to illustrate the moves and the concepts demonstrated in the DVD. Also includes a warm-up and a cool down.",1221782400,5,472,4.7682926829268295
