7841024,5,6303182291,"All Tamilee's tapes are good. This one is too. She pushes you just hard enough so that you really feel you've had a workout when you finish, but she's not verbally abusive, like some I could mention. That doesn't work for me. Anyway, most of the exercise videos that I use are hers, and I'm happy with them.",1367798400,,307,4.310344827586207
7841025,5,6303182291,"It's a good workout.

If you're intermediate or more advanced, definitely add ankle weights or you
probably won't even be sore the next day (because I wasn't).

If you're a beginner, watch and enjoy as is.",1288915200,,205,4.666666666666667
7841026,5,6303182291,I love this video...a shame its not in DVD format though. You get a great workout that targets everything from the waist down. Also you start to see result within 14 days. A definite must buy if you can find it.,1222128000,2,211,4.170731707317073
7841027,4,6303182291,"I love Tamilee Webb's videos.  SHe has excellent cuing, the exercise tapes that she makes are really effective (of course if you are consistent!) and she is very non-threatening.  Legs of STeel is a wonderful change from the usual leg exercises and instead of laying down these exercises are performed using a chair for support while standing.
Each area of the thigh and butt (inner, outer, hamstring) is worked with a set of squats in between.  This a a tape in which you will truly feel the burn.
My only complaint are the lunges done at the end of the tape.  Since I am not as strong I had to struggle to maintain proper support.  The tape can also be made more difficult with the addition of ankle weights.
All in all a good bargain but watch your knees.",1001116800,18,758,4.424460431654676
