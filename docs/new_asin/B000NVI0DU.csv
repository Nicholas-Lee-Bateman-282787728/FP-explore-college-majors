2784663,5,B000NVI0DU,"Based on the best-selling novel by Francine Rivers, The Last Sin Eater movie is a faithful adaptation, beautifully capturing the novel's theme of redemption.

Set in 1850's Appalachia, this is the story of ten-year-old Cadi Forbes, a young girl wracked with guilt and longing for her mother's love. Can she ever be forgiven for what she's done? When her beloved Granny dies at the film's beginning the ""passing bell"" is rung, and Cadi is told the Sin Eater will come at nightfall to take away Granny's sins. Above all, she must not look at the Sin Eater. If she does, some of the sins he carries could spill over onto her. But as any curious girl would, Cadi can't help looking into the mysterious and dreadful man's eyes. Who is the Sin Eater? Why is he shunned by the entire community? And can he take away her sins now?

Though filmed in Utah, you'll be hard pressed not to believe every scene took place in the Appalachians. It's noteworthy cast features newcomer Liana Liberato (Cadi) who steals the show with her fresh-faced innocence and her ability to portray a broad spectrum of emotions. Stuart Finley-McLennan isn't the healer he was as Dr. McNeil in the Christy television series, but in this movie he's the one inflicting damage as villain Brogan Kai. Henry Thomas is probably most well-known for his role as Elliott in E.T., but he wonderfully captures the man of God character in this movie. The scenes he shares with Cadi are some of the films most touching moments.

Definitely a family-friendly movie it is surprisingly rated PG-13, though it seemed closer to a PG. Michael Landon, Jr. himself suggests parents watch the film before showing it to young children. This is due to a scene where a man is beaten to death (we see it mostly from a distance) and a massacre later on, although shown with restraint, is still disturbing. Death is a big issue as well giving the film a somewhat dark flavor.

Francine Rivers had final approval of the movie, and she was thrilled with Landon's and co-writer Brian Bird's interpretation. Says Francine, ""I knew from meeting them and hearing about what they believed that they would keep the Gospel at the center, which was my main thing. They really stuck to that and kept the heart of the story. I'm very pleased with what they've done."" The most notable change in adapting the book to film is the absence of Cadi's brother Iwan, but the others are minor and understandable. Taken as a whole it's clear staying true to the book was important. The small budget (reportedly 2.2 million) is only evident in the tree bridge shots, which obviously used green screens.

Reminiscent of the Christy series in setting and tone, The Last Sin Eater makes the Good News compelling. Through Cadi's heart-wrenching journey we are gently shown what redemption is all about--love and forgiveness. And refreshingly, the Gospel isn't apologized for. It's clearly presented without hitting you over the head.

Enriching and uplifting, The Last Sin Eater is what a Christian film should be.

2784886,5,B000NVI0DU,"awesome movie. it has mystery and intrigue that will not let you look away.  surprised that i would say that about a christian movie.  I am too!  it really is well filmed, and has a wonderful message. but it should be screened by parents.  while there is nothing bad in the movie, i think it is wise for parents to watch it before the kids see it so they can be ready to answer questions.  the movie starts out with a little community following an old celtic tradition called sin eating, basically were one man from the community takes the sins for the whole community on himself and condems himself to living a damned life away from everyone.  but a little girl is brought to the realization that the only one able to take sins on himself is Jesus, the son of God, the Savior.  this little girl stands bravely in the face of her family and friends and shows that there is only one way to heaven.  a must see, it even makes me a guy tear up every time i watch it.",1395878400,,963,4.195652173913044

2784888,5,B000NVI0DU,"This is a beautiful movie about the redemption of sinners through what Christ did for us on the cross and through His resurrection.  This movie is also very well done and follows the book, written by Francine Rivers, almost ""word for word""! I would recommend it to everyone.  It may be a bit ""deep"" or even ""scary"" for the little ones to follow though, so, take heed. My eleven year old son doesn't like to watch this movie... it gives him nightmares, even though he knows it is ultimately a story of triumph and victory.  In a couple of years I think he will have a much greater appreciation for it!  So, with that said, I would say it is for 13+ years.",1386806400,,654,4.2926829268292686

2784922,3,B000NVI0DU,"Again, the strong faith of the prinicple characters does not come through clearly. Also the Welsh accents and the almost mumbling voices of the actors make it exceedingly difficult to follow the script.  I think the book is better than the DVD.",1379289600,,244,4.809523809523809
2784923,5,B000NVI0DU,"I was skeptical at the onset of this movie about where it was heading but as it unfolded found it to be just as spiritually moving as it was entertaining. It ultimately points to Christ and the story of redemption.

I really enjoy the historical background of the Celtic immigrants living in the Appalachian mountains in early America.",1377216000,,335,4.775862068965517

I always see something more each time and it just gets better with age! The story is fascinating and very well done.  The young actors especially do an outstanding job with their roles. My emotions are on a roller coaster every time as the events unfold and when you think the movie is nearing an ending, you find that it takes you on an even more adventerousome journey. I never plan to be without this DVD and will continue to watch it three or four times a year! It is also my most lent out DVD.

2784927,3,B000NVI0DU,"Well, books are almost always better, and I've read the book.  Unfortunately, the movie needed to be longer to really do it justice.  Things such as a people living in the mountains with their superstitions do not just change in a moment.  This was a way of life for these people!  Even the most ""dangerous"" person in the movie was in tears at the end.  It just seemed to unrealistic and fast-paced for reality.",1370649600,,411,4.5
2784928,5,B000NVI0DU,I was so jazzed to see a movie made of the book I love so much.  Family oriented and well worth watching.,1370390400,,105,3.772727272727273
2784929,3,B000NVI0DU,"because the movie leaves way too much out that really needed to be included.  Characters are missing,  Cadi, the central character, spends much more time in developement of the plot with other characters than in the movie.

I realize that sometimes material needs to be dropped, but in this case, too much was deleted.  And even the sequence of certain events are transposed.

The violence can be disturbing, but necessary to the story.  The language, let me call it ""mountain culture"", in the book is difficult at first but needed for the story line, and again missing in the movie.

Even the cinematography in spots is poorly done, where it is too obvious a ""back-drop"" picture is being used over  against the primary scene, and with the technology available, totally unexcusable.

Short version, this movie felt like a Afternoon School  Special.  Read the book, you won't be disappointed.",1367107200,,891,4.952702702702703

2784966,4,B000NVI0DU,"This movie, with dark overtones, speaks of the gospel in a positive way.

Cadi is, in a sense, all of us. We carry the sin and guilt of our own actions and inactions. We want to find a way to be rid of the pain and guilt we carry. We seek ways, traditional and new to find a way out of our dilemma.

Cadi tries both, and in so doing also brings dissension within her own community.

Because of the nature of this movie, I recommend that adults watch it before children, but I believe that among teens especially, this movie can open conversations and questions within a group setting.

2785014,5,B000NVI0DU,"what a wonderful story that erases the fear of so many people that think they have to have sacrifice to offer up to God in order to be forgiven and receive salvation.  Spreading the news of the Messiah to the ends of the earth can free prisoners of sin.  We think all have heard, but so many haven't.  Tragic lonliness and rejection in a man's life is so needless through the years. Making one person after another take on the sins of others so that the dead  may be forgiven was futile. 2,ooo years ago Christ took on the sin of the world and paid the price for all forever.  If men of God will go and if only the lost will hear and believe. This movie is not suited to young children since the subject matter is grim and it has a scene of physical violance that is quite disturbing. Importantly, it is a  beautiful illustration of the freedom we are all offered by a most loving savior.  The story is depicted sensitively and dramatically.  I would quickly recommend this piece.",1328486400,,980,4.346153846153846
2785015,3,B000NVI0DU,"Positives:

1) Well made, without a lot of the ""cheesy"" acting you find in some Christian films.  Visuals, directing, music score, and acting all good.
2) Unusual, unique story that will likely hold your interest, even if it does get a bit predictable in places.  It was honestly more entertaining than I expected it to be.

Concerns:

1) I didn't change my rating of the film for this, but it is worthwhile information to know: The story is darker than I expected with violence that I really don't believe is appropriate for younger viewers - especially the violence against the children.  This is NOT ""family friendly"" if your family has children under 13 IMO.  Its PG-13 rating is probably pretty accurate.

2) The ""conversion"" scene, the most critical to the movie, to be honest really bothered me because it was so watered down.  The girl supposedly believed in Jesus and ""received"" His forgiveness and I guess by extension supposedly ""accepted"" Him, yet she didn't even know His name until after-the-fact.  The Bible says that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.  Yet, in this most critical scene of the movie, the preacher/missionary forgoes reading from the Bible or using the Bible to plainly tell her about Jesus (he starts by reading it but not really using it to plainly teach her) and instead merely has her recount her sin.  There's no real discussion of who Jesus is (beyond a one-liner or so) - no mention of really discussing why there is sin and a need for Jesus - why it was final - why there is no more need for a ""sin eater"", etc.  In other words, she really didn't hear much to even have a basis for having any faith in Jesus...which the last time I checked my Bible was an important part of the conversion process.

This would have been much more effective if the preacher, after realizing he wasn't reaching her with his stoic reading from the Bible, instead just simplified his approach by explaining the Scriptures in plain English that the girl COULD understand by meeting her on her level, rather than doing what he did which seemed to be to just set aside the Word of God altogether.

This was the critical scene to the movie and the key part was over in a VERY short period of time, without nearly the expounding needed to really make the connection to Jesus as the ultimate ""sin eater"".

Update 06/2014: I re-watched this movie last night and while my concerna above stand, I think I may have been a bit too harsh.  I did notice a scene I don't think I initially caught after the initial conversion where it was implied (not shown) that the missionary did spend some time explaining the Bible for another character.  Also, I must say, I just plain enjoyed the movie - more so I think than on my first watch a few years back.  I would probably now rate this film as 4 stars, not 3.  This movie is a good showcase of how we all need forgiveness in our lives and need a ""sin eater"" and the story was unique and entertaining.  And though they don't really expound on it much at all, it is at least shown that Jesus is the ""sin eater"" we need.

2785016,5,B000NVI0DU,I purchased this movie so that I could have a movie night with my church youth group. It kept the kid's attention...not an easy task these days with teens. They all really enjoyed it. I don't think I would recommend it for younger youth due to the amount of violence in the film.,1313020800,,279,4.283018867924528

The story follows a young girl, who is burdened with a heavy sin, but she hasn't yet learned about Christ's forgiveness.  Her journey to get rid of her sin leads to discovery of a sad but evil mystery.  This movie keeps you on edge to the very end, when the true meaning of Christ's love is finally understood.

It tells us who the original sin eater was, and why we don't have a need for another one.  It relates the story of Jesus through the story of a young girl growing up in the mountains surrounded by cultish beliefs.  I loved the movie the farther it went along.  I really don't think that Michael Landon Jr. can produce a bad movie.  Between this and the Love Comes Softly Series, his movies are so uplifting, inspiring, etc.  Can't wait for his new movies.

2785040,5,B000NVI0DU,Great movie and a good adaptation of Francine River's movie.  Keeps one on the edge if they never read the book until the surprise ending. Great ending and shows that God will win and work all thing together in the end.,1252108800,,219,4.341463414634147
2785071,5,B000NVI0DU,"Wow, I really enjoyed this movie although it does have some very traumatic moments and because of this I would not let my kids watch it. I would say 17 or older as it really does deal with a lot of ""adult"" issues that may be hard for children to understand. Then on the other hand maybe there are children dealing with similar issues as the little girl in this story and it may very well benefit them. That said, I thought the movie did a great job of illustrating what Christ did for us on the cross. He truly is the last sin eater - only He did it once and for all, for all who will believe. I had not known that this type of belief (religion) existed (sin eater) and found it truly interesting and ironic. It only further proves to me that everyone has a desire and need to be forgiven of their sins because that is how God created us. The ""sin eater"" obviously is one of the many ways that people try to handle their sins ""their way"". But just like in the movie, it's only God's way that truly works; nothing else!",1242172800,,1018,4.1206030150753765

2785074,1,B000NVI0DU,"From the cover and the summary/blurbs, *The Last Sin Eater* looked like an interesting movie and maybe perhaps similar to *The Village*.  Boy, was I wrong!

Initially, it looked like it was going to be a good movie.  Cadi, a little girl, has a mother who is just withdrawn.  We soon learn that Cadi used to have a younger sister and the mother just has not been able to handle this absence.

Meanwhile, Cadi has an enigmatic conversation with her grandmother before she dies.  At the funeral, she is warned that the Sin Eater will visit her grandmother's body and she is instructed not to look.

Interesting, so far.  However, when the sin eater arrives and Cadi peeks, you'll see it is an ordinary man in a hooded cloak.  I thought...what is this?!?!  I tell myself to be patient.  However, when Cadi is visited by a mysterious ghostly girl, I had enough of this cheesiness.

So, I didn't finish it.  Upon reading the reviews here, there seems to be a mixed reaction to the movie.  Apparently, this is a Christian movie, which doesn't bother me, but a dark one.  O...k!  Just don't compare this to *Little House on the Prairie*.  LHTP was not dark.",1233532800,5,1149,4.553921568627451
2785075,4,B000NVI0DU,"Based on the actual practice of the Welsh who settled in the Appalachian Mountains during the 18th & 19th centuries and the novel of the same name by Francine Rivers. The sin eater was someone in the community, picked by God through lottery, who was set apart to live alone, and only showed up at the burial site to perform a ritual of taking the dead person's sins upon himself, making the person acceptable to God in the afterlife. No one ever saw the Sin Eater. The story centers around young Cadi Forbes, whose sister died recently in an accident, and the guilt she feels for her death. She can't stand living with the guilt and can't wait until death to have her sins removed , so she seeks this elusive and strange person called the Sin Eater. In doing so, she confronts the demons and dark secrets that have haunted the community for decades. Who is this mysterious Sin Eater, where does he live and can he remove the sins of the living as well as the dead? While the film has a clear Christian message, it is intended for all audiences and is more than just an excuse to make a 'video sermon'. The story is well done, the scenery is gorgeous and the acting is more than adequate, all done on a relatively small budget. Reading the book is a plus in understanding as it would be helpful to have a little better knowledge of the role of the Sin Eater and the cause of Cadi's guilt a little earlier in the film. Produced as part of the FoxFaith Series. It will be over the head of and a little too violent for most children under 13. [...]",1233360000,3,1544,4.309278350515464

2785080,1,B000NVI0DU,"I was fine with this film until the main character said the word ""Okay.""

Then, later in the story, another character, the main character's father, said it over, and over, and over.

Welsh immigrants, coming to Appalachia in the mid nineteenth century, DID NOT USE this particular colloquialism!!

At that point, for me, the movie lost all credibility.

Further, I do not think, but can't be 100% sure, that bright pink would have been an accurate color for the little girl's pinafore in that place, and at that time.

As a former living history presenter, I am relatively certain, though, that this modern, analine-type dye color was not correct for the ""period.""

I also know for a fact that the Welsh were completely Christianized by this time in history.

Therefore, these people would have not only KNOWN about Jesus Christ...but they would likely have been the ones preaching His word!  The Welsh are nothing if not zealous Christians!

Perhaps, however, that is a flaw that comes from the original book.  I have not read it.

Anyway, I feel that the screenwriters, editors, and costume designers should have done their historical research much more thoroughly.",1222560000,7,1167,4.963917525773196

The main character is a little girl living in a small Appalachian cove that has endured the tragic loss of a kid sister whom she blames herself for her death. She has one true friend, a boy named Fagan, whose father is a sinful avaricious tyrant. Together, with the hand of God, they set out to make the terrible sins of the cove village people right. Don't want to give away to much... but it is a beautiful story that is suitable for all ages. This movie has not had much publicity, which saddens me deeply, for it is a magnificent captivating tale. The actors and the movie itself deserve much more. It is disappointing that we live in a time where movies like 8 mile and Jason receive Hollywood's attention. Perhaps that is why children like the sweet innocent kids portrayed in this movie no longer exist.",1214956800,,880,4.472049689440993

We do not have small children at home but I'm sure any child over 10 would have understood the limited violence in the movie. It's dark moments were spooky not scary. This is definitely a movie based on Christianity and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a Christian. The only thing I have to say poorly about it is that the accents were horrible. They were supposed to be Welsh but sounded like bad Irish accents. In fact the accents were so bad that the only actor who was Welsh sounded like he was speaking a different language than the others.,1213660800,2,637,4.452991452991453

Cadi thinks she caused the death of her sister and needs the sin eater to eat her sins. She then meets a travelling preacher who tells her about Jesus.

For such a bad story, the movie certainly goes on for far too long, at almost two boring hours and the acting doesn't make it any better. Liana Liberato (Cadi) is one of the few actors in the movie who do a decent job. The rest range from awkward to awful. Not even the great Louise Fletcher gives a good performance. The accent all sound fake; Henry Thomas is especially painful to hear.

There is one scene towards the end that makes me give the movie a weak 2 star rating instead of one. Recommended only for fans of sentimental evangelical movies. Others should stay away.",1209427200,4,887,4.435582822085889
2785119,5,B000NVI0DU,"There is plenty of reviews to tell you about the movie.  Just additional accolades here. We bought it knowing it was based upon a book by Francine Rivers. My wife and I have never been disappointed with any of her books--thus we purchased the DVD. We also own the book, The last Sin Eater by Rivers. Both are 5 stars. Books and movies are never exactly the same, books provide more story but take longer to read than viewing a movie. Book lovers, alas, always complain about what was left out. This movie stands on it's own.

Director, writer, and producer Michael Landon, Jr. has done an outstanding job of creating a thrilling story without shying away from the Biblical truth it holds. Jesus Christ was the Last Sin Eater, and the poor chap chosen by the mountain neighborhood to sacrifice his own soul on their behalf was false and unnecessary. Some of the negative reviews on this movie may have come from viewers convicted by the underlying truth. As a Christian, I did not find the religious emphasis strong or out of place.

Most movies I can watch and set aside for a few years before reviewing the same story.  Not this one. It is special.  I was ready to watch again immediately. My only complaint is that the extra features ran out before I was tired of watching all that was included in The Last Sin Eater DVD.

This is a breathe of fresh air to contemporary cinema as much as the unveiling of truth and the false need of the sin eater was to the story's characters.  A fine book/movie for every sinner, and the story explains everyone is a sinner.  It takes the younger generation and a murdered man of God in this Welsh community to expose the truth.  Cadi, a courageous young girl in the story leads the way.

Many Christian films have very poor acting or bad scripting, but occassionally you get lucky and find a real gem - this film is definitely a gem. Our Youth Group loved it so much, that they told their parents' they needed to see it too.

Not that there is anything wrong with that, but the acting and the cinematography were average at best. ""The Last Sin  Eater"" is a great family film, with a wonderful message about Christ's redemption of mankind. I really liked the actors, especially  Liana Limberto performance. She really made Cadi Forbes a very believable
character. I also enjoyed the music in the film, as well, as some of the scenery. I would not recommend this for younger children, maybe ten and under. It was a little spooky at times, but not in a horror film kind of way. It was mostly just the subject matter of death, and the graveyard scenes that might be scary for some kids. I would recommend this film to anyone, especially those who were ""Little House On The Prairie"" fans. I kept thinking throughout the film how much it reminded me of ""Little House"". Perhaps, it is because the director is Michael Landon's son. In the end, I would say give ""The Last Sin Eater"" a chance, and when you watch it remember how far Christian films have come and be thankful.",1198022400,,1143,4.653465346534653

The acting was uniformly excellent (surprisingly so!) The 10 seconds before the father rings the bell near the beginning of the movie really grabbed me, that actor did such a phenomenal job. There were a couple of SFX awkwardnesses and the girl's dresses were way too fancy for the lifestyle she led, but these details were minor and they didn't take away from my engrossment with the story. Every character was well motivated and no one was two dimensional, all evil or all good. I basically spent the last 30 minutes of the movie crying. I've never cried for that long in a movie before. Powerful stuff! I heartily recommend this movie.",1193616000,,849,4.629139072847682
2785154,5,B000NVI0DU,"Simply put, The Sin Eater is what a Christian movie should be.  I have more than 2,700 DVD movies related in some way with children and teens, and this one comes in very, very near the top.  One of my pet peeves is so-called Christian movies that preach their way through the story, or that try to ram Christianity down one's 'throat,' apparently because the producers think it would be their only chance to convert you.  This movie is completely free of any kind of preaching.  Any attempt to convert anyone is by example, not preaching.

The 'Stranger' does say a prayer, but it is done clearly to draw Cadi's attention.  [He is unaware of her presence, but what he is saying peaks Cadi's curiosity about him.]  Wisely, the stranger first shows genuine (and, to her, unexpected) concern about what is troubling Cadi so.  When she explains that she needs a sineater now, not after she is dead, Stranger explains to her that she can let the Original 'Sineater' take that pain from her.  The name of Jesus is mentioned only once, and it's only when Cadi asks if the Original Sineater had a name.  In other words, he brought the Christian message to her on her terms and understanding.

Some have complained that it didn't seem realistic that the whole little society would become Christians through what a little girl brought to them.  However, in 1910 a single copy of the Gospel of John fell into the hands of the Hmar people in a remote region of India, and the whole village converted, without even a missionary to teach them.  See ""Beyond the Next Mountain"" for that true story on DVD.

Another important element of this movie is that it is quite compelling and entertaining.  A neighbor watched my copy of the DVD, and he and his wife couldn't even answer the phone when it rang as they watched the movie, they were so captivated by the story.  It is a very emotional movie, and many will find a lump in their throat and a wisp of tears in their eyes as they relate to the indescribable pain Cadi feels as a result of her 'sin.'  Every person of religious faith I've shown this movie to comes away saying it is one of the very best movies with a (subtle) Christian message they've ever seen.

If your little girl likes this movie, I'd recommend another movie entitled ""Second Chances,' starring: Kelsey Mulrooney, Terry Moore and Directed by: James Fargo.  [As I write this, Amazon.com carries is, and it is available from 24 associated Amazon.com sellers.]

I enjoyed the book several years ago and hesitated to watch the movie because so often the movie is not as good as the book.  I was pleasantly surprised on a few counts.  First, the movie WAS as good as the book and was true to the story.  The casting was excellent without the million dollar names.  Usually a Christian family film will come across as low budget but this was extremely well done with great screenplay and acting and gorgeous scenery.  Secondly, the movie represented the gospel of Jesus Christ in a very interesting and historical storyline without an obnoxious or overly obvious attempt at evangelism.  Another thing about Francine, is that she is not afraid of bringing real humanity into her stories!  There are some harsh and abusive scenes in this movie which I didn't particularly enjoy watching but I feel increased the quality of the film.  Her story really came alive in this DVD and I highly recommend it.

2785187,5,B000NVI0DU,"The Last Sin Eater is a wonderful tale of redemption, forgiveness, and mystery.

Cadi Forbes is a troubled young girl about her past. But everything starts with her granny's death. Her father rings the ""passing bell"" as all in the Appalachian mountains gather at night for the funeral and a Celtic ritual. The ritual has a person chosen from the clan by casting lots and the one chosen is called the, ""Sin Eater."" The Sin Eater is sent to the mountains forever banished to have contact with his clan. He only comes down from Dead Man's Mountain to someone's funeral. So, at the granny's funeral, the Sin Eater comes out and eats bread and wine off the dead lady's stomach. He says he pawns his own soul on her to eat up her sins. Cadi is overcome by curiosity and turns around to see the Sin Eater. No one finds out until later, but they say if you look at the Sin Eater, evil gets a hold of you.

Cadi is forced to make a decision to see this Sin Eater to eat away her sins. Her past contains a tragedy she feels utterly responsible for. But when she overhears a devastating conversation between her parents, she feels more determined.

After a futile attempt of the Sin Eater to eat Cadi's sins, Cadi suddenly finds a stranger in their mountains. No one knows him and he is referred to as the ""man of God"". Cadi forms a friendship with this man and pours out the secret of her past to him. This is when Cadi first hears about another Sin Eater, the orignial Sin Eater. The ""man of God"" tells her about Jesus and she becomes saved.

Cadi is then thrown into a mystery of her people's past. She and Fagan, her friend, are unexpectedly found under the shelter of the Sin Eater. Here they discover a tunnel full of drawings that point to Fagan's grandfather who's life was full of sin. And after they are commanded to leave from the Sin Eater himself, they confide in Miz Elda about their findings and discover the truth about Fagan's grandfather.
They ring the ""passing bell"" and all gather for this fake call. Fagan's father, Brogan Kai, demands who rang it, but instead of a submissive answer, Miz Elda confronts him about his father's past sin. The sad tale pours out and with that the Sin Eater realizes his own misplaced destiny. The ultimate truth reveals itself and forgiveness takes place.

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys redemption and forgiveness stories. Though there are many other things to tell about this intriguing movie, you will have to watch to find out. Overall, the acting was superb for unknown actors and it was very believable as it grabs at your emotions.",1185148800,4,2592,4.506382978723404

So many times, a story doesn't live up to what the book before it did.  But this was an exception.  Michael Landon, Jr. did it justice.  The feel of the book, kind of a dark, mystical existance for these people came through on screen to perfection.  There was some disappointment in the building of certain characters, like Cali's mother but only so much can be done in a 2 hour movie when the book was so meaty.  For those who haven't read the book, it may take a couple of viewings to pick up on all the details of the story but this is a very good film and watching it over and over, shouldn't be a problem.",1182816000,3,761,4.073825503355705

2785193,2,B000NVI0DU,"This movie is like a horror version of Little House on the Prairie.

Warning: Do not show this film to young or sensitive children, especially those who struggle with guilt, depression and suicidal thoughts.  There are many scenes of death in this movie, and at least two where Cadi balances on a slippery log over a high chasm and contemplates suicide as the just consequence of her perceived guilt.  For those who are prone to excessive guilt or depression, the movie will be very unpleasant at best and perhaps life-threatening at worst.

A great drama may include some very disturbing elements but will weave the seeds of a satisfying ending all through so that the ending, when it comes, feels natural and logical.  By contrast, several plot twists in The Last Sin Eater, especially its ending seem pasted in, unnatural, and abrupt.  Would all the adults of a village really abandon their pagan beliefs, shed their guilt, and turn from cruelty to kindness just because a girl informed them that they had it wrong?  I believe in the saving power of Jesus, but even as a sympathetic viewer, I couldn't suspend my disbelief when a character changed abruptly for no apparent reason.

Therefore, the ending adds to the dark, sinister feeling of the movie instead of being redemptive as it is supposed to be.  It's almost like the villagers turn into zombies or are controlled by some dark force pretending to be light.

I wonder if the plot disconnects were due to the director or the editor?

I want more films which reflect Christian values.  But being a Christian doesn't make me into a movie-going Mikey (give it to Mikey, he'll eat anything!).  I've been disappointed by several ""Christian"" movies in the past year.  Give me movies which tell a great story and are well written, acted, directed, and produced.

I do give this movie two stars, not one.  I liked the acting by the children, particularly Liana Liberato as Cadi Forbes and Soren Fulton as Fagan Kai.  Thea Rose as Lilybet was appropriately angelic, but would have been much more interesting if her character had been developed some more.  As it was, she was a cute messenger girl for God, little else.  That's not her fault, of course.

I also liked the cinematography, which richly conveyed the beautiful location and simple lifestyle of the residents.",1182643200,14,2321,4.813131313131313
2785214,2,B000NVI0DU,"According to ancient Celtic tradition, a ""sin eater"" is a person chosen by lottery to take the transgressions of others onto his soul so that the newly deceased can pass over to the great-beyond free of the stain of iniquity.

""The Last Sin Eater,"" the latest offering from FoxFaith Films (the branch of Twentieth Century Fox Studios that specializes in Christian-friendly moviemaking) is a well-meaning but leaden and strangely eclectic work, sort of ""The Village"" meets ""The Old Time Gospel Hour"" meets ""Little House on the Prairie"" (no surprise in this last one, since the movie was directed and co-written by Michael Landon Jr.).  Cali Forbes is a sweet-natured young girl, growing up in early 19th Century Appalachia, who believes that a mysterious hooded hermit - the local ""sin-eater"" - will be able to take away the guilt she feels over ""causing"" the death of her little sister in a river accident.  She spends most of the movie seeking him out, much to the consternation of her parents and the myriad ""colorful"" folk who inhabit their little cove.  However, it isn't until Cali encounters a wandering preacher (played by E.T.'s now-grownup buddy, Henry Thomas) that she learns who the ""true"" sin-eater really is (though one wonders how anyone in this particular time and place can be as woefully ignorant about the gospel as the people here seem to be).

Although the first half of the movie achieves a certain portentous creepiness in its tone and atmosphere, once the evangelist shows up, the movie devolves into an overwrought melodrama, marked by stilted dialogue, holier-than-thou speechifying and heavy-handed sentimentality.  The acting, even on the part of Thomas and Louise Fletcher, is generally amateurish and wooden, although young Liana Liberato as Cali has a natural dignity and poise that work well on screen.  And, oh yes, the scenery is eye-popping and gorgeous.

Based on the novel by Francine Rivers, ""The Last Sin Eater"" clearly has its heart in the right place, but good intentions alone can't make it a satisfying movie.",1182643200,11,2051,5.047337278106509
2785215,4,B000NVI0DU,"Released in '06 the Christian film 'The Last Sin Eater' is a classic case of the old adage, ""The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.""

Synopsis: A 19th century Welsh community residing in the Appalachian mountains hides a terrible secret about the past and their ongoing need for a ""sin eater"" to absolve their transgressions. Little ten year old Cadie also hides a dark secret of her own and her quest to find forgiveness exposes more about herself and her neighbors than she could have ever imagined.

2785218,4,B000NVI0DU,"""The Last Sin Eater"", based on the Francine Rivers novel, is a wonderful tale of redemption set in 1850's Appalachia.  I loved the book (which I have also reviewed), and found this movie to be a mostly faithful and enjoyable adaptation.

Liana Liberato delivers a great performance as Cadi, a young girl seeking release from the weight of guilt that has burdened her since the death of her little sister.  Elizabeth Lackey, who plays Cadi's mother, does a great job, too -- they have one scene together at the end that just about had me bawling.  The rest of the cast is good as well, especially Peter Wingfield as the title character.  His role was very challenging; since his face is hidden until the last few moments, he has only his voice with which to move us, and move us he does.

My only disappointment with the film was that it didn't do as good a job of telling the story as I would have liked.  I watched the movie with my parents and found myself having to explain a few plot points.  For example, when Cadi overhears her father say to her mother, ""So you wish Cadi had died instead?"" my parents thought ""instead"" meant ""instead of Cadi's grandmother"", who had passed away in the opening scene.  A few of the other subtleties of the story could have been fleshed out a bit, too.  At times it felt hurried, and would have benefited from a slightly longer run time.  For example, I would like to have learned a little bit more about the Man of God and what motivated him to enter the remote valley.

The Gospel as presented here is somewhat brief, although to the film's credit it does make it clear that 1)we need to be sorry for our sins and 2) only Jesus can grant forgiveness.

""The Last Sin Eater"" makes for excellent family viewing and I heartily recommend it.  You'll enjoy (and understand) it more, though, if you've already read the book.",1181001600,6,1857,4.471810089020772

2785235,5,B000NVI0DU,"At heart this is a tale of faith, and how a community learns to cast away their fear, superstitions and past sins & redeem themselves. The lead character is young Cadi Forbes [played brilliantly by Liana Liberato]who carries a heavy burden of guilt as she feels responsible for her younger sister's death. At her grandmother's funeral, she looks upon the 'sin-eater', a person chosen by the community to lead a life of isolation, only to appear at funerals and 'consume' the sins of the dead so that they may rest in peace. Intent upon having her own sins absolved, Cadi sets out on a journey of hope, and tries to find the sin eater. Not only does she find him, but discovers that the community is not completely clear of conscience themselves, and it takes a man of faith to make her and the rest see the truth. The acting in this movie is above average...young Liana Liberato is able to convincingly evoke feelings of fear, guilt and hope, and the sin eater himself is adept at portraying his hopeless situation. The villain of the movie is played by Stuart Finlay Mclennan [who was the doctor in Christy] and he does a good job of playing an ignorant & power crazy maniac. There are also good supporting roles such as Thomas Howell as the preacher. The cinematography is lush and evokes the captivating beauty of the mountains, and the costumes are beautiful [though a bit too elaborate for people eking out a meager living in the mountains].

Cady thinks the 'sin eater' in their village can cure her like he forgives all the people in their village by eating foods left for 'sin eater' and redemption is automatically in place. Nevertheless, she still feels guilt after asking their village 'sin eater' to eat the bread she's left for her sins, until she finds a real preacher that's been cast out of their village by the locals for trying to spread the Word of Jesus. (They all think he's crazy, because the town already has a 'sin eater'). They think he's the work of the devil until Cady speaks with him and finds forgiveness through prayer to the Lord.

In striving for redemption for herself, she also finds the way to bring peace to her whole village, and especially to the man who has given up his life to become the dreaded Sin Eater. One of the best things about this movie is that it does not shy away from expressing the tremendous heart-hunger that exists not only in young Cadi, but as it turns out, in everyone. It is very direct in showing the disappointment in a ""solution"" that doesn't work. It is also very respectful and honest about the Christian faith. It does not twist or distort Christian doctrine, and indeed is one of very few movies I have seen in which a devoutly Christian character does not in the end turn out to be crazy or hypocritical, but honorable and faithful to the end. The only complaints one might have about this film is the rather annoying device of blacking out the picture multiple times in the first flashback scene, and also that the computer animation of the river was rather poorly done. Nonetheless, this film is definitely worth watching. Bring your kleenex!  (some violence--may be inappropriate for young or sensitive children.)",1179360000,6,1317,4.8017621145374445

Screenplay by Brian Bird and Michael Landon, Jr., based on the novel by Francine Rivers. Edited and directed by Michael Landon, Jr. (FoxFaith, 2007, Color, 141 minutes. MPAA Rating: PG-13).

Another costume drama, The Last Sin Eater tells a tale of redemption strikingly similar to Pan's Labyrinth through its heroine, another girl on the cusp of adolescence and responsibility of adulthood. They also share a similar plot structure (the ordeal) and even the same stock characters. However, the two are worlds apart.

The fledgling FoxFaith line of inspirational Christian movies released this picture. To me, it's kind of ""made for TV"" filmmaking that's like the proverbial fingernails dragged down the chalkboard: Awkward, dramatically inconsistent performances (especially among the children actors); uneven pacing and slack editing; generic-looking costumes and sets; inter-cutting of 35mm location shots with what appears to be 16mm stock footage; and, a director who uses embarrassingly primitive special effects like ""Chroma-Key"" bluescreen process, which Alfred Hitchcock deemed obsolete as long ago as 1962, when he made his terror classic The Birds. Dismissed by most reviewers, don't hold your breath waiting for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences to bestow its cherished imprimatur upon this ""nice try"" by a director whom the producers should have barred from the editing room.

And, although readers might think I'm gearing up to ""pan"" another film (pun intended), think twice. Why? Because, since I was a kid, I don't watch movies simply to revel in their technical merits. I go because I want to be entertained, perhaps even enlightened, by a great story.

The technically virtuosic Pan's Labyrinth left me cold because it was all style and no substance. Yet, despite its glaring aesthetic deficits, I loved this one precisely because it had the crucial ingredient the former lacked: A great story. More so than its message, a movie's story is its soul.

The Last Sin Eater takes place in a Welsh settlement in 1850s Appalachia. Ten year-old Cadi Forbes (Liana Liberato) hides a dark secret that weighs heavy on her conscience. She tries hard to repress it, but an incident at her grandmother's funeral reopens the barely-healed wound.

At her burial, something's horribly amiss: The ceremony, bereft of comforting eulogy, seems more of a witch's sabbath than a passing onto the next life. Held under the cover of darkness, Cadi's granny lies in state before the silent mourners, a piece of bread and a bladder full of wine lying on her chest.

Cutting through the eerie stillness, a hooded figure appears, the Sin Eater (Peter Wingfield). He scarfs down the bread and gulps the wine, and in a sorrowful voice--having cleansed the old woman's sins by condemning his own soul--recites a solemn wish for her forgiveness. No one looks at or speaks to the Sin Eater (it's rumored that the very act of communicating with the wretched outcast brings eternal damnation) but while everyone's heads are gravely bowed, Cadi hears something painful yet oddly benign in his voice. She doesn't fear looking into his eyes, because she already feels doomed by her transgression.

Cadi's identification with the Sin Eater soon becomes an obsession: Unable to live with herself, a couple days later she seeks him out. She goes into the mountains to find him, despite others' warnings.

Here is real heroism: Cadi's refusal to heed superstitious gossip and deny the evidence of her own experience buttresses her resolve to forge on in her quest. We soon learn her secret--her sister's accidental death, by falling off a tree bridge over a waterfall--was prompted, partly, by Cadi's stubbornness. However, her very intransigence is also the key to her eventual redemption.

Around this point, the plot comes to a standstill as it meanders. Unable to take the clumsy dialogue of the three child actors, I get ready to exit the theater. Only one thing keeps me pinned in my seat: What will happen next?

Cadi eventually tracks down the Sin Eater to his secret cave, he reluctantly performs the sin eating rite, never having done it for a living person. She feels nothing, and descends the mountain just as encumbered as she was going up.

On her way home, she happens upon a Man of God (Henry Thomas) alone and preaching the gospel to no one in particular along the river. Seeing that she's troubled, he gets her to open up about her predicament. He laughs, and divulges to Cadi that the mortal Sin Eater cannot relieve her guilt, that long ago there was a true sin eater named Jesus Christ, whose grace has made it possible for her to be forgiven for her sins while still alive, rather than having to wear them like an albatross around her neck until death.

Suddenly, Cadi feels the weight of the world lifted from her shoulders. She runs to tell everyone. ""Know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.""

But now the mystery has just begun. Why is the immigrant enclave ignorant of this common knowledge of Christ's salvation? Why must a doomed man endure ostracism, serving a miserable sentence performing atavistic pagan rituals?  And why does village bully Brogan Kai (Stewart Finlay-McLennan, whose thuggish performance recalls Ward Bond and George Kennedy) corner the Man of God, killing this ""outsider,"" lest his words reach the village?

As Cadi hides from Brogan, she returns to the mountain, where we find out the settlers' real sin, a secret that's haunted two generations. Cadi tells the Sin Eater the good news, but he's unable to accept the tragic fate of having been denied the love of the woman he loved, fathering children and a purposeful, fulfilling life for naught. His agony resonates deeply as he begs her off. ""It means I will have wasted twenty years of my life in this cave and never saved a single soul from damnation,"" he cries, breaking down.

Being an old-fashioned movie, Louise Fletcher (best known for her Oscar-winning role of sadistic Nurse Ratched in 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) as village elder Miz Elda is the movie's Deux ex machina, who calls a town meeting that night to divulge the secret. Her testimony opens up a lot of old wounds, but, rather than burning the village to the ground a la avenging angel Clint Eastwood in his 1973 revenge fantasy High Plains Drifter, Elda's words instead lift the shadows of superstition and scapegoating that kept them in darkness.

The Sin Eater renounces his dark avocation, becomes a preacher and saves souls instead in the sunlight by the river. The movie closes with Cadi exclaiming its moral, that she's been set free because Christ died for her sins. Not very subtle, but consider the context and target audience.

But, that audience already knows that bit of information. The moral was a rather ingenious MacGuffin for a life-affirming message that sin is an aberration, not man's constant state and a this-worldly metaphysics that individuals have the inherent right and dignity to live as men, not objects of sacrifice. In other words, ""Jesus died for our sins, so now we can all get on with the business of living.""

Maybe it's not just the sex, moral decadence and profanity driving the faithful to these new religious pictures. From the looks of this one, maybe it's not only preaching to the choir, either. Perhaps, just like everyone else staying away in droves from movie theaters nowadays, they too just want to see motion pictures that tell fascinating stories, project a benevolent sense of life and present man as clean, heroic, and productive.

And maybe, just maybe, they're getting fed-up with being patronized as unsophisticated rubes for wanting everybody to live--horror of horrors--happily ever after.",1174780800,22,8002,5.056145675265554

8181832,5,B000NVI0DU,"I love this film. Shared it with someone who never returned it and had to purchase another copy to have in my library.  Produced by Michael Landon's son it is, not unexpectedly, a film that deals with the human relationship to God.  The misconception that man can work to get right with God is completely dispelled by this film using a ritualistic, backward form of religion as the example.  It is a good movie, very family friendly and not afraid of bringing God's truth to light.  Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.  No man comes to the Father but by Him through the finished work of the Cross.",1470614400,,603,4.396396396396397
