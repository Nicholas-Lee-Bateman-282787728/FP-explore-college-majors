8516919,5,B007HW8TSO,I have watched this show several times since I've purchased it. It's just so good. everyone in it is at the top of their game. Jack O'Connell is going to take Hollywood by storm and this tv show proves it. Allan Cummings is perfectly casted in this role. Can't get any better than him in all his Desrae glory. Very well written and performed. Wish i could find the book.,1463097600,,370,4.3

8516921,5,B007HW8TSO,"I loved The Take and couldn't wait to watch this knowing the same mind was behind it. Tom Hardy is in the Take and this has Jack O'Connell in it, they are two of my all time favorite actors so I was in love with both series from the get go. The story line is very dramatic and keeps you wondering what's gonna happen next. Incredible performances from many of the cast. It's very well done. If you like it you should definitely watch The Take. Outstanding performance from Tom Hardy. I've watched both of these several times and still love them",1435622400,,544,4.3431372549019605

8516925,5,B007HW8TSO,"Although this series succeeds beautifully as a crime drama and a romance, there's more going on than one might at first think.  I have not read the novel on which this program is based, but at the very least the adaptors of Cole's story, if not Cole herself, have put together a stylish twist on the classic literary quest for redemption. Whether or not the creators of ""The Runaway"" intended to reference Graham Greene's ""Brighton Rock,"" I couldn't help seeing Eamon as a slightly more appealing counterpart of Greene's Pinky Brown, and his struggle as parallel to Pinky's conflict over alone-ness and connection.  The production also shares Greene's concern for the divide between various systems of morality and gives at least a nod to Greene's exploration of the role of faith, and particularly Catholicism, in a fallen world.  In other words, this is a great show that reminds me of one of my favorite books.  As in ""Brighton Rock,"" the story comes to an easily forseen conclusion, but it still is emotionally evocative...I can't remember what else I've seen recently that made me feel much of anything.",1342828800,,1108,4.909090909090909
8516926,5,B007HW8TSO,"Two people grow up together in the middle of London's gangs. They were childhood sweethearts who witnessed violence, drugs, prostitution, and more all around them. As the streets filled up with drugs, rape and murder, their lives were torn apart as they ran away in different directions, until they meet again. This action-packed crime story has you hooked from the start with intense suspense throughout. A heart-wrenching story of crime, corruption, and survival. Drama throughout, acting performance Superb, and Highly Recommended for thriller lovers!",1342396800,2,554,5.607142857142857
