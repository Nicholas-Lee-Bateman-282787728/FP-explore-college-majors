8645415,5,B00ITQH6EU,"I fell in love with this series while I was stationed in England, got back to the states and the only place I could find it was on YouTube. The full episodes are hard to find now, and I wanted this epic series to share with my kids, so I bought it from England. The shipping was prompt, delivery on time, and half a world later, I'm sharing something amazing, original and supremely entertaining with my kiddos.",1454112000,,411,4.35064935064935
