7880293,2,6304984758,Good instruction but not for beginner.  Very disappointed. The hopping could have waited until the basics were mastered.,1517184000,,120,5.666666666666667
7880294,5,6304984758,"This Yoga station is a great one if you're beginner or not.  It tells you details for how you should be using and forming your body during every video, especially for new moves that you haven't done yet.  Definitely follow it episode by episode since there is definitely an order, especially if you are a beginner at yoga.  It's very intense and also relaxing, so you do work yourself, but in a way that is almost refreshing.  It's hard to explain.  But anyway, great videos, it actually is getting me into exercising at home, which is usually very difficult for me to do.",1511913600,,572,4.514563106796117

Unlike the 3 other different yoga tapes I have, there is immense variety with the wai lana tapes. The instruction is clear and detailed. Seeing what can be ultimately done with the 'asana' (pose) is nothing less than inspirational.  The scenery is breathtaking and the colorful every-changing costumes keeps visual oriented people like me from becoming bored.
I have an 'ashtanga' (power) yoga tape by another instructor and have Wai Lana's new 'fun challenge' tapes.  I needed to know ahead of time, what could be done with yoga, and what was the 'ultimate' in yoga. Because of the other yoga tapes I have, I thought I could work my way into her 'challenge' tapes.  NOT! I'm pleased to see that there really is a fitness level one must acquire.  So...I've placed the 'challenge' tapes on the shelf (temporarily) and on my goal list...and ordered these 'fitness' series tapes.  So much to strive for and learn.  oh boy!",1007337600,2,992,4.8
