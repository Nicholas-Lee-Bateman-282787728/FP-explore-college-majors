8360036,5,B002AQDDWO,"Some kids these days do better with an interactive movie than just a book.  That's why I bought this, and it's worked great!",1384819200,,124,4.391304347826087
8360037,4,B002AQDDWO,There are many educational videos for very young children but harder to find good ones once they reach six and seven years. Therefore to find Steps4Kids was a godsend. This particularly is an excellent video for six and older/younger children who are stubborn in bad writing habits and yet intelligent and eager to learn at the same time. A very landmark time in children's lives and this is a very landmark dvd. Would highly recommend Amazon for fast efficient delivery and my six year old says thank you to Steps4Kids.,1299801600,,520,4.788888888888889

The difference in my child's handwriting is unbelievable (and in a short period of time)! It was the perfect thing for my son on the spectrum and my neuro-typical kiddo! We are getting the cursive dvd next!!!",1276560000,,345,4.492063492063492
