5037492,5,B006YTL3W0,Thunderbean has done a remarkable job with this. We have not seen these cartoons like this since their theatrical release. The Technicolor is rich and saturated and these are miles away from the scratched and degraded prints used when these went to TV syndication. It's a shame that Paramount hasn't stepped up to restoring these cartoons. Thank you Thunderbean !!!!,1329523200,,366,5.116666666666666
5037493,5,B006YTL3W0,"Crank up the old Jack-in-the-box! Thunderbean's ""Noveltoons: Original Classics"" is here, and it's a gem of a collection.

It's pretty ironic that a cartoon studio bearing the moniker ""Famous"" produced so many shorts and characters that weren't. They were better known for Popeye, Superman and Casper the Ghost, but they also churned out a number of other creations like Herman the Mouse and Baby Huey, not to mention hordes of one-shot wonders.

Most of these miscellaneous shorts were released under the banner of the ""Noveltoons"" series. Famous Studios was formed in 1942 in the aftermath of some bitter business between Max and Dave Fleischer and distributor Paramount Pictures, so most of the staff from the original Fleischer studio remained. Many of them were master animators who had been in the game since the silent days, and it's interesting to see what they came up with when they weren't just making more Popeye or Superman shorts.

Not surprisingly, the animation in most of the Noveltoons is top notch, especially in the earlier entries. The art of Dave Tendlar, John Gentilella, Isadore Sparber, Seymour Kneitel, and Dan Gordon shines, as does that of Jim Tyer, one of the wackiest animators ever to pick up a pencil. It's nice to see these films with their original credits restored so that these artists can be appreciated by name.

Another aspect of the Noveltoons that really stands out is the voice acting. Sadly, it appears that Paramount, like many cartoon producers, had no interest in giving the actors credit. But they're good ones: Jackson Beck (who voiced Bluto in the Popeye shorts), Jack Mercer (Popeye), Sid Raymond, and Arnold Stang, among others. Composer Winston Sharples provides great musical scores as well.

As for the humor, well, after watching several Noveltoons in a row, it becomes clear why they aren't more popular. While the animation and artistry are on par with the best series from other studios at the time, the laughs aren't. The stories are mostly linear and straightforward, and the timing is often slow. The characters are memorable, but with many of them there's a feeling that we've seen them before. Blackie the Lamb could stand in for Bugs Bunny, Buzzy the Crow could be Woody Woodpecker, and Herman, for all his wiseguy charm, is really just another cartoon mouse in a sea of others. Even the overgrown lummox child concept had been done before Baby Huey showed up. (Junyer Bear, anyone?) At their best, though, these cartoons are still enjoyable, especially in the way the characters look and move. The cat and dog in ""Cheese Burglar"", the wolf in ""Teacher's Pest"", the horse in ""Ups an' Downs Derby"", and others just LOOK funny. It's also obvious when animator Jim Tyer is drawing them...they suddenly take on new levels of wackiness.

By the 1950's, the Famous cartoons got pretty formulaic and budget cuts put a damper on the creativity, but this DVD focuses on the 1942-1950 period, and there was some real experimentation going on here. There are rowdy cat-and-mouse chases clearly influenced by MGM, but there are also sweet, touching stories like ""The Enchanted Square"" featuring Raggedy Ann. There are chase cartoons, but there are also able attempts at Disney cuteness.

The real selling point of this DVD set, though, is the effort Steve Stanchfield and his team put into restoring these films. They're public domain, so they're easy to find...in fact they're a dime a dozen. Most of the copies out there, though, are shabby, faded and beat-up. They've changed hands so many times over the years that many have their titles and credits lopped off and replaced with a TV distributor's logo, are re-titled as ""Harveytoons"", and look like they were rescued from a local TV station's dumpster. (I suspect many of the prints used on the old public domain vhs collections were, in fact, acquired through Waste Management.) Stanchfield decided to go the extra mile and track down original theatrical prints with their original Paramount/Famous titles and credits, with unfaded color. If you've seen them before, you've never seen them like this! The colors pop, the lines are crystal clear, and the sound is excellent. These cartoons were made in Technicolor, and they USED it. At times it's dazzling, particularly the backgrounds. The skies in ""Lamb in a Jam"", the fantasy world in ""The Enchanted Square"", the backyard in ""Naughty But Mice"", and the house in ""Stupidstitious Cat"" will knock your socks off. Some shorts definitely look better than others, and you'll come across some dust, lines and the occasional film splice here and there...but it really gives you the feeling that you're watching these cartoons as they were seen back in the 1940's. Even the one or two lesser-quality prints on here look better than anything you'll find in the Wal Mart bargain bin.

It's also nice to see that Steve worked with the experts on this one. Jerry Beck, Thad Komorowski, Mike Kazaleh and Bob Jaques all give very informative commentaries. There's also bonus material including model sheets and drawings, plus a storyboard to finished cartoon comparison.

This DVD gave me a new appreciation for a series of cartoons I knew very little about, and introduced me to several great Golden Age films I'd just flat-out never seen. If not consistently funny or groundbreaking, they're beautiful to look at, and the animation is fantastic. Steve Stanchfield and Thunderbean Animation did this one right, and if you're an animation enthusiast, this belongs in your collection.",1329350400,59,5528,5.026200873362446
5037494,5,B006YTL3W0,"This was my first purchase from Thunderbean, but I was told what to expect... and that's what I got, a professionally produced and very well-made disc. The colors are vibrant and pop nicely. The sound is worthy of any Disney Treasures or Looney Tunes restoration; no popping, no hissing, very clean.

The transfers have do some dirt and imperfections, and a few color imperfections. But considering the age of the materials, this is natural and no different than you would find on the Disney collections. It should be noted that there are a few cringe-worthy and insensitive racial portrayals, but cartoons are a product of their time and that was part of the times back then. The five stars is despite that, and based on the quality of the materials and the top-notch presentation.",1329091200,2,782,4.835820895522388
5037495,5,B006YTL3W0,"As a fan of classic animation, I have always regarded the Noveltoons as a ""guilty pleasure."" Produced by Paramount's cartoon studio (post-Max Fleischer), these cartoons never had the prestige, class or wit of those from Disney, Warner Bros. or M-G-M. But they did find their own niche; they don't make cartoons like these any more. Included are a selection of 20 cartoons originally released between 1942 and 1950, featuring Herman the mouse, Baby Huey, Blackie the lamb, Spunky the donkey, Raggedy Ann and more. Some of these characters may seem familiar; many of the studio's post-1950 cartoons were later sold to Harvey Comics and became known as Harveytoons. The 1940s Noveltoons have never had an ""official"" DVD release, but several have appeared in random public domain collections of variable audio-visual quality; you may have seen several of these cartoons before, but here they look and sound better than ever, newly remastered from vintage 35mm and 16mm film materials. It's like seeing them again for the first time and is as close to ""restored"" as they're likely to get. As the back cover states, the characters ""pop right off the screen...with anvils and shotguns in hand!"" In fact, it's quite possible that Herman and Katnip may have inspired The Simpsons' Itchy & Scratchy; the violence is only a slight exaggeration. If you count yourself as a fan of vintage Hollywood cartoons from the golden age of animation, treat yourself to some pure, unadulterated, no-holds-barred fun the way it used to be. There are also some great extras, including vintage animation art, storyboards from the Baby Huey cartoon ""Quack-A Doodle Doo,"" and commentaries on selected cartoons by Jerry Beck and other animation historians. Highly recommended.

5037496,5,B006YTL3W0,"The previous reviews cover the cartoons well.

I agree that the restoration job is top-notch. I want to focus on the fascinating supplements. There is a gallery of promotional materials from the collection of Jerry Beck, a set of storyboards for the debut of Baby Huey, ""Quack a Doodle Doo"", which run alongside the final cartoon in synchronization, comics featuring the characters, and an audio commentary about the replacement of the original theatrical titles by those used for the TV re-releases, which plays over examples of the re-release titles. (The main shorts have restored theatrical titles.)

My favorite is an amazing set of production drawings (pencil with color guides) showing the drawings, in sequence, one drawing per screen, for the Jack-in-the-Box rising from his box and extending the ""Noveltoons"" sign, from the original titles. This is preservation of the history of animation at its best.",1329004800,5,912,5.2827586206896555
5037497,5,B006YTL3W0,"I received my copy of Thunderbean's Noveltoons DVD today, and couldn't wait to visit some old friends like Raggedy Ann and Baby (?) Huey. These people have done a remarkable job of restoring cartoons which, if they were available at all, were in very sad condition. I have never been a REAL fan of Paramount's cartoon output except for Popeye and Betty Boop, but these restorations really impressed me, and made me realize the cartoons were much better than my previously-held impressions. The animation is very good, and the soundtracks rich and full. As always, Winston Sharples' musical scores accentuate the action superbly. Thunderbean has done a marvelous job on previous restorations, but this may be their best effort. In addition to the cartoons, there are a number of special features including some episodes with commentary, storyboards, posters, etc. I love the original titles, and feel sure much work went into finding them. Again, this collection is outstanding, a must-have for any lover of classic animation. Kudos to Steve Stanchfield and his staff for a job extremely well done. Hoping for more of the same real soon.",1328918400,3,1136,5.080213903743315
5037498,5,B006YTL3W0,"It is great to see the Noveltoons get a great release, with somewhat never before seen material.  The cartoons are faithfully restored, as best as possible, with original and recreated Paramount titles on all of them.  On at least one of them, there is a very brief scene where a few frames are 16mm Eastmancolor splices, but nothing to complain about.  Hopes spring eternal that Viacom will appreciate the animation heritage of Paramount during the studio's 100th anniversary this year, by providing some official releases.

The bonus features are great as well.  Original artwork from the Noveltoons, as well as publicity materials, comic books, and even a section devoted to the TV titles are included.  Narration for some of the cartoons is provided by various animation historians.

If you have been wishing for an official release, this is the next best thing.",1328918400,5,866,5.056338028169014
5037499,5,B006YTL3W0,"Finally! After years of spending in the PD with terrible picture quality, Thunderbean now brings you it's very own release of Noveltoons!! In this release you'll find or rediscover the forgotten classics from Famous Studios (better known for Popeye after the Fleischer era) with characters  like Blackie the Sheep, Baby Huey, Herman the Mouse, Raggedy Ann, and Buzzy Crow. The cartoons on this set have been digitally restored and remastered from the best 16mm and 3mm IB Technicolor prints and they look so good, so colorful, your eyes will pop knowing you haven't seen Noveltoons or Famous Studio cartoons like this before! It's a must for Famous Studios/Noveltoons/Harveytoons fans!",1326931200,19,685,5.284403669724771

5037501,5,B006YTL3W0,"Beautiful color restorations,as viewed on my 60"" Plasma Home Theater. Very good Monophonic Sound Restoration. Easy to use menu. Get this before it disappears.",1365292800,,158,5.625
5037502,5,B006YTL3W0,"These Noveltoon classics are probably the best quality I ever saw them. I just hope they release another collection with more of these Noveltoons, like The Little School Mouse in Technicolor. Although some of these prints are the best, they are probably the best prints ever released in decades. They also have commentaries, and have Bonus features, such as Jerry Beck telling about the TV prints as they show them. I highly recommend this release for big Noveltoon fans!

**UPDATE**
This set was so good, Steve from Thunderbean confirmed this set sold out! No wonder, because this is one of the best sets of Thunderbean I've ever watched. It never gets old at all. Get this set now. Definitely worth the money you spend!",1357516800,,721,4.814516129032258

5037504,4,B006YTL3W0,"After the Fleischer brothers lost control of their animation studio it was a slow downhill slide for the renamed Famous Studios. Thunderbean presents a sampling of Famous' better efforts. As always, Thunderbean presents beautiful prints and a good selection. For a classic cartoon buff, even one such as I who have little love for Famous' output, this is well worth the money.",1352332800,10,376,5.080645161290323

5037506,4,B006YTL3W0,"I have to admit that after reading the reviews, I honestly was expecting a little more. That's not to say that this is a poor product, but some of the reviews here were so strong, that I think I came to expect perfection. Unfortunately, this falls a tad short of that. Still, though, this is a nice set that looks good. I'd possibly be interested in more Thunderbean stuff in the future, depending on what content is in there. (personally, I'd love to see a Screen Songs set... follow the bouncing ball, and sing along!)

Overall, I'd recommend it, but probably wouldnt' heap the same level of praise as other viewers.",1335484800,6,618,4.5675675675675675
5037507,2,B006YTL3W0,"It was a fun opportunity to go back in time, but I'm surprised at how violent this is!  I'm still looking for the cartoons that used to characterize famous people of the time and the ones that described dogs, such as, ""the pointer...."" and showed silly cartoons of the dogs - pointing like a human, for example!",1335052800,,311,4.456140350877193
5037508,5,B006YTL3W0,"I've been accumulating a decent amount of classic animation over the years.  In all of my searches, it all comes back to the same few that offer only the best.  One of these select few is Thunderbean.

I ordered this DVD on a Sunday and it arrived in PA (from MI I believe) the following Friday AM (the day I am writing this).  I've already watched it and it is everything I'd hoped it would be.  Steve & company don't just compile the best of what they find and offer it to the public - they painstakingly make it SO MUCH BETTER.

For those of you familiar with the Thunderbean Animation products - well, you're not reading this because you know what to expect.  For those of you unfamiliar - this is not a run-of-the-mill public domain collection.  This is a collection of hard to find masters beautifully restored to as close to the original productions as you will ever find them (perfect in my opinion).

Many of the shorts on Noveltoons Original Classics I've seen on different public domain discs or tapes and the quality of the prints used on those left much to be desired.  Not so with this release.  These shorts look better than I've ever seen them and they're all over 60 years old, with most from the 1940s.  They look great!

I don't usually talk much about the quality of a dvd, except for Cartoons as some need a re-mastered here and there, but this is one hell of an exceptional set of restored shorts. Just beautifully done.
It's a treasure to see such forgotten shorts being treat so wonderfully. Ignore any mindless chatter about violence and focus on the colours, the charming nature of the cartoons and the commentaries and extra's. They're all to die for.

The menu's are professional and easily navigated.

I'm gutted there was no small accompanying booklet like Snafu, Cubby bear etc, but that's my only fault (if you can call it as such)
