5119447,4,B008220CQU,"Who needs the walking dead, malevolent entities or gruesome, face eating aliens when you have South Central L.A.?

Here's the scoop. Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his partner Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) run a black and white in South Central L.A.. Brian is former military and recording video of their day to day on the job. He's obviously too smart for the job and will probably move up to detective. He has a great relationship with his partner Zavala. They can rib each other endlessly without taking offence. Most days are run of the mill, but they run into some situations that are awful and terrifying. What makes these situations so horror filled is that they are true to life. One thread begins to unravel a sweater too large for them to handle and it leads to a violent conclusion.

What little I read of the movie before going in did not prepare me for what I was about to see. I expected more of a traditionally filmed narrative with a well written script and an A to B to C plot-line. Nope. What I got was all hand-held camera with nearly no plot-line at all. This is a slice o' lifer through and through. You do not feel as though you are watching a film. It's more as though you're with them on their daily routine. There is an immediacy to it all. You are seeing what they are seeing when they see it and at times it's unsettling. There are a lot of crazy, mean, degenerates out there that are drug heads, gang-bangers, and people who deal in the worst of businesses. These cops come across them in their day to day and you wonder how they keep their heads on straight. You come to love and respect these two as the movie rolls on. There were some nice touches as well. When you meet Gyllenhaal's girlfriend/fiance (Anna Kendrick) she's a hoot.  She has a masters degree in fluid dynamics but she's not a stick in the mud. She gets down, and when the two of them perform their dance routine at their wedding, it's something to see.

I cannot say I'm the biggest fan of the police. I'm sure there is little doubt that some of the ills in society could not exist without their help. There are a lot of bad cops out there but here you get to see two guys who are just ""on the job"" and the stuff they have to put up with. I've gained a whole new respect for the good guys. There are some things that happen in the movie that run into the area of cliche, which is why I haven't given this the big 5 stars, but it has a tremendous amount of impact and will both frighten you and, at times, make your skin crawl. At a reported $7,000,000.00 budget the end far outweighs the dollars put in. If you're at all disposed to this kind of film, put this on your list. It's more than worth your time.",1350259200,6,2704,4.275390625
5119448,4,B008220CQU,"""End of Watch"" is a police crime drama from David Ayer who previous wrote movies like ""Fast and Furious"" and more similarly ""Training Day"". The real crime show feel of his ""Training Day"" and ""End of Watch"" movies seem to be his niche because he's real good at it. With his police crime drama's, you don't get the typical Hollywood police movie, you get something that borders on real. You truly feel like you are on the beat in the middle of some of the worst Los Angeles neighborhood's possible.

""End of Watch"" introduces us to Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) as they ride in their police cruiser. We see their world from a dash camera and a camera that Taylor carries with him to document his world, or basically to screw around with. I'm not a big fan of shaky-cam movies, but in this situation, it works because it lends to the effect of realism and adds to the tension you feel as they confront their work. Not to mention, the shaky cam isn't all the time, just when needed or it adds to the events.

""End of Watch"" is a buddy movie that could be deemed a comedy if you wanted to, although truthfully, it is just real. As the officers ride around we experience real life. We experience what officers who spend day in and day out in a car together talk about. We get to know them this way. We get to know their intelligence, their home lives, their sense of humor and the conversations are frank and honest, just like the violence and the action throughout the film.

As we watch Taylor and Zavala's bravery and learn who they are and who they have waiting for them at the end of their days, the events of the film become even more tense. Through a random course of events, they eventually pull the waging tail of a dangerous Mexican drug cartel that has leaked it's way into Southern California. It is at this point that Taylor and Zavala's lives change dramatically and it is the blood and bones of the movie.

""End of Watch"" is a new kind of buddy movie and in it, you discover the love and bond that officers in the field have and form for each other. Dealing with extremely dangerous situations is just another day on the job. ""End of Watch"" is a great film, as was ""Training Day"". Both movies showed a grit and realism that took it above the typical buddy cop, crime movie. There's no faking the bond these two officers feel for each other. The creator's flesh out every corner of the lives these guys lead right in front of your eyes with skillful camera use and skillful story telling.",1349913600,,2528,4.406852248394005
5119449,4,B008220CQU,"Everyone seems to want to be a Youtube one-hit wonder nowadays, something that ""End of Watch"" laughs at relentlessly.  We see the joke right away, but soon we think the joke's on us; because the cinematography is a blend of video footage and camera close-ups ""End of Watch"" is a dizzying ride.  It's such a fast and furious ride that it doesn't occur to us that there's no plot and it feels like a lot longer ride than it actually is.  The minimalist plot is also formulaic and entirely predictable.

But I still highly recommend this film.  It's a film by the director of ""Training Day,"" which I liked very much for its attitude and its grit.  ""End of Watch"" is ""Training Day"" on steroids.",1349136000,,690,4.48
5119450,4,B008220CQU,"If  you ever wanted to know what it was like to be a beat cop in L. A. without the danger, this David Ayer film may be as close as you'll get.  Shot in the overused ""found footage"" style, we get a tension filled action drama with excellent character development and sense of realism.  Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena give memorable performances as partners who are also best friends and confidants, each inviting the other into their extended families.

Officers Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Pena) are hot shot cops who want to do more than make traffic arrests while patrolling a mixed gang section of L. A.  Sometimes heroic (rescuing children from a burning house or from an abusive home) and sometimes foolish (not waiting for backup) they manage to stumble upon an arm of a Mexican cartel involved in human trafficking.  Taylor is filming everything as a project for a class he is taking at a local college.  In addition to using a small traditional HD camera, he attaches mini cameras to himself and his partner.  The squad car is also enhanced with an inward focused camera in addition to the normal outbound dash-cam.

This works most of the time.  The trick works best when it captures the two cops in their car talking to each other.  We get a real sense of their camaraderie and brotherly love for each other.  It also works well when they enter homes and buildings.  When we only get to see what they are seeing, there is a true sense of dread and concern.  The effect doesn't always work however.  Doesn't it seem a bit unusual to see a co-ed cluster of gang-bangers also shooting footage?  For what, their trial?  In the most flagrant use of the home video, who is taking those midrange shots of the cops while they chit chat in a convenience store?  ""End of Watch"" is a solid, exciting, gut wrenching cop drama and is certainly worth seeing although you may feel a bit dizzy when it's all over.",1348704000,36,1913,4.576470588235294
5119451,5,B008220CQU,"This intriguing story takes place in the rough-tough streets of L.A., which isn't much different than the streets of New York City. This police drama is about the lives of two young police officers, on-and-off the streets of danger and crime. We follow Brian and Mike as the calls come in to the scenes of different situations. We are introduced to the risk good-clean police-officers must face on an everyday basis, the close encounters to putting their lives on the line, and how easy it is for them to become a victim. The viewer follows the calls to constant danger, regardless of the reason. It could be drugs, or any number of violent-evil scenes in which the two officers must also protect each other. The theme is the value of friendship, a bond between the officer and his partner, and the inside scenes of what type of life they live and how it could affect personal lives. The acting is Excellent, the drama is intriguing, special effects are good, and the story grabs your attention. I didn't expect such good results, but it was very Entertaining and Enjoyable. Highly Recommended to mystery and thriller lovers, who are interested in drama with explosive action!",1348617600,3,1176,4.798029556650246
5119452,4,B008220CQU,"Directed by David Ayer, ""End of Watch"" is a police drama that celebrates the value of friendship and the all too frequently unsung efforts of police officers to try to keep the rest of us free from the violence and evil the officers constantly endure.  The movie is set on a rough police beat in South Central Los Angeles and follows the activities of two young officers, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhall) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) as they cruise the streets and fight crime. Some scenes of the movie take place in the police academy or the stationhouse and show the cameraderie among the men and the women in uniform.

The movie is a mix of introspection and action. Brian and Mike depend upon each other for their lives, and they are fast friends. As they drive the streets they discuss their families, their respective ethnicities and backgrounds, their dreams and their women. Mike has been married to his high school sweetheart for eight years, while Brian has found a new romantic interest that develops in the course of the movie.  The two men are close in a macho sort of way.

When not in their car, the movie depicts the life of violence and risk in the day-to-day world of the police in a crime-ridden area.  The movie shows a variety of calls, some serious some not, as Brian and Mike look for missing kids, investigate drugs in a sleazy bar, engage in fisticuffs with a small-time crook, rescue small children from a burning home, and much more. Not all the the situations are made clear.  As the movie develops, the action revolves around a large Mexican drug cartel that has its grip on the South Central LA Beat. Brian and Mike are drawn progressively deeper into investigating this cartel with scenes of human trafficking, among other things, leading to a escalating violent close.

The movie captures grungy streets, shabby businesses, and derelict homes as well as a life of constant danger for the officers. One of the officers shoots videos of the passing scenery from the patrol car, giving much of the film a wavery feel to match the actions on the dangerous streets. The musical score of the film is loud, tension building, and pulsating.

The dialogue, from both the police and the criminals, is raw and fully profane. The police in this movie are honest, dedicated to their calling, and willing to assume the frightening risks they take every day. They are tough individuals, both the men and the women, and not saints. Particularly as the violent cartel figures come to prominence towards the end, the movie is effective as an action drama. The stronger theme of the movie, however, lies in its development of the friendship between the two major characters. During a time when the services and characters of the police are not always honored, this movie offers a portrayal of the grittily heroic qualities of the police and their work.

5119453,4,B008220CQU,"I saw the trailer on several occasions in recent weeks when going to other movies in the theatre and I really liked what I saw  and couldn't wait to see this movie. I would not be disappointed.

""End of Watch"" (2012 release; 108 min.) brings the story of two LAPD officers, Taylor (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (played by Michael Pena), as they go about their daily beats in LA's Southland. Sometimes the tasks are tedious,  other times the tasks are gruesome and/or scary. Unbeknownst to Taylor and Zavala, they are stumbling into the workings of a Mexican drug cartel, thereby becoming the hunted themselves. To give away more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, be aware that the movie is mostly shot in the style of  the TV shows ""Cops"", so if you have a hard time viewing hand-held camera photography, you'll probably want to sit this one out. Second, it appears that writer/director David ""Training Day"" Ayer is completely at home in the world of cop dramas; the movie feels as authentic as you've ever seen a cop movie, and in that vein it feels similar to ""training Day"". Third, this is as much a ""buddy"" movie than it is a cop drama, and the interaction between Gyllenhaal and Pena really carries the movie. Last, not surprisingly, the acting is mostly superb; besides the lead actors, check out also Anna ""Up In the Air"" Kendrick in a small but noticeable role as Taylor's girlfriend/eventual wife. Bottom line: this is one tough, gritty cop drama. Not for the faint of heart, but otherwise highly recommended!",1348444800,,1621,4.713780918727915
5119454,4,B008220CQU,gritty little tale of 2 cops in a car. The actors do a great job The story is ok. Enough reality to get by some tear inducing melodrama.,1348358400,,136,3.892857142857143
5119455,3,B008220CQU,"It seems like David Ayer has been making the same film over and over again since ""Training Day,"" doesn't it? While he didn't direct ""Training Day,"" every film he's directed since then has revolved around South Central and/or the LAPD. The intriguing aspect though is that Ayer tweaks a few things here and there to make whatever is his most recent film a bit stronger and a bit better than his previous works despite being similar in story and execution. ""End of Watch"" is certainly his strongest effort, but comes up short when it tries to jump into superb territory.

Two LAPD police officers, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena), are partners and best friends. They're put on the fast track to success after they handle a car chase that ends in shots being fired completely by the book. Despite their constant joking and the way they kind of strut around the precinct, their job is extremely dangerous and everyone around them does their best to remind them of that. A routine stakeout turns out to be so much more when they find a pot of soup filled with stacks of cash along with a bejewelled pistol and a golden AK-47. The Mexican cartel are in Los Angeles and Brian and Mike have to watch where they step before they bite off more than they can chew.

""End of Watch"" is filmed almost entirely in that handheld and almost documentary type of camera perspective. Gyllenhaal and Pena wear cameras on their pockets the entire time while Gyllenhaal carries around a camera. It isn't quite as shaky or as bad as you may think, but it's basically a slightly more HD step above what you'd see on ""Cops."" Considering the content of the film, it actually feels like it's throwing you right into the action which is more than likely the intent of the style. But it may still give you motion sickness if you've had issues with it in the past.

The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena carries the film; their constant ribbing of one another and the way they confide in one another really makes it seem like their bond runs deep. Their friendship is built to pull you in for something that happens later on and even though you sense that coming a mile away the event still hits you like a bag of bricks when it finally does happen.

It almost seems like ""End of Watch"" starts off very lighthearted and slowly snowballs into something darker and grittier before completely pulling the rug out from underneath you in its final moments. It begins with Brian and Mike constantly joking around and each call they have gets more and more serious. They're dealing with gang wars, but they spend their down time discussing the type of women they want to be with or telling ridiculous stories. Then they get the call to find the missing children, follow the lead on the guy that pulls a gun out on Mike after they pull him over, offer assistance to Van Hauser (David Harbour) and his partner, and eventually get baited into following that van that runs a red light. It's a shame we didn't get to see more of the shotgun cam perspective as it's incredibly effective and pretty awesome.

""End of Watch"" contains a lot more moments that take your breath away or attempt to shock you than Ayer's other works. The scene with the house that's on fire is incredibly difficult to watch as is the Van Hauser rescue and the minivan tail. The film seems to chicken out at the end though. It has you in the palm of its hand and is all set to end on a really disheartening note, but then backtracks and has you laughing as you exit the theater. It makes sense as most people want to leave a film on a high note, but speaking as someone who thrives on edgier filmmaking and depressing conclusions the action drama kind of loses its nerve at the last minute and goes with something light and fluffy instead of something heavy and contemplative.

""End of Watch"" pushes boundaries, is extremely gritty, and has this sense of realism that isn't usually found in films like this. The chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena is also incredibly strong, but the film almost seems to lose its testicles in its closing moments. It spends all this time showing you edgy content and pushing you towards the edge of your seat and then just kind of delivers this lukewarm conclusion even though it had all of the elements of leaving you with something great. Something that may get overlooked that you should keep an eye out for is Frank Grillo's performance. He has so little screen time, but has one scene with a huge amount of emotional impact.

""End of Watch"" is an impressive action drama and easily David Ayer's most impressive film to date, but just loses its momentum in its final act to keep it from being really, really good.",1348272000,5,4730,4.570754716981132
5119456,5,B008220CQU,"First of all, let me say that I am not a professional movie critic. So, I am just going to evaluate the movie based on my personal experience and enjoyability of the film. This film was phenomenal. It was very well directed. The plot was very credible and for those working on law enforcement, it will seem too accurate. The actors nailed it. It was also filmed like ""Cloverfield"", to make you believe that you are part of the action as a first person viewer. That was my only complaint. Since, this type of filming seems to give me headaches.  Overall, I would give this film 5 stars based on the following: enjoyability, credibility, acting, costumes/clothing, special effects and plot delivery/transition and conclusion. This is not your typical ""happy ending"" cop movie. So, if you want a happy ending fake cop movie, do not bother watching this one. Great movie, overall.

They put up with a lot of crap from the public, there are plenty of big-headed egos, and tons of grit and toughness.  At the same time this movie shows that these officers are also human -- dealing with life's typical struggles like relationship issues, family health, and financial struggles, all while watching drug dealers and street gangs/thugs get flush with cash as they grow their wealth illegally.  There are several scenes where you know one of these guys needs to cross the line by pocketing a few hundred or thousand bucks that no one will miss.  There's also some great interplay between Michael Pena and Jake G.

There is plenty of foul language, gun fights, blood, death, etc. so its not a good movie for kids, but young adults and older will do just fine unless they cannot deal with those issues.",1508025600,,1010,4.7701149425287355
5119611,2,B008220CQU,"I wanted to see this film for a long time.  Having watched it tonight, I am incredibly disappointed.  First, if you have vertigo, or any kind of seizure disorder, don't watch this film.  Gyllenhaal's character is filming their life as cops as a film project, and the camera work is all over the map.  Up, down, in, out, from his belt buckle up to his face  --  it's incredibly distracting, and completely unnecessary.

As for the story underneath the horrid camera work is below average.  We've all seen buddy cop films, and this one is not a standout.  The men were not interesting, and the dialogue between them was ""bro, dude,"" etc,. and the subject matter was women, marriage, sex, police work.  Absolutely nothing of substance.

As for what they ""stumbled onto,"" as they tell you in the description, is nothing more than you'd see in 100 episodes of Law & Order: SVU, but for these guys, for some reason, the bad guys wanted them.  I will say no more than that, but to me it made no real sense.

The patrolling part of the work, and the people they encountered was interesting, and the performances were good.  Unfortunately, they were two characters I didn't care much about.  They were pretty juvenile, and one-dimensional.

Save your time and money and watch Training Day or something.",1507766400,,1293,4.68

5119641,3,B008220CQU,"What started out as a great drama turned into a farce. The first half to a third of this movie was stellar. Great writing, great scripting and a great concept. The chemistry these two actors had with one another was incredible! This was an atypical ""buddy cop"" movie. Nevertheless it did have its flaws--some minor and some serious.

No cop would ever put his gun belt down to fight a perp. An LAPD cop as we've seen from the perfidy of Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind, Stacey Coon and Theodore Briseno will bash someone's brain in and/or shoot someone (Armed Or Unarmed) and ask questions later. That was a minor flaw. Another flaw comes when one cop says to another--""you're not a detective."" But the cop continues on a hunch without reporting to his supervisors. This would have garnered them a serious reprimand if not a suspension.

The most ludicrous thing in the movie was four gang members having the cops in their sights from an elevated vantage point and opening up with four or five AK-47's and MISSING IN FULL AUTOMATIC! NO WAY! The credibility of the movie went out the window with that. There's a reason why Dr. Harry Turtledove chose the AK-47 as his rifle of choice for the Confederate Army in his fictitious Guns of the South book. The weapon is the single best rifle ever to be created! It is accurate and in full automatic can cut down scores of charging men. Those cops would have been swish cheese cops and anyone with military training can verify that fact. It's accurate even in select fire. See the scene from the movie Boyz N the Hood to see the accuracy of this weapon as it cuts down four (Not Two) men running away.

I bought this DVD back in 2015 and I give it Three Stars even. I'm the 1835th person to review this film. Buy the film and you may or may not be disappointed.",1504569600,,1801,4.468085106382978

But the way they acted seemed realistic all except the radio usage. They rolled up on officers down several times and had shots fired but never did they say either over the radio which I've never seen in any situation from any cop related videos.

Video style was unique because it made the movie seem real. The end was legitimately gut wrenching.

I liked nearly every part of the movie and I am the kind of person to break down any movie for every inaccuracy so that should say something. Again the only thing I can complain about is the radio protocols but they are in California so it may just be different.",1498176000,2,756,4.316901408450704

5120001,4,B008220CQU,"Cinematography: Was not what I was expecting. Upon reading the synopses on IMDB, saying that the film was shot in a documentary style, I was expecting a ""found footage"" film. Something that was going to be very shaky and annoying. Rather, I was pleasantly surprised. Although there were shots in the film that were very shaky and they were not annoying. It was mostly because it felt like I was actually watching something that could have been filmed with a handheld camcorder; with film grain, soft focus, and the occasional shake from walking or driving, all in all, it was well done.

Audio: Just as with the visuals, the audio would change according to the scene/shot to make it really feel as if it was coming through a camcorder. There wasn't a point in time during the film that I could remember where the audio didn't sound good. It wasn't absolutely perfect, but it was done very well.

Music: From was I can remember, the music fit the film but it wasn't memorable. I can't say all the much about the music since I cannot really remember it.

Editing: I loved the editing. The less you notice the editing, the better the editor did his/her job. Which I why I tend to pay close attention to the editing. This film was cut very smoothly. Each shot was held for the perfect about of time. I saw no jarring cuts. There were some jump cuts, but they were used quite well. In fact, the film was edited so nicely that from time to time, I didn't notice the cuts. Although the editing of the film was no Memento, it was still beautifully pieced together.

Story/plot: I felt that there was no real plot. It basically was just the lives of two cops and the stuff they dealt with. Other then that, there wasn't much too it. When they brought back a character that was established early on in the film, I wasn't really expecting it as I didn't believe that there was much significance to that character. Basically, I wasn't the biggest fan of the concept. But the execution was well done.",1480032000,4,1987,4.49584487534626

Police work comes with natural real life drama and action, in this instance the script really does write itself, so I was okay with it being used for a film like this. I just wish it had been done more naturally. I understand that the film takes place in a gang infested area of L.A. and that they needed to make it more dramatic and action packed for it to succeed in theaters, but you talk about going over the top. That's where Director, David Ayer comes in, after all gangs and going over the top are his specialty. End of Watch does have some great chase scenes and some really cool moments between partners, but for the most part it's just one non-stop explosion filled gun battle after another, making Los Angeles look like Fallujah. The point of view cameras do give us an interesting look at the action and some new perspective into how it's all made, which I thought was really cool, but I mean the lack of story line and constant shooting was beyond ridiculous. I'm some what surprised they'd didn't just go full on crazy and release the whole thing in 3-D.",1467244800,,1265,4.364406779661017

5120902,3,B008220CQU,"3 1/2 stars -- There's nothing at all wrong with the performances here -- Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are two cops who together patrol a very rough section of Los Angeles, Anna Kendrick and Natalie Martinez play their respective wives. It's a conceit of the movie that Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal) is filming as much as he can of his life as a cop, although his precinct captain isn't ecstatic about that.  But even when he isn't deliberately filming, there are body cams, surveillance cams (for some very nasty bad guys), and car-interior dash cams -- and all of the video thus generated ostensibly makes up what we see of their lives on the screen.  The idea is to seem to show us, the viewer, an unfiltered view of the cops' lives, so the angles are odd, the visual quality is grainy at times, and the pace is hectic.  Of course, the impression that this is all unfiltered is an illusion -- the director, David Ayer, has cut and shaped this pseudo-documentary material for his purposes, and these purpose seem to be to create a sense of tension and breathlessness as the cops go about their business.  Such editing creates a sense of imminent threat in many situations (the kinds of cameras ostensibly used here can see only so much, after all), and as we watch we are certainly caught up in the action in a way that we wouldn't be with more conventional pacing and filming.  In a way, then, the movie is a triumph of style -- call it pseudo-documentary style -- and that style works to a certain extent.

There are limits, though.  The characters and the plot and the situations are standard-issue crime drama: it's just the look that's different.  The cops are sympathetic characters: courageous, honest, protective of one another, tough, sensitive.  Their lives haven't hardened them, and as family men, they are exemplary.  In a more conventionally-paced story, they might strike us as sentimentally idealized, but such is the pace here, that that doesn't strike us until later, when we're thinking over what we've seen.  Without giving away too much of the plot, I can say that, in the course of doing their job, they run up against the Sinaloa drug cartel, that also seems to run a human trafficking operation.  They soon learn that Federal officials have that group under surveillance, and that leads to some awkward moments -- the Feds want to make their moves in their own time, and Taylor and Zavala (Pena) feel compelled to take action when they feel people's lives are in danger, no matter what the Fed agenda is.  Their interference, of course, is something that the cartel becomes aware of, and there's a set-up for a final confrontation.  All of these kinds of plot complications are what I mean by ""standard-issue crime drama,"" but credit where credit is due -- we see them through new eyes, as it were.

At bottom, though, it's a buddy-movie.  Both the cops are very likeable, and for all the profane chatter of the dialogue, the movie is sentimental.  If we grant Ayer his visual and editing choice and are thus susceptible to their expressive effects, you have to admit that the movie is well put-together.  Ayer's only serious misjudgement, I think, is the final scene -- a conversation in the police car.  Even so, I can imagine some viewers thinking that it works.",1457481600,,3291,4.712041884816754

If you can get past the ""F"" word spoken a million times, this is a REAL GRITTY movie. Not for the weak hearted.

Very well done as law enforcement movies go, and also I would think entertaining in a sense for most of the public and/also provides some insight into some of the insanity that law enforcement faces on the streets in crime ridden areas in particular large metro areas. I would advise law enforcement officers thinking about watching this movie. to perhaps consider that for a while,..  because of the nature of some parts of the story, just an advisory via that.

I recently did the Amazon Instant video to see it again. The pairing of Michael Pena and Jake Gyllenhaal makes this a great film. They have a great chemistry together and also with the other characters like the cop played by America Ferrara.

It gives you a new respect for what the police, especially the LAPD, are out there doing every day in some of the worst neighborhoods, especially South Central. I had no idea because you don't really hear about this on the news, or if you do, it's just about an isolated incident. It's presented like a documentary because Jake Gyllenhaal's character is actually filming for a college class he's taking in his pre-law program.

Very well done film and a story nobody has done before, at least not like this. I highly recommend it.",1437350400,4,950,4.549707602339181

5121694,5,B008220CQU,"This LA cop film is unusual in several ways. First of all: the cops are the good guys. Then: most of the action is filmed by hand held cameras, which I don't normally like much, but which works very well here. Then: Jake G's lead character is filming much of it, and commenting it, almost like reality TV. This takes us into the events more effectively than I would have expected.
The story: two uniformed cops in their car, bantering and joking when nothing goes on, good friends in private life, much challenged by darkness when calls come. They are an effective and honest team and they believe in their mission. They attract the wrath of a particularly vicious bunch of gangsters, which leads into bloody murder. Profanity levels are substantial and impressive. Soon experts will be able to use nothing but the f-word and will still be understood... After all, life is simple and the f-word says it all.

Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) are two L.A. police officers and long-time friends who go all Riggs and Murtaugh on a Mexican drug cartel and end up with a price on their heads.

What did I think?

Look, I guess this movie has its positives, especially if you're already a fan of cop films. But their big thing at the start is how this is all footage shot by the cops themselves, and then its like the director just straight-up forgot thats what they were doing, or maybe he just thought it was too hard to maintain. Handheld/""found"" footage is a slippery beast at the best of times, but establishing it as the crux of your storytelling method then just periodically abandoning it seems kind of insane, really.",1431993600,,757,4.592592592592593

Sound levels were inconsistent, and I found myself almost constantly adjusting the volume of my sound system up during quiet segments, then back down when the music soundtrack kicked in.

This movie is pretty accurate in its depiction of the worst parts of LA and the very real danger the police are in every single day.  I was a cop for a short time in a quiet little town whose idea of a busy night was seizing a keg at a high school party, its almost a diffrent world.
This is very entertaining, and dramatic and will rip out your heart and leave it on your lap. If u don't choke up you aren't human. If you liked Training Day with Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington I would think that this would be right up your alley.  Michael Pena is wonderful his charisma and sense of humor really shine through this flick.

5122303,5,B008220CQU,"I was very favourably surprised and even more, IMPRESSED, by this 2012 thriller drama. It is definitely one of the best crime films I saw in those last years. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The film tells the story of two veteran LAPD officers, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Miguel Zavala (Michael Pena). They are simple uniformed street patrol officers, albeit Taylor, a former Marine, wants to make detective and studies in the evenings. As part of his studies he records a lot of what happens on their patrols. This film is composed integrally with recordings, mostly those made by Taylor, but also a couple of news reportings, some official ceremonial recordings and also some footage of conversations of street gangsters, moslty made with their cell phones.

I will not say much about the story because it contains twists, surprises and developments which should be discovered integrally by the viewers. I would really advise AGAINST researching this film on internet before viewing, because here any kind of spoilers damage the viewing experience quite seriously. Suffice it to say that Taylor and Zavala are tough (and extremely potty mouthed) but honest and quite likeable police officers, who patrol a particularly rotten, dangerous part of Los Angeles.

Well known by local street gangs for being courageous, tough (and dangeorus if needs be) but fair and honest, they are treated with a (very) reluctant respect by some of gangbangers - but also supremely hated by many others. Amongst the latter the most prominent is Big Evil (Maurice Compte), a (not very sane) leader of a paricularly vicious Latino outfit, the Curbside Gang.

With time we also come to know Miguel's wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez) and Taylor's most recent girlfriend (Anna Kendrick), as well as some other police officers and brass both men are working with.

Before ""End of watch"" David Ayers made two other ""cops+gangsters in LA"" films, ""Harsh Times"" in 2006 with Christian Bale and ""Street Kings"" in 2008 with Keeanu Reeves. The first one was bad and the second one hardly better - in fact I forgot what they were about almost immediately after watching them. But this film, well, this is a whole different enchilada!

""End of watch"" is a very good film, both in its technical visual aspect and in its scenario, which is an exceptionally solid thing. Most of this film is dialogs and they are actually very good - even if the amount of OBSCENITIES is such that some DVD players will probably not resist it...))) We are frequently surprised and shocked, but those surprises and shocks actually make sense and the whole story flows very logically and harmoniously until the end. It is a thing rare enough in recent films to deserve particular praise.

The treasures in this film are many and you deserve to discover them by yourself, but I simply must state here, that whoever invented the character of La La (Yakira Flakiss Garcia) should get an Oscar. The very idea of naming the very lesbian and absolutely TERRIFYING top killer of Curbside Gang after one of Teletubbies, well, I bow very low to whomever thought about it...)))

As written in the title of this review, for my personal taste, if ""The Shield"" was a movie instead of TV show and about good cops, instead of rotten evil ones, well, it would be this film... And for me it is the SUPREME praise, as I simply ADORED ""The Shield"".

I was very impressed by this film and I will keep the DVD for another viewing in the future. A film to see absolutely! ENJOY!",1415664000,,3535,4.839403973509934

5122314,4,B008220CQU,"The two leads are terrific in a tale that makes patrolling in South Central look only slightly less dangerous than the streets of Fallujah in 2005.  Gyllenhaal and Pena have an easy rapport in their scenes in their black-and-white that's a mark of good acting and direction.  Without giving anything away, the next to last scene is cribbed from LA Confidential.  There's also a scene, which I'm surprised critics did not remark upon when the film was released, that makes the viewer question the ethics of using very small children in violent films.

Yes, the whole handheld video clich is a bit played out and certainly detracts from the overall quality of this flick. Also, about 60 to 70% of this movie is nothing more than characters having boring, meaningless, banal conversations. However, the action scenes make up for the film's downfalls in spades.

5122358,1,B008220CQU,"i usually enjoy cop drama's, S.W.A.T., Bad Boys II, and the latter. But End of Watch just sucked..

My first complaint with the movie, is the overuse of the F bomb. I'm a grown adult male, who can handle and usually not even notice the F word in a movie that is well written, Ex. Reservoir Dogs. But this movie's language borders gets repetetive, and annoying with how much swearing there is.. They CONSTANTLY use the F word to show the writers stupidity and lack of adjectives. It makes watching the movie again a chore..

My second complaint, is there is just too much character development. They show officer Brian Taylor and his new girlfriend dancing, singing, drinking, making out, gossiping, and more. I understand they wanted to make the ending more impacting for the audience that way.. But it goes overboard and feels like filler..

Overall, i'd say pass this. If your curious, Pirate it, but don't pay a cent to see this trash.

5122511,5,B008220CQU,"Warning: There is strong language used throughout, drug use and gruesome/ violent scenes. There's also racist jokes told between the officers jabbing at each other but I didn't find anything offensive and only humorous.

End of Watch is about two young Los Angeles police officers who stumble upon secrets of the Mexican drug cartel which leads them to become the cartel's targets. The leading roles are Officer Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Officer Mike Zavala (Michael Pena), who are partners in the LAPD. The villains of the movie come off as very evil, hateful people. One is even named 'Big Evil' because, well, as he put it, ""my evil is big.""

Although this film is directed by the same man who did 'Training Day', it is nothing like that movie. This film led by Gyllenhaal and Pena shows qualities, between the two, that every officer should have; those being courage, loyalty, and integrity. There is no dirtiness or crookedness about them like with Denzel Washington in 'Training Day'. They are honorable and dedicated to their job and loyal to one another, you can feel the sense of brotherhood between them. I felt like both actors did exceptionally well and gave a realistic/ natural performance. Prior to seeing this I wasn't a Jake Gyllenhaal fan but he won me over in this performance.

Throughout the movie you'll see them at the barracks, on the job, and off duty within their personal lives in an attempt to make you feel connected with them on a personal level. The majority of the film is shot from a first person perspective which allows you to see things not only from Officer Zavala and Taylor's POV but also the gang members POV. Different ways the film is recorded include cameras attached to each officer's shirt, handheld camcorders, a dash cam etc. I found it interesting but some people will not like this filming style at all.

I'll be completely honest this movie is a tear jerker and it's also one of my all time favorite movies. If you can handle the filming style; you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll love End of Watch.",1401494400,4,2058,4.740223463687151

This found footage style film feels it at the beginning but manages to keep a strong forward stream narrative though toward the end of the film it stops feeling like a found footage film.  The film follows officers Taylor and Zavala, beat cops, who are punching their way through the drug dealers and dirtbags in South Central L.A. when they make a huge drug bust that is being supported by Mexican cartels who put out a hit on the two maverick officers.  What follows is their passing through a gauntlet of bullets and blood that doesn't end well.

5122612,4,B008220CQU,"Watching ""End of Watch,"" with the humorous banter between LAPD officers Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Miguel Zavala (Michael Pena) cruising along in their patrol car and responding to dispatch calls on their radio, reminded me of watching episodes of Jack Webb's ""Adam-12"" TV series with my mother when I was a kid, only full of F-bombs. If any entertainment since ""Adam-12"" has portrayed the LAPD in such a favorable light as ""End of Watch,"" I'm not aware of it. The film was made with LAPD's full support.

Like on ""Adam-12,"" some of the calls Taylor and Zavala respond to are goofy and some are serious. These tough, courageous men enthusiastically embrace the often difficult, dangerous work of fighting crime and savings lives, while revealing deep bonds with each other and their civilian families. It's fascinating to see their approaches to different situations. We realize that modern police work requires not just courage and strength, but a vast range of interpersonal and law enforcement skills, social work, and judgment.

However, before we are through, ""End of Watch"" has descended far below the sunny surface of ""Adam-12."" Taylor and Zavala work South Central LA, where poverty, drugs and vicious gangs have shredded the social fabric. They inadvertently stumble into a rat's nest of human and drug trafficking that's carried out by a Mexican drug cartel and under investigation by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement.agents. It's gruesome, nasty descent into a crime hell that's not for those with weak stomachs.

""End of Watch"" is shot mostly with hand-held cameras, which gives the viewer an ""in the action"" feel but may bother some people. I watched it on my computer screen so it did not annoy me too much, but had I seen it in a theater, I probably would have felt wobbly. The acting by the two leads is very good. The script carries you effectively into the workaday world of cops on a tough beat. But while you get to know and like Taylor and Zavala, this is accomplished in kind of a lazy way--they're honorable guys who love their families and friends and are fighting the good fight. It might have been more interesting if they had been subject to some moral ambiguity. The other problem with the script for me was the incessant F-bombs. I really don't object to ""bad language"" in movies if it fits the characters and situations (Joe Pesci in ""Goodfellas""? No problem), but if you put an F-bomb in almost every sentence, and sometimes more than one per sentence, it starts to feel like monotonous, lazy writing. I heard that writer-director David Ayer finished the script in six days. A little rewriting might have been a good thing.

I did not love ""End of Watch,"" but I liked it and appreciated the insight into the daily grind of police work it afforded.",1389657600,,2797,4.8574423480083855
5122613,2,B008220CQU,"This movie seemed like it would be interesting when it came out, I thought the story would be more interesting and possibly more action, instead its more of a cop buddy drama with some comedy thrown in.  The basic plot is Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are patrol cops worki
ng the east L.A. area, responding to dangerous situations and forming a bond in the process.

End of Watch comes at a time when we the audience have already seen many, many movies with similar themes.  I suppose that when the producers were making this movie, they thought, we'll make a cop film that doesn't have corruption and just shows them trying to do job.  While I get the concept, the movie consistently felt lacking.  Where I thought there would be suspense and action, instead there's routine scenes of them following/interacting with dangerous gang members, as part of an investigation THEY AREN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IN THE FIRST PLACE.  They are not corrupt, but they definitely overstep their boundaries.

The details of the criminals they're after aren't important, but there's a murder in the movie, both characters find the body report it, but take it further.  They decide to investigate themselves and go find the killers, something left to detectives.  There's one scene where they are hanging out at the house the person was killed it and a superior more or less warns both of them to stay away and don't take it further; of course they are good to not abuse their power and track down the killer themselves.

I could only wonder what actual police officers think of this movie.  There's probably some movies that they think are absolutely ridiculous in their premise or the character's actions, but this movie probably has to be one of the of the worst offenders.  Early on Gyllenhall's character carries around a digital video camera around with him, filming other officers and the crime scenes they arrive on; everyone is annoyed with it, but he more or less carries on with this behavior.  I don't believe there's any universe where this scenario would take place.  Gyllenhall plays a wise-ass eager young cop, somebody who is loyal to force, but questions it in a way a slacker-civilian would.  Again, watch the movie and you'll agree with me that the other cops would have beat the s*** out of him for most of his antics on the film.

Michael Pena's character is more of the 'straight' man to Gyllenhall's comic-relief.  Again though, you think that there will be something different or unique to these characters or story, but not really, they're relationship is copied from Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon.  The conversations in the car boil down due their differences in marriage and relationships.  Michael Pena's character is married, Gyllenhall is not, and he gives Gyllenhall an interesting piece of advice, ""you're the smartest guy I know, you'll never find the perfect one, just find one thats down to cook for you.""  Thoughtful advice, although it at times feels like I'm watch a tv movie.

I gave this me 2 stars because its somewhat entertaining, but not too involving.  There's a scene where the cops are having a morning meeting to talk about writing tickets and you get the sense that at times their job is as useful as a meter maid and the movie at times wants to explore that idea, but it never really goes in that direction.

A definite must see! Only thing I wil warn you about is there is alot of swearing. Specifically the F word as spoken by the gangs throughout the movie. Also there are some pretty gruesome scenes depicting body mutilation. they are very brief but they are there. I think it needed to be added to this movie to impress upon the viewer how sinister and diabolic these gangs can be.

The story follow two partners, and best friends, of the LAPD who work Central Los Angeles together, as they go through their daily lives, both on the job and off. Reminded me a little of the movie ""Colors"" with Sean Penn, but this was a much better story, in my opinion.
Good strong story, great characters, excellent casting, good action scenes, some heartfelt moments too, and some really funny and honest dialogue.  Also, the movie is shot in combat camera style, so it's very fluid which I think adds another dimension to the unfolding of the story (that would not be there if it was shot with a regular camera). Props to the editor too, because it's a lot harder to cut a movie like this, I'm sure.  I got sucked right in, in the first three minutes of the opening (which is quite unusual for a movie to have a dramatic opening), and became invested in the two main characters to the point where I wanted to know what was going to happen, and was rooting for them the whole way.

That motto was given new resonance years later in Dennis Hopper's underrated ""Colors"".  I didn't think anything new could be added to the cop movie drama and for the most part director-writer David Ayer succeeds in infusing a time tested genre with something fresh.  He does so by employing documentary style techniques such as hand held cameras that make you feel like you are in the car with real police officers.  For instance you think you are following the daily grind of Officer Brian Taylor and his partner Miguel Zavala instead of actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena.  Some have taken issue with the profane exchanges between the two which give  new definition to the term L.A.P.D. Blue and admittedly I found a tad excessive.  People curse Mr. Ayer.  We get the point.  Also, I thought the main subplot of a Mexican drug cartel putting a contract on the two a bit farfetched.  The plot strand results in an ending that I could have predicted before the film even started.  On the whole this is a fine film if profanity and violence are not an issue with you.",1380931200,,1227,4.655813953488372

I made it through about 30 minutes before deciding I could stand no more. Although I do not use profanity I fully know most of this nation has no problem with it and the issue there is a subject(the moral decline of the U.S.)for another day. But this was ridiculous. My guess is that the F word in all its' variations(noun, verb, adjective) was employed by these fine paragons of justice in excess of 100 times!!! In the first 30 minutes!! The word was SO prevalent, it absolutely hamstrung the entire show! Plot was not developed, characters were hollow reservoirs of foul language and nothing more and I actually found myself not caring what happened to these two Neanderthals. And I haven't even mentioned the ridiculous scene where the Hispanic part of this clown show is IN THE HOUSE of a gang thug and is provoked into a fist fight where he takes off his weapon and other equipment to fight him! The problems that could arise for his employment plus the lawsuits that it could bring made that scene utterly stupid. STUPID!! And did I mention that the white officer is FILMING all this for a class he is taking!! Ridiculous! In conclusion I will say this: if people think this crap is realistic...what a moron you are.

5122774,5,B008220CQU,"Written and directed by David Ayer, writer of ""Training Day,"" ""End of Watch"" chronicles the daily activities of LA police officers Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pea). Shot in South Central, Los Angeles (where the director grew up as a teenager), the film benefits from the documentary-style realism of the location shooting, but what makes ""End of Watch"" special is the powerhouse acting from the leads and a strong sense of camaraderie that develops between the characters.

The plotline of ""End of Watch"" looks episodic at first sight, with subplots about Brian's girlfriend Janet (Anna Kendrick) and Mike's pregnant wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez). You may wonder where the entire film is going, but keep watching and you will realize there is one uneasy undercurrent that erupts in the final chapter, presence of a new power (represented by AK-47) that is far more dangerous than the local gangsters.

A variety of video sources including a dashboard camera of the police cruiser is used here to present the lives of the officers realistically. The ""mocumentary"" style that is overused these days is employed effectively, enhancing the gritty touch of the film without disrupting the narrative flow.

The film's unique visual style is not for everyone, but ""End of Watch"" is a fine cop drama worth watching for the strong performances from the leads.",1379030400,,1378,5.142857142857143

Produced in the style of a backyard homemade movie,  even the quality of filming is an offense and an assault on the eyes -  one a serious amateur filmmaker would hardly lay claim to.  Verbal pollutants are often used when there is a serious absence of story, and End of Watch  is no exception.  Some viewers, however, are entertained by such and not offended when actors make millions  for just shooting off their mouths.

Well, after less than half-an-hour, I just had to tell my guest ""enough is too much"" and shut it off.  If I could give less than a star, believe me, this would be a negative 37.  Brightly shot, with jerky camera motions and angles supposed to be documentary (the premise is one of the cops is shooting the movie using button cameras and small hand-held cameras, for a school project), the acting is hammy, the premise waaaaay out there and the setting simply a place you do not want to go.

In the 2010s it's this one.

Today the barbershop chatter revolved around the best cinematic pairing of 2013, and I had a horse in the race. In END OF WATCH Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pea burrow into the skins of their characters so impressively, their characters present a friendship that feels so natural and vibes so organically, it punches you in the gut to watch the harrowing stuff they go thru deep into the film. END OF WATCH comes with bells and whistles. Writer/director David Ayer, whose dramatis personae habitually haunt L.A.'s grimy underbelly, flirts with the conceit of the found footage film but doesn't stay faithful to it. Still, there's a sense of immediacy whenever we're getting those first person perspectives, via assorted surveillance cameras, dash cams, cell phone cams, and those tiny Scorpion cameras the police pin on their uniform to record incidents. Ayer maintains a firm command of tone and pace, stringing you along and stringing you along and then sometimes pulling the rug out from under you.

The film observes the daily grind of two LAPD patrol officers and partners, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pea), as they try to keep the peace in South Central Los Angeles. The trailer fools you into thinking this is a straight-up, ba11s-to-the-wall cop thriller, but you got played. Yep, there are moments of abrupt violence sprinkled in when Taylor and Zavala spring into action, but there isn't a sustained thru arc in which they're on the run from the Mexican drug cartel. Mostly, END OF WATCH unfolds in leisurely, episodic fashion, with Taylor and Zavala responding to calls ranging from the mundane to the ridiculous to situations that occasionally do end up going sideways.

Gracing the film are these character-building intervals that lend texture and depth and give us a peek into what's relevant in their personal lives (Anna Kendrick and Natalie Martinez are marvelous as their respective love interests). What the trailer also doesn't disclose is how funny the movie is. Gyllenhaal and Pea muster up an incredible chemistry. Much of the humor stems from their naturalistic dialogue, ""naturalistic"" maybe because much of it was ad-libbed between them. The off-the-cuff patter, the smooth rhythms of their interplay provide many of the high points. It's almost impossible not to care for these guys. And when they get so successful with their street busts in ""Shootin' Newton"" that, in the third act, the Mexican drug cartel has no choice but to put a bounty on them, by then, you are firmly invested and very concerned and biting your nails. This deserves to be seen. It is visceral. It is moving. It is a slice of life. It puts you behind the scenes and in the front line with L.A.'s finest. END OF WATCH is one of those rare cop movies that doesn't exploit the badge but genuinely honors it. I was so taken by Gyllenhaal's opening voiceover monologue, I had to write it down. Boy, that was a lot of rewinding and playing back on the DVD, but worth it:

""I am the police, and I'm here to arrest you. You've broken the law. I did not write the law. I may disagree with the law but I will enforce it. No matter how you plead, cajole, beg or attempt to stir my sympathy. Nothing you do will stop me from placing you in a steel cage with gray bars. If you run away I will chase you. If you fight me I will fight back. If you shoot at me I will shoot back. By law I am unable to walk away. I am a consequence. I am the unpaid bill. I am fate with a badge and a gun. Behind my badge is a heart like yours. I bleed, I think, I love, and yes I can be killed. And although I am but one man, I have thousands of brothers and sisters who are the same as me. They will lay down their lives for me and I them. We stand watch together. The thin-blue-line, protecting the prey from the predators, the good from the bad. We are the police.""

5122848,4,B008220CQU,"Let me start out by saying in words what the four stars illustrate: I GENERALLY LIKED THIS FILM !!!!

A commitment was made to use-- and perhaps it might even be fair to say OVERUSE-- the hand-held camera technique to give the film an edgy quality . . . yes, that's obviously true.  More to the point, however, it populated it's star roles with what seemed the enactment of truly believable personalities.  And, that these characters were doomed from the beginning, this did not emerge suddenly and irrevocably, but rather slowly and in a way calculated to get you to forget about it even after you were plainly warned to expect that.

Having done street gang work myself, I was never able to forget about it at any time I was out there, because under those circumstances, if someone suggests to you JUST ONCE that you have somehow stepped into a special hair-trigger gun site, you never forget about it.  In that setting, it is just too easy to get blown away.  From that point of view, the film's effort to get you to forget about it did at times border on the silly.  Even at the end, for the Hispanic cop to get so wrapped up in the injuries to his partner that his back was an open invitation for the shooters to appear can only be naivite about working the mean streets in the course of a shootout.  No good war movie would suggest that hero figures get lost in fallen comrades in the middle of a firefight action; that occurs later, after the shooting stops and the enemy's whereabouts are accounted for.  But our guy stopped to weep while he was on the run.  It's in spots like that that the film started to get puzzling for me.  Were they willing to fracture reality to tell us how sad the guy was?  Also remember that this is the same guy who held his gun against the inside of the door of his car (out of sight) when he was talking to the Black gang member who was trying to repay him by pulling his coat about there being a contract out on them-- a demonstration of natural cautiousness learned through years of experienced that seemed suddenly to have disappeared. Moreover, professionals who have to work the warring street never react with the sort of bland confusion our heroes displayed to the notion of having a contract out on one's self.  This kind of what seemed slip ups from a Hollywood writer who's not really into that life seemed part of the I-don't-know-why efforts to keep much of the movie light-hearted.  Cops on NIGHT patrol, in particular, talk more about what they see around them as they drive through the streets than constantly distract teach other by blinding kidding with one another.  And, as if to compound the error, after what seemed completion of the film after the funereal, we get a message-- something like, ""earlier that day""-- and we see in morning light our boys-in-blue joking madly with each other in the car.  Uniformed cop's just don't work three consecutive tours (since the shootout occurred at night), and we get the wild laughter rubbed in our face again as a parting shot.  Why?  What was that supposed to mean?  Something came over the radio, but the guffaws made it impossible to hear what that was.  I still don't know what the audience was supposed to get out of that.  It left us with a final sour note, indicative of a strain of unrealistically stupid comic relief that was forced into and throughout the movie.  It's as if the people who made the movie insisted on getting their inner adolescent out by forcing a slightly ""animal house"" refrain throughout the movie.  That is a poor substitute for the kind of strained gallows humor that actually runs among professionals working the streets (what we saw instead in this movie was more the sort of ""hippie-cayay"" of Bruce Willis DIE HARD fame).  I also got the sense that the authors wanted us to see the two cops as somehow set up-- the green vision suggested observation by the ""big"" police authorities (who tried to warn our guys of the risky position they had gotten themselves into when they stumbled over human trafficking), and the way the black-and-whites had arrived so late (compared to all the other times it took so much less time to get there).  But nothing was explicitly  made of any of that.  That too was to me part of the movie's engagement in over-suggestiveness, in an excess of innuendo. JUST TELL THE DAMN STORY without ""vaguely"" suggesting all sorts of ill-fitting subplots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But, as I say, the movie was quite good, and I'm sure that it was because of how overall good it was that I felt so piqued by the silly and (at least to me) inexplicable parts of the movie.  Of course, when I read the one and two star comments, now they amounted to missing the barn wall by a mile.  I never realized people would come to a movie with such childish expectations.  The CONSTANT cursing was probably one of the most realistic things about the movie.  That's what men do in combat-- as well as women who must join them in that threateningly defeminizing context.  When the film showed the beat up woman cop who had become the victim of a man-on-man type crime (her ridding partner had been stabbed in the eye by the same man), that's when the sheer courage of these women-in-a-violent-man's-world came through most brilliantly.  That part of portraying modern sexually-integrated police was well done: constant cursing being the great equalizer for common sharing of extreme dangerousness (both sexes did it in that context).",1374883200,,5467,4.625258799171843

I had my preconceptions before I watched the film, but very quickly they dissolved and what I found rather than the usual utterly violent, gritty, angry, tough American cop drama, was a film that although about two police officers working in Los Angeles' very dangerous South Central area, known for violent gangs and big drug dealers and murders and violent crimes by the dozen, is actually a bromance, about two friends on the same 'beat' telling jokes to each other, swearing, laughing, being offensive and making sleazy jokes about their women, you know typical guys everywhere, as they ride around their pitch in LA. What happens, and I won't go over the plot or spoil it for you, is they cross serious players and then the film kicks into another gear as they become marked men. Both lead actors in the movie are very good and watchable and convincing, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena, who play the cop buddies, and there is an outstanding performance by an actor called Maurice Compte who plays 'Big Evil'; not a guy you'd want to cross in an alley on a light night let alone a dark night!

Many people don't like police officers because they get a ticket for traffic violations, but they respect those same police officers who arrest the ones who harmed their loved ones. Ayer had the chutzpah to bring to our attention the real hearts and lives of the COPS who put their lives on the line for U.S. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week - the COPS in your hometown and my hometown, and the ones whose TV program was cancelled.

5122914,4,B008220CQU,"End of Watch (2012)

Just got done watching ""End of Watch"" and i had to put up a few thoughts about it. I thought this was a pretty terrific movie. If The Wire captures what it means to be a police detective, End of Watch perfectly portrays the average completely crazy/totally boring day of patrolmen on a tough urban beat. The partnership between the two cops was fun to watch and very emotional at times. I'm not a rah-rah-rah police booster at all, but it's nice to see a film where cops aren't all portrayed as inept and/or corrupt a-holes, or as superhuman crime-stoppers, but regular people doing a hard job the best way they can. And be prepared to dry your eyes by the end.

I'm taking note of some of these other reviews here. There are a bunch of 1 star reviews for ""too much bad language""... somebody actually said, ""you need to do a better job with your ratings!"" First off, this is not a one-star film by any means, no matter what the criteria (I took a star off because the director cheated a little too much with the first person POV shots). You give a movie one star because its not well made, because it's not a good film; you don't a give movie one star because it has some words you don't like. Second, it's a slice of life action drama about two young cops working South Central and East L.A., and it's RATED R. All I can say is, what the fu.. were you expecting?

5122915,4,B008220CQU,"This is an entertaining, if a little predictable, cop/buddy movie.

What lets it down though is the 'found footage' idea.  The cops spend a few minutes at the beginning showing the cameras that they will be wearing and capturing footage on, then the whole documentary-style gets forgotten about, with some shots that could definitely not have been filmed by them.

In fact, this movie would have been just as good if it had just been filmed in a traditional style.

I like found footage movies - where the style adds something to the story.  Good examples are The Dinosaur Project and Cloverfield.

This isn't one of them - but it's quite entertaining all the same.",1371859200,,665,4.739130434782608

5122947,2,B008220CQU,"One of my fondest memories of early childhood is plopping down in front of the TV at 8 p.m. for my favorite show, Adam 12, with a little pepperoni pizza my dad would pick up from the neighborhood shop.  It was a weekly ritual.  Boys wanted to be cops back then, or firemen, or soldiers.  Men they looked up to.  And Adam 12 was, at the time, considered pretty realistic, or at least cops said it was the most like the bouts of the mundane with spurts of danger that was actual police work.  Any buddy cop show gets measured against it for me.  The issue, of course, is that Adam 12 was a product of its time, meaning that as much as it showed people at their worst, it never quite ground under its own weight in depravity and hopelessness.  At its center was the assurance that the police were doing something meaningful.

End of Watch is Adam 12 on heroin, in an alley and being pissed on awake by the next knuckle-dragging lowlife that will brutalize it.  It's one of those movies that traffics in the worst of people and offers no answers nor hope.  The police might as well be zookeepers, or maybe landscapers who just keep coming to mow the lawn because they're paid, knowing full well it will grow back again next week for no other purpose than to keep them employed.  It's jazzed up with the standard macho, smart ass posturing that passes for depth, especially when we're young.  To make it topical and I guess cliched, the white and brown leads (a-series-of-triangles Jake Gyllenhaal and happy-scrappy-sappy Michael Pena) trade racially-tinged barbs with each other, you know, to be edgy but also show they really love each other as comrades in arms.  It uses the shaky cam both to keep the budget low and to give it verisimilitude, `cause we all go through life bobbing around or fliming ourselves.

Insight never really appears.  Instead, we get smart ass quips or repackaged homilies about the meaing of life.  Lots of statements that end in ""bro"" and ""dude.""  Witness, when one  partner asks the other about how to know if he should marry his girlfirend:

""My grandma  . . . was really deep, man.  She's seen it all. Know what I'm saying? . . . Can you live without her?

Really?  That's it?  Can you live without her?  That's the best she could come up with after 50 or 60 years on planet Earth?

Here's another gem.

""Janet's pregnant.""

""WHUUTTTTTTTTTTT?""

The problem with End of Watch is that these moments of truth are as deep as anything gets.  It's one of those movies that cloaks its emptiness in poses, stares, and attitude.  No wonder nobody knows nothing.  But they're not afraid to proceed as though they do.

Fans of nihlism will tell me I just don't get it.  The lack of a point is the point, like life.  Survival is all there is.  That makes it real.  Yeah?  A bowel movement is real too, but that doesn't mean I want to watch it for 90 minutes.  I expect a little more out of art than I do out of a bowel movement.

Critics went nuts about this movie when it came up, so I suppose I had unrealistic expectations.  But, really, Southland does the same thing every week.  So did Colors.  So did Fort Apache, the Bronx.  Even then, I didn't feel stupider and like taking a shower after watching them.  I do give it props though for all the unapologetic product placement - Starbucks, Red Bull, Barbasol shaving cream - good job, boys.  Brand names get tossed around almost as often as the F word.

5122960,3,B008220CQU,"""End of Watch"" runs with the idea that everything is getting recorded today.  It shows the viewpoint of the urban police officer on duty and how the job affects lifestyle, as well as a window into the life of a gang member. The cinematography and dialog are raw and realistic and often entrancing.  This is not a boring movie.

The problems with the movie are pretty overwhelming, however.  Although there is much foreshadowing, there is very little plot. The protagonists barely scratch the top of a sinister drug cartel operation, yet they are powerless to even investigate it.  Then they go about their duties and lives until they accidentally turn over a proverbial stone that gets them into big trouble without their even realizing it. The ""boss"" bad guys are practically an afterthought and play a very insubstantial part of the action.

The acting is great, but the characterization in pretty much stock. The policemen are all portrayed as flawless knights of justice, while the gang members are caricatures of evil incarnate (going so far as to name the leader ""Head Evil"").

Its an entertaining glorification of the LAPD but there is so little resolve of any of the issues it broaches that it feels incomplete. Think of the show ""COPS"" crossed with a indie character study film.

5122965,5,B008220CQU,"'End of Watch', is the only cop film ever to capture the spirit of interaction between 2 ghetto cops and the sort of comments they make to each other while patrolling.  In my case, being a minority (3rd Generation Japanese-American), similar to Mike Pena's Hispanic character in this film, paired with a testosterone-fueled white male partner, who was quick with the ethnic slurs, reminded me of working with Bruce Kameg at the 1st Precinct in the late 1970s.  I read many of the reviews of the film here, on Amazon.com and it's interesting that people either loved and endorsed the film or HATED it, with little reaction in-between those 2 extremes.  There are many cop-haters in the world and some who saw this film said they much preferred 'Training Day'. The reason is obvious to me-the horribly 'bad' cop portrayed by Denzel Washington enabled those cop haters to reinforce their already negative opinions of how corrupt and rotten cops are.  Other negative reviews came from law enforcement types who are desk jockeys, paper shufflers or have worked only in suburban areas, where the big call of the night is ""a drunk at the 7-Eleven'.  They are in no position to judge the authenticity of this film, because their experiences are so different, they might as well have taken place on another planet.  Ghetto policing is a whole different experience and it's a young man's game, often performed by coppers with a high school education, at best. Some critics didn't like the ""immaturity"" of the characters.  Like it or not, that depiction is real, not about ALL ghetto cops, but many.  A flippant attitude can be essential for mental survival in an insane environment.  Some said the camera was too jerky and watching the action made them sick.  Welcome to the real world of ghetto cops-in particular the fight near the beginning and the jolting car crash, which began the final action scene.  The jerky camera action really 'put you there', making me feel like I was back on the street.  It might not be 'pleasant' to experience, but it is realistic.  On my first night on patrol, (I was still in the academy) I was sent to the Vernor Pct for 'In Service training'.  I rode in the back of a patrol car, with an experienced 2 man crew. After sliding back and forth on the back seat,  racing from one priority call to another,  and drawing my gun 7 or 8 times in a single night, I felt like I'd been on a roller coaster for 8 hours.  I said to myself "" I don't think I can do this s*** for 25 years.""  But some of us did adapt to that crazy world and I remained on uniformed street patrol for 25 years, on Detroit PD.  Other negative reviewers (and there were MANY with this objection), stated they couldn't stand the obscene language that was so pervasive in 'End of Watch'.  Go back and watch the film again.  Although the cops are prone to swearing (which is accurate), 90% of the F-bombs in the film are spoken by ghetto gang members-welcome to reality.  Again, this was totally realistic and the 'emotional violence' which Joseph Wambaugh recognized as a major component of the police experience is captured perfectly by the black actor who fights the Hispanic cop at the beginning of the film.  I read that he is in fact a real gang member and street guy and the torrent of obscenity and disrespect that flowed from his mouth in that scene was 100% similar to the verbal abuse I listened to, for 25 years.  This also transported me back in time, to hear that obscene dialogue.
Most of the severe critics of this film are basing their opinions on what?  Their years of working at Dunkin Donuts or perhaps the many police movies they've watched?  The director of this film wanted to get it right and the 2 main actors spent months riding along with LAPD and LA Sherriff's crews, to get a feel for what they actually say and do, while working.  Learning of their preparation for these roles was what nudged me to go see the film.  It is very accurate on many levels-I know, because I've lived much of that experience.  The only thing that was way over the top, was the amount of shooting at the end.  Even in ghetto policing, that is not nearly as prevalent as shown in this movie and when it does happen, it's usually over a lot quicker than the prolonged gun battle at the end of this movie.  But that is typically Hollywood  and is inserted to add box office appeal.  The basic premise of the film required one or both of the officers to die at the end, but this could have been accomplished in a much briefer space of time.  I believe one reason response time was prolonged in the film, is that cops who call for assistance always 'perceive' that it takes forever for help to arrive, even if it is a matter of seconds or a few minutes.
Other aspects of the film which have been panned:

 By my calculations, I made over 15,000 traffic stops in my career and I never had the occupants of a stopped car come-out shooting, as was shown in the opening scene of this film.  However,  this DOES occasionally happen and footage captured recently on real life police dashboard cams, shows that the scenario looks VERY similar to what was depicted in 'End of Watch'.  In another traffic stop scene in the film, a citizen's gun arm is grabbed by a cop, just as he tries to shoot the cop.  MANY ghetto cops have grabbed a firearm out of the hands of a hostile citizen.  I once grabbed the barrel of a .12 gauge shotgun and deflected it away from me, after walking-up behind a armed citizen who had just shot at his neighbor (it later turned-out this citizen had two prior murder convictions on his rap sheet).

As to the scene where Pena takes off his gun to fight an abusive citizen, that also DOES happen occasionally.  I know of a FEMALE Detroit cop, who did that and whipped a strapping 22 year old young man, with a big mouth. They teach in the academy never to do this, but Pena's character was a ring boxer, which was revealed in one of the unfortunately deleted scenes. So he was capable of doing things the average cop would not attempt to do.

Other negative reviewers of the film resented the fact that cops were portrayed as occasional heroes in the film.  I never crawled along the floor of a building engulfed in a raging fire, to save occupants of an apartment building before the Fire Department arrived, but this happened to my partners one night, when I was off.  Going-in to a situation like that, with no adequate fire retardant clothing or breathing apparatus is nothing short of heroic and would be like expecting a fireman without a gun to take-on an armed felon. Yes, my partners did that, in a Cass Corridor apartment building and they saved some lives. One of them (Michael T. Walsh), happens to be the son of a Detroit fireman.
In short, many of the experts who have condemned this film don't have any idea what they're talking about.
My final comment on this, is to all the cop haters and also the chairborne desk jockey types, who never get out on the street and care only about getting promoted.  Your reasons for hating this film are obvious.  As to the bluenoses who can't stand hearing dirty words in a film, their objections should in no way reflect on whether this film is an accurate depiction of reality, in big city policing. On the contrary, the horrible language is just one more realistic aspect of this film. Patrolling the Cass Corridor of Detroit, in the 70s-80s was very similar.  'End of Watch' has nailed the ghetto policing experience more accurately than any Hollywood film, to date.",1369440000,2,7531,4.530672579453067

5123009,3,B008220CQU,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'End of Watch' was written in six days by Writer/Director David Ayer. The story focuses on two LAPD cops, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyallanhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pea), on patrol in their squad car in South Central Los Angeles. Taylor is shooting a film project (not sure why) and both officers wear miniature cameras on their lapels. The idea is to give the narrative a documentary feel. At other times, however, Taylor and Zavala are shot from a third party perspective--one wonders if this is supposed to be shot in a real-life documentary style (in real- time), who is supposed to be filming Taylor and Zavala, independent of Taylor's 'flim project'? Obviously filming the entire story from the two officers' perspectives, just wasn't working and Mr. Ayer was forced to adopt the more traditional third party viewpoint, for a good number of scenes.

I assume that what Ayer did here was to take some of the more sensational 'inner city' real-life cop stories and condense them into a more fast-paced narrative. Hence, some of Taylor and Zavala's encounters are quite gripping. I'm thinking particularly of the scenes where they find the two children duct-taped in the closet while the parents waste away in a crack den, another scene where a whole group of human trafficking victims are found as well as the discovery of dismembered corpses, victims of a particularly vicious drug cartel.

Not all of the police officers' machinations ring true. When Zavala decides to fight Tre, a Bloods gang member, and afterward refuses to charge him with assault, it's difficult to believe that a police officer, would put himself in harm's way, merely to earn a gang member's respect (the beat down could have resulted in serious injuries for Tre, along with a lawsuit--resulting in Zavala's job being placed in jeopardy).

More unlikely is the idea that the drug cartel would go out of their way to target LAPD members on a number of occasions. Recall this happens twice in the film: the first time, one cop is stabbed in the eye and another one is severely beaten in the face. Then there is the film's climax, where the protagonists face the 'end of watch'. I realize that in Mexico, cops are targeted all the time by drug gangs and cartels but I have not heard that many stories about American law enforcement being directly challenged by these out of country lawbreakers. Would it really be in these cartel's best interest to directly target LAPD officers? After all, they're in a business where they don't want to call too much attention to themselves. And by assaulting and even murdering LAPD officers, that would lead to the enmity of an entire department. I realize that the cartel hire the local gang bangers to do their dirty work but such select targeting of LAPD by the cartels would result in vastly increased scrutiny as well as retaliation by law enforcement.

'End of Watch' also covers the private lives of Taylor and Zavala. Most of the time, they rib one another but also display passionate displays of loyalty (particularly during the tragic climax). The ribbing gets a little tiresome as there's a little too much of it during the film. I particularly was annoyed by the little flashback that was tacked on after the funeral. Why was it necessary to serve up another scene with the partners once again busting on one another. The crudity of their jokes obviously is designed to show that they are 'ordinary' people but showing that directly following the solemnity of the funeral, diminishes their heroic stature.

The 'End of Watch' climax is heart-pounding as the officers are cornered by gang member mercenaries, conscripted by the drug cartel seeking revenge. But the gang members themselves are so over the top, that we can't take them seriously. And the awkward way in which they are taken out, hardly seems realistic at all.

'End of Watch' features two excellent performances by Gyallanhaal and Pea. There are also a series of fairly shocking scenes involving what LAPD officers have encountered during their travails while on the 'beat'. I didn't buy everything, particularly the idea that drug cartels would invite trouble by specifically targeting LAPD officers. Still, there's enough here to keep your interest, despite the obvious exaggerations.",1368144000,,4315,4.943448275862069

End of Watch follows the patrols of Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pea), two policemen in South Central Los Angeles. We watch them drive the streets, engage in shootouts, encounter violence against a female policewoman, catch drug smugglers, discover a torture house, and stumble on a human trafficking hideout. But these are all supporting elements to the relationship between Taylor and Zavala.

Conversations during the late night patrol shift, figuring out who to marry, sharing memories--these are the building blocks of the film. There is no single ""bad guy"" who they're trying to take down. While there is a group of criminals that come to the fore and end up being given a directive to neutralize Taylor and Zavala, the focus remains on the friendship.

That's the highlight of End of Watch. It's worth watching just for the relationship between these two characters. They are partners facing a city rife with Hispanic-Black ethnic tensions, drugs, guns, and trafficking. There is definitely some social commentary when it comes to ethnic divisions in urban environments and the disturbing persistence of crime in American cities. End of Watch also pays tribute to the great service policemen provide to society, despite the cynical attitude we've grown accustomed to when it comes to law enforcement, and the sacrifices their families and loved ones must make.

5123035,5,B008220CQU,"Well color me impressed. Out of all the movies I've seen recently this was the one I was expecting to let me down. On the contrary, it was exactly what I was looking for and then some. End of Watch was a thrill ride from start to finish and I honestly couldn't have asked for anything more.

End of Watch follows the story of two policemen, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) & Mike Zava (Michael Pena), as they do police work (shocking). The film opens with Brian and Mike in the middle of a chase while Gyllenhaal gives us some spiel about policemen and how they're important to keeping order, yada yada yada. The beginning of the film also shows off what I think is this film's biggest fault: the way it was filmed.

As you watch End of Watch you'll see the camera switch from regular, steady recording to that of a home movie. This is because Brian is taking a film class and he's recording police activities for a project he's working on. Now this wouldn't be a big problem if it would have stayed within the police work, but it doesn't. Almost every scene has at least one person with a damn camera so this recording style follows you throughout the entire hour and 40 minutes. The Mexican gang had a video camera (because that makes sense), Brian carried the camera to a quinceanera, during his wedding someone had a camera, I mean it just never stops.

With that said, I'm pretty impressed that this is the film's only fault. One of its biggest achievements, on the other hand, has to be just how well the story is written. I mean it is intense. It does a great job of sucking you in and keeping your attention throughout the entire thing. What's even better is that it's filled with characters that you both like and care for. You don't want to see Brian or Mike get hurt, you want them to succeed in whatever crazy task they accept while on the job, and you want to see their relationships work out. Sadly, we don't always get what we want as this film proves that not every story has a happy ending.

This connection wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for the fantastic performances from Gyllenhaal and Pena. I've only seen these men in a handful of films, but they've given solid performances in everything I've seen from them. With that said, I think Gyllenhaal really stepped up in this and Pena might have given the performance of his career. It's some really powerful stuff and the ending is bound to leave you speechless.

On top of the two main guys you have Natalie Martinez and Anna Kendrick playing Gabby (Mike's wife) and Janet (Brian's girlfriend), respectfully. Then you have David Harbour, Frank Grillo, and America Ferrera each playing someone working on the force. In the Mexican gang you have Big Evil played by Maurice Compte and La La played by Yahira Garcia. While I don't think any of these actors had enough screen time to go toe-to-toe with Gyllenhaal and Pena, everyone gave solid performances even if I didn't necessarily like their characters.

Overall Score: 9/10 - End of Watch proves to be one of those films that delivers in what it sets out to do. It's not often that I leave a film blown away by what I saw, but End of Watch is one of those films. The story is gripping and the movie is driven forward by some fantastic leads. I'll give you a warning though, this is not for the squeamish. There's a few decapitated heads along with a male officer who has a knife stuck in his eye and a female officer with her face beaten in. If you think you can handle something like that then I can't recommend this movie enough. Definitely one of the best cop movies I've seen.",1367539200,,3610,4.462121212121212
5123046,5,B008220CQU,"I went in expecting this to be an entirely different movie; this was a good thing.  The writers did a great job with the dialogue, and the actors pulled it off so convincingly (especially the leads) that it was easy to forget you were watching something scripted.
Given how much the movie sucked us in, some of the scenes were difficult to watch; which was likely an intentional and appropriate choice by the creators, as the brutality and horror of these scenes turned out to be meaningful, rather than just for shock value.
I plan to recommend to all my friends, and watch it at LEAST once more, if not buy it and put on a treasured section of my shelf.

It's a buddy cop movie that slows down enough for you to discover the characters and the dynamics of their working friendship. Much like the job of a police office the speed of the move would go from 5mph to 100mph then back to 5mph in the span of seconds. It's a little graphic at times but I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good action flick about the day to day life of being a cop.",1367452800,,561,4.063063063063063

5123149,5,B008220CQU,"End of Watch is one of those films that you have seen many times before in many TV shows but it has so many great moments that you begin to care for the leads and the film. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are young police officers who bust a drug cache and make enemies south of the border. David Ayer has been writing about crooked cops for a while, he wrote Training Day and Harsh times about corrupt cops on the verge of insanity. However in this film, the cops are actually heroes - they are green, clean and brave. Brian Taylor (Gylenhall) and Mike ( Mike Zavala) are best friends and honest police officers. They love each other , their families and are brothers in every sense of the way. On their daily watch, they investigate different cases some involving fires, burglaries and warfare between black and hispanic gangs. Most of the footage in the film is found footage apparently on a camera that Taylor loves to carry with him through the film. This is great film and a reminder to the rest of us who don't like their jobs because there are other jobs out there which are far more dangerous. 5 stars. 4/7/2013",1365984000,,1121,4.446601941747573

5123152,5,B008220CQU,"I'll be honest; I almost didn't bother watching this.  Buddy cop films are so overdone these days, I'm sick of watching them.  Add to that the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal is NOT a name that evokes any confidence in me as of late and you had this film that I didn't care if I saw or not.  Despite the acclaim it got and the great ink for the central performances and the critics and audiences reacting so favorably, I seriously had no interest in seeing this; at all.  So, to say that the biggest shock for me this year was my actual adoration of the film (and of Gyllenhaal's magnificent performance) would not be an understatement.  This movie was really, really good.

Sharply written, edgy, steeped in a really slick sense of comradery and anchored by two beautifully fleshed out performances; `End of Watch' will keep you glued to every frame.

The film is shot almost like a documentary, utilizing gritty camera angles to bolster audience reaction.  It follows the relationship between two cops, Brian and Mike.  They are reckless and childish and yet devoted to their jobs and the responsibility they have towards the people depending on them.  They joke around, indulge in inappropriate talk and bicker like kids, yet at the end of the day they are brothers at heart and are truly stand up guys.  As the film progresses we see them push themselves in order to get more out of their jobs.  They follow up on leads, do their own investigating and uncover some serious stuff.  In the meantime, they agitate some local deviants who don't take their intrusiveness lightly.

Gyllenhaal and Pena make a great team here.  They capture every layer of these men and have an infectious chemistry with one another.  The rest of the cast is certainly up to par, but these two men form a great foundation for the film itself.

It's a great change of pace for the average cop film.  It speaks to the honor of the men in uniform and makes them real people, are may have flaws but are certainly not flawed.",1365984000,2,1994,4.584745762711864

White knuckle suspense and violence that seems truthful even as it comes at you from out of nowhere. Beautifully rendered characters in both the writing and the acting.

I was initially skeptical when i heard Jake Gyllenhaal but was pleasantly surprised when I saw this film the first time.

The fact that it does such a good job of portraying these two characters as real people made the movie more appealing to me. There is some action in this movie but it is not an action movie.

Yes, there are many of the usual police cliches mixed with the rich ethnic jargon heard in the melting pot of American Culture, never more evident than in The City of the Angels!  The film touches upon their personal lives and loves, weaknesses and strengths as most other Police dramas do however this film bonds the two as few others have---like the catalyst solidifying their fatal belief that each is invincible in ""watching my partner's back"" amidst the danger and horrors of law enforcement........Be prepared to meet a new kind of evil, that which kills without feeling, preys upon the weak and defenseless, and bleeds the humanity from its inhabitants with arrogance and indifference----Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena masterfully play off one another as the infallible street cops whose bravado is matched by only by an over abundance of testosterone until one fatal bust goes down...whatch gonna do when they come for you?",1364860800,,1220,5.004926108374384

Of course there are too many gun battles and pursuits when most of police work is pretty uneventful marked with periods of sheer terror and excitement. This movie displays some serious high and low points of being a police officer. It took on a challenge to show what some have to deal with within the limits of a couple hour movie. They actually did a fairly decent job.

I've been in Law Enforcement since 1996 and I have had some of these same experiences in my life. Not all at once and I certainly never had to deal with the Cartel or anything like that, but I've been in pursuits. I've been scared to death because of the unknown and I've witnessed some of the horrible things people do to one another. This movie depicts a great deal of this.",1364860800,,859,4.302469135802469
5123254,3,B008220CQU,"I personally truly enjoyed watching the film ""End of Watch.""  I do not think however, that it would be everyone's taste.  Perhaps that is why it did not make a great deal of money in the theaters.  First, I will tell you what I liked about the film.  I enjoyed the interaction between the two main characters played by Michael Pena and Jake Gyllenhaal.  Also, the film showed their interaction with their families, Pena has a wife that he obviously loves greatly and Gyllenhaal meets the girl of his dreams and ends up marrying her in the movie.  The intensity of their relationships adds texture to the movie.  Also, Pena's character and his wife have their first child.

I did not particularly care for the fact that Gyllenhaal's character was filming everything for a film class that he was taking.  It kind of made things a bit confusing and created a lot of undue tension between the other officers and his character.

The film had a truly great amount of violence.  The most violent scene showed another officer getting stabbed in the eye.  Perhaps the violence did further the plot but it was really graphic.  There was also a scene of a woman being raped that was graphic as well.

There are many stereotypes in the movie, but that just may be the way things are in Los Angeles.  The police in the movie are mostly white and they are trying to keep the neighborhoods around them from blowing up everyday.  Drugs are prevalent and guns are readily available to everyone.  As a matter of fact, it seems in this film, that the people on the streets, have more weapons than the police and of course, they also outnumber the officers.  This makes for continuing tension and some give and take between the street people and the authorities.

The police are quick to honor the work that they do with awards and commendations. The characters are portrayed as heroes but one of them has to give up his life for the cause.

All in all, I enjoyed the movie but I would caution others that if they feel squeamish about blood and gore, they should skip this movie.",1364860800,,2059,4.543478260869565
5123255,5,B008220CQU,"The two main characters were realistic

We don't think much about Police work and simply take it for granted. The movie shows more about what Cops have to deal with during a shift. Granted, it very much depends on their beat and where it is located, but there are dangerous areas and a cop can quickly die if not careful.

The two idiotic characters in this movie are incredibly immature loser cops who I could not relate to nor did I care about them. The script is awful as it features the two vulgarian cops using tedious amounts of foul language throughout the movie. The characters even imply that they are closeted bisexuals. They get into various dramatic circumstances involving gang violence and burning houses: in each situation it casts ethnic minorities in a criminal, incompetent, and or vulgar light. The message that this movie sends across to the viewer is very offensive. I do not recommend this overhyped piece of garbage movie for these following reasons: the plot has already been done before; it portrays ethnic minorities as severely incompetent or vulgar; the characters are irritating and immature; the violence is undistinguished in quality; shaky camera filming; and the script is terrible.

In fact, those residents who have a more proximal and years-long relationship with the LAPD might also have to view this film with an entirely new mindset that will require them to actually sympathize with the LAPD instead of throw their shoes at the screen. But it is possible.  The two cop protagonists are young guys who don't carry the same baggage of racial disdain that their older peers do.  They are the LAPD we ought to have--able to identify, mix with all sorts of people and see them as humans first.  These guys would never fire 50 shots at a blue van with two elderly hispanic women inside figuring the occupant is a large black man.  They arrest people, they don't execute them hoping to avoid paperwork as a result.

End of Watch is an entertaining and even sad cop story about duty on a tough beat.  Given the horrifying stuff these cops run into on a daily basis, (crimes done exclusively by usual cast of scary black and latino people) you gotta ask, ""who in their right mind would even want that job?""",1363564800,,1112,4.53

Hopefully, no officer with the demeanor of these two knuckleheads is going to keep their job for more than a few months.

5123409,5,B008220CQU,"As a former police officer (now a lawyer) and my husband a former police officer (he is a fireman now) - we thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

The conversations were very realistic, the joking behavior and mannerisms.  This movie made you cry and laugh.  It was violent at times, and showed the other side of the law.  It also accurately portrayed that officers are people too, and that they have lives outside of the Department and Badge.

This movie allowed others to see that - while you may be upset at getting pulled over for speeding or in an accident with no injuries - that you have NO IDEA where the cop who you are dealing with was.  He/she could have been investigating a dead body, a burglary, a rape, a child abuse.  They could have just come from court where someone was released on a technicality, and they are going to break the law, again.

I also really enjoyed the fact that it allowed normal public people to see that some cops love their job, and want to help society.  And that there are some complacent cops.  The complacent cops tend to be the ones rewarded, and the ones who dig for ""the dirt"" and help to get the bad guys off the street - can be the officers placed in danger and targeted.

We bought this movie and watch it frequently - it reminds us of the time we both spent on the street.  While our experiences were similar - we wouldn't trade them for anything!

This film is Ayer's debut as a director of his own script.
It is basically a story about two LA cops who are partners and good friends, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena.
Gyllenhaal's character loves to use his digital camera during his daily patrol which the director used the shaky
camera technique to land some realism but annoying and caused dizziness to the viewers.
There is not much of a story other than about the two cops daily routine and family life.
For the two lead actors, Michael Pena gave a more nuanced and controlled performance.

This has great cop humor along with touch cop love (the brotherly kind as well as the spousal variety) . . . and I have to say that I was so engrossed that I didn't see the ending coming. It's laid out there for you as the story unfolds. And when you get to then end, if you missed it but you were paying attention, the moment when you could have known will come back to you and kick you.

Brilliant. Plus excellent performances by Gyllenhal and Pena. You absolutely believe they're cops.

5123499,5,B008220CQU,"Being a police officer in south central Los Angeles is a scary thing. At least it is in David Ayer's End of Watch, a movie so well made and shot in a semi-documentary style, that some have viewers have mistaken for ""found footage"" , that you never question it even when the violence reaches extreme proportions.
 It feels real there for in the mind's eye it is. An unflinching and edgy portal of  big city police life. At times it's a heroic look at police work, at others it is a violent thriller and a dark and depressing look at the daily evil hidden behind locked doors, at times it even feels like a horror story.
 With a bald and buffed bad ass Jake Gyllenhaal and the excellent character actor Michael Pena giving the performances of their respected careers, at least up to this point. Starring as two dedicated LAPD patrol men. They are best friends, brothers they say, they believe in the service that they offer to those in need.  They don't aim to be heroes, even after a heroic deed, they still say they do not feel like heroes. They are just average realistically portrayed guys.
 They find themselves in over there heads in the three major food groups: ""drugs, money and guns"". Just reinstated after a justified on-duty shooting, these ""ghetto gunfighters"" prove to be a more than a little reckless when they begin an unauthorized investigation that leads to Mexican drug cartels operating in L.A.
  End of Watch recalls the late Dennis Hopper's great, but largely forgotten Colors, which starred Robert Duvall and Sean Penn. Colors was to cop movies in the `80's what Platoon was to war films.
 So much of End of Watch depends on it's two leads, and fortunately they deliver. Gyllenhaal and Pena are two of our best actors working today, here you will see a different side of Gyllenhaal and a star making turn by Pena. They camaraderie and friendly banter make these characters seem more flesh and blood than in most movies.
 Written and directed by David Ayers, who's well known for his screenplays for movies like Training Day and, uh, the original Fast and the Furious movie. He has also directed two prior films, the reasonable Christian Bale-Freddy Rodriguez thriller Harsh Times and the dismal and dire Keanu Reeves and Chris Evan starrer Street Kings. Up to know Ayers has appeared to be somewhat overrated, even Training Day peters out in a terrible and obvious third act. But here with End of Watch Ayers really finds his niche and proves for once to be a first rate filmmaker, perhaps one coming into his own.
 This is also a change of direction for Ayers. Not an obvious one, at least not on first inspection, but it most certainly is. Instead of corruption in the department, he has good guys here, the new direction is a good one for him. Ayers seems fascinated by cops, LAPD ones precisely, but has never had the nerve to celebrate them before, he feels comfortable in doing so.
 I think a lot of people will be surprise by just how funny the sharply observed dialogue is, as two punctuate the grim realities in the film. A down and dirty gritty film for sure, but the amiable lead performances make it one of the most enjoyable.
 End of Watch doesn't offer much new and like a lot off movies these days it relies to much on shaky cam movements, but it does take us into the heart of darkness that is rarely explored in movies any more, the harsh realities of this world. Like all the best movies, it is more entertaining than you might suspect, and make no mistake this is one of the year's very best.

5123519,1,B008220CQU,"First, this movie gained very little from it's POV shooting style, and it added little to their ability to tell a story.

  The final third of the movie really didn't make much sense.  Why did the street gang go after these two regular patrol officers?  What did they hope to gain?  Didn't they understand the risk they would be taking?  And after the two officers left the apartment where they took shelter, why did they continue to hunt down their attackers (even though they were clearly outgunned), instead of trying to hide and protect themselves until help arrived?

  Overall, a single typical episode of the TV series Southland is much better than this movie, giving more meaningful stories about the lives of LA police officers (with stronger characterization).",1362268800,6,770,4.9453125

5123533,5,B008220CQU,"Every so often and yet not often enough, a movie comes along that rocks me to the core. 'End of Watch' is one of those movies. I thought this movie was fantastically made, brilliantly directed and superbly acted. I was on the edge of my seat throughout, I cared about the characters, I wanted to know what the outcome would be, I laughed, I gasped, I cried and was left with nothing but sheer admiration for everyone involved with this production.

The Movie was written and directed by David Ayers who you may or may not know as the director of 'Harsh Times' starring Christian Bale and the screenwriter for 'Training Day' with Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke amongst other works.

The two principal characters in the movie are played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena.

The movie centres on Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena), who are close friends and partners in the Los Angeles Police Department. Taylor is filming their police activities for a film project he's working on. After shooting two suspects following a high speed chase they are placed on suspension and return to work after they are cleared of any wrong doings. After staking out a house of a known drug user they follow and then pull over the man in a 4x4, who was seen taking a metal pot from a woman. As Zavala approaches the driver's window to make contact, the driver suddenly draws a gun and fires. After arresting the driver, Taylor removes the pot from the 4x4, and kicks it over, thus removing the lid. He finds an ornately-decorated .45 Colt automatic pistol, and a gold-plated AK-47 rifle, along with a large amount of money. They find out that the money and firearms are connected to a Mexican drug cartel operating in the notorious South Central area. A convict who they are familiar with and had a run in with earlier tells them that they have been marked for death. They don't really take this threat too seriously as all villains want to kill the LAPD in South Central.

Taylor has just got married and Zavala's wife has just given birth and now something will go down that will change both of their futures forever in a fast paced, emotionally charged drama that will have any discerning member of the public gripping the edge of their seat.

I  can't say enough about this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and everyone involved with it should be proud of what they have created. It is gritty, hard-edged, poignant, relevant, uncomfortable, frightening, shocking, disturbing, enlightening, pulsating and above all engrossing.

Seeing as one of my best friends is a fire-fighter and his wife a police officer, this movie makes me appreciate how unpredictable and difficult their jobs are, not that I didn't know that already. I know that comparing South Central to the Midlands in the UK is stretching it a little but in these harsh times (apologies to David Ayers) in doesn't matter what area in the world you are policing, it is a dangerous job. I think we should all doff our caps to police officers and fire-fighters around the world as they all risk their lives to keep us safe every day, sadly at times with very little credit.

The thing that strikes me about the movie is that it gels without ever seeming to be structured. What I mean by that is that it obviously is structured through the writing process but you can see that Ayers has used hours and hours of footage and edited the final piece to the footage used. This gives the movie that documentary type feel, especially with that added element of Taylor filming himself and his partner. This does not take away the fact that the craftsmanship is there for all to see. It is an astonishingly well put together movie and it exudes boldness without trying to be too clever.

The title itself 'End of Watch' comes from the real life tag that police officers use for cops who are killed on the job. There is a famous book entitled 'End of Watch: Chicago Police Killed in Line of Duty 1853-2006' that encapsulates this whole grisly circumstance. The book was written by Edward M Burke and Thomas J. O'Gorman and I am not sure how much of an influence it had on Ayers script or whether he did indeed take his idea from it. The book contains stories of 526 law officers from Chicago who died in the line of duty, including photographs and the circumstances in which they were killed. So that leads you to the question 'So they die in the movie?' Well, do they both die? Do they both live? You'll have to watch the movie to find out.

I like the way the opening shot is filmed from the drivers prospective of a police car as it chases a criminal in another vehicle. Jake Gyllenhaal narrates over this scene and it starts the film off with a bang. It also opens the way for the cam shots that are to come. I thought at first that I may be put off by the first-person cam view but to be honest it isn't used too much in the movie and when it is it is used well and is not off-putting in the least.

Ayer took hours of film footage to the editing room and it was a huge job to piece it all together. I think he did a fantastic job. Overall it took him thirteen months from writing the script, through transition to completion. That is not bad considering the subject matter and the things that an LAPD cop in South central goes through in any single day.

The movie is shot in colour but contains black and white scenes too due to the cam footage. The cinematographer on the movie was Roman Vasyanov and this was his most high profile film to date. He does a good job as everything seems to blend together and some of the shots as they travel along in the patrol car with the sun setting and the street lights dazzling are really effective.

The original score was provided and performed by David Sardy who has produced the scores for '21', 'The Green Hornet', 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Wanted'. It fits in with the grittiness of the film and plays well off some of the music tracks from the soundtrack.

The movie was made on a budget of seven million dollars, which is not an awful lot by today's standards. I am pleased to say that it doubled that on its opening weekend and has grossed almost forty million to date and that is not including ant sales of the forthcoming DVD and Blue Ray. So in terms of commerciality, the movie can be deemed a success. David Ayers is known for his movies about the police and this is the flavour of his movies 'Harsh Times', 'Training Day' (script writer) and 'Street Kings'. I liked Harsh Times, thought Training day was brilliant but sadly didn't like Street Kings. End of Watch is by far his best movie for me and after Street Kings has put him back on the map.

Ayers Produced the movie too and Jake Gyllenhaal liked the project so much that he executive Produced and effectively put his money where his mouth was along with Ayers.

I would recommend this movie to anyone and I will freely admit that some people will not be able to look past the violence, gang related scenes and swearing but all I can say to that is each to their own and it is a shame because you are missing a cinematic treat and a master class in acting and a realistic portrayal of some of the bravest men and woman alive today. I apologise to all the cult fans of the original 'Precinct 13' movie but I think End of Watch is the best cop movie ever made. End of watch for me is a triumph and I give it five out of five stars.

The timelines don't make sense and story would have had more freedom if it didn't rely on home video angle.  Other than that, it was a fine movie, pretty violent, and some parts were thrilling.

5123573,5,B008220CQU,"Superior movie.  The way it is filmed makes you feel like you are right there.  It's intense, with parts of it being harrowing.  As someone who has worked along side law enforcement and has family and friends that are police officers...this movie hit almost too close to home.  It is as authentic of a portrayal of cop life as you will probably ever get in a film.  Loved every second of it.",1361836800,,391,4.375

After I watched it I continued to watch it over and over. Within the first 2 days I had watched it at least four times. Something about this movie I think everyone should watch it at least once.

5123589,4,B008220CQU,"This is quite a realistic portrayal of what it is like for some LA cops to patrol in drug and gang infested areas of LA. It does not paint a pretty picture of LA. It could just as easily describe ""burned out"" areas of any major city in the U.S. It also likely sets some records for profanity in a movie. I watched it for its reality. But there are at least a few scenes that may offend blacks. It would probably have been just as accurate to show Hispanic and white racist gangs. The cop bravado is probably very isolated for LA cops, though I am sure it exists. There is definitely a macho police element. Part of this is just a Hollywood filter on it. But it does get at the inside the culture of many city police squads that have a ""we're going to get them before they get us mentality.""",1361664000,,790,4.136363636363637

Have never had a better idea of the day to day grind of being a police officer, a job where you risk your life every day for total strangers, and at the end of the day still can't leave it behind you. I've felt for a long time that Michael Pena is one of the best actors walking around working today, and this film was total confirmation of that - Jake Gyllenhaal, as well, turning in a performance equally real (the film comes off more like a documentary, it's that real, down to the chemistry of Pena and Gyllenhaal as partners sharing the same squad car). Visceral, full of tension, and so realistic in its depiction of a cop's life as to be unsettling, this is a must-see.",1361664000,,802,4.248366013071895

The best parts are with Taylor and Zavala with the back and forth in the police cruiser, you can see that it was honest and not full of s*** like other cop movies. I have seen it now over five times that is how great a movie this was. It showed how you can relate to these two street cops. Some very funny and poingnant..

5123627,4,B008220CQU,"I sat down to watch another cop thriller, hoping it would be a pretty decent one. END of WATCH stood out in an unexpected way. It's a brutally realistic, super-violent, and gory film that, miraculously, shows just enough to avoid being cheaply gratuitous in any of these respects. While it's not Gyllenhaal's finest role, he's still quite good here as Officer Brian Taylor, and the acting in general is likewise. Many of the gangster-actors (some of whom apparently came from the background shown in this film) give especially strong performances.

Taylor and his partner (similarly well-played by Michael Pea) encounter violent rival gangs, drug cartels, house fires, mass murder, and human trafficking rings in an unusually rough section of South Central LA. The not-so-subtle hints that the top echelons of the LAPD (along with certain federal agencies) are bedfellows in some of the gangs' most appalling activities add an interesting twist. While the storyline is not perfect--e.g., some of the gangsters are amazingly bad shots --END of WATCH is better than any other film I've seen that portrays urban cops as soldiers in enemy territory. The two lead characters' family lives are also realistically shown, along with the sometimes friendly, sometimes not-so-friendly camaraderie and politics within the police division. Great dialogue!

This is another fictional ""home-film documentary"" related partly in first person by the protagonists, and another reason why I have to downgrade a little is that the sometimes jerky camcorder does nothing but annoy. I realize that many people like this technique; however, I don't see what it adds or why the story could not have not have been told from a standard third person POV.",1361491200,,1727,5.231046931407942

The story could have been so much more, but the dialogue was poor as well.  The plot had a lot of potential but fell far short.

5123678,3,B008220CQU,"Sick & Stupid Score: 7/3*

This is another movie about Los Angeles as a giant septic tank.

If you like straight-up cop movies, you will probably like this movie.  If you are tired of the I love you like a brother cops riding around in a patrol car, avoid this movie.  Also, if the somewhat goofy, out-of-control cop partners seem like a worn-out theme to you, avoid this movie.

I found no fault in the acting and was rather surprised at the creative scriptwriting, since I had no idea a sentence could be constructing by simply stringing together F-words.  However, I disliked this movie for both technical and philosophical reasons.

Technically, the movie is a camerawork disaster.  The movie unsuccessfully tries to merge cinma vrit techniques with standard cinematography.  There are cameras everywhere, and the audience has no idea whose view of events it is seeing.  Is this the cops personal camcorder, his vest camera, or the patrol car camera?  Or have we reverted to the set camera, and we are now getting the cinematographers point of view?

Philosophically, this movie raises a very serious social question, which it does not answer:  What is the purpose of LAPD?  When they are not trying to enjoy normal lives with friends and family, all we see in the film is our two beat cops rushing from one horrific, murderous scene to another.  Racial minorities rampage throughout the movie, taking and selling drugs, killing each other, killing cops, wrecking everything.  Our two hero cops seem to be making little or no progress.  The situation is hopeless.  The next question then arises, Why is the LAPD even wasting its time with these people?

I would not have expected that prior to seeing the movie. Michael Pena did an outstanding job as well and he aced the back-and-forth insults/jokes that takes place between officers. They must have hung around some urban cops as part of their research for the roles.

If you don't enjoy cop movies you might not ""get"" this comparison, but I put End of Watch as most similar to Narc (an very underappreciated cop movie). I am not talking about the storyline, but rather the directing, the general tone of the movie, and how it call came together. Simlar to 95+% of cop movies, you have to allow the director a LOT of suspended reality. Some of the absurdities are what make the movie interesting to watch. They did do a really good job illustrating the camaraderie between the officers.

I am glad to see somebody in Hollywood remembered how to make a good cop flick. Over the past decade or so the best cop movies seemed to be coming out of Korea and Hong Kong. (One Night in Mongkok, 2009: Lost Memories (cop/alternate history movie), Infernal Affairs (even sequels were good), etc...)

5123732,2,B008220CQU,"End of Watch(released Sept/12)stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Brian Taylor,Michael Pea as Mike Zavala,Natalie Martinez as Gabby and Anna Kendrick as Janet,among others. This film is one that tries its darnedest to portray a ""realism"" between a couple of cops patrolling the mean streets of south L.A.The directors use portable hand held cameras in a myriad of angles to give the viewer a you-are-there feeling. Also Officer Taylor is constantly carrying around a hand held camera for a ""project"" he is doing. Convenient. However,as inventive as the producers of this film thought that would be,it is something that we have all see dozens of times. And THAT in itself wouldn't be so bad,if the slow and meandering stop-start of a plot didn't rain down a-plenty on this cop fest parade.
The story begins with a car chase,at the end of which our two protagonists,officers Taylor and Zavala,take down the occupants of a vehicle in short order. From here we become observers/flies on the wall,if you will,both visually and audially,into the officers banterings,thought processes and their friendship and careers,which bond them together. We also get a look into the regimentation and daily routine of a cop,as the two go from start of shift to end,answering various calls,some mundane,some not so.
Things start getting a little tight as the two inadvertently discover a human trafficking ring in a house. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency swoops in and takes control of the situation before they have a chance to say or do anything. On ICE agent tells them that this house is operated by a huge drug cartel and that they may have bitten off a little more than they can handle,and warns them to lay low. Time passes,Taylor gets married and the two,back out on the street,make another bust in a house. This time they discover a grisly scene with plenty of packed up drugs and body parts. This time the drug cartel sits up and takes notice and puts a hit out on the two.
A local bandito by the name of Big Evil and his posse of hacks,are given the job. The trick is to get the cops alone. They do this by having one of their members make them chase him in a vehicle. They follow him into an open aired apartment complex and the posse open fires on them with automatic weaponry. The two are temporarily pinned down in an apartment and barely manage to escape. They make their way along an alleyway,praying for backup. At one point they are fired on and Taylor gets it in the neck,bleeds profusely and passes out. As his partner hovers over him we hear a click. The camera rises to reveal Mr. Evil and his posse right behind Zavala. They open fire and he collapses to the ground. Backup arrives soon after and the resultant exchange of gunfire takes the entire posse down.
The film ends as Taylor attends his partners funeral and we see a flashback of the two in better times,riding in the patrol car.
The opening scene is where the film goes downhill. For all the realism it tries to portray,the take down of the occupants of the vehicle is just TOO Hollywood-ish. The occupants of the chased vehicle get out and start shooting. The officers get out and coolly and methodically take them down as if they were walking into a doughnut shop. Then they high five each other afterwards. Between calls received,the plot is a meandering one as they introduce each main character and sub characters. After a while,actually quite quickly,this on again,off again roller coaster wears very thinly. Very early on you start clock watching and can't wait for this thing to end. Never a good thing with a film. No matter how good the acting cast was,they just cannot overcome the sedentary plot. I might also ask,why is the excessive use of foul language,heard to such a degree here,frequently used as a writers tool to reenforce that""realism"",when it needn't be?
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and s clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all a disappointment. The film tries to portray the lives of two L.A.cops in a gritty and ""realistic"" fashion,but the meandering stop and go plot works against it throughout. Also the so called ""realism"" leaves alot to be desired.",1360713600,,4185,4.7579092159559835

5123744,1,B008220CQU,"Writer/Director David Ayer, who has made a cottage industry in the police thriller genre, brings nothing new to the table in this meandering cinematic wreck.  Jake Gyllenhall and Michael Pena are introduced right off the bat as LAPD patrol officers in the mold of countless other big-screen cops: They play by their own rules, they ignore their superiors but they get results, etc., etc.  The duo are also presented as good friends and partners, but that's the first of the film's many problems: This deep, important friendship that should form the core of the film is simply established as if it were some immutable law of nature, with no real explanation of why they care for one another so much or how their partnership came to be.

After running afoul of a Mexican cartel's operations in South Central, the duo finds their lives in danger - but only for the last 15 or 20 minutes of the film.  The rest is largely plotless, covering the officers' daily patrols over the course of an indeterminate period of time and the constantly escalating horrors they face on the job.  This shouldn't be a problem, as procedurals and thrillers have used the mundane details of life on the beat to great effect, but here nothing comes together or has any weight until the film suddenly begins moving toward its clunky resolution.  Before that point, though, Ayers throws in a lot of typical cop drama scenes about the partners idly chatting about their lives, but the script never takes them any deeper than ""This job is dangerous"" and ""I want to have a family some day.""

It should also be noted that a ""found footage"" conceit is established early, and ignored for the rest of the film.  Ayers goes to lengths to show that Gyllenhall and Pena are equipped with cameras as part of Gyllenhall's college art class (A paper-thin justification which is never mentioned again,) but the majority of the film is shot via non-diagetic sources.  By the end of the film the only reason the cameras seem to be there are to give other officers another thing to reprimand them for.  I can't count the number of times another officer tells the heroes to turn off their cameras.

Anna Kendrick shines as a Prop - it's difficult to call her a character, given her tiny amount of screen time and lack of real personality - introduced for no discernible reason other than to reenforce the heterosexuality of Jake Gyllenhall's character.  (The male leads say ""I love you"" to one another far more than they do their respective romantic interests, ostensibly to show how deep their on the job partnership is.  One senses the studio got cold feet about people potentially misinterpreting that.)  Natalie Martinez, playing the wife of Pena's character, is given even less to work with and makes even less of an impression (Save for one enjoyable scene where she is given a chance to actually do something on camera other than look worried.)

I can't stress it enough - ""End of Watch"" is a mess of a movie.  Avoid.",1360627200,8,2980,4.7129094412331405

Gyllenhaal & Pena were the best I have ever seen them, they make their relationship 100% believable, one of the few movies I have watched where I forget I am watching a movie and buy into the plot like it's actually happening in front of me.  The supporting actors were also believable in their roles.  I think twice about renting movies highly rated by film critics (as I usually disagree with the majority of what most of them have to say) but they were spot on with this film, it is a must see.  I will add that it is deserving of it's R rating for violence and language, they didn't have to pump this movie up with too many over done, out of place sex scenes, instead it focuses more on good solid relationships between partners and their cop brothers as well as their own families, and the conflicts of being an officer and what our police officers get at home when they put their lives on the line to save civilians.

5123768,2,B008220CQU,"Though both major actors in this movie are extremely talented and worth watching in just about everything I have seen them in, this movie is most certainly a smudge on the ""resume"" of both actors. The movie may have been made by the same people that brought us Training Day but there is no comparison as to the quality of the movies.
This movie is seemingly a rah rah propaganda piece on the selfless all giving that police officers all supposedly lay on the line to help keep us all safe and secure. Reality is a different story. Police officers are nothing more than after the fact data collection clerks. There are VERY few crimes that police personnel prevent, very few. Mop up is about all they do and they get paid way too much for what they do. Are there casualties? Certainly. The same can be said for every other public employee involved in any physical activity. Garbagemen get injured far more frequently than police officers for example.
The majority of a police officers time is involved in the very dangerous intervention in domestic disputes. That is one ""plus"" that the police are indeed needed for. Far too often policemens duty involves drug related offenses. These are generally victimless crimes, and yes I know the general retort about the damage done to the user. That is what God called ""free will"". The ongoing and never ending ""war on drugs"" has caused far more physical and property damage than the effects of the gamut of drugs out there ever would have.
Do I feel sorry for police officers? Not at all. They made the choice when they applied. Many applicants can do little else that pays anywhere near what a policemans salary does. Far too many police officers abuse the power granted to them. Abuses which are very seldom addressed. When was the last time you heard of a policeman actually being punished for a ""questionable use of force""? Rarely.
This movie is another flick shot by way of the ""Blair Witch Method"". PLEASE, lay off the hand held amatuerish technique. It is overused and covers a lack of real film making technique.
Didnt like the movie at all, have no sympathy for police officers and would really like to return to the days when directors really had to do their job. Enough already with the shaky, handheld video B.S.. Also, please give some thought to saving some of the billions this country annually spends on the failed war on drugs. Prohibition in any form will never work and only serves to provide employment to people that would otherwise have to learn a useful skill to earn a living.",1360454400,,2542,4.66369710467706

5123828,4,B008220CQU,"I'm a review reader. So of course, with the mixed feelings of people, I went into watching this flick not certain I would care for the film style. The beginning is a very fast cut (quick jumps from scene to scene) that can make your head swim a bit. I like this kind of cinematography but the first 5-10 minutes was extreme. Either I adapted or the editing slowed down.. after that time it didn't bother me.

Overall the movie was enjoyable. The comments about language: didn't phase me in this movie. The lack of plot: I don't agree. Its not deep by any stretch but I did feel the movie kept building. I guess what bothered me the most was the unrealistic camera angles thrown in. So both cops have a clip on cam, there is a handheld cam and the gang recorded its own footage. And somehow there was footage found from a Central American cartel. We'll even throw in the cruiser cam footage. So who filmed the rear of the vehicle and focused on the ""Interceptor"" emblem as both cops pulled up to a scene? This happens too many times during the movie (unrealistic angles) and it distracts from the found film genre that the movie was trying to achieve.

Overall, a watchable flick. 3.5 stars out of five. Its not epic. Its not deep. Its not a family film. Its raw and taps into that dark side of life. That alone makes it unique enough to watch.",1360108800,,1343,4.346613545816733

Most of the complaints I see in reveiws are about the filming style. Yes, it is filmed like a home movie, but to me that brings you closer to the action and closer to the characters.

Wasn't quite sure how all of the parts were going to fit together for the inevitable ending. Parts of the story are regurgitation of overused plot lines from other police partner movies, which makes some parts predictable. Was a little disappointed as to how the turning point in the plot, near the end, was handled. A bit too simplistic as compared too the rest of the  movie. Overall though if you like police, drama and action movies, you will find this movie entertaining and worth the price to rent. I did enjoy it, I liked the characters and actors portraying them, and do not regret renting it.",1360022400,,744,4.593984962406015

Few cops ever have a run of action as ""enjoyed"" by our heroes, but the story about our heroes and their hearts and lives behind the badge is compelling and very realistic.  Jake Gyllenhaal is very good but I thought his partner - I regret I don't know his name - had the more challenging role and was superb.  Violence is graphic but believable - if you have ever been in a real fight you will understand.  Down and dirty, on the streets movie.  Would have been equally good without the high glam background of the drug lords fighting the cops.  The ending of the movie is common amongst police - how it happens is usually much less dramatic.  A don't miss movie!!!!",1360022400,,706,4.46875
5123847,5,B008220CQU,"This is not an action movie.  this is a movie about the friendship between two partners which will make you laugh and cry.  A heartwarming tale that takes place around danger.  It is filmed using handhelds, so at times the camera can be a little nauseating (not as bad as Cloverfield).  There is tons of action, which is incredibly suspenseful.  You feel like you are right there with them.  There are a few scenes which are extremely violent and hard to watch.  They show violence against women.  All this only makes you understand the characters better and doesn't take away from the story line, which is fantastic.

The dialog is weak and unbelievable in every sense of the word. The story is a joke. The actors can't decide if this is a comedy or drama, and so you are left with neither. Every scene is Blair Witch coupled with a story line and dialog that leaves you wanting to punch the writer in the face for thinking you are such an idiot.  I literally couldn't stand it 20 minutes in.  I took a 2 hour break then resumed the movie giving it one more chance.  20 minutes later I gave up.  This is the worst movie I have seen in years. There is nothing to see here, nothing at all.  I called Dish and demanded a refund, and they gave me two free movie credits instead.

The cinematography is terrific and, thankfully, the film isn't overly wedded to POV shots even though one of the characters carries a hand-held camera everywhere he goes. Still, cop movies come a dime a dozen, and it's an easy genre in which to produce a lesser work because of the temptation to fill up gaps with action scenes and (over the last three decades or so) a stream of profanity that would make most of the principals in The Aristocrats blush. Thankfully, both of these things are present in abundance in this film, yet what rescues it from becoming still another flashy but ultimately vacuous gritty-in-your-face-yet-diversity-sensitive-ethnic-mash-up-So Cal cop drama is the decision to focus on the relationship between the two cops rather than on the plot. What makes that decision work is the stellar chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena. I can't praise their work here enough; there is hardly a scene in the film with one of them that doesn't have the other in it, so their relationship had to be believable. I would, in fact, go so far as to say that the film is worth seeing (and, ultimately, studying) just as an example of a film carried by the platonic, though profound, relationship between its two main characters.",1359849600,2,1326,4.924107142857143

We had to overlook all the errors and ""Yeah, right."" moments, but I really liked the show until the end - when I thought we still had an hour left and it was over!

There was the start of a big, involved storyline when the partners  stumbled upon a human trafficking/drug cartel(""Follow me through the door."") which I expected to dominate the last half of the movie.  However, it just kinda disappeared and life went on.  Or maybe I missed something?  Pretty sure I didn't fall asleep.  Anyway, that storyline never really went anywhere and next thing you know, the movie's over.  Left me confused and unsatisfied, and looking incredulously at my watch.

I also found the woman gang-banger unbelievable. She seemed like an actress who would belong more on a TV sitcom or chick flick than in this kind of role. Maybe the gang-bangers had something to do with the cartel but it just wasn't enough. It could have been so much more indepth and intense.

5123971,1,B008220CQU,Jake Gyllenhaalj and Michael Pea did a very good job. The script was AWLFUL! The writers used the F bomb as if it was its own form of language.  A shame to waste the talents of these actors.,1359417600,,190,4.0

5123973,2,B008220CQU,"Poorly done and excessive POV shooting from cops side, enemy side, random locations...etc, was too much, and very unrealistic. Would bad guys really film themselves plotting to murder cops?  What happens if they lose the tape? Would good officers in the field really focus more on wanting to capture footage, even while under fire, than on doing their job professionally or save their lives? Additionally, from a cinematic standpoint, the angles were poorly done and distracting to watch over time and, again, took away from what would have been an above average movie. This movie is nothing like the masterpiece, 'Training Day,' so if you were expecting an equal to that, you will be disappointed.

On another note, the directors sadly chose to make the two lead characters all-in-one heroes, even when it totally undermines the credibility of the film. Our two protagonist fill the duties of firefighters, street cops, and detectives/special agents all rolled into one. In fact, so good are they, they can go into a fully involved house without PPE and survive the temperatures and gases that would kill in seconds anyone else. They also perform casing/stakeout operations without warrants or backup. This film, unfortunately, was too much, too poory filmed to live up to the high expectations I had for it....",1359417600,,1312,5.097674418604651

I usually can't stand cop and robber movies because Hollywood makes them so unrealistic and just plain stupid.

This movie was so intense that I felt ""disturbed"" when it was over. That hardly ever happens to me after watching a flick.

I was expecting the guy humor.  I was also expecting action and tense situations.

What I didn't expect, that exceeded expectations...

- Some of the deeper thematic elements, like the bond formed between people that entrust one another with their lives.  But, more than that, the bond between their families...the sense of extended family between officers.
- The on-screen dynamics between the lead actors.
- The insight into what being a cop can be like.  Makes me thankful that people out there give of themselves to perform this function.
- I wasn't expecting the sadder elements...the sense of loss...the tough situations.  Very dramatic and something easily realistic.

5124036,5,B008220CQU,"End Of Watch is one of the most compelling Cop Dramas in years. Told without the usual Hollywood fanfare and formulas. we're pulled inside the multi faceted lives of two officers, partners in the war against unspeakable crime in South Central LA -and pulled deeper my the moment into the extraordinary friendship of two partners who become Brothers in Arms in every sense of the word.

I was a huge fan of Training Day and although the style at times reflect the filmmakers style don't expect the ""action' not the story to be anything like it. Yes, there's violence here - but it's realism and the mere peek of it is never gratuitous but essential. It's the raging fire in which a bond is forged and the fate of a friendship forever forged.

Jake Gyllenhall and Michael Pena are sensational on screen and both have shown unexpected an most welcome acting chops - the scenes between them range from high energy funny to gutting intensity. Dialogue is fast and electric, it's raw and it's real. As for the supporting cast there's not one hollow performance the entire cast must have known or felt this project was special - and special it is.

There are no bad cops here and no super heroes, just men and women who represent the finest of a police force that sees more human devastation in a single day then most of their brothers and sisters in other parts of the country will see in the summation of their entire career. The film knows this but it doesn't grandstand it simply play homage and respect to all those in uniform for the right reasons and who's personal sense of honor is palatable throughout the entire film.

It takes a seriously strong stomach to handle the little speech Gyllenhaal is saddled with as the movie opens - I can paraphrase it as ""cops are the most amazing people in the world and also a bit like Terminators"".

5124080,3,B008220CQU,"Considering the raving reviews, and not just from critics, I went into this movie with high expectations, AND I wanted to like it. I really enjoyed Training Day, which director, David Ayer produced. So I figured End of Watch was going to be of the same ilk. Not so. Let's count 'em down:

1. PRESENTATION: While the whole shaky camera thing was effective in some parts and quite nifty in others, on the whole, it became rather annoying, especially during the fight scenes. I mean, really? Someone in a brutal fight was holding a camera? I know that if I was in one of those confrontations, I would want BOTH of my hands. Just sayin'!

2. DIRECTION: Considering the use of documentary-style filming, it was done quite well; cameras were literally everywhere. It must have been quite an uptaking for the editing department. Even though Mr. Ayer wrote the script, he didn't give himself much to work with. It took a long time before I could determine where the story was going ... close to 45 minutes. That's almost half the movie--ridiculous.

3. ACTING: As everyone has noted in other reviews, the camaraderie and chemistry of the two leads was exceptional, some of it a bit tongue-in-cheek and ambiguous, but exceptional, nonetheless. The cartel members, especially ""Bad Evil"" and his girlfriend were WAY over-the-top with WAY too much overplay. I have been around people like that, and no one, NO ONE, says the F-Bomb that frequently. Sure, it comes up, but not with every other word as depicted here. The only time I have truly witnessed that type of repetitiveness concerning profane words in a purposeful situation was at a George Carlin concert back in the '80s.

4. STORY: Weak, at best. As already alluded to, the story really didn't get going until the middle of Act 2. There was simply way to much time focused on back-story. It could have been presented in such a way that would speed up the whole ""get the audience to care about these characters"" process. That would have freed up more time to allow a more expansive focus on the primary narrative.

5. OVERALL: Overrated. This movie is on par with being nothing more than a good episode of Southland. It is on par with every other ho-hum, so-so cop movie. Not bad, but not great. I liked some parts, and I had to suspend my belief system for others. It is a parity, but not (thank goodness) a parody.

Three stars: ***",1359158400,,2380,4.654761904761905

5124086,3,B008220CQU,"I was fighting with myself throughout the entire movie on whether I liked it or not. I really did want to like it. Especially after watching the trailers and reading the reviews on it. I ended up being impatient and rented it as opposed to buying it. I planned to buy it later if I enjoyed it. After watching it, I will be waiting for a good sale to buy it. But I must say, a lot of the appeal for me is the fact that it is a police movie.

While the camera was kind of annoying at times, I wouldn't say that's a major gripe of mine. But some of the camera angles were annoying because of the way it was supposedly shot. It should have been done differently, and the reason for it was pretty ridiculous. I like the in car cameras, but the handheld camera in one of the fights scenes is ridiculous. But it wasn't so bad I wanted to turn off the movie.

I did really like the main actors. They did a great job at their parts, but I really do feel like some of the parts were ""over-acted"". There was mainly one part that I wanted to say ""really....?"" because every other word he said was the f-bomb. I have no problem with cussing in movies, but it becomes corny when they overuse it. That, on top of them trying to hard to personify the stereotypical police officer, are the reason I would say some parts were over-acted.

My last gripe would be..... I guess time management. It seems like they spent a lot of time on the back story. Mind you, I love movies where they really want you to care about the character, so they use back story. Then, if in danger, you are really pulling for them. While they did succeed at this, they overdid it. They did a good job at establishing the fact that these guys were like brothers, loved their significant others, etc... But they overdid it in the sense that there was a lot of scenes in the car where there would be sort of pointless chat that does nothing but keep the story from progressing. It goes from story building, to just spinning it's wheels. They just needed to get to the plot sooner. Once the movie gets to the point, you sort of say to yourself ""ah.... so this is what the conflict in the movie is.""

With all of that being said, the movie really does pick up in the second half. I just wish they would have focused more on the conflict, versus pushing the fact that we needed to realize these guys were like brothers. If the first half was more story oriented like the second, I would probably give it five stars. It just seemed like in the grand scheme of things, some of the first half was unnecessary. The second half is what I expected from the movie. The ending was also great. They did an awesome job of wrapping it up, and while the ending was unexpected, I'm glad they took the risk with it. Not only did it pay off, but realistically, that is the only way out of that whole situation. (minus backup showing up AFTER the fact...) This was definitely helped by some of the back story, but I feel like the same feelings towards the main characters would have still been there without as much random chatting. The last half of the movie could have actually been the entire movie. Mainly because there is some character building and character advancement, and then it gets to the main plot, conflict, and the ending. Had that been the movie, but more appropriately extended so it's more ''movie length'', it would have definitely been 5 stars.",1359158400,23,3400,4.3078125

And the script, while occasionally funny and insightful, seems rather rote and nowhere near the writer's excellent Training Day.

But to top that off this BD has absolutely zero features, which a film like this could really benefit from. Discussions of the cartel problems in the USA that the corporate media almost never touches (ask yourself why), moral issues of the LAPD's history, and plenty of other topics could and should be addressed on commentaries and featurettes etc, as with almost all new blu-ray releases now. It's part of why they get away with charging so much for these discs which cost the same as dvds to make. So apart from a decent transfer here, why bother buying the BD?

A great movie. I really enjoyed the movie. Good character development and back filling of the history between the two officers, our heroes, of the movie.

While some might say that the movie plot is standard, perhaps so. But the telling of the story and how things progress had enough side elements to it that kept me as the watcher engaged and entertained and feeling for the characters as well. You got to see the human side of a character type that is stereotypically portrayed by Hollywood, IMHO, as being tough as nails and without feelings or remorse but instead just a robot. Not so with these two officers.

If you enjoy a good cop drama, with good cops and not bad ones (think Denzel Washington in Training Day), you should really pick this up. The shooting style took a bit of getting used too, much like Homicide: Life On The Streets was an acquired taste so will this movie be for you. But you'll get used to it within the first few minutes and then it'll be a non-issue.

You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll feel like you know what it's like to see the things that real police officers in a sprawling urban environment like The City of Angels must go through.

Enjoy the movie.",1358899200,,1455,5.200854700854701

Sure, the two officers told lots of jokes, but I never really cared about them.  What actual investigation did they do?  Why did they deserve to be killed?

How about the anatomy of the hit?  How was it scheduled?  Its plot wasn't developed at all--just phone call, gangbangers talk, then BANG.  What about the anatomy of the cartel?  How did it operate?  Who were its leaders?

The idea that a policeman would film his life was fine, but all the ""Look at me!  I'm on camera!"" really took time away from actually telling a story from multiple angles.

5124119,5,B008220CQU,"David Ayer does not shy away from raw stories.  He is a facile writer and edgy director responsible for such impressive films as Harsh Times, Street Kings, Training Day, S.W.A.T., The Fast and the Furious, Dark Blue and Ten.  In END OF WATCH he steps into another arena of manipulating the camera technique to emphasize not only the speed with which the LAPD must react but also the in-between moments when boredom bonds officers tightly and some hilarious buddy talk is born. What he achieves in END OF WATCH is probably the most realistic (albeit heinously gory and terrifying) footage of what cops do and how they live and survive in a series of incidents that boggle the mind.

Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) are cop partners who do their job in a amazingly skillful manner and at the same time demonstrate that they have formed a brotherly bond that makes us identify with them immediately: Brian learns the ins and outs of marriage from Mike who is completely committed to this wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez) and Mike encourages Brian to commit to a relationship with his current love Janet (Anna Kendrick). In the midst of all of this bonding the two officers deal with car chases, child endangerment, drug cartels, human trafficking, and a horrendous confrontation with a Mexican drug cartel gang that leads to a brutal end to the story.

To capture the immediacy of both the good and bad aspects of the endangered lives of Brian and Mike the entire film is shot with hand held cameras, and surveillance cameras -a technique that director Ayers even endears his audience by having Brian be an addict to hand held cameras shooting the fun parts of their lives as well as the terrifying parts. The dialogue sounds spontaneous and is overwhelmed by expletives that in previous years would have been bleeped, but now with social media absorbing everyone's life the words are simply common language and keep the story real.

Gyllenhaal again serves notice that he is one of our more gifted actors on the screen today and Michael Pe&ntilde;a's performance is so astonishing fine that it is Oscar worthy as Supporting Actor.  The other LAPD personnel given screen time include excellent portrayals by David Harbour, Frank Grillo, America Ferrera, and Cody Horn.  Both Anna Kendrick and Natalie Martinez are strong as are the actors who portray the gangsters.

The technique shooting this film, the dialogue, and the incessant picturing of horrendous scenes may be off putting to some, but it is good to see good cops doing what they do best - place their lives on the line to protect the citizenry. In all this is an outstanding film.  Grady Harp, January 13",1358899200,3,2696,4.856209150326797

5124132,3,B008220CQU,"Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe&ntilde;a have a great chemistry in this movie and help to carry a fairly leaden script through the slower parts. They are easy to believe as good friends, partners and cop buddies and certainly the dialog lends itself to creating an authentic relationship between the two.

Unfortunately, the amateur-cam filming style is distracting and unnecessary and not even consistent throughout. It's never explained why all these separate parties are carrying video cameras and in certain scenes they revert back to an unknown third party camera presumably because they couldn't figure out how to put a camera in the scene (who's filming Gyllenhaal and Kendrick's love scenes?). All in all, it would have been a better film to shoot in a traditional way without having this distraction.

The main plot is slow to start too. The first act is spent showing what great cops our duo are and while we get to witness some exciting action, when the bad guys decide to take them down, it all feels very rushed. As a result, the film is very strong on character and atmosphere but the plot's not well structured enough to act less like TV and more like a movie.

Ultimately, End of Watch provides an exciting ride up to a point but after the film you don't feel you really discovered anything.

End of Watch is story of two policemen working in rough South Central Los Angeles.
Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a former U.S. Marine, who is about tired of being a player and looking for a one-man woman.
Miguel Zavala (Michael Pena) on the other hand married his high school sweetheart, has a child and a sense of community.
The two are best buds on the job, and off.
They take a public disturbance call. They find Tre, a large black man, with much attitude. He heckles Miguel with racial insults telling him he wouldn't be talking tough without the badge and gun. Egged on by his partner, Miguel drops his gear and accepts the fight. He wins winning the respect of the criminal.
The next call is missing children. They find the children duct-taped in the closet, the guardians stoned and lucid. Just another day at the office.
Taylor meets Janet, falls in love and marries her. Miguel and his wife, Gabby, have a second child.
At work they stumble upon ornate weapons, cash and a room full of trafficking victims. ICE agents warn them away, that this is cartel business. But the boys want to make a name for themselves, so start to investigate the source. Meanwhile the cartel puts out a kill order on the officers.
Gyllenhaal and Pena underwent five months of training for their roles, including 12-hour ride alongs through the toughest parts of L.A. Cool but very gritty and violent movie.",1357776000,,1463,4.71484375
5124161,2,B008220CQU,"While I like Gyllenhall and his co-star, this is another of the movies that should have afforded a tripod. Because hand-held camera works is justified by a few lines in the script, I can understand the use of shaky camera in some scenes -- even though we are never told exactly what project Gyllenhall is working on that causes him to carry a camera. The movie is a series of episodes. I had some idea of what the plot was supposed to be, but I was still surprised that the movie seemed to be half-over before the first real plot element comes into the action. By the time the plot was underway I felt so nauseous from the camera motion that I had to walk-out. I actually did throw up.
I would like to know exactly how the movie ends, but what I saw of it, and the cliche nature of what I saw, I can guess at the ending -- and whatever I imagine is probably more creative that whatever writer/director David Ayer came up with.
Maybe this is more watchable on the small screen. I would not recommend it to anyone who is sensitive to motion sickness.",1357776000,5,1048,4.271356783919598

I have to say that after watching the movie I was very surprised to find how powerful the movie was. the movie is a first-person narrative so you have to enjoy that type of movie as it makes you feel like you are part of the movie and with the characters as they go through the drama as well as the plot of the story that is being told. The actors within the movie did a great job and train their characters and it is a very raw look at law enforcement and the job they do. The movie attempts to show reality within law enforcement and to that end the ending of the movie is a much more reality-based ending then and some other movies of a similar topic. One of the things that I really liked about the movie was the relationship between the two main characters, as you really get to see the bond that has developed and develops in a partner relationship within law enforcement. This was a well conceptualized movie with good acting and great cinematography. The action and drama within the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you asking for more in the end.",1357344000,,1195,4.218340611353712
5124165,3,B008220CQU,"Let me start by saying I completely changed my opinion of this film by the end of it. About 3 quarters of the way through, I was around a 2.5, but things really pick up in the film toward the end: emotionally and dramatically. There are a few things I really liked about this film, the biggest being the partnership of Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena's characters. Fantastic chemistry here. There's a perfect balance of arguments, ball-busting, and serious conversation to be had here. I feel safe saying this is one of the best buddy-cop match ups EVER. There are quite a few laughs in this movie, which is rare in such a dark film. I liked Anna Kendrick in this (mostly because she is my current Hollywood crush). There was also a healthy balance of work and personal life, which in turn contributed to the great character development in this film. I felt myself REALLY caring about what happens to these characters, which is a rare feeling when you watch as many movies as I do. I was also pleasantly surprised with how emotionally charged this film was, especially at the end. Great performances from Gyllenhaal and Pena make this film good.

I won't elaborate on the many reasons why I am so opposed to the ""found footage"" approach, but I will say that one of those reasons is that it is so overused. Project X, Cloverfield, and Paranormal Activity are three films in recent memory that try and fail using this method. This film did a slightly better job at using this technique, but like all ""found footage"" films, I was left feeling dizzy nauseous. That is my biggest issue with this film. This easily could have been one of my favorite films of the year, but the use of this choppy, shaky shooting style takes away from the sophistication of the story. I can see how they were going for the ""Cops"" look, which could've been done better as TV show, but for film, this is a style that shouldn't be used. This also caused issues throughout the film because we were being beat over the head about where cameras were, and there were one too many ""get that camera out of my face"" moments. The documentary style seemed forced, and that definitely hurt the score for this film.

In conclusion, if the shaky-cam doesn't bother you, this is a good buddy-cop film that has a serious take on the drug war and is very emotional. Great performances from the leads helps distract you from the aesthetic problems in this film, but you will still leave the theater wishing you watched a ""film"" rather than a bunch of splices of footage.

5124169,4,B008220CQU,"Interesting, moving, tense if sometimes uneven mix of very rough,
hand-held visual style, improvisational feeling acting, and occasionally
much more conventional plot turns. This study of two slightly gonzo,
gung-ho, but basically righteous Los Angeles cops is alternately deeply
engrossing and affecting, and occasionally frustrating.

When it all works, it feels about as real as any police drama I've ever
seen. (It's also too rare to see an heroic Hispanic lead character in a film
about a city where Latinos make up a huge part of the population)

When it gets in it's own way -- as when the camera-work becomes so
self-conscious that you start thinking about it (Why do so many
characters just happen to have cameras? Why are many of the shots from
angles that could never be from a home video camera, if this is
following a ""found video"" conceit?) or when the acting occasionally
stops feeling real and suddenly comes off as self- conscious improv. Or
when our heroes are in firefights that look real, but follow Hollywood
rules of logic as to how they turn out. At those points the film can be
maddening, just for undermining how good it is when it's on target.

Still, very worth seeing, and far more interesting than most of what
comes out of Hollywood.",1355529600,3,1263,4.811059907834101

5124171,5,B008220CQU,"I was hesitant on watching this movie.  It looked like your average bang-bang shoot 'em up film, but went ahead and watched it.  From the start to the end, the movie had me entertained and drawn in waiting to see what happens next.  If you don't like the first 5 minutes of the film, then turn it off because it's probably not for you.  But if you do, keep watching because it only gets better.  I will have to say the movie is gory in the sense that it looks realistic.  The story line is great and makes you feel like your in the line of duty with the actors.  During the movie I found myself getting more attached to the characters which is what the movie was designed to do (obviously), but it plays an very important part for the ending.

What sets this movie apart is the ending (very end) which was a GREAT way to close the movie and is no where near being cliche.  This movie really is a work of art in which many have imitated, but few have done it correctly.  I would highly recommend seeing this movie. If you love action, suspense, brotherly love or cop movies you'll definitely like this one.  Even if you're an action junky this movie will keep your attention.

If you loved both Training Day and Cloverfield (which I do) then this movie is spectacular.. It is shot with a blend of true 'Blair Witch' stile of filming with similar 'Training Day' ride alongs in squad cars. The similarities end their however as 'End of Watch' has been modernized from the old 'Rampart' scandal (Training Day) to the current events of the ever encroaching run-amok drugs cartels and their increasing chock hold into American Lives. 'End of Watch' is in fact about a very serious topic but has a lot of racial humor (which is actually funny) mixed in, making their characters identifiable, and overall enjoyable to watch.

Their lives become chaotic when they stumble upon a human smuggling ring which in turn makes them the targets of a very deadly mexican drug cartel. This movie was very captivating and the found-footage technique that was used in this movie only enhanced the story even further. The acting was excellent by all of those involved especially the two performances of Michael Pena and Jake Gyllenhall [these two guys need to be nominated for oscars next year]. I also love how this movie has a great sense of humor throughout without it taking away from the overall feel of the movie. Over the course of the movie, You really begin to like and appreciate the efforts of the two main characters to fight crime in one of the most dangerous cities in America as the many scenes of the two main characters conversing in their squad car really provide some of the most entertaining scenes of the movie [as well as some of the funniest]. Also, the comedic scenes really do prepare your heart for the more disturbing events that occur as the film progresses [trust me, things get very ugly in the second half of the movie]. Compared to the many cop movies that have came before it, End Of Watch certainly is one of the most down to earth and realistic police drama's you'll ever have the privelege of seeing.

5124182,4,B008220CQU,"End of Watch realistically portrays the reality of cop life on the rough streets of south central LA.

It tells the story of two partners Brian (Jake Gyllenhal) and Mike (Michael Pena). At first it appears more like a documentary than a movie, and highlights the camaraderie between officers and rivalry within the dept.

The opening scene featuring a high speed chase on a dash cam followed by a fatal encounter is all shot through the single cam with editing. I found this to be quite impressive giving a realistic feel.

As the movie progresses it seems driven more by events than by story which I personally found to be a refreshing change from typical cop movies. As it lacks the slick production you typically get in a police procedural it invites us into a more realistic experience.

Brian is the more introspective cop who used to be in the Armed Forces, and Michael the more gregarious one. There is great chemistry and humor between these two, as they discuss their dreams, first times and so forth.

The story emerges when these two accidentally uncover a human trafficking operation and run foul of a Mexican drug cartel. Brian's curious nature leads him to ignore the advice of a DEA agent and follow up some leads himself, which has potentially fatal consequences for he and his partner.

We explore the romantic relationships of these two, one married, the other just beginning a relationship with a girl played by Anna Kendrick (Up in the Air).

We explore the interactions with different villains one of whom challenges Mike to put down his weapons and see if he can take him physically. A fight ensues. The ultimate outcome of this fight may save both cops lives.

Brian carries a camera with him giving a cops eye view on several scenes. Sometimes this did seem impractical and a little dangerous and unrealistic, and sometimes I did find the shifting between perspectives a little jarring. Later though this does become interesting with the climactic scenes.

I think the best way to watch this movie is not to know too much about it in advance and just experience it. I found the experience to be well worthwhile and was thankful to be able to see it while still in theaters. I think though there is little advantage to seeing it in theater compared to waiting for the dvd.

It surpassed my expectations and I think it did portray the policemen as flawed but quintessentially good and also heroic. I think most people will love it.",1350691200,,2453,4.710280373831775
5124183,4,B008220CQU,"End of Watch is a forgettable title for a film which tries tremendously hard to be something more than it is: namely, a one-dimensional cop-buddy movie. Director David Ayer throws all sorts of modern lo-fi tricks at the screen to hustle up an authentic gritty vibe and achieves it, but then lets himself down with an orthodox and ultimately unambitious screenplay beset with cartoon villainy. The result is still an entertaining couple of hours, supported by strong performances from both leads and the supporting cast.

Set in South Central Los Angeles, officers Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pea) are harness bulls with the LAPD who have a penchant for stumbling into situations beyond their pay grade: while Sarge (Frank Grillo) constantly exhorts them to be out there writing tickets, the boys can't help themselves: an opening sequence shows them pursuing then (justifiably) shooting dead armed offenders, and later, even a casual check in on a missing old lady turns up a huge cocaine shipment, a people smuggling operation and a mass of tortured and murdered immigrants.

Cinema vrit is provided courtesy of a filming style which you'll love or hate: being an aspiring amateur filmmaker, Taylor carries about his person several product-placed Canon handycams and about four ""flip"" recorders, and so we mostly watch early exchanges through his own, and jerky, erratic camera work. When the camera needs to be still to dispatch with plot exposition and character establishment, the director contrives to mounted it on the dash of the boys' Black & White, and is not averse splicing in to aerial shots and other conventional cinematic frames, somewhat giving the lie to the ""found footage"" intent. In any case, after a nauseating ten minute spell at the beginning, the framing does settle down a bit.

Now it is one thing having an aspiring film school police officer toting a camera World's-Scariest-Police-Chases style: it is another for the criminals he's pursuing to do the same thing. Both the not-so-bad African American gang and the baaad Mexican gang are obliged by this filming decision to be also compulsively filming themselves as they go about their gangster business. For a film which takes so many cues in its dialogue and attitude from The Wire, it well and truly missed this one: there's no way Omar or the boy Marlo would be seen dead on handycam; least of all in flagrante delicto shooting up the neighbourhood.

Things trundle on: in candid in in-car conversations we better get to know the boys, who reveal themselves to be good, well-intentioned lads, if crime-prone, and with loving families, and or at least designs on them. And then, without really the dramatic impetus to suggest it, suddenly everything goes wrong. It seems the really, really baaaaaaad dudes down in Mexico are finally sick of these troublesome priests, and resolve through their local agents to do something about it: We have arrived at the final reel. Ayer does not disappoint, although he does then tack on a bizarre coda after the action is complete that I can't fathom, other than as a means of providing a stronger up-beat to the finale.

This is an entertaining but, at its extremities, slightly potty film. Performances from the leads are all strong - Gyllenhaal and Pea are excellent, but cracks are visible in its heavy reliance on style, and weakly scripted villains.
