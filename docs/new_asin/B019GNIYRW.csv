8745127,1,B019GNIYRW,"Unfortunately, this film is based on a falsehood. They promoted the film by saying the Israeli government censored 70% of the contents. The original manuscript and correspondence still exist.
The government was not responsible for this. The original authors of the book chose what they
wanted included. The Israeli government virtually approved it all except 1% to 2%. The deception has been exposed masterfully in the book, ""The War on Error"". The author's speeches are available on YouTube.

This exploitation is just one of hundreds of examples of this kind of propaganda. Truth should be the goal, not fame, cred and money.",1514505600,,627,5.147058823529412
8745128,5,B019GNIYRW,Excellent. A young combat soldiers perspective with their own words coupled with rare archival footage. What some of these 20 kids were worrying about happening 50 years ago in the aftermath of this war came to pass.,1510704000,,216,4.864864864864865
8745129,1,B019GNIYRW,"This movie was made by a self haters that were unable to participate in the 1967 war in the way that the majority of heroic, courageous IDF soldiers  were. I feel sorry for them.",1491523200,,178,4.235294117647059
8745130,3,B019GNIYRW,Informative but rather naive perception of Israel's left on the ugliness of fighting for survival and the cruelty of wars.,1480636800,,122,5.15

8745133,5,B019GNIYRW,A great documentary.  A must see.,1466121600,,33,4.5
8745134,3,B019GNIYRW,"Seemed to be an Anti-war Anti-Israeli look at Israel's wars, from 1948 to Lebanon. Still, the veterans own voices on tape were replayed to them from  wars they fought in decades earlier and unless deceptively edited, they seemed to be okay with the tapes they made immediately after battle {mostly the 1967 war} where they themselves criticized their own conduct of the war as well as that of the Israeli state. Still seemed worth watching to hear the soldiers perspective.",1465689600,3,473,4.9125
8745135,5,B019GNIYRW,An outstanding film documentary of witness. The many soldiers who give testimony here and whose contemporary selves add their voices years later do a fine job of unraveling the myths of 1967 and also reveal that at least a few were painfully aware of the war's atrocities and the toxic nature of occupation. A tremendous achievement.,1463184000,3,333,4.964285714285714
8745136,1,B019GNIYRW,"As someone who is both against the current govt of Israel and against the occupation, I initially began to enjoy this film before coming to the clear realisation that it is a pernicious, insidious, unrelenting assault on the very right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. Hiding behind the undoubtedly true, but highly selective, recordings of the veterans, it peddles a wholly distorted view of the conduct of the war (implying there was massive ethnic cleansing when the biggest refugee camp it alluded to of expelled Palestinians amounted to 7,500 people - compare to Syria!!!) , slaughter of prisoners as policy, and old canards like Israel = the USA's 51st state, when anyone who knows the topic is aware that the USSR recognised the state first and helped supply it with weapons.
A dishonest film also because it trundles out a bunch of disgruntled veterans in 2015 who are not actually the same people whose voices we hear lambasting Israel to its core, whereas when you watch it, you think these are the same people.
I suggest Loushy makes his next film about gardening or yoga (no disrespect to either, but he can't handle such a topic in an ethical way, and I speak as an experienced director with international documentary credits).",1456012800,6,1245,4.822429906542056
