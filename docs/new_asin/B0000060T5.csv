7903560,5,B0000060T5,I am finishing my collection of Jonny Quest dvd and vhs and this was one that I could not have done without. It was sent fast and I have already viewed it several times.,1356998400,,169,4.0
7903561,5,B0000060T5,"I do not usually review VHS releases that are over a decade old, but this really was a nice set. There were only four tapes in the set but they really captured the best of the series. In fact, if you can't afford the full 26 episode DVD release (and you still have a VHS player) these tapes are still an excellent review or introduction to the classic 1964 series. They were digitally remastered so they are bright and sharp to watch with clear, full sound. It's funny, but in some ways they seem more modern, and optimistic, than anything being produced these days. They really predicted an incredible amount of present day technology.

1) Race Bannon in An Army of One includes: Mystery of the Lizard Men, and Double Danger, plus a Space Ghost cartoon (Heat Thing.)

2) Dr. Zin in Master of Evil includes: Riddle of the Gold, and The Robot Spy, plus a Space Ghost cartoon (Creature King.)

3) Hadji in Mysteries of the East includes: Calcutta Adventure, and Pirates from Below, plus a Space Ghost Cartoon (Revenge of the Spider Woman.)

4) Bandit in Adventures Best Friend includes Attack of the Tree People, and Terror Island, plus a Space Ghost Cartoon (Zorak.)",1190246400,4,1165,4.640776699029126
7903562,5,B0000060T5,"This is a must for all Jonny Quest as well as Bandit fans. Bandit is without a doubt the cutest cartoon dog in cartoon history and both these episodes are completely different.
First the dramtic and rather terrifying TERROR ISLAND where the Quest team goes to Hong Kong to investigate sightings of giant mutant monsters.  Definetly for a more mature cartoon audience as a man is shot and killed right in front of our eyes.  Things then go to loveable and cute as ATTACK OF THE TREEPEOPLE is played.  Jonny Hadji and Bandit are lost at see and stranded on an island with a bunch of funny apes and two stereotypical  evil Austrailian hunters Silky and Chopper.
Definetly worth it to very different episodes one cute and one grewsome.  This really shows why this cartoon was so great.  Highly recommended!",984873600,14,802,4.692857142857143
