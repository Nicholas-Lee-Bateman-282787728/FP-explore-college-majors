3712088,5,B001N9VW5Y,"As a big fan of Family Guy, I must say this was a must have for my collection.  I watched it with my boyfriend who is a huge Kiss fan and we were pleasently suprised to see Kiss Saves Christmas integrated into the storyline.  The celebrity appearances are so cool.  And a bonus is the American Dad Christmas special.",1265846400,7,316,4.322033898305085
8323353,4,B001N9VW5Y,"""Family Guy's"" first Christmas episode and ""American Dad's"" Christmas episode also on this DVD tape. The ""Family Guy"" episode packs a punch of eggnog with festivities surrounding the holiday. Peter just wants to watch his favorite Christmas special, ""Kiss Rescues Santa Claus."" Lois just wants a perfect Christmas. Stewie is playing Baby Jesus in the Christmas Nativity Pageant. I am adult who just loves ""Family Guy"" in general.

""American Dad"" has Stan, the family patriarch, defending himself in heaven. Surprisingly, ""American Dad"" episode is entertaining and it's considered a bonus episode on the DVD. Seth McFarlane created both series. The two cartoon Christmas episodes are just fine and entertaining on this DVD.

There are no extra special features.",1482710400,,760,5.432203389830509

8323355,4,B001N9VW5Y,I know many people have said that you can just look through one of the seasons to find this episode.  I like it because when Christmas comes and I'm looking for my Christmas shows I don't have to look...I can just pull out my episode and move on.  I always search for the best deal and if the price isn't right check back you maybe lucky like I was and get a fabulous deal for a great DVD.,1468886400,,389,3.9743589743589745

8323361,5,B001N9VW5Y,"This dvd is great.  However, before you purchase check to see if this episode is included in one of the volumes of ""Family Guy"", since it says on the cover: ""A classic 'Family Guy' episode re-released for the holiday season"".  I did see it on Adult Swim before.

It is too expensive at over $20 if you already have this episode on dvd.  I got mine with a 'Daily Deal' offer and paid about $8.00, with free shipping as a member of Prime.

It has the advantage of being able to keep with your other Xmas dvds, so you don't have to search and search your volumes for it when you may especially want to see it during the holidays.

The episode is probably from 2001.  It is full frame, wonderfully colorful, and a good one.  Peter gives away all their Xmas presents to a Toys for Tots equivalent, and while Brian is home alone the Xmas tree burns down, and the turkey in the oven starts a fire in the kitchen.

Included is a ""never-released on dvd"" episode of a Xmas-themed ""American Dad"".  Again, you should check the volumes you own first to see if you already have it.  It was probably shown in 2007.  It may have since been included in a volume you already have.  I've seen it on tv.

Tho both episodes are delightful, I would not pay the going price for it.  It was worth the price I got it for.  You may want to put this on your Wish List and hope it comes up again on a good sale.

The ""American Dad"" episode is a great one, as Stan goes in search of a Xmas tree in the wild and meets with a fatal accident.  Again, it has the advantage of being to just go to this dvd at holiday time so you can find it conveniently.",1392422400,2,1620,4.1050955414012735
8323362,5,B001N9VW5Y,"a big fan of Family Guy and of course out of all the characters, I like a lot of others really like Stewie.",1384646400,,107,3.6956521739130435
