8265145,5,B00176X774,"I don't understand the other reviewers who complain that this is overpriced. Health is the greatest wealth. This is simple, yet it is thorough. It introduces you to a practice that is perfect for 1) an introduction to qigong, 3) a short and effective follow-me-style daily routine, and 3) routines to reduce stress and injuries, reinvigorate yourself, and gain energy throughout the day. It features exercises from the beginning of her book: Healing yourself with Qigong. So, it's good if you'd like to watch a video to clarify the written descriptions and illustrations.",1520985600,,571,5.150537634408602
8265146,5,B00176X774,"It's clear, well produced and short.  Wish there were more... especially as back up to Suzanne's Heal Yourself with Qigong book.",1358812800,,128,5.095238095238095
8265147,1,B00176X774,"Simple and direct? Skimpy DVD at best.
Honestly- when I checked the reviews for this DVD- Jimbo's was not published yet. While I own Ms Friedman's book as well- and it's very informative, this DVD for the PRICE is a huge disappointment. Please be aware- this DVD plays for a little over 19 mins- it's basically a teaser to what QiGong can do for you.
This is what you get in 19 mins:
1-Cleanse the Qi, 2-Stretch and Support the Sky, 3-Open Heaven and Close the Earth, 4-Ascend and Descend the Qi, 5-Flying Crane Spreads its Wings, 6-Gathering Qi, 7-QiGong Self massage and 8-Acu-Point tapping.

This makes for a great warm up QiGong DVD but not for the price, and I again, I do own her book and had higher expectations out of this DVD.
I would have thought there would have been several different QiGong routines to work through, based on her well written book.

Another reviewer mention the Garripolis, I own 2 of their DVDs as well and for the experience and value, the Garripolis' DVDs are much better options for those who want to practice QiGong- even those who are beginners.

This is certainly not worth $30-so unless you can find this for at the very least, half price, you may be dissappointed.",1283817600,12,1203,4.560185185185185
8265148,1,B00176X774,This DVD is a ripoff!  For $30 all you get is about 20 minutes of a Qi Gong routine so poorly video-graphed that it's hard to tell if the model is a man or a woman.  Nothing else!  This should sell for $10 max.,1283472000,7,210,3.727272727272727
8265149,4,B00176X774,"This is a great product for any beginner. Very appealing concerning both audio and video. The exercises are easy to follow and do. I only wish that there was a bit more information on qigong mechanics and history for the absolute beginner. That's the reason for 4 stars and not 5. Overall, an excellent product.",1263513600,10,311,4.672727272727273
8265150,5,B00176X774,"I've tried several videos to learn basic Qi Gong; including Ken Cohen, Michael Winn, the Garripolis, and some others, but all of them were either too complex or too long, poorly produced, or so boring I couldn't get through them. Susan Friedman has created a set of simple and direct Qi Gong exercises that I could learn quickly and actually do. The video gets directly to the routine without any preliminary explanations. The exercises are easily followed and can be completed in about 15-20 minutes. It might be helpful to have some previous knowledge of Qi Gong, and I do have that, but it isn't essential. The only other Qi Gong video that comes even close to this one in clarity and accessibility is Eight Simple Qigong Exercises For Health - The Eight (8) Pieces of Brocade, done by Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming. My next purchase will be Friedman's book Heal Yourself With Qigong: Gentle Practices to Increase Energy, Restore Health, and Relax the Mind.",1251936000,31,950,4.798780487804878
