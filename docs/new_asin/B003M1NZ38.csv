8491226,5,B003M1NZ38,"Are you kidding me?  The lines these guys take will make you take your shorts off.  The disciple that these guys abide by will make you... take your shorts off.  Amazing scenery mixed with incredible riding.  The sponsors should be pleased, these guys' riding would sell binoculars to a blind man.",1353456000,,297,4.764705882352941
8491227,4,B003M1NZ38,The video is simply amazing. I have never seen so much effort to produce such great cinematography for a mountain biking video.,1305331200,,127,4.818181818181818
8491228,5,B003M1NZ38,"OK, I'll dispense with the kid slang.
This film is so well done, I keep going back to it and watching every few weeks or so.
There is so much great riding in it - this must be what Bruce Lee kung fu movies are like for martial arts lovers. Eye candy and learning at the same time.
Everything is great - cinematography, music tracks, the talent.
I only wish it were 30 minutes longer.
Just buy it already and support these filmmakers. I bought the DVD at my local bike shop, because I like supporting them.
This review applies to the standard def. DVD.",1303776000,,551,4.257142857142857
8491229,5,B003M1NZ38,"never seen such spectacular footages of mountain biking before.  The sounds are fantastic too.  I'll be watching this over and over.  Inspirational for me as I'm working to improve my skills...too late to do any of the insane stunts that these younger guys do, but they looked like that were having such a blast.",1300752000,,312,4.7407407407407405
8491230,5,B003M1NZ38,"ALong the same style as the collective, seasons. Well angle footage of freeride/black diamond and downhill guys performing great tricks, jumps and hucks. Follows differing locations globally From Whistler to New Zealand and good supporting music to make the segments flow. You get a feel again of those who love mountain bikes and the extremes many pursue in the quest for the ultimate ride! A must have for any mtb riders collections.",1293753600,,435,5.055555555555555
8491231,5,B003M1NZ38,"I've watched it 4 times now and am still amazed.  this video captures what the best riders like to do when they ride for fun, and it shows.  some trails are clearly 'pros only' whereas others are ones I'd like to ride, and it's fun to see world class riders on both.  Based on this video the Pipe Dream trail at Silver Star resort in BC is now on my list of trails to ride before i die.  so is New Zealand (Queenstown segment).  My previous favorite MTB video was Kranked 8 Revolve, but now i'm no longer sure.  This video is awesome.  The vibe is awesome and the riding is top notch.  I highly recommend this video to any mtb rider - go buy it now, and then go ride.",1286928000,,667,4.038167938931298
8491232,5,B003M1NZ38,"All I have to say is wow!  The anthill (basically collective) crew has done it again.  Probably the best MTB video I've ever seen, and i've seen them all.

The Sam Hill North Shore riding is mind blowing.  The final ride in New Zealand is the type of trail you can only dream of.

This video features the best riders in the world riding the most amazing trails you've ever seen.  Perfect mixture of amazing trails and ridiculous hits and drops.

This video sets a new high bar for videos to come.",1276214400,6,496,4.326086956521739
