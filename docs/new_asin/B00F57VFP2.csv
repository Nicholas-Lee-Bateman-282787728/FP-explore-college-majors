8612394,1,B00F57VFP2,"So I bought this for my 16 month old son. He watches a baby channel where he only hears English, so I hoped this DVD would be something where he would see animated children speaking Igbo and start hearing more Igbo.  Unfortunately, there is not much he can learn from this.  The beginning is just writing on the screen where they talk about ndi Igbo going overseas and eventually losing their culture and now trying to get it back for their children.  Then they show the animated girls dancing across the screen. Next they show maybe 10-15 animals and you hear the girls identify the animals in Igbo. Then they show the same animals with the parents' voices identifying the animals and their daughters repeating them. Then they show it again with no audio so that the audience (the parents and children) will identify the animals. The audio quality is poor, and the whole DVD was poorly done. I could easily show my son pictures of animals and teach him the names in Igbo instead of spending money on what is essentially a 10 minute lesson on a few animals.  And they also promote their other DVDs in the beginning of this video, and from the title covers, my guess is that it is the same thing but with different animals or insects.  The actual lesson time is quite short, and I think they only space out the lessons in individual DVDs to make more money. This DVD would be ten times better if they used the animated characters in an actual storyline or adventures, like the children going to the zoo and talking about the animals in sentences to each other or with their parents. I would not buy this again and actually want my money back for this one.  Will have to keep using Youtube until someone makes a better and more thoughtful product.",1401494400,3,1745,4.506329113924051
8612395,5,B00F57VFP2,This product is not for adults. It is for toddlers who are just beginning to learn the first elements of language. It is the first in a series of four with an additional workbook. It is a companion video for the volume one in this series. It is specifically designed with total immersion and aimed at focusing the learner for limited amounts of time with just enough of the right material.,1310515200,,389,4.492957746478873
8612396,2,B00F57VFP2,It is an amateur video of very poor quality (picture and sound) with all but a few words like animal or fruit names. Not suitable for any one to learn basics in a language.,1303171200,,172,4.088235294117647
