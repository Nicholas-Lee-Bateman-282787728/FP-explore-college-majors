8723999,5,B000N3AW4S,"This 2 episode OVA falls under the stats of excellent! The hentai takes place in a post-apocalyptic point in time where humanity was almost wiped out, those who had survived start a project to help earth. The story follows a girl with almost no memory called ""el"" who is a sniper. During her journey she meets an idol named Parsley who was almost sexually harassed. Parsley stays with ""el"" not to be protected, but to be with her forever. Time to time as the story progresses ""el"" starts having some kind of flashback, but it starts to piece together if you watch till the end. This is a yuri hentai (girls in love with other girls) so if this doesn't suit you look elsewhere.
