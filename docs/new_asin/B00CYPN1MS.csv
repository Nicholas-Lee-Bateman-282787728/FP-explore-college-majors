8587585,5,B00CYPN1MS,I just got this today and I absolutely love it. I love burlesque ancient and this just makes working out way more fun,1524614400,,117,4.130434782608695
8587586,5,B00CYPN1MS,Now this is a fun workout! I do Zumba and I use my Fluidity Barre and adding this to my weekly work out just completes me for the week.,1425254400,,135,3.689655172413793
8587587,4,B00CYPN1MS,"as the title said i bought both and like them both. true some moves are similar on both dvds and i think they could have combined the two for one really great dvd. but they didn't and im not disappointed anyway. i like the moves both girls have their own personality and i like both. did notice minor editing problems. they show you a move that isn't done till the next section in a demo section. not to big a deal just leaves you wondering when youll do it. but when you do the move you have already learned it so no real problems
**Update**
Just did this workout this morning. i love it love it! it really starts slowly and its a gentle workout. im wasing back in to working out. and im not wide eyed as soon as i way up. the warm up gave me time to wake up and get properly heated up. wonderful way to wake up shaking your butt. good way to remember there is a vixen deep inside even though youll be boring old momma again as soon as the little ones wake up. :) definetly recommend this one",1410134400,,993,4.071428571428571
8587588,5,B00CYPN1MS,"This is a fun and great workout! They talk a little too much for me, but are very descriptive. If you like burlesque, you'll love this video. Please note that the other one like this ""Rock Bottom"" is the same. They both have mostly the same moves and routines. So buy one, not both! I have both and feel as if I was cheated.",1400716800,3,324,4.078125
8587589,4,B00CYPN1MS,Good video.as most of them are from Best Assets. Lot of fun and worth acquiring to get yourself fit in a fun way.,1394755200,,113,3.9565217391304346
8587590,1,B00CYPN1MS,"The video was a total waste of money.  I was interested in a professional presentation of the elements of burlesque and how to put them together in a routine.  I wasn't interested in the stretching or yoga type of movements, if I were, I would have purchased a yoga/stretch video.  It was just a lot of ""mugging"" for the camera.  I wish I could get my money back.",1392422400,,363,4.294117647058823
8587591,4,B00CYPN1MS,"This was a great, sexy workout taught by two very beautiful ladies!! I had a fun time working up a sweat and pretending I was a burlesque dancer. The instructors are very good and so pretty! The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because I didn't feel the workout was vigorous enough. This probably works best for someone who is just beginning a workout regimen. I definitely am happy I got this though. I will probably use it to unwind at the end of the day or on days I don't feel like working out too hard!!! Glad I purchased this and I recommend it! Lots of fun!",1391299200,3,580,4.1415929203539825
8587592,4,B00CYPN1MS,"I purchased both Rock Bottom & Best Assets. And I thought both were good. The production is great. And Gal Friday &
Peekaboo Pointe are fun to workout with. There is some overlap on the moves (one section of moves are repeated on both Dvds-Butt Isolations-Stripper Push-Ups-Down Dog Shimmy)

The actual moves taught on each DVD isn't alot-only seven different moves on each (and some of those are only a variation on another). They are broken down into three 10 minute mini workouts or one continuous 30 minute workout. I think they could have combined the material from both Dvds and made just one great dvd- but that's my opinion.

There is a section on Toning & Sculpting-with PeekaBoo Pointe leads you through a few Pilates type exercises for the legs & abs. The leg toning is a killer, my muscles were feeling the burn during & afterwards.

(Rock Bottom's -Toning & Sculpting- has a couple of varitaions on squats: a basic squat-squats while clenching your buttom-squats-alternating with releve on the toes, etc.)

This does work your body out. And though they may look easy at first glance, some of the moves can be challenging. I think overall, this workout would be fun to do to break-up the regular workout routine and work different parts of my body in a new way. I will say I am in moderate physical condition and I broke a good sweat. The music has a fun retro feel-like the old instrumental surfer music. This DVD is a nice alternative to the normal workout routine.

FYI: there is no Cool-down & alot of moves are done on the floor.

8587593,5,B00CYPN1MS,Most fun working out ever! Worked up more of a sweat than Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30. Way more fun!,1386806400,2,102,4.15
8587594,5,B00CYPN1MS,"Best Assests is another great video from the series of "" Burlesque Booty workout"" presented by the lovely team, PeekaBoo Pointe and Gal Friday, in beautiful, rich theater setting.
I had a blast working out to this video. Every section is full of luscious movements that are so in for today's dances. I knew initially I would like to learn every bit of material from these.
Having worked previously with ""Rock Bottom Booty Workout"" I know to use the warm up section in order to prepare for the challenging moves ahead. These programs have a fantastic stretch and warm up section very helpful in achieving the movement. To begin, the warm-up works the upper and lower body using rotations, such as rib circles, hip and torso rotations, deep shoulder rolls.
The Burlesque movement sections
Section one:  Learning the chest shimmy, pelvic thrusts and rotations that develop into the bump and grind, Shimmy pop, (upper body), wiggle pop,(lower body)
Workout one
This section takes all the above upper and lower body movement into a workout that repeats the movements into larger range of motion in the shoulders and arms, large rib circles, hip shimmies with a pop. Very cute movement and a nice workout!
Burlesque moves 2
This is full of fun and delightful moves that are just a bit more challenging but so exciting and fun to learn.  This is my favorite section, as I love anything challenging. These are the movements included:
The pendulum is cute a loose booty shake on straight knees; looks easy yet requires some practice in order to master like these girls.
Next up is the hip dip, a sensual move requiring knee action much like a figure 8 with the hips), also referred to here as the ""Axle Rose"".
The most challenging move in this section is the body wave. This is definitely not a beginner move, I recommend practicing some camel poses in yoga, in order to strengthen the abdominal muscles and the upper back for this intense floor move. It is beautiful and sensual to watch.
Workout 2
Putting all the above movement into a slinky, sexy, mini choreography with also includes very sensual movement on the floor. This is section is a terrific workout for the entire body.

Burlesque moves 3
The following movements take place on the floor. The movement is very sensual and slightly difficult to maneuver. Learn to isolate the buttocks with a squeeze and release motion in the gluts, the challenging stripper push-up which is very seductive, and beautiful. The next movement is my absolute favorite, called the down dog shimmy, and I am glad I practice yoga as it came in very handy for these moves.
Workout 3 continues with very intense floor work and requires padding the knees or using a yoga mat. This section blends more stripper pushups, the down dog shimmy, butt isolations, and more challenging moves.
The workout sections are approximately ten minutes long, An added bonus is the fabulous sculpting and toning section for abdominals and legs, (workout on the floor), which is intense and can be felt for days!
 I imagine continuous practice will help develop isolations as perfectly as these two lovelies, but for me, it's a work in progress. Nonetheless, this workout is fabulous and fun and I am happy to be investing in my assets!",1382745600,10,3244,4.808243727598566
