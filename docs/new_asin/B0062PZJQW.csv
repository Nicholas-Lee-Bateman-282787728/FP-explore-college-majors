4933713,4,B0062PZJQW,"After a few years of not seeing a new J-horror film it was nice to see this release.  Synapse did a great job with the DVD, as usual.  The picture quality is quite good on this anamorphic widescreen DVD.
The film isn't as scary as a lot of j-horror, but there are a couple of jump scares, the characters are interesting, the film moves along at a brisk pace, and the the entire cast is pretty :) .  Parts of it make you wonder if it's a dream or a ghost or what, and part of this feel is what helps the viewer ask questions while watching it...you're not quite sure what's real.  Anyway, I liked it for what it was.  Don't expect edge-of-your-seat scariness, but a decent time-passer that should give you a couple of jumps along with an entertaining story.",1326412800,9,756,4.295774647887324

4933719,3,B0062PZJQW,"Japanese guy writing this...

It's an OK Japanese thriller. It is not a horror movie nor a cheap T&A movie.

The story is about a half dozen college students and a teacher/professor going to a remote lodge in the hills during the off season (not explained in English). Two of them want to make a movie. One wants to be a star and has two entourages. The Entourages called their leader ""Sempai"" (again, not explained in English, the dynamic of how that worked. The teacher brings along one of the movie maker's sister. No clear explanation is given why the younger sister has to tag along except for rumors of the sister and teacher being gay (no, there aren't any lesbian scenes). Why that was thrown in, I have no idea and it is not germain to the story. And of course, at the lodge 7 years ago, there were murders and the teacher was there...etc. I won't go any more but it gives you a taste of what the story is about.

The Good is that it stays true to the story. No sudden addition of characters ala ""Scooby-Doo"" or other cartoonish thriller/horror movies. The story is good but not polished. Perhaps a couple of re-writes would have made this movie into a four star category.

The Bad. It loses at least one star due to the translation. Words like ""Sempai"" and ""Sensei"" are not translated but turned into English by either ignoring the word or using ""Mrs."" instead. I'll let you look up the words. Acting is good but unfortunately it sounds like they are reading a script but that may be due them speaking Japanese which often sounds like mono-tone. Why? There are some words in Japanese that when you say the word, you must give or take away emphasis to mean what you meant. In this movie, the translator did not use the words but what they meant within the movie, hence, you lose some of the dialogue. Why this was important is that because since I know enough Japanese, I was able to figure out who was who and their motivations.

Don't get me wrong. You can ""read"" this movie without knowing one Japanese word and you may enjoy it better that I did because of that but I know enough Japanese to know that the translation is off.",1427068800,7,2138,4.416243654822335

4933721,5,B0062PZJQW,"Cheesy, slasher flik. Just Japanese. Rumors of crazed killings at a site in the woods. Followed by slasher style cinema. It is what you would expect.

4933722,2,B0062PZJQW,"This is considered ""Asian Cult"" but I found it lacking as a good cult film. A bunch of girls revive the ""movie club"" and travel to a remote location to make a film. It just so happens this is the same location the last movie club went to before weird things happened. There is an 8mm film of a killing that seems to have some kind of effect on people...or not.

The girls start snooping around trying to figure out what happened when things start to happen to them.

This is Japanese horror that seems to lack horror. The acting didn't seem that good...hard to tell when you are reading subtitles. The girls watching the film had that ""Ring"" feel to it, but that was about it. Better Asian cult horror out there.

4933723,3,B0062PZJQW,"First off, I would like to say that this was a good film in theory. It doesn't follow the general J-Horror patterns of storytelling that we've become so used to over the last several years. Add to that the addition of a mystery plot along the way and you end up with something quite different.

In the film, a group of female college students travel deep into a forest where they plan to do some filming for their newly formed movie club. Apparently the club existed seven years ago, but was disbanded when one of the members went crazy on a shoot and murdered another club member. In fact, it seems the murder was recorded on an 8 mm camera when it occurred, but when the girls see it, they believe it's only movie theatrics they're viewing, not a real murder.

The movie takes some interesting twists and turns until the film reaches its conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well Gorozuka had a good concept in general. I liked the ""who done it element"" joined by the possibility that a real spirit was at work in the forest. There were definitely  some genuine moments where I jumped, and the movie kept me guessing for a while.

However, the film does suffer due to some mediocre acting. The girls never seemed scared enough to me, considering the situation they were in. Also, the conflicts between the girls should have had a lot more attention given to them. It was apparent to me that there were some deep rooted resentments in the group, but the film only gives us bits and pieces about those resentments. Delving into them further might have helped the viewer feel more sympathy for the characters once they ran into trouble. Instead, the movie turns into a ""who done it"" story part of the time, while attempting to make several of the girls look guilty. The film does give hope however, that an evil spirit is at work.

The only other distraction in the film I found was the horror soundtrack, which wasn't bad in and of itself. However, there were times where it suddenly cut out after a tense scene without any type of transition. It seemed like it was being used as a creative music style by the director, but it didn't work for me. It just came across like bad editing.

Anyway, the tech aspects of the DVD include the film in Japanese only with English subtitles, along with a short ""making of the film"" feature.

In the end I gave the film three stars. I liked the use of a Shinto based play along with a creepy Noh masked character running around terrorizing the girls. It seemed like a fresh idea. The addition of a mysterious 8 mm video from the past also helped create a creepy atmosphere. The loss of 2 stars would be due to the acting in general, which was poor in some cases, and the lack of stronger character building. The two leads get a lot of screen time, but it's not enough to really know what's going on within the group. It's like the viewer is thrown into a bad situation with the girls and has to do a lot of deciphering to figure out what's going on between them.

In conclusion, Gurozuka is an OK rental at best, but probably not a keeper for most. It does however, bring to mind the idea of, Be careful little eyes what you see.",1385856000,2,3168,4.401709401709402
8491376,5,B0062PZJQW,"to be honest this is the scariest J-horror film i've seen for a while. the murderer is terrifying with the Noh mask and even more frightening with blood on the face. leave it to the Japanese to make a horror film that is definitely worthy of a rewatch...like over and over again.
thumbs up right up in the air

8491377,3,B0062PZJQW,The film was just o.k.  I have seen a lot of Asian horror films and this one is at the bottom of the list.
