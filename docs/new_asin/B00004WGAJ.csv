1364538,5,B00004WGAJ,"This mini-series is based on the autobiography of famed naturalist Gerald Durrell and centers on his childhood years on the Mediterranean island of Corfu.  It is filled with his impressions as a boy of his very eccentric family, the Greek friends including the immortal Spiro and Dr. Stephanides, and the flora and fauna of the island.

I thoroughly recommend it as a clean, entertaining, hilarious and poignant family movie.",1175040000,3,425,5.144927536231884
1364539,5,B00004WGAJ,"This dramatization of Gerald Durrell's classic memoir of a 10 year old English boy's transplantation to the Greek island of  Corfu, and the domestic comedy of manners which follows as his family acclimatizes, is thoroughly enjoyable and completely different from American family fare which relies on crime and violence, car chases and the threat of violence for its comedy and dramatic suspense. This film displays a refreshing alternate sensibility which relies instead on the intrinsic interest of place, of a boy's developing love for nature, and for the unfolding of human foibles in a terrific, quixotic environment.",1041638400,14,621,5.402061855670103
7925255,3,B00004WGAJ,"I loved this series when it was on TV and was looking forward to watching it.  It is very charming and they partnered with the natural history unit so there is a lot of focus on the insects and animals rather than the people.  The problem with the discs is both the cover and the first disc advertise that they contain six episodes but there are only 4 episodes on disc one.  Two are missing.  The disc menu has four episodes when played and the disc stops after four episodes, so two are missing.  Very annoying.",1511913600,,513,4.302083333333333
7925256,2,B00004WGAJ,"I had previously purchased the Masterpiece Theatre/WGBH-Boston 90 min DVD finding the story and acting to be charming though the film quality was not first rate and the story time too short. Unfortunately, this 10 part BBC made for television series has beautiful filming but the story is dull, character development poor and the program marred by a repetitively played whistled theme song. I thought that this 250 minute version would have an expanded story line but it actually seems to have less. The extra time seems to be filled with stock film clips of various animals appearing with out commentary and then at the beginning, ending and at times supposedly expressing a carefree moment the annoying whistled theme song is played.",1483401600,4,735,5.032786885245901

7925260,1,B00004WGAJ,"Since you asked...
  The disk arrived in good order from the UK.  It was meant to be a Valentine gift for my wife, who is a huge fan of author Gerald Durrell.  However, the disks turned out to be only usable for DVD players in ""Region 2.""  The U.S. is, alas, ""Region 1.""  It cost me $9.45 to return it and left me short a Valentine gift.  I was disappointed, and a little miffed.",1425686400,4,379,4.04054054054054

throughout.",1403913600,,110,3.782608695652174
7925262,3,B00004WGAJ,"If only they had used the cast from the Masterpiece Theater version.  The story carries the show but the cast just doesn't seem very interested.  Rather sad, really.",1383350400,,165,4.857142857142857
7925263,3,B00004WGAJ,"I'm almost positive that the listing for this item did NOT mention that it was in European DVD format, therefore unwatchable on most basic US devices. Sigh. I probably should have known better since I've been looking for this movie forever, but ... however, I've put it on the shelf and will find a way ...! This production of this delightful story is far superior to the later production more readily available on DVD.",1365120000,7,419,4.675675675675675
