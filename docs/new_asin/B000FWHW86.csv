2593032,2,B000FWHW86,"Saw this DVD collection at work today, and was excited for about a minute, before I finally discovered that ""Child's Play"" -- THE ORIGINAL FILM OF THE SERIES (!!!) -- is not included. Of course, there have got to be reasons accountable for such a strange omission, but whatever the case might be, I think it's pretty absurd to sell a 'Chucky' collection without the first freakin' film that started the whole thing. It's lack of a presence was enough for me to put the DVD back where it came from.

And here's the thing... I grew up on the 'Child's Play' films, and Brad Dourif's vocal performance as Chucky haunted me with more anxiety than, in all honesty, any other film I saw at a young age. For that reason alone, the series holds one of the nostalgic compartments within my heart. So, here's my personal thought process:

I see the 'Child's Play' ""series"" as the first three films created, and those three films only. Why? Because the three are all, by and large, consistent in character and ambience; in short, they are all horror films. They were also born within but a year or two from each other, and it's obvious a certain mentality and approach was attempted to be held by each subsequent crew of filmmakers. 'Bride of Chucky', released a good eight or so years after 'Child's Play 3', was pretty fun, and not without its own little sense of wit, but it's whole attitude of self-mockery and tongue-in-cheek flavor just left a sour taste in my mouth. Not that the result itself was poor, but I think such a reaction arose out of seeing a horror icon within the depths of my psyche turn into a comedic punching bag. Sure, Dourif shines as always voicing Mr. Crazy Doll, but the whole thing was, as anyone would agree, ridiculous, even out of sheer intention. Then, devastatingly, 'Seed of Chucky' decided to come into being but a few years ago. To me, 'Seed' is on so many levels an unmitigated abomination, and surely -- so surely -- the weakest, most dreadful entity in the saga. What I'm trying to summarize is that, ideally, I don't even want 'Bride' or 'Seed' in my film collection. 'Bride' is awesome in many respects and totally successful at what it yearns to be, but I don't consider it a 'Child's Play' film, simply an extension of a horror series which rebelliously reveled in its own unique sense of humor and personality. 'Seed' is just bad. More convincing an argument, though, is that looking objectively one comes to the same conclusion: the first three films are, at their core, straight-forward horror films working on a premise; everything after that is just eccentric baggage running its own course.

I probably don't even deserve to be writing a review of this box-set, because not only do I not own it, I don't own any of the individual dvds themselves. I did catch the third on some premium channel a few months ago, though, and I rented the first to show a friend of mine who'd never even heard about the infamous Chucky (I don't know how either..), so basically they're still pretty fresh in my noggin.  I just felt the desire to write a bit here because, there I was, ready to purchase the set in my hands without a second thought.  After being perplexed with the realiziation of the first film's absence, however, I just sort of walked around in mild frustration for a few minutes, thinking over and over in my head -- 'what a stupid @%#@#%^ set'.",1160870400,4,3384,4.577557755775578
2593033,4,B000FWHW86,"If your like me and grew up watching horror movies, then CHUCKY has to come to mind.  I saw this at a local Wal-Mart for around $20 I was like WOW, I must have it.

2593034,4,B000FWHW86,"This Chucky Killer Collection contains 4 films on 2 flip discs from the Chucky/Child's Play series. Disc 1 side A contains ""Child's Play 2"", side B contains ""Child's Play 3"". Disc 2 side A contains ""Bride of Chucky"", side B contains ""Seed of Chucky"". All the bonus features are on ""Seed"" and ""Bride"" meaning there are no special features for part 2 & 3. If you want the UNRATED VERSION of ""Seed of Chucky"" you will have to purchase it elsewhere, this collection contains all R rated versions. Also Child's Play 1 isn't in this collection.. this is a ""Universal Pictures"" collection and the original Child's Play wasn't released by them. Plain and simple ""the reason why it's not included"".. all and all this is a nice little collection, my advice is to just buy the first movie seperately if you don't have it already but, for sure pick this up!

2593190,3,B000FWHW86,"I purchased the Killer DVD collection, as well as the original Child's Play (20th Anniversary Edition.) I watched them in order... I haven't watched Chucky since I was probably 7, and Child's Play still got my heart racing. It was just as creepy as I remember.

I had watched Child's Play 2 + 3 throughout the span of my years, but never got around to Bride of Chucky or Seed of Chucky. After each movie the storyline became repetitive and boring, however I stuck through it because when I think of terror movies I think of the red headed Good Guy doll.

I just finished watching both Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky... wow, have things gone downhill. My original thought: I am getting old. It certainly wasn't the movies that I was use to, but still somewhat entertaining. This is only because I enjoyed seeing Katherine Heigl in her early years of acting. If I had to pick a favorite of the two I would say Bride, but that is only because I got brief glimpses of the Chucky I once knew. For some reason, even if she is a horrible actress, Jennifer Tilly is still entertaining. The Seed was just a last ditch effort to cash in on the Chucky empire... a very poor attempt.

With all that I said, I will still recommend purchasing the Killer DVD collection, but only to fans that grew up watching the ultimate doll murderer.",1310342400,,1326,4.426229508196721

2593194,3,B000FWHW86,"Starting from the first movie I have to say that it was ok and it became a hit because of the innovation with an evil doll plus the voice of the great Brad Dourif and very dark humor of it. Very 80's movie. The sequel was an improvement of effects and it was ok to see litle Andy evolved as a character. Part three I have to say it was very entertaining. Andy grown up and it's trying to open a way to keep going with his life without falling into madness as long Chucky it's behind all his bad fortune since he was a litle boy.
Bride of Chucky, sorry but it's one of my favourites, the humor, effects, Ronny Yu as a director, beautiful Katherine Heigl, Shocking and unique Jeniffer Tilly (She gets the whole attention)The most evil horror duet for movies, Loved it!
Seed of Chucky was a decepointment as the story lost credibility and it waste too much energy in bad humor, bad acting, bad storyline. Too ridiculous, get back evil Chucky on his feet as Wes Craven made with Freddy on New Nightmare! Long Live to 80's Movies!!!",1257120000,,1027,4.3264248704663215

The first Chucky film, the original ""Child's Play"", is not part of this set as it was made by a different studio. That film, however, is now available in its own new ""20th Anniversary Collector's Edition"" DVD and is packed with bonuses and for the first time it comes in widescreen. This set features all the follow-up Chucky films, presented in widescreen. Both ""Child's Play 2"" and ""Child's Play 3"" are short on bonuses, but ""The Bride of Chucky"" and ""The Seed of Chucky"" contain many extras including commentary and interviews. The biggest film in the set is ""The Bride of Chucky"" that hit #1 at the boxoffice and is widely regarded as the best Chucky film out there next to the original. Jennifer Tilly, who plays Chucky's girlfriend, steals the film with her voice and campy performance. The set is enclosed in a plastic sleeve and the discs are stored in a book that opens with a disc on each side. The dics are double layered so you have a movie on side A and one on side B.

In the childs play movies Chucky is trying to capture Andy so he can swap his soul into his body since Andy knows his secret and chucky has to kill any one who gets in his way. The Bride and The Seed of Chucky is about him and his demented doll wife tiffany and eventually his sunken eyed creepy son Glen which involve the same vodoo killings and crude hummor. The Childs play movies are rated R for their violence and language and the Bride and Seed of Chucky are rated R for Violence, Adult situations, and crude humor so parents should be warned if they let their children watch these movies.

But actually it is a pop up picture, so it looks like Chucky's about ready to jump out and get you.
  Always the first 2 movies will always be the best in the chucky series. But still they manage to suprise you sometimes. Child's Play 1 and 2 were the best. The 3rd I did not like at all, there was no story line, and I found it boring. Then the Bride Of Chucky took it right back to the top again. Then unfortunatly The Seed Of Chucky took it right back down again. I probably disliked this movie the most. there was absolutly no good story line and actually it confused me.
