8535527,1,B0039LMDK2,"I've been to the Beautiful island of the Dominican Republic over 30 times and never in all my days have I seen it represented so poorly and uncreatively.  This ""video"" is pure garbage and that's putting it mildly. What you will see is a smart phone type video (poor sound quality) of two self righteous guys walking through the colonial zone district of Santo Domingo just talking to each other. they visit a church and they begin talking about some stained glass detail that cant even be seen on the screen.  They  film with all the vision and creativity of a blind 4 year old caveperson. There is nothing else offered in regard to history, beaches, fun, women, locations or night life. i don't even know how this ""too poor for youtube"" video ever made it to amazon.  There is nothing in this video for anyone. please don't waste your money. I spent only two dollars and i feel like I was ripped off. The guys who made this should pay me for a free trip to DR so that I can film what the wonderful country is really like. Good lord its a poor video.",1315267200,,1050,4.341836734693878
8535528,1,B0039LMDK2,"Basically 32 minutes of shaky hand-held camcorder footage from two tourists. It provides no context or narration beyond the uninformed chatter between the two dudes filming it. No history lessons, no travel tips, no useful explanation of where they are or what they are looking at, no ""adventures"" and no fun. It starts with footage of somebody juggling in a bar. Then, walking around in a church, and then walking down a street where they don't go into any businesses or talk to any locals. Then there is a couple of minutes at a beach, and a couple more in a mall. Cut to the guy juggling again, roll credits. I want my money and my time back.",1272067200,,645,4.47457627118644
8535529,1,B0039LMDK2,WORST HOME MOVIE EVER !!!!! Not worth even 1 dollar. Very jigglely picture-needs tripod. This should not be for sale by Amazon it is so bad. Amazon should review products before allowing items to be sold on site. What a complete joke !!!! There were no girls shown on this dvd either !!! It spent 20 minutes inside some church where they were joking around and swearing a blue streak. This was a complete disgusting mess. I wonder how much money they plan to make for themselves on this dvd?????,1267660800,2,495,4.511111111111111
