7289082,5,B00ZR3W45O,"As with all the Barbie titles, this movie has a very positive message, catchy music, and an uplifting story line. My 6-year-old loves it and enjoys singing along with the music. We have been disappointed with the values and language of other ""name brand"" movies aimed at this age group, but the Barbie series consistently delivers solid values and quality.",1440979200,12,356,4.95

7289086,3,B00ZR3W45O,"In the dark, grim dystopian world of Rock'N Royals the American Revolution failed and instead of the democratic United States, North America is divided among dozens of feuding royal families.  Commoners are kept in check by the classic formula of bread and circuses with highly-trained pop stars keeping them entertained as the royal parasites drain the wealth of the people.

Against this back drop of velvet gloves and iron fists we meet Princess Courtney and Popstar Erika.  Courtney, along with other pampered royal scions is bound for Camp Royalty for further training and seasoning before she is married off to cement a political alliance, while Erika is bound for Camp Pop in the hopes her music can continue to sedate the populace for a few more years.  However a computer error sends the princess to camp with the propagandists and the rock star to camp with the royal heirs.  And hilarity ensues.  Courtney learns that commoners have feelings too.  And Erika learns that Princesses have access to unicorns and magic which are wisely concealed from the plebeians.  Can a Princess learn to write songs?  Can a mere pop star socialize with royalty?  And what about the big sing off between the two camps?  Or will the peasants revolt and finally end this charade?

OK, OK, sorry.  These princess videos bring out the Marxist in me.  I mean really, what is with all these modern day kingdoms where Barbie is a magical princess?  And how are there enough of them to fill a whole summer camp?  Can't little girls relate to anyone normal?

The repulsive love of royalty aside this is an OK video, there's no lessons here (other than you can be happy whether you are a royal princess or merely a talented, wealthy and famous pop star), no real conflicts to resolve and everything ends with a joint concert with some passable music.

Our girls (age 4) love it of course, and parents can stand it.  So it's not that bad a buy.",1502064000,,1926,4.712574850299402

7289236,1,B00ZR3W45O,"This is probably one of the most annoying of all the Barbie movies my kids like to watch. While I will grudgingly admit that some of the movies aren't too bad, I can find no redeeming qualities with this one. I didn't find the characters to be likeable. They were largely self-centered and caught up in themselves. Add to that a plotline which was embarrassingly predictable and cheesy, and I could hardly recommend this movie.

All that being said, my kids (5 and 9) both adore this movie. My daughter thinks that these are ""the best songs ever,"" which, honestly, may be part of the reason that I dislike the movie so. It's not just the story that's bad, but the music is too. Unfortunately, I'm sure that I'll be re-watching again and again.

7289449,5,B00ZR3W45O,"Barbie adds another great installment to her collection with Rock n Royals. As always, Barbie comes through with a fun, upbeat story...with just a few challenges to overcome as she and opposite number Erika are mistakenly placed in the wrong summer camps (one for Royals, one for Pop). Interestingly, the characters you would expect to be the bad guys of the movie (like some of the snooty cliques from each camp) aren't the real problem here, it's the leaders of the camps themselves, the ones you'd normally expect to be the keepers of the peace. Here, the two opposing camp leaders, as it turns out, have a history culminating in their present rivalry, and Barbie and her new friends have to 'band together' to bring about a truce and reunite the opposing leaders.
Each camp, 'Royals' and 'Pop' are very cool places with lots of great characters. Both Barbie (as Princess Courtney) and popstar Erika have a few adjustments to make in their opposing camps but find they aren't so different after all and much can be appreciated in their diverse lifestyles. There are a few instances where it seems the Pop camp is depicted a little more favorably in the thinking that it's cooler and therefore better, with the Royals (sometimes) being portrayed as a little on the stuffy side. But even this is very subtle and, in all fairness, shows there's something to be said for both. When the leader of the Pop camp contends that his camp at least promotes/teaches a useful skill (music), as opposed to the Royals' camp, which 'merely' teaches royal etiquette, it seems like a misstep. Behaving with elegance, class and maturity is probably the most important skill one can have, especially these days, and is often trampled under the feet of everyone stampeding to be the coolest one in the herd. But still, take these criticisms in the proper context, to the movie's credit, both sides are well-considered and portrayed.
As for the songs, they are catchy and upbeat, and the singing, well, let's say the pop interpretations of the songs are cliched and over-stylized, showing that, while the Royals' a capella singers are portrayed as rote, there is a middle ground. Happily this middle ground is found in the finale when the Royals and the Rockers from both camps join together and combine their talents in concert to make peace (and good music) despite their rival leaders.
Obviously, from the five-star rating I've given here, I highly recommend this movie. It's really put together nicely with some very funny touches and characterizations. It's infinitely re-watchable and I for one intend to do so often. I recommend the same for everyone, this movie is a keeper!",1441843200,9,2663,4.86784140969163

7289477,5,B00ZR3W45O,"Rock 'N Royals is a different direction from previous offerings from Barbie Entertainment due to it's unique musical format, where characters often break into choreographed musical numbers. The plot centers around two warring summer camps (one for princesses and one for rock stars). Barbie's character, the princess, accidentally switches places with one of the rockers. During their time at the other camps, the characters learn to appreciate and learn from the talents and strengths of others. Some of the plot seems like a retread of past films. Barbie's character Courtney is on her way to a princess training camp, similar to 2011's ""Barbie: Princess Charm School."" Also in the film, Barbie's princess character switches places with a rocker, similar to 2012's ""Barbie: Princess and the Popstar.""  There is also the ""mean girls"" element where some of the girl characters are judgmental and mean.

The song-and-dance numbers are the strongest part of this film. The songs are catchy and the animated dancers perform real and modern choreography. The feel of the musical numbers reminds me of real-action films like ""Disney's High School Musical"", ""Camp Rock"", or even grown-up offerings like the ""Pitch Perfect"" and ""Step Up"" dance films.  The moral of working together and accepting others' differences was a nice touch also.

The songs feature a good mix of styles.  Some of the tracks are musical theater ensembles with great harmonies, like ""Gotta Get to Camp."" The ballad ""What If I Shine"" is a nice track with lyrics about overcoming insecurities. There are two acapella-style songs which really highlight vocalization: ""When You're A Princess"" and ""Unlock Your Dreams.""  The song ""Find Yourself in the Song"" has great rock influence.  There seems to be a lot of influence in the music from popular artists like Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Miley Cyrus. Yet these songs are clean so the whole family can enjoy.  My favorite song is the ""Finale Mash-Up"" which combines two of the previous tracks in an amazing ""Glee""-style number.

Regarding the animation style, it is much better than last year's mess, ""Princess Power"". They fleshed Barbie's frame out since the last film (where she was disturbingly gaunt), and she looks much healthier here.  My favorite animation style of Barbie movies was during 2010-2012 because the colors were vivid, the bodies slim yet healthy, and the faces and hairstyles more detailed and lifelike. Yet in this film, the animators did an amazing with the dance sequences and making the body movements lifelike. I didn't like Lady Anne's helmut-hair style - it was so flat and strange looking. Yet I'm glad that the studio decided to move away from their previous (unsucessfull) attempt in ""Princess Power"" to copy the quirky animation style of Pixar and Disney (think Honey Lemon in ""Big Hero 6).  I thought this film was a vast improvement over the last release.

Overall, this really is an excellent film and I hope the studio will continue to make more like this. I'm surprised these movies aren't more well known and popular because they are just as good if not better than some of the theatrical releases we see from studios like Dreamworks and Disney.  The more I watch ""Rock 'N Royals"" the more I like it and the soundtrack is really great.  This movie should appeal to tweens and younger, or moms like me who have a soft spot for all things Barbie.

NOTE: If you enjoy this film, look at the Barbie website for dates of the ""Rock 'N Royals"" concert mall tour: a 20-minute free concert at select locations. I think that Barbie could easily adapt this film to a stage-musical or live arena show, following in the steps of the Disney company. I look forward to seeing what the Barbie brand will have out next.",1441411200,8,3751,4.9411764705882355
