2582214,5,B000FQJPQO,"My daughter loves this video!!! When I let her pick which Elmo video she wants to watch, she always picks this one. This video not only teaches you about pets, but how to take care of them and all the responsibilities that goes with it. This has got to be the best one yet!!!",1165795200,,275,4.111111111111111
2582215,5,B000FQJPQO,"First, let me say that my son loves Elmo, so just about anything with Elmo in it would be rated as 5 stars if he were writing the reviews. But I, the Mommy, am also giving it 5 stars for the following reasons:

1) This video not only explores the world of pets, but also teaches the responsibilites of keeping them happy and healthy. And it doesn't teach in a didactic manner, but instead uses a fun and subtle approach.

2) This video has a cohesive theme. The first segment is about Pets, the 2nd is about Dogs and the 3rd is about Cats. I appreciate that my son is able to understand the connection between segments. In many Elmo's World videos, there is no unifying theme to the segments offered and I have wondered if this is confusing.

3) There is entertainment value for adults. My husband and I actually enjoy watching this with our 18-month old. Maybe we just love pets, but this video doesn't lose its charm as quickly as Elmo exploring clothing articles or bananas, etc.

4) There are some very tender messages in this video. Kids and adults are shown lovingly caring for their pets, discussing why and how they love their furry, scaly or slimy friends. Elmo talks about his love for Dorothy (his fish). Love, companionship, and responsibility are pronounced themes.

I highly recommend this video. It has pure entertainment value but can also be used as a means to discuss the variety of potential pets for families in the market for one ... and is also a great tool for discussing the responsibilites involved with pet ownership.",1159660800,27,1543,4.596363636363637

It made a 4 hour car ride bearable because we watched it over and over!  After many, many viewings, it still keeps his attention.",1342396800,,265,4.479166666666667

2582236,1,B000FQJPQO,"I must admit first that I have never seen Elmos world, only have seen him on Sesame St. The high pitch fast speech is mind numbing! My grandson is 15 months & loves Ernie on Sesame St., but is not at all interested in this video, and I just feel ripped off. We can't even get thru the video... too painful, literally!",1324166400,,317,4.129032258064516
2582237,5,B000FQJPQO,"My daughter is 14 months old and she loooooooooooooooooooooooves this Elmo's World DVD. When she wakes up early in the morning and we have some time to spare, we'll cuddle up in the recliner and watch a segment or two. She is at the point now when Mr. Noodle is trying to show how to walk a dog that she starts babbling at the television and pointing (I assume she's trying to encourage him to walk the ""dog"" correctly, but that's just me being an overzealous mother!).",1308268800,,469,4.402298850574713

2582240,5,B000FQJPQO,"I bought this for my granddaughter at the request of my daughter-in-law. They used to borrow it often from the library but it wasn't always available. Now she has her own copy and can enjoy it every day. I've never viewed this video personally as I live in another state from them, so I can't tell you any specifics about it.

2582244,4,B000FQJPQO,"My Son Loved the ""Cats"" part of this DVD. My only comment on it is that it includes a segment on ""Dogs"", which is exactly the same as the segment on the ""Babies, Dogs and More"" DVD that I had already purchased before. The duplication was dissapointing to me, I would not have bought this DVD had I known it contained some of the same material I had.",1168387200,11,349,4.147058823529412
2582245,3,B000FQJPQO,"These are great segments, and my three-year-old loves them.  However, of the three segments, two are already included on other Elmo DVDs:  ""Dogs"" is part of ""Babies, Dogs & More"", and ""Pets"" is the 'more' in ""Birthdays, Games & More"".  We've seen ""Cats"" on Sesame Street, and it is a good one, but we were disappointed that this recycled old material.",1165968000,19,351,4.721311475409836
