7476033,5,B016LR90IS,"I saw this yesterday evening in Philadelphia and I was blown away.  The story of Anvil has nothing on this one.  I remember buying Thor's 'Only the Strong' LP back in the '80's and it has always been a favorite of mine.  Seeing the struggles that Thor has been faced with throughout his career has left me speechless.  This man has earned my respect... perhaps more than any other musician.  He has had a dream and refuses to give up on it no matter the cost.
I highly recommend watching this.  I don't think you need to be familiar with his music to appreciate the emotional roller-coaster ride of a man's life's journey.  He has given up so much and received so little to be the best entertainer he can be for his fans.  Seeing 3/4 of the 'Only the Strong' line-up perform after the film screening was something I never thought I'd see.  It was an amazing evening.",1448064000,6,866,4.39622641509434

7476035,5,B016LR90IS,"Just happen to stumble across this screening at the 2015 Housecore Horror Film Festival.
I was blown away. The story behind the band, the man, the legend that never got to be.
Youll laugh, youll be saddened,  youll smile, and ultimately itll warm your heart, and possibly inspire you to never give up on your dreams.

I was amazed to hear Thor would be performing at the festival. And he STILL entertains.
If you love metal, 80s hair metal, youll want to see Thor live.
I witnessed a man finally seeing his dreams come true. Their was a twinkle in his eyes.. and you knew he was happy. He met with all his fans afterwards and was more than happy to meet, greet,  and sign autographs.
It was a very special day.",1447632000,4,710,4.363636363636363
7476036,5,B016LR90IS,"Great epic.
The band is great steve price shredding away

7476037,2,B016LR90IS,"This Doc, was just, ""okay"".
I've thought about selling this back, after watching it, only once.
I can recommend a much better D.V.D. called ""AN-THOR-OLOGY"" 1976-1985.
Which has a TON more, of vintage, COMPLETE, music video performances on it!
One's that this doc, just shows quick clips of. . . . .
This ""doc"", is ALMOST, as depressing, as the documentary, of the 80's Canadian Metal band, ANVIL.
I can't believe that, VH1 Classic, HEAVILY, promoted that turd for 8 months!
That was a HUGE ""let down"".
Anyway, this ""doc"", [ I AM THOR ] BRIEFLY documents Jon's life, from the beginning, to the mid 80's.
With old photographs and video clips.
Then it ""picks up"" with
(present day), Jon Mikl ""THOR"". After his wife, of over a decade,
(that he sacrificed his career for, [to sit home with!] ""walks out on him""!
Now he is bloated & balding.
Jon embarks on a Canadian ""comeback club tour"" that lasts OVER A DECADE!
Where he is selling T-Shirts, autographed pictures, & videos of vintage performances, because he needs the money!
(reminiscent of scenes in,
""THE WRESTLER"")
(Which, ""I"" think, is a great movie!)
I love this man! He has such heart, drive, bravery & potential!
If he had just, gotten the right manager/agent in the late 70's & 80's. He could have been HUGE, with all the ""Hair Metal Bands""! Especially if he could have hooked up with Vince McMahon & the WWF, and cross promoted!
THOR had such potential! Very sad!",1487376000,,1420,4.661354581673307

7476039,4,B016LR90IS,"Thor, the third-tier heavy metal muscleman from Canada, is out there still doing his thing in this highly-recommended rockumentary.  The guy has certainly led an interesting and colorful life.  After a hiatus of ten years, and realizing that domesticated life was not for him, Thor and his band hit the road again, touring places like Sweden and Finland and knocking audiences dead with their over the top stage show.  If you're a fan of Thor's music or a fan of metal music in general, check out I Am Thor and catch up with one of the underrated legends of theatrical metal.",1471132800,2,575,4.673267326732673

7476041,5,B016LR90IS,"I had no clue what to expect going into this. I'm only vaguely familiar with Jon Mikl Thor, and only because we recently saw his hilariously awful 80's horror flick Rock n' Roll Nightmare (which he wrote himself). Then we heard they were making a doc on his life, and so when it finally became available we invited a few friends over and checked it out. Verdict? We had a blast. Even if you're not necessarily a fan of Rock n Roll or Metal, this is such an endearing and entertaining doc. It follows his entire career, up to his current status, and his attempt at a comeback. It's really, really good. The guy puts on one helluva show and we have now made it our goal to see him live before it's too late. It will be one of the coolest shows we'll ever see. Watch this, even if your curious. It's a lot of fun and one of the best docs we've seen in years.",1467072000,2,855,4.125748502994012

7476047,4,B016LR90IS,"Ten years after fans got the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-THOR-logy/dp/B0009N31E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An-THOR-logy</a>&nbsp;DVD, a Blu-Ray release of I AM THOR debuts and picks up where the story left off in the life of Muscle Rock pioneer Jon Mikl Thor, who parlayed his childhood love of comic books, superheroes and muscle mags into a career that has spanned over four decades.

The first third is basically a condensed version of Thors early years as bodybuilder, nude waiter, Vegas performer and metal Rock God. Here we get many of the same clips as found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-THOR-logy/dp/B0009N31E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An-THOR-logy</a>&nbsp;except this time the story is told from the perspective of former club promoters, girlfriend and various band members, and most importantly, THOR himself. There is an underlying sense of disappointment and even pity here as we learn why THOR never had the career he should have, never reaching the heights of Alice Cooper or Kiss. He never had that one elusive hit that would have ingrained him into public consciousness. Instead he was sort of on the fringe, a cult figure who would never really become a household name.

The remainder of the film plays more liked THOR: THE REALITY SHOW as we follow his comeback in the late 1990s and 2000s as he travels across Canada and the US looking considerably bloated from ailments both mental and physical, meds and stress and he singlehandedly tries to manage his own career (including creating an alter-ego to act as his fictional managerthe non-existent Steve Scott). It is almost too much to bear, seeing the exhausted rocker struggling to squeeze into his costumes, navigating airports while steering teetering piles of suitcases and trying to remain calm while enduring one setback after another on his tour. Yet THOR perseveres and the final act has him and his band enjoying an almost ridiculously huge outpouring of adoration from fans in Sweden and Finland which in the final moments, has him second-guess his own decision to retire, and makes the wearying journey totally worth it for both THOR himself, and us the viewer.

I AM THOR paints a portrait of a guy whos never willing to give up on a dream, no matter how much the odds are stacked against him and because we see it happening for real on-screen, it resonates all the more.",1456012800,9,2459,5.4319371727748695

I have seen many music documentaries over the years and this one is easily my favorite. It has a good balance to the rise of the band while also showing how the band are comprised of regular dudes. There are many reviews out there already glowing with more positivity than I can give.

Then in the late 80's he just disappeared and I always wondered why.  This documentary explains it all. Very well done in my opinion, it is tragic, triumphant, sad, funny and ultimately inspiring.",1454457600,,382,4.366197183098592
7476052,4,B016LR90IS,"I Am Thor is the story of Jon Mikl Thor, a blonde bodybuilder/rock star whose band THOR was a 1970s staple along with such acts as Kiss. He has shared shared the stage with such top acts as Motorhead, Anvil, Thin Lizzy, W.A.S.P., and Manowar, yet he and his band never reached his show biz Holy Grail  gold record status.

Thor starred in the cult movie classics Rock n Roll Nightmare, Recruits, and Zombie Nightmare, but disappeared shortly afterward from the world of entertainment. But ten years into retirement and incapable of living a normal, non-celebrity life, he attempted a comeback to achieve the level of success that had eluded him his entire career.

Filmed over a period of several years, I Am Thor focuses on a career beset by bad fortune. mismanagement, ill health, and more than a few unfortunate coincidences. A showman first and foremost, Thor wears elaborate costumes, incorporates light shows, shows off feats of strength and sings rock n roll  songs written by Thor himself. He may not sell out auditoriums, but his audiences are thoroughly entertained.

Despite the countless obstacles hes faced. Thor has an Energizer bunny mentality that just keeps him chugging along, doing what he loves. His optimism is infectious, and the love relationship with his appreciative fans quite touching.

The only bonus feature on the Blu-ray release is the films theatrical trailer.",1453420800,,1392,5.030434782608696

No i'm not being paid to post this.  You can pm me if you want more info.

Great movie. Great story of a legend and amazing frontman.  People don't realize how great Thor's songs are.  So underrated. Great riffs.  The movie has amazing footage and shows a real side of Thor you don't see.

I wish Knock Em Down music video was shown in the movie.  It was his biggest hit but was completely ignored.  That was my only gripe.

Great movie.  Highly suggest it for your music DVD library.",1451433600,,503,4.189473684210526

Even though it pokes fun at itself you come away with how much work and dedication is involved in the making of a legend, in one mans mind.  He has no shame and really truly enjoys his persona and treats all his fans with the utmost respect.  By the end of the movie I was a fan.  Very well done",1523318400,,467,4.202247191011236

8736764,4,B016LR90IS,"Metal - of all rock and roll's children - demands youth. What makes ""I Am Thor"" ultimately touching is that it gets back to that other part of metal, and probably all of rock and roll in general. We're misfits, it's what calls us to it.

John Mikl Thor had an eyeblink where he was that cartoonized version of himself we all wish we could be. And then life happens and time happens and you wake up and you're older and you get tired. But for Thor, the enthusiasm didn't die. He's an unapologetic heavy metal, rock and roll geek...and just that affirmation that this spirit is still out there in the world seems to keep the guy going. I came into this movie feeling like it was just another case of the young laughing at age. I left touched. For the kids that still can feel the love of rock Thor celebrates, it's clear the entire spirit of the whole idea isn't completely dead...and that's worth this journey.

We live in a time of sarcasm, irony and arrogance. I take a definite comfort that John is out there still letting go, being laughed at and laughing along. Rock and roll is fun - or should be - and if there's no place for someone like Thor, then rock is truly dead...and wouldn't that be sad?",1521158400,2,1202,4.314159292035399

8736767,5,B016LR90IS,"RELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Ryan Wise, ""I Am Thor"" is documentary on the life of flamboyant body-builder/metal front-man Jon Mikl Thor and his band, Thor, from its beginnings in the 70s-early 80s to more recent years.

I remember seeing albums by Thor (the band) at record stores back in the day and my response was always, Um no. I guess I dismissed them because I wasn't sure if I was to take them serious. The guy looked like the superhero Thor come to life, but as a rock god; and I wasn't sure how I was supposed to take it. I finally heard some of their music a few years ago on Youtube, like Let the Blood Run Red and Triumphant, and I found it catchy, raw & passionate in the manner of early Anvil and Twisted Sister. Theres also a little Venom, but without the goat-sucking buffoonery (but a LOT of other buffoonery), not to mention the occasional wannabe Norse epic-ness of Manowar (e.g. Warriors of the Universe).  Meanwhile, their stage antics recalled KISS, Alice Cooper and (again) Twisted Sister. The musics simplistic, but kinetic & fun metal that gets your blood pumping.

Im just trying to establish how little I knew about Thor, the man or his band, and yet I found this movie entertaining from beginning to end. I cant tell you how many times I busted out laughing. For comparison, I Am Thor is superior to 2008s Anvil: The Story of Anvil and 2004s Some Kind of Monster, at least as far as being more compelling and amusing.

The last act is the best, covering the reunited band from their glory days 1983-87, albeit with a new, younger bass player. That was the era when the band had their biggest success in England before abruptly ending when Jon decided to try his hand at acting. A decade later Jon decided to get the band back together and thats when his ex-porn-star wife said Buh bye. In 2009, with his reunited band, Thor landed three concerts at sizeable festivals in Scandinavia, where the band is generally hailed. Say what you will, but Jon & co. know how to put on a show and Jon loves what he does and loves the people, despite the many hassles and unforeseen setbacks. Speaking of which, theres a montage of statements by fans or people whove worked with Jon and they unanimously said hes one of the nicest guys to know and work with. That tells you everything you need to know.

Lastly, remember this: Before there was Manowar, there was Thor.

THE FILM RUNS 82 minutes, never overstaying its welcome.

GRADE: A",1515196800,,2453,4.511261261261262
8736768,5,B016LR90IS,"Equal parts ""Behind The Music"" and ""This Is Spinal Tap"", ""I Am THOR"" tells the story of would-be rock star Jon Mikl Thor and his on-again, off-again band mates as they go from young up-and-comers in the 1970s and 80s, to utterly forgotten in the 1990s, to an unlikely resurgence in Scandinavia as the 21st century rolls on to its second decade.

The film is completely candid in telling the bizarre back story of a competitive body builder and former nude waiter who rose to the brink of stardom fronting a band whose stage shows put KISS and Alice Cooper to shame, but then lost it all through a series of poor decisions and unfortunate circumstances, culminating in a nervous breakdown and forced retirement to a house in the suburbs with his wife.  That alone would be enough to make for an engrossing documentary, but in this case you'll have literally only heard half the story.  The film then picks up shortly after the new millennium as Jon Mikl struggles to resurrect his rock career on the heels of what appears to be an amicable divorce.  You'll see it all: from playing shows in front of paying crowds who can be counted on his fingers, to hocking his own t-shirts outside of gigs, to inventing an imaginary manager and maintaining that ruse for years.  But then, more than a decade into his ""comeback"" and just as it seems the dream will truly end, THOR finds new life in a foreign land...not Japan, but Sweden and Finland.

Throughout the film, Jon Mikl comes off as somewhat self-centered, somewhat naive, something of a pain at times to work with, but somehow also a genuinely nice person.  There are 'Tap-esque moments galore: discovering a stage manager has ordered plain red bricks instead of cinder blocks to be smashed during his show, arriving in Sweden only to discover that the airline has lost his baggage (complete with costumes and props), pulling a muscle while rehearsing for an upcoming gig (in their hotel room), and listening to the band's drummer (who has grown into a near dead ringer for Ron Jeremy) earnestly lecture a younger band member on the evils of drinking before returning to his Jagerbomb.  Thor as a whole demonstrate a sincere love and appreciation of their fans, even as they pine for the mega-stardom they had once been on the cusp of.  This, more than any other music doc I've watched, allows the viewer to truly get a glimpse inside the musicians and comprehend the incredible highs and lows, demands and rewards, of life in a rock band.",1502409600,,2487,4.685779816513762
8736769,5,B016LR90IS,"I've never watched a funnier and more brutal documentary than I Am Thor. It's direct marketing. It's all about Thor. He's the alter ego of a guy named Jon Mikl and other stuff. Jon Mikl is a good name. It's even better when combined with the name Thor.  The problem with choosing that stage name is that you have to live up to it. Jon gives it his best as the documentary shows for over 4 decades.

The documentary starts out with a baby Thor in photographs. It moves on to more adult Thor during his...ahem...adult performance phase. It's the first of many brutal moments where the documentary points out that Thor didn't measure up in the third leg department to another performer and fell from grace. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. He falls backward into metal music. It leads to him getting close to the big time and then the rest of the story happens that's by turns kind of tragic, almost always hilarious, and kind of inspiring. Jon barrels head long through one obstacle after another not noticing the one that's right under his nose in himself. The documentary never lets Jon off the hook. it's the tragic part but goodness is he still likable. You even start to feel for him as his mental state is clearly wrecked and explains a ton of the self obstructing behavior. But when one is Thor, one must Thor!

It's free on prime. I can't recommend it enough. I haven't had this much fun with a documentary in forever.",1501286400,4,1435,4.469465648854962
