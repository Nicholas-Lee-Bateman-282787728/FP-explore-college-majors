98644,2,0790729989,"As many have said before, Seven is a great movie.
Unfortunately, Seven is also an extremely poor DVD.  Not only is the disc a flipper, requiring you to turn the disc over mid-film, it includes absolutely no extras.  Granted this disc was produced in a time when RSDL-capable mastering plants  were scarce, but that is not the case now.  There is absolutely no reason  why a disc of such poor quality is allowed to remain on the market",924739200,2,434,4.512820512820513
98645,5,0790729989,"this film had it all - an excellent score, brilleant screenplay debut by andrew walker, oscar-winning performances by spacey and freeman (presumably not given by the academy because they hadn't got the bottle to go out on a  limb with this movie ) a cinematic masterpiece. miss this film at your  peril !!",923875200,,305,4.735849056603773
98646,3,0790729989,"truly a brilliant, *dark* piece of filmmaking.  in particular, the small details of the Dt. Sommerall character (he sleeps with a running metronome, he has a switchblade fetish) make a great impact.
as much as i liked  the film itself, i have to say that i was disappointed with the transfer to  DVD.  the video image, while crisp, would occasionally ""stutter"",  as if the projector were skipping a few frames.  also, in the scene in the  killer's apartment, the audio drops out for a moment.  both of these  problems got in the way of enjoying a magnificent film.
don't even get me  started on how annoyed i was at having to flip the disc halfway through the  movie...",918259200,,669,4.584745762711864

98698,4,0790729989,"There's no argument that Seven is a superbly made film. It was a sincere effort by a director to really attempt to disturb his audience, at least that I remember (although Blue Velvet was probably the most disturbing horror/mystery film I had seen up to that time). I watched this at the theater with my girlfriend when it came out. During the movie we discussed walking out of it, although we didn't. When the movie was over, we walked out to the car, got in and looked at each other with a look like, ""WTF did we just watch...""  Yah. It was disturbing. Possibly the only more disturbing mainstream film I have seen is the US remake of ""Funny Games..""  I can watch Seven now with some detachment and appreciate the filmcraft but it is still not what I would call enjoyable..",1523232000,,775,4.450704225352113

The movie is disgusting, disturbing and the ending predictable and just as disgusting and disturbing as the rest of the movie. Pitt's acting was strange and left me with the feeling that he didn't like the story as much as me. He never really connected with his character. If you wonder what is wrong with society today, watch this movie, and like me, shake your head that so many people gave this great reviews. Garbage in, garbage out.

99162,4,0790729989,"I remember when this movie came out, I was a lot younger then and it made more of an impression then as opposed to now.
I also own the special edition DVD, and I haven't watched the movie in years but saw the blu-ray on sale so I figured I would grab it as I'm working on getting blu-rays of all my DVDs. Anyway, Seven is a good movie yes, but not that good, I re-watched it when the blu-ray arrived and it just doesn't seem to be as good as I remember. I guess it's because I'm older now that it doesn't have the same effect on me.
I know a lot of people aren't going to agree with me on this, but it's just not as good as I remember. This is one of those movies that I can't watch multiple times as once you know what happens it's not worth watching again and again. I think it's a movie that every horror fan should see yes, it is good and suspenseful and intriguing. I loved the way the movie played out and I was truly surprised by the ending the first time I saw it.
The blu-ray quality is very good and the extras are interesting.

99182,5,0790729989,"What does Dante's ""Divine Comedy"", Christopher Marlowe's ""The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus"", John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"", and the film ""Seven"" have in common? They all reference the ""Seven Deadly Sins"". The Seven Deadly Sins, also known as the Capital Vices or Cardinal Sins, is a classification of vices propagated by the early Christian Church as being the most objectionable and immoral. They fit within St Augustine's rhetoric in terms of fallen humanity's tendency to sin. The list consists of gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. ""Seven"" incorporates the literary references of the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" into a compelling but shocking serial killer story.

Brad Pit, in one of his best performances, plays a rookie detective, David Mills, teamed with veteran and soon-to-be-retiring Detective William Somerset, played by Morgan Freeman in one of the best roles of his unequaled career. They are investigating a series of ghastly homicides in an American urban center that seems a helluva lot like Chicago. The veteran detective has seen almost everything an urban cop can endure during an average career before the beginning of the story. However, as events transpire, they reveal things even he, after decades on the force, hasn't experienced. The rookie has no idea what's in store for him, and by movie's end he will have sustained the most horrific experience of a police detective coming-of-age ever shot on film. We get the sense all rookie detectives go through a kind of ""baptism of fire"" but nothing which would prepare a newbie to the force something as simultaneously horrific and devastating as that presented in ""Seven"".

Unlike the usual street crime, these murders have a disturbing combination of dreadful horror coupled with high literary intelligence. The killer incorporates religious and literary symbolism into his acts of unspeakable violence and murder. Each act and victim reference a different ""Deadly Sin"". The killer may be mad but he is an highly intelligent madman, who could probably quote Dante while loading a Magnum 44. The well-known actor who plays the killer/religious fanatic who reveals himself toward the end is perfect casting.

Hollywood rarely produces films with such a combination of horror and high intelligence. The closest comparable film is ""Silence of the Lambs"" whose character Hannibal Lecter is strikingly similar to the fiend in this film, although their motivations are entirely different. Both of these characters, the killer of ""Seven"" and Hannibal Lecter, are homicidal sociopaths of uncommon literary knowledge, which communicate disturbing overtones of higher purpose. They are the type who would probably view the act of crucifixion as an artistic statement.

This is an incredible film both in its dreadfulness and its cerebral content, but definitely not for the feint of heart or the squeamish. As for myself, this is probably the limit in terms of the disturbing meter--worse than this would be out of bounds. Despite the gruesome subject matter, this film has enough compelling elements, from the literary references to the relationship between Pitt and Freeman, that it does work as a masterpiece of the serial killer genre. And the ending is one of the most compelling and original conclusions I have ever witnessed in this type of film, but don't expect the main characters to be celebrating with beers at the end. There are very subtle hints during the film which point to how the movie's ending will unfold, but like most movie-goers during my initial viewing, the ending erupts like a dragon flying straight out of Hell.",1473206400,11,3620,5.225473321858864

Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt do their thing together on screen. Kevin Spacey, as John Doe, makes the most of his on screen time by being as creepy as Hannibal Lector (a wonderful Anthony Hopkins) in Silence of the Lambs. I've seen this movie a number of times and it still gives me
the ""willies"" whenever I watch it, but it's so good that I just can't resist picking it up - like a good mystery novel. If you like the slow unraveling of a good solid murder-mystery, then get the popcorn, turn out the lights and get ready to be ""creepified.""",1468800000,3,689,4.348837209302325

He may be an utter nincompoop as an actor overall, but this may actually be a low point, I'm not an expert on his career.  Morgan Freeman, however, should be ashamed of himself for being in this movie, because he is a higher level person, he was the stunningly effective star of Shawshank Redemption, and this is a major low point in terms of his judgment.",1463961600,,542,4.4

99366,5,0790729989,"Saw this brilliant film at the theater, and it was absolutely devastating.

More than Morgan Freeman and even Brad Pitt, who are both good, as expected, and just followed their roles, the focus had been on the girlfriend of new heartthrob Brad Pitt.

Then Gwyneth Paltrow was herald but as a shy newcomer, pretty but not beautiful, sweet and even shy, and no one was sure of her talent.  No one knew about her, and everybody was watching.  She is vulnerable and kind.  She is the heart of the film.

She is miserable in the city, desperate for friendship.  Her husband, Brad Pitt/Detective David Mills, a recently promoted but inexperienced detective, runs wild, excited, adventurous with no tenure, training, and experience.  She followed, in devotion to her husband, but finds an ally in Detective Lieutenant William Somerset, who is seasoned, mature, smart, and he immediately grasps the gravity of the situation.

It is a hard film to endure, but I loved it just the same, though I loathed some examples of the seven deadly sins.  (Really prostitution as lust - it's a money thing, not a ""I want to f - thing.)

Still the story is great, and the performances were solid.",1460764800,,1174,4.762376237623762

99656,1,0790729989,"This  movies  not  for  everybody.  As  far  as  myself  goes,  I  have  watched  it  in  the  past  &  I  gave  it  up  after  a  while,  I  am  rewriting  my  review  because  the  first  one  was  a  [Spoiler  alert]!  There  are  7  deaths,  I  didn't  catch  all  of  them  because  I  don't  pay  much  attention.  In  this  show  you  will  witness  some  of  the  most  horror  in  movie  history.  Watch  &  decide  for  yourself.  I  still  own  it  on  VHS.  I  don't  watch  it  too  often.  Trying  to  decide  whether  or  not  to  keep  the  movie  is  the  tough  part.
I  promise  you  though  this  movie  will  give  you  one  hell  of  a  shock!!  Its  not  at  all  pretty  while  2  detectives  trace  &  chase  a  criminal  committing  the  sins.
Its  the  kind  of  movie  some  folks  may  not  prefer  to  watch  alone.  You  might  be  grossed  out  by  this  movie.  Once  you've  seen  it  its  often  hard  to  forget  the  scenes  you  saw  in  the  movie.  I  learned  that  much  about  it.  Brad  Pitt  &  Morgan  Freeman,  &  Kevin Spacey  all  do  a  splendid  job  in  their  scripts.
But  it  is  the  type  to  enjoy  during  Halloween  I'll  say  that.  Or  for  those  of  you  that  like  a  good  scare  every  now  &  then.  Me?  I  got  goosebumps  from  watching  this.  There  they  go  trying  to  catch  an  expert  criminal.  I  call  him  that  because  he's  a  difficult  suspect  to  apprehend.  &  knows  how  to  avoid  the  law  when  he  senses  their  outside  the  door  of  his  apartment.
In  the  movie  Brad  should  have  asked  his  wife  to  leave  the  city  &  get  to  safe  place  where  the  Villain  couldn't  find  her  whereabouts  &  who  she  was.  But  Does  he  ask  his  wife  to  leave?  Hell  No!
Most  of  all  the  ending  could  have  been  so  much  better  then  it  was.  This  movie  Stinks.  &  the  part  where  they  find  a  body  that  is  almost  a  skeleton  &  the  most  shocking  &  spooky  part  was  that  dude  was  alive!  But  was  unable  to  communicate  with  them  other  than  coughing,  in  regards  to  his  condition  as  sort  of  a  cry  for  help  because  of  his  condition.  Now  I  think  the  criminal  had  been  forcing  him  to  take  drugs  constantly  forcing  him  into  the  habit  over  time  making  him  how  he  was,  brilliant  in  his  handy  work  so  that  it  would  be  more  difficult  for  the  detectives  to  convict  him  right  there.  I  knew  they  had  to  come  up  with  something solid  in  or  to  tie  him  to  the  crimes.  But  they  knew  all  along  what  he  was  doing.  That's  the  interesting  part.
Ending  is  Sad,  &  probably  the  most  disturbing  part  of  the  movie!!!!!!!!!!!",1443312000,,2745,4.08167770419426

Freeman, the cold and now disinterested type wanting to retire to get away from city violence, and Pitt, the new blood wanting to take on a case his superiors think is too big for him, end up working as partners to unravel the motive behind a serial killer's dark spree. What I really like about this movie is the constantly dark overtones that set the stage for the killer and the defectives' search for him. Furthermore, the plot, for its time, is original in its own right and kept me wondering what was going to happen all the way up to and through the now famous ""What's in the box?!"" scene. The ending is one that was actually handled surprisingly well, the kind that leaves people wondering about modern society and if there's more than one antagonist to the film.

Morgan Freeman is a retiring city detective. He takes Brad Pitt under his wing as a serial killer is on the loose, killing people in theme with the seven deadly sins. Good film with a decent Howard Shore sound track. I did catch a NIN rift during the credits. I thought the ending was predictable. And personally I would have used the alternate note book ending they never filmed, because that was what I expected.

At two hours long, we still don't get to know any history or the mind of the killer. That would have been nice.

99794,5,0790729989,"I've mentioned before my love of mystery and detective stories, and ""Se7en"" is one of the best of its kind.  Yet, after seeing it during its theatrical release in 1995, the ending so disturbed me I had no desire ever to watch it again.  Time heals all wounds, I suppose, and I was able to view and enjoy it with fresh eyes when it arrived in a fresh new DVD transfer some years ago.  Now, we get the movie in a high-definition Blu-ray Book edition, looking and sounding better than ever.  But I would caution any viewer in advance that the film, like others from director David Fincher (""Fight Club,"" ""Zodiac""), explores unsavory territory and ends in a most unsettling manner.  Be forewarned.

Although Brad Pitt gets top billing, the film really belongs to Morgan Freeman, who proves once more why he is one of Hollywood's finest actors.  He is brilliant as the aging New York City police detective, Lt. William Somerset, who is seven days from retirement when he stumbles onto a series of grisly serial killings.  Somerset is reluctant to work the investigation; he wants nothing more than to retire to the quiet of the country.  But he is at heart a policeman, and the lure of one last big case is irresistible.  His new partner is a young up-and-comer named David Mills (Pitt), a person completely opposite the older man.  Whereas Somerset is single, quiet, reserved, studious, contemplative, fastidious, and probably lonely, Mills has a wife, and he's macho, hot-tempered, anxious, and impetuous.  Mills has been with the force five years but thinks he knows more than Somerset, who's been doing police work for thirty-four year.  The younger detective is more emotionally open and more apt to break rules than his conservative partner.  The older detective is more calculating, more the detached observer.  The story is as much about their relationship and their individual personalities as it is about the murders they investigate.

Now, about those murders.  The detectives initially discover an obese man dead from overeating.  When they see his hands and feet tied, with bruises from the end of a gun pressed to his forehead, they conclude that somebody forced him to eat himself to death.  However, it isn't until they find the second victim that they notice a pattern.  The second guy is a wealthy defense attorney they find bled to death, with a pound of flesh extracted from his body.  Somerset sees it first.  The victims are being murdered according to the medieval ""Seven Deadly Sins"":  gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy.  Mention of the sins dates back probably as early as the sixth century, but Saint Thomas Aquinas made them famous in his thirteenth-century manuscript ""Summa Theologica.""  A century later, Dante Alighieri celebrated them again in his ""Divine Comedy"" and still later by Geoffrey Chaucer in his ""Canterbury Tales.""  The third casualty falls victim to sloth; the detectives find him tied to a bed, apparently kept alive and tormented for a full year.  And so on.

Indulging in a clever bit of character exposition, the story has the two detectives attack the mystery of the killings in different ways.  Somerset goes to the public library and does his homework by checking out Aquinas, Dante, and Chaucer.  Mills, on the other hand, researches the crime by ordering up copies of ""Cliff's Notes.""  Thankfully, by the way, we never actually see the murders.  The victims are already dead when we get to them, which doesn't make the film any the less gruesome for forcing us to use our imagination.

Among the excellent supporting cast are Gwyneth Paltrow as David's long-suffering wife; R. Lee Ermey as a police captain; Kevin Spacey as one of several murder suspects; and Richard Roundtree and John C. McGinley thrown in for good measure.  All of the actors do well in their roles, but they pale beside the granite substance of Freeman's portrayal.  We come to respect his character for the perseverance he displays; we admire him for the intelligence and dedication he demonstrates; yet we pity him, too, for the solitary condition he has imposed upon himself.  He is like an insightful yet resigned poet, able to see and comment on the defects of human behavior without ever fully able to remedy them.

In addition to his successful delineation of character in the film, director Fincher uses a dark, evocative atmosphere to capture superbly the essence of the story he's telling.  As the murderer leads the policemen a merry chase, purposely leaving clues for them to follow, either daring them to find him or wanting them to catch him, he draws them deeper into the dark bowels of the city, much as Dante's sightseers in ""The Divine Comedy"" are lead ever lower into the depths of hell.

To be sure, Fincher stretches credibility on more than a few occasions.  One doubts, for instance, that any murderer could be as precise or as patient as this madman is; that any metropolis, even New York, could possibly be as ugly as this one; or that any city could have as many crimes committed on every street corner at every moment as are depicted here.  But as good figurative storytelling, ""Se7en"" comes as close to perfection as possible, with its biggest exception being that ending I mentioned--unnerving and disquieting, intellectually and emotionally.  Still, it may be what people remember most.

Video:
According to one of the accompanying featurettes, Fincher went back and fiddled with the video for home theater, and the New Line engineers use a VC-1 codec and a dual-layer BD50 to reproduce it.  Nevertheless, this is not to suggest the current picture quality is perfect.  I admired its sharp gradations of contrast, its precise imaging, and its excellent skin tones.  The picture looks best in close-ups, but it is less distinct in distance shots.  Fincher intentionally created a dull, dark look, with the appearance of natural lighting the order of the day for a dingy, dirty, dusky city.  Accordingly, definition varies from ultra sharp to downright soft.

Audio:
New Line offer the soundtrack in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, which is quite precise in all the channels, with excellent deep bass.  Again, the engineers have specially processed the sound for home reproduction so it appears more extended at the high end, more natural in the midrange, and not so prominent in the lower treble.  The audio track provides wide dynamics and well-distributed ambient noises among the various speakers.  Often, though, aural effects overshadow the voices.  Turn up the volume enough to hear what people are saying clearly and things like rain and peripheral noise become too loud.  This was, I'm sure, deliberate on Fincher's part to create a realistic environment for the characters, but it doesn't make it any easier trying to follow the plot.  Likewise for Howard Shore's musical score, which does a fine job underlining the movie's noir tone but sometimes overpowers the dialogue.

Extras:
The Blu-ray edition contains four audio commentaries.  These commentaries feature (1) director David Fincher and actors Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman; (2) host Richard Dyer with Fincher, screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, editor Richard Francis-Bruce, and New Line President of Production Michael De Luca; (3) Dyer, Fincher, Francis-Bruce, director of photography Darious Khondji, and production designer Arthur Max; and (4) Dyer, Fincher, composer Howard Shore, and sound designer Ren Klyce.  Following these are brief segments on ""Production Design"" and John Doe's ""Notebooks,"" and then several stills galleries.

Next, we get an exploration of the opening title sequence; a series of deleted scenes; an alternate ending sequence and storyboards of an ""un-shot"" ending""; and segments on ""Mastering for Home Theater,"" covering audio mastering, video mastering, and color correction, with options to compare before and after scenes.

The extras conclude with a theatrical trailer; thirty-seven scene selections; English, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and other spoken languages; Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish, and other subtitles; and English and German captions for the hearing impaired.  The Blu-ray disc itself comes housed in the back of an attractive Blu-ray Book, containing about thirty-six pages of text and pictures.

Parting Thoughts:
With subject matter reminiscent of ""Silence of the Lambs,"" the film ""Se7en"" is a noir murder mystery that plays in part like a psychological drama and in part like a horror movie.  There is even a not-so-subtle allusion to ""Silence of the Lambs"" in its reference to ""Wild Bill's Leather Shop.""  Close enough.  The dark style of ""Se7en"" is also reminiscent of Fincher's later film, ""Fight Club,"" but it's better than ""Fight Club"" for keeping its focus and not trying to go in different directions at once.

Remember, though, that one needs a strong stomach and an open mind in viewing ""Se7en.""  The MPAA rated the film R for its blood, gore, profanity, and unwholesome situations.  The film's rewards lie in its characterizations, thought, atmosphere, action, mystery, and suspense.  Seems a fair trade.",1434758400,4,9104,5.0930546190155095

Seven is a psychological thriller starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, who are detectives working on the case of brutal murders. Each murder relates to one the seven deadly sins; sloth, greed, lust, envy, pride, gluttony and wrath. As the story progresses, the more you gain insight on the overall moral of the story; ""We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it.""

What impressed me the most was the cinematography, direction, and dark style of the film. The credit sequence deserves a special mention, it was fanstastic. Although it's basically a typical crime thriller it does have an interesting plot with the whole setup. It's a slow first hour but it builds up nicely leading to the chase scene which is one of the best in the whole genre. The look of the film adds to everything a lot. It's almost always dark and raining, yet the cinematography is vibrant and grainy. The characters and acting is where it stumbles a little. The weak characters didn't bother me a whole lot but I feel Morgan Freeman is at least slightly miscast or underused. This was before Brad Pitt was a household name so it's understandable he's still refining his acting chops but this is easily one his weakest performances I've seen. Some of his dialogue is pretty bad or poorly delivered. I'd like to think a cop would be a little more professional even though he's going up against a psychopath.  Gwenyth Paltrow is pretentious as always but her role is a minor one so its not an annoyance. Kevin Spacey is excellent. Over all I would like to see it again.

However you really do just turn your brain off and enjoy it. If you try and think about it it's really too ridiculous to take serious. The murders are rather cartoony and violent but it's more shocking and grotesque than bloody and messy. It's an over the top noir crime thriller that delivers enough though. The ending really is something that's worth seeing the movie for alone. It's shot in an entirely different location than the rest of the movie and it's unique for that alone. The climax is kind of hinted at towards the end but when everything plays out it's very effective. I really liked the last few lines of the movie basically saying that the world is not a happy and wonderful place but it's still worth fighting for.",1420502400,,2036,4.514905149051491

The picture is excellent, perfectly recreating the oppressive visuals nearly exactly the way they were presented in theaters and the 7.1 DTS-MA HD audio track will light up your speakers in all sorts of inventive ways. One sequence in particular that deserves note in terms of audio is the Sloth scene, where every speaker chimes in with what sounds like fluttering moth wings and/or snipping scissors. Crazy stuff. The extras are pretty much the same that was offered on the previously released two disc DVD set from a few years back but it's all good stuff, complete with multiple filmmaker commentaries and interesting featurettes on the production and design of the film. Seven is a film that's not for everyone due to it's grim, nihilistic tone and harsh violence and subject matter but it truly is an incredible film that's worth taking the ride that it offers. After nearly twenty years, it's a film that I revisit often and this Blu Ray does quite a bit of justice to it. The book style packaging doesn't hurt either.",1404172800,12,1113,4.802083333333333

This movie provides understated menace and plenty of discomforting  moments against a dark, moody backdrop of ""a city"" somewhere in urban America.

But sometimes, it's not the characters that make for an interesting pairing...it's the actors.  Here, female heartthrob Brad Pitt is paired with self-styled philosopher Morgan Freeman (how did Pitt get his name above Freeman's?  I mean, they were both good, but come on...it's Morgan Freeman) as they track down a serial killer basing his murders on the Seven Deadly Sins, which Morgan Freeman happens to know plenty about.  I won't say who the killer was except for that he was a welcome surprise and wonderfully creepy in his role...a nice baddie for this series of heinous crimes.  As the rookie and the veteran begin to bond, they go from one grizzly scene to another, all the while analyzing the killer's motives and his next move.  One of them just happens to know about some covert government surveillance that any conspiracy nut would point to as ""Exhibit A"" and which also helps their case.  In the meantime, Pitt is married to Gwyneth Paltrow and the two of them spend life trying to adjust to living in a new city while making ends meat on a public servant's salary.  Paltrow occasionally turns to Morgan Freeman for advice and he tries his best to help keep up their solid marriage.  This film thankfully ignored most, if not all, of the usual conflicts we get with new police pairings and just focused on the case while still enabling our two leads to bond.  The three-way bond between Freeman, Pitt, and Paltrow works well and pays off in a bad (but convincing way) at the end of the film, leaving a bitter-sweet taste in our mouths as we try to anticipate what could be happening to everyone even as the credits are rolling.  This is a solid film and certainly above the average buddy cop films like Rush Hour and Lethal Weapon.  I think we have our leads to thank there.  Enjoy.",1402876800,2,1896,4.657657657657658

i was looking forward to updating my copy of seven from dvd to blu ray. i got the blu ray and the audio is mixed completely wrong. the ambient noise and the background music complete drown out almost the entire dialog. i tried to change the audio off my 5.1 to stereo, but there is no option in the menu to do so. when i tried unplugging my audio and just letting the tv stereo run, i still couldn't make out any of the dialog. what is worse, the volume is not constant, so if you turn it up to ty to hear the dialog,you are going to get your ear drums burst when the background music or ambient noise picks back up.

It's a good movie, but if you can count and have a reasonable imagination, you can predict the ending. For some, that's a deal-breaker. But, the movie in its entirety, even if the ending isn't a complete surprise, is still a worthwhile watch. It's always nice to see Morgan Freeman in a leading instead of supporting role, and the plot is well planned.

Since CGI and special effects technology have come along to the point where we can show the most gruesome and violent acts on screen, everyone rushes to do just that; to show us the violence. Where Seven shines (and outshines the others) is in eschewing graphic on-screen gore and leaving it all to our collective mind's eye.

Virtually all the violence and gore in Seven is *implied*. Instead of being shown, the viewer is forced to imagine the horrific and depraved events in the movie, and because of this those events have far more impact on us than anything we could have been shown.",1389657600,,651,4.612068965517241

100463,5,0790729989,"If Fincher didn't invent the convention of the brilliant serial killer always being just one step ahead of the police, he unquestionably perfected it here. This is the twisted psychopath unleashing his vengeance upon the deserving, avaricious world at its absolute best. And this remains Finchers best film.

Two cops in New York are hunting a serial killer. The presence of the killer is momentous even before the detectives track him down, once caught, the killer is channeled through Kevin Spacey with a disturbingly authentic evil calm.

Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, this amazing original script that was almost never made. Walker wrote it as an original screenplay around 1991. Apparently he was quite depressed at the time. New Line Cinema bought it, but it took years before it went into production Walker went to work on other projects thinking the script would never be made, but it was. It was released Sept 22, 1995.
By using the seven deadly sins as the basis for justifying the killers prerogative, the films plot is definitely one of the best around, added to this amped up, excellent performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, the production comes off flawlessly, but Seven is so haunting and goes down as one of the best Thrillers of all time because of Finchers vision of a hellish New York. This world is poison and Fincher makes it seep.

The grit and grime of the crimes scenes combined with filth of the city streets, alleyways, rooftops, constantly being pounded with rain, darkness engulf even the few happy moments of the film. So much of this films beauty is in the compilation. The sets and lighting are so complex that making Seven must have been the result of a finely tuned crew, each member bulked up on their own creative genius. It is how everything, every element aligns perfectly that makes Se7en such a phenomenal filmmaking achievement.

No, I'm not talking about the acting, which was brilliant, or the ability to keep your attention, which was also amazing.  I'm just saying that when I walked out of the theater, my mood was as dark as ever in all my years --- and I'm generally an optimist!  The film is actually quite excellent in realism, and the sadistic measures that some criminals will go to realize their intentions.  Obviously, this isn't the first time Hollywood has chosen to kill off a very likable character (won't tell you, in case you haven't seen it).  But the manner in which it is done is so macabre and detestable, you have to wonder how the writers must have stayed up nights trying to figure out the most gruesome of ways.  After leaving the theater, I didn't want anything to do with this movie for many years, which unique for a movie lover like myself --- but I eventually had to come back and give credit to a very well done film.  The 5th star indicates that I ""loved it"" and that can never be the case, but it is worth four stars for the story, and another fantastic performance by Morgan Freeman, as well as good drama by Pitt.

It's classic Morgan Freeman.  Brad Pitt's character has an attitude leaving him with a two dimensional character that yells and swears alot.  It's really quite disappointing that he wasn't given more to work with.  He did an excellent job for what he had.  For anyone that hasn't previously seen this movie, I advise some parts are quite graphic.  If you don't have a strong stomach you may not want to watch it while you're sitting at a tv tray eating dinner.  Gwenyth Paltrow should be mentioned, she plays a smaller role as Brad Pitt's wife.  It's a good twist on an old theme: serial killer.  I want to reach through the screen and choke the life out of the killer myself.  You'll love it!",1384300800,,850,4.483660130718954

As a fan of breaking bad, I'm used to dark and graphic and it has occurred to me that Seven may have been a sentinel film for this genre. The acting is good, the cinematography is effective, it's a gripping film and I'm sure there are deep subtleties that I'm not smart enough to catch.
So, if you rate a film by its after effect - ie you think about it for days and have less hope for humanity, then it's a five.  I guess I still like movies that show us a little hope.",1382400000,,564,3.8956521739130436
100512,4,0790729989,"Seven is an ugly movie.  It is a horror movie written, seemingly by an out-of-work, over educated English major.

The story follows two detectives who work in a declining, rust-belt city.  They come to investigate a series of crimes perpetuated by a stereotypically, super-smart serial killer.  This killer is selecting victims based on the seven deadly sins.

There is a plot twist-the final victim is the serial killer himself killed by the wrath (one of the seven deadlies) of a detective.

Indeed the movie is ugly, and it shows a clear accounting of the decay in America in the 1990s.",1382400000,,589,4.84

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are both exellent actors and do a great and believable job portraying detectives. Gwyneth paltrow who plays Brads hot wife does an equally good job, but she has a bad habbit of losing her head from time to time. Kevin Spacey plays the highly intelligent psychopathic killer who keeps the detectives on the hunt. It's not that he just kills, it's the way he kills and the little clues he leaves behind, teasing the dynamic duo with just enough skin to keep them looking.

Some have put this film in the horror category and I suppose this could be true enough in many respects, but I don't really see it that way.  It's more in the line of say, ""Wire In The Blood"", where the sleuths are hard after a serial killer.  But where that trail ultimately leads is the real payoff for this movie.  If like me, you're a fan of this type of ""detective"" after the psycho killer type movie, I can whole-heartedly recommend Se7en as one of the best of it's type.",1381795200,,616,4.177966101694915

Everything is just a little more visible and while I understand the darkness of the original, it's hugely enhanced by the improved picture quality. An essential movie that everyone should watch.

Now this show really sums up all the characteristics of human beings and presented them in a trilled but yet down to earth manner via the Seven deadly sins - gluttony, envy, lust, pride, sloth, greed, and wrath.

The young and energetic detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) take pride of his work but still end up as a loser to the serial killer who killed his wife -- He can't control his feelings of hatred and anger (wrath) and shot dead the killer. The show is intense and I hardly move my sitting position.

Pitt and Freeman track down the killer (Spacey) using library records to identify anyone checking out books related to the case.

Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey are all excellent in this crime-mystery. This film is ranked #22 in the Top 250 Movies at IMDB and was nominated for one Oscar. The video and audio quality on the Seven 2010 BD are very good. No new content for Blu-Ray but we do get the extras ported over from the 2004 2-disc DVD. The longest featurette is 23 minutes. The big advantage here is the 4 audio commentaries otherwise the bonus content is short. This great film is sadly lacking a 90-minute documentary on the making of the movie.

100589,3,0790729989,"Why this film is so highly rated is a mystery to me, as much as I wanted to like it. At its beginning, two high-powered actors (Freeman and Pitt) deliver dialogue better suited to a couple of petulant teens, and Pitt (as Detective Mills) keeps acting like an adolescent for the rest of the film. The (mostly) rainy exterior settings make for muddy dialogue, and both Freeman's and Pitt's lines in these settings are seemingly delivered sotto voce (or it is poor audio editing). Gwyneth Paltrow (as the Pitt character's wife) is wasted. Freeman underplays his role too much. Only Kevin Spacey (as John Doe, the killer) scores in this film, and it takes an eternity for his appearance.
  The characters have no believable chemistry, no sense of emotion or even involvement. The so-called tension between Pitt and Freeman seems contrived, as does the relationship of Paltrow and Pitt.  I felt that the characters and the film developed too slowly. If ""Seven"" is considered a 'neo noir' film, the genre needs a little work and/or re-definition.",1376352000,,1040,4.8977272727272725

The film was perfectly cast.  Brad Pittl and Morgan Freeman have a fantastic chemistry and should do more movies together.  Plus you have to remember Brad Pitt was still practically an unknown when he stared in Se7en.  Interview with a Vampire came out a year prior.  It was interesting to see him when he was younger.

100655,5,0790729989,"Many have already provided plot summaries and opinions on the acting, storyline etc so I won't go there.  My reviews focus only on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.  I do have this film on Standard Def DVD but it is not a side by side comparison.  The Blu Ray I purchased does not have a book; it is a single disc blu ray.

The transfer to blu ray is about as good as it gets with a very clean transfer containing no artifacts, noticeable grain or dirt.  At no point did I see any aliasing or stair stepping either.  The colors, despite some obvious but deliberate bleach bypassing during post production, are true to life and not too deeply saturated as often films are.  There are many dark and shadowy  scenes in this film but details are not lost at all.  This is one film that was truly remastered during the process of updating it to blu ray.

The audio is equally excellent with a new DTS MA 7.1 lossless audio.  The difference between the lossless and lossy audio is significant if you have a decent home theater system.  While my system is currently a 5.1 system, the use of the discreet channels for both the front and rear stages is just plain sweet.  The soundtrack/score envelopes you throughout the film and the foley fx are not just steered towards the front stage, the rear's are also used a great deal with the sub LFE channel doing its job contributing.  This has got to be one of the most worked over audio transfers on any Blu Ray disc, really fine.

The menu for 'Seven' is the only thing that really was poor.  The contrast between what you have selected or not is barely susceptible to the eyes and I had a very difficult time navigating through the many extras.  These extras consisted of several alternate and deleted scenes, an excellent documentary on how mastering the transfer was done including the audio and color correction, commentaries, the credits, which blew me away when I first saw this film in the theaters, and so much more.  There were plenty of alternate languages to choose from if English is not your first language and subtitles are there also.

Not sure why the menu choice contrast is so poor but the blu ray of Seven is a must have for any collector and well worth upgrading to if you have it on Standard Def.

All my reviews focus only upon the quality of the transfer to blu ray .  Hope this review has been of help to you in deciding upon your purchase.

They are backed by Gweneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, who make major contributions. I am impressed by the high ratings for this film, which I agree with. I will not spoil the film for new viewers by explaining what Se7en stands for: you will discover that in the first part of the film.
I recently reviewed the David Fincher film The Game. That film takes place in San Francisco, but the closing credits of the film disclose that some of the scenes of the movie were filmed in Los Angeles.
In Se7en I am guessing that the first part of the film was filmed in Chicago, which has the El or elevated railway (see The Fugitive by Andrew Davis and starring Harrison Ford, which was filmed in Chicago). The shaking in Brad and Gweneth's apartment when the train goes by points to Chicago. The closing scenes of the film showing the power lines in the desert point to LA, which makes sense if the final cut of the film occurs where the major film studios are located.

100729,1,0790729989,"This is the most unpleasant, most over-rated movie I've ever seen.  The only thing about this movie I liked was Morgan Freeman reading the last line - and given all that came before it, and the dark ending, I'm not sure the people making the movie actually believe this world is ""worth fighting for.""

Freeman (the hardened, experienced cop) teams up with Brad Pitt (the younger cop) to track down a lunatic killer who is calmly torturing and dispatching people in horrifying ways meant to depict the seven deadly sins.  The awfulness he sees at each crime scene begins to wear on the Pitt character.

I guess I was supposed the think the end was a clever twist, but it was contrived to me.  Instead of resolving any of the interesting questions raised by the plot (how does a cop keep his hope and humanity when faced with horror every day?), the movie goes for a cheap stunt and ends abruptly.  And I don't even think the killer's stupid point was made - under the circumstances, the poor cop's reaction is temporary insanity, so I'm not sure I'd classify it as ""sinning.""

The ways in which the victims die are so disgusting and cruel that they will stay with you years after you've watched the movie.  There is no reference point of hope or even character development.  This movie is just a long, slow, hopeless, poorly-lit slog through hell.

I can enjoy a movie like Silence of the Lambs if there is some brightness (represented by the Jodie Foster character) that balances out the horror.  I can even enjoy a slasher film, like the original Halloween, because it builds up the suspense and gives us a likeable protagonist who survives the movie.  But Seven's vision of the world is dark, hopeless and sadistic.  And why would I want to wallow in that for 2 hours?",1356825600,8,1770,4.580952380952381

It is a dark transfer, however, with deep black tones and strong contrast.  I do not remember the DVD being so dark.  Whether this was the director's original vision for the film or simply a darker-than-normal transfer, I am not sure.  But it actually works, adding to the gloomy and creepy atmosphere.  Some film grain was evident in low-lit scenes, but it did not detract from the sharpness of the picture.  The sound was more problematic.  On my system, the music occasionally overpowered the dialogue.  I had to adjust the settings in order to minimize the score and bring the dialogue to the fore.  From that point on, it sounded fine.

So should a person who owns the DVD upgrade to the blu-ray?  It is a judgment call, but I would say yes for the quality of the visuals.  But you might need to adjust the sound some.",1351209600,3,946,4.461988304093567

There is a constant rain over the big city as the movie is opening. Dectective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is getting ready to retire and get away from the gloomy city. Before his retirement, he is teamed up with a young, cocky, short tempered Detective Mills (Brad Pitt). Thier first investigation is of an obese man who ate untill he exploded. As they are investigating the obese man, they get called to another murder. On the floor next to the man was the word ""Greed"" writen in blood. The detectives get a call saying that there were plastic bits in the obese man's stomach. They go back to the obese man's house to do further investigations. Somerset finds marks on the floor by the refridgerator that match the plastic pieces perfectly. He moves it back and finds 'Gluttony' writen in grease on the wall. Somerset concludes that the murders are based on the seven deadly sins, and that there were five more to go. The detectives go back to do more investigations of the greed murder. They notice that a picture is upside down on the wall. The foreinsics team find finger prints that make out the words 'help me'. They identify the fingerprints and go to the apartment of the suspect. They find a man, barely alive, who was missing his tongue and hand. The wall above him read 'sloth'. Detective Somerset decides to do some research on the seven deadly sins and goes to the library. He gets a list of all the books of the seven deadly sins and a list of people who checked them out. He comes to the conclusion that a man named John Doe may be behind it all. The detectives go to the apartment to confront Doe, but he fights against them and gets away. They investigate his apartment and find thousands of journals on his thoughts in the room. They also find many pictures of his victims. They find a picture of Mills, when he was bombarded with the press about the murders. They conclude that Doe took them meaning that he had been that close to Mills. They find a picture of a prostitute who is most likely the next victim. Sure enough, they go to a club to find a woman murdered by a deadly S&M 'toy'.They get a call about a model who was found dead with the words 'pride writen by her. She was forced to either take pills and OD or live with a scared face. Being pridefull, she chose to die. John Doe walks into the police station and turns himself in. His hands are bleeding because he would remove the skin on his fingers so he couldn't be identified. After talking with his lawyer, he asked the detectives if they could take him to the two remaining bodies. He agrees that he would confess after. Wanting the confession, the detectives agree.

First, the disc is single layer, not dual layer like most DVDs. What this means is that half way through the film, the film will stop, and you will have to eject the disc, flip it over, and insert it back into the DVD player. Strike one.

Next, the product description says it is anamorphic widescreen. It is NOT by any stretch of the imagination. The copy I received was letterbox. What this this means is that although you will receive the film in its original aspect ratio, the film had to be matted in order to fit your vintage 4:3 TV screen. So for those of us who own modern, 16:9 televisions, you will see those black bars along the top (which is normal), AND along the sides. Basically you'll be looking at a picture within a picture. It is NOT anamorphic. If any of this is confusing to you, please spend some time on wikipedia learning about it; it will pay off in the long run.

Lastly, the transfer to DVD is absolutely terrible. I've never seen a poorer transfer than this. It looks like it was copied from a bad VHS version. There was a constant grainy distortion on the left side of the picture the entire time. The sound is old and muffled. The picture quality was awful.

Despite all this, I did notice that there are several other DVD versions available aside from this cheap version I picked up. I like this film enough that I will need to pick it up eventually, so I'll try perhaps the 2 disc version, or just go straight for the Blu-ray, presuming the transfer from the analog went smoothly.",1347753600,4,1729,4.850847457627118

On the other hand, if you got through 8mm( by the same script writer-Andrew Kevin Walker) unscathed, you should be fine. Certain scenes, mostly the kill scenes, sent chills down my spine. It is a very good movie, and worth owning for the psychology behind it alone, but don't watch it after dark, that's a precaution. The story, though not original by today's standards, is chilling, to say the least, but the actors do an excellent job with their roles, Kevin Spacey as the killer does a great job being creepy, showing no remorse for his actions, thinking he was chosen by God...to kill, make sense?

100756,4,0790729989,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Seven"" starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. I found it on the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart. It's the story of a vicious sadistic serial killer. Brad Pitt plays a rookie (in this particular police division) and Morgan Freeman plays a veteran detective who is scheduled to retire in a week and both, together, are in pursuit of the insane killer as he selects his victims according to the seven deadly sins. It's a strange mixture of insanity and religious fervor, I suppose. Will they track him down and put an end to his grisly practice?

The movie is exceptionally well acted. Morgan Freeman does a convincing job, as I would expect from viewing him in other movies. The surprise was Brad Pitt. I have viewed him as a lightweight and in this movie he does just a splendid job of acting. The other characters are competent. The filming is rather good. The sound is just so-so as the background noise tends to drown out a lot of conversations.

Well, it's a quite good movie, but I didn't care for it. There's just an overwhelming amount of gore and grisly scenes. Some of the footage is just stomach churning. What' the point? If a person is dead and shown to be dead, why examine the rotting corpse in detail? I suppose in some instances it might make sense, but with this movie it went way, way over the line. Even though it's a good movie, I would not want to watch it again. Furthermore, I would advise people that if they are sensitive to really grisly scenes, perhaps this is a movie to ignore. But, it's your dime, and it's a worthy movie.

100757,3,0790729989,"It's extremely hard these days to make a truly original, engaging film about a fictitious serial killer, and ""Seven"" illustrates that point only too well. The idea of a killer using the Seven Deadly Sins as his M.O. has much potential, but the directors and producers could have been far more creative regarding who is murdered, how/why it's carried out, and so forth. All the blatant gore only serves to substitute for real intrigue; e.g., I wanted to know a bit more about Victor, the ""Sloth"" victim, but the revelations of this character and his relationship with the killer stop just as they begin to get really interesting. Freeman, as usual, plays his part very well: It's not his fault that the directors and writers made his character a rather contrived veteran cop who defies all the stereotypes. Pitt, as the mercurial but able young cop-on-the-edge, is just plain annoying. Spacey is good as the killer: He's not exactly what I expected--but then again, what exactly DID I expect?",1341532800,2,991,4.8698224852071

100772,1,0790729989,"To get it out of the way outright, David Fincher's 'Se7en' is a great movie that is head and shoulders above many that came out in 1995. The movie itself is one of my favorites (Top 10, at least), and one of the best ""journey-to-hell"" movies outside of 'Apocalypse Now', 'The Grey', and 'Valhalla Rising'. It stays with you in a way Hitchcock would be proud of both in terms of searing suspense and of course, in how little violence it actually depicts. The movie itself is as you can guess: 5 stars for me.

Which brings me to the reason why, despite feeling bad for writing a 1-star review for one of my favorite movies, I MUST write this review: I am NOT getting the product I am ordering.

Around a month ago, after having enough ""spending money"" saved to finally indulge getting the film, along with Fincher's excellent 'Fight Club', I bought the Blu Ray Book for the film. Whilst 'Fight Club' played tremendously well on my Blu Ray player, 'Se7en' didn't play well at all on 4 separate Blu Ray Players (An Insignia, a Samsung, a Panasonic, & a PS3 to be exact). Never could make it to the menu. The disc was corrupt. As such, I reported my issue to Amazon, and sent the disc back. Thankfully, I was refunded.

Given the problems I read regarding the Blu Ray book release from other reviews here on Amazon, I stayed away from the Blu Ray book and went instead for a regular Blu Ray case release of the film. And, goddamnit (!), now I'm pissed. Yet again, I'm not receiving the product I paid for. First of all, let me give you the low-down on this disc.

First of all, it is Canadian, not American. While that initial opening sentence may inspire a response of, ""that's stupid"" from a reader of this review, allow me to explain why that isn't good. While it may indeed play on my Blu Ray player, the Canadian release (in 2009) was done BEFORE the 4K Digital Scan and encoding that brought us Americans the (2010) Blu Ray book release. It simply means the picture isn't up to par in terms of picture quality, and guess what? There's even more to it than that too. The disc is 1080i, not 1080p, and even worse, the presented aspect ratio is 1.78:1, not the promised 2.40:1 Amazon advertises, and hell, not the actual aspect ratio to the film AT ALL. Outside of noticing many instances of strong digital noise, loss of detail in shadows (in pretty much every dark scene), and such on the disc as it played, of course...

Secondly, the sound only appears to be as good as the 2000 2-Disc DVD Release (which I own and watched for comparison purposes), so no significant upgrade there...

Finally, no special features AT ALL. None of the 4 Commentaries. None of the Production Design mini-documentaries. Hell, not even a trailer...

A craptastic release of one of my favorite films is what I receive as opposed to What I Ordered TWICE! Is that more than enough reason to give a 1-star review? To me, it is, because as opposed to getting what I ordered, I'm being insulted with 2 subpar releases I have to return...",1335571200,7,3013,4.467272727272727

I often times buy a movie like this when it hits a great price, but then I don't watch it until sometimes a couple of months or so after buying. So I am past Amazon's  ""return window"" and am now only due for a partial refund - and I must pay shipping for the return.

Anyway, I am rating this product, not the movie itself. The movie itself is awesome! And I love the pages in the blu ray book. Very kewl collectible stuff here. I just need a playable blu ray disc to put in the kewl case. Soon.

I did buy the single disc blu-ray (here at Amazon) in ""Used - Like New"" condition - worked perfectly, so I tossed out the non-working disc that came with the blu-ray book and popped in the working disc.

Seven stars Morgan freeman as William Somerset and Brad Pitt as David Mills, as well as Kevin Spacey as the murderer. Freeman and Pitt are Homicide investigators for a police department in a nasty crime-ridden city. The movie centers around the ""seven deadly sins"" as found in catholicism and famously, the book Dante's Inferno. Each murder they investigate centers around these seven deadly sins: Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Pride, Lust, and last but certainly not least in this movie is Envy. The movie is exciting, thrilling and very suspenseful and leaves you shocked at its conclusion. Brad Pitt and Morgan freeman are great, and Spacey only adds to the awesomeness.

""Become Vengeance, David, become Wrath..""
This is a review of the BLU RAY BOOK of SE7EN

 I was a little confused about exactly what I was getting - some reviews said 2 disks, etc.  For clarification, this is one disk with 4 Commentary features, extended scenes and alternate endings, Notebooks of ""John Doe's Writings"", Still Photographs and trailers. What is special is that the movie is in a case that opens and reads like a hardback book.  I have had NO trouble with pages falling out, but I do not try to pry the book all the way open. It is easily opened and easily read  with beautiful, glossy pages of each of the grisly scenes, actor pages, etc.  I just could not be happier with this, and got it at a wonderful price on a Gold Box Deal Day !

Oh.. and I also read some people had trouble with packaging. My ""Book"" Arrived very securely packaged with no damage whatsoever. Unfortunately, the disc did not play in ANY of the BR players I have at my house.",1325116800,3,1432,4.357142857142857

100802,5,0790729989,"David Fincher is a director who has had an amazing career with his latest highlight being THE SOCIAL NETWORK.  But a film that was praised by the critics but overlooked at the Oscars is one of his very best - SE7EN. It is amazing to believe that it came out in 1995.  It was a ratrity in its time being a true horror film while at the same time being an intense, intelligent deep psychological thriller.  The blu ray is amazing and the film certainly stands the test of time.  The movie is an absorbing, shocking and frightening tale of society, man, sin and the fine line that there is between good and evil and lives on in grand style on this glorious blu ray.  The film is dark and takes place in a city with no name.  Everything is aging, decrepid and depressing.  But the black/white levels on the blu ray are superb and the detail and clarity are amazing throughout.  Colors though subdued are still very realistic and pop naturally as do skin tones.  The crispness of the pictures adds a whole new level of intensity to the film.  And the audio is a mindblower with its 7.1 lossless DTS track.  Dialogue is strong and present and surround speakers are put to excellent use.  The disc also comes packaged in a superb digibook excellently crafted with much info on the film.  There are also tons of extras on the disc.

I highly recommend SE7EN.  This is a film that is indeed a classic.  It has standout performances by Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey.  It is also a film that is not gratuitous in its horror.  It serves a purpose and the way it is utilized makes it linger with you that much longer.  This film is so well crafted in every aspect that repeat viewings will be a must.  I remembered the whole story line when I first watched this blu ray and it in no way ruined the experience.  The knowing of things actually added to the trepidation and appreciiation of how superb the film actually is.

Luckily I received my blu ray packaged in a cardboard box but I have had the experience many have had here with other films from Amazon where bubble wrap packaging ruined a digibook.  Remember that you can rate the packaging of the shipment in your Amazon account and they do listen.  Also if it is damaged in transit Amazon will let you return it for another.  Don't let them off the hook if it was not packaged properly.  They do provide hassle free returns and stand behind their products 100% covering all return charges.",1322784000,7,2447,4.430493273542601
100803,3,0790729989,"If we're going on the basis of a movie review, the movie gets a 5. Seeing Brad Pitt play a character that isn't meant to be the ""pretty boy"" that he is portrayed as shows his versatility in acting. Morgan Freeman is all I need to say about his partner in crime, and that should be enough to tell anybody reading this review that he played a flawless character and was a great foil to Pitt's Detective Mills.

The atmosphere created in the movie, the plot, everything was brilliant. I need not go in-depth, as so many others have touched on everything I could hope to say.

I will instead talk about the ""Blu-ray Book"" that I purchased. It was a great idea, and offers interesting insight about the movie's background, the actors, and talks about the infamous ending that shook the world. While it was a great idea, what the heck?? The binding of the ""book"" is the cheapest material I have ever seen. The only way you could possibly make the book actually stay where it belongs, IN THE DVD CASE, is if you half open the pages to the point where it isn't even worth trying to read what's on their pages. By the time I got to the part about the ending (last two pages), the binding had completely fallen off, leaving me with a detachable book that I really didn't want to BE detachable. I give the book 1 star.

5 stars + 1 star/2 = 3 stars. Sorry, but I can't review this fantastic movie without saying that I am a little disappointed in their packaging.",1322438400,4,1452,4.330882352941177

100807,5,0790729989,"I watched SE7EN almost weekly back in my film school days and got to know the images very VERY well.  So you can understand the gravity of things when I say that watching SE7EN on Blu-ray is like watching it for the first time all over again.  In some cases, it's like watching a completely different film altogether.

The Blu-Ray transfer is nothing short of INCREDIBLE.  The textures and shadows almost defy belief, and the film grain--when present--is simply delicious.  What amazed me most about this transfer is HOW MUCH COLOR is in this film.  Yellows, and browns and greens that were almost nonexistent on the DVD pop out like ripe fruit on the vine.  I've been so accustomed to the muted and high-contrasted VHS/DVD editions with their near monochrome color palette that for the entire first viewing, I felt that they had digitally ALTERED the whole film like O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU.

A consequence of this is that the film is shockingly brighter than ever before; details that I never even saw before are as clear as day, and as a result, the film seems more grimy and less oppressive.  With this increased luminance, the film dates a bit...it reminds me of the PAYBACK Blu-ray (another excellent Blu-ray you need to get) where the restored color and texture deliberately evokes a specific time period.  In this case, SE7EN feels a little more like a 70s film than a post-modern 90s film, but in the end, it's still SE7EN.

There's only 2 downsides to this disc.  First, the extras are all upconverted exports from the 2000 DVD set (no HD retrospectives), which I felt should have gotten an upgrade.  Second, the blacks in a handful of scenes with almost NO ambient light at all seem devoid of texture...but at least they aren't crushed.  And this is such trivial nitpicking that I didn't even detract a full star and rounded up to five anyway.

All in all, this is a MUST OWN Blu-ray for videophiles like myself.  I really can't recommend it enough; it's up there with THE ROAD WARRIOR and SERENITY and PAYBACK.  My only regret is that the FIGHT CLUB  Blu-ray, with it's wonky grain and inconsistent shadows doesn't look HALF as good as this.",1317945600,7,2154,4.6684350132626

100839,4,0790729989,"After the abysmal failure of Alien 3, David Fincher held his breath for three years and made a new start with Se7en. His signature style of direction is all over it. Se7en is filthier than a dead stray dog at the bottom of a New Jersey toxic waste dump. It looks so miserable that people nailed to crosses seem happier.

The plot explores the extreme pitch-black side of the human psyche and was entirely the creation of one writer. Andrew Kevin Walker, a former Tower Records employee, conceived, in hell, a heinous story of a serial killer who offs his victims in the style of the Seven Deadly Sins. What was he smoking when he came up with that idea? Brad Pitt plays David Mills, an arrogant, over-confident, semi-experienced detective who is way ahead of himself. He uproots from a decent precinct, dragging his suffering wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) with him, to transfer to the worst in town - an unnamed, rainier-than-Glasgow Los Angeles - for no other reason than ""to make a difference"". Good luck.

Morgan Freeman is William Somerset, the most jaded and world-weary cop on the force. He only has a few days with Mills before retiring to a simple life in the country. Mills could learn a lot from him, and if he had any sense, he would. Sadly, this does not happen.

In Fight Club, Fincher exposed the rotten underbelly of a free society, the seedy flipside of American culture that most people pretend doesn't exist. Somerset says the only way to deal with a world this bad is to be apathetic, the polar opposite to Mill's belief that he can make the world a better place.

Few scripts make for good reading, but Andrew Kevin Walker's writing is one of the film's many strengths. He explored dark, character-driven horror/drama in shockers such as Brainscan and 8mm, but this is the meanest. The irony of each victims' death is made entirely justified by the killer's logic behind the madness. Of course, he does not believe he is insane. Just the world he lives in. Haven't you ever felt like that? It is important for such movies to have an atmosphere and Se7en is so rank that you can smell it. Pitt and Freeman deliver great performances, although Pitt should learn to breathe through his nose and not have constantly pursed lips. It becomes quite annoying.

Se7en is definitely the film that kick-started Fincher's career. Had he made The Game right after Alien 3, there would have been no Fight Club, Panic Room, or Social Network.

For that tiny minority who knows nothing of the film it's high time you checked it out. Even if you don't enjoy, you cannot deny its power and effect.

The Blu Ray looks brilliant in 1080p 2.35:1 widescreen with DTS HD-MA sound. Plenty of grimy extras are included.",1299974400,,2707,4.662473794549266

Since the camera original is a high speed film and bleach bypassed, there is a lot of film grain, and I feel the same grain is pretty prevalent in the DVD version of the film.  What I am trying to say is, though it IS a step up from DVD, the grainy quality is still there so viewers should not expect a ""flawless"" and crisp image.  Let me tell you though, the colors in this film you're not gonna get with digital.  The extras are good, although they're pretty much the same as the DVD extras.

The sound mix has absolutely changed from the DVD version.  Though I am not sure I like it.  The surround sound seems to have improved greatly, but a lot of the levels seem off to me.  While I understand everyone's system may vary and may be calibrated differently... some of the loud and bassy sounds (such as the thunder right before the opening sequence) WAY overpowered the otherwise more silent dialogue and city ambiance that is featured in the opening sequence.  (the sound mix does improve bringing up some of those sounds in certain scenes, which is nice)

Now the ""book"" part... Given that Dr. Strangelove is also packaged as a ""Blu-Ray Book"" I wasn't completely sold on the idea.  Seemed gimmicky to me, and a waste of paper.  I will say that though I still feel the Seven BDB is the same, it is really nicely printed.  The color paper used is of a high quality (almost a mylar texture) with different coatings so there is matte with gloss combined.  Maybe that's hard to picture.  In essence, the pages are really nice.  The content talks briefly about the picture, then theres a spread dedicated each to Pitt, Freeman, Platrow, and Fincher that simply goes into their bio's.  Waste!

I'm not at all a fan of the BD books, and would rather have a jewel case (as ugly as they can be) but I am surprised that Fincher didn't make another nice digipack as he did for Social Network (which is packaged beautifully, I might add)  Perhaps this is an ideal item for a gift for someone that hasn't seen the film... I don't know.  The disc doesn't disappoint, but the packaging is whatever.  At least they could have removed the butt-ugly blue bar on the cover!",1296864000,4,2511,4.432314410480349
100842,1,0790729989,"I saw this movie a couple times, and I liked it as a scary movie on a rainy day or whatever.... it's just that, I know too many people who take this stuff seriously. It's filled with Christian or more specifically Catholic, mythology - the seven deadly ""sins"" Lust, Vanity, Gluttony, Pride, Wrath, Sloth and Greed. It's basically a vigilante who goes around killing people in horrific manners as a punishment for their ""sins."" It has a surprise ending which was cleverly thought out more or less, but innocents suffered at this guy's hands and the plot doesn't really make sense. In no way does it make moral sense. First of all, Catholics practice child sacrifice and torture and enslave women, which does not qualify them as the best moral judges. The bible in itself is tyrannical and abusive, as well as chock full of lunacy - not the reasoned judge I'd want making decisions on my moral life that's for sure.

Also this guy does not really mete out justice. A person guilty of gluttony, sloth or vanity, does not deserve death, not even in the Catholic church and they loooove to kill and torture people. Usually, you go to confession and say a Hail Mary or two. I think the psycho in this movie was just looking for an excuse to kill people and get his pic in the paper, or whatever, and con a bunch of suckers into thinking he was some underground hero instead of what he was - a cruel psychotic, not-very-bright, jerk. Actually I have a lot of compassion for people who mess up in life, controlling the worst of your nature is difficult, most people mess up often on all counts - and Catholics can be overly critical - not to mention psychotic - about details anyway. You really have to know a person's whole life to know what they are. Maybe that guy was injured and gained weight because he couldn't move around very well, maybe the guy having sex was lonely and frightened and needed physical contact... who knows? You can't judge people on an outward, shallow look-over of their lives. If you want to help people out with their struggles for virtue why not invite the gluttony guy out to walk with you, or ask the lustful guy what intimate relationships mean to him, or why he's lonely or out of control? Maybe they're looking for help, virtue is it's own reward and all that - and lack of it is it's own justice in many ways.

Many Classical books are quoted and used in the movie (The Merchant of Venice (Shakespeare), The Divine Comedy (Dante Alighieri), Canterbury tales (Chauncer), Paradise Lost (Milton), which makes it a highly cerebral film.

I remember when this played in theaters it so un-nerved me that I went back the next day to see it again. On second viewing it occurred to that the 'city,' which is a major part of the movie is un-named; it is a horrid place and I thought that Fincher did not want to associate it with any 'real' city; in the special features in this new disc that is exactly what happened.

I've been very impressed with Fincher ever since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-3-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00012FXB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien 3 (Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;(Note: NOT the 114 minute theatrical release but the 155 minute version Fincher delivered to the studio that then ruined it. The 'good' version is, I think, on this collector's edition, in the so-called 'Quadrilogy' and in the new Blu Ray, properly named, 'Alien Anthology'). Anyway, sorry for the rant, Fincher has gone on to make some of the classic films of the past few years.

The special features on this release are alright, nothing really special, but worth the extra money. Kevin Spacey's performance is down right chilling. An excellent buy.

Now for a gripe at Amazon. Why do they combine all reviews of a movie no matter which version you are thinking of buying? Some of the negative reviews here relate to a poorly done transfer for the European market. Others relate to other editions. It isn't just this movie, it's all reviews on a movie, book, product, no matter which version are lumped. I recently bought a Kindle book that had very negative reviews due to a bad tech transfer; the author/publisher had fixed all the problems and then gone through all the negative reviews one at a time to explain that they had been fixed. Why not just have Amazon delete those or clearly show they relate to another version?

100881,4,0790729989,"Seven is one of the best cinematic thrillers, especially of the last few decades - almost a blueprint of how one should be. Where nearly all of them fail, becoming clichd, predictable, and implausible, it succeeds. It continuously defies expectations - in a good way -, subtly making us think it is going one way then going another. This quickly becomes clear, as the opening premise seems distinctly hackneyed - a veteran, retiring detective gets a cocky upstart partner for his last case, which turns out to be by far their most difficult. This has been done so many times that it hurts, but this is something different. What could have easily been unbearably banal turns out to be surprisingly and refreshingly interesting, as the relationship develops with unexpected subtlety.

What really makes Seven stand out from all the films with similar premises, though, is the villain - easily the most disturbing cinematic killer since The Silence of the Lambs. His methods and motives are unusual and deeply frightening - painstakingly methodical and sadistic. Even more interestingly, he is deeply, self-righteously, and thus hypocritically religious and plans his mayhem accordingly.

This brings up one of the film's true strengths - Andrew Kevin Walker's script. One of the freshest screenplays in modern film, it continually surprises without being contrived. Walker's work is really quite tight; those looking for plot holes will have an unusually hard time, and any that can be found are minor. The dialogue is also above average. Having the killer base his murders - nay, his whole existence - on the seven deadly sins is a novel and perversely fascinating concept. More importantly, it leads to many theological elements and aspects of religious history throughout all aspects of the movie. One would be very hard-pressed to find a thriller where such weighty issues are so seamlessly integral to the plot. Those unfamiliar with such elements will learn much, especially as the script fortunately never becomes preachy or overly didactic. Even more impressive are the litany of literary references. Nearly every movie seems to throw in a Shakespeare reference or something to seem intelligent, but this is actually well done. There are about as many allusions as a mainstream film can get away with, and in contrast to nearly every movie that tries to do such a thing even with far less ambition, it never seems forced. The allusions are important to the plot and spice up the dialogue while giving viewers some substantial meat to chew between all the suspense.

This raises an important question - just how good is the script? How serious and how ambitious? That Seven currently ranks #27 on the Internet Movie Database's list of the 250 Best Films of All-Time strongly suggests many see far more than just a thriller. It is certainly true that Seven raises numerous important issues, from theological niceties to practical aspects of crime fighting. It also dramatizes many important themes, including modern crime, urban decay, institutional and individual responsibility toward society, apathy vs. activism, youth vs. age, experience vs. emotion, etc. Some weighty philosophical issues are even brought up and, more to the point, we see much about the often vast gap between theory and practice. Seven vividly dramatizes the ticklish problem of applying hard-won wisdom to the modern world's cold reality. Most noteworthy to me is the acidic religious criticism that nearly everyone, including the film's biggest fans, seems to have missed. Seven is a vicious shot at hypocritical religious self-righteousness and does much to expose Christianity, especially its historical bases, as hollow. If the many who have seen this film - especially the many who seem to think it a masterpiece - realized this, the world might have been slightly bettered. Unfortunately, as all too often in such cases, it has not even been ignored but simply gone unseen.

The regrettable situation has undoubtedly arisen because the movie is essentially a thriller; heavier elements work within this framework rather than the reverse. Many go into it expecting a thriller and see just that - and it is quite good on such terms. However, this can easily make them fail to see the weightier elements. Those alive to them will quickly see that, while they move the film above a mere thriller, the genre's inherent limitations keep it from true greatness. There is a sense, then, in which Seven is overrated. It is certainly not one of the thirty greatest films, and I am unable to imagine how it acquired such a status. This is unfortunate, really, because it is very good on its own terms and more than respectable per se; it would truly be a shame if people were disappointed because they expected a masterwork. If the more substantial elements were actually the core and all thriller conventions were dropped, this could truly be a masterpiece. That it limits itself in this way should not necessarily be held against it; Seven is about as good as a film can be that is not trying for true mastery. This may disappoint those looking for the transcendentally great, but the discerning among those who expect only a thriller may well be pleasantly surprised.

The daringly dark ending is the clearest sign of how Seven refuses to limit itself to thriller conventions entirely. An essentially happy conclusion is one of the main thriller conventions, something most viewers want and expect. No matter how many close scrapes protagonists go through, they are supposed to triumph. Seven crushes this clich with a highly pessimistic ending that is gut-wrenchingly shocking yet inevitable; it refrains from a cheap twist and is certainly without trite sentimentality. It is sad but unsurprising that New Line wanted to change this. Several alternate endings were proposed, all inferior mainly because they made the players act out of character or otherwise introduced implausibility. The cast and crew fought for the original ending and thankfully won; Seven's status as something more than thriller would be highly compromised without it.

Masterpiece or not, several Seven aspects are clearly excellent. The most obvious is the acting. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman do a thorough job of portraying the detectives and work well together. Some have questioned the former's job, especially toward the end, but their real problem seems to be with the character. One may not like Mills or his behavior, but this is hardly the fault of Pitt, who is more than adequate. Freeman meanwhile performs with his usual excellence, vividly portraying a character with a lot of depth and even somehow managing to make him very likable. He is almost like an African American Sherlock Holmes. However, Kevin Spacey's as the villain is the true highlight. It is doubtful that anyone else could have pulled off such a brilliant portrayal. His John Doe is fully detestable - twisted, vain, hypocritical, and more - yet we can see the great, if perverse, intellect and talent behind the evil. Spacey pushed to have his name kept from the opening credits, and his late appearance is indeed exhilarating. It was all the more notable given his recent, Oscar-winning role as a villain in The Usual Suspects. That was a rightly proclaimed performance, but this is even better - one of the more astonishing depictions in recent memory. As for Gwyneth Paltrow's small role, I have heard that she was not interested in it and had to be convinced to take it. I can see why; she is simply not believable as a fifth grade teacher and worried wife/expectant mother. It is perhaps not her fault exactly; she is who she is and was wrongly cast. One can understand why Pitt would want his then-girlfriend to play his wife, but a better choice could clearly have been made. However, this inadequate performance in a minor role does little to mar what is otherwise an excellently acted picture.

Director David Fincher does a good job in all areas, particularly cinematography. Seven is very atmospheric without resorting to film noir clichs; the ambiance is so strong that much of what would normally need to be explicated in dialogue can remain unsaid. Fincher keeps the suspense riding high, milking the mystery for drama but not letting it go dry. The film seems to have a slow start, but we soon see this is deliberate and right. The various red herrings are also well-done - effective without being cheap. Finally, the music is commendable and does a good job of setting the mood. It is easy to see why this made Fincher's name as a director.

In summary, Seven is at least worth a rental to those who still have not seen it. As for which edition to buy, the single disc version is truly bare bones. Anyone wanting extras should seek out the various expanded editions, but those who just want a permanent copy will be fine with the single disc, as it does not cost much more than a rental. Whichever route one chooses, the film comes quite highly recommended.",1263340800,,9009,4.9774236387782205

Writer: Andrew Kevin Walker
Starring: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey

This film is a great example of how every aspect of film making can come together to create a stellar drama in a brilliant and visceral world. David Fincher directs a stellar cast in this modern crime classic.

Big city detectives Mills (Pitt) and Somerset (Freeman) find themselves investigating a serial killer who chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins.

I think this is David Fincher's best film. While the acting comes up just short of perfection (with the obvious exception of Spacey, who is brilliant in what little screen time he has), the story and visual feel of this movie will keep you ensnared the entire time. I especially enjoyed the non-traditional aspects of the character development. Many of the characters could easily have devolved into predictable stereotypes, good cop/bad cop, crazy killer, etc. However, so many scenes and characters evolved differently than you would expect, but still very logical. It's as if to say ""we know how you would expect this to go, but here is an alternative. Didn't expect that, did you?"" The unpredictability of the story is the hook that won't let you go.

Between scenes of brutal and often horrifying killings and witty dialogue, the world of Se7en had me from start to finish. And speaking of finishes (and without giving anything away), the ending hit me in the gut with a sledgehammer. I never saw it coming. I would rank the final scene of Se7en right up there with the best of them. It's as shocking as it is brilliant.

100888,5,0790729989,"I first seen this movie with one of my aunts, and this is probably the second best maniac thriller ever made.

I can't dismiss ""Se7en"" completely, but I did find it overrated. It's been praised often and by many. Sure, it's atmospheric and gruesome, but so is most familys' junk drawer.

Rain looks good in movies. It enhances the mood in film noir, in romance, in horror, in suspense, and in detective tales. But this is ridiculous excess. In a constantly rainy metropolis, we learn about this madman who has been inspired by the seven deadly sins. This detective yarn becomes predictable as it progresses. By the ending you can figure out what's about to go down.

I do wish the screenplay was better; the relationship between the two main characters could have been really well defined, even witty and clever. Instead we get the 'same-old same-old' detective partners: wise one and reckless one. It's been done a bajillion times.

Of course the production design was fairly effective-- but you expect that in a film like this anyway (and style doesn't win me over much if the story doesn't enthrall me at all). And the score by Howard Shore was good. But overall this is the sort of thriller that I see once and then have no wish to view again. It just didn't live up to the praise, for me personally.

For each of the Seven Deadly Sins, there is a victim who symbolizes that evil. Traditionally, the seven sins have counterpart virtues that overcome the sin and balance the individual. The killer begins with GLUTTONY and works his way through SLOTH, ENVY, GREED, and PRIDE. The older detective (Freeman) is self-disciplined and holds his anger in check when the killer becomes the symbol of LUST while the younger Man (Pitt) gives in to WRATH.  With this film as many others, the investigators become the targets, and even though the bad guy gets his, he gets in a big blow on the young and inexperienced detective.

100944,4,0790729989,"This film certainly does have tremendous impact. With it's intelligent dialoge, rapid pacing and shocking revelations, you can't help but be enthralled. A serial killer leaves a very gruesome trail of symbolic murders based on the Seven Deadly Sins that two detectives follow and try to piece together like a puzzle. After five of the murders are done, the killer turns himself in with two more murders to go that end up pointing to two of the least likely of victims.

This is not your typical serial killer slasher film. The killer (John Doe brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey) is not motivated by sexual gratification or hatred towards women or a mother obsession of any kind. He feels that he is a teacher of some sorts teaching society about it's own apathetic ways that we simply don't care what we do to ourselves and to each other. We don't see the murders take place, only the aftermath and the messages he leaves at each scene for our two detectives to decipher. He uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his weapons of choice ""turning the sin against the sinner"". Glutony is represented by an obese man forced to eat spagetti at gun-point until he bursts over a period of twelve hours. Greed is carried out by forcing an infamous defense lawyer to cut exactly one pound of his own flesh resulting in his bleeding to death. Sloth is done by keeping a known drug dealer and pedophile bed ridden with constant drug ingestions for exactly one year (the only victim who actually survives, but in a vegitated state). Lust is done with a prostitute who's client is forced to penetrate her with a strap-on artificial penis with a jagged blade on the end. Pride ends up with a wealthy fashion model disfigured (cut off her nose to spite her face) and given a choice to either call for help or committ suicide (which she does). The last two (Envy and Rath) result in the climatic twist of the plot that I won't reveal.

Detectives Somerset and Mills (equally played well by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt respectively) are at opposite ends with each other. Somerset is a seasoned, wise but embittered veteran getting ready for retirement after 34 years on the force. He is worn down from all the years of witnessing society's degradation of itself and ""embracing apathy as a virtue"", to quote himself. His sense of duty has faded. Mills, on the other hand, is a young idealist and somewhat an optimist feeling that there is worth to his work and that he can make a difference. This can interpreted as to just what Somerset was in his early days on the force. Both take different approaches to their jobs where Somerset takes the slow, meticulus and methodical approach. Mills takes the more agressive and gungh-ho approach. But despite these differences, they end up complimenting each other. Gwyneth Paltrow has a small but key role as Mills young wife with an interesting sub-plot. She is saddened and somewhat losing hope with her husband's work environment but trying desperately to hold on to her fading optimism.

Great writing, acting and full of surprises make this a real thinking man's detective thriller. But despite of this, I can't help but gripe over David Fincher's over-the-top directing. This isn't film noir, it's film murkey! He takes grimness to such an extreme to where it just isn't very realistic. Why is it that at almost every crime scene, the detectives need flashlights? Seems that overhead lighting has become obsolete in this world. And does it always have to rain in buckets? I don't deny Fincher's talent as an upcoming director here (this was only his second feature), but sometimes a little restraint is needed.

All in all, this film certainly made a mark and even influenced later disturbing thrillers like the inferior Saw series (which is borderline rip-off!) But don't expect a happy ending here, this film will make you think and wince as well.",1210982400,3,3873,4.758928571428571
100945,5,0790729989,"Seven is a brillant and creepy film from director David Fincher. This is probably Fincher's best film, his movies lately haven't been that good (Zodiac and Panic Room).

Kevin Spacey is flawless as a serial killer who toys with Pitt's character right up 'til the very end. I highly recommend this psychological thriller, enjoy!",1209772800,,513,4.711111111111111
100946,5,0790729989,"David Fincher is probably one of the greatest directors we have working today.  He has a distinct style and presence with each of his films that goes unmatched by anyone else in the business.  Even his weaker fare like `Panic Room' still has such sharp and masterful texture to it; you can't help but admire his talent.  `Se7en' most definitely is his finest film; a true testament to his marvelous gift.  Hailed as the greatest crime thriller since `The Silence of the Lamb', `Se7en' may very well be the greatest crime thriller period.  Fincher touch elevates this gritty and quite disturbing picture even past the likes of `...Silence...' and creates something never before seen or experienced.  `Se7en' digs deep beneath the skin and festers.

In `Se7en' Fincher takes us into the heart of sin; deadly sin for that matter.  The film focuses on two detectives, Mills and Somerset, as they track down a serial killer stalking their city.  Somerset is about to retire while Mills is going to be his replacement.  The two of them don't necessarily see eye-to-eye on the outset, but their involvement in the case brings them closer together.  The killer, who for the most part remains out of sight, strings along these detectives in an elaborate game of cat-and-mouse, leading up to the most shocking of conclusions in cinematic history (yes, the ending is a real mind-blower).

As the films title would suggest, this `killer' strikes those involved in one of the seven deadly sins, namely gluttony, greed, lust, envy, sloth, wrath and vanity.  This premise leads for some extremely creative, not to mention spine chilling, crime scenes put on film.

The benefit to such an intricate and perverse premise is that it allows morality to have a role in the growth of the film.  As the killer strikes time and time again we see the filth of society being victimized; the same type of individuals that do their fare share of victimizing.  The motives and views of the killer are made to take front and center as he expresses his `faith' in savage ways.  `Se7en' is smart enough to give the audience a reason to be truly scared.  Rather than having a lunatic randomly stalking and murdering hot young girls, Fincher and crew have created a killer who has a distinct target, a target that incorporates each and every living breathing human.

We all sin; don't we?

One thing that impressed me from the very beginning was the creativity and originality that went into the script.  The film is very fresh, especially when you consider the recycled garbage that gets passed around in this particular film genre these days.  It seems that each and every `horror' director out there wants to use the same clichd sequences within their films to try and elicit some sort of fearful reaction from the audience.  Not so with `Se7en'.  Fincher has masterfully crafted a film that uses its head; that creates a mood and seeps slowly yet savagely into the viewers mind and starts to pick away at their sanity from the inside out.

That mood is perfectly matched by the brilliant performances captured on screen.  Morgan Freeman delivers a very controlled and mannered performance as the wise Detective Somerset.  His performance is complemented beautifully by Brad Pitt's effortless portrayal of the gruff Detective Mills.  Pitt, who is often considered a pretty boy, really digs down and draws out perfection from this character.  Pitt, like DiCaprio, is one of those actors cursed by the pretty stick, but he has equally proven himself a dedicated and talented actor.  Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful as Mill's doting wife Tracy; but it is one other man who really steals the show.  Kevin Spacey has never been better in my humble opinion.  As `John Doe' he fleshes out pure terror.  His final frames are those `hold your breath' frames, where time stops and blood runs cold and everything around you begins to crush inward.

`Se7en', as you can tell, is one of my favorite films.  The quote-unquote `horror' genre all too often suffers from unoriginality and a total lack of imagination.  `Se7en' is the supreme antidote.  It is gritty, disturbing and haunting to the core.  Quote honestly, if you are looking for an effective crime thriller then there is no better place to go.",1208304000,7,4258,4.8625

100968,4,0790729989,"With the likes of SAW, HOSTEL, and other recent ""torture"" horror films, the visceral moments in SE7EN seem a little tamer now. This is, by the way, not to say that SE7EN falls in that exploitative genre. Rather, SE7EN is a taut and frightening psychological thriller, which also happens to be intelligent and articulate. In its sensibilities, this film is actually closer to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>. And the knockout acting doesn't exactly hurt.

In an anonymous city reeking of gloom and corruptness, a serial killer makes his opening move, as he tortures and murders a gluttonous man. Veteran Homicide Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) lands the case, but being mere days away from retirement, wants no part of it, intuiting that this one has the potential to be very, very ugly and messy. It soon becomes disturbingly clear that the killer is using the theme of the seven deadly sins to frame his gruesome murders. And, contrary to his instincts, the reluctant Somerset finds himself being drawn into the case and incidentally into mentoring fledgling Homicide Detective (and his eventual replacement) David Mills (Brad Pitt). But even Somerset's long experience in the field and Mills' enthusiasm won't prepare them for the shocking depravity and grisly inventiveness of this driven, demented killer. As Somerset warns his young partner, ""You know this isn't gonna have a happy ending."" And it doesn't.

SE7EN, coming out in 1995, is intense and it's relentlessly dark - dark in its cinematic look and in its estimation of the human condition. Not only is the killer steeped in his grim, homicidal philosophies, but the film also showcases a protagonist whose cynicism and world-weariness are empathically conveyed. In such morbid light, the film's only sweet ray of sunshine, which is Gwyneth Paltrow's Tracy (Mill's wife), doesn't even come close to making a dent in the pervading bleakness. And, in this unnamed city, it seems to be always drizzling. SE7EN is filmed in a gritty style, with the interiors mostly shot in gloomy and cramped quarters, which builds on that claustrophobic atmosphere. The murders themselves are baroque and explicit, scoring well on the gross out scale. The victims of gluttony and sloth are particularly chilling.

Although a gripping thriller, it's not really that action-packed. There's one extended chase scene, but, else, the film focuses on the detectives' cerebral pursuit of clues. This also leaves ample opportunity for the two leads to interact and flex their acting muscles. Morgan Freeman, universally regarded as one hell of an actor, is again pitch perfect. His character of William Somerset, reserved, meticulous yet intuitive, contrasts nicely with Pitt's brash, impetuous, and rumpled-wardrobed David Mills. I'm thinking it was probably around this time that Brad Pitt began to be recognized as an actual actor, and beyond his studly looks. His very next film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/12-Monkeys-Special-Edition/dp/B0007PALZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">12 Monkeys (Special Edition)</a>, would garner him an Oscar nomination. But, here, Pitt benefits tremendously from being partnered with the low-key yet magnetic Morgan Freeman. As always, it's a real pleasure watching Mr. Freeman do justice to his scenes and to his dialogue. And, even when not reciting his lines, he continues to exude this quiet, commanding presence. I've always loved Morgan Freeman, as far back as when I first saw him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glory-Special-Edition/dp/B000051YMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glory (Special Edition)</a>.

There's another topnotch actor here, and that's Kevin Spacey, who turns in another eerie and effective performance as the creepy madman, John Doe. When he makes his speech near the end, as he strives to justify his actions to Somerset and Mills, he's convincing enough that there's a half-stutter of a second where you actually think he's making sense. Meanwhile, Gwyneth Paltrow isn't in this one a lot, but she lights up the screen whenever she is. Too, her role becomes very critical to the film's resolution.

Let's be clear about this, the two detectives, dogged and clever as they may be, are still no match for John Doe. Most of the film has them reacting and running in circles, and even reduced to deciphering the works of Chaucer and Dante (Somerset reads the real stuff, Mills gets his hands on the Cliff Notes). SE7EN tantalizes you with just how devious and creative and ruthless the killer is, and with how desperate and behind the game the detectives really are. Even when Somerset's wild hunch pays off - a hunch hinging on the FBI's keeping tabs on library systems - it's such an unbelievably long shot that you shake your head at the far-fetchedness of it all. It does pay off, but then John Doe still manages to get away (and simultaneously beat the snot out of Mills). When the bad guy is at last apprehended, it's not any of Somerset and Mills's doing as much as John Doe allowing himself to be captured, but for his own very sick reasons. The only negative I can come up with for this film is that I did expect more of the ending, which seemed a bit abrupt and almost anticlimactic. There's a twist at the end, yes, which is suppposed to be shocking. But this twist didn't shock as much as sadden me. In the end SE7EN manages to cling fast to its dark sentiments, leaving its audience as tired and jaded as its world-weary protagonist. This is an excellent movie, but now I'm in search of a shower and ice cream and a sunny beach with volleyball and beautiful women, and maybe a hug from my folks. Just to remind me that there are still the good things in life.",1207440000,7,5967,5.370726495726496

100970,4,0790729989,"As a rule, I have a high tolerance for violence and gore in movies, but this one squicked even me. It's certainly the most nightmare-inducing film I've seen recently. The setting is very noir, a dark and rainy unnamed city, in which the youngish Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is replacing Det. Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who is about to retire. Then a series of horrific murders begins -- from which the camera never pans away -- themed on the Seven Deadly sins, and there's a lot of chasing about in alleys and tenements. The serial killer, John Doe, is played by Kevin Spacey, who can be a little creepy even when he's not playing a role.

[John Milton, Paradise Lost, Book II. Line 432]

""Seven deadly sins, seven ways to die"" is the tagline for this intense psychological thriller directed by David Fincher:

~ Detective Sergeant Mills [Brad Pitt] is set to replace Detective Lieutenant Somerset [Morgan Freeman], a world-weary cop retiring after years on the force. Somerset can see no end to the harrowing crimes he has witnessed, the sickness that is the City. Dealing with murder, rape, abuse, and poverty has become the Lieutenant's life and he now hopes for some small shred of peace. Mills, on the other hand, is new to the city; he is arrogant and brash, having little time for Somerset's thoughtful and analytical techniques.

As retirement beckons, so a new spate of killings begin. Like it or not, Somerset is given the investigation by the Captain [R Lee Ermey] while Mills is put on a different case. The murders are soon linked to the same killer - a twisted genius who chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins in Dante Alighieri's 'The Divine Comedy' - and Mills and Somerset are paired together once more.

Despite their clash of personalities Mills and Somerset strike up a good partnership, Somerset's introspectiveness and Mills's self-confidence turning out to be a useful combination. Each one learns a lot from the other; indeed, Mills's wife [Gwyneth Paltrow] thinks Somerset is a good influence on the husband she is rapidly growing concerned about.

It soon becomes apparent that the 'sins' killer is playing a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the detectives, enjoying watching them either stumble or succeed at every turn in the case ... while he continues to kill according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, lust. They must stop him before he can finish his murder spree and most probably disappear forever ~

Se7en is not only the most accomplished film by David Fincher [Zodiac] but almost certainly - from a writing and directing viewpoint - the best psychological thriller in the history of film and television. There are none of the stereotypical clich&eacute;s found in countless thrillers of violence, no room for the predictable, for the viewer is kept constantly in the dark until the very end. And the climax is both ferocious and awe-striking ... for once Hollywood kept the outcome a secret until the day of release, not an easy thing to do.

Whatever vision Andrew Kevin Walker had before he took his script to screenwriter David Koepp [Secret Window] was ultimately realized once in the hands of David Fincher. Fincher's dark and rain-driven sewer, his city of sins, has yet to be matched on film. His choice of cast was spot-on. Se7en is a true classic, crossing genres like crime, horror, thriller and police procedural ... dark and moody, harrowing and painful, Se7en will appeal to the darker side within us all.

100976,3,0790729989,"Upon a first viewing (years ago) ""Se7en"" impressed for the simple reason that it didn't have a happy ending.  It was the only logical ending there could be, after such a brutal two-hour wallow in the sludgy undergrowth of human nature.

However, with age, and maybe even some spiritual growth, I've come to realize that the ending is actually not tragic, that it, in fact, shows God's plan for mankind working on this deep, tectonic plate level.  And further, that it is an even better movie for that reason.

In ""Seven,"" everyone is a sinner - even Kevin Spacey's character (whose sin is envy).  Everyone that is, save Morgan Freeman's character - we'll come back to him a little later.  The wife of Brad Pitt's young, macho detective (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) is this sort of Eve-like creation.  All innocence on the outside, but working a pretty serious deception on her husband - she's not telling Pitt's character that she's pregnant.  Her reasoning (Milton's take on ""Eve"") is a bit soft-headed; something about ""how horrible the world is""; you get the feeling she's about back out of it all, and abort the kid, possibly.  Or at least, that she's reserved that option.

If Paltrow is Eve, Pitt is Adam - a lumpen proletariat malcontent of an Adam, talking out of the side of his mouth, bruised-up, leading with his chin, and gullible as heck.  Again, like Milton's Adam, who is a bit of simpleton gardener type, led around by the nose by his lubricious wife.

Spacey's character is the Devil; constantly cross-examining and impeaching Adam/Pitt, baiting him, even.  He gets the better of Pitt's character in their one physical encounter, which is ridiculous when you consider the relative bulk of the two men (Spacey vs. Pitt) but perfectly logical when you're attuned to their symbolic functions.  Of course Adam's not going to get the better of Satan.

So, Spacey/Satan gets Pitt/Adam to sin in the penultimate scene of the movie, after admitting his own sin (in language that actually mirrors Milton's characterization of Satan - ""I envy your normal life""; in ""Paradise Lost"", the devil's reaction to his first sight of Adam and Eve goes something like ""[Adam] pressed her matron lip/With kisses pure: aside the Devil turned/For envy, yet with jealous leer malign/Eyed them askance. . .""  (Book IV 501-504).

The end of the movie is not an unhappy one, then, because it recapitulates the ""felix culpa"" (the ""happy fall"") of Eden.  That is, Pitt/Adam's sin of anger is a sin, but it is at least a fruitful one, because now, God will redeem the world.  How is this played in ""Seven""?  In the very next scene, Morgan Freeman hovers over the lost Adam, getting assurances from the D.A. that ""we'll do everything we can for him.""

And then, Freeman's last, telling, line of dialogue:

  The D.A.:  ""Where will you be?""

  Freeman:  ""Around.  I'll be around.""

Nice word that ""around"", resonant as it with suggestions of circularity, return.  Obviously Freeman's character will be around.  He is God; he's always there, watching over our (Adam's) shoulder.  God ""will be around"" -- Christ will come ""around"" and fish our chestnuts out.

Think of that climactic scene, the stand-off between Spacey and Pitt.  What does Freeman do?  He does exactly what God does.  He consoles, he reassures, he provides, but he does not force Pitt's hand - he says, ""Give me the gun.  He wants you to do this.  If you kill him, he wins.""  He even makes the decision that Pitt should see the contents of the box - because otherwise Pitt wouldn't be exercising free will, would he?  He wouldn't know all the facts - simili modo, God tells Adam and Eve exactly what the rules are (""don't eat of that tree"").

The scene is perhaps most perfect demonstration of the Augustinian paradox on film ever - of course you have free will, and of course God can force your hand towards the good.  But he won't.  And he'll be there afterwards for you, even if you do sin.  Always.  ""He'll be around. """,1188777600,,3973,4.741228070175438

Everything about this movie flows effortlessly, the mood of the film, the acting is superb, and the ending couldn't have been better. Anyone who has not seen this movie is doing themselves a disfavor. David Fincher is a talented director, his vision and direction for this film is untouchable, ingenious, and  exquisitely clever. The story unfolds like a blanket, as far as thriller's go this is the best one I've ever seen. The screenplay is well-written, and in my opinion should've been nominated for an Academy Award, along with the movie itself.

The casting for the film couldn't have been assembled no better. Morgan Freeman... well its Morgan Freeman, what can you say but living legend. Brad Pitt, who I am not a big fan of, outdid himself in this movie, this one of his best roles. Even If I tried I couldn't find not one thing bad about this movie. Kevin Spacey crafts the role as John Doe to perfection. He was only in the movie for about 20 -25 minutes, and boy did he make his presence known.

This movie was well formulated and the cast well-chosen.  Brad Pitt is perfect in the role of the young detective who wears his emotions on his sleeve, while Morgan Freeman is wonderful as the older, more patient but cynical mentor who tries to help the younger man.

Kevin Spacey plays the part of the insane killer who is on a misguided mission to save mankind from sin, murdering sinners to do so.  He's great in this role, also, leading the detectives from one bloody, gory crime scene to another and another, until he turns the tables on them in a surprise move.

The ending, though shocking and unexpected, is a brilliant piece of writing, but it ruined the movie for me.  I not only gasped at the ending, I cried for both detectives.  The movie left me craving a happier, more equitable kind of justice, so I had to lower my rating to 4-star, despite the extremely high-caliber of the acting and the screenplay.

100991,5,0790729989,"Se7en is one of the best thrillers ever made, and if 12 years later you still haven't seen it then you have missed a fantastic film.

Its a simple story - two detectives start investigating a series of murders that increasingly seem to relate to the seven deadly sins - Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Pride, Lust, Envy and Wrath. As the film progresses the film gets darker and darker, and its only at the very end that detectives, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), realise that they have been pawns in a bigger game.

The cast, which also includes Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Paltrow are very good and the script is brilliant. Take nothing for granted in this film. Believe me if you haven't it already seen the film, the ending will leave you fairly surprised (I think thats an understatement!). The director is David Fincher who also made Fight Club and Panic Room.

The film is grisly and quite repulsive in places. Although described as a mystery-thriller on the back of DVD case it has enough unpleasantness to be classed as horror-horror. So don't buy if you are easily spooked, or have a weak stomach!

100994,5,0790729989,"Se7en is a dark portrayal of a genius psychopath killer, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey. He is on camera for no more than last 30 minutes of the movie, but so dominant is his character that the entire movie seems to be cast around his uncanny-ness. The hero of the movie though is neither he nor Brad Pitt nor Morgan Freeman - the two detectives entrusted with the task of tracking him down. It is the plot and the script, extremely brilliant though very murky and enticingly morbid. You see gory murders that leave trace of heart-rending torture, but all that it makes you do is become more inquisitive about the killer. The killer is the sole obsession with the detectives too and the contrast between Brad Pitt's edginess and Morgan Freeman's poise is very well portrayed. It parallels the contrast between the killer's poise and the edginess of the action sequence.

The climax of the movie is startling, revealing and disturbing. It characterizes the essence of Se7en, a movie that stirs you and makes you sit up and take note of it. Calling Se7en a psychological thriller is understating its significance. It is a movie that goes well beyond that, making you aware of the morbid possibilities that exist in human mind.

101020,5,0790729989,"Few trends in modern film have proven more loathsome and tedious than the spate of derivative serial-killer movies inflicted upon the public over the last 15 or so years but, as is so often the case, this tiresome trend was kicked off by something good.  As you may have guess, that ""something good"", in this particular instance, is ""Seven"".  Now, ""Seven"" is hardly the first or the most important of the contemporary serial killer flicks, (the overpraised ""Silence of the Lambs"" gets that title) but it seems to me that ""Seven"" is the film that proved that the trend had legs, thus opening the flood gates and providing a sort of visual template for countless thrillers and horror films to come.  ""Seven"" also provided the major breakthrough for sophomore director David Fincher, who would prove to be one of the most exciting and distinctive directors of the last decade.  But, we're not here to talk about the legacy or influence or whatever of the film, we're here to discuss ""Seven"" itself, and it's a damn fine film, a modern classic and the best of its (all too often substandard) ilk.

I doubt  I need to go over the plot for anyone, but here's a taste:  Det. Sommerset (Morgan Freeman) is one week away from retirement when he receives a new partner, the young, haughty Mills (Brad Pitt) and a new, rather peculiar case:  An obese man is found in his rotted, infested home, dead with his face in a bowl of spaghetti, his hands bound and his stomach, well, burst open; the man was forced to eat himself to death.  Sommerset knows immediately that this is no normal case, and his suspicions are confirmed when a prominent defense attorney is found dead in his office of unwillingly self-inflicted wounds, the words ""Greed"" spelled out in blood.  Further investigation into the original crime finds that the words ""Gluttony"" was spelled out in grease behind the fat man's refrigerator.  Clearly, these crimes were committed by the same man, and he obviously has something of an agenda.

I'm not gonna tell you that ""Seven"" isn't steeped in the clichs of its genre, but I've no need to deny it cause the clichs aren't typically the real problem with any particular film.  In fact, I'll just add another clich to the pile by saying that Fincher and company build all this up into something which somehow transcends the genre, something which manages to stand at as totally distinct even after it has been imitated by countless other neo-noirs.  Imitation is easier said than done, however, and ""Seven"" particularly stands out because its bleak, grimy, industrial atmosphere hasn't been matched in the twelve years since it was released.  Furthermore, many of the knockoffs missed the point and the effectiveness of the film, failing to see how ""Seven"" is actually quite beautiful and elegant at times too, each shot deliberately composed, and its this contrast that really makes the film work.  All this combines to create an atmosphere that isn't just bleak, but also otherworldly and even ethereal.  Though there's nothing overtly supernatural in the film, it has a definite air of the unreal.  Almost everything apart from our few major protagonists remains ill-defined: the city is unnamed, forever shrouded in opaque sheets of rain and we see little of the oft-faceless inhabitants; the killer, John Doe, is even more mysterious, a mad, avenging angel with no history and no explanation for how he became as he is.  He doesn't even have fingerprints.  He just is, just the embodiment of the ideas he embraces.

Though the film is mostly slow-moving, the few more action/tension oriented scenes are executed with effectiveness equal to the rest of the film.  A SWAT team assault is tense and energetic, but an extended chase involving Mills and Doe is even better.  I'm usually not particularly impressed by this kinda foot-chase, but this one is just stunning, and easily the most hyper-noirish scene in the very noir film.  The climax is also well-done, sucking every drop of tension out of the scenario that is to be had.

Though Fincher's visual and atmospheric brilliance would be sufficient to carry a film that was merely passable in most other regards, the story and acting in ""Seven"" prove exceptional as well.  Truth be told, Walker's script is, in a lot of ways, fairly pedestrian, but he comes up with enough effective moments and ideas to lift it above the pack, and the very well conceived ending makes it all come together as more than a sum of its parts. Many people will no doubt tell you that the ending is predictable, but I don't think it's supposed to come as some grand surprise.  The conclusion isn't predictable:,it's inevitable.  As a whole ""Seven"" is just a smartly constructed film, one which maintains interest continuously even when not a whole lot is happening much of the time.

Though Pitt does a good job as Mills, and Paltrow (whom I don't usually much care for) is perfectly cast as his meek, strangely innocent wife, Morgan Freeman is the heart of the film.  His character is, again, a clich:  the burnt-out cop who's just waiting too retire, and who is reacts to the parade of horrors he's seen over the years by cultivating apathy, and who is irritated by his young, more idealistic partner.  I'm not sure if anyone else in the world could've pulled this role off, cause Sommerset is such a dark and almost bitter character that he could be tough to feel for, but Freeman is such an inherently likable actor that you can't help but like him.  John Doe, brilliantly played by the always great Kevin Spacey, is far more interesting than your average lecturing psychopath.  His long speeches at the conclusion of the film are also surprisingly believable, coming more as the passionate rants of someone who has thought about these issues long and hard, rather than just a rehearsed lecture.

Needless to say, ""Seven"" isn't for all tastes.  It's not as gory as it's been made out to be by some, but it's unrelentingly grim and disturbing.  (Though it does have a few touches of black-humor which work quite well.)  Still, if you like this kinda thing you'd be hard pressed to find a better film of this sort.

Morgan Freeman is a soon to retire police investigator, who gets paired with a nearly-rookie, Brad Pitt. Our young hero is married to Gwyneth Paltrow. The idea is vaguely reminiscent of the Lethal Weapon duo but it's not a laughing matter. The crimes they are investigating are heinous, and point to a diabolical serial killer who has a penchant for rendering justice upon those who have committed the ""seven deadly sins."" Kevin Spacey is particularly brilliant in his performance as the mad man, but all actors shine in this one creating a stark contrast with the gruesomeness.

101051,5,0790729989,"I rate this movie 5 stars, or 9,5/10. The movie is included among the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers. This New Line Platinum Series edition is really beautiful, with a DVD case simulating the notebook that John Doe uses in the movie, and with a second disc full of supplemental material. I miss the typical but in my opinion mandatory ""How it was made"" or ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary. You see deleted scenes and extended takes, alternate endings with awesome animated storyboards, etc. The movie in Disc One comes with an audio track specially recorded for the DVD edition, and in my Home Theatre sounds terrific. Also we have 4 different audio commentaries, by director Fincher, Freeman, Pitt and other collaborators on the film.

This is a terrific thriller focused on two detectives (one new -Pitt- another about to retire -Freeman-) after a serial killer (always brilliant Spacey) who is obsessed with books about the seven capital sins, and kills people who represents them. After the 5th murder, he turns himself in and the last two (Envy and Wrath) are just a masterpiece of an invention. I've probably seen this movie just 3 or 4 times, but I can't help to be absolutely mesmerized and surprised by the genious of the story.

This is a masterpiece of a movie. I rarely give 10/10 points to movies, so I gave this 9.5/10. To be picky, I'd like a ""Hit"" song with the closing credits. But that is just me being picky. The music by Howard Shore is good. The photography is excellent, the script is in my opinion the very best, and Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are fabulous. The movie was nominated for Best Film Editing for the Academy Awards but won nothing.

A must for any thriller fan and highly recommended to any movie fan. Your collection is not complete without this one. And for the price ($13.99 while I am writing this) you can't get any wrong.",1151107200,3,1873,4.635542168674699
101052,5,0790729989,"This chilling bit of film noir features almost unimaginable cruelty, graphically expressed.  What separates it from movies where blood flows like beer at a frat party is that the violence is never gratuitous, it is at the very center of the story, informing both character and plot.  Se7en is defined by superb art direction and an extremely intelligent script.  The overwhelming sense of dread and impending doom are reinforced with every carefully managed detail - the murder scenes in particular are so meticulously realized they resemble paintings.  The script sends characters, and viewers, scampering to the library in an attempt to understand the murderer's mind.  The bible, Milton, Chaucer, and Dante all contribute significant plot points - this is a film that talks up to its audience.

The full weight of this fleur du mal rests on the capable shoulders of Morgan Freeman, one of America's greatest actors.  His wise, world weary, and patient performance fully embodies the sense of hopelessness experienced by those who understand evil and cannot defeat it; brilliant.  Gwyneth Paltrow is deceptively effective, her fragile beauty and innocence are there to remind us that, unlike the early victims who courted their fates by wallowing in sin, true evil inevitably destroys the guiltless as well.  R. Lee Ermey, the Police Captain, unforgettable as the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, is visibly playing the role rather than being the character - he is ham-fisted at best.

But the real tragedy here, deadly sin number eight, is Brad Pitt.  One cannot excuse his wretched performance by saying that he is playing an idiot.  It might be more accurate to say that he lacks the technique and talent to act the part of an idiot - and simply being one is not the same thing.  Watch him again and notice his tendency to throw his hands purposelessly, as though he is trying to detach them from his arms.  (This ludicrous bit of physicality was carried to an absurd extreme in 12 Monkeys, the Terry Gilliam masterpiece.)

Kevin Spacey, who only appears in the third act, is nothing short of stunning.  He manages the impossible challenge of making this larger than life monster real with an ease that seems effortless, an amazing achievement.  For those of you who saw the end coming, well, there's always Barton Fink.  Se7en is a brilliant descent into the dark places of the human soul - certainly worth owning.",1148083200,3,2424,4.957920792079208

101075,5,0790729989,"""Seven"" is one of those movies I enjoyed thoroughly from start to finish. And yet I wandered around in gloom the rest of the day.

This is a movie filled with vivid death and mounting mystery. The premise is brilliant and the acting superb. A twisted killer is afoot and he is slicing, dicing, overfeeding, and generally having a great old time offing people in accordance with the seven deadly sins. The victims become stark symbols of man's greed, lust, envy, gluttony and so on. It's a brilliant mind that conceives of such a blueprint of death, and it's that brilliant mind that makes him so difficult to catch. Unless, of course, he wants to be caught.

The movie is gory and violent and those things are wonderful for your film going experience. What gets you is the low lighing, the constant rain, the dolorous music. David Fincher wants you to feel gloomy and he achieves this. Throw in a nasty, jarring ending and you'll wander away from this movie feeling like somebody tortured and killed your dog.

Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, and R. Lee Ermy all do a phenomenal job. This is one of the cleverest, most intriguing films I have ever seen. Seven is about a serial killer who murders six people, each in a way that acts out one of the seven deadly sins. The killer also considers himself associated with one of the sins, making for a surprise at the end. With the chilling ending and suspense throughout the entire film, this is easily my favorite crime movie.

101080,5,0790729989,"This is one of the most disturbing, bleakest films ever made.  It is a masterpiece of writing, cinematography, directing, and acting.  One wonders how a film as creepy and disturbing got not only green lighted, but that they left the dark, horrifying ending on it (especially during the 1990's, when creative filmmaking was at its nadir).  Usually a film like this would have been audience tested to death, and L.A. audiences always want their films to be sunny and happy (I read a story that someone in a test audience for the Joan of Arc film The Messenger didn't like the ending and asked if Joan had to die at the end), and the ending would have been changed.  But lo and behold, this brilliant piece of cinema from David Fincher (only his 2nd film and still his best) came out of the decade of the dumbed down Farrelly Brothers type movies, overrated cute, indie movies, and crappy romantic comedies.  Perhaps they pitched the story as ""a cross between Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs"", which in some ways it resembles the latter.  The film isn't perfect (there's some mundane dialogue, a few convienences in the plot), but overall the atmosphere of the film and the incredible tension make up for it.  The plot has been summarized by other reviewers here, so I won't do that, other than recommended a surprisingly thought provoking, gruesome, but never explotative film that Hollywood should make more of....",1141948800,2,1420,4.771428571428571

101104,4,0790729989,"This is not for the faint of heart.

David Fincher's dark style really shines in this film.  The characters are excellently developed, and one really does care about what happens to them.  The story is sort of odd for a detective movie, leaning a little on a Christian undertone, but it's never really played up too much, which is good in my opinion, because those types of things can detract from movies (End of Days).  This is probably one of Kevin Spacey's best roles, as the serial killer, John Doe.  Morgan Freeman does an excellent job as Somerset.  Brad Pitt really shines because he plays a sort of average detective and not some wierdo or ""seductive"" guy.  Gweneth Paltrow's part is small, but in the scenes that she's in we get to know her character well.  The mood of the movie is really dark, and it's really apparent at the ending, which is one of the most brutally intense that there is.  Don't expect to walk away from this movie feeling cheery, but expect to walk away liking it.  The DVD features on Disc 2 (4 commentaries on Disc 1) are really worthwhile, with deleted scenes that look to be remastered, explorations of title concepts, an original opening and ending, and also some segments about the remastering for DVD.  This movie is worth it for fans of crime/thriller/horror movies, even though it's not really a horror movie, but it exibits some traits.",1135555200,,1377,4.648760330578512

If you don't mind stepping over to the dark side (and I mean REALLY dark) you will enjoy following John Doe's bread crumb trail along with detectives Mills (Brad Pitt) and Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who are led from one grisly murder scene to the next over a period of a week.

The contrasting styles and philosophies of the two detectives make for great tension and polarity, but you will not find one single light or happy moment in this film.

The deaths were brutal but highly symbolic, and not simply distgusting and horrible atrocites. Of course, they were distgusting and wholly unjustified, but still quite meaningful and interesting. I particularly liked the murder for Pride. A beautiful model was hideously disfigured, then offered a call for help, with the knowledge that she would have to live the rest of her life ugly, or pills with which to kill herself and end her misery. Proving the killer's point, the woman chose death rather than ugliness.
Most of the murders are similarly complicated such as the murder for Avarice (greed). Though this movie moves a little slowly, it keeps the viewer's attention from the creepy and obsessively fanatic opening, to the thrilling and astonishing close.

101110,5,0790729989,"Se7en is a taunt and relentlessly intense thriller that will have you talking about it for days.

It tells the story of two inner-city police officers, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) and Detective Sommerset (Morgan Freeman). Mills in a young, inexperienced detective who is starving for come real action.  Detective Sommerset is ready to retire, until a case comes along that changes his plans.  Soon, both are working together to find a killer who kills his victims according to the seven deadly skills (gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, wrath).  Each crime scene gets more grousome, and each time they come closer to catching the real killer.  I would of course never reveal the ending, but let me just say that it will shock and impress you with its intelligence.

It is the second film under the direction of David Fincher, but his first was Aliens 3, so I prefer to consider it his first.  And what a debut.  The whole film seems to have a sinister atmosphere, and one that leaves a foul taste in your mouth (it's a good thing, believe me).  Each scene is well angeled.  Despite how gory the deaths are, most of the blood and bodies are kept off screen, which shows maturity on Fincher's part (sloth is pretty hard to watch, though).  Unfortunately, one thing that brings the film down is that it has a few scenes that seem to linger and have little to do with the main part, and that might take an anxious filmgoer out of the movie.  But remember to be patient, because it will all be worth it.

The acting is very memorable, especially on the villian's part ( I won't reveal the actor).  Freeman and Pitt also do great jobs, and demonstrate why they are where they are.  Gwyneth Paltrow also has a small role in the film, and she does a decend job, but is mostly on auto-drive.

Overall, Se7en is one of the most memorable thrillers for its intensity, acting, and of course, the ending.  A must-see for anyone interested in seeing how to make a sophisticated thriller.",1131062400,2,1981,4.598290598290598

101124,5,0790729989,"Please stop calling it a thriller! Sure it has some of thriller's elements but it's a straightforward drama. If you read Dostoyevsky you'd notice that ""Se7en"" is very much alike his works. 'Cos it's about good and evil and how fighting evil sometimes can turn you into evil yourself. It's a message about violence which can't be stopped with another violence. When violence is directed against violence it ends up with... right, violence again. Vicious circle. And someone has to stop it. Detective Mills couldn't and that's why we feel so sombre after the end. Not because of Gwyneth Paltrow (you know what I mean).

One more time we received an evidence that our world is chaotic, that it's not going to be a nice place, that it's violent and that even good intentions won't make it a better place. Forgive me my English but I assume they say: ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"".

""Se7en"" is one of the most realistic and therefore depressive films of all time, it's a serious piece of art and by calling it a ""thriller"" people steel much of its value. And if you always considered it just a thriller watch it one more time, try to see what's inside and you'll be amazed at what you find.

By the way this two-disc edition is one of the best DVD-editions ever.

101125,5,0790729989,"Boy, what can I say about this film that hasn't been said yet? In my eyes, it is easily the best psychopath movie I've ever seen. But that alone seems a little gratuitious, doesn't it? So let's be a little more specific.

The tone of the film is perfect all the way through. Shot in a noir style, David Fincher (""The Game"", ""Fight Club"") managed to get the mood just right: bleak, tragic, dark, wet and crazy. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are two detectives hot on the trail of a crazed psychopath (or so they think) who happens to get off by making ordinary people an example of each of the seven deadly sins.

What starts to be a regular psycho film, becomes totally out of the ordinary halfway through when the detectives become aware that it is not your average-run-of-the-mill psychopath they are dealing with. Just when they think they are about to screw him, it's him who's screwing them. And that's one of the remarkable beauties of this film which makes it quite unique in its genre.

Kevin Spacey is one of those actors whose screen presence emanates such class that he can aswell just sit around looking pretty. In ""Se7en"", there's a scene where Spacey engages in a supreme dialogue with Pitt and Freeman through the security division of a police car on the way to a particularly important location. This scene is for many reasons the centerpoint of the movie and Spacey's performance is so convincing that at some point you begin to question the atrocity of his previous deeds and whether there's actually some truth in his arguments. Few actors could play this as well as Spacey but he totally nails it.

Take a brilliant director and three superb actors, all of whom can't put out a bad performance for the life of them. Add amazing cinematography and a top-notch, virtually flawless thriller script. What you get is one of the best films of the decade and a landmark in the career of everyone involved.",1128729600,,1917,4.612903225806452

The characters and plot all begin as if this is a run-of-the mill cliched cop-movie but the film soon evolves into something quite different. Sinister and unexpected this movie had me hooked as the two cops investigate a string of brutal murders.

I found the film enjoyable but not light-hearted. For fans of these types of movies this is easily one of the best. I would not recommend this to people who don't like profanity or violence. Even though most of the violence in this movie is implied rather than explicit it can still be hard to stomach for some viewers.

It begins with the death of a fat man who has ingested so much spaghetti that his killer hasn't necessarily done the deed, but has helped to create a morbid masterpiece of death that even boggles detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt). The two seem to form a mutual respect and a unique bond as a result of eventually working on the cast together, and as the murders pile up, so does the suspense and the chills. The scariest moment of the film involves the discovery of a body in an apartment complex that looks like a corpse that, according to the evidence they find, has been there for over a year. When the body moves and wriggles around, you'll jump five feet out of your seat. They chase the killer down alleyways, cutting corners and getting hurt in the process. Again, the setting is incredibly strong, adding to the air of suspense present throughout the feature. As Somerset and Mills continue to compile evidence and theories to solve the mystery of the killer's ""seven deadly sins"" motive, he unwittingly shows up at the precinct and gives himself up...ah, but he's got a motive.

While on the car ride out to the open to find the last of the killer's victims, they unwittingly end up in a game that leads one of them to a fatal flaw: the last two deadly sins. Mills doesn't realize that his wife was murdered by the killer, and he decided to take a prize with him: her head. The tension and suspense builds to such tight levels at this point near the close of the film, you'll be biting your nails and waiting for the rope to snap. Indeed, the ending proves to be quite powerful, and after the credits are rolling, you'll be asking yourself many questions and be praising the movie's tight weave of suspense and dark comedy.

Gwenyth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, and Leland Orser all make good impressions in this film, but without a doubt, Kevin Spacey nearly steals the show as the infamous killer who takes his work seriously and is so subdued and calm about his demeanor, you'll start to wonder whether the people you're around in your real life could be like him. Freeman and Pitt, again, are stellar in the lead roles, making you feel every bit of anguish, every laugh, every tear, every scare, every breath. You even start to feel the sweat and  the wounds like you've inherited them. The movie's cinematography is excellent, and the photography elements are perfectly set. No doubt this was Fincher's little masterpiece, and following it up with THE GAME only proved his importance in this genre.

So while their are some genuine chills to be had, the atmosphere and smart script keep you on your toes. Working from a premise of such style and uniqueness, SEVEN is one of the best thrillers committed to film and should be viewed at least once in your lifetime. Don't let this pass you up...it could be your one and only sin.",1126742400,,3469,4.597738287560581
101129,5,0790729989,"Wow. That's how I have to start off this review of ""Seven"". This is absolutely one of the most disturbing, chilling and intelligent suspense thrillers I have ever seen. A killer uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his inspiration for murder, and Brad Pitt (as the newly assigned and eager David Mills) and Morgan Freeman (the cynical veteran inner-city cop William Somerset), are the two detectives assigned to the case.

Morgan, as always, is amazing in his role, one that is right up there with his performances in ""Glory"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"". There is only one scene in which he actually smiles and laughs, but that's about it. He engrosses himself in this role and plays it with deadpan seriousness. He also muses about how society is changing and not for the better, and this is a major influence for his decision to retire from the force. Brad Pitt, who is equally as good, provides some comic relief, spouting some of the funniest quips in the movie. But you never lose sight of the fact that this is a dark, hard-edged drama with horrible things happening to the victims of ""John Doe"" (Kevin Spacey), the brilliantly calculating but equally insane, creepy murderer who never leaves a fingerprint behind at a crime scene (and you will go ""ugh"" when you find out just why that is so). He, however, always leaves a small clue at each gruesome crime scene for Somerset and Mills to find to link one victim to the next. Doe feels it's his duty to ""turn the sin against the sinner"". There is a method to his madness, though: He chose his victims carefully, according to the way they lived their lives. He doesn't feel that they are ""victims"" but people who all deserved to die, and he believes that he was the one who was ""chosen"" to eliminate them.

""Seven"" is symbolic of several things in this film: Of course, as I mentioned earlier, the Seven Deadly Sins (Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, Wrath) are the killer's inspiration; Somerset has only seven days to retirement and he was given this assignment as his final investigation; seven is the also the amount of days that transpire between the beginning and the ending of this case; and seven are the amount of victims that are at John Doe's mercy in that time span.

Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Mills' wife Tracey, and there is a certain sadness to her character, something she reveals to Somerset one day while they are having breakfast in a diner. Even though her role is not one that is major throughout this movie, she is a crucial element that plays itself out in the climax of the film.

One thing I've noticed that adds to the somberness of this film is that in every scene, practically every day, it is dark, dreary and raining. The last day, as a change of pace, the rain has stopped and the sun comes out. The movie's climax takes place in the desert, and what transpires between Somerset, Mills and John Doe will totally knock you out. I remember not being able to breathe during the last few minutes of ""Seven"" because I was literally on the edge of my seat. With great performances, a stellar script and exceptional direction, ""Seven"" is an excellent film that you will never forget.",1126396800,22,3166,4.628113879003559

I am barely starting to get into detective films as well as Mobster/Gangster films although this does not fall into those two categories. Seven is has a great cast, even though Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey have only a limited amount of screen time, their performences are still effective, especially Kevin Spacey's. Morgan Freeman did a wonderful job in this film as a the cool headed detective who is a true intellectual in this film, contrary to the hot headed Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt played his part well, in perfect contrast to his partner, of course this scenario has been seen before but that doesn't matter because Brad does true justice to his part of this duo. The ending was unexpected and suited Brad's character well, although I figured out from the begining that he was going to commit one of the seven ""deadly"" sins. The only problem I had, was that this DVD did not come with any extra features, especially commentaries which I would have liked. Great film.",1125878400,,1080,4.75

101133,5,0790729989,"And I say the best because this movie is so much more than just your typical horror film.  This film has a bite that most don't, it has a sense of reality, a gritty sense of human emotion that gets left out of most horror films.  This movie takes the time to explain it's charactors, everyone from Somerset (Freeman) to Mills (Brad Pitt in his BEST role ever) and even your killer John Doe (Kevin Spacey, Brilliant as he always is).  I thought that was the best part of this movie, that it took the time to explain your killer, took the time to get you inside his head and see why he was the way that he was and to see the reactions that he had to others and the reactions that they had to him (especially Pitt...the scene of dialog alone between Pitt and Spacey in the police car towards the end is the best scene in the film)...So our story revolves around a group of murders in NYC all based on various 'deadly-sins'...opening scene is an obese man who was forced to eat until his stomach burst.  So you see that our killer forces his victims to kill themselves via their sin.  (The most disturbing is lust, believe me!)  So even though the film never shows a murder take place you see the aftermath of each and each one in particular is disturbing in itself.  The while air to this film is creepy, eeire and puts you in a mood before the suspence starts.  You must know that this is not the 'jump out of your seat and pee your pants' type of film, its more like the type you think about later with the lights on and your covers pulled up to your head.  It's a pschological thriller that messes with your head, makes you think about why this man did what he did and may even make you wonder if he had a point.  There is a strong moral backdrop to this movie, which is also something that is lacking in almost every other horror film.  The killer had a reason, maybe not an excuse buthe had a reason that he was able to justify in his mind for doing what he did...a reason that he calculated out, that he meditated on and most importantly, it was a reason he BELIEVED in...it was a code that he lived by and he was convinced was right even though he knew it was wrong.  Kevin Spacey is so convincing in his portrayal of a disturbed man, a man plauged by a hightened sense of morality that forced him to be morally coruptable.  This is a movie I think everyone should see, if not for sheer entertainment, see it for the message it conveys, a message that can be contorted and twisted to fit anyones interpretation, I guess the only way to really appreciate this film is to watch it and interprete it for yourself.",1124755200,,2614,4.2354124748490944
101164,5,0790729989,"Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, Lust, Envy, Pride, and Wrath. The topic of the Seven Deadly sins has been around for centuries, but with David Fincher's 1995 thriller, it is made into a topic that stays branded in the human mind even after the credits roll.

This psychological thriller is about a detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and his newly acquired partner Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), who have to hunt down a serial killer who is killing people according to the seven deadly sins. At first, the killer, nicknamed John Doe, seems to be just a madman, but as the killings start to become more and more violent, the detectives and the viewers discover that this killer is smart, clever, sinister, and patient. John Doe has marked his reputation as one of the most evil villans in cinematic history. From the movie's beginning, to its shocking twisted ending, David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker(writing credits) make a fantastic pair in exposing the world to the imperfection of human emotion and psyche. 5 stars.",1124409600,,1013,4.958823529411765

101166,5,0790729989,"There are just too many things needed to be said about Se7en.  It's one of my favorite movies of all time and will most likely remain there for a long, long time.  All the actors do marvelous jobs.  All the camera angles and lighting are fantastic, and bring an element of Film Noir (if you don't know what that film term is, then I suggest you look it up) to a film from 1995.  The originality and creativity displayed here is really what takes a hold of me personally.  For those who do not know what this movie is about I will sum it up with this: Se7en is about two Police Officers (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) who probe the murders of a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins.  There isn't a single flaw in this movie that I have noticed and believe me; I've watched this plenty of times.  There are no plot holes, no annoying things, no bad acting, and no rip-offs, nothing that brings this movie down.

People complain about the ending in that it is a bit of a downer.  I thought that too the first time I watched it, but afterwards I found myself drawn to the play button on my remote again and again.  Several people complain that this movie is too gruesome or of bad taste.  These people are ignorant and are clearly in denial of the darks spots of society that exist every day.  When you see this movie you realize that things like this happen, maybe not as intense as this, but they happen.  Bad things happen to good people.  We have Richard ""The Night Stalker"" Ramirez, Rape, Aids, Arson, Police Brutality, Cults, the Jonestown Massacre, etc. Listen, if you thought that this movie was too gory, then you seriously need to toughen up your stomach and sense of reality.  If anything this movie is not gory enough (it leaves a lot of it to your imagination, and you never actually see anybody killed).

There are gorehounds who complain that this movie wasn't gory enough.  If you want to complain about ""sick people"" then why don't you go and attack the film makers that bring us the great horror classics like ""the Evil Dead"" or ""the Halloween movies or why not go so far as to attack ""Dead Alive"" (The Goriest Movie ever made, oddley enough it's a dark comedy directed by Peter Jackson).  Labeling Se7en as a sick movie only supports the idea that it is sick because you don't like it and choose to look away.  It is that very idea that the killer John Doe tried to point out that ""we see a deadly sin on every street corner and we tolerate it, because it is common.""  I'm not sure if I have that quote exactly but it's the same overall message.  I could go further but I feel I have made my point.

This movie is disgustingly beautiful.  It's crude, but effective and there are just so many things about it that scream perfection.  Everything including the incredible opening credits scene with the disturbing Nine Inch Nails music (the song is called Closer (Precursor Remix)) is done to such a degree of perfection, that it is impossible to ignore.  The DVD box artwork is really cool to look at and on the second disc with the bonus features, we are shown that this one guy actually wrote out every single one of John Doe's journals and handmade it himself.  That is something you will not find happening behind the sets of most movies, rarely is that mush effort put into one.  And of course let's not forget the acting.  It's fabulous; Morgan Freeman only enforces his brilliance and his title as my favorite actor.  A movie like this only comes along once in a while, so therefore you must see this movie and if you like it, then go ahead and buy it.  It's understandable that this film is not for everyone, but hopefully it will open your eyes or pry them open.  Open way or another it may change you in some way, even if it's the smallest degree.  Well, hoped you found this review helpful and that you will enjoy this movie if you haven't already.",1123372800,,3919,4.4
101167,5,0790729989,"This movie is not for everyone. But for those willing to take the leap, it affects you in ways you cannot imagine. The portrayal of characters in this movie, and the events that occur are so real that it's scary. Right from the opening credits, you know there's something special about this movie. First, I'll give a short description of the amazing storyline that is Se7en.

The movie is set in New York City. Detective Somerset, a man who has been in service for a long time, feels that he has seen too much violence and hatred in the world. He is about to retire. His last case however, intrigues him. He believes that it is a start of a serial murder. Detective Mills, who was just assigned to the department, is a young and eager detective. He helps Somerset with the investigation. The first murder was in fact, the start of a serial murder. The murderer is committing the murders based on the 7 deadly sins; namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride and lust. It is then a cat and mouse game between the detectives and the murderer, known simply as John Doe. The movie spirals to dizzying heights and ends with a stunning albeit demented plot twist.

This movie is special in so many ways, its context transcends time. It actually speaks to you. The difference between the 2 detectives alone, speak volumes. It's not just a pairing of young and old, white and black. They are very different men, having experienced different things in life. One is an optimist, and the other a pessimist. The interesting thing that separates them is their opinions and views on life, and on everyday crimes. The place, New York City is shown as a dark and decaying city. It rains everyday, the future seems bleak. And the act of murders is supposedly sermons from the man behind it. It is not random, it is planned. He wants it to be studied and analyzed, for the meaning of his act to reach people. Many things said in this movie really made me think. I found the dialogue between characters fascinating and creepy at the same time. At one point, the murderer says ""We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore."" In some aspects, he was right. We read the newspapers everyday. Reports of murder, robbery and abuse. Crimes that are committed by men, people die everyday not of natural causes but by us. Do we even think twice about it? We just move on to the next story. It is sad that humanity has come to this. And that is what I mean, the movie touches your soul, questions the harsh reality of life. You realize the world is not as wonderful as you've imagined.

Rarely does a movie like this come to be made without a group of talented people behind it, and watching the movie, every one of them should be complimented. It takes guts to make a movie like this, it is definitely not mainstream, nor will it make anyone leaving the theater feeling good about themselves. But we need this kind of movies once a while to remind us, that movies can be great, it can affect people and make a difference rather than just entertain us. The writer does a tremendous job with the script. It is so profound and disturbingly real. Directing from David Fincher, a man I have huge respect for, is also flawless. And the acting from every one of the characters couldn't be better. Morgan Freeman is dead-on as Detective Somerset, as is Brad Pitt as Detective Mills. They both deliver what I believe the best performances of their career. And the murderer...aahh, the murderer who is left uncredited practically adds the finishing touch to an already great movie. He is so convincing, every word he mutters sends a chill down your spine. And the scary thing is, I was actually nodding to certain things he was saying. ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you'll notice you've got their strict attention."" To me, everything in this movie came together so well, it is so much more than ""just a thriller"", and the 5-star rating I give it is definitely justified.

So, if you want to be surprised, if you want to break out from the usual trash Hollywood dumps on us, if you're willing to take a risk...watch this movie. Yes, it is surreal and it does contain graphic images. But my goodness, this movie is so much more; it reflects our life and questions your conscience. One of my all-time favorites. Highly recommended!",1121644800,2,4537,4.56319018404908
101168,5,0790729989,Seven is in the top 5 of my favorite movies of all time.  It started a movement in film that has spawned many other great movies and unfortunately a lot of rip offs.  This is the original horror/thriller movie.  The roles are so well casted that you don't see Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman but rather Dectives Somerset and Mills.  The detailed plot with no holes is such a breath of fresh air.  The mystery and complexity of this movie is almost indescribable.  I can not say enough good things about this movie.,1121212800,,511,4.440860215053763
101169,5,0790729989,"If you ask ten movie fans what their favorite David Fincer movie is, eight are probably going to say 'Fight Club.'  I am one of the minority.  Seven is not only my favorite Fincher movie, but it is one of my favorite movies ever.  It is so much more than a crime drama.  It is nothing short of a masterpiece.

Seven follows two detectives, the calm, wise, and soon to retire Somerset (Freeman) and the young, gifted hotshot Mills (Pitt).  These two, opposite personalities arrive at the scene of a particularly grisly murder of a morbidly obese man.  I will not disclose details, but the killings are reminiscent of the style shown in ""Silence of the Lambs"" and years later, ""Saw"".  During a second inspection of the crime scene, prompted by plastic shavings found in the stomach of the dead man, ""gluttony"" is found carved into the wall behind the refrigerator.  Soon after, a lawyer turns up dead in another bizzare murder, and ""greed"" is spelled out in his own blood on the carpet.  The killer chooses victims who embody the Seven Deadly Sins.  Somerset and Mills take the case.  They pick up on the pattern and know that the killer will strike agian and follow his trail.  It becomes evident early on that this is no ordinary killer, though.  He has every move plotted well in advance, and his killings make a stark commentary on the flaws of society today.  He uses each victim's sin as the central instrument in his elaborate, almost artistic executions.  He offers an alternate and thought provoking viewpoint on justice.  It makes the viewer think more than any standard fare thriller ever would.  The ending is superb as well.  Don't listen to any of the other reviews, it comes as a complete shock.  I really want to go more in depth on the plot, but it would be doing this movie an injustice to give away too much.  Just know that different than the rest of the crime movies you have ever seen, and so chilling and thought provoking.  It is scary not because it is overly gory, nor is it scary due to cheesy special effects.  Seven is frightening because the events in the world represented in the film could all too easily be real, and that is an entirely different type of fear.

The Final Word - An absolutely amazing movie that will floor you with it's originality and intelligence.  Nihlistic and frightening, it is mainstream cinema at its absolute best.  It suceeds in every way imaginable.  A must have for any true movie fan.",1120089600,,2445,4.586605080831409

101171,5,0790729989,"This movie is absolutely riveting and thrilling. It is sad, as well as freaky at times and is almost as good as the Silence of the Lambs. It isn't a shoot em up thriller as it develops slowly with detectives Sommerset and Mills, played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt who inspect murders, all realting to the seven deadly sins. The movie is very original and has a great performance by Kevin Spacey as the killer, John Doe.

It does have lots of disturbing images as well as a pretty freaky plot but is reccomended for anyone who likes good thrillers. This is a scary movie because it could be real, while all of the movies in the horror section like Freddy or Jason are just stupid because it isn't realistic and the killers are invincible. I hope everyone realizes this and doesn't go to see the millions of even worse sequels.

On the other hand, Seven is scary and is a masterpiece. This movie has all of the pieces it needs to succeed, from a good cast, to a good plot, to a well executed film, it succeeds in every possible domain. Reccomended to everyone who isn't faint of heart.",1119225600,,1087,4.402985074626866
101172,5,0790729989,"When the sins are committed from two in two you have to pay them from one in one; Rudyard Kipling was the author of this singular statement. This film became the great leap of David Fincher to the big screen. Original script that deals with a serious damaged mental  man, who bets to be God and choosing every victim according every one of those kidnapped codes. But beware the religious fanatic  can become heretics due precisely, to his own fanaticism.

Seven capital sins: seven crimes that must be done to clean the world from the stinkers and vicious human beings. In this chrysalis and under those extreme prejudices you can not expect too much sense of the reality. And Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt will be the investigators who will be assigned to chase this lunatic and out of his mind man. Excellent shots, brutal and extremely graphic violence, but superbly fascinating.

101184,5,0790729989,"What i like about seven is the atmosphere. Everything in the film seems to sag under an invisible blanket of misery and grime which projects an imagery that is quintessentially urbane. The two main actors give splendid performances as the hard minded detectives. Pitt is in moody form as the angry young detective, struggling to find some goodness in his life through his devotion to his pregnant wife, Freeman's character has long since given up on the light, he is weighed down by the horrors his job has exposed him to. Either of the two detectives could testify as a truthful guide to the miserable and cruel world they occupy. Spacey in this movie is spaced out, so completely does he dissolve into the shell of the deranged self-guided prophet cum serial killer.

The plot of Seven is really quite simple, so simple that between the pregnant beginning (pun intended) and the stunning perfect twist at the end the director finds himself with a lot of space to fill, so this is filled up with the hunt for the killer and the detectives travel on a gruesome trip through varying interesting forms of sadism, savagery and sheer horror as they follow the killer through his victims - all seemingly normal people who's transgression of one of the seven deadly sins is the  killers professed motive for killing them. The sheer shock value of the murders themselves easily differentiates this film from others of it's genre, the director truly was pushing the envelope in terms of horror. The ending of this film...is legend, simply put it is probably the finest neatest ending i have ever seen, because of it's power to haunt and seize the imagination of the viewer, it guarantees that once seen the film will not be forgotten.

Seven could serve as a prophecy of things to come, today religious nuttiness is making a comeback, and everyone seems to be generally more desensitised to suffering and cruelty compared to say - forty years ago.

I actually give this film 4.5 out of 5 (because the motive for the murders stretched the bounds of credibility a bit and the films constant hammering of it's negative message is ultimately a little oppressive,and character development could have gone further - these are interesting characters!). One of the best thrillers of the last 15 years, no doubt.",1117497600,2,2295,4.817258883248731
101185,5,0790729989,"wow, thats really all i could say at the end of this movie. dark, grungy, twisted, creepy and all around powerful. Se7en is excellently cast, brilliantly written, and masterfully directed. Pitt and Freeman are great as the token polar opposite cops, yet take this familiar role to a new level. and Kevin Spacey, what is there to say except Fincher could not have picked a better person to fully display the power of John Doe. Spacey only shows up in the last 20 minutes, but the scenes with him are so well acted that he should have received two oscars that year (in addition to Usual Suspects). The story is incredibly well written, a killer that slays victims in the form of the the seven deadly sins. You never see the crimes, just the aftermath. Through this, Fincher makes the audience use their imagination, which almost makes it creepier. not one scene of this movie is wasted, every one puts another piece of the puzzle together. this is the one movie that gives the bad guy full control throughout the entire piece and is still a great flick. Se7en is just proof that, sometimes the good guys get the short end of the straw, no matter how sadistic that bad guy really is. Get this movie, don't rent it, don't watch it on TV, just buy it, you won't be disappointed.",1117065600,2,1273,4.515151515151516
101186,5,0790729989,"One of the most engrossing films I have ever seen. The characters and images from the film stayed with me longer than I wanted. I mean that in a good and creepy way.

I very much like the storytelling style, we get to see in different emphasis and length all the seven deadly sins performed by the serial killer as his modus operandi, Some are visually grotesque, others psychologically disturbing and others both. I was especially disturbed with the ""lust"" part, it wasn't exactly visually shown but just the way it was explained and said was just unthinkable. And of course the ending which was the culmination of the performed seven deadly sins was just unbelievably terrifying. It's creepy in the psychological and spiritual way because just when you thought it's just a run of the mill serial killer's acts, there's a disturbing rationalization for that acts. Really disturbing, I can't say that word enough

The atmosphere of the film was also a strength of the film, it has a gritty and simplistic approach to how the movie is going to look like. And the result is an elegant and un-Hollywood look for the film. The chaotic and impersonal nature of the city as a backdrop provided a strong mood for the lonely and disillusioned characters in this film. I think it was brilliantly setuped and designed.

Even though this movie is too popular to be a cult classic, but also not too popular with regard to critical acclaim and awards unlike Silence of the Lambs, that's why I personally think it's underappreciated. This movie is an intelligent and thought-provoking thriller that deserves to be regarded in the same breath as the great thrillers of all time.

101187,5,0790729989,"I think the only way a sequel to Se7en can work is if they go on the premise that John Doe had a partner. I get this from the taxicab scene in front of the police station. I mean, how could the guy call down a cab, all bloody, hop in, be carried to the police station without the taxi driver saying anything or calling the cops? You can see as John Doe gets out of the cab that he has no coat or anything to cover up the blood. He just hops out and walks on into the station. I think John Malkovich would make a great secret partner.

Also, Morgan Freeman has to come back. Freeman was in his late 50s when he made the first one. Now his heading toward 70. That's a problem too. Also David Fincher has to return also (if he returns Freeman will be back for sure). Maybe even a cameo by Brad Pitt's Det. Mill's (maybe from a mental institution or jail)? Also, they have to get Andrew Kevin Walker (came up with the first movie/screenplay) back to at least give his touch to the screenplay.

Or they could take it from what John Doe said about his ""plan"" being studied and pondered over. Some nut takes over and copycats.",1116288000,,1119,4.128440366972477
101188,5,0790729989,"This is a crime story like no other. Most of these kind of, serial killer on the loose, movies don't get into such specific detail of the crimes like in SEVEN. When I saw Seven as a kid, I thought it was disgusting, but not necessarily scary, when everyone was told it was a horror before it came to theatre's. It is a horror in a way. But a different ""kind"" of horror. I was too young to understand everything that occured throughout the film. I had to ask mom some questions but she never gave me a blunt answer. She always sugar coated everything up. Now I'm 23, and I've seen SEVEN many times. The most disturbing scene in the movie is (I'm not sure if everyone understood) but I did.. it was when detective mills and sommerset go to that bondage shop to see a photograph of an object the store-owner made for joe doe (the killer) It doesn't really let you see the photo for that long. Only a quick glance but if you have it on DVD you can pause it and get a good look at it. First, it is a ribbed knife over 8 inches long that straps around the guys waiste like a strap on adult toy, but instead it's a knife, and in the photo a real person is not wearing it, only a dummy. Then, when he goes after his next victim, the killer goes to a whore-house, and barges in on a man who paid for the hooker. He pulls out a gun, and forces the married man to put on the weapon and told him to ""F*ck her"". If you can imagine how brutal that is. It is a bit crossing the line in a very disturbing way. They show the photo again, when they are questioning the tramatized man who was forced to kill the prostitute by stabbing her reproductive organs with an 8 inch knife. Once again, that's a very graphic thing to have in a movie. And the other murders were especially haneous. Over feeding the fat man to death, cutting off the beauty queen's face, forcing atrition on the lawyer to cut his own stomach open, cutting off gweneth's head, and torturing a drug dealer for a year. It ceratinly isn't a bed time story, or for the religious fanatics.",1112572800,,2036,4.156962025316456
101189,5,0790729989,"Se7en can be legitimately labelled one of the most original classic serial killer films ever produced. It truly is a masterpiece in terms of depicting monstrous evil in the guise of religious righteousness against a backdrop of modern nihilism and human degradation.

The film focuses on the seven deadly sins created in the 13th century by Catholic theologians as a method to teach virtue and the dangers of the individual relenting to their base desires. These sins are in fact extremes of natural human desires - hunger/gluttony, laziness/sloth, self-esteem/pride, sexual appetite/lust and so on.

The film uses this notion of sin as a metaphor for modern society in general. Every scene is dark, degraded in appearance, raining - there is nothing in the story that provides the viewer with any contrast, that is hope, light or compassion. Se7en is intended to reveal the flipside to human nature in its extremes and how far we have dwindled as a civilization.

Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is at the end of a long career as a police detective. He has seen human degradation in its many forms, and is finally only seven days away from his retirement. As a character, Somerset is cynical, wise about human nature, however is still effected by man's inhumanity to man. He wants to get out. Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) is a young ambitious officer, newly transferred to the city and is anxious to make his mark. By contrast, Mills is excitable, emotional and takes the job personally. Together they find themselves in the wake of vicious and methodical murders, designed around the seven deadly sins. The killer is a man with tremendous will and patience, sometimes torturing his victims for days, and in one case, a full twelve months. These murders are exceptionally horrific because the killer wants to make a grand point, because he is preaching to the world about how far he believes we have fallen as a society, morally and ethically. In the killers mind, he believes we have dwindled so far and have become so apathetic, that we need to be literally shocked to our moral senses.

In this special edition, included are deleted scenes and extended takes with Fincher commenting in the background. One of the more interesting additions is the commentary and creation of John Doe's notebooks. They were actually handwritten and drawn with painstaking precision. These extras accurately reveal the amount of detailed work that goes into creating a film of this high standard.

Se7en is an exceptionally well-made film, and one of those pictures that can be viewed several times over the years to still find new aspects about it never seen before.",1111968000,,2655,4.9707207207207205
101190,4,0790729989,"Considering this movie was made in ten years ago, I thought the quality of film making would be a bit ordinary. In any case,thirty minutes into the film I'm left to feel like a part of the movie. Morgan Freeman is very good and fits his role. Brad Pitt on the other end with his slight humor fits his quite easily too. Now there were atleast two scenes in the film that made me jump up from my seat and scream.

What I Liked about this film is the conclusions and the mystery based atmosphere the director creates. Of Course Pitt's done better films. This has to be my favourite Morgan Freeman flick though. The movie was made further more interesting by Kevin Spacey. There's a scene with heated dialogues being extended to him by Pitt. I thought that scene towards the climax made the film very interesting indeed.

I was left a bit spellbound by the ""help me"" inscription on the wall. Gwyneth Paltrow has looked more beautiful in her other films. She doesnt have much of a role. The film also gives an insight on how detectives work. No it doesnt force it down your throat but just gives you a polite view.

Overall I would say a film worth watching every few months. Kevin Spacey added more thrill to the film. A lot of very interesting and amusing scenes make sure its nothing less than a four starrer.",1111881600,,1307,4.4149377593361

101192,5,0790729989,"It's interesting watch Seven because it's quite depressing and bleak with none of that hope at the end of the tunnel hidden away somewhere. It's gritty and realistic. David Fincher manages to make a film with those qualities but without alienating the viewer which is quite a feat. I don't know many people who would watch such a dark film without it being too much so.

Detective Somerset is literally 7 days away from retirement. He gets paired up with a new partner, Detective Mills. Their first assignment is a really fat guy who looks like he was fed to death. Somerset realizes that criminals don't take this long to do a murder, the murder has to have a meaning.

Mills finds a 2nd body: a lawyer who's had a pound of flesh cut from him. The word Greed is written on the floor. Somerset returns to the fat guy's apartment and finds the word ""Gluttony"" in grease. A-ha! The killer's using the 7 deadly sins as basis for his murders: Envy, Pride, Lusy, Wrath, Sloth, Lust and Envy. He helps Mills in following the clues so that they can hopefully stop the killer before he completes his 7.

Even on repeated viewings, the cat and mouse game they're involved with still seems interested as the killer is always one step ahead, leaving clues that tend to be a little less obvious, such as turning a painting upside down so that the detectives are clued in that there's fingerprints behind the painting.

The 2 actors provide a nice counterbalance: Pitt as Mills is brash, abrasive and likes to swear a lot. Freeman as Somerset is very calm, knowledgable and neat. In one of the earlier scenes, Mills wakes up with kind of wrinkly looking clothes and a messy apartment while Somerset has everything ironed, straightened out and everything.

As for the films near infamous ending it does come out of left field and isn't the most happiest. Which is quite nice in a film where something actually terrible happens instead of the cop who walks away with just a bullet in his leg while the rest of him emotionally and physically he's fine. The 2 main characters both walk away from this film feeling very affected by what happened.

As for parents who are concerned over kiddies watching? Definately do not let them see this. The murders; while never seeing what happened they just show the aftermath of it, are quite violent and brutal. To detail an example: one victim is raped forcibly with a strap-on only the object in the end is quite sharp and knife-like. You don't see anything, you just see a picture, which makes your mind go into overdrive about how painful it must've been, which is a nice touch by Fincher. A lot of times our mind creates the worst imaginable if we can't know what exactly it was.

It's a really great film if you're old enough. It's got action and a bit of humor and it's a film that likes to last with you whether you want it to or not.",1110585600,2,2865,4.519305019305019
101213,3,0790729989,"Imagine: there's a gun to your head. What values are expendable? How much hope and dignity would you surrender? That's the challenged posed by Director David Fincher and Screenwriter Andrew Walker's 1995 gun, called *SE7EN*.

*SE7EN* suffers enough flaws to fall short of the thematically profound film its five-star fans want it to be. Nevertheless, it's that rarest of slasher-thrillers: moody, engaging, and mainstream.

Of course it is. As director David Fincher's second theatrical outing, *SE7EN* appeals to the industrial-gothic-punk culture dominating early to mid 1990's America. There are the obvious atmospheric giveaways: like the prominence of Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, and Gravity Kills in the soundtrack; bleak and decaying set design right out of Tool, Stabbing Westward, and *The Downward Spiral*, and the incessant but fashionable harping upon the darkness of humanity. Less obvious commercial appeal includes the sheer nihilism and anarchy in the dialogue, as well as a multitude of BDSM images and themes. People ranging from H.R. Geiger to Marilyn Manson would find themselves at home in this picture.

Within this trendy (but well sculpted) atmosphere, Fincher paints a picture of religious vigilantism. To paraphrase comedian George Carlin, serial killer ""John Doe"" does not have pet peeves; he has major psychotic hatreds. The film builds around his campaign to take these hatreds out upon seven people, each of whom seems ""guilty"" of committing a deadly sin. Doe takes the deadly part a little too far, and so his punishments severely outweigh the ""crime"". And if murdering people because they're too fat or too beautiful wasn't petty enough, Doe gleefully kills them in a manner reflecting their sin, and usually slow and painful.

Unfortunately, the film itself seems to agree with Doe, and that's one of several problems preventing *SE7EN* from being anything other than a slasher film.

The filmmakers repeat one of Oliver Stone's core mistakes from *Natural Born Killers*--they fall in love with their villain. From the beginning *SE7EN* stacks the audience in John Doe's favor by making most of his victims repulsive--a fat man, a prostitute, a lawyer--playing on our own prejudices to excuse his spectacularly sadistic actions. Furthermore, the film's protagonists come across as morally and intellectually impotent in the face of John Doe; in the car scene towards the end of the film, the killer dismantles the detectives' arguments with ease, even as I sat in the theater refuting every one of his points in my head. Finally, the surprise ending leaves little doubt that, yes, John Doe is the man with the plan; rendering all other people victims.

This notion of the human flock doomed before the wolves is no slip. In another mistake repeated from Stone's *NBK*, *SE7EN* becomes the monster it portrays. It browbeats the audience with nihilism, harping incessantly on the futility of preventing evil. In fact, *SE7EN* goes so far as to portray heroic and idealistic protagonists who are destroyed by the villain; only the apathetic survive. It revels in clever and stylish crime scenes, enjoying the carnage as much as John Doe. And with the type of victims portrayed, the audience can enjoy it too. By the end, with our heroes defeated and the audience staring into the symbolic setting sun of death, I was stunned. Not by any profound revelation about humanity, but by the story's blinkered pessimism.

Look, I like dark art such as *The Downward Spiral* and the *The Wall* as much as the next guy. Partly because those albums had complex hearts or themes. That's *SE7EN's* final and most fatal obstacle to being profound: there's no developed message or truth here. The religious and literary themes dress up the plot and characters, but convey only the most trivial and disagreeable message that people should be damned for being themselves. There is nothing profound about killing people for being people.

Of course, none of this should come as a surprise from a director who allegedly wanted to make *Alien 3* look like a snuff film in space. But damn if David Fincher can't make a slasher film look good. Fincher has an unparalleled grasp on camera angles, lighting, and set design. The foot chase between Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey actually excited me, and was one of the more intense action scenes I've seen on film. Fincher achieved an atmospheric soundtrack as well, and Howard Shore's score works well with the dripping, peeling sets and the techno-industrial tunes. Despite the film's overall inhumanity, every scene bristles with little human touches, from sleeping on couches to preparing for work to getting stuck with an apartment too close to an elevated train. Altogether, *SE7EN* shows off the lessons Fincher learned from *Alien 3* and applied to later films.

And while I'm at it, I gotta give props to the screenwriter. I sure didn't think of this story idea. The whole deadly sin motif and their murderous mirrors gave this thriller a spark of originality if nothing else. The story also suspends belief well with the details of police work and characters. The exchanges between newcomer Detective Mills and members of his Hell's Kitchen precinct provides plenty of darkly amusing personality sparring.

The actors certainly helped this along. I believe Brad Pitt was an energetic cop with a chip on his shoulder. And Morgan Freeman was Detective Somerset in all his methodical glory. Even bit characters liven up the scenes and compare or contrast well with the lead characters.

These production values as much as the cultural trappings make *SE7EN* mainstream, at least back in 1995. I also call it mainstream because the film isn't all that bloody or gore-riddled. And with a religious psychopath portrayed as an anti-heroic enforcer, plenty of theists, liberals, and conservatives can enjoy this film. Indeed, *SE7EN* can probably take credit for legitimizing slasher films if nothing else.

*SE7EN* entertains me in the end, though I have to be in the right mood to put up with its trendy nihilism. As any sort of literary fiction--expressing an underlying heart or an important truth about people--the film falls short. Taken as what it is--a mainstream slasher film artifact of mid-nineties American culture--*SE7EN* stands on its own.

101218,5,0790729989,"Se7en is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichs. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.

The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""The Divine Comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.

Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.",1108771200,,2364,5.012722646310433

This movie isn't exactly your ""cliche"" murder mystery ending.  The movie grabs you right from the beginning with that darky, gloomy backround and rainy weather.  I was anticipated to see each deadly sin unraveled throughout the story.  Each sin was maginficently presented in a specific fashion.  Take for instance..Lust.  That was so crazy when Pitt and Freeman went to this underground nightclub/nude bar and loud techno music was blaring in the backround when they saw the dead prostitute and a delirious guy screaming.  The ending was brilliant.  Nobody can ever write a better ending to a story.  The ending pulled me in and never pulled me out.  The movie did something to my head psychologically speaking that I can't ignore.  Pitt unwinded in a frenzy which unfortunately I haven't seen him do in any other films.

101242,5,0790729989,"While many people see this movie as a 'Silence of the Lambs' style psychological horror movie (and being overly grotesque abd graphical for some) - the horror is just a minor aspect of the movie. In a way, it is just a metaphore for our lives today.

The movir centers on the relationship between supposedly opposite detectives - David Mills (Brad Pitt) is still young enough (and inexperienced enough in big city crime)to believe the system works, and that most criminals can be caught if the cops & detectives involved will work hard enough. Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), on the other hand, had more than his share of unsolved, grotesque cases to be weary of the system. His definition of a 'closed case' is when there is nothing more to be done - whether the perpertrator has been caught, or in many of the cases - until there is no way of finding him or her. He's also experienced enough to know that hard work is often not enough, and that the wheels of justiced can work better if they're greased with some bribes somewhere along the way. Unlike Det. Mills, who fights the despair he sees around him by tryingto do his best, Det. Somerset just decide to give up - with so much crime going on around him, what can he do to stop it?

The movie assaults our sense of 'right and wrong'. Just like Det. Mills, we'd like to think everything can be resolved with logic - but are all logical decisions right decisions? The scene between Tracy & Somerset in the diner tries to tell us the opposite.

As the movie progresses, the relationship between the two detectives is getting better - not only are they becoming friends, but also manage to find a way to work well together, and to feed off each other's strength & talents. But this doesn't lead to a happy ending - even though the crime is solved. As the relationship gets better, the murders are becoming stranger, exposing us to seedier & seedier sides of life in the big city.

Looking at the way the movie is shot, NYC is always rainy, wet, neglected. This depressing atmosphere affects the lives of everyone living in it. Even the supposedly 'perfect' relationship between David & Tracy (the highschool sweethearts we'd all like to be) had somehow gone wrong - starting with the 'vibrating apartment', and going through a stage where Tracy doesn't share the secret of herpregnancy & her doubts about it with David.

The ending, on the other hand, occurs in a big, sunny field - the exact opposite of the wet city the characters had just left. But while the city was 'their turf', where they were in control, John Doe is in control of the situation in the field. Once again, our ideals of good & bad (crowded, wet city vs. the big, sunny countryside) are somehow used against us.",1106352000,,2749,4.567951318458418
101243,2,0790729989,"Ok so, being a big wuss and it being late at night/early in the morning when I watched this film, I expected to be terrified. Oh no, not so. I read fantastic reviews about this film (which may be why I was quite so disappointed)and although a wimp, I am not squeamish, so (rightly, I might add) I though I wouldn't be scared by all the nasty ideas. I was right. I wasn't scared. At all. The film is quite engaging, I'll give it that. I love Morgan Freeman, particularly that chocolate smooth voice, but I have to say he really felt like he was faintly joking when he played this role. As always, he was good. But by his standards, he was subpar. This film reminded me of 'Along Came a Spider' - both storylines were weak, Morgan Freeman stood out in both and yet was not as good as he could be. Gwyneth Paltrow was as always pathetic - I have yet to see that woman actually act, as opposed to simply be herself (weak, dismal, not entirely there) on screen. If anybody has any films in which she is worth watching, please tell me as I would actually like to be able to change that rather mean opinion. Anyway, back to the point. Brad Pitt was ok, not terrific. The story itself was absolute crap. Let's be fair here. With most horror films/TV detective dramas, the baddie turns out to be someone who is just random and hasn't been picked up on by the viewer beforehand - this is because in real life, that's what it's actually like. Either that, or the film just tries too hard to point you in the wrong direction so you know for sure that it's the person the film directs you away from (as in Along Came a Spider). In this case, the film tries too hard to make the baddie someone we 'recognise' (the likelihood of the baddie actually being the photographer is so, so small). Although having criticised all horror films, I cannot think of another way it could be done. Make it someone connected to the victim but too random, and everyone will watch it saying 'huh? who the heck is that?!'. Make it someone too obvious and people like me will say 'Ugh. Not again.

I didn't have any clue as to how the movie would end. The whole time I was watching it, I didn't even leave my chair. My heart was just pounding. It just freaked me out. Not a lotta movie would do that. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow give great performances. And the 'John Doe' killer... I won't say who plays him for some of those who haven't seen this movie, but, like his other movies, he gives one helluva great performance. Overall, this is definately a classic.

101246,5,0790729989,"I had to catch my breath...step away from the movie

screen...and totally regroup.  It was that kind of

film.  I've just finished watching what critics

deemed one of the most frightening and disturbing

homicidal maniac films of all time --- Se7en.  And no,

that is not a typo...just a clever marketing tool to

emphasize the meaning of the number and the word -

Se7en.

I don't know where to begin.

I don't want to give away a thing.

I was on the edge of my seat for two hours.

And why not?  Take a look at the cast.  Morgan

Freeman, Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow.  How can you lose?  I can't give away the murderer...it would detract from the horror

of this totally insane film of 1995.  I've had it on

my shelf for over a year and never got around to

watching it until tonight.

Without giving away a single storyline, if you enjoyed

(quivered and shivered) during ""Silence of the Lambs""

or ""Manhunter"", this one is for you.  It builds a plot

like building a 3,000 piece Lego masterpiece.  What

an ending!  To me, it wasn't predicatble...probably

because I am naive when it comes to psychotic

killers...I don't know that many - LOL!

Anyway, let me share a couple of things with you.

First, I won't give away the meaning of the title

""Se7en"".  You will discover that very shortly into the

film.

But let me quote a couple of the lines from the film:

""About the only thing we know about that guy right now

is that he is independently wealthy, well educated,

and TOTALLY INSANE.""

""...because he's John Doe by choice.""

The maniac in this film is ""completing his

masterpiece.""

""The Lord works in mysterious ways.""

With that, ""Se7en"" gets a resounding 6 on a scale of

1-5 (5 being the highest) in the psycho thriller

genre.  I purchased the New Line Platinum Series with

a second DVD with supplemental material.  It contains

alternate endings which I haven't watched yet...but

I'm sure they'll be a treat.

As Halloween approaches, it's the time of year to

watch ""Se7en.""  You'll never read Chaucer with the

same understanding ever again.  Brad Pitt and Morgan

Freeman (the rookie meets the seasoned veteran) are well cast as determined and crafty detectives.  Don't miss

it.

Count to ""Se7en"" and buy this DVD.  You'll watch it more than once.  It is a blood-curdling masterpiece.",1097884800,3,2316,4.615960099750623

101248,3,0790729989,"After reading all of the many and sundry reviews for Se7en, I was ready for something really dark, really disturbing, really stylized. I was ready to be wowed. Maybe I'm just another member of the titillation generation, but I saw nothing here that was any more interesting than any number of other thrillers or dramas.

Some notes: For a film that has generated so many ""gore"" complaints, there is almost no gore or violence here. Only two of the murders are fully realized as setpieces, the rest are glossed over. In once scene, dozens of squad cars and a laser-guided-weapon-armed SWAT team are sent in to search for one suspect named ""John Doe."" This alone should tell you a lot of what you need to know about this film. Despite the ""cleverness"" everyone talks about, the film isn't even tidy; there are eight deaths (assuming that Brad Pitt's character is executed), not seven.

I guess I just expected much, much more. Sorry, but this film just isn't that dark, isn't that dreary, mainly because it overplays/under-respects its hand. It would have been better with less ""action,"" fewer weepy scenes with underdeveloped characters, and fewer cliches. It would also have been better if more time were given to the seven deadly sins setpieces.

I was hoping for a film that really brought the potential of the premise to fruition... seven deadly sins, seven truly horrific setpieces and a baroque, gothic, noir feel. Instead, we get seven deadly sins but only two murder setpieces, one extra murder that's just for the hell of it, one pregnancy subplot, a Cracker Jack box prize for a detective story, and a gimmicky ending. I've much had darker, more dreary afternoons at the city Zoo.

Bleh. Three stars for nice cinematography and for the basic premise, which is still excellent. I'd like to see someone with real talent rewrite/reshoot this one and take it to a better and/or more consistent, stronger conclusion.",1095638400,2,1920,4.880368098159509

The Beavis & Butthead thing that Freeman and Pitt had going just didn't work at all. Kevin Spacey's eventual arrival brightened things slightly, but it was far too little, far too late.  Well, I'll admit I might've grinned or chuckled just a little a few times.  The fat man being forced to eat himself to death made me smirk, as did the lady getting her face cut up. And I'll admit that I did laugh out loud once during the decapitation part, but that's kinda cheap because decapitation is always funny.

In the Clinton 90's the maniac murderers are in control.  Morgan Freeman is reluctant to barge into the killer's apartment because he doesn't have a warrant.  Brad Pitt barges in with Dirty Harry force, but by the end of the movie he has been coerced by the murderer's cunning.  It wasn't Clinton's fault he lost control in the Oval office, and it's not Brad's fault he loses it either.

Either way, this isn't a happy movie. It's about two detectives who follow the trail of a mysterious ""John Doe"" who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins. Disturbing and disgusting crime scenes are discovered throughout the movie as the detectives figure out John Doe's system.

 I loved this film. I thought although it was very disturbing at times, it is also very well done. David Fincher's dark film style really shows and benefits the film. The actors were perfectly cast, Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset, and Brad Pitt as detective Mills.

 I think that one will either love this film or hate it because of its brutal nature. Before one can judge it though, one must give it a fair chance. 5 stars, it's brutal, but it's good.

In case you don't know:
The plot:  Mysterious serial killer murders victims based on the seven deadly sins.
-greed, lust, pride, gluttony, sloth, vanity, and wrath.
The characters: Hot-headed rookie detective played by Pitt  +  Refined, calm, and intelligent veteren detective played by Morgan Freeman.
The killer:  Well, it's supposed to be a surprise since his name wasn't even in the opening credits.
Conclusion:  I wasn't kidding about the ending.  It's not cupcakes and roses.  I remember seeing this on the opening night in the theater.  As the credits rolled, there was no talking as people exited the theater.  Actually most people didn't move for a couple of minuets.  Only pale terrified faces across the masses.

Cast:  Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, John C. McGinley, Kevin Spacey.
Running Time:  127 minutes.
Rated R for extreme violence, gore, and language.
One of the most gruesome, yet intriguing mystery/suspense thrillers of the past decade, ""Seven"" is widely considered one of the best of its kind-and rightfully so.  It is a film that will test the stomachs of all its viewers, yet even those who feel queasy throughout the entire picture stay engaged because of the impeccable acting, top-notch direction, and riveting cinematography.
Detective William Somerset (a stupendous, touching performance from the always admirable Morgan Freeman) is looking forward to retirement-he has had it with all the horror, stress, and dead partners that accompany his job.  His young protg, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), is looking forward to follow in his footsteps, but realizes that his feet are in too deep as a serial killer who calls himself ""John Doe"" begins to parade around the city-killing each of his victims in a pattern that references to the seven deadly sins.  As both detectives uncover more of the truth about the horrific killer, they become entangled in a ghoulish scheme that will shock them.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a fine performance as Mills's distressed wife.
Director David Fincher creates a dark and disturbing film, using Freeman and Pitt well (both give slightly dark, somber performances) to his advantage.  The unique camera angles, explosive chase sequences, and vivid crime scenes enhance the picture, making ""Seven"" an inimitable thriller that is so effective, powerful, and alarming that it will scare your socks right off.  The finale is one of the most electrifying of all time, pitting Pitt (no pun intended) against the evil murderer in an emotional, unforgettable showdown.  A rare cinematic experience that will make you have nightmares for weeks-but enjoy every second of it.  The Platinum Series DVD is phenomenal, which includes many deleted scenes, alternate endings, and a DVD-rom exclusive that allows you to look into the killer's mind.  A captivating, spellbinding look at how the horrors of society can simply drive an ordinary man mad.",1085875200,,2203,5.28080229226361

Morgan Freeman consolidates his reputation as a consummate performer, playing the methodical, patient foil to Pitt's volatile man of action.
However, Se7en isn't just a straightforward thriller about the hunt for a serial killer. On that level it works brilliantly, but it goes beyond that. Imagine how disquieting it is to find that you share a common viewpoint with a character who has done so many sickening things. I don't ever recall seeing a film which provoked such a reaction in me.

Watching the slow build up as they uncover the wretched crimes of Kevin Spacey, in a chilling performance as John Doe, is a study in not being able to look away from something horrible.  Filmed almost entirely in dank, dark, raining atmosphere similar to `The Ring' the oppression hangs in the air.

101309,5,0790729989,". . . and much more of a character study, 'Se7en' is the perfect vehicle for the arrival of director David Fincher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker.  What makes this film great is director David Fincher's attention to detail, screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker's ability to turn the buddy/cop drama on it's head, and Oscar-calibre performances by Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, and especially Morgan Freeman.
SPOILERS:
Great script.  As you probably already know, the serial killer (whose real name IS ""John Doe""), causes the deaths of several individuals who are most obviously guilty of the mortal sins - gluttony (a morbidly obese man is forced to eat himself to death), greed (a slimy criminal lawyer is forced to remove ""a pound a flesh""), sloth (a pedophile, drug dealer/addict is tied to his bed to waste away for a year before he is found), pride (a model who is so ugly on the inside that she decides to kill herself rather than be ugly on the outside), and lust (a married john is forced to ""drill"" a prostitute).  More subtly, however, Walker creates a parallel between two seemingly opposite characters - Detective Sommerset (who is retiring out of a sense resignation toward the sick world we live in) and ""John Doe"" (who is committing the serial murders more as punctuation marks in a message to the world the only way he know to make it listen - with a ""sledgehammer"").  Narratively speaking, as Detective Sommerset is going out the revolving door, the young Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) is coming in.  Although the angry, vengeful cop has been overplayed as the hero in countless numbers of genre films since 'Dirty Harry', Walker brilliantly shines a light on that character's own mortal sin - wrath - as being no more or less worth of attrition than the sins of the criminals that such cops usually vanquish in these films.  Of course, John Doe (Kevin Spacey in a sparse, but no less effective, role) saves attrition for the final sin for himself - an individual who honestly envies the ignorant bliss of the common man.  What is most refreshing about this script is that the ""bad guy"" runs the narrative - the cops never have control.
Great directing.  Motivated by a disappointing directorial experience ('Alien 3'), Fincher pulls no punches to make 'Seven' noir to the extreme.  Even the most casual viewer will note that until the end of the film, it is contiuously raining.  In terms of overall effect, the attention to detail is, quite simply, outstanding.
Great acting.  Morgan Freeman was so compelling as the philosophical, but jaded detective that he would create his own typcast ('Kiss the Girls', 'Along Came a Spider').  Brad Pitt may not have been stretching too much as the angry young man, but the final scene where the phases of anger and sadness watch over his face is one of the greatest moments he has ever put to film.  Finally, you cannot say enough about Kevin Spacey, whose appearance in the last quarter of the film is a minimal one, but no less powerful than Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter.",1082419200,,3031,4.794625719769674
101310,5,0790729989,"""Se7en"" can clearly be counted among the tops in the murder/mystery thriller type movies of all time as it is an extremely intense film that frightens the soul and fills the entertainment need for such movies.  Fair warning to the faint of heart as the graphics of this film are just as intense as the script itself.  Much of this film is based on the script being as intense as it as the two primary characters are trying to figure out who the killer is before he/she makes it all the way through the seven deadly sins; what I find difficult to believe when watching the film though is that the screenwriter felt it was necessary to resort to excessive bouts of cursing as opposed to reasonably intelligent verbiage.  I'm far from being a prude of any sort however, a thing can be taken too far and the language of this film was taken too far too often.
Performance wise, what else can be expected of Morgan Freeman other than another marvelous performance!  There are very few films in which he's starred that one could say weren't good films and parts for him; he continues to be one of the top actors in the industry.  Brad Pitt gives another great performance in this film despite his part being the one in which the screenwriter overindulged in a lack of intelligent writing.  Kevin Spacey's actual screen time is very limited in this film but his performance is extremely powerful.  Gwyneth Paltrow, such the beauty that she is, has a limited role in the film but leaves an impression nonetheless.
Director David Fincher who is probably best known for such films as the more recent ""Fight Club"" and ""Panic Room"" shows an exceptional stylistic flair in ""Seven"" that carries over to his other films.  He certainly deserves a fair amount of credit for this films success over the years.
The Premise:
New York City's finest, Detective Lieutenant William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) finds himself mired in an investigation of a serial killer only one week from retirement.  In comes his replacement, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) who is eager to take over the case all on his own however, their Captain played by the high spirited retired Marine Corps Staff Sergeant turned Hollywood actor, R. Lee Ermey, refuses to just hand the case over to Mills.
What follows from there is an extremely intense film in which the two detectives are desperately trying to find a killer who is forcing his victims to more or less kill themselves based on the seven deadly sins before he makes it all the way through them...
I highly recommend this film to any and all who are interested in this particular genre of filmmaking as it is, as stated above, an extremely intense thriller type film that will keep one guessing all the way to the extraordinarily frightening conclusion.  {ssintrepid}
Special Features:
The one true incongruity of this particular original DVD release of the film is that it is a two sided disc that only contains about half the film on the first side.  I don't know where New Line came up with their compression rate for this film and why but very few videophiles, myself included, are appreciative of having to flip a disc to continue the movie!

101321,4,0790729989,"One of Morgan Freeman's best roles. The acting by everyone was superb. The tension builds and just when you think it's over, there's a twist. The ending has to be seen to be believed.",1079308800,,183,4.411764705882353
101322,2,0790729989,"First off, the good: This movie set a cinematographic standard for urban gothic-thrillers. The film presents its metropolis as a grity Daedalian labrynth in which around each dark corner some human vice is manifesting itself in macabre excess. It is grity, claustrophobic, and dark. Lights pulsate a sickly yellow, tight focus keeps the dark a mystery and the constant darkness implies a godless world were hedonistic lifestyles lead to extremes of degradation. Humanity is slitting its wrists. The movie's production design and cinematography are interesting, intimidating and perfect for the theme.
Now, the bad: That is all Se7en is! Se7en's best points are its darkness, its credits and the clever use of ""7"" in place of ""v""! All other elements of the movie fall under ""the bad""; The plot, the characters, the atempts at tenstion, the dialogue and the direction.
  The Plot: A clearly extremely deranged man is going around killing people in graphic parodies of The Seven Deadly Sins. The end! That's it! The police investigation into his murders is superficial and reveals no methods the police might use to identify the killer. Furthermore the several instances where Morgan Freeman suggests exploring literary sources for
clues as to what the murderer's goals might be or who he will kill next never reveal any new information to the viewer, and they seem not to convey information to the characters either. The only ""revelation""(excuse the Biblicality of this wording) made by the detectives is that the killer is killing in ways relating to the Seven Deadly Sins, and we can understand that from the title!
  The plot of the police investigation merely serves as a frame story to reveal each gruesome set peice of the murders. Admit it to yourself, all the time when the cops were pointlesly delineating upon how to find the killer- you were begging to be shown the next murder. The enjoyment of this movie comes from the viewers inherint interst in thr perverse fetisism of torture. We want to skip over the cops and look more at the murders. They intrigue us, the story does not.
  *spoiler* We end up routing for the murderer, in whose capture the movie even concedes the superflous nature of the plot, having him turn himself over.*spoiler ended*

  Somewhat interesting is the identity of the actor who plays the killer, even though everyone knows who it is, I won't reveal it. It the concealment of his identity is a nice, campy throwback to gimmick movies(which this is essentially) and monster picks( like Frankenstein).
  The characters: Morgan Freeman is the jaded veteran cop and Brad Pitt is the hotshot newby. The end! Interstingly enough not only are these the characters in EVERY other psychological thriller, but it is also the character Morgan Freeman plays in EVERY other psychological thriller. Their characterization is summed up in one seen where Brad Pitt decides to drink Beer and Morgan Freman decides to drink wine. Genius!
  Tension: Fast forward to the last 3 minutes of the film and wait for your heartrate to raise about 1/10 past its normal rate. The end situation of the movie provides some tension, but no mystery as to what the outcome will be due to the two-dimensionality of the characters. One other scene which could be suspensful, a chase, is left predictable and uninspiring due to the almost cartoonish way in which it was shot.
  Dialogue: Because the characters and plot are secondary to the gruesome props of the murders all dialogue is stunted and cliched.
  Direction: Other than the depiciton of the murders the direction is loose and meandering. David Fincher knew as we did that the plot was just to provide a frame story to exhibit the murders in and thus guides as adequately enough, but in a very straight and unabitious way, though the poor dialogue and dismal atempts at characterization.

  Conclusion: The film is enjoyable, yes. It is enjoyable in a voyeuristic way. We feel sick pleasure in such extreme representations of cruelty( this is the reason we all know what Chinese water torture is). The film is nothing else though, and does not push the genre in any way. The characters are two-dimensional and the plot paper thin. See it qith friends for fun, but expect nothing as interesting as The Silence of The Lambs. It is gruesome for the sake of showing us gruesomeness.",1078876800,7,4341,4.920547945205479
101323,4,0790729989,seven is one of those movies that gets under ur skin and is gut wrenching it is clever and it provides a few jumps here and there. there is no way u can leave this movie not feeling at least a little disturbed.this is a great phsychological thriller,1077494400,,249,4.208333333333333
101324,5,0790729989,"David Fincher's suspenseful and gritty thriller grips you, leaving you speechless and pondering once the end credits have finished rolling, even while watching the supplements. With its dark and morbid atmosphere and the uncompromising down-beat ending it will leave you thinking about what just sped by you. Harsh and real, ""Se7en"" is a homicide thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat for its entire running length, and it will not fail to impress its disturbing mood upon you, sending shivers and chills down your spine.
Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play as a pair of homicide detectives on a quest to solve a mysterious series of murders. Lt. Somerset (Freeman) is a burnt-out veteran cop on the brink of his retirement when he is teamed up with his replacement, an ambitious and fervent Brad Pitt as Detective David Mills. Two worlds collide as they struggle to accept each other even as a serial killer haunts the streets of this unnamed city, taking upon himself the burden of the Hand of God. He commits various creative punishments on people he feels exemplify the nature of the seven deadly sins. It takes all of the detectives' experience and effort to track the bloody trail of John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who in turn enjoys toying with the cops, planting clues as part of his deadly vision.
Fincher's world is dark, gray and foreboding through most of the movie and destroys any hope you might have for this urban civilization. Even the opening credits are murky, jerky, near-subliminally interspersed with disturbing crime-scene photos. Drenching rain is falling from depressingly cloudy gray skies for most of the movie, underscoring the unhealthy and fatalistic nature of this picture. ""Se7en's"" claustrophobic urban world rustles with cockroaches, and is filled with piles of rotten junk to the point that you can almost smell the putrid air. When the scenes begin to brighten and we finally move into broad daylight, it is only for the most gripping climax suspense cinema has seen in a long time, in a counterpoint revealing the abominable abyss of the dark and masochistic soul of the killer.",1077235200,,2122,4.946778711484594
101325,4,0790729989,"Seven is a film that is built on mood and performance. The movie for all intensive purposes shows just one murder happen on screen and that's by gunshot. What makes this movie so disturbing to people is it leaves a lot up to the imagination which is a much stronger tool. What the movie expertly does is set a mood by the way it's shot, by the constant raining and darkly lit, dunging sets, and an eerie soundtrack. It also sports one of the most distubing opening credit sequences which the filmmakers put a lot of thought and time into.
I liked that the movie focused not on delivering shocking moments but on themes of the human condition. Each of the main three characters presents a different viewpoint of life and purpose. What may disturb people most is that even the seriel killer makes a compelling arguement (in a sick way) and is guided by a deep rooted conviction.
If you like movies with happy endings do not see this film. This film was not made to have you leave with a smile. It does make you think however. I respect what the film accomplishes and the amount of care and detail that the filmmakers poured into this project and for that I give it four stars.
A note on the DVD --- It is one of the best out there in terms of presentation and special edition material. However, the alternnate ending is terrible. First off it is in storyboard form, secondly in is only slightly different but enough to be aweful so don't have your hopes up for something great in that regard.",1075507200,,1490,4.421818181818182
101326,3,0790729989,"I know what you're thinking - how can I give 3 stars to a film that I called ""fantastically well-made"" and that has a wide array of DVD extras?  Because technical skill is not enough - the film must be worthwhile viewing and certainly must not let me down at the end.
The good points: Director Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji  deserve special mention for making the film dark, moody, and of exactly the right pitch for the material.  Although I couldn't tell on my system (I don't have surround sound), I'm told that the sound itself is worth the price of the DVD.  Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are perfect, as is the ""guest star"" serial killer, whose name I won't reveal because it's a neat surprise (his name is not given in the opening credits so it's not for me to reveal his name, although other reviews do).  The idea is creative - a serial killer ""sermon"" on the deadly sins.  Many have commented on how disturbing the film is, which is true, but not any more so than some true story serial killers, and I would have no problem recommending the film to others (but take the R-rating very seriously!)
However....  At the end of the film, for all its technical skill, I was not left with the impression that the experience was worthwhile.  The more I thought about it, the less I liked the ending and the protrayal of the serial killer.  Some of the murders (e.g. greed and sloth) are grisly, but not really poetic justice.  Likewise, the ending is very irritating.  Not so much for its predictability, but for the fact that it cheats.  Count up the number of murders at the end, and you don't get seven.  I have other objections, but they would require revealing too much, so I won't post them here.
Seven is one of these moody pieces where the audience is jerked around but where it should all come together at the end.  Think about two films with some of the same stars, namely 12 Monkeys and The Usual Suspects: the endings of these films are consistent with the buildup and don't cheat the audience.  Seven does cheat, so it loses status in my star rating.
The DVD edition is quite a good package.  There are 4 audio commentaries, although most of them (and many of the other extras) are technical in nature.  One entire commentary is devoted to the sound alone!  My favourite extra - cut and/or alternate scenes - is interesting, especially the original opening sequence of the film and the subplot it generated.  There is also an alternate ending that was storyboarded, which contains an interesting difference from the one that was filmed.",1074816000,2,2563,4.568927789934355
101327,4,0790729989,"Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt make a dynamic combination, one old and cynical, the other young and idealistic. Both come to grips with personal demons, while hunting a serial killer who is not in a hurry. Kevin Spacey gives one of his most chilling performances. Visually graphic, it keeps you guessing right to the end. Bless me Father for I have sinned.",1074556800,6,354,4.725806451612903
101328,5,0790729989,"There are only a handful of films that are good enough for me to benchmark the experience of seeing them in the theater.  Se7en is one of those movies.  I saw the film for the first time with a group of friends on a college trip.  We went into the film laughing and joking, and when we emerged, we were all totally silent for at least fifteen minutes.  We were still recovering from the shock of this film, the benchmark by which I have since judged all suspense thrillers.
The film is exceptionally well-written, merging classical elements of the ars praedicandi (the ancient teaching texts to which Freeman's character refers in the film), with Dante's Inferno, and Milton's Paradise Lost with a serial murder investigation in a modern metro area.  While the exact location is nondescript, the location is simultaneously nowhere and everywhere, thus making this ""everycity"" that much more disturbing.
Freeman is brilliantly cast as the aging, jaded Detective Somerset, ready to retire, while Brad Pitt makes the perfect brash foil to Freeman's Somerset.  A character study in contrast, Pitt's impulsive irreverence keeps the viewer engaged and entertained, while Freeman's brooding Somerset provides necessary exposition and grounds the story with his shrewd, patient omniscience.

Kevin Spacey's John Doe is one of the most frightening villans to have ever graced the screen, not merely because of the horrible murders the character commits, but because of the character's cool amorality regarding his own actions.  Gwyneth Paltrow and Leland Orser also make appearances in gut-wrenching supporting roles.
Not intended for those who are pregnant or nursing or for those who have heart or kidney conditions, this film will grab your viscera and twist them until you want to beg for mercy, then make you want to come back for more.  This is more than just another genre film.  It redefines the suspense/thriller genre, and its brutal ending becomes only marginally less upsetting on subsequent viewings.
The Platinum Edition DVD is a must in this case.  With digitally enhanced negative transfer, digitally remastered surround sound, and loads of special features, the film finally looks and sounds like the masterpiece it is.  If you only saw this movie in the theater, you have not seen this film the way Fincher intended it to be seen.
Fincher's commentary track is, like the commentary on Fight Club, thoroughly entertaining and enlightening, and he has gone into the vault to provide us with an alternate opening sequence, as well as a coda-less ending, and a vastly different storyboarded ending that was never filmed.  Only special feature that could have easily been omitted is Morgan Freeman's whiny, self-absorbed commentary track.  I respect Freeman immensely as an actor, but he's rather annoying when allowed to ramble on unscripted.
Another one of the best films of the 1990s, the Platinum Series version of Se7en is a must for any DVD collection!",1073952000,2,2962,5.130977130977131
101329,5,0790729989,"This Movie is in the top Ten. I really enjoyed it. It kept you waiting to see what was going to happen next. You have Morgan Freeman,Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow and of course Kevin Spacey one of the best cast to be put together. Great job.
  It's was a dark,chilling thriller filled with suspense. A great plot! Gives you the ending of what happens in the last half hour, but no one catch's on until the end,I didn't and i love it , A must see. You won't fall asleep in this one , but sweet dreams.",1073779200,3,497,4.11340206185567
101350,3,0790729989,"I originally watched this film a few years ago, and found it too terrifying, and vowed never to watch it again. The ending was the main part that freaked me out. I bought it on DVD for Christmas and decided to take a chance and watch it again. To my surprise, I found it less scary, more enjoyable, and I didn't remember any of it. I'd obviously blocked a lot of it out!
There are a lot of clichs in this film. The old cop near retiring partnered with the young cop, with a thirst for blood; you know something's going to happen to the young couple who look into each others eyes lovingly - especially when the wife can't find the right moment to tell her husband she's pregnant - and the fact it seems to be constantly raining. It always seems to be raining in cop films, which makes the film even darker.
All of the actors do a great job. Morgan Freeman is his usual self, never smiling, although it was great to hear him laughing in this film - I don't think I've ever heard that before. Brad Pitt was looking rather fine in this, especially when he got rained on. Gwyneth Paltrow was pretty and rather underused and there was some unusual chemistry between her and Brad - considering they were dating around this time.
This film isn't for the faint-hearted. I didn't find it as scary second time round, although I had a cushion handy just in case. OK, it's a story about murders based on the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and wrath. So prepare yourself for the unexpected! Look out for the lust murder, as I found that to be the worst of the seven. Any female out there will be wincing, crossing her legs, and never wanting to let a guy near her again! Ouch to say the least.
This film will leave you guessing right up until the last minute - and at just two hours long, that's a lot of minutes to be guessing who the killer is! It's a good film, although I couldn't watch it more than once. Maybe again in another couple of years, and I haven't been refusing to watch it because of the ending which wasn't what I remembered/imagined it to be!",1072396800,,2079,4.292620865139949
101351,1,0790729989,"Pitt, never what you would really call an actor, turns in a performance here that is nothing short of amazing, if you rule out the fact that no police department in the country would hire someone with Tourette's who appears to neither shave nor bathe very often.
The storyline has all the depth and literacy of the last fourteen slasher movies you saw, which is appropriate because this is basically a fancy slasher movie.
Morgan Freeman basically provides the only element of sanity in this movie.  He often looks at Pitt in disbelief as though he were thinking, ""They pay you to do this?""
Putrid, disgusting, formless, meaningless, and needlessly excessive, this is an example of modern Hollywood at its worst. Avoid at all costs.",1071619200,17,732,4.856

Did ya vomit after every scene?  These top 500 and top 1000 reviewers piss me off.  They don't even get paid to review these movies, and yet they still trash them like they're the caliber of Roger Ebert.  Wake up call.
Here we go, if you haven't seen this movie, you either: A. Have a low tolerance for the grotesque, B. You don't like suspense films, or C. you read some retard's review about how no one should see this movie.  If you said C, congrats, your a retard as well.  I can understand A and B, I have no beef with them, but it's the C category that pisses me off.
So as not to completely miss the point, I will now review this movie.
The best movie EVER and I do mean EVER.  The only movie that comes close is Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, but that's a different review for a different time.
Tell me the plot you ask?  No, why give away the plot to the best movie ever?  Does that make sense people?  No, I will tell you though, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt give believable and truly stunning performances.  Keven Spacey shows why he is one of the best out there.  Paltrow's role, though small, is well acted and thoroughly believable.
Now your asking me, what is the movie about?  No, you won't get it out of me, the plot is too good.  If you seriously know nothing about this movie, perfect, buy it, watch it, love it.  I have this DVD, and I have watched well over 20 times, probably more, it's just that good (also I have a high tolerence for the grotesque, which is why I can watch ""Natural Born Killers"" repeatedly, another great film by genius film maker Oliver Stone).

I found myself deeply involved with every aspect of this film from the beginning to the brilliant ending. The more you watch this film the more you grow to appreciate the intellegent writting and directing that makes Se7en what it is.
Morgan Freeman is outstanding (as always) playing the embittered Det. Somerset who can't wait to retire and Brad Pitt is his equal playing Det. Mills, a new detective to the area who wants to save the world. Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, and R. Lee Ermey are also great as the supporting cast.
The concept is one of the most original that I have seen or read in a long time. Although many were put off by the constant dreary surroundings and the extremely cruel and unusual killings I think this is what makes the movie. I admit that one has to cringe at some of the horrific acts of violence on the part of the serial killer but this is what brings it home to the audience. This film makes you think about human nature in more ways than one which makes the brutality of the killings almost less in comparison to the psychological effects left on all the characters (and audience) involved.
Se7en has set the bar for all future films in this genre to look up to. I'm sure if you view this film you will be just as enthralled as I was.

The day after, another kill, this time with the word ""greed"" makes them think about the seven deadly sins and five more assassinates to be done. That week will affect these two people in a big way. It develops the connection between them. Pitt's character is younger and more impatient, something not appreciated by the other, who is going to retire after this affair. Gwyneth Paltrow also stars in with the portrayal of Pitt's wife. She always seems miserable and worried about her husband. The menace of the freak is over all the time.
This movie fascinated me so, quite more than Fight Club (although you should aso take a look to this other one). First of all, I think the plot is perfect: a murderer obsession about bad people and punishing them by each capital sin they accomplish. I liked a lot this character, quite well performed by Kevin Spacey, because of his sordid behaviour. Besides, the two detectives will find many surprises, like for example, spectacles drawn on a portrait or the awful vision of a man trapped so long with nothing to eat, but his own tongue!. Fincher's brilliant direction gives a sorrowful view of life, because of all these terrible killings and the feeling that all the bad is always present. Despite what Freeman says at the end, when I finished watching this movie, it gave me the impression that the world is a dark and suffering place,. However, in my opinion, it's one of the best thrillers ever created, and if you like this genre, you MUST buy it. My favourite scene is the final one of the tense conversation with the freak and the painful end, it's wonderfully good!

I always love movies that keep both sides interesting. Movies containing murder tend to make the maniac exactly that, ow yeah they try to make him sound intelligent but they usually fail miserably and fall into the silent whisper/calm voice routine, Spacey takes this to a whole new level actually admitting his mistake and getting pissed off at some point.
Appart from the exceptional acting and the interesting and usually ""loaded"" dialogue the plot is the real masterpiece of this movie, I am not a religious person, but I identify with the killer a lot more then I do with the detectives allthough they stay interesting.

(USA - 1995)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS

On the eve of retirement, a world-weary cop (Morgan Freeman) teams up with his younger replacement (Brad Pitt) in the hunt for a monstrous serial killer whose crimes are based on the seven deadly sins.

Dark, gruesome shocker which set director David Fincher on the road to Hollywood glory following an inauspicious debut with the half-baked sci-fi shocker ALIEN. Freeman loans dramatic weight to the proceedings as a burnt-out cop struggling to make sense of the horrors he has witnessed during his long career, and Pitt distances himself from the 'pretty-boy' roles in which he had become typecast by playing a complex, headstrong character whose flaws lead to a devastating climactic 'twist'. The drama unfolds in an unnamed city where moral values have been replaced by human apathy and excess, allowing the killer at the heart of the story to fester unnoticed, until his monstrous scheme begins to overwhelm the central characters. In fact, Andrew Kevin Walker's ingenious script works both as a police procedural and as an examination of society's moral vacuum, though the downbeat ending may strike some as too neat and cynical for its own good.

The movie is quite shocking in places - the killing derived from the sin of 'lust' is particularly degrading - though it's also quite playful in its own twisted fashion (note, for instance, how the constant rainfall surrenders to bright sunlight for the horrific finale), and Darius Khondji's elegant widescreen cinematography often belies the movie's grim subject matter. A triumph for all concerned, this is as close as 1990's Hollywood ever came to a 'daring' mainstream blockbuster, and nervous viewers are urged to avoid at all costs.",1054857600,,1791,5.140893470790378

101381,4,0790729989,"""Seven"" is a movie that really gets under your skin, and it's not easily forgotten. David Fincher's dark and violent thriller about a serial killer who kills by the 7 deadly sins is a rewarding experience, provided you can stomach it. The acting from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as police partners carries the movie, while the suspense keeps you on edge from start to finish.
The New Line DVD is loaded with (mostly) quality extras. You can expect to see the movie four times just for the commentary, the best of which are from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. David Fincher is a bore, on the other hand, speaking mostly in monotone and rambling on for too long. The suppliments on disc 2 cover almost every aspect of the movie, from a featurette on the opening title sequence (which is very good by the way), to deleted scenes and alternate endings in storyboard format. I found the alternate endings the most interesting since I absolutely hated the one that made it into the movie.
Perhaps the most interesting suppliment is the photo galleries. The production team went all out the make the photographs as unpleasant as possible. There is a collection of gruesome crime scene photos with commentary from director of photography, you may want to take a shower after viewing these-they're nasty. Also included are John Doe's notebooks and ""Sloth"" victim decomposition photos for good measure. The galleries alone make this worth checking out, as it's hard not to appreciate the work that went into them. Rounding out the extras are the usual promotional fodder that is good for a one-time glance, but is otherwise nothing special.
""Seven"" is a great movie that gets the DVD release it deserves. Though it is not for every taste, it is a fun and rewarding experience. Fans will undoubtedly love the extras.",1053302400,6,1805,4.807073954983923
101382,3,0790729989,"Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are cops on the prowl for a serial killer who chooses his victims from the ""Se7en"" deadly sins.  Much has been written to both bally-hoo and criticize this disturbing thriller.  In point of fact, there's not much to the story but hey, style goes a long, long way and this movie has style down pat.  There's something unsettling in the dreary, dark and haunted cinematography that makes even a public library or police station seem like the most frightening place on earth to be.  The chemistry between Freeman and Pitt is highly toxic.  Gwenyth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey costar.
Unfortunately, for those who have been waiting to toss out their old flipper disc of this movie, I wouldn't be rushing out to the resale shop just yet.  Although there are definite advantages to not having to turn over your disc in the middle of the movie, this new edition of ""Se7en"" still suffers from a host of DVD mastering problems.  First there is edge enhancement to contend with.  At times it is nonexistant.  Then suddenly, there it is, excessive and distracting and making a mess out of the visual information presented on the screen.  Aliasing and shimmering of fine details also do this hit and miss throughout the movie.  A real shame since color rendering, shadow delineation and fine details throughout this disc are superbly rendered. Remember that this is an extremely dark visual experience.  The DVD's ability to retain depth and clarity throughout is remarkable.  The soundtrack is remastered in 5.1 and wonderfully vibrant in all of its sustained and low key ambiance.
Extras: An audio commentary and some toss away features that really don't enhance the over all viewing experience.  Really, they're not worth discussing.

It breaks all the rules from start to finish.  This is one of the few movies that make you squirm in your seat with what it does not show you.  Suspense and a forboding sense of doom takes ahold of you during the beginning credits and do not let go.  Not for the faint of heart.  Kevin Spacey deserved an Academy Award for his portrayal of John Doe.  He played the type of killer that would have Hannibal Lector looking over his shoulder.",1049760000,,590,4.261261261261262
101384,5,0790729989,"Brilliant mainstream movies seem to be increasingly rare these days, but ""Seven"" is surely one that will stand the test of time.  Direcotr David Fincher, with help from a terrific ensemble cast, crafted a dark, uncompromising look at the moral failings of contemporary American society.  This is not a happy movie, and you won't feel any better after watching it, but it'll certainly make you think.  On one level, ""Seven"" is a mystery/suspense movie, and an excellent one at that.  The plot, which I'm sure most are familiar with by now, concerns two cops, Brad Pitt's youthful Mills and Morgan Freeman's aging Somerset, on the trail of a serial killer.  As the movie develops, it turns out that the killer is basing his murders on the seven deadly sins, and finding a fiendish way to turn each one against the sinner.  Although this concept is exceedingly clever, it wouldn't make a classic movie on its own.  What elevates ""Seven"" above the heap is that it exploits the allegorical potential of its subject to the fullest.  More than just a simple crime drama, ""Seven"" is a modern morality tale for our troubled times.  The lead characters, Mills and Somerset, become representatives for two competing viewpoints.  The young Mills still thinks he can make a difference through his work, but the soon-to-retire Somerset has allowed himself to become jaded by the constant apathy he sees in society.  Unfortunately, it seems that Somerset's view has the weight of evidence behind it.  And then there's the killer, played in truly unsettling fashion by Kevin Spacey (back when he was still an excellent character actor and not a failed leading man).  Spacey's John Doe doesn't show up until there's about a half-hour left in the movie, but during his brief role he OWNS the screen.  When he explains the rationale behind his killings, it's pretty near impossible not to think about what he says.  Fincher's noirish direction tops it all off, creating a dark and oppressive atmosphere that perfectly complements the movie's subject matter.  If you're anything like me, you'll be rather depressed after watching ""Seven,"" but you'll be wiser for it.",1049587200,,2146,4.969187675070028

This movie is a psychological thriller in which a serial killer kills his victims by using the seven deadly sins: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed, and sloth. Of course you're disturbed by the killings and dark, damp feel of the movie, but you also learn about the message that the killer was ultimately trying to relay - although he didn't have to kill to get his point across.
Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman did great jobs playing the lead characters, and Kevin Spacey is chilling as the killer. This is definitely a movie you want to watch with a friend and with the lights on!",1049241600,,673,4.616666666666666
101386,5,0790729989,"In the best tradition of psychological horror that claims such memorable classics as ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Psycho"", and ""The Silence of the Lambs""- this film will haunt viewers well beyond the final credits.  Director David Fincher skillfully constructs all the elements of suspense in this tale about a serial killer obsessed with the seven deadly sins:  gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and lust. The two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) tracking him become equally obsessed - with capturing the killer before he completes his seven murders.  Freeman and Pitt have great on-screen chemistry that lends a gritty reality to the script.
Despite the gruesome plot, this film has an elegance rarely encountered in a commercial film. The suspense is beautifully taut - I caught myself literally holding my breath during certain parts. The pacing is deliberate but never slack, giving the viewer over two hours of intense drama.
Turn down the lights, jack up the surround sound, and settle into this tense thriller.  (And make sure you're not alone!)",1047513600,,1063,5.1988304093567255
101387,5,0790729989,"Director David Fincher made up for his dreadful directorial debut Alien 3 with this superbly crafted thriller that became the most unnerving serial killer film since The Silence of the Lambs.  Veteran detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is teamed with young detective Mills (Brad Pitt) to track a serial killer who is basing his murders on the seven deadly sins.  Freeman and Pitt are both great in they're respective roles, but Gwyneth Paltrow is mostly wasted as Pitt's wife.  The best performance however goes to Kevin Spacey as John Doe, the seemingly insane killer that we soon find out may not be so insane after all.  This is where Fincher began to display the skills of the type of director he would become in his later films like Fight Club and Panic Room.  The look of the film honestly, is pretty depressing, but that mood sets the tone of Seven perfectly, and the atmosphere of the film carries a sense of dread almost throughout the entire film.  Freeman's characterization of the weathered and disenchanted Somerset is one of his best roles in his distinguished career.  Pitt's characterization of a hot headed cop is one of his better roles as well, but as I said before, Kevin Spacey gives the best performance of the film and is purely chilling.  What makes John Doe chilling however, is not his crimes, but the fact that when he speaks his reasons why, he makes a frightening sense of it.  The DVD itself is packed with extras including four seperate commentaries and an alternate ending (plus an un-shot ending done with storyboards) along with tons more, and is possibly New Line's best produced DVD to date.  All in all, consider this essential viewing.",1046736000,2,1674,4.801393728222997

Whether its the directorial genious of David Fincher or the great performances turned in by all the cast members it is an all around excellent movie. The general plotline (without giving too much away) is about a serial killer who kills his victims because they simplify the seven deadly sins. While it can be a pretty gruesome movie at times it is something that everyone should see. David Fincher gets overlooked quite a bit but if you've gotten a chance to see such movies as The Game, Fight Club, or Panic Room and liked them I can almost guarantee you that you will be a fan of this movie.  Its a movie that deserves more recognition than what it gets made by a director who gets hardly any recognition. If you've never heard of David Fincher please see his movies. Just look him up online and find out what he has made.  He has only made a total of four movies so far (five, if you include Alien 3 which he has pretty much disowned because of the studio not giving him enough freedom with it) but all four of the movies are awesome in their own way.",1046736000,2,1111,4.311004784688995

101400,5,0790729989,"Stunningly morbid, Fincher's ""Se7en"" is a morose and disturbing flick without senselessness.
The plot is rich and textured. On the basis of the seven deadly sins, a serial killer plays out each sin in detail. Murder is the method, gluttony, greed, lust, envy and so on are each the subject matter, and apparent societal depravity is the canvas. Two police officers, a rookie detective, and a seasoned veteran, are left to put the pieces together and to try and stop the massacres from unfolding.
A deeply disturbing, and downright frightening, movie, ""Se7en"" accomplishes the purpose of this genre in a surprising and intelligent way. Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are exceptionally cast in roles each of them excel in, while Kevin Spacey's portrayal is nothing short of chilling.
The movie manages to surround you in a sense of morbidness. The rich texture (from, I've heard, the use of an innovative lens that alters the general colour of the movie) elicits a frightening calm, and a certain pitch and level of anticipation that captures the intent of the movie.
If you like this genre, ""se7en"" is worth more than a cursory look. Highly recommended.",1044489600,,1155,4.958762886597938
101401,5,0790729989,"This movie breaks all the rules of horror and sets its own.  There are gruesome killings, but we never see them happen.  The victims are people we never meet, but get the gut feeling we wouldn't be to fond of.  The murderer (Spacey) is revealed and arrested long before the climatic finish, and the great finale spares a gore show in favor of pure suspence and psychological terror.
The movie follows a pair of detectives as they slowly but surely track the killer, who leaves a string of victims by the specific sin they had commited.  (The first victim is labled for gluttony, then greed, and so on.)  These city detectives are the rational cool headed Somerset (Freeman) and the cocky young Mills (Pitt).  Somerset is single and takes his job very seriously when others don't.  He relies on logic and research.  Mills has a lovely wife and lives in what appears to be a nice home, although it often shakes due to its location.  These simple differences help to portray the differences in these two characters who are fairly distant, though they work together the whole time.
The movie from here becomes completely psychological, and its antagonist portrays a very grim image of the world in the theological sense.  But the thrill and suspense lies in whether the detectives stop the killer before he finishes his cycle of Seven, not to mention the eerie surprise that awaits at the climax.
The setting is in New York, and most of the scenes are very gloomy and dark.  There's a lot of imagery to go along with the plot, so rather than pass off the more gruesome scenes as just that, pay close attention to everything.  There are clues in unexpected places as well as some interesting tidbits that relate back to the literature used for reference of the Seven Deadly Sins.  The music is well fitting and quite frankly really good, but don't bother getting the soundtrack.  The best and most important songs are for some reason, not on it.
If you want a good slasher film, don't look here.  If you want a real pychological thriller, then don't miss this.  From the acting to the theme, it's a real treat.",1039392000,2,2105,4.633423180592992

101403,4,0790729989,"Okay, for those who liked Silence of the Lambs, this is a horror film for you. It's a mix between a murder mystery, crime drama, suspense film, and horror film. Yes this is a slasher film, this is a body count film. This is a slasher film with class. Director David Fincher doesn't want his audience to be comfortable for a moment while watching ""Seven."" Shaky camera shots, dark sets and a disturbing script that takes its characters to the extremes of emotion all contribute to the film creating a unsettled feeling that stays with you for a couple hours after the credits roll. The first time I watched this, I didn't like it, but that is because I wasn't really paying attention to it, and the sound and color on my t.v. wasn't working right. Anyway, the film begins with the overused premise of a young cop (Brad Pitt) being teamed for a murder investigation with an veteran on the verge of retirement. The two quickly develop a tense disrespect for each other, Pitt being the cocky smartass type and Freeman the hardened, pessimist New Yorker who has seen it all. Their investigation of a bizarre murder, in which an obese man is forced to eat himself to death, turns into a hunt for a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins -- gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and wrath as his calling card. The second victim, a rich lawyer, is the not-so-subtle tip off ""greed"" is written in blood on his carpet. What gives ""Se7en"" it's unsettling impact is the way the film connects deeply with each character, even the victims who are never seen alive. Freeman, Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife are all in top form here and the audience comes to know them intimately whatever affects them, affects the viewer equally. This is especially true of Pitt, whose character struggles to maintain his optimism in the face of the horrors he sees. The killer is played, by a well-known actor who is not named in the opening credits (the producers want to keep his identity a surprize), with a calm but explosive demeanor conspicuously reminiscent of ""Silence of the Lambs."" The tension is so well played that even though the unsatisfying conclusion becomes obvious a good 15 minutes before the climax, it doesn't diminish at all. Because of the way it assaults the emotions, seeing ""Se7en"" should not be taken lightly, and must be taken seriously to fully appreciate the film. This film has good acting, excellent script and a chilling soundtrack. I recommend buying or renting this film today, and watch it alone in the dark.",1037404800,,2531,4.689887640449438
101404,5,0790729989,"Se7en is ultimately the antithesis of what a Hollywood movie should be. When it came out, there was so much controversy about the film's brutal nature and horrifying ending. People in theaters walked out angry and disgusted. But maybe that's what makes it so brilliant. The fact that it makes you feel almost as wrought with emotion as Brad Pitt's character in the end is what makes it such a powerful film. The story revolves around two detectives: A bitter, seasoned veteran named Somerset (played by the wonderful Morgan Freeman) on the verge of retirement, and his replacement in training, the cocky Mills (played by Brad Pitt). Both are investigating a series of murders that appear to be based on the seven deadly sins (Greed, Envy, Pride, Wrath, Sloth, Gluttony and Lust) that are being committed by an anonymous ""John Doe"" (Later revealed as Kevin Spacey). No fingerprints can be found and virtually no clues are given. Both cops are consistently getting stressed out as the movie progresses, and the first two thirds of the movie focus on their relationship. Things, however, get really nasty in the final half hour, when John Doe unexpectedly turns himself in, and refuses to confess unless Somerset and Mills escort him to the site of his final two murders. I will not ruin the ending for you. Although, one might be able to predict to a certain degree what will happen after hearing a certain revealing conversation between Mills' wife and Somerset (However, what I predicted was actually more brutal than what happened, and probably couldn't be printed in these pages). This movie is basically David Fincher's break-through film. After critical shame with his contribution to the Alien series, Alien3, he redeemed himself with this masterpiece. The world Fincher creates in this movie is completely composed of filth. It is drenched in darkness and rains, and nobody ever seems to smile. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt do extremelely good jobs, but Gwenyth Paltrow's role as Mills' wife seems too under-developed. But I must say, if I had a hat on right now, it would go off to Kevin Spacey, who plays John Doe perfectly. His character is both cold and intelligent and Spacey does a fantastic job with such little screen-time. The DVD is, also, very excellent. There are four different commentary tracks, deleted scenes, two alternate endings and even a little feature on John Doe's notebooks. You really get the bulk for your buck on this one. I urge any movie fan who takes him/herself seriously to check this movie out. It is probably one of the top five movies on my favorites list.

101405,5,0790729989,"i'd like to think of seven as one of the films that redefined the horror/thriller genre. it is not made in the tradition of mindless slasher movies preceeding it, but it was made with an attention to detail that made it a head above most thrillers. it is unapologetically bleak, with incessant rain and gloomy atmosphere which is i think the perfect background to the subject on hand. heck, it is about a grisly serial killer, right? what did you expect, alice in wonderland?
i was 14 when i saw this movie - my brother brought my sister and i to see it on the big screen - and boy, did it blew my mind! it had never occured to me that such a great movie could be made. at that time, i had *no* idea of who fincher was nor was i aware of his previous efforts; so basically, i went to see the movie with an open mind, never expecting more than just a glimpse of brad pitt - who i adored at that time, and still now. and all i knew was that morgan freeman was a veteran actor who had left a positive impression the precious few times that i had seen his movies - and that was it.
so i was really in for a surprise. freeman was the perfect choice for the role of detective somerset, a man who looks ready to retire that very second if he had the chance and pitt as detective mills was his perfect foil - a man so eager to jump into the job on hand he seemed belligerent at times. the plot was also amazing; seven murders - all based on the seven deadly sins - that took place in a week (i think) and they have no clue as to whom the next victim will be. the killer, john doe - a superb spacey - is absolutely chilling as he taunts and leads the detectives in a merry chase.
the media made a lot of noice when this movie first came out, you know the usual stuff about how mvies like this glorifies violence... i beg to differ. a lot of times, the entertainment industry is just reflecting back what is happening in the real world - nothing more, nothing less.. just ask the cops.
so if you are squeasy, you know that you don't have to watch this movie. but other than that, this is a great movie that a lot of people can appreciate - because it is a mirror to the real world. a great movie with a great cast - i can't ask for more.

Now I can see why this downbeat (let's face it, depressing) film could inspire that kind of reaction in people but for me it did what a horror film should.
Now this is definitly a horror film, not your usual detective/killer movie.  The strength of the film is in the atmospherics created by the incredible production design and cinematography.  On top of this is the way in which Fincher handles every scene with attention drawn to every bleak detail.  It carried me through the range of emotions from sadness through fear and, yes, revulsion but overall it entertained me.  Every-so-often I like to see a film like this, something which challenges me and Fincher's work is a masterpiece of the serial-killer/horror genre.
Those looking for a redemptive ending should maybe view Michael Mann's excellent 'Manhunter' (one of my favourite films of all-time and one which would recieve 5stars).

I hate Kevin Spacey.  He just has that lispy voice and blank stare as he does in every movie.  There are Sesame Street characters that are more menacing than this.  (Snuffalufagus and the Grouch are 2 examples. Heck, Burt and Ernie are as well. Ok, Elmo and the rest are as well!)

101432,5,0790729989,"It really, truly is.  There are very few movies that present this aura of hopelessness without making it too over-the-top or corny.  Road To Perdition (the best film I have seen so far this year) is a movie that succeeds at this, and is one of the few that has done it since Seven.
Instead of beating around the bush, Seven gets right into it, and introduces you to two very well-developed characters that are as different from each other as God and Satan.  One is the cocky, overconfident David Mills, not so much a rookie, but definitly too young to know what he is doing (Brad Pitt in, I believe, the best performance of his career.)  The other is soft-spoken, intelligent, by-the-book veteran William Sommerset, a man that has seen the ropes and knows which ones not to try and balance on.  With a 400+ pound man tortured beyond anything either of them has ever witnessed, the detectives are off on the trail of a killer that is elusive, intelligent, ruthless, and, as Sommerset calls his worse characteristic ""patient.""  The reason that this movie had such an impact with Hollywood and the general theater going public is the reason that a killer with such motives was never introduced with quite the level of ferocity.  Certainly, we all have heard of Ed Gein and Jack The Ripper, both supposedly assassins of sin, but never has a character of such magnitude and with so many dimensions like John Doe been introduced.  Even though Kevin Spacey's role was short lived, he deserved an Academy Award nomination for his performance.  It was chilling to the point of hating it when it looked like he was looking at you.
By the end, you are not only shocked, you are drained.  When it seems that every horrible thing has happened, it just keeps getting worse.  You seriously feel like you have been dried out and need water.  This shows the movie's brilliance.  You are drawn into the lives of characters that seem simplistic, but are developed on a very realistic level, especially Mills.  The acting was excellent, the direction and set design are worthy of applause, and the script was written with power, a rarity in today's cinematic vision.  You feel like these characters are people you know, and you feel for them.  You laugh with them, and you certainly gasp and cry with them.  This movie is one of the most amazing films ever to be produced in the last twenty years of film.  David Fincher has, for the most part (with the exclusion of Alien 3 and Panic Room which both were big wastes of time) to be one of the most underappreciated and brilliant directors ever to come along.  Brad Pitt is not just some pretty boy looking for the fast buck.  The man knows how to act and does it very well.  Morgan Freeman is impossible not to like in any role he is in and Gwyneth Paltrow's softness and beauty just make for the perfect touch to contrast with Kevin Spacey's sinister soul.  This movie will always be remembered and is going to be a classic.

101434,5,0790729989,"One has only to look at the one-star reviews to see the impact Se7en has... the reviews don't trash the movie, rather they attempt to grapple with just how strong the psychological impact of the film (not so much a visceral horror film as only one murder is actually shown on-screen, Se7en derives much of its power from look and feel of the film... which is oppressive to say the least) had on them at the time of viewing.  Obviously, it's a film that sticks with you long after the credits have crawled across the screen.  With more decay than a David Lynch film, Se7en has a hopeless, downward spiral feel to it... much has been made of the ""inevitable"" ending for instance, but it's apparent from the opening credit sequence (a true stunner... and a film unto itself, complete with a twisted version of Nine Inch Nail's ""Closer (to God)"" played over the visuals like the chimes from Satan's ice cream truck) right to the end sequence in startling sunlight that David Fincher intended the film to be bereft of even the faintest glimmer of hope... and for that he ought to be commended, for though it may seem easy to do, it really is difficult to make an unsympathetic film viewable after more than one time (case in point: the equally disturbing, highly visceral, and nearly unwatchable ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer... which is actually compelling enough to ensure one sit-through, but unfriendly enough to avoid repeated viewings).  The DVD is excellent beyond measure (unless you set the bar for extras and DVD quality at the Criterion ""Brazil"" set... then it's only pretty damn good).  The extras are worthy enough to sit through a few times, and the look of the DVD version of the movie is excellent, as is the sound.  Although popular and pop enough to share the shelf with crap like ""Armageddon,"" Se7en is also at home on the same shelf as any Lynch, Gilliam or Greenaway film... it's that good -- narratively, stylistically, and aesthetically an amazing film.

It has a very good story and great acting by all the actors. People don't give movies like this the respect it deserves! This is also another movie that you can watch over and over again and it doesn't get boring. David Fincher is a great Director and this movie is really his first really good movie. I recommened this movie to any fans of great movies. The DVD is also very good with plenty of extras, perfect sound (DTS) and excellent sound!

101436,5,0790729989,"Is it not amazing that even when you know the narrative and plot inside out you can  watch a film again and again. That's why we fans collect films I suppose. Se7en is the best thriller i have ever seen and is ever likely to be.  I saw it first uncut at the cinema and then many times both on TV and DVD. ... the poor customer was forced at gunpoint to have sex with the prostitute and he was made to wear a ghastly contraption that was like a terrible dagger - I leave the rest to your imagination.  The  camera shots of the photos shown of this crime scene were so quick that you need to be very observant to catch the drift. That's why the poor guy was in such a state of shock.
Terrific story line and I truly believe one of the most shocking and unexpected endings that i have ever seen. How well John Doe's manipulation of the character of David Mills  fulfilled the only ending possible.  I enjoyed the way Sommerset was researching the work of Dante in order to try to solve the crime. I sat in the cinema quite numb, barely believing how cleverly David Fincher had led me in a direction that I was not expecting and was annoyed with myself that I did not see it coming. ... Very brave of the director to take that route and that's why he is so good. We need more films like this to kepe alive the great thrill of movie viewing.  ...
I don't think that you can fault this film.  For its genre it surpasses everything. Freeman and Pitt together were foils to one another and no I don't think that Paltrow needed a more developed role, her part in the movie was just right.
...often talking about violent acts has more impact than showing them, and this is why Se7en is so effective.

101437,1,0790729989,"For the entirety of this movie, the viewer is pulled down into the bleakest depths, dragged through the darkest corners of a most pitiless, murderous mind, and there -- as the closing credits roll -- we are left. Which is the most unworthy thing a filmmaker can do. I was genuinely outraged by ""Seven"", not because of its sadistic violence, but because it could find no cause to transform that violence into some kind of redeeming moment. In ""Seven"", the filmmakers do the easiest thing possible: create a fiendish murderer who kills in the most gruesome ways imaginable. That's EASY. A truly good film would have taken that premise and done something creative with it; fashioned a story that would have released the audience from its unrelentingly bleak grip with an ennobling insight, event, word, moment ... anything. As it is, this movie only seems intent on sucking the viewer as far as possible into the abyss. There's nothing remarkable about an achievement like that. In ""Poetics,"" Aristotle discusses ""catharsis"" in Greek tragedy as something owed the audience by the playwright. A drama may steep an audience in cruel travail, but to be truly successful as art, the work must purge those intense audience emotions -- bring ""catharsis"" to the events of the drama. There is no catharsis in this movie. The only reaction left to us is anger for being so manipulated by the filmmakers.
And it is a shame, because I thought  at one point this movie had the potential for greatness (the cinematography is magnificent), difficult as it was watching and as contrived as the plotline is. Because, of course, I expected a worthy director, a worthy writer, would finally take this dark vision and transform it into light, even if just a small hint of light. That doesn't happen. As viewers, we have been exploited ... and [taken advantage of]. This isn't art. This isn't good movie making. This is profiting in meanness.",1022630400,29,1919,4.868501529051988

Although Brad Pitt's ""method acting"" in his first scene of the movie was somewhat - not cool.

101454,4,0790729989,"the commentary with david fincher, brad pitt, and morgan freeman is probably the most rambling commentary i've ever heard on a DVD.  it's a little tragic the way fincher fawns all over pitt like a high skool new media dork with a secret crush on the quarterback.  pitt himself uses big words and concepts a little incoherently - but i'm sure he looks great while he does it.  freeman just seems to think it's ""inside the actor's studio with morgan freeman,"" because he constantly goes off on these half-hour lectures over the fine points of screen-versus-stage acting or whatever, usually in the middle of my favorite scenes when i really wish they would talk about what's actually going on.
still, it's a nice movie, very stylish, very consciously film noir in the classic detective sense, though it thoroughly explored the boundaries of the R-rating in 1995.  fincher knows what he's doing in creating an atmosphere of decayed, malevolent beauty, as anybody who's seen any of his films or videos knows.  it's very gothic and not believable at all if you take any time to think about it - the murder scenes are especially over-the-top, ""cute,"" contrived and storyboarded, even considering that john doe is a 90's kind of lunatic with a strong sense of irony.  but for what it's worth, i like that theatricality.  give me the ludicrous and beautifully revolting eye-candy of se7en anyday over the ""hyperreal"" shaky grainy camcorder of...well, you know.
as for the actors, morgan freeman is typically understated and believable, but his character is really just the straight man to brad pitt's overblown drama-queen tough-guy, whose histrionics suggest an attempt to channel brando.  gwyneth paltrow is as good as anybody in the rather one-dimensional role of ""the wife."" she doesn't do anything in the movie really except hang out in the apartment; her character is critical to the plot simply by virtue of who she is to pitt.  of course, kevin spacey pulls off the role of john doe the serial killer with both hands cuffed behind his back.  he's pretty much what you were expecting: shaved head; manifest ""schizophrenic"" behavior patterns; creepy, deliberate diction; and that strange combination of prissy righteousness and pathological malevolence that has been movie shorthand for ""homicidal nut"" at least since silence of the lambs.
everything is a little bit ""too much"" in this film; the moral is, that's entertainment.  but the ""surprise"" ending actually is the most logical way to go with this storyline.  fincher just had the balls to go there and stay there and not condescend to the audience's supposed sentimentaility.  i haven't watched the alternate ending(s) but if they mess with the basic theme in any way, i'm sure they're horrible.  if you're going to make this kind of movie, i.e. the grim commentary on the sickness of modern society from the point-of-view of one of its sickest, you don't weasel your way out of it at the end just to pander to a demo.
one last interesting point is that this film is not yet a decade old, yet it's already been pirated conceptually on so many levels that it really does lack the power today that it had when it came out.  the obvious case-in-point is the title sequence, which was groundbreaking in its day, as hard as that is to believe.  now (as brad pitt observes) you've seen the same technique in every trifling car ad on TV, every music video, every sitcom intro, etc.  all successful films are copycatted, but they really went nuts with se7en.  still, there's enough substance under the style to redeem a watch - even though it may already seem slightly old skool!",1022112000,,3626,4.868292682926829

Also, the seven deadly sins idea was incredible as well. Never have I seen a more impressive film, spare Fight Club (another one by Fincher, surprise surprise).

The excellent characters, script, music, and atmosphere all work together to create the perfect canvas to paint this brutal tale of a serial killer that tortures and kills specific people in accordance with the seven deadly sins. Everything in Se7en has been tweaked to perfection. The movie captures your attention so completely that you can't look away, even at some of the truly morbid scenes. And let's not forget the acting! Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey are all simply outstanding. Every word they utter seems real, unlike most Hollywood films where the characters are contrived and simply not believeable. The ending is shocking and depressing, more than equaling the rest of the film.

101461,4,0790729989,"This movie is definitely fun to watch, and is a visual experience. The director did a superb job envisioning the carnage left by a very, very disturbed man.
The movie's main characters are cops played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, the former being a grizzled pro on the verge or retirement, the latter being a young detective recently transferred to homicide. Both roles are played well. But the fun of the movie lies in the gory scenes, which are well-designed and original, and following the cops from one scene to the next, just a little too late, a tad too slow to stop the criminal.
The movie is punctuated by a short, but sweet, performance by Kevin Spacey and an ending with definite punch.

101462,4,0790729989,"I stop short of five stars for two reasons.  A.) Kevin Spacey, the psycho around which the film revolves, has only a few minutes of screen time.  B.) We don't get to see enough of Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt together onscreen to understand the dynamics of their relationship.  Brad Pitt's dialogue could have been better as well...some lines were just awkward.
That being said, the film is deliciously gruesome, cruel, and dark.  It presents both the ugliest sides of New York and humankind and makes no apologies for making your stomach turn.  The premise is brilliant as well...I've seen plenty of 'whodunnits' but nobody has ever thought of weaving in the seven deadly sins (hence the name, Seven).  It was brilliant, and the murders themselves were very creative indeed.
This edition of the DVD is the best one.  It's a two-disc set containing storyboards, director's commentary, and much more.

101474,5,0790729989,"I don't like Seven.  All who recommend it say it's a good film and that it is well made.  But did they like it?  Oh, no.  This is not a remake of Frank Capra's ""It's a wonderful Life"" but a film that is designed to depress.  The first time you see it is the worst.  You are subjected to events of nastiness that go far beyond gritty realism and just as you begin to hope there will be something resembling a happy ending it delivers the ultimate slap in the face.  This film is about sin, about how it corrupts the world around us and about how inescapable it is.
Brad Pitt has never been better and is well suited to character of Mills.  Morgan Freeman is great as always and Kevin Spacey also makes a brief but memorable appearance.  It is a film that also has a unique visual quality to it but it is the sound that really makes the atmosphere.  Using the sound to generate an atmosphere is a shrewd move because many won't notice it unless it's pointed out.  Barking dogs, car sirens, continual rain, there is no peace in this film and at times the ambient sounds drown out the dialogue.  (It's okay; the DVD has subtitles).  Compare Seven with most other films and you'll notice that sound is rarely used in such an artistic way.
The DVD itself is very nice indeed.  The first disk has the film itself and four commentaries.  Everyone featured on the commentaries is honest about their experiences and when listening to them you begin to learn all kinds of things about the person speaking and the movie process.  David Fincher's contributions are the real price for me as Alien3 is one of favourite films and I found out a great deal more about him.  On the first commentary you'll find out more about Brad Pitt here than a years subscription to any gossip magazine.  Perhaps maybe two.  Morgan Freeman is also a pleasure to listen too.  It is remarkable to learn about what makes these people tick and what makes them laugh.  The commentaries also feature Richard Dyer; author of the BFI critique of Seven, and most of the material featured in the book is in the various commentaries.  Of course, four commentaries means you have to watch the film four times over.  A summary documentary would have been nice.
The second disc disappoints.  There isn't a great deal of material on it, only a few detailed scenes and other stuff.

101480,4,0790729989,"'Se7en' returns the crime thriller to Edgar Allen Poe, inventor of the detective story.  In his tales featuring the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, Poe dubbed the criminal and the detective, the 'creative' and the 'resolvant' - the criminal creates a crime like a work of art; the detective analyses and interprets it like a critic.  In 'Se7en', John Doe's serial killing has an aesthetical form - not only does he pattern it according to an overarching structure; not only does the method of each crime connect thematically to its sin; but each is an elaborate, meticulously-staged tableau which the detectives must read before they can understand it and proceed.  The thrller hinges on whether the detectives are good critics - William Somerset, who deals in dedicated scholarship, absorbing the primary texts, is; the younger Mills, who skimps with 'Cliff's Notes', isn't.
A second model in 'Se7en' is Dante's 'Divine Comedy', which screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker reverses.  Somerset is Virgil, the teacher full of cultural and ethical knowledge who should bring his student, Mills as Dante, to progressive understanding and enlightenment.  Rather than moving heavenwards, however, 'Se7en' is a slow ride to Hell, beginning with the Purgatorial Sin nearest to Heaven, Gluttony, and working down through the rest.  The ultimate goal facing the student is not achieving redemption but avoiding damnation.  Although New York might seem like a living hell - a medieval inferno plagued by random violence, apathy, noise, decay, rain, lonely rotting lives - it is really a Purgatorial testing-ground; but Somerset is a bad teacher, Mills an inattentive student.
Then there is Borges, who, in stories such as 'Death and the Compass', used the detective format and the 'clues' to be read in Great Literature, to destroy the ethical assumptions of forms and identity.
'Se7en' is the kind of film that only seems a masterpiece on first viewing, when shock, suspense and novelty replace our critical faculties.  As such, its effect is immediate and gut-wrenching, as the film flatters our intellect without making any demands on it.  But as would become apparent in his later films, director Fincher always pulls back from being truly radical, and what seems to be a hopeless, dank, inexorable, anti-Hollywood apocalyptic vision is actually as reassuring as the most conservative detective novel: unlike Borges, it retains a faith in patterns, taking them to their logical conclusions, giving some sort of meaning, no matter how bleak to chaos.  Despite Somerset's protests, Doe is too reassuringly, articulately psychotic to suggest a projection of inner evil, remorse or Biblical vengeance (indeed, the film might be a moral story about man's hubris in replacing God).  The script contrivances (as in imaginative short-cuts, rather than failures in plausibility) become increasingly apparent.
The best directors - from Hitchcock to Ray to Soderbergh - are also Critics, interrogating the scripts they film, but Fincher seems content to reproduce Walker's pretentious gloom and thematic timidity - even the grungiest scenes are filmed with exquisite symmetry and loving detail.  The script itself queasily reproduces Doe's moral censoriousness, punishing in kind a woman who simply contemplated abortion.  The film is full of beautiful compositions (the brutally ironic torchlights in the opening investigation; the neon blue as they check out the 'Help Me' fingerprints); exciting set-pieces (the first chase of Doe; the wracking final 20 minutes); and gruesome moments (the jerk of a flayed victim).  The acting is terrific, especially Brad Pitt in his first great performance, using his good-looking cockiness to devastating effect, in many ways more complex and sympathetic than Morgan Freeman's earnest elder cop, with his intriguingly failed past and sterile present.  As a whole, however, I don't think 'Se7en' holds up.",1010448000,4,3918,5.389525368248773

Seven is Fincher's second movie!  His first being an underrated Alien 3.  In his second effort, Fincher crafted, what I think, to be the best suspense/thriller in thirty-years.  Unique.  Gut churning.  Awesomely acted.  Every shot compliments the next.  Every shot is perfect.  The sound track was perfectly thought out.  Like Hitchcock... the script was well-fleshed out, everything was perfect BEFORE HAND, and everything was perfect afterward.
In a sess-pool of cookie-cutter ""yes"" men that are succeeding in the movie business, Fincher emerged and did it his way.  Thankfully, he continues to do it his way.  Following ""Seven"", he continued to do masterful work with well-written movies like ""The Game"" and ""Fight Club"".  ""The Panic Room"" is coming out soon and I can't wait.
It isn't quantity that counts... it's quality.  Fincher takes his time and makes sure it's done RIGHT.

101483,5,0790729989,"Se7en is, in my opinion, the best directed film ever.  Perhaps had the subject matter been less grisly, multiple awards would've been won.  ...
The gruesome story about a serial killer who murders by the seven deadly sins is an incredibly smart film that no doubt was intensely researched.  Andrew Kevin Walker's script is rife with great dialog, interesting twists, and very well researched pathology and literatue references.
David Fincher had a highly successful music video career before this, but this film truly showed his brilliance.  Everything is dark and haunting.  The camerawork fits the situation perfectly, from the steady flowing shots in the calm before the storm to the highspeed handhelds in the chases and intense sequences.  He is a master of his surroundings and the direction is a terrific showcase of the dark territory this film moves into.
The performances are equally impressive.  Morgan Freeman turns in his usual great job, but Brad Pitt is truly an awesome force.  At first I thought that a lot of his acting in certain scenes was slightly cheesy, but in subsequent viewings it's easy to see where every bit of acting came from.  This is his show all the way.  Gwyneth Paltrow is warm and gives the right amount of emotion that is needed to counteract the gruesome parts of the movie.  Having truly earned his reputation for playing psychos through this film, Kevin Spacey is menacing in a very intellectual way, and it is perfect for the role.  He's smart and calculating, but you can see that's his character is just a powder keg waiting to explode.
Overall this is an incredible film.  It has great direction, acting writing, and especially production design.  The film is haunting and dark.

101495,5,0790729989,"I think we can all agree that the first version of ""Seven"" that came out on DVD was a little more than disappointing.  The picture quality and sound could've been a whole lot better.  There could've been more extras, which the first DVD totally lacked.  Most of all, the movie was on BOTH sides of the DVD, which meant that you had to change sides halfway through the movie.  Well, all of that has changed, because now you can own ""Seven"" in a new restored and loaded with extras special edition.
First, let's talk about the DVD.  The picture quality is outstanding and is a lot more clearer than the earlier version.  The sound has also improved greatly, (especially since you can choose DTS if you have it), and makes the movie seem more darker and twisted than before.  There are so many extras on it that it's not even funny.  There's little documentaries on making part of the movie, (like how the notebooks found in John Doe's apartment were created).  This special edition is two disks, which means there are more than enough special features that will keep you happy.
Now, let's talk about the movie.  Let's face it; you're not going to spend a lot of money on a DVD that you do not like just because it's loaded with extras.  Why would you want a horrible movie with great extras?  Well, this is a suspenseful and dark thriller that will stay with you even after it's all said and done.  Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play detectives who are hunting down a maniac serial killer who kills people by their sins.  Each murder is more puzzling, gruesome, and bizarre than the last.  They must find out who the killer is before he finishes his so-called ""masterpiece.""  How much blood must be shed before the killer is caught?  This is an unforgettable movie that will haunt you in your dreams.
This is a spectacular collection that really does the movie justice.  I must warn you that you might want to rent this one first before buying it.  It is a very disturbing and gruesome movie with very graphic and explicit crime scenes.  This movie is not for people with weak stomachs.  If you love the movie, then by all means, purchase this explosive DVD.  It'll leave you breathless.",1006041600,4,2184,4.546153846153846
101496,5,0790729989,"""Seven"" is one of the most intelligent, thought provoking movies of the 90's. I would not, however, characterize it as ""realism"", but rather as morbid surrealism, in the sense that the director is less concerned with getting the details of the real world right and more concerned with painting a picture of a doomed, dark, and basically evil world. This is the only performance Brad Pitt has ever given that I can stomach, and I would even go so far as to say that he does very well as the well intelligent but none too bright young detective, Mills. Morgan Freeman gives a flawless performance as Somerset, a misanthropic intellectual who is beginning to question both his occupation and the basic goodness and desirability of human life. Fincher is obviously trying to tell us something very unpleasant with this film, and yet his message is relevant and not simply intended to depress or disgust. The evil in the world is crushing when we stop ignoring it and is quite irreparable, there is no way to take back one act of malice or one atrocity, and therefore we cannot see the world as necessarily 'good'. Although he goes a little overboard with the rain and sometimes lapses into pretentiousness, most of it is subtle, masterfully done, darkly humorous at times, and chillingly believable. If you think you can't take the unrelentingly bleak atmosphere of it, wait until you see the ending, which is undoubtedly one of the most disturbing and horrific finales I've ever seen in a motion picture. This is not just a 'shocker' or an 'MTV movie', and is probably one of the best movies of the 90's.

Directed by the amazing David Fincher, ""Se7en"" choregraphs its way through a rainy, murky city filled with a rate of crime comparable to any large city.  However, attracting the attention of Detective Mills (an amazing Brad Pitt) and just-about-to-retire Detective Somerset (always good Morgan Freeman) is a murderer who kills his victims based upon the seven deadly sins.
Incredible in its art directing, fast-paced in its action and disturbing in its ability to disgust you, ""Se7en"" reaches into the dark holes that we want to crawl down but don't have the nerve to.  Filled with surprising guest appearances and scenes that are all too remembered -- the protrayal of ""Sloth"" is utterly chilling -- it gives that attention that ""Silence of the Lambs"" sends.",1004400000,,1035,5.260606060606061

Very creative and Very suspenful.
The best climax and ending in the whole history of movies.
Not for the faint hearted because of the aftermaths of the killings.
Shockingly powerful and moving
Great acting, script and directing.
Dark but very effectively set.
The most frightning and creative killer in movie history.
For those who have strong stomachs and love suspense along with
great acting, script, story and directing. This is your movie.
Alot of people I know who hate suspense and who are afraid of lots of gore loved this.
(some people may disagree with me but)i think it's a crowed pleaser, But you may still find some scenes to graphic.
It is the best film ever made in my books and I cant recommend this movie enough to you because its just so magnificent.

101502,4,0790729989,"Seven is the serial killer movie that lingers over every other attempt made since Seven.  This is not so much for the story, which a little too clever and gets a little too shocky for it's own good, this movie created the most oppressive, despair filled world seen in the movies for quite sometime.  Where Blade Runner had pollution and huge overbearing buildings in the future, Seven finds darkness and sickening inner sanctums in the present world.  It's amazing what director David Fincher does with something as simple as an apartment to make it a frankly, disgusting environment.  Morgan Freeman is the lynchpin that holds this whole world together, without him this movie would have failed.  He is the character that the audience can empathize with, and watch with him as the world falls apart around him.  I watch this movie in amazement at just how depressing it is, and how much atmosphere and dread is fit into a 2 hour running time.  Now onto the DVD.  As with all Fincher special editions, it is great.  4 Commentaries, numerous deleted scenes, alternate endings, trailers, behind the scenes, and on and on.  It's overwhelming at first, but there isn't anything about this movie that isn't touched in the dvd.  I love Finchers commentaries, he genuinely seems interested in telling his audience how and why he picked certain set-ups, and how he got the movie made and all of those juicy tidbits you and I have grown to love.  I have grown tired of directors seeming bored and detached as they spout on and on, about the actors and how great they were, and really not saying a whole lot.  Fincher is different, and I appreciate his willingness to do the kind of in-depth stuff he does, because it really does get people to appreciate the movie a lot more.  I have gone way off track.  As you can see, I love this dvd.  The movie has it's flaws, they aren't numerous but they're there.

Revolving around the seven deadly sins John Doe [the killer] pins each sin against the sinner forcing them to die by the dreadful sin that they live. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are absolutley great as the detectives, almost complete opposites yet fulfilling eachothers gaps, Freeman as the brains, and Pitt as the eager self centered young one. Kevin Spacey was stand Outish, pulling a great performance as always, and Gweneth Paltrow as the great and loving wife. Directed by David Fincher who also did Fight Club with Brad Pitt, holding the best chase scene I have ever seen in a movie, gripping suspense [especially the end] and spine tingling thrills and a great shot of the killer through the reflection of the puddle coming towards Pitt, the end is very suspensful every time I see it, it doesnt get old, leaving you with a memory you'll never forget, ""The Lord Works in Mysterious Ways"" so says Doe who believes himself to be doing God's good work.

This is the case with David Fincher's ""Seven,"" a superb film that transcends the fact that it's merely about two cops tracking a serial killer. The performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are flawless, not to mention a superb cameo (by an actor who'll remain nameless for the benefit of those of you who still haven't seen it) as the psychotic ""John Doe"".
Working with an intelligent script by Andrew Kevin Walker (who also punched up some of the dialouge for ""Fight Club"", Director David Fincher gives us an intelligent thriller that remains relentless and uncompromising.

Example:the commentary reveals the studio wanted to make the film with a less distrubing, more hackneyed ending, but Fincher, Pitt and Freeman would only do the ""head in the box"" version.

Morgan Freeman again shows his ability to add true intelligence, wisdom, and feeling to a character, and fits in well with Pitt's ability to create a strong personality.
The connection to Mideval poetry and literature is also an excellent medium for Morgan Freeman's character to dwell in.  It gives depth to the murderer's personality without ever having to see a scene with Kevin Spacy in it.

First the extras: There are so many extras they had to unload them on a separate disc! There's all kinds of things in it like deleted scenes that added background on Morgan Freeman's character. It's pretty cool to watch if you want to get a deeper look in to Detective Somerset. There's a whole lot of other cool things to watch that explain the film making porcess, like what was going through Fincher's mind when he did the things he did. The audio comentary is fun. It's Brad Pitt and David fincher watching the movie with some phone in coments by Morgan Freeman that are enlightening. Overall the Extras are stacked.
The sound to the movie was completely remixed for this movie. The surround sound is bad as all get out, so if there's any audio fans out there, you'll get your fix. The picture is awesome too. It's nice and clear and the blacks are very rich which is aesthetically pleasing to me.
The movie itself is a mater peice of cinema. THe story revolves around a cop who transfers himself to a bad city to work homocide. That's Brad Pitt. His character will be taking over Morgan Freeman's place in the department becasue he'll be retiring soon. They work together on this case that envolves a killer who kills using the 7 deadly sins.

101538,5,0790729989,"I truly loved, strike that, really liked this flick. To love this movie is perhaps an obsession saved for the pages of a Stephen King novel or a sign that I need help. This movie is very, very violent both overtly and passively. You are left with a sense that New York is nothing but a cesspool. While many non-New Yorkers might agree, I think its gritty cinematography and dialogue, really work to amplify the murderer's personality. Not only is he deadly insane, but also he is the deadliest in a world filled with violence.
In addition, I think the movie has an originality that makes you smack your forehead and wonder why you hadn't written it first. It is the perfect tale where we all already understand the symbols and the motivations, but they are turned on their head. It was as if Hieronymus Bosch was the writer and we are looking at the modern day incarnation of the last panel of the Garden of Earthly Delights. In essence, the grotesque is used to shock, but also to teach us. The lesson could be religious or the fact great horrors have been committed under religion's banner. Or, which is most likely, that films are simply to make money.
This movie has great acting beyond its violent and disturbing story. It is so good I don't think there is a movie studio that could afford to ever reassemble the four key actors to make another movie-Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, & Gwenyth Paltrow. This power pack puts the story beyond other disturbing tales like Kubrick's Clockwork Orange into a lasting package that, had it been a more tame topic, would be a standard on television for years. This movie belongs only a notch bellow the pinnacle of serial killer movies, Silence of the Lambs, and light years beyond such utterly awful attempts like Hannibal & Copy Cats.

The problem?  The ending.  It doesn't make sense.  The first five deaths are supposedly because of the victims' own vices.  The last two are because of someone else's vices.  That alone makes the ending a disappointment - it seems that it was more for shock value than substance.  Which is really too bad considering the great substantiative dialogue and interaction that occurs just previous to the finale.

The ending is so amazing that I did that. The rest of the movie is pretty great. This movie is odd though because the entire film is just building up to the ending and if you just saw the last scene the end would mean nothing.
The storys about and new cop to the NYPD(Brad Pitt) and a retiring cop(Morgan Freeman) As the story goes along they discover that a killer is going to kill 7 people based on the Seven deadly sins. It's a great plot. The acting seems out of place. Detective Somerset seems to be a guy of great wisdom, while Brad Pitt just seems to ...though the movie.
The Extras are pretty bland. They could have been onto one disc. The endings are pretty bland and the exact same. The rest is just boring. The movie is alone is worth the DVD and the extras are just kinda, there.

101562,5,0790729989,"The Se7en New Line Platinum Series edition is a high-water mark in the release of modern film classics, and puts some recent Criterion releases to shame.  This is a film that deserved a thoughtful release, and it got it.
Se7en is a film that works perfectly despite (or rather, because of) the formulaic set-up: rookie homicide detective Mills (Brad Pitt) is paired with a crusty old veteran, detective Sommerset (Morgan Freemen), who is in his last days before retirement.  This, of course, is exactly when a Brilliant Serial Killer With a Diabolical Plan decides to commit a series of ghastly murders.  Naturally, films in this genre need to have a ""hook"", a conceit that gives the murders a possibly predictable pattern.  This way our intrepid detectives can engage the killer in a battle of wits, a Race Against Time to save lives before the Master Plan is completed.  In this case, the title says it all - the serial killer is patterning his crimes after the seven deadly sins.
But here is where Se7en veers off course, and, in the process, becomes a real masterpiece of the genre. This familiar, well-worn surface is a deception. Se7en wants you to relax, thinking you know the territory, and then pull the proverbial rug out. I won't tell you what happens or who the serial killer turns out to be (just in case you are one of the few people on Earth who doesn't know by now), but even if you figure it all out beforehand, it won't do you any good.  You will still sweat.  You will still squirm.  You will still peek through your fingers - which is a shame, since the feature on DVD #1 was transferred from the original camera negative under the supervision of director David Fincher.  In the commentary track, Fincher himself says that this is probably the best that Se7en has ever looked.
When you uncover your eyes again, you can then get lost for many hours in the formidable collection of supplemental material on DVD #2.  Most fascinating is a detailed look at the creation of the prop journals featured in the serial killer's lair.  It is not often that we stop to consider that someone actually has to create the stuff we see on screen, and that they often labor for weeks to get something just right - only to have it handled for a few moments by an actor and then discarded.
In all, the Se7en New Line Platinum Series edition is a valuable addition to any serious film collection.",990835200,5,2396,4.587822014051523
101563,5,0790729989,"First of all, I have to say, what a movie!  This definitely is one movie to talk about.  This movie exploits the seven deadly sins at their extremes.  This picture has great acting as well as great storyline.  Brad Pitt and Morgan Freedman do an excellent job, not to mention the ""John Doe Killer,"" when he finally makes his appearance.  The musical score was well done and the video transfer and all the work that they put into this picture is shown beautifully.  As each of the scenes are done to crystal clarity, colors redone to the directors fitting, shots readjusted, you won't see a more stunning quality picture on other DVDs.  The sound effects, especially from the constant rainfall and natural surroundings will astound you.  Excellent use of the Dolby Digital EX and DTS ES systems.  The rain definitely must be mentioned, for it almost plays it's own role as a character.  Often times I found myself double taking and rewinding just to make sure that the sounds I heard were from the movie and not from real life.
The Supplemental DVD also has to be noted for it's upstanding part in this Platinum Series.  There is so much to this dvd that you'll spend a full weekend just trying to get through this all.  Commentary on how they redid and re-adjusted everything for this DVD was intriguing.
If you liked the movie or had interest in the movie, buy this DVD.  You will not be disappointed.  With a mind blowing plot and beatiful video transfer and musical score to accompany it, you can't go wrong.  Not to mention the extra Supplemental DVD.

101565,5,0790729989,"First off i love this movie, it's simply great, nuff said. Secondly the packaging for this DVD is also great, the notebook (DVD case) is really cool and inventive. The picture and sound quality of the DVD are also very impressive.
 So the only negative thing i can really say is that some of the extras on this DVD aren't really that great. Some of it is cool like the commentary by Fincher and the John Doe notebook. But the thing that really got to me was the so called ""alternate endings"". Now the only alternate ending they have on film is really not different than the original. It is simply a more rushed version that was made for screening audiences before the movie was actually released. Once the screening audiences responded well to the movie, the studio proceeded to fund a more polished up ending (w/ helicopter scenes, etc.)
 In my case this alternate ending was one of the main reasons i bought the DVD, and it ....wasnt what i expected.... and really let me down. After the initial disappointment i proceeded to watch the other alternate ending. Which was in storyboard form, and was radically different than the final ending that was used (although it was way cheesier and made no sense - listen to fincher's comments on it). Also, the 7 extra scenes aren't really that cool either. But i guess they weren't that bad.
 Overall i'm still giving this DVD 5 stars because i love the movie, and all the essentials of the DVD are great - like the picture / sound quality & the packaging. The extras are just that; extra. They're nice to look at, but in this case you'll probably only watch them once or twice. But they don't take anything away from the overall package that you get, which is a great movie and DVD with SOME cool extras.",988934400,8,1748,4.507886435331231

But to this day there hasn't been anything in comparison to Fight Club in terms of price range that just offers that much.

Most people forget a couple, but after seeing this movie I do not think I will ever forget any one of them.  The movie is powerful and well-acted by Morgan Freeman, and (surprisingly) Brad Pitt.  The premise alone is ingenious, maybe, even the best concept for a thriller in a long time.  I have a feeling the screenwriter, Kevin Walker, will be a high commodity for a long time.
What is the premise? Well, it's about an extreme righteous killer named Jon Doe (played by the ever talented Kevin Spacey) being tracked down by two detectives, the soon-to-be-retired Somersett (freeman), and the new kid, Sims (Pitt).  Although we never see the deaths take place, we do see the aftermath which is very unsettling and let's your mind wander on how it all took place, the torture Jon Doe put them through.  When Jon Doe is told that he is killing innocent people he responds, ""innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?"" then says why those people deserved there death sentence, each linked to one of the deadly sins, of course.  Then when you think the movie is unsettling enough, the ending will push you over the edge.  GRADE: A",988070400,,1209,4.590697674418605

That his character is erudite is reason enough to rent this movie, regardless of whether or not you like thriller-type flicks.
Brad Pitt is excellent as Freeman's ignoramous partner, David Mills.  The plot has the two of them attempting to apprehend a felon who is every bit as learned as  detective Somerset.  Due to this, the movie is able to do what few other movies have ever done;  it delves into the morose Dantesque overtones of sin and punishment.

(If you have not heard of the Criterion Collection, please search for titles that include this designation - you will not be disapointed!)  Seven is a great film with superb writing, acting, direction, the whole shebang and I am not going to bore you with those details.  This review centers entirely on the Platinum DVD Release - and I can honestly say that it is VERY worth the money you spend on it.

Beyond this, the professionals who work behind the scenes have their two cents to share with you as well, and they are quite informative.  Exlporing the Title Sequence is invigorating, as are the animated story boards.  But the true value of this DVD is in the animated Notebook of John Doe's writings.

101573,5,0790729989,"Hollywood has a tendency to pull its punches with movies, like the film wants to say something, but at the end of the day the studio is more concerned with cuddling the audience, so the message falls flat.  Seven is one of those rare movies that makes it past the studio bigwigs and does exactly what it wants to do.  THe story is about a veteran detective (Morgan Freeman) who teams with an insolent, rookie cop (Brad Pitt) to catch a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who kills people in the style of the seven deadly sins.  Fincher (Fight Club) has a perfect sense of pacing and visuals and tells this disturbing, haunting story very well, making sure all of the punches hit home. This 2 set DVD is chock-full of movie-making goodness.  Although most of the included cut-scenes are mostly alternate or extended takes of shots, it is interesting to see the evolution of the movie.  Also, the features about the making of the opening credits are fascinating.  I never knew how much work went into that small portion of the movie.  The commentaries, although sometimes overcrowded with voices, are, as one would expect from Fincher, very informative and informal.  Fincher seems to really enjoy what he does and he has a lot of good stuff to say about his craft.  Although this movie has little onscreen violence, I can't recommend it to those that are soft of heart, some of the imagery is very disturbing.  For others, this is a must, and if fully stacked DVDs are your cup of tea, I also recommend Fincher's Fight Club, another 2 Disc set filled with goodies.",985651200,2,1557,4.629090909090909
101583,5,0790729989,"Wow! What an amazing movie, and the DVD version has more goodies on it than I have had time to explore so far.  What I love about the movie is that it is art - you can enjoy it on a purely visceral, gut-emotion, brain-dead horror/detective movie sort of way, but you can also enjoy it on an intellectual level.  Great scriptwriting in that regard - art should be enjoyable as it is, but has so much more meaning when one is left with questions and thoughts and a changed perception after seeing the art (whether film, music, paintings, etc.).  The cinematography is beautifully matched with the story - tight shots, many shots of the characters in confined and very dark places as they look at the mutilated bodies, lots of rain, a collection of great camera angles, and some freaky hand-held camera work.  The frenetic nature of the opening, and the plethora of angular, pointy fonts for the opening credits, all add to the moodiness and the spookiness of the film, and the sense of hopelessness for the present and the future that pervades the film.  The acting is topnotch, although Brad Pitt is every now and again a little too Brad Pitt-ish, but those moments are quickly over.  But mostly what is great is the story - a man so consumed with the desire to rid the world of its sins that he starts killing what he thinks are the worst examples of each sin.  I will not give anything away here, so keep reading - the ending is a total cliffhanger, and the real meat of the story.  All I thought was ""Wow!"" What would I have done in that situation?  And one is forced to sympathize in many ways with the killer - like Hannibal Lechter, he's very precise about the people that he kills.  Not random killing, and not for enjoyment or fun, but to rid the world of people they feel unfit for their abhorrent sociological/cultural interaction with the world.  For Hannibal, it's the artless non-cultured non-aesthetes; for John Doe in Se7en, it's people who exude sin, and by association, he's hoping to kill the whole culture that allows those sins to take place.  Kevin Spacey is a really spooky intentional murderer with a prophetic mission - his character is quietly spoken, reserved, and yet cold-blooded and lacking remorse when speaking of the murders. A chillingly acted role.
I do think the story has a few less-than-perfect moments, as other reviewers have noted, and I think the movie would have been stronger had those issues been addressed.  I would like to see more development in the relationship between Brad Pitt and his wife, and more usage of John Doe's bizarre apartment and his writings, which receive only minimal coverage.  I also wish that they would have found John Doe with a more interesting method than having someone illegally run a search on library checkouts for certain books.  That was just too easy.  But what was brilliant was John Doe giving himself up, the methods of killing, the cinematography, and the ending.  I loved Morgan Freeman's lack of action at the final scene - it added to his nihilistic demeanor, and made the characters that much more human, because they fail, and there is no happy resolution, just like real life often is.
Beautiful, brilliant writing, and wonderfully filmed.  An amazing movie that any detective story or horror story fan will like, and a movie that anyone who likes seeing the art of movie making will enjoy, even if they aren't so keen on detective or horror.
And as I said, this DVD version is a real treat - two DVDs, three different versions of the movie, and a bunch of other stuff.  Yow! Buy it!",985046400,,3572,4.632329635499207
101584,4,0790729989,"An innovative, atmospheric, smart, entertaining, creepy, tactfully-paced, and -- at its climax -- sincerely impacting thriller by David Fincher. Unlike many other movies of the same genre, Seven earns its chills soberly in the aesthetic, intellectual, and emotional arenas. This film elevated Fincher in my eyes from his previous work on the stylish & sound, but essentially needless commercial ""milk-it-for-all-its-worth"" success, ""Alien 3."" (It's a shame he would follow it with the well-intended but abysmally stupid ""The Game."")
Complaints are few. Just a little more time with the Gwyneth Paltrow character would've gone a long ways, and added more emotional resonance to the climax; but as the climax is already pretty riveting based on the content as it exists, this complaint doesn't carry too far. I wouldn't have minded the omission of a superfluous gothic trapping here or there, but I'm talking really minor things (my pervading thought during the opening credits was ""lose the NIN."")
Mm. Indeed, I think the fact that NIN figures prominently into the soundtrack and the irritating, trendy ""Se7en"" thing are the most bothersome facets of the overall Seven experience; and as they have no bearing on the content of the film itself, Fincher lands on pretty solid footing with his thriller.
Definitely recommended, and as far as I'm concerned, Fincher's best -- or, in deference to Fight Club advocates, at least his most *solid* -- film to date.",985046400,,1455,5.222222222222222

On the second disc are supplemental material such as an inside look to the making of John Does books and the making of the title sequence with alternate versions.

101587,5,0790729989,"One of the best and most frightening movies of the past 10 years, ""Se7en"" contains on the edge of your seat terror, great acting by the police duo of Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, and disturbing realism. David Fincher, who later directed ""Fight Club"", is on top of his game here, crafting a horribly disturbing script about a serial killer who matches his murders with one of the seven deadly sins. Freeman and Pitt watch as the murders become more brutal and brutal, as the corpses pile up and each deadly sin is fulfilled. And in the nail-biting last 30 minutes, the clever plot twist brings out the cold-blooded killer (played by Kevin Spacey in a small role).
This movie is made better by the chilly and dark environment that Fincher chooses to use for the city. The dark and rainy city streets make each murder seem worse and magnifies the frustration of Pitt and Freeman, who seem helpless in their pursuit of a killer that they cannot capture. The DVD is packed with extras, from actor-director commentaries to deleted scenes to alternative endings. You can see just how much work went into making this movie, from the crafting of ""John Doe's notebooks"" to set designs. The extras included in this edition of the movie make it A SOLID BUY, on top of the digitally remastered widescreen version of the film on the first DVD.
This is arguably Fincher's masterpiece, although with many movies ahead of him it is hard to say what he'll do next. Freeman has never been better, playing the grizzled cop vet teaching Pitt the ways of the street. An underestimated thriller upon its release, ""Seven"" will eventually take its place with ""Silence of the Lambs"" as the best horror-thrillers of its time.",984096000,,1699,4.723905723905724
101588,5,0790729989,"This is what a psychological thriller is supposed to be about. A movie all about atmosphere, mood and anticipation; the real horror is in our own minds created by our own fertile imagination - not spattered across the screen in gory shades of red. It's after the fact, after we've been thoroughly chilled by 'Seven' and are ponderously walking away, contemplating it's bleak message - it's then that we realize that we did not actually witness any of the murders. Our minds are the source of our own discomfort, we have disturbed ourselves.
William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), world-weary, seen-it-all, senior investigator on the homicide squad has seven (naturally) days to go until he retires. Eager, young detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) requested to be transferred to the division to work with him. Flattery?, not at all, and in fact they don't hit it off - Somerset a more cerebral thinking man's cop does not have the time to babysit Mills, or the patience to put up with his gung-ho attitude. This tension between the two principals is incidental to the story and is there mainly to allow Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) to act her role as peacemaker and more importantly, to place her in our minds as the one and only pleasant, happy and light presence in the whole movie (it's important at the ending).
The killer - 'John Doe' (Kevin Spacey) - is a real psychopath, sick, deranged and chillingly cunning and smart; always a step ahead of the detectives. He uses the seven sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and wrath as the motiffs for his crimes - and he IS very creative(?)in their execution. Even though it would appear so, it was not immediately apparent that the first crime was the crime of gluttony - a grossly obese man who, bound hand and foot, was forced to eat himself to death. The detectives simply knew there was a deeper meaning. After the second murder where the word 'greed' was spelled in blood, and with forensic evidence finding 'gluttony' at the scene of the first crime - Somerset shows why he is the brilliant detective that he is, and deduces that there will be five more crimes. Crimes of sloth, pride and lust take place with the detectives desperately but vainly trying to gues who, what, where and when as good detectives are won't to do.
Nothing however prepares us for the prelude to, and the execution of, the crimes of envy and wrath. The killer walks into the police station, blood dripping from his hands, confessing and giving himself up...it's over. Not at all. There is a purpose to the killers madness. He's about to conclude the sermon he's been preaching on sin, finishing the lessons to be learned. It requires all of us, the audience, Somerset, Mills, Tracy and 'John Doe' to be a part of one of the most shocking and numbing endings to any movie that I have seen in a long time.

Now in my opnion this is the definetive cop movie which is a classic, but can also be offensive and quite disgusting at times. I think the director merely had to make an impact, on the 1st commentary track on the SE DVD, he says they used the ending to fufill the audiences bloodlust, they had to to make money. Fair enough because I feel Fincher has created the only movien which Ican safely say is close to perfection. Freeman playing Somerset, the tired, old detective who just wants to leave but is drwan back in plays his part with such understatement but with a subtle power and energy which he seems to get from Brad Pitt's Mills that his perfomance just blew me away. Brad Pitt, in my opnion maybe one of the films weakest links, just doesn't really hit the balance between arrogance and likeability well enough. After all his character goes through you can't just help thinking that he is a bit of a... Kevin Spacey is a revelation, he just seems to play these charceters so beautifully, almost disintrested but still focused on their goal deep inside that he creates an unforgetable perfoance.

After the terrific credits the film is just flim-flam despite photography and actors.  Just style !!!...a remake of regurgitated ideas from ""Taxi Driver"" /the detective side.  Stick with ""Law & Order"" on any night.  Loved the credits!!!
Considering it was in New York, when can you simply travel to the desert in 1/2 hour..........? Or give a dinner party, and then explain to the guest AFTER dinner that your apartment is over a subway?",982627200,2,635,5.076923076923077
101604,5,0790729989,"The first few times I saw Se7en, I wasn't bowled over by it. I thought the story was somewhat weak, the acting (particularly by Brad Pitt, who looks green as grass in some scenes) could have been better, and there were some flagrant errors in it that, at the time, I felt were inexcusable.
Then, the Platinum Series DVD came out, and my opinion changed.
That's not to say that I think it's a brilliantly written film now (it still isn't - there's plot holes that rival the Grand Canyon). But, the beautiful DVD transfer puts a great polish on the best part of Se7en: David Fincher's incredible directing.
And as for the errors, well...some of them are still inexcusable (one in particular - we'll get to that later), but the second disc sheds a bit of light on the making of the movie, and one can really appreciate the amount of work that went into its production. From the meticulous crafting of John Doe's notebooks, to the intricate set design, to the amount of work that went into stylizing the killer's personal photographs of his ""work,"" you can really appreciate the behind-the-scenes work here (some of the aforementioned things barely have five seconds of screen time).
So, as far as the movie goes - 4 out of 5 stars. But, for the time and energy that went into crafting this excellent DVD (second only to Fight Club, in my view), including the packaging, which is almost worth the price itself - 5 stars. If only more companies would put this much effort into their releases.
Oh, and one other thing: If you're a fan of Se7en, and can't figure out which glaring errors I was talking about, well, here's a suggestion: pop your Se7en DVD into the player, skip ahead to 52:52 into the film, pause it, and carefully count the number of arms that are visible on Victor, the Sloth victim (HINT: that's not a bunched-up blanket next to the left side of his body).",982281600,,1868,4.545994065281899
101605,2,0790729989,"Okay - the art direction, film direction, acting (except maybe Pitt), and overall storyline is both compelling, gripping, and believable. Excellent in its ingredients - save one. The script is understandably disturbing, and forces the audience to come to grips with the a concept many of us choose to look over, what the Catholic tradition calls the 7 deadly sins. The goal of the killer in the movie was to do the same with the media and government, in his own disturbed way. This story would appear to give one the chance to reflect on the state of the ""human condition"" so to speak. However, I feel the movie ""Seven"" ultimately fails to do so in the way it could of, and in the end, fails to be the kind of movie I would hope for.
(PLOT SPOILER)  For example: at the end of the film, essentially ... wins, by luring Pitt into the final sin, humanity is lost in despair, and we all go home and kill ourselves. No, sorry, I would like to believe that there is a greater power that we can tap, than that of Sin (7 or otherwise) and evil, that is Love. That is why I think the film should have ended thus:
Pitt is shocked in the final moments of the film, and Freeman thus realizing what is happening, makes a choice in Love - turning and killing the killer, before Pitt can react. Voice over as Freeman turns and holds Pitt back - ""Sometimes we must make a choice to lay down our own lives, careers or otherwise, for the sake of our friends . . ."" Or something like that. Wouldn't that be much more inspiring? Hope in the midst of all that evil and death. All the blood and gore, and disturbing imagery in the end lack any need, being devices to evoke emotion, and in the face of the final message - No redeeming value, whatsoever.
Sorry. Try ""Shawshank Redemption.""",981676800,6,1766,4.335347432024169
101606,5,0790729989,"Seven is a profoundly dark and distrubing movie that will make you think even as it entertains.  By basing its protaganist's killings around the Seven Deadly Sins, it seperates itself from every other serial killer movie.  John Doe, in a stunning performance by Kevin Spacey, isn't just killing, he's preaching.  And he's doing so in a manner that is both appalling and intriguing.  As his pursuers, played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman close in on him, the viewer is constantly challenged by the nature of attrocity in a morally bankrupt world.
The DVD version lives up to the movie in every way.  While it offers the usual deleted scenes, animated story boards and production notes, what I enjoyed most was the commentary.  It is particularly interesting to hear the director's thought process as he was directing one of the great suspense movies of the last decade.

The credit sequence in itself is a work of art.  The acting is strong, and the script has the potential to shake you to your core.  All of these elements, along with Fincher's touch, make this one of the best psychological thrillers around.",980985600,,557,4.701030927835052
101609,5,0790729989,"When I originally saw this movie in the theater several years ago, I was unsure of my intial reaction to the film.  As a (not quite) typical teen girl, I went to see Brad Pitt on the big screen.  I left with an icky feeling in my stomach.
However, once I got over the not-so-happy ending (being the happy-happy-joy-joy sucker that I am), the film eventually ended up on my Top Fifteen list of favorite films.  I really love its dark tone--the low lighting, the unpolished look, everything.  For some odd reason, that type of film-making appeals to me.  ""Fight Club"" has the same look and feel, both of them being directed by David Fincher.  ""The Matrix"" also has that same feel in some places.
Anyway, the movie is about a rookie homicide detective, the naive and wanting-to-make-a-difference David Mills (Brad Pitt) getting reassignment to the big, bad city.  William Sommerset (Morgan Freeman) is the veteran detective on the brink of retirement.  He's intelligent and kind, but the city has hardened him and turned him into a cynic.
When a serial killer simply called John Doe (Kevin Spacey) starts murdering people in accordance to the seven deadly sins, Mills and Sommerset become temporary partners in order to catch John Doe.
The film is intelligently written and well-acted--one of Morgan Freeman's best performances to date.  The film has to be the most engrossing and intelligent psychological thriller of all time, better than ""The Silence of the Lambs.""  I also love the various references to classic literature--Dante, Hemmingway, Chaucer, the Bible, and even the Marquis de Sade (the latter being fitting with the ""sadistic"" nature of the murders.  FYI--Did you know the word ""sadistic"" or ""sadism"" cames from the Marquis de Sade's name?).
This is definitely not one for the kiddies.  It's very graphic and disturbing, but I love everything about this movie.  And the ending--although not happy--is definitely shocking and horrifying and fitting with the rest of the movie.  It's not enough to watch this film just once.
Umm . . . ""Seven"" also stars Gwyneth Paltrow (""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Emma"") as Brad Pitt's wife.
The DVD is fabulous.  Like ""Fight Club"" it contains two disks--one for the feature, and the other for the wonderful DVD bonus stuff.  Can't get enough of that--you know, the usual deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, behind-the-scenes, alternate endings, yadda-yadda . . .

Movie.
But why 4 Stars? I give the DVD 4 Stars because it doesn't include the TV Spots and the Audio Commentary with Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and David Fincher was not so good as I thought. It was boring in some places, but despite this. I can still recommend this Flick to DVD Fanatics and David Fincher fans (And they are a lot of you out there)",980380800,,730,4.335766423357664

Could you imagine Seven playing alongside Pretty Woman in a double-bill somewhere?Imagine comparing and contrasting those two?I have just watched Seven Platinum Edition. The extras are stunning,with four different commentary tracks to tell you everything about it,totally absorbing. However,its the film that matters,and out of all the new batch of directors of the last 5 years,only David Fincher and Paul Thomas Anderson have any talent for film. It is interesting the part New Line has played with both of these directors,and is proving to be the only studio with any balls.

If you haven't seen the movie this is the perfect opportunity to see it.  The second disk, supplemental material, is more interesting.  See the deleted scenes and extended takes, the animated storyboards of alternating endings, as well as, commentary from the director on the various scenes that he likes.

The only problem I had with this DVD, and something not mentioned as an extra feature..., is the PC Friendly software which you have to install if you watch your movies on a dvd-rom. It crashes quite often (I've seen it on more than a few computers), and the picture quality isn't as good as it is with other dvd's played through PowerDVD. I pipe my video card straight to TV and the sound to a Dolby 5.1 system. The sound is great, but the picture is off when played through a dvd-rom. On a regular dvd player it's fine however. All I can say is that he extra web features are great, but the player lacks a lot and you have no choice but to use the player that comes on the disc.

101625,5,0790729989,"The only thing missing in this film is any sizzle in the title.  The name pales in comparison to ""Dunston Checks In"" or ""Beethoven's Second."" What this film lacks in style, however, it makes up in substance. Not that ""Dunston Checks In"" lacks substance.
Seven is an extraordinary film.  So good in fact that my girlfriend almost wrecked her car post-viewing.  Then again, she wasn't what one would call a ""good"" driver, so the fact that she had seen it immediately before was probably just a coincidence.
The screenplay is original and airtight.  Fincher's direction is excellent.  It was an absolute sham that Seven garnered no major Oscar nods for 1995 because it was clearly the smartest and most haunting film of the year, despite Brad Pitt.  What makes it even better is the fact that Cliff's Notes make what I believe to be their on-screen debut half-way through.  Being that I was in high school at the time of release, I was exstatic to see that little yellow book on the big screen.
In the end the true measure of a film's worth is how long it stays with you.  Seven is one of those that never leaves, well, unless you have Alzheimer's.  Then you may as well not watch it because you won't remember anyway.",979948800,,1215,4.56221198156682

The movie is already creepy, but when you ""pump up the sound"" on this puppy you are in for a big treat.  You can hear all of the little noises that make your skin crawl.  What a rush!  As for the extras, well, knowing it was a Fincher release, and already having purchased Fight Club, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.

This 2-disc set replaces the old New Line disc that required you to flip the disc at a certain point. I thought laserdisc was dead? Anyway, as the supplemental disc details, the picture and sound have been reworked for this brilliant, atmospheric film.  I'm glad I didn't buckle under and buy the first version. My patience was rewarded many times over! After listening to the piece on the remastering of the film for home theater, you can see all the attention paid to the transfer of the film. And the biggest surprise is not only the beautiful picture, but the incredible DTS-ES(6.1) soundtrack on the disc! When will more studios release material with DTS soundtracks? (Are you listening Paramount? Braveheart would sound awesome with DTS!) The movie has never sounded better! People who have seen this movie previously know what it's about. And the people who haven't, should rent this disc and catch one of the best movies ever made. Fincher's use of lighting is incredible and now with the crisper transfer, the movie becomes even more foreboding. The chase scene through the apartment building has become the standard for all other chase scenes in future movies. The cinematography is second to none. Now, I know all of you people have heard this said about movies before, rented the movie, and then been completely bored with the characters.  I will not lie to you. The movie is dark, unsettling, and fierce. To say the least...But, it contains some very excellent performances by Pitt, Freeman, and another actor who showed guts by going uncredited on the box and in the trailers. The characters are fleshed out and intriguing. The best example of this is when Pitt tells Freeman off in a bar and goes home to his wife. You can see the uncertainty in Pitt's character as he tries to stand behind what he just told Freeman's character. The film then cuts to a disturbed Freeman who knows what Pitt told him is true even though he doesn't want to believe it. These little scenes pull the audience into the lives of these characters and make you feel like you know them. I will not disclose that info here and I hope my fellow reviewers show the same courtesy. This movie is great and every part of it has been tweaked to perfection, and after ""Fight Club"" one can only hope for more from Fincher. The man has talent as is evident on the screen. I hope everyone checks this particular disc out.

""Seven"" takes typical cop-film ideas and morphs them into a dark, creepy, memorable tale of serial murder. The violence of the film is psychological, because what's really disturbing is the things the film makes you think about, not on screen gore. Look closely and you'll see that there is not that much violence in the movie, it's the brilliant way in which Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker (8MM, Sleepy Hollow) set up mood and atmosphere. The cinematography is dark, beautiful and shadowy, giving the impression that there are evil things lurking in the shadows or just down the hall. The characters can be believed, and we really do care about them when the final shock comes. The performances are also superb, not least Kevin Spacey's serial killer, John Doe, who seems like a cousin of Hannibal Lecter. ""Seven"" also has a mind, the details of the plot are complex because they are not just materialistic things, you really have to think, to examine the ideas and thoughts in the story. This is the film, which I think, remains David Fincher's masterpiece. His latest, ""Fight Club,"" was less intelligent or memorable. It was good, but doesn't go in league with this masterwork of the macabre. ""Seven"" raises chilling little feelings in you, disturbing thoughts and ideas, which is what great horror is supposed to do, yet it never loses intelligence. This special DVD edition will offer more material to better understand the film's structure, there's even a look at the making of John Doe's notebooks.

By the way, I'm not comparing the two movies, I agree that they are completly different.  There is a bit of similarity between Lecter and Doe though.
Seven is a wonderful movie, and the credit for that should not go entirely to Spacey (seeing how he wasn't actually in the film until the end).  Morgan Freeman did a hell of a job (one of his best) and Brad Pitt (wow!! if only he'd stick to films like this and Fight Club).  I must not forget Pitt's lovely wife (in the movie) Gwyneth Paltrow, she did an excellent job for the small part she had (thats screen time, she actually has a lot do with the movie, you just don't see her that much.)

101648,5,0790729989,"In 1995, Director David Fincher joined Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in
the years most disgusting, tense and talked about films.  Seven is a
look into a persons liking for gore and blood, all done through the
theme of the 7 deadly sins.  Unlike Fight Club, another Fincher film,
Seven was made right before the DVD format was introduced.  The
initial release of Seven on DVD was less then spectacular.  The New
Line Platinum series is visually one of the most stunning releases to
come along in a while.  Sonically, this release will surround you with
sound elements of such clarity and depth, it may seem too real at
times.  The 2 disc package is similar to the Fight Club package.  It
has two nicely designed discs in an attractive package.  The menu
design on the discs are very impressive.  What may seem confusing at
first becomes quickly understandable and easy to navigate throughout.
Disc 1 has the movie along with commentary by David Fincher, Morgan
Freeman and Brad Pitt.  It also has commentary by the Screenwriter,
the Editor, a Professor of Film Studies and the new Line President of
Production.  These commentaries are very insightful, informative and
entertaining to listen to.  The scene selections are nice, shown with
still pictures and a title of each sequence.  Disc 1 also has a simple
'color bars' setup.  Picture quality of this movie is outstanding to
say the least, especially if you compare this release with the
previous DVD release.  The original negative was used this time, and
the darkness of this film has never looked so incredibly clear.
Contrast and colors are beautiful...not too saturated for this type of
film, but quite stunning.  Sharpness is well executed throughout the
film and I found it hard to see any grain or dirt on the picture.
This is obviously a first class transfer and the anamorphic widescreen
picture is superb.  Sound quality is even more amazing.  When you go
to your setup in the menu, you have a choice of English or French
subtitles.  You also have a choice of stereo Surround Sound, Dolby EX
Surround Sound or DTS ES Surround Sound.  Whatever type of system you
have, this film shines.  If you have a surround system with a great
subwoofer, you will not believe your ears.  This film has been rebuilt
from the ground up and remixed for DVD.  Effects elements and
atmospheric sound effects will simply blow your mind.  Dialogue is
clean and clear.  The sound department responsible for this soundtrack
should be applauded.  They did a superb job.  Disc 2 has a bunch of
extras that will keep you busy for quite a while.  The first extra on
the disc is an ""exploration of the opening title sequence.""
You get to choose from different angles and different audio options
while watching this sequence.  You can watch an early storyboard
drawing of the title sequence, a rough version of the opening and the
final version of the opening title sequence.  You can choose from a
surround mix, a Dolby EX mix that was made just for this DVD, or a
high quality 24bit/96Khz stereo mix.  It's amazing how many options
you get to pick from just to watch something about the opening title
sequence!  You can also listen to commentary by designer Kyle Cooper
or the Sound Engineers Brent Biles and Robert Margouleff.  Wow!  The
next pick on Disc 2 is where you get to see ""Deleted Scenes""
and ""Extended Takes"" from the film, all with or without
David Finchers commentary.  There are seven scenes to choose from and
are all fascinating to watch while listening to the commentary.  The
next pick on Disc 2 are the ""Alternate Endings."" You have
your choice of the original ""test"" ending with or without
David Finchers commentary.  You also can look at an animated
storyboard of an unshot ending.  This was done really well and both
offer subtle differences and insight into the ending that is in the
film.  Next, you can look at a bunch of Production Design stills with
commentary.  This was also done very well, considering how amazing the
Production Design really is for this film.  You next have choices of a
bunch of other still photographs from the film, including John Doe's
photographs, Victor's decomposition, police crime scene photographs
and production photographs.  These come all with commentary, and this
is the first disc where I actually enjoyed still photos on a
DVD....very well done.  Another choice you have on Disc 2 is called
'The Notebooks."" This is a very informative sequence of stills
with commentary on how those infamous notebooks were created.  When
you choose ""Promotional Materials,"" you can watch the
theatrical EPK or the movie trailer.  As with most DVD's, you can
choose ""Filmographies"" where you can see the resume's of all
the actors and many crew members.  Finally, for all you technical
people out there, you can choose ""Mastering for the Home
Theatre."" This is a fantastic look into the film to video
transfer of Seven, as well as the color correcting, telecine, audio
mastering and mixing of Seven for the theatre as well as the remixing
for the DVD.  All are played with scenes from the film comparing the
last release and this release of Seven.  The commentary is both
educational and entertaining to listen to.  In conclusion, Seven is a
must have DVD.  Picture quality is outstanding.  Audio quality is
fantastic, and the extras are wonderful.  If you loved Seven in the
movies, or want to replace your old DVD release with this one, buy
Seven and prepare yourself for 2 hours of amazement.  If you are a
lover of crime thrillers then get this disc. If you enjoy Morgan
Freeman, Brad Pitt or David Fincher then get this disc.  It would be a
sin NOT to get this DVD! Enjoy!",978480000,27,5660,4.75076923076923

It did not come on one side as is the standard for most movies now.  This release pays for all of the previous mistakes by adding commentary by Pitt, Freeman, and Director Fincher.

Never once do you sit there bored to death because the story is moving too slow.  The movie follows Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) and Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman).  Somerset is retiring and Mills is taking his place.  That is before a serial killer going by the name of John Doe (Kevin Spacey) strikes and begins his masterpiece of murders using the seven deadly sins.  I would have to say that this is one of the best movies ever made.  David Fincher continues his absolutely brilliant directing career as well.  This DVD offers some of the best extras ever.  With multiple commentaries with the actors, director, producer, sound.  Also included are quite a few deleted scenes that add to the background of the story, plus two deleted endings to boot.

101663,4,0790729989,"In 1995 David Fincher unleashed SE7EN upon unsuspecting audiences.  The movie was dark, grim, and unrelenting: An instant masterpiece, and for audiences in the know it presented a challenge in theater selection.  Prestige theaters, in select cities only were given master prints processed through the Silver Retention process (CCE) which in which the silver leached out during processing the negative is rebonded to the final master. (only a couple hundred of the 2,500 prints released underwent this process).  David Fincher and his Cinematographer Darius Khondji intentionally chose this process to enhance the contrast levels and also allow the film world to bleed into our own.  In his words ""I didn't want to see the frame around the screen""
In 1996 The Criterion Collection releases it's 4 disc, (7 sides) boxed edition of SE7EN amidst some of the most outstanding laserdiscs ever produced (Brazil, Dead Ringers etc.).  The Criterion SE7EN used a pristine CCE print to pull their master off of and was so exacting that the box actually included set-up instructions for your TV/Monitor to get best results, which had the pleasant side-effect of making all other videos look better too.  Additionally Ken Klyce (Sound designer) returned to remaster the film to optimize it for home theater viewing.  Criterion's SE7EN was packed to the brim with extras and supplemental material and is without a doubt one of the best laserdiscs ever produced.  Critics however note that the print is somewhat grainy and unstable, artifacts of the CCE process which David Fincher noted on his subsequent ""The Game"" laserdisc commentary, were somewhat intentional and present because he likes to push the print as far as it can possibly go.
In 2000 New Line Home Video releases it's Platinum Series DVD of SE7EN.  The new DVD promises even more bonuses and an even newer re-master of the film and audio masters to take advantage of even newer technology.  However here a major change in philosophy seems to have occurred, one which commentary on the DVD acknowledges and which film-bufs have been observing for some time with concern.  Rather than going to a pristine CCE print for it's video transfer, New Line went back to a master negative and digitally altered it to approximate a final CCE print.  While this has resulted in a DVD print that is cleaner, more consistent and less grainy there has been a significant cost.  The overall color tone, and contrast levels of the film are wildly different from the vision created by Fincher in 1995 and the clarity of the picture (or rather the apparent lack of it) no longer as clearly paralells the murky moral tone of the film.  It is significant to note that high contrast, and grain are things which DVD does poorly.  On the audio side changes have also been made.  The audio is again richer and cleaner, and gives better emphasis to the dialogue.  Environmental effects and ambient sound have however been mixed down both in tone and volume and as a result no longer has the same kind of visceral psycho-acoustic impact that it used to have (rain effects in the gluttony crime scene in particular spring to mind).
What we have here is a different bird from what Fincher hatched in 1995; one that may in many respects be more palatable and comfortable for the home theater audience (The DVD audience to be precise) but regardless it is a bird which was born beautiful, elegant and stunning and has had it's DNA noticeably tinkered with.  Yes the rough bits and minor flaws have been shed but so finely balanced was the creation that it was those very bits which gave the film it's primacy, strength and impact.  Ultimately the 1996 Criterion Laserdisc remains the definitive presentation of this masterpiece.",977443200,28,3747,4.92845786963434
101664,5,0790729989,"I thought this movie was incredible the first time I saw it - I love films that DON'T end the way you expect them to, that don't follow the safe and true path, so if you don't already own the videotape or the original DVD release, that alone is a great reason to buy (or at least rent) this new DVD.
We'll start off there...
1. It's simply a great movie.  A modern classic.  The screenplay is just brilliant.  The characters are developed and complex.  Screenwriter Walker hit upon a great idea and ran with it.  (And I am bitterly jealous.)  Even if New Line were able to get away with making it into just another cheesy cop flick, the idea would have been intriguing.  Walker went the extra mile, though, and pushed himself to try new twists and turns.  Kudos to him and directory David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and everyone else who pushed to keep the plot's integrity.  The acting is superbe, Gweneth Paltrow is a true angel and Kevin Spacey (yes, lovably average-looking Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"") just resonates with evil.
2. It's not just my assumption that New Line tried to ""emsculate"" (my word) the ""SE7EN"" script; it's on the record now with the ""Stars"" commentary track.  It's never been easy to get a movie made when it cuts against the grain (just ask Terry Gilliam).  Studio suits are notorious whimps when it comes to trying out new stuff, as Fincher, Pitt and Freeman attest to.  Though the suits may not think so, I think the director and actors are being nice - they don't name so many names.  But they do talk about the battle with the studio to keep the picture from being watered down and turned into just another blas&eacute; film version of a TV cop show.  Plus you get to feel like one of their buds as they talk fairly candidly about what was going on during production, their thoughts and feelings about the story, etc.  It is particularly interesting to list to Morgan Freeman analyse his character's psyche and hear how he came to certain acting choices - a gem for other actors.  The ""Stars"" audio track is often quite funny, too, as with Fincher and Pitt's observations about how the dead GLUTTONY guy was ""enhanced"" (again my word) to recompense the actor for having enduring hours of make-up and playing a stiff.
3. Speaking of commentaries, the ""Sound"" commentary track with Fincher, Author Richard Dyer, composer Howard Shore and sound designer Ren Klyce is an enlightening treat, one I've never experienced before (though I don't own every DVD out there).  They explain the complex process of applying the different continuous sounds of the city and music in a digestible fashion.  It'a fascinating, too, to watch the movie with the background noise brought to the fore and the dialogue and up-front sound effects cut out.  Very surreal.
And tying into that...
4. The sound has been remixed for the home theater, and it will blow you away.  There's background noise everywhere, just like in a real city.  It's crisp, it's clear, it's there in your face (or rather your ear, if you prefer).  Why, their creation is alive!  It's aliiiiive!
5. The ""Story"" commentary track with Fincher, Dyer, screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, editor Richard Francis-Bruce and New Line production president Michael De Luca breaks the story down piece by piece.  This track alone should be a film school student's dream come true; it dissects the movie nearly scene by scene.  Wannabe screenwriters and movie directors should listen to this track over and over again.
6. The picture quality on this new DVD cannot be overstated.  It has been transferred from the original negative and it is simply sumptuous.  It's not a post card, mind you, and it's not meant to be, but it no longer has that ""ER"" faded feeling to it, either.  For example, the all important color RED really JUMPS OUT out at you from the darkness now, adding to the creepiness of the moment.  When something is supposed to be disgusting, again like the dead GLUTTONY guy, it is.  It's just so real and vivid, like you're there in the moment.  It's unlikely that many movies will ever get the loving treatment ""SE7EN"" has received for this new DVD release, and it's a shame.  This makes those movies that have been rushed out onto DVD to make a quick buck (and there are plenty of them) look that much crappier.  (Ever see ""Splash"" on DVD?)  That's why people who love movies, and not greedy MBA schmucks, should run movie studios.
7. Although I've watched the movie's original opening (I think they could have kept it in, but with the new vibrating title sequence), there's still a ton of stuff on the second supplemental DVD I haven't yet had time to explore.  I have the ""Fight Club"" DVD, though, and even though that's a different studio (Fox), I am confident that David Fincher will not let me down, so my 7th reason for getting this DVD two-pack is all the fun exploring all the extra stuff, such as extended scenes, the fourth ""Picture"" commentary track, and veiwing the dead GLUTTONY guy frame by agonizing frame.  (If that's your thing, Sicko.)
This film may actually convince me to put off my mother's heart transplant so I can buy a DVD-ROM.

The running commentaries are humorous and inciteful, but it is on the second disc that this set truly gets going. I was amazed at how much detail the production design team went into to create John Doe's world. The photographs, the notebooks, and the masterpiece that is his apartment is unparalled. The examination of the world they created for this film makes you feel as if you are watching an actual documentary on a serial killer. The deleted and extended scenes are fun, and disturbing, especially the extended shots of the Pride murder scene. David Fincher firmly established himself as one of our generation most visual and compelling directors, and has never disappointed. His follow-ups, The Game and Fight Club, are just testaments to his talent and staying power. I will see whatever he puts out, and I hope the movie studios continue to do justice to his beautiful and frightening visions with DVD's of this caliber.

Disc 2 contains only one deleted scene, but does include the ""extended"" version of some scenes - optional commentary gives you insight as to why cuts were made. Only moderately interesting.  Lots of disc space is dedicated to crime scene photos created as props, but again not terribly gripping, at least not compared to what numerous other Special Edition DVD's have to offer.  After all the goodies we've seen added to DVD's of ""The Abyss"", ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", and New Line's own ""Magnolia"", ""Austin Powers"" movies, and ""The Sweet Hereafter"", DVD buyers are used to getting more behind-the-scenes documentaries, out-takes, marketing campaigns, etc.  Or maybe that's just what I was personally hoping for with this disc set. Granted, the 4 commentaries are great and insightful.  But I usually expect New Line Special Editions to go the extra mile with (as in this case) second disc supplemental materials.  I don't think they did in this case.  So, it begs the question -- rent it or buy it? Well, if you rent it, bear in mind that with the movie itself and 4 commentary tracks you'll need to watch it 5 times total to get all you can off disc 1.

The 1st being 2 cops tracking down a serial killer who has killed his victims according to the 7 deadly sins.  The second plot is about the growth of the relationship between the 2 officers who do not trust each other or like each other, yet are connected by their devotion for the capture of the killer.  Now, the 2 know that this is no ordinary case, and they know it is going to take a lot more than guns and fingerprints to track down this killer.  The third plot is how they know that the killer is more than just the average Joe, that this guy picks his victims with no remorse and no sense.  The cops know that the person they are tracking is not someone wo will leave a fingerprint at the scene, but they know that this person truly is evil, and they know that they can't win.  They know that in order to capture this guy, they must dive into his mind, and try to figure out what makes this guy click.

101673,3,0790729989,"The plot mechanisms of  *Seven*  are undoubtedly clever:  a maniac somewhere out there is murdering people, one by one, in order to illustrate some pithy points about the good ole Seven Sins  (Gluttony, etc., etc.).  This surprisingly old-fashioned mystery device is imbued by director David Fincher with some of the most ghastly palettes I've ever seen in a movie:  lowering grays of the sky, horrible rusts of the buildings of the inner city, cavernous greens of barely lighted interiors, et al.  The photography contributes to make  *Seven*  one of the most morose movies ever filmed.  Another contributing factor is Morgan Freeman's stunning performance as the head detective on the case, seven days from retirement, and deeply depressed.  The fact that Freeman makes this character, which is really a cliche, so compelling speaks volumes about his talent.  (Is this guy EVER going to get an Academy Award?  Talk about a Deadly Sin!)  Brad Pitt is -- for once -- perfectly cast as his cocky partner, providing a nice shallow contrast to Freeman's gloomy depths.
The movie loses ground, I think, after it prematurely reveals to the audience who the killer is  (Kevin Spacey, doing his  ""Kevin Spacey""  thing; in other words, Phoning It In).  Most of the second and third acts involve a rather tiresome cat-and-mouse game.  Nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before -- although, granted, the STYLE in which this is done keeps us morbidly watching.  And the ending succeeds in its aim, which is apparently to leave a very bad taste in your mouth.  (One removes the DVD from the player as if it's a dead wolf spider or something.)
Not the  ""classic""  some make it out to be, *Seven*  is nonetheless recommendable work by a director who really knows how to put grand muck on film.  Definitely recommended over his later film, the execrable  *Fight Club*.",976665600,3,1859,4.916129032258064

David Fincher is a great director, and I believe after seeing Alien3 and Fight Club that ""Seven"" would probably be very different if he had had total control over it. The mechanics of the film are great, but there is a hollow place in the center that keeps it from being brilliant.

101676,5,0790729989,"There is a hidden message in Se7en.  Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker sarcastically labeled Se7en as his ""loveletter to New York City.""
Sadly mistaken for simply ""just-another-horror-flick,"" Se7en has been done a grave dishonor by the majority of the viewing public who neither have the empathy nor the intuition to understand the deep message it carries.  Comparing this poetic and cautionary masterpiece to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a terrible misconception.  The Silence of the Lambs was an excellent film about the innerworkings of investigative profiling and the psychopathic personality (although only partly represented and definitely not generalizable to the psychopathic population of today) through Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  Se7en on the surface may seem similar - a film consisting of a plot about two cops ""hunting"" down a ""mad"" (another misconception) psychopathic serial killer.
However, under the skin, these two films are entirely different in contextual substance.
In The Silence of the Lambs, the plot is as deep as it goes.  The relationships and interactions between the characters are the core of the story.  Sentiments are decided based on the events that occur in result of another's actions.  That is as deep as it goes.
Rather than being ""plot-based"" entertainment, the themes in Se7en are theological, philosophical, moral, and cultural.  The entire film is based around the dialogue between Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (very well-portrayed by Brad Pitt), and the philosophy and motivation behind John Doe (Kevin Spacey in his best performance).  Within the film is the continuing philosophical dialogue between Mills and Somerset, two contrasting characters that happen to be working on the same side.  Mills' nature is impulsive, passionate, yet plagued with inexperience and naivete, while Somerset is weathered, subdued, with polished character, lore, logic and practicality, with a touch of lost hope.  Neither men are able to get much anywhere with the investigation (at least without a little bribery - another testament to why this movie is NOT about investigative profiling or techniques), as Somerset replied to Mills when Mills asked him what 'they were really doing if they weren't investigating,' ""just picking up the pieces.""
It is the weakness of Mills that leads him to be devoured by the wrath of John Doe in the end, a man, neither psychotic or equivalent to the Devil (yet seemingly so), but calculate, methodical, and patient.  On the same token, it is Somerset's experience and venerability that keeps him from being targeted by Doe.
 ""If we caught John Doe and he were the devil, if he were actually satan, that might live up to our expectations.  But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man,"" admonishes Somerset.
One of the most haunting ironies I find in Walker's script well portrayed by Fincher's cast is the uncanny similarities between John Doe, the antagonist and Somerset, the protagonist.  If you watch that one scene in the car, you will realize that Somerset agrees with Doe, yet although realizing that their consensus does not justify Doe's irrational, yet seemingly rational killings.  With Doe's philosophy explaining his intolerance for the prevalence and trivialization of the deadly sins, Somerset's continuous argument that we are becoming too apathetic of a society, only motivated by such things such as our temptations and self-indulgence, there is admittedly a strong parallex that exists between the two characters.  Yet, they stand opposed to one another, because while Somerset, although discouraged, managed to keep his faith in mankind, Doe did not, and could not tolerate the injustice any longer.
With the current decline in the immaterial and spiritual life, and the ascending obsessional mindset of psychological egoism, existentialism, atheism, and hedonism, there is no message needed more than the one represented in this fine film by Fincher.  We as a people must return back to faith, lest we become tyrants and slaves to our sins that will devour us in the end.
""You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it.  Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate it, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.""  - John Doe, Se7en.",975974400,218,4394,5.208806818181818

Colors, shadowings, sound, contrast have all been adjusted for optimum effect (one of the extras on disc 2 shows the before-and-after on several scenes). Just check out the green lamps in that library scene - WOW! The film is on Disc 1 and there are 4 separate commentary tracks...the most interesting one in my opinion is Track 2 which discusses the genesis of the project from script, to selling it to a studio and the fight to retain the original ending. Fincher is always interesting, but hearing Andrew Kevin Walker discuss his inspiration for writing the script and the struggles to get it made is even more fascinating. The voice behind one of the most original screenplays in years is pure genius.  ""Extras""-filled Disc 2 features deleted scenes (including the original opening)...most of which are just slightly extended scenes from the film (you see more of ""Pride"", etc.). There is also an alternate cut of the ending with different shots that was test-screened to an audience plus a storyboard of a different ending that was never shot. All of these come with or without commentary. An analysis of the opening credit sequence offers different angles and commentaries on 3 variants of the sequence. There are still galleries with commentaries by the photographers. Yes, ""Sloth"" victim's decay is included in the photos (unfortunately, not as clearly as it was presented on the Criterion LD) as well as John Doe's notebooks and lair. There is only one theatrical trailer (where are all the tv spots, etc. that were on the LD?????) and a short EPK. There are also some DVD-rom features on both discs (script-to-scene, etc.) to round it all out.
Only downside is that a lot of the extras on the Criterion LD are NOT INCLUDED HERE in any form. Although Criterion holds the rights to their original commentary track (Featuring Fincher, Pitt, Freeman, Rob Bottin , Walker, etc) and some other extras, surely NEW LINE owns the rights to the tv spots and other such promo materials. Where, for instance, is the great gallery of original artwork and poster concepts that so playfully used the number 7 or the sins as the backdrop???? New Line created these so why aren't they included here? The Criterion disc also had out-takes and many other things not included here, so don't ever toss that disc out! It's sure to be valuable some day. And with this DVD, which also includes items NOT on the Criterion LD, they combine to make the ultimate ""SE7EN"" collection.",975888000,176,2794,4.784679089026915
101678,5,0790729989,"SEVEN
A film that is felt more than seen, SEVEN ushered in a strange new approach to the maniac-tracked-by-cops genre. It initiated supreme suspense and only hinted at gory scenes, making the shocks all the more intense.
Brad Pitt is wonderful a as cocky and slightly dim cop paired with Morgan Freeman, a seasoned veteran. Both leads carry their roles with great verve, their abilities as actors truly underscore a film that could have unraveled without their pitch-perfect performances.
The New Line Platinum Edition of the DVD should be grand if it is an eighth as good as director Fincher's FIGHT CLUB DVD, a true trendsetter of the DVD format. I for one cannot wait.
A marvelous film like this truly deserves the platinum treatment, and I am glad to see that New Line Films understands this and will finally make available a DVD version worth crowing about. Kudos to the films's creators, the film company, and the actors for a movie that should stand the test of time and leaves most cat and mouse thrillers behind eating its dust.",973468800,7,1037,4.766666666666667

Unfortunately, the previous DVD release had barely any extras that a film of this caliber warrants. NOW, dvd-philes can feast on the amazing features available on the updated DVD.
A giant step up from the double-sided, feature-hungry weakling the original DVD disappointed fans with, this is a sure winner! With outstanding performances from Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gweneth Paltrow, and the powerful prescence of Kevin Spacey, and the intriguing storyline...plus the flood of new and exiting special features and commentaries, this is a must-have for any DVD collector.",973468800,6,674,5.3584905660377355

""Seven"" keeps one glued to the seat and makes one re-review certain portions of the movie to re-interpret storyline and director focal points...
In the end, Fincher appears to be a good director for one-view type movies. If he is able to make a step-up to the level of Sophmore director/writer M.Night such as his ""The 6th Sense"" which one can view over and over, similar to Lyne's ""Fatal Attraction"", to find hidden parts, he will succeed as a great director. If not, he will recreate the same movie over and over, and ""Seven"" will creat all future shadows for his movies to fall under.

101681,3,0790729989,"Seven presents many questions, but offers few answers.  That in of itself is not bad.  Too many films present simple questions with even simpler answers, force feeding the plot to the audience, telegraphing every turn of the story, basically treating the viewer as if he were a child.  Seven presents the viewer with a disturbing premise: a serial killer that uses the seven deadly sins (sloth, pride, wrath, gluttony, greed, lust, and envy) to plot a deadly killing rampage in a grimy, urban city.  The idea in of itself is not new, such as Vincent Price's Dr. Phibes (sp) using the ten plagues as inspiration for his murders.  But the environment and the execution of the murders is so disheartening, so oppressive, that it leaves the viewer exhausted and horrified, even if the level of actual on-screen violence is about par for movies of the sort.
The protagonists are two police detectives, played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.  Mr. Freeman plays the storied role of the cop who is one week from retirement, the man who has seen it all and is just waiting to get away from the race when tragedy strikes, and he must go on the hunt one last time.  Mr. Pitt plays the maverick up-and-coming cop, the young man full of energy and hunger, the cop who has yet to be beaten down and ground out by the city that he serves.  Mr. Freeman, as usual, projects an air of intelligence and wisdom, a man who has seen the seven sins up close many times over.  Mr. Pitt also delivers a good performance, and the audience feel his emotions and his doubts.
Their adversary is played by Kevin Spacey (this is not a give-away: this movie is not a whodunit).  He is intense as the killer, a perfect choice for the role.  Mr. Spacey is an actor that can play deadly, intelligent people like few other actors in Hollywood.  We can believe his character has undergone all kinds of trials to prepare the killings.  When he faces his pursuers, there is definite doubt as to which side will prevail.
Nevertheless, the movie left me dissatisfied.  For one, the plot unravels as it moves along.  It seems that the writers had spent all their energy on the first 5 murders, and then ran out of steam.  It quickly becomes clear to the spectator and the cops that these murders have been meticulously planned and researched for at least a year, and probably more.  However, the later murders are almost haphazard in choice, seeming that the killer, who carefully plotted his victims got tired towards the end.
This incongruity takes away from the experience of watching the movie.  Further, the atmosphere of the movie is so dark, reinforced by shooting the movie in a colder light, towards grays and blues, showing a lot of rain, the rumble of trains, and darkness of tight city corridors and alleys, that it leaves the viewer reaching for the surface to break away from this sea of darkness.  Maybe the moviemakers did too good a job of crafting the mood.  The ending in particular is too dissonant, again, because of the way the murders simply loose their carefully planned nature.  This is a shame, because this movie has a great cast, excellent atmosphere (if too dark), and a good premise.",972518400,2,3172,4.638640429338103
101682,5,0790729989,"This was the film, which I thought, really stretched Kevin Spacey's multi-faceted acting muscle (other than The Usual Suspects or American Beauty)! His psychopathic-homicidal role was chilling. Though, his identity is not revealed until later in the film, his whole execution of character was terrifying (as they say it's always the little quiet silent,harmless types you have to worry about). Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were in top form. While the film is often compared to Silence of the Lambs, the ending is a real shocker and an emotional roller coaster ride for Pitt's character (this also flexed his acting abilities as well). The murders are hideous and grotesque to say the least. The one disturbing and vivid scene hard to forget is the discovery of the victim who is kept intravenously alive (barely)! The glutton victim scene almost made me lose my cookies as well. The special effects department is highly commended for a superb job,also...Certain scenes are not meant for viewers with weak stomachs !",972518400,2,1015,5.083832335329341
101703,5,0790729989,"Calling SEVEN a detective thriller is almost like calling ANNA KARENINA a romance novel.  Still, ostensibly that's what it is.  It deals with the hunt for a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) committing murders based on the seven deadly sins.  The job of finding him falls to two police detectives:  Somerset (Morgan Freeman)- a wise, dignified  but burned-out veteran, literally days from retirement- and his partner, Mills (Brad Pitt)- an impatient, ambitious newcomer.
While SEVEN is a rollercoaster of disturbing surprises, it's hardly just a lurid thrill ride. The final twist is a horrific reminder that murder is a human tragedy and that even ordinary human failings won't escape this killer's fanatically pitiless judgment. There are illustrations throughout of the indifference and dehumanization on which evil thrives- the sex shop owner who casually custom-makes a potentially lethal erotic aid, for example.
Be warned: SEVEN is extremely graphic. (At the morgue, for example, you see everything they kept out of frame on QUINCY. And then there's Sloth...)  The visual design creates a fittingly dank, decaying urban environment.  My favorite scene, however, was Somerset doing research after hours at a library while a radio played classical music.  It's a transcendently serene moment in a violent and corrupt world.
There are fine performances.  Although Pitt is well cast and Spacey gives the killer a fine, restrained portrayal, the real screen presences are Gwyneth Paltrow (Mills' wife, Tracy) and Freeman.  Paltrow, of course, is one of the great beauties of our time but Freeman's quiet charisma is amazing.
The DVD is somewhat awkward. It must be flipped over. The scene selection feature indexes large chunks (the sins, mostly) not the numbered scenes. While cast bios seem thorough (Freeman was on ELECTRIC COMPANY!), there are no interviews or documentaries.  Still, little can diminish this film's power.",972432000,5,1923,5.376666666666667
101704,5,0790729989,"A gentleman I talked to once said he didn't like this film because the police never turned on a light in any room they went into.  Apparently, he forgot this was a movie.  I was impressed not only by the cinematography and art direction and set design but by Brad Pitt's ability to maintain a high level of acting skill opposite the great Morgan Freeman.  This is not a film for the squeamish.  Even if the scenes of violence acts pale next to the slasher films of the past several years, the intention and the theme of this movie are enough to perpetuate nightmares.  Unlike many horror films, this suspense thriller WILL make you think.  And sometimes the human mind is a scarier landscape than the film screen.",971049600,,713,4.53125
101705,5,0790729989,"Seven is one of the greatest, most atmospheric thrillers ever made.
Andrew Kevin Walker takes, what seems to be on the surface, an unoriginal concept and makes it his own; producing one of the most original screenplays of the 90's.
David Fincher does a fine job as the director of Seven. His direction compliments the gritty screenplay nicely. He effectively brings the script's many stunning suspense sequences to life.
Howard Shore gives us a great restrained and ominous musical score.
Darius Khondji's cinematography also pays respect to the script by making the images on screen very dark.
The set design is wonderfully detailed and greatly adds to the mood.
Brad Pitt is pretty good as the cocky detective, David Mills, but he could be more dramatic in some of his more emotional scenes. Morgan Freemen is good but I feel that he underplays his character, William Somerset, a bit too much sometimes. Kevin Spacey gives the best performance of the film as the psychopath, John Doe. He speaks his lines with cold brutality. He is riveting to watch.
Seven's pacing is good for the most part; one or two scenes tend to drag on a bit too long, but I suppose this is to help build the suspense.
Seven is a great film; a cinematic gem of the 90's.
This is probably my favorite DVD. The picture quailty of this DVD is good. The commentaries and featurettes are very informative. I like how Fincher's tone and manner is almost conversational in the commentaries.",971049600,,1459,4.770750988142293

The story begins with Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) being assigned to Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman). Detective Somerset is due to retire at the end of the week, and Detective Mills is moving up in the world, and is to take Somerset's place. This is a very disturbing movie. It will keep you enthralled and glued to your seat for the entire 127 minutes. Indeed, I was staggered that I never once lost concentration or was bored with this movie. This is a movie with an unexpected ending that is absolutely unpredictable and which is not at all a ""Hollywood"" style ending.
The disc itself. The movie is presented in Anamorphic compared to the old letterbox version and this is great to see the film finally in its full glory!.The detail is quite good and crisp with very few problems (odd shimmer effect in certain scenes). The sound is recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1 which has no audio sync problems and the use of the surround mainly during rain sequences adding tone. The track was bass heavy in spots and gave the .1 channel a working. There is a number of extras on the second disk, featurettes - morgan freemans diary - directorys commentary, production notes and Star bios.

Seven is good only because everyone involved from Morgan Freeman to Brad Pitt gives out standout performes.

Incredible performances from Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey.  Now I've read the screenplay for ""Se7en"" and the film really stays with the screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker.  The differences from the screenplay to film is the entire beginning, a much longer/slightly different ending and very small character details.  These should all be included on this 2 discs DVD release and much more.  It's great to know that the director and the entire cast fought the studio to have the ending as close to the screenplay as possible.  Of course the studio wanted the ending to be more censored.  But let me tell you ""Se7en"" has one of the very best endings to a film.  It really completes the film to make it a great film.  A Top 10 of all time type movie.  Needless to say anything I write about the plot will somehow spoil it for those who know nothing about the movie.  The contrast between Detectives Mills and Somerset is incredible yet in the end they stand for the same ideals.  Well it's about a killer named John Doe who uses the seven deadly sins against the sinners themselves.  Detective Mills is the younger of the 2 detectives; he's just full of life and energy.  He really loves his job.  Detective Somerset the older, more patient is on the verge of retirement.  He won't miss the big city and all the crime too much when he retires.

Maybe this  was too realistically disgusting or maybe it was just bad.  Either way, I thought it was revolting and sadistic.  Even if the movie's makers are getting such a kick from torture, there should be some kind of ""wink"" at the audience, an acknowledgement of evil within us all, or something.  Or maybe I just want a different movie because I hated this so much.
The atmosphere was fairly well done and Kevin Spacey is Kevin Spacey, which is of course to say, he's great.  He has all your attention when he's on screen.  The other leads are wasted or bad.  Brad was just bad.  The pacing is deadly slow in places -- one can't get by on atmosphere alone.

The exact nature of her demise was one I couldn't have guessed..until I saw...""the package""...

101727,1,0790729989,"I don't want to comment on the movie as such, because there are enough reviews out there - just a short comment : this film is fantastic.
The DVD on the other hand is awful. There are 2 things which I noticed once I  popped open the case and threw it into the player:
first: the movie  plays over 2 sides of the DVD. You actually have to pop the DVD out at  about 60 minutes into the movie, turn it over, and then you get to watch  the second half. I find this annoying considering that a dual layered DVD  can store 2 and more hours of video on one side...
second: the video  image is non-anamorphic widescreen. that's not really a bad thing  altogether, but in this case it kills all the fun you could have watching  the movie. the black letterbox bars at the top and the bottom of the image  ""flicker"" throughout the entire movie - since the format of the  visible image is 2.35:1, the black bars are rather large. The consequence  is really that the entire image seems to ""flicker"", because the  black widescreen bars are colored different shades of black 4 times a  second. basically, the only way you'll get rid of this flickering effect is  to turn the brightness of your TV or computer monitor down. however,  considering that ""Seven"" is already a rather dark picture,  turning down the brightness results in seeing only pitch-black. the visible  image (i.e. the image ""between"" the letterbox bars) is really  great. if the picture had been mastered anamorphic, then this would be an  excellent video transfer.
another disappointing thing is the lack of  extra features. having seen the laserdisc ""criterion"" edition of  ""Seven"", I find this DVD release rather insulting. The background  information on the stars does not at all compensate the lack of, say, a  commentary audio track, or some behind-the-scenes vignettes, or other  extras (the laserdisc ""criterion"" edition featured hundreds of  still images - like the pictures that Mills and Sommerset find along with  one of the tortured victims, and other pictures from the set).
I  sincerely hope that New Line will decide to release a decent DVD some time  in the future. Untill then, I suggest to keep away from this DVD - the most  important argument being the poor video mastering (i.e. the flickering of  the widescreen bars).",963100800,28,2294,4.7052896725440805

* * *

I was told that the movie lost a lot in transition to the small  screen. If this is the case, I'm considering renting the film reels and  arranging a private screening for myself at Cinemark, because this is  simply one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. Yes, we have the  same formula as we had in The Bone Collector and a hundred thousand other  films-- two cops get thrown together on a case neither really wants, and  they don't like one another much. But that's where the formula stops. Brad  Pitt and Morgan Freeman can't stand one another. Brad Pitt's wife, expertly  played by the annoying Gwyneth Paltrow, attempts to smooth the path between  them. And all the while a killer is baiting the two of them with murders,  tortures, and various other brutalities based on the seven deadly sins.
  I didn't care that it was cut with commercials every fifteen minutes like  clockwork. I didn't care that many of the more gruesome scenes (which were  described to me in detail where they would have been) were left out. I  didn't care that the overdubs were, in many places, silly. From moment one,  this was simply the most absorbing move I've seen this year, and probably  in the last five years or more. I was completely captivated by Brad Pitt's  obsession with the case, Morgan Freeman's desire but inability to walk away  when the day of his retirement came, the stark camerawork (especially when  the killer reveals himself-- an exceptionally powerful scene in an  exceptionally powerful movie), the excruciating details of the plotting,  many of which had an insanely sick humor to them. I found myself laughing  at this movie a whole lot more than I expected to, another strong point in  its favor.

Morgan Freeman knows better--it's the enemy inside you, the  enraged being that wants to smash the heads of his enemies, that's what  really needs watching.  John Doe is this death wish incarnate--he hates the  world and wants to obliterate it and himself.  Rarely have I seen a movie  that so stylishly presents a contemporary mood (just check out those  opening credits; you would think Trent Reznor had something to do with  them.)",961113600,,736,4.918032786885246

101742,5,0790729989,"Seven is a very disturbing thriller about a serial killer,John Doe(Kevin Spacey), killing people via examples of the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath.  The story begins with  Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) being assigned to Detective Somerset (Morgan  Freeman). Detective Somerset is due to retire at the end of the week, and  Detective Mills is moving up in the world, and is to take Somerset's place.  This is a very disturbing movie. It will keep you enthralled and glued to  your seat for the entire 127 minutes. Indeed, I was staggered that I never  once lost concentration or was bored with this movie. This is a movie with  an unexpected ending that is absolutely unpredictable and which is not at  all a ""Hollywood"" style ending.
The disc itself. The movie is  presented in its origianl form, 2.35:1 aspect ratio, letterboxed not  Anamorphic. The picture is dark in itself however the detail is quite good  and crisp with very few problems (odd shimmer effect in certain scenes).  The sound is recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1 which has no audio sync problems  and the use of the surround mainly during rain sequences adding tone. The  track was bass heavy in spots and gave the .1 channel a working. There is a  small section of extras , a 6 min featurette, production notes and Star  bios. My only complaint is this disc however a FLIPPER, yes it is on 2  sides!, split after the conversation between Morgan freeman and Gweneth  Paltrow in the coffee shop. Just as suspense is building the film requires  a turn over. Please note film distrubutors this is annoying and in the age  of DVD unnecessary. I hope that the film is re-released as a dual layered  film and includes some of the extras from the Lasedisc version.
All said  and done the film is one of the best, along with Silence of the Lambs, in  its genre and the disc even with its faults is a qaulity purchase.",960854400,107,1914,4.627976190476191
101743,5,0790729989,"There is a key scene a Se7en that shows exactly why this is one of the best thrillers ever made as opposed to your run of the mill serial killer movies. The Swat team are all dressed up for the bust, they move swiftly,  rifles in hand towards the suspect's apartment complete with the  complementary ""thriller music"" on the soundtrack. But then all of  a sudden, the world weary detective Somerset(Morgan Freeman) looks at his  overeager younger partner and says of the swat team ""They love  this."" Becuase Se7en, arguably the greatest film in its genre, is not  a film in need of cliches.
  I am aware of how bizzare this sounds given  the subject matter of the film, but Se7en is a beautiful looking film. Like  the horrifying images in Dante's Divine Comedy which features heavely in  the plot, Se7en's gruesomeness is startling, gripping and poetic. Director  Fincher and his cinematographer create their unnamed city from hell with  bleached colors, darks blacks and browns, deep shadows and dark wood  furniture. Infact every frame of this film could be frozen and submitted to  an art gallery. One particular shot of the killer holding a gun to Mill's  head in the rain with his face out of focus is breathtaking.
  Atmosphere is vital for this film's effect, but its undeniable success is  because of its superior script, acting and direction. Morgan Freeman's  performance as the world weary and very lonely Somerset is a masterclass of  acting, his performance subtle and brilliant. Somerset is a man so  depressed with the ugliness of his city that he admits to his partner about  their case ""We're picking up the pieces, collecting diamonds on a  deserted island."" A man so disturbed by his surroundings, that he  leaves a highly annoying thermometer clock loudly ticking in his grim  apartment. As irritating as that clock is, it is at least constant.
  Se7en is also the first (and probably the last) film to break Hitchcock's  famous rule, he said ""There is no horror in the boom, only the  anticipation"". While it would be a crime to describe the film's  ending, lets just say that there is indeed ""horror"" in it. It is  a blow to the gut.
  There have been countless pretenders, one star  garbage the throw serial killers into the mix to add thrills to their  pathetic narratives (The Bone Collector stand up), but Seven creates an  entire new world, where it rains all the time and chronic apathy is only  treatable by death. What the killer says of his work is also applicable to  Fincher's masterpiece, this film will be ""remembered, studied and  followed"". Becuase Se7en is not merely a film, it is A STATE OF MIND.",960422400,3,2636,4.758314855875832
101744,4,0790729989,"Seven is one of those disturbing films that left me at times wishing it was less, yet also wishing for more.
The ""Mores""
The acting is very good throughout the film.  The actors kept these characters firmly  based in reality; I could believe that I would find these people in the  NYPD or any police department.  In fact, if the characters were allowed to  go ""over the top"", the story would have suffered a great deal.  Specifically, I liked Morgan Freeman's take on Detective William Somerset  (the cynical ""old hand""); his interpretation left the impression  that William had seen it all and had had enough.  Nothing seemed to faze  Somerset.  Brad Pitt's take on Detective David Mills (the ambitious and  opportunistic ""new guy"") was spot on.  I liked the charm and  affection shown between his character and Gwyneth Paltrow's Tracy Mills.  Kevin Spacey was great as John Doe; his take of the character, with the  clinical self-detachment, kept his scenes from going over the top.
The  ""Lesses""
The film is very intense and is not meant for  children.  In fact, if you are disturbed by stories that delve into evil  and the effects that evil has on ordinary people, then avoid this film.  At  times the film dwelled on the images of the victims; the effect was almost  of a forensic photographer filming the scene for evidence.  There isn't a  log of special visual or audial effects, music is at a minimum; the general  feel of the film is very spare.

""Seven"" has got  to be the best written, most suspenseful, and most chilling serial killer,  no make that movie, of all time. Everytime you think you can predict what  will happen, BAM, you get hit with another twist. And they over do the  suspense. They don't make the villain some shocking unbelievable character,  it's the kind of person that would be a Real killer.

101748,5,0790729989,"Seven"" is a film that achieves the rare distinction of being a thoughtful crowd pleaser. Unfortunately, the public seems to have been taken largely with the surface elements only, the suspense and the gore. The film is indeed a visual masterpiece, in look and feel borrowing inspiration from the nightmarish works of such photographers as Joel Peter Witkin and Matt Mahurin. Director David Fincher is clearly in synch with Andrew Kevin Walker's riveting screenplay. All of this makes for superlative entertainment, but there's much more here than just an exciting story. The message of ""Seven"" is the primary reason for it's importance.

On the surface, ""Seven"" is an ingenious thriller detailing the hunt for a particularly pernicious serial killer who, with great aesthetic imagination, dispatches his victims using the seven deadly sins as his model, one victim per sin. The hunters are two detectives. The first is Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a tired, very jaded man only days away from retirement who sees little good in human nature and has given up hope of ever improving the world around him. The other is Mills (Brad Pitt), green and full of fire for righting the many wrongs in society. This attitude provokes only sad amusement from Somerset, who views it as the product of a naive mind. The two are made partners in the search for John Doe, the mysterious psychopath of the piece, and the opposing viewpoints held by these two men form the basis of the conflict in the film.

""Seven"" poses these questions: Why is the world so full of darkness, violence, selfishness, and cruelty? Just who is responsible? Is the act of sinning the exclusive domain of serial killers and other extreme reprobates? Or is it possible that we ourselves, in our own less noticeable way, contribute to the everyday hell that the nameless city in the film represents? In a moving scene early in the film, the investigative styles of the two detectives are contrasted. Somerset sets to work in a public library, edifying himself calmly through the study of books as to the killer's possible inspirations for his murders, while the young Mills mentally struggles with the case at home using a brain so lacking in knowledge and education as to be utterly useless. It is a sequence celebrating the beauty and power of learning, without which wisdom and compassion are likely to be developed. Without these things, the chances for a better world are slim.

In the end, ""Seven"" is a deeply moral film, a dark cry of anguish over the state of human behavior. It sees very little hope of ever reversing the natural self-serving impulses of the average human being, yet it demands that we not turn away. It demands that we make the effort to improve the world and ourselves.",958608000,,2753,4.878205128205129

101750,5,0790729989,"Seven is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen.  Perhaps this statement is too vague.  Well, consider the story.  A serial killer named Jon Doe, played flawlessly by Kevin Spacey, who is disgusted with society  and considers it his destiny to rid the world of seven people who have  committed one of the seven deadly sins.  From the writers, actors to the  set crew, each deadly sin is showcased with perfection and mystery.  I must  say that Brad Pitt moved to the next level of acting with his role as the  novice detective partnered with Morgan Freeman.  Freeman is depicted as the  rusty old detective who can no longer apathize with society of it's decay.  However instead of retirement, Freeman stays on in an attempt to help Pitt  stop Jon Doe before he nails all seven sins.  After seeing Seven, I tried  to imagine what other quality actors might have been chosen instead of  Morgan Freeman.  None came to mind.  While I'm raving about the actors of  this film, I must say I fell in love with Spacey.  Words cannot describe  the abilty of this man.  Spacey didn't PLAY a serial killer.  He became  one.  His ability to transform himself into Jon Doe was the tip in to  making Seven a five star film.  Don't rent it.  Buy it.  You WILL watch it  more than once!",958176000,2,1279,4.454148471615721

101762,5,0790729989,"A lot of other reviewers keep comparing Seven to Silence of the Lambs; I think what makes this valid is that, like Lambs, most of the most disturbing imagery in Seven occurs in your own head. Remember the turnkey  showing Clarice the picture of the nurse Lechter bit? We never saw it, and  our salivating imaginations produced a special effect worse than anything  the filmakers could have. In Seven, the worst bits are the decriptions of  Doe's methods and the autopsy results (the actor playing Lust conjures up  Hell on Earth with his account of the tryst with the hooker).  I said  salivating earlier because I think another point of this movie is to make  the viewer address his/her own apathy towards our shared moral decline. On  SOME level, John Doe's perceptions make sense--no, not to the degree that  one would advocate his actions, but his argument with Pitt about ""only  in a (blank blank) world like this would these people be called  innocent"" had merit. It also questions our opinion about crime and  punishment--the swat team member leaning over the nearly dead pedophile and  telling him he deserved his torture weighs heavy in the chest. I sat up  half the night with a close friend after seeing this and discussed it--we  felt like we had to, just to get it in some logical place in our heads  before we could sleep.

So were does Seven mangage to fit into all  of this. Seven is buy far one of the most cleverly written and disturbing  chillers around. Serial killer John Doe (Spacey) deserves his place along  the psycho hall of celluloid fame amongst the likes of Hannibal Lector and  Norman Bates. When a body is found by the two leading protagonists, Pitt  and Freeman, all evidence points to the new emergance of a sick and twisted  mind. It soon becomes clear that the killer is using the seven deadly sins  as his modus operandi, in order to cleanse the world of all its past  misforgivings. In your face direction by Fincher and one of the most gut  wrenching climaxes ever seen on film will jangle the nerves and leave you  shaken and stirred.

You're horrified, you're exhilarated, and all through-out, the screenplay by  Andrew Kevin Walker (8MM, Sleepy Hollow) keeps you thinking and putting the  pieces together of a macabre, perverse puzzle of serial murder. Like  ""The Silence Of The Lambs,"" ""Seven"" effectively takes  us into the dark corners of the human mind, using two detectives as the  vehicles into this dark journey. The cinematography is rich in it's use of  shadows and colors. What's effective about the structure is that we can't  quite see what we would like to see, which is more horrific. Kevin Spacey  gives an incredibly good performance here as a psycho and ranks with  Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter. I loved how Fincher keeps the gothic  mood in every scene, we never quite feel easy even during simple scenes of  conversation. The plot is gruesome, but intriguing. What is disgusting is  done with style, Fincher keeps the artistic values of the story strong,  instead of just focusing on grossing us out.

There is also a ton of style here by the  brilliant David Fincher (again, in my opinion, one of the best directors  alive).
Seven is very dark and very interesting visually - it presents  New York as a hellish, wet, urban nightmare. A serial killer is on the  loose, punishing those who commit one of the 7 deadly sins; you know the  storyline. Each murder is more chilling and gruesome than the last. We  watch as Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (who are BOTH excellent in this) try  to catch ""John Doe."" Warning: this next part is a spoiler, but  you probably know this already. John Doe turns out to be played by the very  talented Kevin Spacey, who is absolutely chilling in this, one of his best  performances.

Pitt really sinks his teeth into the role, and does not stand around the  entire time looking pretty.  He is a young cop in a tough city, and you can  feel it.  His partner, the older wiser Morgan Freeman, just oozes  intelligence and patience.  I have always admired Freeman's acting, and  this is just one more reason why.  Their somewhat mismatched partnership  leads them to one of the most bizarre serial killings that I have ever  viewed onscreen. Each connected murder just becomes more gruesome with each  turn, building up to one of the most twisted climaxes in the history of  filmmaking.  For me, the best part of the film is the brief appearance at  the end by Kevin Spacey; his character alone is enough for me to watch it  over and over again.  I really like this film; it is one of the few  intelligent moments in moviemaking of the 1990's.",945302400,,1003,4.447513812154696
101806,5,0790729989,This movie has a lot to offer.  I have written reviews for a lot of movies in amazon.com but I think this one might be the easiest to tell to you people who are reading.  Seven is a DARK movie and that gives it a little  bit of thrill.  The best thing in this movie is the acting and the well  performed scenery.  This movie is a good addition to your Drama section on  your video shelf maybe even suspense.  It is amazing the way this man  (jondoe) is able to keep every single murder perfectly secret until he  wants it exposed.  This movie also is very well written.  Each clue is  perfectly detailed and every murder has it's own thing to tell the  detectives: Mills (Pitt) and Somerset (Freeman) about the next murder that  happened so that they never lose track of anything.  I am not going to tell  you the ending but it will come as quite a shock to most of you.,944956800,,870,4.175757575757576
101807,2,0790729989,"I love most things dark, opressive, disturbing and stark, but this predictable-from-the-start investigation into the underbelly of human depravity failed to hold me past the thrid deadly sin. Creepy and  sickening, I enjoyed the dirty feeling this movie left me with, but when  the credits hold a higher artistic value than what's between them, it's  hard to recommend a purchase.",939081600,3,380,5.3
101808,5,0790729989,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Morgan Freeman is amazing in this film.  Kevin Spacey as always put out a great performance as John Doe.  This movies has you thinking until the last minute just like  Fallen, then it hits you like a train.  This is also one of the most  violent movies I have ever seen but that only tells the story more indepth.  I suggest getting it for everyone or at least renting it for a weekend.",936403200,,436,4.119047619047619
101809,5,0790729989,"An absolute masterpiece,  a beautiful blend of horror and mild black comedy,  Seven has , and will be for years to come,  been on top ten movies of the week,  month and year...soon to be a hot classic.  Brad Pitt and  Morgan Freeman do a very well illistrated,  understandable and touching  portral of a Killer out to reinstate the 7 deadly sins by murdering those  who disobey them.  Gywenth Paltrow and Kevin Spacy have minor co starring  roles but the real credit goes to director Daive Fincher (The Game,  up-coming Fight Club),  who paints New York in the bleakest of bleak ways  and gives the movie a very unique touch.  A very sad, down-to-earth movie,  it deserves to be a must see.",936316800,,690,4.532786885245901
101830,5,0790729989,"This film, one of the best of the serial killer genre, the latest being the superb 8mm. Seven cries out for the director's commentary on the DVD.  Still, well worth purchasimg.
Brad Pitt is surprisingly good; of course  Kevin Spacey is always so great.  I am also a Morgan Freeman  fan, so where  could I go wrong?",933379200,,314,4.43859649122807
101831,5,0790729989,This is the BEST movie of the 90's. For once an american movie without a happy Disney ending!! The script is diffrent and interesting. A must see for anyone with a brain and the ability to think.,933120000,,195,4.297297297297297

101833,5,0790729989,"This....story and I call it a story because it's not just a movie to me. It just so happens that Andrew Walker wrote the greatest movie ever written and it made more than 95 million dollars. I have The Seven Deadly Sins  tattooed in red on different parts of my body and needless to say it is  something I strongly believe in. I'm not going to ask that you  ""like"" this movie. I only ask that you understand it and if you  understand this movie then you've just taken a step to being human. As far  as ""hey do I want to see a good movie tonight"" you could watch  something else but if you haven't seen Seven it would be a Sin not to!",926640000,,633,4.024

The only thing that kept me watching this film past the first 10 minutes was that I paid money for it and Morgan Freedman's performance.  Other than that, the movie was a circus freak show with the Marquis de Sade as the ringmaster.",1525651200,,282,4.203703703703703
7791242,5,0790729989,"Chilling, disturbing, and realistic about the ugliness and darkness in human nature. While the villain is ""crazy,"" he knows what triggers humans, how to manipulate emotions and to make his point clear. His point came across loud and clear.

It is poignant that the enthusiastic rookie (Pitt) faces ruin by the end of the film, and it is the pessimistic older detective (Freeman) who survives the case, and perhaps becomes a bit more hopeful after such an encounter.",1525219200,,465,4.961538461538462
