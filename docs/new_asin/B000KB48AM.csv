2687962,4,B000KB48AM,"The strength of this film was in the mood created. I loved the use of colored lights and shadows in the gritty ""slummy"" streets and apartments of Sao Palo. Rugged and distinctive faces, some beautiful female faces. All in all this was photographically quite engaging for me.

The characters were interesting in terms of adding to the rough mood. Sort of end of the road types. They got most interesting for me toward the very end as people with deeper motivations than it might have seemed earlier in the films.

Dialogue was okay for me. Performances were compelling in some scenes. Fraser was great, though he played a quite unpleasant guy.

I must say that the script was too loose for my tastes. A bit too much coincidence. Yet this did not really spoil it because the overall mood creation and movement was so strong.

Nice film making.",1357257600,,841,4.662162162162162
2687963,5,B000KB48AM,"This is an AWESOME movie, real interesting subject matter that keeps you guessing. I don't think I've ever seen Brendan Fraser do a part like this.",1356307200,,147,4.6923076923076925
2687964,2,B000KB48AM,"To be honest, I decided to watch this because I really like Scott Glenn and Brendan Fraser and Mos Def and I enjoy crime thrillers. BUT, I'm sorry I did.  I did NOT like to see them playing these slimy characters - I got no enjoyment from this at all. It's an UGLY story. (Guess ""gritty"" means ""ugly"")

Glenn is an old pimp and club owner in Brazil.  Not sure what he did in the USA but he's not allowed back.  By chance, a very large suitcase full of drugs landed in his lap and gives him the opportunity to leave with his wife and small child to live in a warmer climate and nice area and be able to send his child to college. And his older son from his first marriage (Fraser) will get his club and the whores.  (Fraser could stay and make a living or sell it and return to the states and make a fresh start).

Fraser is his disgusting junkie, gambling low-life son. He is in love with Glenn's wife and her child is actually his.  He is planning to double cross his dad, take all the money from the drug sale and head off somewhere with her and the boy - leaving behind his serious gambling debts and his father.  Not caring if he has to kill his own father to do this, and certainly not caring who else dies in the process.  He is total slime looser scum in this movie, and I really hated seeing him in this role.

Mos Def is a good guy and works as a dishwasher in Glenns club. He kept his nose clean and was going to school to become a bookkeeper. (At least the movie gives us 1 decent person.)

Glenn's intended drug mule for the deal unexpectedly dies of a heart attack while doing a transvestite hooker, and the person the deal is with will ONLY do the deal with someone from his own country, which it turns out Def is.  Glenn presents the situation/opportunity (unthreateningly) to Def and he agrees to it, understanding his cut in the deal would mean he would never have to wash another dish or return to whatever hole he was from.

Overall, I did not appreciate this movie and I would not recommend it.  This had crime and slime but no thrills.  There are better ""crime thriller"" movies out there - better yet, better ways to kill time (or spend your free time ""living"") than on this.

Think I'll go shower and then watch ""Silverado"" and ""With Honors"" to get this residual slime out of my head...",1348012800,,2308,4.223234624145786
2687965,4,B000KB48AM,"Journey to the End of the Night was pretty good for a smaller budget type film.  I would not necessarily call it a low budget film, but not a large budget one either and it's really hard to tell by viewing it since it really does not appear to have a low price tag.  The story was interesting and never got board watching it.  Many of the smaller titled movies like this one that I have seen on Universal HD channel have been really good and better than more expense, popular ones you see in retail/rental stores.  Think in my opinion it says that a large dollar amount does not guarantee a better movie.

2687966,3,B000KB48AM,"""Journey to the End of the Night"" is a crime thriller set in the city of Sao Paulo, starring Brendan Fraser, Mos Def, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Alice Braga and Scott Glenn. The film is about a web of characters affected by a drug deal plan engineered by a brothel owner Sinatra played by Scott Glen. He intends to get out of the place with his young wife Angie (Catalina Sandino Moreno) and 5-year-old son, but his simple plan goes awry when his trusted messenger suddenly dies.

Though his disgruntled son Paul (Brendan Fraser) strongly disagrees, Sinatra chooses Wemba (Mos Def), an immigrant from Nigeria washing dishes in the kitchen, as a new man in charge of the transaction. The fact is, Paul has been contemplating, in his own way, the idea of starting a new life.

You may think ""Journey"" is a multi-layered, intense drama like ""City of God"" (in which Alice Braga also appeared). Actually, Eric Eason-directed thriller is more like a noir with a bit of Greek tragedy set in the underworld of the Brazilian city. (There is one blind soothsayer predicting the future.) Interestingly, according to the internet site IMDb, the film was shot in Brazil, but we don't see the point of setting the plot in Sao Paulo when the story mostly takes place during the night and we can see very little of the city.

The storyline and characters are not very credible, lacking the details and back stories. The story has certainly twists and turns, as well as actions, but they are not thrilling when the plot is full of holes and incredible decisions on the side of main characters.

Actors are doing their best and Brendan Fraser delivers strong acting as the desperate anti-hero, but his fans may not like the character he plays. The most impressive is Mos Def, who quietly steals every scene he is in. Otherwise, ""Journey to the End of the Night"" remains mildly interesting crime thriller.",1267920000,,1884,4.734756097560975

2687968,4,B000KB48AM,"Even thought I have never heard of this movie,I just happened to find it when I was in the video Store and then I bought it. This movie a dark movie, fascinating, well acted, and well scripted. Mos Def's character is excellently performed, and Brendan Fraser played a character which is very uncharteristic of his other roles. You will be surprised!",1176163200,4,349,4.737704918032787
2687969,3,B000KB48AM,"For those of us who found much to admire and appreciate in Eric Eason's 2002 little powerhouse of a film MANITO that placed Franky G in the limelight as a sound actor inside that hunky exterior, the release of JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT held much promise.  Unfortunately with  moving into the arena of 'major features' with popular big actors in a script that is deeply in need of surgery proves a step too quickly taken.  While it is easy to see Eason's intentions in this very dark (literally!) film, it is compulsively doctored with phony 'reality ideas' that misfire.

The basic story is a family of Americans who are deeply involved in the crime scene (brothels) of So Paulo, Brazil, intricately bound in their crime acts but both planning to escape the quagmire of the dingy life of the city and return to America.  The father Sinatra (Scott Glenn) is living with Angie (Catalina Sandino Moreno - the star of 'Maria Full of Grace') and they have a small child: Sinatra's son Paul (Brendan Fraser) is also in love with Angie and plans an escape from the dregs of Sao Paulo after he manages to work a drug pass engineered by his father. The sale is to Nigerians who speak Yoruba and when the 'messenger' meant to pass the drugs for the money abruptly dies in a brothel with a transgender prostitute, the panic begins: who can make the pass that night? Sinatra hires a Nigerian, Yoruba speaking dishwasher Wemba (Mos Def) who agrees to take the drugs to the drop site and it seems Wemba is the only decent character to keep his bargain and his word.  Paul is enraged with the death of the original middleman and ends up disfiguring the prostitute present at his death.  The drug deal falls into problems, Paul is unable to convince Angie to stand by him (which mean leaving Paul's father and the possible endangerment of her son), and things bog down plot-wise so that story ultimately ends with the only persons to care about are Angie and Wemba.

Eason makes his story all happen in one night and the constant factor is a greenish darkness that hides almost everything - and that may be a good thing!  The script is Swiss cheese, the acting is for the most part sadly directed, the cast is poorly chosen, and the only real redeeming factor is the chance to watch Mos Def continue to flesh out his career with well executed character roles.  Eric Eason holds much promise as a director (he was the awarded best emerging filmmaker by first annual Tribeca Film Festival in New York City in 2002), so perhaps this excursion into the 'big screen realm' can be forgiven as overstepping his material.  In the end JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT is hopefully just a sidestep for a director who obviously has considerable talent.  Grady Harp, March 07",1172880000,8,2752,4.571138211382114
2687970,4,B000KB48AM,"This won't be everyone's bag, but it's set in the gritty and visually interesting Sao Paulo and is pretty riveting through out.  The plot is a bit serpentine and perhaps a bit overly ambitious, but there are some pretty good performances and nice suspense.  Mos Def in particular is very effective in his role; he continues to give interesting and challenging performances establishing himself as a reliable actor.  Brendan Fraser plays against type and does a decent job as a drugged out on-the-edge criminal looking to escape the Brazilian underworld.  Gritty, very grim, but entertaining and for the most part, well done.",1170547200,23,624,5.088235294117647

If you read the description of this movie you have probably got the best parts of the show. It is like taking all the parts, dumping them into a glass, shaking them up and rolling them out on a table to figure out. Except there is no need to figure anything out. What you see is what you get. It took me several painful tries to get through the whole thing. And that was a complete waste of time. Sullen and black and I think they were hoping for suspense and instead someone murdered the plot before the movie started. It is very disjointed and instead of giving you some basic information they assume you already know it and before you can figure anything out people start dropping like flies. It is not worth paying for. That's is my opinion for what it's worth.",1366675200,,906,4.153409090909091
