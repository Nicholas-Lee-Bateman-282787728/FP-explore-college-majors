8472730,5,B005H7NNS2,"I'm torn as I review this ""street doc"" about Philly street tycoon Alton ""Ace Capone"" Coles.  Half of me knows that it was against the code for Ace to be as flamboyant as he was with his wealth and lifestyle.  But the other half hates the way a fictional movie that he produced for his record label was used in the case against him to put him behind bars (for life plus 55 years,(!).  I suggest you purchase this one and see how you feel.  There is also a bonus interview with Ace from behind the wall.",1406419200,,501,4.134020618556701
