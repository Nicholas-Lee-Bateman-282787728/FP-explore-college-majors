8098789,5,B000CFG7T6,"While I don't remember laughing out loud at this film I do remember the feel good mood at the end of it. If you are familiar with French farces you will know how this plot will run. Lots of comic situations, secret pasts and misunderstandings. Everything is in this and it all works seamlessly. One character leaves the scene and others enter and it goes on and on. Very fast moving and an enjoyable evening.",1396224000,,408,4.453333333333333
8098790,4,B000CFG7T6,"Adolescence is a difficult age. Everyone knows that. But is it mainly problematic because teenagers rebel against their parents? Or is it the sexual awakening which makes progenitors uneasy?  ""Crustacs & Coquillages"" revisits these questions in a story about love, self-discovery and vacations.

A family owns a beach house in the Cote D'Azur so they decide to spend the summer there. As they arrive, their son Charly receives the visit of his best friend Martin. As the days go by, Beatrix, Charly's mother, comes to a conclusion: the two kids are gay and are currently a couple. However Marc, the father, angrily refuses to accept this possibility.

Why is Charly's father such a paramount character here? Because the name of the father is the only thing that prevents a boy from turning gay. When Jacques Lacan defined the meaning of the `nom de pre' he relied on a French word game. The `nom de pre' is the name of the father but is also the No of the father. According to Lacanian theory it doesn't matter if a child is raised without fatherly figures as long as the mother invokes the name of the father, which ultimately is the origin of the tribal law, the social indictment; and it is so because the name of the father is also the definitive negative. When the child asks `why not' the father can always answer `because'. As tautological as it may sound, is the father who attributes himself the final word. And when there is no father then the mother must reenact this dynamic by conferring upon her the authority derived from the father. More traditional psychoanalysis would suggest that a child raised without a father could be prone to feminization (isn't it a common place to say that gays act like women?); Lacan proposes that as long as the `nom de pre' is imprinted upon the mind of the child then the risk of becoming homosexual would be thus ruled out.

But what happens when it is precisely that risk what worries Marc the most? Beatrix seems perfectly fine with having a gay son, while Marc is about to lose his temper. What they completely ignore is that Charly is, in fact, straight, although his friend Martin is gay. Certainly, this doesn't seclude the youngsters from behaving oddly at times. For instance, when Charly announces to his friend that he is going to masturbate in the shower, the viewer sees Martin unbuttoning his short and placing his hand down his underwear. Is it enticing for Martin to imagine what his friend is doing in the shower? Can he come to an orgasm while picturing his best friend? Certainly, the best alternative is to stop cold turkey, which is what Martin does. This moment mirrors a previous scene in which Charly gets caught by his mother. As one can easily comprehend, masturbation is always interrupted. Perhaps, as Michel Foucault wrote in in Histoire de la Sexualit, puritan minds can barely stand the idea of masturbation, but the possibility of fantasizing to fuel masturbatory acts is even more despicable. And that's exactly what masturbation is all about. As Foucault explained, masturbation is not possible without fantasy. Fantasy must be there, either in the form of a sexualized other or in any other way that could be sexually stimulant. To put it simply, one does not wildly masturbate reading the phone book.

Charly is a bit shy and his lack of success with girls get him frustrated at times. It is then when he suggests a ""jerking-off"" contest with Martin and they quarrel about it. Perhaps in the heterosexual mindset, such games or practices would be deprived of any further meaning, nevertheless what is clear to the viewer is that Martin has no intentions of jeopardizing this friendship by indulging in mutual sexual stimulation. It's clear that an unresolved sexual tension erects a barrier among the two boys, to the point that Charly asks Martin bluntly if he thinks of him while masturbating.

But one cannot cover this topic enough. As Martin successfully finishes pleasuring himself in the shower, he is accidentally observed by Marc, who immediately recurs to his wife to have sex with an energy that had apparently disappeared over the course of the years. After going cruising, Martin is beset and out of confusion tries to hit Marc. Marc, as a good father, calms him down and they both end up sleeping in the same bed. The morning after, Marc wakes up, goes into the shower and starts stroking his penis vigorously. What is the meaning of all this? What does Marc represent truly as a fatherly figure?

More importantly if, according to psychoanalytic theory, Marc is in a sexually confused state of mind, can he still function as the fatherly figure? Perhaps one might wonder then, what it is that Charly rebels against? It has been made clear by Freud that every son must kill his father to have carnal commerce with the mother (this is all symbolic, of course), but what would occur if the father cannot represent a rivalry for the love of the mother? What then? Charly's Oedipus complex is not at as easy as one could have ventured at first. We are not in front of a typical teenager fending off in a ""normal"" family. Why, here even Beatrix has her own secrets.

One thing is worth noting, though, like every other teen, Charly must first figure out what it is he wants, and for that he must redefine his relationships with the rest of the world, namely, with his father and his best friend. Without spoiling the end I can only say that in the same way fantasy is indispensable for masturbation, fantasy will also be the key to come up with a suitable solution for everyone.",1317686400,,5571,4.724279835390947
