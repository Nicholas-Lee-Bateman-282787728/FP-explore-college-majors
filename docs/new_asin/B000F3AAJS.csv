Things get scary for her when someone shows up wanting success in her love life. The scary part is that her new client has a crush on the boy she likes. Yurie and her friends get a break and go to the beach for fun, but it's not all fun and games when they get there. Yurie's cat also gets into a dispute with the local kitties and the townspeople. These things seem trivial and day to day, but for a tender hearted young girl it can be stressful.

This volume is good. Th episodes are fun, and the characters get more development. I think I like the 1st DVD better, but I like the series more after watching this DVD. That may not make a lot of sense, but I think that the show is starting to grow on me a bit. This is a great series for all ages. It's very calm and even paced. I like the animation, voice actors, and soundtrack. Overall, Kamichu is a lot of fun. It's a relaxing way to escape from the mundane everyday life that we all live with. I recommend it to all anime fans over the age of 11, especially girls. It keeps getting better as it goes on.",1356912000,,1202,4.071729957805907

The episodes still have the same slow pacing, but the story has the amazing ability to capture and hold your attention the whole way through.  If you want something light-hearted then you definitely want to pick this up.  It's worth it, really.",1162684800,3,410,4.5
