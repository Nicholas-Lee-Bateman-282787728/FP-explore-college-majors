I love her voice, the way she carries herself, the way that she balances her speaking presentations with a juicy amount of material, personal journal entries, and scripture.  I have the CD version of this (have others of Kathy's teaching presentations on DVD) and I have listened to it twice already.

i find her so soothing, and so real.  She doesn't get up there and preach perfection, she teaches us how to find Christ right where we are....and reassures us that where we are is okay.  Kathy is very open about her own struggles, which makes her very likeable and easy to relate to as a speaker.  I may decide to pick this one up on DVD as well so I can have the video and not just audio.

If you enjoyed Kathy's book Live Like You Mean It, you'll enjoy this.

Make sure you listen for the Applebee's story - it's so good!  Won't give it away here, but it will definitely make you smile.",1373587200,,933,4.316091954022989
8373586,5,B002M5XLZ2,"Incredible!  Best video series our women's ministry has ever used!  Everyone raved about how much they gleaned from each lesson. Wish it had a study guide to go with it but it was seriously amazing as is.  Other women ministries dvds are soooo expensive and honestly, we all agreed not nearly as effective/beneficial at Kathy's. Wish we could get more like these from her.  You will not be disappointed.",1325635200,,403,4.797101449275362
