5370121,5,B009WBLIFO,"I've had the pleasure of seeing each of these short films separately.  I've been anxiously waiting on their release and was overjoyed to see that they are being released in a compilation. These short films will have you ooo-ing and ahhh-ing, talking to the screen and talking to the characters. And then hitting rewind so that you can do it again! Each one is magnificent on it's own. BUT TOGETHER......this is POWERFUL!  This DVD is a must own.  You WILL watch it over and over and over....",1351123200,5,491,4.620689655172414
8544655,3,B009WBLIFO,The movie was just ok.  I was bored and it was cheap so I watched it. It wasn't the best movie I seen nor was it the worst.,1392768000,,123,3.392857142857143
8544656,2,B009WBLIFO,"Can we please watch a dvd that is not full of adultery, fornication? Can we watch something with good morals, or have we forgotten about it, or sold ourselves to the devil? Come on people, we are in the last days. We see adultery all the time on tv. We are human, and yes, we do get tempted, but can we see some resistance in a movie for once? One night stand! I can't see any woman laying up with a man that is not her husband, and she gets pregnant after one night. A dog gone shame. Respect yourself my sisters and say no more! I will not be watching this dvd anymore after I have already watched it once. I will either throw it away, or give it to the goodwill. I haven't decided. I would not buy this dvd.",1388188800,,710,4.007042253521127
8544657,5,B009WBLIFO,Obviously football isn't the only thing Terrell Suggs excels in. These shorts are well made and left me wanting more! Bring on the next ones Terrell!,1369353600,,149,4.769230769230769
8544658,4,B009WBLIFO,"I absolutely enjoyed these short films, I just wish they were longer so the story line could play out more.",1363132800,,107,4.4
8544659,5,B009WBLIFO,"I received my copy in the mail just a few days after ordering it, and my friend and I were glued to the screen for the next hour or so! The stories are intriguing, the characters are multi-faceted and the editing was superb! My friend and I were hooked into each film, and actually got into an argument over a few of the character's actions (whether they were right or not).... that's how invested we were in the way the stories played out. What's more, the photography and the music were well thought-out and incorporated into the drama.

I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but I will say my absolute favorite film is When Beautiful People Do Ugly Things -- we had to rewind the end scene just to shout and root the main character on one more time. lol. If these short stories are the example of what we can expect from these directors (and everyone else involved in their creation) then I can't wait to partake in their feature films! Would definitely recommend it ^_^",1356825600,,978,4.4636871508379885
8544660,5,B009WBLIFO,"I enjoy watching films probably a bit more than the average person, but I haven't seen many short films.  Curiosity about the form, which I usually only consider during Oscar season. drove me to make this purchase.  I was not disappointed!  Each film was well-written and created sympathetic characters that left me wanting more.  ""Sisters"", while just a conversation between two half-sisters over an abbreviated dinner, was multi-layered and complex. I can understand why it won Best Short Film at the 2010 International Black Film Festival.  So much was communicated in a short amount of time yet seemed completely natural.  In ""Marco Polo"", I wanted to connect with the main character (Dr. Ann Christman) because marriage is difficult; but her husband was so sweet--I can't believe the movie ended the way it did!  I wanted it to continue just to see the jerky boyfriend get what he deserved...""Commitment"" left me with so many questions and again left me wanting more.  ""When Beautiful People Do Ugly Things"" told such a complete story in a short amount of time, again with characters that were sympathetic and engaging.  It's difficult to tell with (most) of these stories who to root for because the characters are three-dimensional.  Kudos to the writing and acting, as well as the editing and soundtrack which helped to convey a lot of the meaning and keep the viewer engaged. I highly recommend this DVD.  It's entertaining and thought-provoking and it's inspired me to look around for more short films, too.",1356652800,,1517,5.00398406374502
8544661,5,B009WBLIFO,"If you have an opportunity and the time, please watch this.  This is what good stories look like and this is how stories are supposed to be told.  Looking forward to seeing the other items by Team Sizzle.  Great work!!",1355443200,,218,4.4
8544662,4,B009WBLIFO,This compilation of movies was very entertaining and they left me wanting more. I have to say that Commitment left me a little confused but I think that may have been the intention. Overall good job Team Sizzle!,1354492800,,211,4.578947368421052
8544663,5,B009WBLIFO,I have been waiting to see these films with bated breath. I am happy to say it was worth the wait. The characters are interesting and well developed. The story lines are all engaging and leaving you wanting more. The cinematography is also excellent. I look forward to seeing more projects from this director.,1353196800,,309,4.7407407407407405
8544664,5,B009WBLIFO,"I received my copy the other day in the mail and watched them all last night. Thoroughly enjoyed Sisters, Marco Polo and When Beautiful People do Ugly Things. Absolutely Wonderful. I only wished they were longer. They ended too soon. :-) I had never seen or heard about Commitment until last night. It was very intriguing. The story lines, the music, the acting, the production, everything was just very well done. I can't wait to see what Team Sizzle has for us next. It's very captivating. Get your copy, you won't regret it.",1352419200,3,527,4.67741935483871
