Looking forward to the MDF disc!",1427932800,,114,5.052631578947368
8607559,5,B00EON8T8E,Saw these guys a few years ago in Brooklyn and wanted to be able to relive the whole thing. And it didn't disapoint. Two discs Tokyo show and death feast how can you go wrong. Would have been cool if it had some interview stuff but what the hell it's still grate. If you haven't seen them get this. Or if you have and are like me and want to relive it get this.  It's just grate rock fury.,1402876800,2,389,3.9240506329113924
8607560,5,B00EON8T8E,"That bonus dvd set at MDF in '12?  That's me with the the beard and long black hair making up the swirling mush that was the push to the front for this performance.  Very very fun set that i just had to have this DVD, and frankly you should too if you were at the MDF performance.  The full set in home turf?  Yeah that's just the icing on the cake.",1383350400,,349,3.8732394366197185
