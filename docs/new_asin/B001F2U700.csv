3562649,4,B001F2U700,"The longest and most savage arc of the ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" series comes to an end.... just in time for our heroes to get blindsided by a brand new threat to the world. Ah, fun.

In fact, the third season of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" is pretty much packed with entertainment. While the end of the Dark Tournament Arc is all hardcore, bloody action and quite a bit of pathos, the story that follows is even darker and more twisted -- although thankfully still tinged with a sense of humour. If only Yusuke's final duel with Toguro hadn't dragged out so long, this collection would have been ideal.

Kurama barely triumphs in his duel with Karasu, until a replay reveals that he lost the point anyway. So it falls to Hiei to fight the monstrously powerful Bui with his newly retrained Dragon of the Darkness Flame, shattering the stadium and threatening to destroy everyone around him. And Kuwabara goes up against the grotesque, unkillable Elder Toguro -- who drives him into a rage with the revelation of Genkai's death.

Then there's the duel everyone's been waiting for -- Yusuke and Younger Toguro. And though Yusuke's training has given him immense new powers, he still can't beat his demonic opponent. But then a familiar voice tells Toguro the secret to unlocking Yusuke's power -- kill one of his friends. And when Toguro seemingly murders a helpless Kuwabara, Yusuke's rage and grief cause his power to skyrocket -- but will it be enough to defeat Toguro's 100%?

Then there's the aftermath of the battle. The team thinks back on the person they all miss, and in the Spirit World, Genkai has an encounter with Toguro -- revealing his true motives.

But no sooner have the teammates returned home than Yusuke is kidnapped by a trio of teenage psychics, who are keeping him in the bizarre House of Four Dimensions. His friends undergo a series of trials to get to him, only to learn the true purpose of this exercise -- someone is forming a vast tunnel to the demon plane, which could unleash tanker-sized demons in less than a month. Yusuke and friends must stop the mastermind behind this -- but they must also deal with a squad of extremely lethal psychics...

The ending of the Dark Tournament is a pretty solid one -- lots of fiery black dragons, dismemberment, Toguro's gross green muscles, and a stadium that finally collapses. It's quite a credit that after dozens of fight scenes, this series still manages to amp up the voltage for the final round of fights, and delivers a few shocking twists along the way.

The big problems: a certain dead character fails to stay that way, and Toguro and Yusuke's battle is kind of anticlimactic after Hiei's literally earthshattering duel and Kuwabara's inspired attack on elder Toguro. Ah, well. You can't have it all.
But things really heat up in the beginning of the next arc. It starts off on a rather lighthearted note (""I'd rather not explain to your teacher why I can fly"")), but once the whole Tunnel-to-Demon-World plot is revealed, things take a darker turn. We're treated to some truly gruesome fight scenes, such as that of the mad doctor who uses his ""territory"" to poison hundreds of people at once. And it's packed with secrets and mysteries, particularly about the new bad guy.

And fortunately the stories are still liberally speckled with humor, including Kuwabara's victory dance and Hiei's tumble out of a tree (""What repulsive creature makes my ears bleed?!""). But the most hilarious scene involves the composed, dignified Kurama screaming ""BAAAAAAAAA!"" behind a jealous classmate, and pulling a funny face.

Yusuke has a lot of growth in this season, and not all of it is good -- sometimes he seems deeply overconfident and rather obnoxious, but he also shows a great deal of caring for his friends. And in one harrowing episode he is forced to kill another human to save others, which is little comfort to the young Spirit Detective. I'm not sure why killing humans is any different from killing demons, though.

And Kurama gets to show his intellect in a series of psychological games with a snotty psychic classmate, while Hiei turns out to have plenty of power and the ""abandon"" to use it, but also an ill-used ego to match. And Kuwabara again proves that he's a lot cleverer than he looks, giving Yusuke the final push to victory and helping charge through the House of Four Dimensions.

Poor Yusuke and friends. They never get a break of more than two or three days before another disaster pops up like a toadstool. And the third season of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" is definitely no exception.",1220140800,12,4550,4.739570164348925

3562688,5,B001F2U700,"Yu Yu Hakusho season 3! More villians and fighting and more action! Here is my review, please enjoy!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers) The Dark Tournament ended and every returns home after the second disc (will explain more down below). Weeks later a new threat arives. Koenma gets reports that strange activites are happening in the human realm. Little tiny bugs are invading and making people go crazy and killing others. Meanwhile on earth Yusuke is going to school more. One day after school he is confronted by some boys who have new and strange psychic abilities. After finding out what they want Koenma comes to tell the entire gang that the most powerful and evil video tape in the world called Chapter Black has been stolen and that someone is creating a portal to demon world, a portal so large that any size demon no matter how powerful, good or evil is coming to earth world. Chapter Black is a video tape showing the most evil things in humanity that humans have ever done, its said to who ever see's turns evil and will want to destroy all humanity. Now Yusuke and the gang must stop this new threat and save earth realm from demons and ghost again!

Pros: This is a pretty intense season and story arc. This is 100% UNCUT and UNCENSORED so you get all the action, blood, fighting and swearing the show has. The voice acting is amazing, the music works. Comes with 4 discs containing episodes 54 to 84

Cons: The casing like all the other caseings to me (and maybe just to me) feels cheap. Another thing I felt was that after the Dark Tournament ended super the story was there but it just never got as deep as it was

Episodes Cons: above if you remember I said ""The Dark Tournament ended and every returns home after the second disc (will explain more down below).""  Now is the explination is that the 1st two discs of season 3 here are still on the Dark Tournament (aka DT) where episode 54 starts with the begining of the final round in the DT and ends with episode 66, episode 67 starts the Chapter Black Saga. So honestly you only get half of the Chapter Black saga chapter the way how Funimation put the episodes on discs.

Over all: If you get over the whole episode cons I listed above this is still a super series to watch! Its very amazing! Buy this series!!!",1454803200,2,2290,4.4534606205250595

It seems like each saga gets better and better. Each saga is great in its own way, but the Chapter Black Saga saga deals with some strong dark serious issues and not only that, but it leaves you wondering what will happen next and will Yu Yu Hakusho be able to save his world in time. All the characters are great and still going strong in this saga, and the new villian is not bad his self.

3562750,4,B001F2U700,"The Dark Tournament continues and it indeed has lived up to its name. The matches were no doubt death filled and full of carnage. And now Yusuke's team has already begun a vicious battle with Team Toguro, that will only end when one team is standing and the other either beaten or dead. -summary

 Season Three contains episodes 57 - 84, and it completely wraps up the Dark Tournament Saga. This saga had its ups and downs, and there were moments when I wanted to hit the fast forward button. On some occasions the action scenes began to drag and felt as if they were going nowhere. And various times it felt that way towards the climax. Thankfully, the good outweighed the bad and the Dark Tournament Saga finished with a bang.

 Things kicked off with Hiei taking on the armored juggernaut of Team Toguro named Bui. This scene followed up Kurama's battle very well keeping the interest level pretty much at its peak. Not too soon afterwards, the long-awaited confrontation between Yusuke and the younger Toguro brother begins. This is indeed an epic battle, and the aftermath added the necessary touch to close off this chapter.

 The only real issue I have with this story arc is that the ghosts of Dragon Ball Z pop up, which is something that would go on to be a staple in this type of anime, and has carried over into series such as Bleach. Characters would die dramatic deaths only to be brought back to life later on with the weakest explanations behind them. If it wasn't for the reason that this one particular character would see some type of real use later on, then it would come off looking very cheap and just weaken the series.

 The Dark Tournament Saga flows into, what I think to be, the best story arc in the series called The Chapter Black Saga. Yusuke develops a feel as if he has done it all with the defeat of Toguro. Only to learn that there's actually a rating class on the power of the demons he faces. He learns that Toguro ranks as a high level class B, which is nowhere near the strongest at all. There are two other higher ranking classes being A, and the S class being the highest. Sensui, a Spirit Detective gone rogue, plans to break the barrier protecting the human world from the demon world, unleashing the demons onto the Earth. This means the entire Earth would be invaded by hordes of B class demons and above. The thought of fighting an army of Toguro's is more than enough to send everyone into a panic.

 I think this story is by far the best written. The main characters are still interesting, but it's the villains that stands out the most. Sensui has assembled a team of human psychics with some very interesting powers, with one being a doctor who uses his knowledge on medicine to not only create a flying plague, but also uses his surgical skills in battle with is real creative and awesome. Along with another one named Sniper, who can turn anything into a lethal weapon, such as almost piercing someone's skull with a pencil eraser from 500 yards away. The villains are pretty well written and there is some good development to take place with them. I also have to mention the sudden change in tone to the morbid. This saga is by far the darkest when looking at the cruelty of Sensui's men. The story also plays on the heroes morality by putting them in a position where they may have no choice but to take a human life. This is a plot device that could have been used better, but it also hampers the story in ways too. I won't spoil it, but it could have been done better.

 Visually the series sees some improvement. There are moments when the visuals are darker with less lighting to reflect the personality of the story. It does work in creating some creepy like moments. The action scenes are slightly better and there's a bit more blood spewing than usual. My take on the BGM and voice acting remains the same completely. I will point out that there are moments when the sound effects stood out to me, with the heavy metallic sounds of Bui's armored footsteps sounding really cool.

 Season Three starts and ends very strong and continues into the fourth season. This saga is definitely the best to me since it actually tells a story and has several suspense-filled moments. If you enjoyed the first two seasons, then I see nothing wrong with coming into this one with higher expectations.

Pros: Solid story, plot, and better animation

Cons: Some weaker moments here and there",1413590400,,4434,4.5306633291614515

3562775,5,B001F2U700,"One of the first anime I've ever watched, and it's still my favorite.
This show has the type of characters that work so well off each other that they seem real. While they were based off certain tropes, they really evolve as characters throughout the series, and it's an extreme pleasure to watch them grow in inner and outer strength.
This season wraps up the Tournament saga and begins the next saga, in which a Spirit Detective from the past comes to reek havoc. If you have the other two seasons, make sure this one's on your shelf.",1386115200,,536,4.479591836734694
3562776,2,B001F2U700,"Season three aka The Chapter Black Saga of Yu Yu Hakusho is a 4 disc box set released by Funimation. Loved the slimness of the cases (I remember the bulkiness of the original DVD release of the YYH series although I do not know if Chapter Black had been released then). I adore the creepy rock music in the DVD menu. I wish I knew who did it!

Thing is, Funimation branded this as 'season 3' but really it is not. The first disc starts out with the last couple episodes of season 2 aka the Dark Tournament Saga and on disc 4, the last episode is about 10 episodes off from the finale of season 3. Wow. Just wow. How that is the entire Chapter Black saga I have no clue. Marketing genius or fail, I have no clue.

Chapter Black is not my favorite so far of the arcs in YYH. It's chaotic, there's too many side characters to keep track of, and a lot of people keep 'revealing' things that is supposed to be shocking to the audience but really it just seems that the creator, like a lot of creators, had to think of a quick reason for something from the past to have happened so ten characters withholding information is the way to fix that. The messiness of the Chapter Black saga is to be expected after the wonderful Dark Tournament arc. It is a hard act to follow and the creator was probably pressured into writing/drawing something more amazing and came up with this (a former, rogue spirit detective that Koenma never mentioned and an oh so scary video tape that holds the horrors of mankind).

Disappointing all around.",1383868800,2,1524,4.340350877192982

Each disc plays for over 2 hours, this series has an awesome mix of action drama, comedy, and a bit of romance. Yusuke Urameshi is the notorious but lovable wise acre, and fighter, he is joined by his friends Kuwabara, two demons Kurama, Heie, and others, together they are an awesome team. The Yu Yu Hakusho series has action from start to finish, I also bought seasons 1, 2 and 4 from another seller ( The cd exchange ) I am very happy and will be glued to the tv watching it for a few days",1318464000,,633,4.283333333333333

3562837,5,B001F2U700,"I originally saw this DVD and the other three of the series available for $30.00.  I have always enjoyed this series and had been looking to buy it for quite some time.  When I saw that it was available for less than half the original price, I knew I couldn't pass on that.

I bought it, and within a week it was at my house, in perfect condition.

As to the series:  Absolutely amazing!  The only thing I find kind of annoying is that there isn't a lot of Extras available of the DVD.  I do like that you can see individual episodes, and the art both on the covers and inside the cases is absolute amazing!  The cases the DVDs come in are paper-thin, and probably easy to tear, but I'm always careful, so I don't forsee an issue here.

I highly recommend this series!",1311984000,,768,4.205479452054795

3562850,4,B001F2U700,"I bought the whole series of Yu Yu Hakusho because it is a solid anime show. It starts a bit slow introducing all the characters and personalities but once it hit episode 10 it really starts to take off. I'm not a big anime guy and I've been watching this show since I was younger when it was on tv so if your into the anime that is targeted towards teens then your golden, if not this may not be the show for you",1285372800,,413,3.9285714285714284
3562851,4,B001F2U700,"Yu Yu Hakusho is a classic series of which I've been a fan of since I was a little girl, and a long series at that, so I was ecstatic to find the complete series. I won't review the series here (there's a wiki page for it and plenty of online reviews for the show itself), just the box set.

Packaging:
Overall, I would have preferred a single box set, but considering the series length, the four sets take up very little shelf space. Each season is two thinpaks (each containing two discs) in a slim, thin box. Honestly, I wish the box covers were a bit thicker and sturdier, these will tear and show wear quite easily I'm afraid. Each season has a different character theme for the box and thinpaks, Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, etc, and character themes for set of menus on the dvd's. Every inch of the box sets are covered in nice art, from beautiful line art on the inside of the thinpaks to colorful group artwork on the covers; the only undecorated space is the dvd's themselves, which are white with minor detail, but it's a nice bit of symmetry and simplicity to contrast the rest of the detailed and colorful packaging.

Dvd's:
The dvd's themselves are fairly simple; the sound and picture quality is excellent in both English and Japanese, and there are two sets of English subtitles -one that matches the English dub and one that is a direct translation of the Japanese, and both are in small, white unobtrusive font which is nice in that they don't clutter up the screen but is harder to read. The special features are nothing special; usually just trailers for other anime or one-paragraph character profiles. The main menu has no fancy video intro but it does have a really awesome rock-theme that plays in the background. Still, it would have been nice to have different music for different menus, as YYH sports a varied and catchy arsenal of themes.

Another nitpick is the weird cutting off points for the seasons - the Dark Tournament Ark starts in box-set one and ends in box-set three, and considering the number of Dark Tournament Arc episodes on box-sets one and three it would have been easy to fit them on the dvd's for box-set two, or add one more thinpak. I would not have minded even a slimmer (and by extension cheaper) fourth and final box set (The Three Kings Arc is under twenty episodes) if it meant each box-set would truly only contain one season each. This is a minor, organizational complaint, though. It only really becomes an annoyance if you were to go looking for a particular episode to re-watch and it turned out to not be in the box-set you expected because it was tacked on to the beginning of the box-set after or the ending of the box-set before.

In conclusion, it's a great value for the money simply due to the series size, and everything is done well, but it would have been nice to see the distributors go the extra mile and splurge on thicker packaging, consistency in the art and better special features. I'm satisfied with these four box sets but if a more complete single box set comes out I'll be the first to sell these and buy that. If you are already a fan of the series I recommend picking these up, but if you just want to test it out I'd recommend you find another way to watch a few episodes (funimation sometimes offers free streaming of their anime on their website) and see if you genuinely like it before you lay your cash down, as these won't have great resale value if it turns out it's not your thing.

A satisfactory job, but not an exceptional one. 3.5/5 stars, which for convenience I'll round up.

EDIT: Also, be careful when putting the dvd's back in to secure them firmly; they tend to fall out of their places a lot easier than other thinpaks I have had, my season 2 box-set in fact had one loose dvd.  Not a deal-breaker, you just have to make sure they are secure instead of just throwing them in all willy nilly.",1284508800,,3890,4.470422535211267

3562857,5,B001F2U700,"The season 3 box set starts off with the remainder of the Dark Tournament as Hiei has an extremely destructive and entertaining battle with the powerful Bui. Then Kuwabara has a rather strange fight with ELder Toguro with Kuwabara defeating him in a very improvised way. Then comes the final duel between Spirit Detective Yusuke Urameshi and his Demon nemesis Younger Toguro who gives Yusuke the fight of his life. The battle is raw and violent however finishing in a quiet graceful manner. After Toguro is defeated everyone resumes their usual lives but Yusuke is then taken hostage by 3 teenagers with strange psychic abilities, this however was just friendly training as a new threat emerges that has been hiding in the shadows for some time. A group of 7 psychics wants to bring in the age of Apocalypse for the human race and have demons storm the living world in mass through a permanent tunnel connecting the two worlds. The leader of this movement is former Spirit Detective Shinobu Sensui who has gone renegade. Despite Yusuke's immense power Sensui renders Yusuke completely useless and outclassed with Sensui powering up to S class beyond anything Spirit World can handle and mere minutes from having a stable tunel into the  demon world. Yusuke will also have to face death a second time as the fallen hero claims his life in battle and his friends although powered with motivation have little chance to even survive an encounter with the renegade spirit detective......All in all the final of the dark tournament is very entertaining and fun to watch to top that off you are introduced to the most viscious of all the villains in YuYuHakusho (Never satisfied Never full They eat with grubby hands until nothing is left but piss)-Shinobu Sensui who gives the YYH gang the worst beating of their lives and then some. The Chapterblack saga is without question the best of all the sagas and you get to see it begin here.",1228521600,,1929,4.8102409638554215

8300737,5,B001F2U700,"All the disks work perfectly. The stakes have gotten higher for our heroes. And the hardest part is you can understand why the depraved antagonist Sensui is doing what he plans to do. And why Hiei wouldn't blame him much.
