8753468,5,B01CO0LXNQ,"I have enjoyed all of the series even though the main characters have changed over the years. It gripes me that the final series is not apparently going to be released in the US format. I haven't been able to get it but since I am considering getting a region less DVD player, this may not be a problem. I cannot seem to find the code to re-set my old Magnavox player to play other regions.",1514764800,2,390,4.144736842105263
8753469,2,B01CO0LXNQ,"I'm a huge fan of the first season of Wolfblood - it's a classic. Season 2 was good and season 3 was losing it's energy. I was excited to try season 4 since I think Leona Vaughan has a good screen presence and isn't one of the cookie cutter type actors films and series are full of. I bought it for Ms. Vaughan and she does a good job - as much as she is allowed to. The supporting characters are terrible, they hog the scenes and I think totally ruin any sense of drama, action or suspense. I don't like to give 2 stars to anything, but after the production staff viewed the first episode they should have seen the terrible mess they were making.",1511308800,,647,4.142857142857143
