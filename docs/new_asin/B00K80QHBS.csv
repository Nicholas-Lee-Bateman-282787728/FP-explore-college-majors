6405127,4,B00K80QHBS,"A fantastic comedy and a wonderful mix of drama also.

TLA Releasing has brought this wonderful film out on DVD. TLA always knows how to give an outlet of wonderful films to the public and Big Gay Love is a perfect example of the art-form they spread to the community of film.

I found this film to be truly entertaining and very comical and also in a sense beautiful in the concept of love. I think what makes this movie shine is not only the wonderful performances by everyone, but its the ultimate truth of the story. Love is not about color, shape or size. This showcases Bob. A young gay man living in L.A. He doesnt have a boyfriend and thinks its his image that turns people away. Bob is not the smooth, ripped muscular body image that displays itselfs throughout the image obsessed Hollywood and gay and straight reality.

The problem with the gay and even straight community is the idea of image. Being gay is not about six pack abs, toned body and muscular form. So many in the gay community suffer right along with what young teenage girls suffer through, the identity of image. They strive to look like the model on the magazine and so the gay community also tries to push and bombard with image after image of slick, toned beautiful people. I am not saying its wrong to look like that, I am just saying there is a bigger community of gay people that look, average and live there live's, not with green garden shakes and weights. I think that is the beautiful reality of this movie is Bob is your average person. Bob longs for a relationship. And when he finds one he thinks because of what he looks like, no one will have him and so he goes about trying to change himself, not for who he is, but for what other people say and push and cloud logic with the form of image. Basically put, his own reality and self esteem built by the concept of what image has done to the reality of what is beautiful. He sees himself as not lovable.

6405128,4,B00K80QHBS,"I enjoyed this film, but I do feel that there were too many gay stereotypes perpetuated.  I also feel that the overall message of the film kinda' got lost in the execution.  The message seems to be that an intelligent, grounded hunk like Andy really could fall for someone like Bob who is overweight and average-looking because beauty lies within, right?  Okay, that works, but what makes the pairing of Andy and Bob so far-fetched is that a self-confident guy like Andy could fall for someone as whiny, self-loathing, and just plain annoying as Bob...regardless of Bob's physical appearance.  I totally buy into the idea that one's real beauty is inside, but from my point of view, the character of Bob was lacking both inside and out.",1423526400,5,736,4.771653543307087

6405130,4,B00K80QHBS,"Why do I like this movie?  This is a movie about romantic love, yet it has some drama in it.  Not one for the Oscars, but definitely for the heart.  It shows some of the gay stereotypes and Nicholas does a great job playing a gay man and those were real kisses. I enjoyed seeing the two main characters becoming involved, I wished it was longer.  It is a great short film and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to laugh and cry and is open to see themselves in this movie.  I had a great Movie night.",1421971200,,507,4.03
6405131,4,B00K80QHBS,"Rather unique among gay films, this presents the dilemma of an overweight
guy hoping to find Mr. Right.  No spoilers here, and the characters are well
portrayed.  What probably kept me from giving it another star was the role
of the very overweight young guy at the book signing near the end.  This
character is on screen far too long, and the dialog between him and the
book author could have been sharply cut without loss of values.  That
said,  the music score is a refreshing change from the constant use of
mediocre rock, and computer generated sounds",1421193600,,556,4.63265306122449
6405132,3,B00K80QHBS,"Bob (Jonathan Lisecki) is a gay man with a good job, great friends and is healthy. He is also on the plump side and in a world of buffed bods and body image worship, he has developed self loathing and cannot grasp why anyone would fancy him. His friends persevere with him, but he seems to turn off everyone, then he meets party chef Andy and despite his best efforts, Andy seems to find him interesting.

Then we have Bob doing his level best to make it work and at the same time let his fears and anxieties overcome all rational thought. Along the way we do have a few laughs, but mostly we have clichd stereo types behaving in a predictable way and nothing new being told. Also for a film that is supposed to show that inner beauty is what counts, we have a rather high toned and fit body count providing the de rigueur eye candy for most gay films. Whether this is supposed to be ironic or to highlight the competition one can only surmise.

Despite the shortcomings this is still a well made movie; it will not change your life or perceptions - if you don't fancy someone, trying to see the inner beauty can take time - and that may also be the message. I read one review that said if it were not for the very attractive Todd Stroik and Ethan Le Phong- as Bob's friends - that this movie would have very little to offer. With a run time of 85 minutes it won't outstay its welcome, but not one that is a keeper.",1420329600,4,1415,4.198529411764706

6405155,1,B00K80QHBS,"One of the worst gay-related comedies I have ever seen.  Unhappily, there are many of them released on DVD  or available to be downloaded these days.  It surprised me, since Gayby was often witty and delightful.  But Big Gay Love is witless, artless, full of self-denigrating stereotypes (even though the movie wishes to be a plea for ""tolerance"" and diversity of all types), improbabilities in the plot to the point of nonsense, and a script so unfocused and random that it seems to have been written by a bored committee without any sense of structure or plausible direction.  It is a bad movie in every conceivable way, badly acted as well as poorly directed and conceived.  I don't get it.  Why are so many American comedies that are primarily for a gay audience so lacking in real humor and wit and so dependent on the hoariest old stereotypes in the business, boring (and dated) as a worn out drag show?",1470009600,3,909,4.64375

6405158,3,B00K80QHBS,"Since I'm a huge fan of Buffy there is no way I wasn't going to watch a gay movie with Nicholas Brendon in it, but I wasn't buying him as a gay man for even one second. There is no chemistry between the male leads. I appreciate a movie about a bigger, more effeminate guy, but the main character is more annoying than seems necessary. I don't know why these two like each other at all. ALSO, he isn't that overweight so it seems like a bit of a non-issue. I'm still trying to figure out what the movie was trying to accomplish with the absurdity of the mother character, but I suppose I appreciate them for really swinging for the fences (the actress doesn't pull it of though, so... sad). I didn't hate it, but a lot of it felt lazy and forced.",1467763200,,745,4.180555555555555
6405159,5,B00K80QHBS,"Great story, without the usual gay cliche body types. I didn't think the movie would be as revealing as it was. It was a joy to watch.",1466812800,,134,4.0
6405160,1,B00K80QHBS,"Poorly acted, unrealistic, and down-right annoying.  Indie gay movies can be excellent (4th Man Out), or at the opposite end of the spectrum, like this one.  The main character is shallow, self absorbed and annoying. Why the ""Andy"" character was attracted to him in the first place is a real stretch. Don't even bother if it's free - I think I wasted a couple of bucks.",1466467200,2,369,4.575757575757576

8656709,1,B00K80QHBS,"Big disappointment. I wanted to like it but the only thing the movie accomplished in doing is creating one of the most unlikable characters I have ever seen. Bob is just one big stereotype. Unfortunately, you've only heightened what most of Middle America thinks about gays as it is: feminine drama queens who cheat...after professing love. I feel bad for Nicholas. And for us who watch this pitiful excuse of a movie.",1491955200,,418,4.819444444444445

8656712,4,B00K80QHBS,"Big Gay Love is both unique and not unique in the oeuvre of gay male cinema in that it uses Bob, neurotic Everyman lead who falls for Andy, the Prom King archetype, and Bob's insecurity threatens to unravel the genuine love that Andy has for him. Before he meets Andy, using Bob as an Everyman with whom the seemingly audience can project its own ambivalence about finding love in an often hostile, looks-obsessed microcosm of Los Angeles functions well. Bob is successful, witty, a mix of self-effacing and self-sabotaging, accessible and an ideal combination of the man you want to root for and the man you want to shake and say, Snap out of it!

The rest of the story doesn't break new ground although the writer-director gives the Bob character more depth than these films usually allow for, particularly the gay rom-coms with the hot boyfriend role played by a gay-friendly straight actor played Nicholas Brendon or John Stamos, etc. There are several times where Bob' behavior tests the audience's sympathy, given that the Bob character often exists as a surrogate for our own experiences. Ultimately, the writer-director depends upon the audience to acknowledge the human capacity for both darkness and light in order to appreciate where his characters ultimately end up.

What I think ultimately sets the film apart most is that Big Gay Love has broken with the caricature of gay men that wider American audiences have seen for decades. We've either seen the slender, barely post-pubescent youth in coming out stories or the incredibly disciplined, muscular and fit men who inhabit a world of perfect skin, protein shakes, and Streisand lighting director. I have no problem with the fact that gay cinema has cast actors with these bodies because it is reality that these body types are more common and more prized in our microcosm. But how about mixing it up a little? Gay men with different bodies have stories to tell, too.

What really sets Big Gay Love apart is that Bob directly addresses his body and his relationship with it. In fact, it's his relationship with his body that threatens the very stability of his love with Andy. Bob lack of self-compassion and how he displaces it onto his body becomes a major barrier to intimacy between him and Andy, keeping the two from getting closer when they're dating. This is a topic that doesn't get enough serious traction within the gay community. I'm not talking Ru Paul-style self-help affirmation. I'm talking serious, empathetic acknowledgement that people's displacement of their self-image issues onto their bodies can prevent them from getting what they want out of life. And that holds as true for husky guys like Bob as it does for gay men with any body type or, like any good movie, it can resonate as a universal message for anyone in our society who's told everyday by advertisers and the corporate media you're supposed to look a certain way.

Big Gay Love can certainly be appreciated as a piece of fluff for someone who wants to watch a Sixteen Candles style gay romance between an Everyman and a dreamboat. And it far from a flawless piece of filmmaking. But it does aim higher than a lot of these films often do and it provoked me accordingly.",1479686400,,3219,4.826086956521739
