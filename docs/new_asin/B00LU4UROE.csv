8668143,3,B00LU4UROE,"Would have given 5 stars if it contained ""Closed Caption"" as advertised.  The original music was removed and the music in it's place was extremely loud making it impossible to understand the dialogue.  Very disappointed, was prepared for the music to be different, but truly expected to at least have CC.",1532995200,,304,4.9411764705882355

8668148,4,B00LU4UROE,"Great show,unfortunately it will not have the Original Soundtrack Music. I contacted Mill Creek Entertainment and they got back to me today 7/28/14 and said that this release will not include the Original Music. No opening  'Paint It Black"" by The Rolling Stones or anything else.",1406505600,25,280,5.086956521739131
8668149,4,B00LU4UROE,"Will  the original songs be included in these reissues , or ... ?? I am a Vietnam and Desert Storm Veteran and really only saw a couple of these shows as originally broadcast; too heavy.

BUT, that being said; when i did catch commercial copies of the show,  the original songs seemed like they were replaced by generic stuff.

MY QUESTION for the reissue folks: WILL WE HAVE THE SOUND CUES ... or at leas annotations in the commentary about ''which song plays where'', so we can cue our own private music?",1406332800,4,506,4.467391304347826
