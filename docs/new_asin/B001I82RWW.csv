3646515,4,B001I82RWW,"This movie goes by two titles, ""Terror Circus"" and ""Barn of the Naked Dead"". Which one fits the best? Well there's terror, but a circus? Some wacko keeps a dozen women chained in a barn and calls him his ""animals"". He claims to be training them for a circus, but all he does is have them walk around a platform, raising and lowering their hands, while he wears a ring masters outfit and cracks a whip. Pretty lame ""circus"".
There is a barn, there are a lot of dead people at the end (most of them not shown) and there is brief nudity at the 22 min mark, although they're alive when it happens. There's also a mutant who lives in an outhouse or shed.
My advice is to buy ""Terror Circus"" (it actually looks pretty good) and call it ""Barn of the Naked Dead"" (which does appear as an alternate title on the ""extras) or maybe ""Shed of the Mutant Dead"".
Also, the cover painting is cool.",1380240000,,881,4.25
3646516,3,B001I82RWW,"This trip to the big top is unlike anything you have ever seen! When three friends run into car trouble on a desolate desert road, they end up at the home of a demented ringmaster who runs his own human circus in the barn out back. His new ""pets"" must obey his every command, otherwise they will receive the whip (or worse)! TERROR CIRCUS is sleazy Exploitation at its finest, but it is handled in a manner that is unbefitting of the genre. Despite its alternate title BARN OF THE NAKED DEAD, there is surprisingly little nudity to be found, although there are a number of bloody deaths and excruciating scenes of violence with the bull whip. The film benefits most from its clean cinematography and the excellent addition of Andrew Prine in the lead. Andre, the circus head, is tortured by his abandonment as a child, which cripples him mentally and causes him to seek out women that he can keep under his control. Price draws out this madness with a deadly seriousness that elevates his performance to a high level of camp. The contorted circus music also adds to the unsettling effect. A suspicious number of elements in the plot can clearly be scene in Wes Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES from 1977, while many other similar themes can be draw between TERROR CIRCUS and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE of the same year. Alan Rudolph's twisted tale is an Exploitation gem that can finally be revisited in its uncut form on DVD thanks to a beautiful transfer from Code Red.

3646517,4,B001I82RWW,"This film was also released back in the day as Barn of the Naked Dead, a much, much snazzier title if you ask me.  I mean, how do you resist a title like Barn of the Naked Dead?  Forget the fact that there is practically no nudity or zombies in the film, the title still rocks.  But Shriek Show released it under it's original title, Terror Circus.
Made in the early 70s, it brings to mind films like Last House on the Left, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc.  Basically movies where women are held captive by wackos.  Here it's Andrew Prine in the psycho role of Andre.  He's a bit more laid back and subdued than say, David Hess in Last House on the Left.  A good loon though.  In this film he lures three stranded women to his home in the desert.  He chains them in his barn, which houses other chained women.  Andre sees the women, not as sex slaves, which you'd normally guess for this kind of movie, but as his own pets, his circus animals.  He's a bit like a demented Sigfried and Roy with the captive women as his tigers.  He makes them do odd circus type antics, sometimes he wears a top hat and uses a whip(sounds like my honeymoon).  Anyone who doesn't cooperate or tries to escape is killed by Andre's live lion(I think it's a lion anyway).  One of the captive women bears a striking resemblance to Andre's long lost mother, and this begins his downfall as he frees her and treats her as such.  Soon a jailbreak is in order, but there's one more card in the deck, and I'm not gonna give that away.  Lets just say that it again has to do with Andre's family, and it's a cool ending.
I liked this movie quite a bit.  It's not nearly as brutal as the more controversial films of the time that tried to push the envelope in brutality.  There is very little to no nudity, not much graphic violence, and gore is minimal.  It goes more for the messed up psychological angle and does succeed on some points rather well.
The film was directed by Alan Rudolph, who went on to make the Moore/Willis flick Mortal Thoughts, Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle, and bizarro comedies like Breakfast Of Champions and Trixie.
The Shriek Show disc has an informative featurette with crew(and one cast) members.  I would however like to see the Johnny Legend edition of this film that has an interview with Andrew Prine.  Not to mention it uses the Barn of the Naked Dead title.
Oh, those wacky 70s.",1240790400,5,2386,4.365079365079365
3646518,5,B001I82RWW,"Terror Circus dvd AKA as barn of the naked dead
I have been into this movie for years. I bought it on vhs years ago and was really bumed out. Then in 2005 i bought a bootleg on DVD with japenesse subtiles It looked alot beter, still I could have only dreamed that the negatives still existed. Now i have the terror circus dvd and wow! this thing looks great. The movie is way more creepy seeing it in hi-def. If you still have a bootleg throw those out and get this one now! Its really a movie only for a certain crowd, but if your fan this is the copy to get. Also this is the most complete version out there, the other ones are missing certain parts, including a scene of the women bathing, while andre watches. very entertaing stuff for 1970s drive in trash.",1052784000,4,761,4.183673469387755
8310495,5,B001I82RWW,"From the acclaimed director of ""The Moderns"", ""Trouble in Mind"" and ""Choose Me"" we have a timeless, heartwarming tale of a deranged man living in rural Nevada who kidnaps stranded female motorists (which there seem to be an inordinate amount of for rural Nevada) and, bullwhip in hand, trains them to perform in his private circus, all the while his father who has been turned into deformed monster by radiation from nuclear tests runs amuck.
As other reviewers have noted there is a definite lack of nakedness in this movie alternatively titled ""Barn of the Naked Dead"", but a lot of bare breasts and female buttocks would only distract from the real (and perhaps only) reason to see this movie--Andrew Prine. Andrew Prine was second only to David Hess when it came to portraying sick psychopaths in 70's drive-in movies, but where Hess's psychos were just flat-out creeps, Prine's could be hilariously funny (even though it wasn't always clear whether the actor himself was in on the joke as he always seemed to take these roles VERY seriously). While this is far from his best work, Prine is always fun to watch.",1523145600,,1115,4.8125
8310496,1,B001I82RWW,"When I streamed this flick, I thought, ""Oh boy, a blast from the past,"" because I literally have not seen it in 43 years.  I was a teenager when it originally hit the grindhouse and drive-in screens in the mid-1970s.  In the first few minutes, as soon as I heard the cheesy musical score (funky horn section accompanied by electric bass), I immediately remembered WHY I haven't seen it in 43 years.

Stranded girls befriend a helpful stranger, end up in a barn performing tricks for a lunatic.  That's it.

I HATED this movie back then and I still hate it.  It's formula 1970s low-budget suspense/horror, totally predictable, more exasperating than horrifying, the sort of junk that Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino nostalgically glamorize.  But there's nothing glamorous about the original genre.",1519516800,,803,5.037878787878788
8310497,2,B001I82RWW,"But hey, it is horror :)

I don't think pop was NEAR the H bomb explosion. I think he was IN it :)  Then sat in the highest radiation area for about 3 years lol",1519171200,,160,3.5428571428571427
8310498,5,B001I82RWW,"TERROR CIRCUS (aka: BARN OF THE NAKED DEAD- 1974) is the crackpot tale of Andre (Andrew Prine- SIMON, KING OF THE WITCHES, GRIZZLY, THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN), an insane circus ""performer"" and his ""animals"". After their car breaks down in the desert, Simone (Manuela Thiess) and her two friends encounter a seemingly rational, very helpful Andre, who takes them back to his place. Upon entering Andre's barn, the women discover his ""collection"" of nine women! Chained and held prisoner like the others in the barn, the women are forced to perform ""tricks"" like circus animals. Andre has many serious issues, mostly having to do w/ a past abandonment by his mum. Now, his twisted vengeance is taken out on his captives. Any disobedience is dealt w/ in a terrible fashion. This, all while their manager and the sheriff search for Simone and her friends. Will they find them, before Andre shows everyone just how unhinged he really is? Meanwhile, a marauding monster roams the surrounding desert, slaughtering the unwary. Part PSYCHO, part TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, and 100% BONKERS, this movie is truly one of a kind! The frustrating finale is one for the ages! Let's all sing the theme song together, ""Eeeeee-vil Eyes!""...",1518998400,3,1224,5.004901960784314
8310499,3,B001I82RWW,I liked it. I thought Andrew Pine was really good in this film as the sick demented antagonistic tormentor.,1464220800,,107,4.684210526315789
8310500,1,B001I82RWW,"Where to begin with this ? Like a few others have mentioned, this film plays like a made for TV movie; and a bad one at that. The acting is terrible (I refuse to believe there was a script), the special effects (what little there are) are pitiful (BBQ sauce and strawberry jam). There's no suspense or plot. It's not bad enough to be good, and not good enough to be campy. The biggest frustration was that the chains around the women's necks were incredibly loose, yet no one thought to just slip them over their heads?? Watching a free infomercial DVD that you received in the mail would be more entertaining than this snoozer. There's a reason it had several name changes in a few short years, and was unavailable for so long, not because it's ""shocking"", but because it's pointless. This was definitely made for the drive-in's, but I'm sure many drove away before it was over. I love campy and bad grindhouse movies, but this one ...ugh.",1444953600,2,940,4.535294117647059
8310501,1,B001I82RWW,"Three showgirls on their way to Vegas break down in the desert. They are aided by Andre (Andrew Pine) who imprisons them by chaining them in a barn along with other beautiful girls whose car broke down nearby. Andre doesn't have a full deck and forces the girls to do things like walk in a circle. There is really no circus or show. The film has other titles such as ""Nightmare Dead"" and ""The Barn of the Naked Dead."" All of which are misleading.

It was interesting to see people smoke in a restaurant and eat breakfast where half the plate is bacon. This film is most fitting as the third film of a Drive-in presentation. Starts out with promise, but fizzles.

Brief nudity.",1403395200,3,676,4.443548387096774
8310502,4,B001I82RWW,I wanted to see this movie because Robert Taylor's step-daughter was in it and Constance Bennet's daughter is in it too.  It turned out to be a fairly good story.,1401321600,4,162,4.4
8310503,3,B001I82RWW,"The film was taken from a synopsis, handed to a budding screenwriter still with minimal talents and formed into a package of both fun and ugh, there must be another word for it...effort towards the completion of the films producer.  Gerard Cormier, a wonderful man had a need to make a film and with the support of his family they accomplished this task. As the films ""screenwriter,"" I would have preferred something other than the task given me, but meeting the Cormier's and others associated with this effort, I am pleased the time was well spent with truly good people and watching their dreams come true.

I believe I am not saying anything out of school because I am certain I either heard or read that this is the one film Andrew Prine wished he hadn't made.  Andrew, a wonderful stage and film actor and perhaps, just perhaps this remains his one ""indiscretion"" who is to say?

Overall, just for the fun, ""Terror Circus"" would be a good way to spend the night with some popcorn - it is, after all, bubble gum for the eyes and a look during a time in film history where almost anything goes.

Gerard Cormier, the films creator, passed away recently and I regret not retaining the friendship we once knew so many years ago.
Rest well ""Jerry,"" you remain a very good man.",1386892800,3,1276,4.530434782608696
