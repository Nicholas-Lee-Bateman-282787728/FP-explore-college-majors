866830,5,6304362404,"May(Susan Dey) is a birthday party stripper waiting for a break as an actress.  Jonathan(Tom Hulce) is a pizza delivery man with songwriting aspirations.  August(Michael Bowen) is a personal trainer at a seedy gym who thinks he's a ""body sculptor"".  What connects these three is hope, desperation, and love for each other while they cope with life in one of Los Angeles' seedier neighborhoods.  ""Echo Park"" is warm and funny and eminently likable.  This quirky film wouldn't work if you didn't empathize with the main characters.  I strongly behoove you to take a chance on this little film with big heart.  Trivia buffs will have a field day here.  Cassandra Peterson was better known as late night horror hostess, Elvira.  John Paragon is best known as playing Jombi on ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"".  Timothy Carey had prominent roles in two early Stanley Kubrick efforts, ""The Killing"" and ""Paths of Glory"".  Walter Shenson produced this film as well as the Beatles ""A Hard Days Night"" and ""Help!"".  Musical supervisor Bill Wyman is better known as the Rolling Stones"" bassist.",1330646400,6,1073,5.0
866831,4,6304362404,"This is a fun, light comedy featuring a young Tom Hulce and Susan Day with a charming cast of characters! The humor is excellent, the situations and dialogue are genuinely funny and the actors are all really excellent in their quirky roles. Don't look for a boffo Hollywood finish when they all finally ""make it"" to the top of show business. That's just not in the cards, but the story is quite entertaining to the very end.

If you are looking for a good romantic comedy for a girls' night in, you won't go wrong with Echo Park.",1284940800,6,529,4.3979591836734695

7870459,3,6304362404,The warning about regional coding that is so clear WAS NOT PRESENT when I purchased this as a used DVD.  I spent a bit of time being angry but then I ripped the disc and burned a copy as an MKV.  It's a small enough file that I was able to make a lossless copy.  Look up DVD Shrink.,1517097600,,282,3.7457627118644066

7870466,5,6304362404,Relationship type movie about single mom. Some religious undertones but not noticeable.  I enjoyed watching it.  The ending was excellent.  A movie about relationships and communication. Nice concepts for understanding single moms.  I would buy it again if I didn't already have it.,1403913600,,282,5.488372093023256
