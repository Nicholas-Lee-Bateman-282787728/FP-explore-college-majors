7508236,5,B017NESD5O,I was trying to teach my daughter addition on my own and she just wasnr getting not the way I was teaching it.  I orders the dvd and after the third viewing she had it down!  Now I can just use worksheets and the chalkboard to reinforce!  We're almost ready to order dvd #2 but want to make sure she's solid before doing so.  I love preschool prep,1454198400,4,347,4.0588235294117645
7508237,5,B017NESD5O,"Meet the Math Facts is such a great learning tool. My grandsons (21 months and 5 years old) love these videos, and they are excited every time I buy a new one. Everything clicked so quickly with the 5 year old, and the little guy walks around saying the things he hears in the video, and correctly points out some of the numbers when he sees them other places.",1492473600,,360,4.231884057971015
7508238,5,B017NESD5O,My 7 year old son is autistic. I am always trying to find different ways for him to learn and enjoy learning.  He loves this DVD and he is constantly reciting to me the math facts.,1487030400,2,180,4.0
7508239,5,B017NESD5O,Great way to learn in a fun way.  Great for the car ride as well.,1483747200,,65,3.3333333333333335
7508240,5,B017NESD5O,Great fun and learning,1480896000,,22,4.75

7508242,1,B017NESD5O,"It's math equations repeated over and over. I should have thought about this before I purchased the DVD, but I doubt this will be of any help to my grandson. It doesn't really teach anything and as far as helping someone cement information in one's memory, the act of recalling information for oneself is what strengthens the neuronal connections. This DVD isn't likely to hold anyone's interest long enough for one to get to the point of memorization simply from  watching.",1478131200,,474,4.851851851851852
7508243,4,B017NESD5O,Hope this helps.,1478044800,,16,4.666666666666667
7508244,5,B017NESD5O,"2yo and 4yo love these vidoes (they have levels 1-3) and insist on watching them every day at least twice a day one right after the other.

Our youngins did NOT enjoy the rock-and-learn version of learning (none of them). The audio on Math Facts is catchy and animation is cute. Gives little ones something to enjoy while learning. On the rock-and-learn version, the music is so bad that no one in our house will allow the dvd's to play more than 5m and they are going off.",1474588800,3,473,4.375
7508245,4,B017NESD5O,"We have been big fans of the ""Meet The"" videos. We have the entire set of reading DVDs. We purchased just Math Facts 1 to see how it works. It is basically the same set up as their other videos. Lots of repetition. What I don't like is that they don't always have the symbol. For example, they will show a cow making pancakes and counting the pancakes. In the back ground you may hear ""1 plus 1 equals 2"". The numbers flash on the screen but they don't always flash the symbol. It would be better if you always had the plus or minus symbol.

The kids love it and ask to watch it each night. I don't think my kids are really getting the concept of addition/subtraction as much as they are memorizing the tables. It is a start for them. They are 5 and 3. I have noticed my 5 year old writing out addition problems.",1467244800,5,812,4.1069182389937104
7508246,5,B017NESD5O,My son loves the whole preschool prep series .  We work with him daily so by the age of two he was already counting objects and not just memorizing the numbers .  That's when we decided to buy this DVD .  It's been about four months and I don't think he gets the concept yet but it does keep his attention and it does get him more familiar with what the numbers look like .  I ate your old nephew spends quite a bit of time over here and he always asks if we can watch meet the math facts .  it helps to memorize learn . They both like to sing the song .,1466035200,2,554,3.782608695652174

8739900,5,B017NESD5O,These videos by preschool prepco are the best.  They have taught all my kids(including my minmally verbal autistic child) to read and all their math facts.  I am about to buy the multiplication ones and are very excited.  I have bought several sets for relatives and friends because this is the perfect gift for parents of small children.,1521590400,,338,4.793103448275862
8739901,5,B017NESD5O,Our son was raised on Preschool Prep and I can honestly say that they have helped him excel in school. Math Facts was just the next step and he loves it! I always recommend Preschool Prep videos to family and friends.,1511913600,,217,4.317073170731708

8739903,5,B017NESD5O,"Love, love, love math facts. My 5-year old learned the facts quickly, and even my 3-year old says ""6 plus 6 is 12, mommy"". I recommend preschool prep to everyone I know who has young kids.",1509494400,,188,4.25
8739904,3,B017NESD5O,"Video presentation in the beginning are good because they repeat the equation 4 times so children will remember. But halfway, they only repeat once and on a faster mode.  So it's like you only pay for half..as children will not learn or will learn harder on a super fast approach on the 2nd half of the video.",1506470400,,309,4.421052631578948
8739905,5,B017NESD5O,Very happy with this video and all things preschool prep they are so smart in how. They teach little ones. Keeps my son's insterest and is helping improve his math skills which are already good. Great product,1501372800,,208,4.648648648648648
8739906,5,B017NESD5O,This is a good DVD.  My granddaughter is 3 and a little young for this.  But she loves to watch it and is getting the concept of math.  I have no doubt she will learn from this DVD,1497830400,,180,3.6842105263157894
8739907,5,B017NESD5O,My 4 1/2 year old grandson likes the math videos. They seem to be presented in a way that a preschooler can understand and remember.,1497571200,,132,4.32
8739908,1,B017NESD5O,My kids really disliked this video. Too repetitive and boring. :/,1496793600,,65,5.0
