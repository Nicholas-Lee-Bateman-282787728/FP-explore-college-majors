1676330,5,B00005YCFL,"This movie is so unbelievably beyond the scope of the human language that I feel the only way to properly start my review is to simply create a new word and have its meaning be tied to this movie. And here goes:
Pandalerious
This movie is so pandalerious that I don't even know where to begin. I could start at the beginning of the movie, but thats where I started when I watched it, and I still don't know what the actual plot of the movie was about. Drugs I think. Vampires definitly. And lets not forget the love scene between a ghost-woman and a man in an ape costume. Of course, no vampire can stand up to Robo Warrior. Now on the cover of the movie, clearly you can see Robo Cop headlocking a vampire. Not only is Robo Cop NOT in this movie, there are also NO headlocks whatsoever! Instead we get some goon in a teflon oven mitt costume that cant even take a few rockets to the chest without turning into a flaming dummy made out of tinfoil (special effect #1). Of course, Robo Warrior comes back for the final revenge, when he turns the evil master of the vampires into a flying pile of sheets draped onto a coathanger suspended by a wire (special effect #2)
To conclude, I will say that if you like terrible movies, this one is for you
Otherwise, do yourself a favor and go see Zero Tolerance",1080000000,19,1300,4.267206477732794

I have no words to describe it, and I cannot believe it came out on dvd! this is so awful we laugh all the movie long! the vampires jumping like rabbits, the fake blood, the stupid argument...this is really the number one movie on BAD MOVIES! this is even worse than TROMA movies! this is....I'm speachless...",1078272000,5,376,4.544117647058823

7956937,5,B00005YCFL,"Robo Vampire may be the best ""bad movie"" to enjoy. If you are a fan of bad movies, particularly of the horror genre, I couldn't recommend this movie any more (to someone who loves B movies). Of the 100+ bad movies I have watched with my friends, this stood out as one of the best (and my personal favorite).  This is a must watch/own!",1429056000,,334,4.21875

7956939,3,B00005YCFL,"I saw Robo Vampire as part of a 50 movie Si-Fi boxset. The boxset of chock full of horrible movies - horrible acting, plots, special effects, and direction - ROBO VAMPIRE has them all. But this movie is so hysterically engaging it had me laughing very loudly out loud throughout.. The most fun of all is watching the Vampires who hop like rabbits when attacking. The director made this movie while drunk, or with the intention of pushing PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE off of the number one spot of  the worst movie ever made list. If the latter he succeeded.",1403308800,,552,4.465346534653466
7956940,5,B00005YCFL,"I really have no idea wtf I just watched! Honest to god! First, vampires were hopping around like giant, kung-fu kangaroos in robes. Then, drug smugglers were stuffing heroin into a cow carcass. Before I knew it, snakes were everywhere, and a guy blew a bubble out of his forehead! No kidding! Much martial arts and a floating woman later, and I'm feeling like I've been drinking drano and vodka cocktails again! Did I mention the man / ghost in the Wal-Mart go-rilla mask? Suddenly, floating lady is marrying the go-rilla guy, and here comes the gun battle! Wow! Those hopping vampires are shooting smoke out of their fingers and... are those sparklers?? Quick, into the Suzuki pick-up truck! Ah-ha! Now they're building a humanoid robot! Dear lord! This could be the best movie ever made! A priest just got owned by thugs! Right in front of Jesus! More sparklers! There goes a blond babe w/ a machine gun! Attempted rape leads to more kung-fu! A rescue mission is underway. Oh my! Here's ROBO VAMPIRE, arresting drug smugglers! Now, he's battling go-rilla mask guy! His robo voice is very effective. More gunfire! In boats! Explosions! The blond is being water-tortured! Please, stop her awful moaning! The scene shifts to an impromptu arm-wrestling contest, leading to further kung-fu! And guns! Lots of guns! Characters keep popping in at random. Scenes shift wildly! ROBO VAMPIRE marches on. Things burst into flame for no reason. I have left my body! I am no more...",1362182400,,1472,4.868525896414343
7956941,1,B00005YCFL,"This movie has major league camp value and is extremely bad in all aspects. Drug smugglers use ""vampires"" to help them combat law enforcement. These are not western ideas of vampires, but that of the orient. Vampire is a generic phrase used to indicate one that has come back from the dead. It is more akin to a zombie in a guerrilla mask. In this film the vampires move with their arms extended while hopping. The plot continuity of their abilities doesn't make any sense.

One of the vampires has a witch ghost as its lover. She is upset that he was made into a vampire, so now they can't be together in the afterlife, but she gets over it.

The Robo Vampire is really a robocop. He is created to fight the vampires. The dubbing was bad, even though the credits claimed they had a dialouge coach. The voices didn't match the faces either. Rice powder will wake up vampires.

The film has a high 5 star MST value.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity.",1355270400,,947,4.425287356321839

7956943,1,B00005YCFL,"Just terrible. A slow-motion cinematic train wreck. Effects so cheap and a plot so atrocious, it would embarrass Ed Wood.",1327104000,,121,5.1
7956944,5,B00005YCFL,"This movie has it all: Indiscriminate use of fireworks in place of special effects. Tin foil robot stunt double. Second generation ultra powerful hopping vampire as identified by dollar store gorilla mask. Ghost and gorilla-vampire romance. Jedi trained robo-cop ripoff. Drug lord that looks like Bert from Tremors. The list goes on and on.

They say 'dont judge a book by its cover'. That could not be more true here. Robo-cop (or anything that could be mistaken for robocop even in poor lighting) is not in this movie. There are no robot vampires only a robot warrior that ineffectually combats drug smuggling vampires. There are no headlocks, helicopters, or explosions comparable to those depicted on the cover.

Take two movies, quite possibly the worst movies of all time, and use them to build a mutant hybrid bad movie. That might describe Robo Vampire.

That said, I loved it. Best <$5 I have ever spent. If you purchase this movie be prepared to go frame by frame or in slow motion at any moment to dissect some unbelievably terrible film making.

The back cover picture on the Amazon product page indicates that some part of this product is made in Canada. As a Canadian this one of the most insulting, libellous statements I have ever come across.

$100 for a new copy? Are you people insane? Perhaps this means you will give me $100 if I take this garbage off of your hands? Anyone can go watch this monstrosity on Youtube for nothing.",1296864000,6,1448,4.73015873015873
