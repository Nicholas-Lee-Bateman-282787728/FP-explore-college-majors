8076389,2,B000A8NSRE,"Racetrack farce THE BIG PAYOFF! (actually, ""Win, Place or Steal"") gets two stars instead of one only because of the many fine actors who were unfortunately involved in a nag of a project that got out of the gate last and not only didn't run ""in the money"" but entirely failed to finish the race.

This forced attempt at slapstick comedy is a slow-moving story of three men who scheme to remove a betting machine from a racetrack so they can print their own winning tickets.

It's no big surprise that this movie is NOT available on DVD.
RECOMMENDED: Pierce Brosnan stars in THE HEIST (1989)-- a satisfying racetrack crime caper that has more twists and turns than Churchill Downs!!
