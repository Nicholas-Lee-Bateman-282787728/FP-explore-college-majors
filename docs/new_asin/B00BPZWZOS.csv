5665133,5,B00BPZWZOS,"Anyone interested in starting a family through adoption can experience one child's story as told by his forever mom and dad. International adoption is one way to adopt, and this story (circa 2011) shares the highlights of adopting from Moscow Russia prior to the ban on U.S. Citizens adopting from Russia. Adoption is a complex topic and requires the coordination by the forever family of many government and non government agencies to accomplish. This story highlights the main activities a forever family experiences to bring home a child from a Russian orphanage. Among the pages and pages of paperwork and medical and government appointments, this forever family is gracious enough to share their hearts and tears of joy during a legal and personal situation many will never experience. THANK YOU for your dedication to adoption and helping others get a snapshot into one truly exceptional way to have a family. I am personally touched to know Joshua found his forever family. I hope other families will be inspired to find adoption is an option. My son Kirusha came home from Russia in 2009; He is the love of my life!!",1388880000,,1124,4.921052631578948
5665134,4,B00BPZWZOS,A short and sweet documentary. Very nicely put together. I enjoyed how positive it felt and how it was filmed.,1388880000,2,110,4.55
5665135,5,B00BPZWZOS,"Dear Rasco Family,

  Thanks for sharing your heart-warming journey! I agree that the Spirit of adoption wonderfully illustrates God's love to a world that often forgets what true nurturing is all about! May you continue to be blessed in every way!

5665136,3,B00BPZWZOS,"This is a 25 minute video concerning a family that was able to adopt a boy from Russia before the passing of a law that banned all American adoptions of Russian children.
There is a 16 minute extra of a family who adopted a girl from China and a list of international adoption tips. There are no subtitles.

The main film tells the story of the Rasco family and their journey to adopt Joshua. They tell of the paperwork and expense and their joy at bringing him home to their family.
The extra tells the tale of the La Suer family and how their faith helped then in the adoption process from China. Their voices are a bit nasal and they are hard to understand at times.

There is really not too much specific information on how to accomplish these adoptions and no word on the ban on Russian adoptions. Both films are oddly lacking in conveying the emotion, sentiment and inspiration that one would expect.",1379289600,2,906,4.451807228915663

5665138,2,B00BPZWZOS,"This wasn't bad to watch, but there really was no point. The description is misleading. There is very little substance. No discussion of why Russia, the cost, and only a basic overview of the process. There is a lot of talk about how adoption is doing God's work. If you don't feel like going to Sunday school, skip this one.",1420243200,10,325,4.433333333333334

5665142,2,B00BPZWZOS,"This movie was directed by the family that it features.  It is beautifully shot, but there were times when this movie felt like a not-so-subtle advertisement for international adoption, or a very well done home movie.

What I liked:

- The cinematography was beautiful.  I think that the Rascos did the filming themselves (although I could be wrong) and they are clearly better than your average mommy/daddy with a camcorder.

- The Rascos discussed the financial cost of an international adoption and the mounds of paperwork involved..

- Cute babies and beautiful families.  Because who doesn't like those things?  Also, the Rascos seem like genuniely good and passionate people.

What I disliked:

- I felt like I was being preached to.  Arthur Rasco does most of the narrating and he is extremely...dramatic.  He clearly has an agenda, and the agenda is showing you how amazing international adoption is.  I don't think he was lying, but it didn't feel exactly open and honest, either.

- The parents do not discuss why they chose to adopt internationally instead of locally.  They also do not discuss why they chose to adopt from Russia instead of any other country, given that Russia is a very expensive country to adopt from.  Did they even consider adopting a U.S. kid, or a kid from a different country (and race)?  They may have valid reasons, but don't even address the issue.

- The parents talk about adoption as if they are rescuing a kid from a terrible fate, but they make no effort to show us what that fate is.  We only see one room of the orphanage, which is actually very pleasent.  There's no attempt to interview other kids or the orphanage staff.  In fact, there's no attempt to show any other viewpoint except that of the parents.

This is definitely not a documentary.  No difficult questions are asked and very little real information is actually presented. This is somewhere between a home movie and an advertisement for international adoptions.  It's nicely shot, but that's about it.",1400198400,7,2012,4.832844574780059
5665143,4,B00BPZWZOS,This movie shows the arduous process a family goes through to adopt a little boy from Russia.  As an adoptive parent myself I could relate to the emotional journey the family must go through to bring Joshua home.  Each adoption journey is unique and I enjoyed watching this family's experience!,1399161600,,294,4.86
5665144,5,B00BPZWZOS,This was a wonderful look at positive adoption. I love how the mom thought about the birth mom. Joshua looks so happy as do the other siblings. I'd love to hear how the family is doing today. :),1395187200,,194,4.131578947368421
5665145,5,B00BPZWZOS,"Loved the story of this family and their willingness to share it publicly. We are praying about adopting and while this was a short film, it was very well-rounded in covering some basic issues that most people probably deal with in an international adoption: already having your own kids, cost, multiple visits to the child's country.",1391817600,3,334,4.982142857142857
5665146,2,B00BPZWZOS,Nice to know that is not impossible to adopt kids...even if it is in another country Never understand  why if the kids are available the system make it impossible,1390867200,,162,4.586206896551724

8572334,1,B00BPZWZOS,The father in this story loves the sound of his own voice.  I had to shut it off in the end; I don't need to be preached to and I was sick of hearing him.  Pretty tedious.  Baby is cute.,1487635200,,186,3.6

8572340,5,B00BPZWZOS,Very heartwarming and beautiful story of one life that will forever be changed because of two loving people.  Adoption is a wonderful thing and it's sad that it is so expensive.  I loved how the church and friends all pitched in to help raise money to bring little Joshua home.  It was good to see how this community of people rallied together to make this possible.  Would like to see an update on how he and the family is doing now but I am almost certain he is doing well and very much loved upon!,1434758400,,500,4.231578947368421
