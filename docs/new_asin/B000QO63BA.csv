2839097,5,B000QO63BA,"It's a great 70's movie. I remember a long time ago watching the movie and being scared. Carlos Enrique Taboada is a great movie director I wish to find more of his outstanding work,i also have the movie ""Hasta el viento tiene miedo""  which I think has more action than this movie,also directed by him. This is a good movie it has a good scary, eerie story,what stays on you're mind is that old woman's face,after you watch the movie you have a feeling you  will see her face everywhere you look. I recommend this movie if you like classic horror films that are very rare to find,like this one. Their are top of the line good actors. A good production,great direction,It is a movie that if you beleive in ghosts it will scare the hell out of you. It's GREAT!!!I also recommend ""Hasta el viento tiene miedo"".",1179273600,6,807,4.445945945945946
2839098,4,B000QO63BA,"BLACKER THAN THE NIGHT opens w/ the death of an elderly woman, witnessed only by her cat. The scene switches to a house full of beautiful women. One of them, named Ofelia, is the old woman's niece. As such, she inherits her aunt's home, land, and fortune. The only stipulation is that Ofelia must keep the cat, named Bequer. The four women move into the mansion right away. They are met by the stolid, sour-faced maid, Sofia. Bequer soon makes his appearance, and begins acting strange. Events occur of a mysterious, macabre nature- unexplained property damage, disembodied moans, etc.. Is the aunt still alive, or is her ghost roaming the halls of the estate? What does Sofia have to do w/ the bizarre goings on? BTTN is an adequate, ssllloooww-building spooker from 1975. Most of the true ""shocks"" happen toward the end. Spanish w/ English subtitles...",1401494400,4,854,4.8561643835616435
2839099,4,B000QO63BA,"This is a great little movie. I say 'little' because it's a genre film which may be a minor horror classic. A few silly conventions of the period (nubile girls modeling fashions of the past) creep in, but the only criticism I can seriously offer is in the film's format. The movie clearly hasn't been properly restored , and the format is full-screen pan and scan; fortunately, this disc still has a good picture. True, this edition does not feature English subtitles, but, strangely, this did not affect my enjoyment of the film. I found myself further and further pulled into the supernatural web of director Carlos Enrique Taboada. Mas Negro drips atmosphere, and Taboada composed a number of interesting subtexts involving the conflict between the traditions of Old Mexico and the new hipster youth culture emerging in the wake of the 1960's.

Mas Negro que la Noche is an excellent film, and I recommend it to all fans of the traditional supernatural cinema. The scenes in the library stacks are a must for students of the genre and hold their own against anything produced. Buy this whether you understand Spanish or not!",1393286400,6,1127,4.839378238341969
2839100,3,B000QO63BA,"El Deseo en Otono(1972) is a drama/horror/mystery film starring Maricruz Olivier and directed by Carlos Enrique Taboada. Olivier plays Elena, a chemistry teacher who has to deal with two spiteful students and a verbally abusive, insane mother. She endures happier times as her ""hippy"" friend moves in with her and she finds a good looking boyfriend. For some reason, the opening credits have a mellow English language song. Carlos Enrique Taboada makes us feel just as schizophrenic as Elena. Are people trying to harm Elena or is all this madness just in her mind? El Deseo en Otono is similar to Carrie(1976) and Psycho II(1983). The only extras on this DVD are a video spot for another film and a chapter index. El Deseo en Otono is hardly a simple good guys vs. bad guys story. Olivier plays a predator in this film. In one scene, the director films a spider in front of Elena's face. El Deseo en Otono is a solid film from 1970's Mexico.",1341360000,,942,4.6467065868263475
2839101,1,B000QO63BA,"This DVD has no subtitle menu, thus NO English.  This is a bit of a rip off since this is not clear on product description page.",1320710400,10,128,3.923076923076923
2839102,5,B000QO63BA,"Elena's mother lived only to make her daughter's life miserable. Now that she's gone, Elena (Maricruz Olivier) finds out she had a little treasure hidden and now is all hers. Since she always lived a simple life, her friend Clara (Sonia Furio) is trying to convince her to take a trip, go see the world, improve the old house... but Elena is not sure... she is not used to be alone and asks Clara to move in with her.
Clara is happy with the news, because, in the most intimate part of her being, she feels something special about Elena... So special that they both sleep in the same bed!
Elena finally takes that trip and goes to visit a relative, where she meets Victor (Guillermo Murray), a handsome and charming man and before coming back home, marries him.
When she sees them arriving, Clara is frozen with disbelief. Now Elena shows not only a new flashy wardrobe and hairdo, but a handsome husband to match! That is not good, she doesn't trust him and start seeing things Elena supposedly don't see, blinded by the passionate relationship.
Suspicion gets in Elena's head trough some anonymous notes she receive, and since she is not sure where they're coming from, she starts taking precautions.
Some little accidents around the house and the signature for a Life Insurance, makes Elena decide Victor is really something very different from what he say he is. Besides, Victor is a twice widower, and her former wives died in strange circumstances... is it right to doubt?
Clara moves out and Elena start seeing things in another way, soon she will find out who's right and who's wrong, hopefully not too late!

This is a very interesting movie with the ''Taboada'' touch of mystery and suspense.",1316822400,,1702,4.7114093959731544

2839104,4,B000QO63BA,"This certainly is a great horror movie. You don't need gore and blood to accomplish scaring the audience either, just as Enrique Taboada proves with this film. I wouldn't say it's his best, but nonetheless a great film.

The plot is creepier than the scenes. You know what to expect, and that's the part that scares you the most. This movie is great!",1218412800,3,350,4.555555555555555

2839107,5,B000QO63BA,"Carlos Enrique Taboada, one of Mexico's most distinguishable directors wrote and directed this masterpiece of Mexican horrors. The film was produced by Estudios Churubusco (Mexico's Hollywood), and the recognizable score can be credited to Raul Lavista (who also did the score for Taboada's Hasta el viento tiene miedo, and, El libro de piedra.

I strongly recommend this film to anybody interested in a bloodless and goreless classical horror film that will have an effect on you.",1213920000,2,481,5.328947368421052
