8408056,4,B003XF1VSY,"Great movie and fantastic dubbing , hopefully it will be on BLU-RAY soon, at the moment it is on Germany AMAZON but only in it's original German soundtrack, the DVD picture quality is good considering it's age, you can tell its taken from the original reel , well worth it though.",1437523200,2,280,4.509803921568627
8408057,5,B003XF1VSY,"This film deals with a subject that was heavy for its time about child abduction/murder. Excellent acting, great script... You can watch this movie with the family as it does not exactly show the acts but it does get the message across for children/young adults receiving candy from a so-called friendly stranger & accepts the invitation to see him. The title refers to the incident happening in broad daylight & not necessarily in a ""bad part of town"". I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I enjoyed it.",1408406400,3,506,4.633333333333334
8408058,4,B003XF1VSY,"I first saw this film when it was first released in the late 1950s. The novel was written and the screenplay co-written by Friedrich Durrenmatt, the German-Swiss author who also wrote ""The Visit."" Starring the fabulous team of Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontaine in the final production of their illustrious 40-year theater career, ""The Visit"" made a last impression on me when I saw it at roughly the same period. Like ""The Visit,"" it explores the dark side of human nature - revenge and greed in ""The Visit,"" sexual deviancy and child murder here. The material also intrigued Sean Penn and Jack Nicholson, so much so they made an American version of the novel, ""The Pledge"" (the title of the original novel). The German version (rather well dubbed in English) seems to be the better version, and Gert Frobe (who won the role of Goldfinger in the Bond film thanks to this film) is wonderfully creepy in it. But woe is me! This is a sorry video, one rather quickly scanned from a battered 50s print. And to hell with all the DRM on it!",1395360000,3,1030,4.572972972972973
8408059,5,B003XF1VSY,"The original German film from the late 50's. Not nearly as depressing as the American re-make starring Jack Nicholson.
Marred of course by the dubbing. However the film and the performances shine through. Excellent quirky lead detective matched by a scary child killer Gert Forbe. Excellent little film at a bargain price too",1374710400,2,325,5.150943396226415
8408060,5,B003XF1VSY,"Great movie about a child murderer, lots of suspense. Brings back memories. Gert frobe is great in it, it was the part who brought him to play Goldfinger. Great German classic,",1370995200,,176,4.709677419354839
8408061,3,B003XF1VSY,"this was a movie dubbed in english very well,
some might say at the time that this was made that its subject matter should be hidden or down played, in reality it was really quite the opposite,
in my humble opinion it was tastefully made to warn the audience of a serious danger to young children that today is oh so real. Thank God to the best of my knowledge this was fiction not a true story, we have all seen the true stories on modern news television, I hope the message that is portrayed in this movie of people in law enforcement being so persistant in solving such disturbing crimes against children is even 10 percent true.
As you watch this movie look at the typical people involved and their reactions to something none of them want to totally accept or acknowledge, also the panic and false accusations in a more primative time of crime investigation, way before dna and modern forensic capability. This movie grips you early and you are hooked to see the ending,good acting and directing all through, the print is very rare and extremely hard to find so I was amazed at the quality which I consider very watchable.
Thanks to ""sinister cinema"" there is a decent print available, please don't be mislead by the companys name ""sinister cinema"", this is not an ""exploitation film"" but it is a very well made drama on a sensitive and serious subject, an interesting mystery that I won't reveal the climatic ending.",1343433600,4,1422,4.602362204724409
8408062,5,B003XF1VSY,"dark noir early German Crime Drama - interesting option: original language or dubbed english and surprisingly, both work - money well spent",1341705600,,139,5.363636363636363
8408063,5,B003XF1VSY,"I am  in my fifties and my Mother would keep me home from school when this film aired (on 'Mel's Matinee') to make sure I understood the danger of speaking to strangers - even nice ones! (With chocolates or puppets!)  Even ones who might possibly look like an adult I knew.  I was terrified - but happy to say, the warning worked and I was very, very careful. The film is expertly made.",1327795200,,386,4.260273972602739
8408064,5,B003XF1VSY,I read about this movie in a book called Films of the 1950's.  It took me a long time to see this movie.  Its a perfect film.  All should watch.,1322956800,,144,3.7333333333333334
