1657934,5,B00005RYL0,Was brand new like it said which makes me super happy! My son LOVES dragon tails so when I found this at such a great price I couldn't pass it up and boy am I glad I didn't,1366848000,,172,3.5526315789473686
1657935,3,B00005RYL0,"To be fair, I have only watched one of the 5 episodes on this video, but I didn't get anything in the message that provided a life-lesson related to not giving up, which is why I bought this video in the first place. I'm hoping the other episodes will have a bit more relevant material. But for what it is worth, my son 3.9 year old loves dragons so if for nothing other then entertainment purposes, this suffices just fine.",1349654400,2,424,4.3125
1657936,3,B00005RYL0,"These Dragon Tales are not nearly as good as the newer kids' videos like Dora, Diego and Backyardigans.  They have good messages but I found the voices a bit irritating.  The Spanish soundtrack has some translation errors--not that it isn't correct Spanish but that I think the original meaning of some phrases was misunderstood.  It wasn't as good as I had hoped.",1319673600,2,364,4.838709677419355
1657937,2,B00005RYL0,"The video was fine and it was wonderful to find it years after Dragon Tales went out of production.  We love that show here!
However, it should not have been advertised as having a sticker set with it if that set was long ago used up and would not be sent with the product.  I somehow assumed that, since stickers were mentioned, they would be forwarded as well.  Sorry to say they were not with the video.
Again, we would have been okay with it if we had known that in advance.  But I believe in truth in advertising.",1290729600,,518,4.202020202020202
1657938,5,B00005RYL0,"My four-year-old has loved Dragon Tales since she was 3, and loves watching them over and over. She loves imaginative play such as make-believe, and watching 6-year-old Emmy and her 4-year-old brother Max go off into Dragon Land makes her wish she could do so too!

In ""Dragon Tales - Don't Give Up"", there are 5 episodes, ""Pigment of Your Imagination"", ""Backwards to Forwards"", ""Tails You Lose"", ""Sand Castle Hassle"", and ""Bully for You"". The episodes are linked by 4 songs ""Stretch"", ""Pretend"", ""Touch"", and ""Silly Song"". The theme of these stories is about persevering and not giving up no matter what the obstacle. The audio comes in English and Spanish and the subtitle options are English, French and Spanish.

I highly recommend Dragon Tales for toddlers- preschoolers.",1242777600,2,776,5.0546875
1657939,1,B00005RYL0,"It is a horrible experience that on this VHS there are 10-15 minutes of commercials before the actual ""Dragon Tales"" start. Unlike DVD, you cannot skip these commercials.",1199318400,,170,5.107142857142857

1657941,5,B00005RYL0,"I am not a fan of Dragon Tales, although my daughter is.  This is  one dvd I really love, though.  I love the characters--the kids and Nina and the musicians, and the storyline.  I also love much of the music.  I love what it teaches about music and about making your own fun.  I'm surprised no one else has written a rave review.  This is a great addition to your permanent collection of kids' DVDs.",1129420800,2,400,4.253333333333333
1657942,4,B00005RYL0,"Dragon Tales is a cartoon PBS series produced by the makers of Sesame Street.  It focuses on two kids named Max and Emmy who find a magic dragon scale that allows them to visit Dragonland.
In Dragonland they play with their friends, Cassie, Ord, Zak and Wheezie, and Quetzal.  Each tale focuses on a different topic such a sharing, problem solving, listening, dealing with bullys, etc.  When one of the dragon does something hard or really special, their dragon badge glows.
My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this cartoon, and I must admit that I do too!  We own all three Dragon Tale DVD's.  This DVD has a better format than the ""let's share, let's play"" DVD.  With this DVD, you can choose to play all episodes, choose your own episode, or play the sing alongs.  Each of the five episodes included here play one right after the other.  I gave it four stars instead of five for that reason.  It would have been nice if they had a sing along after each episode so the flow matches that of the TV series.
There is so many imaginative things here that it will be sure to capture any child's attention.  Bottom line:  You can't go wrong with this one for a boy or a girl!",1011312000,14,1168,4.361111111111111

Purchased 3 five episode dvd's for her birthday. She loves it and watches them every day! She is 3. Thanks for carrying it!,1496793600,,262,4.717391304347826

7952813,1,B00005RYL0,"I can't believe PBS tried to do a show like this! By far, one of PBS's weakest animated TV shows. Just a major disappointment! Little kids will find it too silly and questionable, and big kids will find it too cartoonish. I mainly dislike the plot, the songs, the animation, and some of the characters. The two head dragon is the worst character in the whole show, and Emmy and Max are pretty unlikeable as well. The animation is the worst! No other animated PBS show has graphics and animation this bad! It makes no since at all, I just don't get it! This show is not very cute, hilarious, or fun at all. Arthur, Barney, and Between the Lions are more entertaining than this one. The music was the only thing I liked in the whole show. Take my advise and don't even think about watching this show, or you will be disappointed!",1430352000,,827,4.376623376623376

7952815,5,B00005RYL0,"All of my life I wanted to write a novel, however I am a very bad typist. When I discovered Dragon I realized my goal. I wrote my first novel Love and forensics an imprint on life. It is a story of a husband wrongfully imprisoned for a murder he did not commit. His wife searches for the ones who commited this crime all over the world. The novel has recently been published. I owe this to Dragon, I am now on my second novel but am about to purchase a new advanced version of dragon. To Find out more about my novel click onto Love and Forensics on your computer. Thank you very much.
