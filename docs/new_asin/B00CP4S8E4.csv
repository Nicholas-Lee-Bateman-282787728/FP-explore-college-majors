8584226,1,B00CP4S8E4,"First, be aware that this DVD is not endorsed by Avril Lavigne so does not have any original music by her on it.  The whole thing is interviews with friends and fans who no true fan really cares about.  The whole time there is music playing in the background but it is not Avril's.  It is poorly delivered.  There are some interviews/videos from old interviews that Avril did in the past.  Basically, the person who made this movie thought that people would buy just because it has her name and face on it.  It should be titled ""Run Afraid"" and not ""Walk Unafraid"".  Run far away from this video.",1390435200,4,596,4.412844036697248

The transitions are choppy and full of random shots of nothing relevant. The info in here isn't new, the narrator is inexplicably British, there's very little music, and even less of Avril.",1383004800,,343,4.7
