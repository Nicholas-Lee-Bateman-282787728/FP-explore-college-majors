It is advertised as a film, but in reality it is a preview/scene collection. The scenes are gathered from bits and pieces of horror films licensed by the production company, then strung together on a DVD and sold as a movie.",1414368000,4,347,4.4375

8053033,3,B0007WQHIA,"Basically, this is a clipshow of past Full Moon and Charles Band films. I like it, as some of these movies are not yet on DVD. It has clips from the following:

Subspecies

Bloodstone: Subspecies II

Shrieker

Dr. Moreau's House Of Pain

Head Of The Family

The Killer Eye

Vampire Journals

Bleed

Dr. Mordrid (clip's worth the price alone!)

The Dead Hate the Living

The Creeps

Creepozoids

I believe there are a few more.

+ you get the videozones for the older titles.

A great package for those new to Full Moon or horror.

Also recomended:

Boogeymen: The Killer Compilation

When Puppets & Dolls Attack

Aliens Gone Wild!

Subspecies 4: Bloodstor,",1151280000,8,656,4.738738738738738
