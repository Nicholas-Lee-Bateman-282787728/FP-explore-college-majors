5927212,4,B00ELKDDS6,After reading the previous reviews I was expecting the worst movie ever. Not the best movie but far from the worst.,1383609600,6,115,4.523809523809524
5927213,1,B00ELKDDS6,"This is a low budget drama that centers around Bonnie Parker (Ashley Hayes). It starts with her first failed marriage and her love for ""bad boys."" There is significant first person narration from Bonnie as she reads poetry from her diary. Eric Roberts appears as the sheriff who killed the couple. While his role was brief, the film capitalized on it by showing the clip at the beginning and the end. Plot Spoiler: They die.

The film is exceedingly low  budget. It does not show any robberies, just headlines. In fact the money they show is only a partial view of the corners. The one 50 dollar bill corner has a huge 50 and is clearly a modern bill. Gun fire and bullets hitting the vehicle are CG. The acting is fairly sad too.

A more entertaining film (slightly less accurate) would be ""Bonnie and Clyde vs. Dracula.""

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Dressed couple in bed morning after. Some sexual innuendos such as the postman ""delivering big packages in the rear.""",1383436800,7,985,4.64367816091954
5927214,1,B00ELKDDS6,"This movie is not relevant at all.. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen (Worse then ""DUDE WHERES MY CAR"" Yes... It is possible, it is way worse) .  The ending is horrible, the plot is horrible,  the acting is horrible.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  I promise you, you will not enjoy any part of this movie!",1383350400,,316,4.048387096774194
5927215,2,B00ELKDDS6,"awesomely hilarious.  The acting and lighting were normal- however whoever shot this was something else.

My favorite parts actually come from the edit.  They are: The extremely long cutaway to a still image of a revolver over modern day currency, the same stretch of road that was shot in every different angle and cut to make it look different,  the incredibly long plot exposition photo montage, and last but not least the bug on the lens during the love scene.

this movie is wow",1409788800,,483,4.7023809523809526
5927216,3,B00ELKDDS6,Not what I was expecting from a new movie of a Bonnie and Clyde. I thought it would be more up beat and action.,1399680000,,111,3.6666666666666665
5927217,1,B00ELKDDS6,"Like a movie ""black hole,"" where everything associated with the physicality and subsequent experiencing of a regular movie, is collectively sucked into a vortex of incompetence, bent and compressed out of existence, leaving behind an ""anti-movie"" of stunning nothingness. Please skip Bonnie & Clyde: Justified.",1393459200,2,310,5.911111111111111
5927218,1,B00ELKDDS6,This was the biggest waste of $4.32. The acting was on the level of an Elementary School play. Eric Roberts must've been broke or ran out of drugs. Anyway if you like a poorly made movie with awful acting then this one is for you.,1392163200,2,230,4.133333333333334
5927219,1,B00ELKDDS6,"I thought this would be a good movie but I was wrong. I did read a few reviews before watching but I thought that maybe I would like it anyway. This movie is one of the worst low budget films I have ever seen (not all low budget films are bad). I couldn't even watch the whole movie, it was horrible and boring. I feel like I wasted my money on this film. Don't make the same mistake. I feel like Amazon only made the price what it is because people are going to be curious....... It's about the famous Bonnie and Clyde.",1391644800,2,520,4.058252427184466
5927220,1,B00ELKDDS6,This movie has very good actors but it just felt like I was watching something that someone was trying to film for the very first time.,1391385600,,135,4.230769230769231
5927221,1,B00ELKDDS6,Horrible movie. Do not waste your money renting this film.  It is slow and very un-eventful.  Rent the original it is so much better,1391040000,,132,4.458333333333333
5927222,1,B00ELKDDS6,"would not have rented if I knew - was looking for a fun, but dramatic journey with Bonnie and Clyde - this is more like a high school stage play version.",1390262400,,153,3.967741935483871
5927223,1,B00ELKDDS6,The movie just sucked. It's ashamed they were able to us the name Bonnie and Clyde. It was bad acting and just movie quilty. I felt like wasted my money. I didn't even most of it cuase it was that bad.,1390089600,,201,3.926829268292683
5927224,4,B00ELKDDS6,"I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be light-hearted and funny at times.  Some of the actors were really good, but I think the most disappointing actor in the film was Eric Roberts.  It's a shame because he probably got the big bucks and he was not good at all.  The two who played Bonnie and Clyde were good, but I think the actor who played Clyde's brother Buck did an outstanding job and would have been better cast as Clyde.  While this is not an A-list movie, it's definitely worth watching.  It would have been great to have seen more action, but the actors worked well with the script they were given.  I thought it was very enjoyable and have not regretted my purchase of this movie at all.",1389484800,2,706,4.3106060606060606
5927225,2,B00ELKDDS6,"We did not finish watching this movie.  Slow, boring, looked like it had been made on cheap  budget...
Would not recommend.",1387670400,5,123,4.809523809523809
5927226,1,B00ELKDDS6,"this was not factual at all, bad story line, it was more about a love story that probably didn't exist",1387670400,,102,4.15
5927227,1,B00ELKDDS6,B grade movie. Terrible job. Wouldn't recamind to anybody. Guns were fack and sounded like firecrackers and acting was just as bad.,1387324800,5,131,5.0
5927228,1,B00ELKDDS6,Absolute F movie. Poor acting and low budget. No action sceens are portrayed because that would have cost too much money.,1386979200,4,121,4.809523809523809
5927229,1,B00ELKDDS6,"TERRIBLE!! Acting and actors were horrible! Do not spend the money. Turned it off in 10 minutes. Wish I could get my money back on this one!!
This is a 'NO STAR""",1386892800,5,161,4.0625
5927230,1,B00ELKDDS6,"Seriously? This is the lamest Bonnie & Clyde movie ever. Low budget movie doesn't necessarily mean boring and plain. I felt disrespected by the bunch of terrible and predictable slideshows that were supposed to cover the bank robs: same pictures over and over, same clothes... The actors are not bad... in the parts when they let them do some acting!",1386892800,4,350,4.85
5927231,5,B00ELKDDS6,"My Son Stars as Clyde in this movie. He did an awesome job and so did his fellow Actors.
Thank you",1386288000,4,98,3.7142857142857144
5927232,1,B00ELKDDS6,"A very bad B-movie version of the original movie, video and audio are good though. Just a horrible horrible remake.",1385424000,2,115,4.8
5927233,1,B00ELKDDS6,It was a lousy show.  Most of it was just photos flashing on the screen.  i would recommend that no one waist their money on this movie.,1384300800,2,136,4.0
5927234,1,B00ELKDDS6,"The first thing that popped up was location  ...how can anybody get past the location! and then the end, was so far off portraying an almost goofball Tx ranger...long hair???  There is just too much too far off, and again, location, the piney woods of Louisiana???  Really?  What were they thinking?",1383955200,2,299,4.803921568627451
8606667,1,B00ELKDDS6,Poor acting. Tacky music.  Immature camera shots.  Do not waste your time!,1530921600,,74,5.083333333333333

8606671,2,B00ELKDDS6,"Well, it was amusing. I wouldn't call it Bonnie and Clyde ""Barrow Gang"".
I much prefer the Bonnie & Clyde with Dunaway & Beatty and the
entertaining 2013 version with Emile Hirsch & Holliday Grainger,
though I doubt Clyde was a psychic. But eh, that's Hollywood.
This had interesting moments, but didn't really keep my attention,
I felt more like I was watching a High School Play about Bonnie & Clyde.
That's how I can describe the acting for you. Didn't care for the end.
and Eric Roberts as Frank Hamer.... haha. Yep. There you have it.",1438732800,,539,4.56701030927835
8606672,3,B00ELKDDS6,"Enjoyed the original 1967 movie with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway MUCH better.  New isn't always better, and this is positive proof.  But, an interesting story so not something you're going to fall asleep on.  Just barely OK.",1430179200,2,227,4.921052631578948

But in all I think that the actors did ok.

MOST EVENINGS FIND ME SETTLING IN TO TRY TO FIND SOMETHING WORTH VIEWING ON TV...SOMETIMES VITUALLY HOPELESS, SO I FREQUENTLY CHANGE TO A BOOK AND GO ON ABOUT MY BUSINESS. BUT WITH THINGS LIKE THIS AVAILABLE FOR BUY OR RENT, MY EVENINGS IN MAY JUST HAVE A BETTER OUTLOOK. GO THROUGH AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND.  WE ULTIMATELY TAKE THESE UP TO OUR CABIN TO WATCH.
