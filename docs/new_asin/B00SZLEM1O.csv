6998079,5,B00SZLEM1O,"This film demonstrates the karmic unfolding of a man born into privilege in the west and finding his true self in the east.  Like the life of the historical Buddha, the life and journey of Nicholas Vreeland is a beautiful depiction of transformation.",1435363200,2,250,4.813953488372093
6998080,5,B00SZLEM1O,"This documentary just left me speechless, am profoundly moved by the feelings that it provoked inside.
I could not escape this feeling of complete freedom within, this comes through clearly by just watching this man
who has gone through this transformation.  This is film making at it's best.",1433548800,5,292,5.083333333333333

6998083,5,B00SZLEM1O,"This is a very well-made film with, among other things, touching images of HH the Dalai Lama and Rato Rinpoche.  The evolution of Nicholas Vreeland, the film's focus, as he moves from wealthy dandy to dedicated Buddhist monk, shows us the hollowness of worldly living vs. the true richness of Buddhism's vast and profound path.  I highly recommend this film not only for dyed-in-the-robe Buddhists, but for laymen of a creative turn of mind.***",1433289600,3,444,4.986486486486487
6998084,5,B00SZLEM1O,"Insights are rare for a Western person into the workings of Buddhism. But this monk who is and coming from an affluent family chose this area of knowledge and peaceful pursuit. Through his teacher, the Dalai Lama and others was able to capture...literally his process via a camera. Incredible piece of docu-drama. I highly recommend this tape for those on The Path, seekers of Truth and the curious.",1432684800,4,399,4.882352941176471
6998085,5,B00SZLEM1O,"Not much more to say that the previous reviewer hasn't already said, except that this is one of the finest documentaries about one man's search for meaning admidst a life of power and privilege.  Nicholas Veerland's journey from socialite to abbot of an important Buddhist temple, is both fascinating and compelling, well worth the investment of your time.",1431388800,5,356,5.137931034482759
6998086,5,B00SZLEM1O,"What a surprise, this was one of the more fascinating films I have seen. Nicky Vreeland, the son of an Ambassador, grandson of Diana Vreeland, and a scion of the young fashion world, decided thirty odd years ago to become a monk.

The slow, gradual change that propelled Nicky from a photographer to the fashion world to studying Tibetan Buddhism began when he realized something was missing from his world. It was not a dramatic change, he came to a realization that he was looking for some meaning in his life. He met Khyongla Rato Rinpoche, founder of New York's Tibet House, and a teacher to the Dalai Lama. After sometime Buddhism replaced his love of photography. Someone stole all of his cameras, and he said it was freeing in a sense. He moved to India to study at a monastery, the Dali Lama gave him his blessing. In this stark world he dedicated himself to his studies, and he learned the Tibetan language. He had a singular room with a mat, communal living, with Tibetan monks. He spent fourteen years here, and then returned to New York.

The Dali Lama felt Nicky was needed in the West, and Nicky alternates between New York, New Jersey where his mentor, lives and India. His brother gave him a camera and he started taking exquisite pictures of his environment and people he meets. Nicky was very instrumental in the planning and building of a new monastery. The old one was bursting at it's seams with new monks. It was run down and needed replacement. When funding dried up, he sold his photographs. He raised more than $400,000, and the monastery became a reality.

In 2008, the Dali Lama made Nicky Vreeland the Abbot of this new monastery. No Westerner had ever held this title, and we see in this documentary, his family, Monks and the Dali Lama all arrive for the dedication. The Tibetan Buddhism is not explored in full detail. However, the philosophy of peace and love are evident. The Dali Lama is shown several times, laughing and warm to everyone. We also see Richard Gere, a long time friend of Nicky's and the Dali Lami. The rituals and the life of a monk are not simplistic, and as we see Nicky navigate through his life, we see fulfillment. He does mention that he has always loved women, and celibacy is difficult.

 An extraordinary documentary that I found fascinating in the transition from an accomplished fashion photographer, ladies man, to abbot in a Tibet Monastery. A man who has found what he is looking for, and a man who has been successful in his transition.

8699940,4,B00SZLEM1O,"Chronicles the life of a male NYC socialite (his mom was the editor of Vogue) who decides to follow Buddhism. He goes to India and soon there are many others that want to learn. A bigger campus is needed, $s are promised but due to the 2008 financial mess there is not enough $upport.

Since he is a photographer he has exhibits of his work and a book is published to raise $ to complete the project. Richard Gere and His Holiness The Dali Lama appear. Insight into the faith, much bowing.",1460332800,,489,4.315217391304348

8699943,5,B00SZLEM1O,"Very well done - great documentary and insight into who this very interesting character - ""Nicky"" Vreeland - really is, along with insights into his famous family connections contrasted with his vocation to the simple life of a Buddhist monk. It is a great story of recognizing the impermanence of life, the calling to do good for others, and how the once seemingly selfish and vain pursuit of photography can be turned into a selfless act of service to create art for collectors and raise funds for building a monastery in India.",1453593600,,530,4.771739130434782

8699946,5,B00SZLEM1O,"Blown away by Monk With A Camera.  I pitch it wherever I go.  Amazes me that the Spirit reached out and grabbed Nicholas Vreeland by the scruff of his neck and molded him into a viable useful lovable authentic human being.  I talk about him to friends and whomever else will listen as if he's a relative/sweetheart/friend I truly love and respect.  I don't ever have to meet him, or kiss his hem, or think about him.  Am thrilled that he is dedicated to a good cause, the only answer being ""Love Beyond Definition.""  Put another way, I am in thrall that in the midst of the chaos and havoc this world has self-created that there is a Nicholas Vreeland secreted somewhere in this world planting the mustard seeds of goodness, gentleness, kindness, joy, love, fidelity, self-containment, peace, patience, all cosseted in Humility.",1435536000,2,828,4.755244755244755
