The DVD is materfull just like all of the works from this artist!
But my review isn't just about this, it is about Amazon.com. I looked everywhere for this DVD and they were all sold out everywhere,I came to Amazon and they got it for me, I don't know how but they followed thru and I was so pleased, I will always check here first because they mean business and satisfing customers they are the BEST!
Thank You Amazon!
