7442686,1,B015N12S2I,"This dvd is a disappointment in general. For KC fans, this would be the worst dvd if you are trying to re-live the highlight on how the Royals got there. For the first time since 2003 World Series dvd, MLB decided to cover only the World Series instead of showing how each team got there and their history. I hope that the Royals make their own dvd to cover up for this MLB's horrifying mishap.

Royals, please make a dvd like you did in 1985, the Thrill of it all. Maybe this year name it as Thrill of it all II?",1449014400,14,513,4.079207920792079
7442687,4,B015N12S2I,"I just got this yesterday and enjoyed the movie, but I wish it could have been more extensive besides just highlighting the World Series.  Would have loved to have seen some highlights and interviews about the season, and the impact of the Royals winning  seasons have had  on the city. Still I highly recommend this bluray, and hope to get the collectors set that's going to be released on Dec. 8th.",1449014400,7,400,4.605633802816901
7442688,3,B015N12S2I,"Have to admit, a little disappointed in this recap of the great 2015 run that the Royal's put on.  The movie completely skips the entire regular season tear they were on (remember...all the ""experts"" picked them to finish around 4th place)...including skipping the late push to snatch back home field advantage, the incredible LDS comeback drama vs Houston, and the pinpoint dismantling of Toronto in the LCS.  It jumps right into Game 1 of the WS and each of the 5 games is given about a 15min recap.  However, just about every shot and every replay is in slow-mo so after an hour of slo-mo video, some of the punch and excitement is lost.  Part of what made KC such a great team in 2015 is their speed and base running and defense, the impact of which is lost when everything is shown in slo-mo.  But mostly, I was really disappointed that there wasn't at least a 10-20min lead in recap of the season and the other two playoff series', each of which was equally as amazing and exciting.  The Royals pulled off a historic playoff run with so much drama and so many comeback victories just to get back to the WS that I thought they were equally as important to touch on.  Looking back at the ""official WS film"" from other teams' years, this pales in comparison.  Based on their listings...2011 was almost 200 minutes long.  2012 was 90min.  2013 was 86min.  2014 was 111min.  This 2015 film is also listed at 111min but that must count all of the short bonus features too because the actual ""movie"" itself was a paltry 82min.

And also, completely missing are the bonus games, which looks like MLB stopped doing in 2013.  The 2011 and 2012 films at the very least included a full important playoff game along with the World Series recap film.  Better than no bonus stuff at all, right?

Overall, this was an okay recap that I personally didn't feel adequately captured the full breadth of what KC accomplished in 2015.  Can't give it 2 stars because that = ""didn't like it"", which isn't really true.  3 stars = ""just okay"".",1449014400,30,2023,4.526170798898072

7442691,1,B015N12S2I,"No closed caption!  My husband is hearing impaired. He was so excited to watch this movie then realized there was no closed caption. At the very least, Paul Rudds narration should be cc. Very disappointed.",1458691200,,205,4.857142857142857

7442709,3,B015N12S2I,"You done messed up, MLB.  This could have been a great storyline video.  It could of been a story of redemption, of finishing what was started, of record playoff sweeps, only to falter at the finish line, of record voting at the all star game, of mid season acquisitions, of taking the risks and finally getting the reward.  But...it wasn't.

I understand, after such an amazing 2 years of baseball...how could you be expected to top the actual season?!?
I expected you to at least try...",1453334400,3,488,4.6395348837209305

7442714,5,B015N12S2I,"I do not understand the negative comments regarding this film. It is not titled '2015 regular season review'. It's titled '2015 World Series Film'. It's exactly what it says and MLB did a very good job putting the film together. Anyone expecting this to recap the entire season would also have to see the Mets 2015 year in review as well. The is the World Series only.

Learn to read and understand what this film is.",1451606400,2,417,4.4868421052631575
7442715,4,B015N12S2I,"I love the documentary as a fan of the Royals. However I didn't put five stars as I notice that seems that the blue-ray was made with haste and MLB didn't make an effort, even weren't considerate, of the hearing impaired people by no adding closed caption. I was unable to ""listen"" because of the lack of it and wanted to know the testimonies of the players.

Without this feature the disc is not worth more than $20 doesn't matter how good quality is.",1451606400,2,452,4.380952380952381

7442718,3,B015N12S2I,"I don't have cable, but I did watch all the games. Having the ability to switch audio feeds is really cool, and listening to the Mets radio calls at crucial moments was very interesting. My gripe is the post game cuts off after about a minute or two on the blurays. Not sure that happens with the regular DVDs. I wanted to watch those since I never saw them before, and they aren't on YouTube. Bonus disks were pretty good too.",1451347200,2,427,4.283950617283951
