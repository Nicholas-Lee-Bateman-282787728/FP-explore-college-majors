I was okay with price considering these have not been remastered and are in full-screen aspect ratio. However, I would have paid twice the price for a remastered version. Great movies.

2323074,4,B0009UZG46,Dudley Moore is a very good actor - he played his roll very well and very believable. Liza Minnelli was also very good in her roll. Both movies were very  entertaining.,1403481600,,168,4.419354838709677
2323075,5,B0009UZG46,"I got this because it has both  movies 1 and 2 on it. Both are great, funny and sad situations",1403049600,,94,3.7
2323076,5,B0009UZG46,"Dudley Moore at his irresistible best!  I (thankfully) never saw the recent remake of ""Arthur""...which I'm sure couldn't hold a shot glass to this original.  The comment from Arthur's father calling him a ""millionaire drunk playboy"" tells it all, but to me the movie belongs to Sir John Gielgud in the role of Arthur's ""servant"" Hobson.  Some of the best lines are delivered by Sir John, and I won't spoil the surprise by quoting them here.
""Arthur 2 On the Rocks"" is an OK sequel, but doesn't carry the weight of the first.
Packaging was great and delivered prior to the original promised date.  I highly recommend this!!",1397001600,5,622,4.731481481481482
2323077,5,B0009UZG46,"For anyone who needs a good laugh!!!!  It also puts you on a roller coaster ride of emotions as Dudley is having to face the facts of trying to ""Grow UP"". It is well worth a re-watch.",1396656000,,183,3.945945945945946
2323078,5,B0009UZG46,I remember these movies from many years ago.  Can't go wrong with Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli.  Wanted to share the laughter with my grandchildren.  To show them what good movies are.,1394582400,,186,4.75
2323079,3,B0009UZG46,"I remember Arthur being much more fun, the laughs a lot quicker, Dudley Moores character laugh being less annoying.  Nothings as good as the memory of it...I never liked the sequel, it was never funny to me, the only reason I bought it was that by buying the two, the package was cheaper than buying Arthur by itself.  I still enjoyed it, a nice meandering stroll down memory lane, but it isn't the movie I'd watch over and over-like Caddyshack, I could watch that all day long!",1391904000,,478,4.482758620689655
2323080,5,B0009UZG46,Great movie I have watched it over and over and to have both dvd's together is wonderful a great watch and a great price,1387065600,,120,4.041666666666667
2323119,5,B0009UZG46,"I just love these movies! Great feel good, funny, laugh a minute movie to just curl up on the couch and laugh at. Dudley Moore plays a hilarious drunk. I never get sick of hearing, ""He's taking the knife outta the cheese, you think he wants some cheese""? Love, love, love, the butler in ""Arthur"". Dudley and Liza are the perfect pair!",1386720000,,334,4.403225806451613

Thanks Amazon!",1368921600,,181,4.294117647058823
2323123,4,B0009UZG46,Watching these movies makes you realize that MONEY IS IMPORTANT.thats right MONEY is IMportant these days unfortunately..good clean family movie.dudley Moore plays the perfect alcholic. I enjoy movies when actors can act.,1368230400,,221,5.9375
2323124,5,B0009UZG46,"Love these two movies.  tried to tape them both, but could not find them on together so that is why I ordered this DVD double
feature.  I can watch these two movies over and over again.  And I do !!!!",1367452800,,200,3.95

2323166,5,B0009UZG46,Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli are great in both these movies. Arthur was a rich man who never grew up and was very wealthy. Dudley Moore was a great comedian. It's such a shame that he died at an early age. He had so much potential.,1331424000,,233,4.086956521739131
2323167,5,B0009UZG46,"I love Dudley Moore and I absolutely loved Arthur more than any of his other movies.
I hate that they remade it and made a mockery of it.
I am so glad I own the DVDs so that I can always get a good laugh whenever I'm feeling meloncholy.",1325376000,,236,3.836734693877551
2323168,3,B0009UZG46,"Arthur was a pretty funny movie.  I've never seen it before & i enjoyed it.  However Arthur 2 was very, very, VERY boring and we fell asleep during the first 20mins of it.  So I am glad they came together in one pack because i would have wanted my money back for the 2nd one.",1309996800,,275,3.963636363636364
2323169,5,B0009UZG46,This is one of  the best movies ever made. This was the only place  the duo in that I could find in stock. This has always been a favorite of mine and now my son got to see the original.,1305590400,,186,3.625
2323170,5,B0009UZG46,"Dudley Moore is totally outrageous in this role. For me, it is his HALLMARK portrayal of a spoiled rich drunk, who has do deal with reality. The actors and actresses are perfectly cast for these roles, its a if you are on the outside looking in at someone's real life. HOW DARE HOLLYWOOD try to RE-MAKE a classic like this! When you have a 'brilliant cut diamond', why replace it with 'cheap glass' with no class. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THE MOVIES - THIS IS A CLASSIC TO OWN & KEEP !!!!!!!!",1304812800,2,493,4.311827956989247
2323171,3,B0009UZG46,There was a delay in the shipping and when I received it about a 1 inch slice in the back of the movie case. No damage to the actual disk itself. This is a fabulous movie one that I have remembered for years and much better than the new release of Arthur.,1303257600,,255,3.923076923076923
2323172,5,B0009UZG46,Great video set.  Would have been great to have been wide screen but movies didn't come that way in most instances unless they have more recently been re-released.  I received my video in 2 days!,1296777600,,195,4.542857142857143
2323173,5,B0009UZG46,"So i've always been a Dudley Moore fan, and I wanted to buy the classic Arthur before that idiot Russell Brand screws up the franchise by polluting it with vulgar humour and sleazy sex jokes (at least more vulgar and sleazy than the original).  Dudley Moore just brings a level of class and sophistication and even sympathy to everyone's favorite drunken playboy!",1268179200,14,363,4.854838709677419
2323174,5,B0009UZG46,This is really an excellent value for the price.  Dudley Moore and Liza Minelly are outstanding!  These shows keep you laughing and wanting more.  Dudley Moore plays the best rich boy with a drinking problem I've ever seen......totally convincing.  An excellent comedy!!,1266451200,2,270,5.357142857142857
2323204,5,B0009UZG46,"WE JUST LOVE THE ""ARTHUR MOVIES"" WE WERE THRILLED TO FIND THEM ON AMAZON......WE ARE ENJOYING THEM SO MUCH...I RECOMMEND THEM TO EVERYONE...GREAT!",1265328000,,146,5.391304347826087
2323205,5,B0009UZG46,"Hail to Dudley Moore! He could be funny, charismatic, clever, sensitive, romantic and talented.  These two movies highlight all of this and more. He must have been very self-assured. No camera tricks or leading ladies standing in trenches to make him seem taller.  It was never questioned by movie-goers why the statuesque leading ladies would choose him over the tall handsome hunks.  Who could resist his wit and debonair charm.  Gone too soon; but living on in celluloid memories. Kudos to Liza Minnelli! Her wide-eyed kookiness and sensitivity act as a perfect foil to Dudley's ""poor little rich man"" in these films.",1255305600,3,620,5.049019607843137
2323206,4,B0009UZG46,"Arthur is a classic movie and most people will thoroughly enjoy it. Dudley Moore is superb - but John Gielgud is better!  'Arthur' is a first rate movie and, by itself, Arthur fully deserves 5 stars.

Sadly, the same can't be said of 'Arthur 2'. In spite of this being almost a rehash of 'Arthur' - which, as I said, was an excellent movie - I give it 4 stars because it is still very funny...........in places. However, the script is too predictable and the acting undistinguished - with the notable exception of John Gielgud who excels naturally.  (John Gielgud could gain a deserved Oscar, for reading his breakfast Corn Flakes packet!)

Those who thoroughly enjoyed Arthur, will enjoy the sequel movie - but don't expect any real 'class' to emerge - other than from Gielgud!",1245715200,3,778,4.698529411764706

2323209,5,B0009UZG46,"For the price this is definately worth it. It comes on 2 discs in one case, a must have for comedy fans like me. Dudley Moore is at his best in these to classic 80's comedy hits. This is a plus considering that it's on 2 discs and not on the single 2 sided disc that seems to get scratched all the time and you have to decide which side of the disc you want to keep in good mint condition.",1237852800,21,389,3.814814814814815
2323210,5,B0009UZG46,"Classic comedy in a great DVD 2 pack!!! Includes the classic ""Arthur"" (in Standard Full Frame) and the equally great sequel ""Arthur 2: On The Rocks""(in 1.85 Anamorphic Widescreen). Great acting from the late Dudley Moore,along with stellar performances by Liza Manelli,and John Gielgud. If you want great classic comedy,you cant go wrong with this Arthur 2 pack!!! Some might gripe about the original in Standard Full Frame,that's a monor quibble here since the film was shot close to ""flat"" anyway. Recommended! A GREAT PRICE FOR BOTH FILMS ON DVD!!!

8067047,5,B0009UZG46,My mom has talked about this movie for as long as I could remember. I finally found it here and gave it to her as an early birthday gift. She was so excited we watched both dvds that night. She loved them they didn't skip once. The packaging was horrible and the insert for Arthur 2 was completely broke off in the case. I'm still giving it 5 stars because she enjoyed watching them and no skipping.,1498348800,,399,4.194805194805195
