4659202,5,B005DEUF0S,Ordered  for Christmas for my nephew who is total  DBZ nut! Needed both Season One and Two to complete his  collection,1355443200,,118,4.523809523809524
4659203,4,B005DEUF0S,"To understand kai, I have to talk to you about the original dragon ball Z. I'have seen all the original dragon ball Z episodes and now i'm watching the KAI version. What I can say is when I was watching the original, I really liked it but it was too long, too much filler and waiting for something to happend. As good as it could be, I had not the will or the energie to watch the whole serie a second time as it was. Furthermore, I wanted to introduce my girlfriend to the dragon ball z world but if like her you are not a die hard fan, the original version is just too much.

Now, the kai version is just great. I'm not that far into it but I can say that It make me want to watch Goku and all the Z fighter again. The pace is perfect and I don't miss any of the cut they have made so far. They decided to be closer to the manga, so that version is the closes you can get from the original author vision. That version could be appreciate by a lot of anime fan (who aren't DBZ fan). The only draw back for me is that they have stopped after cell Saga. No blu-ray version goes farther than that. That why I have removed 1 star.",1347062400,3,1127,3.921397379912664
4659204,3,B005DEUF0S,"Dragon Ball Z Kai (which is known as Dragon Ball Kai in Japan) is a re-working of the first 194 episodes of Dragon Ball Z that was produced to commemorate the series' twentieth anniversary.  When this series was produced, it was done in a way to remove much of the content in the original series that was not featured in the original manga.  Also, the series also includes a remastered high definition picture, sound, special effects, and a re-recorded voice track with most of the original voice actors.

By removing the extra material that had been added to the original anime series, the story in Dragon Ball Z Kai goes at a much more natural pace, and doesn't feel nearly as stretched out as the original series.  The material that is included in the first twenty-six episodes of Dragon Ball Z Kai is covered in the first fifty-four episodes of the original Dragon Ball Z series.

The Dragon Ball Z Kai Season One box set includes four DVDs that contain the first twenty-six episodes of the series.  The first and third discs contain seven episodes, while the second and fourth discs contain six episodes and bonus features.  When you see the menus on the discs, it's obvious that all FUNimation did to put this box set together was to combine the Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part One and the Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part Two box sets into one set, since the discs are labeled ""Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part One, Disc One,"" ""Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part One, Disc Two,"" ""Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part Two, Disc One,"" and ""Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part Two, Disc Two.""

The extras on disc two contain a textless version of the opening song, a textless version of the closing song, and trailers.  The two textless songs that appear on this disc have the credit text removed, but you can still see the logo, as well as the subtitle text if you watch them with the subtitles on.

The extras on disc four contain three versions of the textless opening, the same textless closing that appears on disc two, and trailers.  The first two textless openings are labeled as ""DVD Version 1"" and ""DVD Version 2.""  When I watched both of these textless openings, I really couldn't tell any difference between them; my guess is that there's some kind of really minor change in the video images, where if you blink, you'll probably miss it.  The other textless opening is the ""Broadcast Version,"" which is the version used when the series airs on American television.  Personally, I thought the lyrics for this English version were weaker, and I didn't personally care for the singer.

One of my biggest disappointments with this set is the fact that there is no marathon feature.  I really appreciated having this feature when I watched the DVD box sets for the original Dragon Ball series, the ""orange brick"" releases of Dragon Ball Z, and the box sets for Dragon Ball GT; it made it so much easier to watch several episodes in a row in one sitting.  However, as an upside, you get to see the next episode previews at the end of each episode, which you didn't get to see on the releases for the other series.

Dragon Ball Z Kai is a decent series, although I'm disappointed that the decision was made in Japan to not include to Majin Boo saga in this project, since that's a story arc that really could have benefited from getting the ""Kai"" treatment.  I would recommend this release to Dragon Ball fans who must own every Dragon Ball DVD release on the market, to viewers who want to be able to watch Dragon Ball Z without the long and drawn-out story arcs, as well as to fans who are familiar with Dragon Ball Z Kai from seeing the series when it aired on American television.

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD box set that I checked out through the King County Library System.",1334016000,5,3752,4.505899705014749
4659205,5,B005DEUF0S,"Here we go again! Another Season One Release for Dragon Ball Z Kai. Why you ask? Simply because Funimation, American Distributor, messed up the first release of this season. In March 2011 a scandal broke out regrading the Original Musical Score for the Show composed by Kenji Yamamoto. Shortly after Kenji's score for the show was completely removed and replaced with the Original Dragon Ball Z score by Shunsuke Kikuchi. With this issue the original release date for Dragon Ball Z Kai Part 5 was pushed back. When it was released the set contained the replaced score.

As expected Funimation dished out the ""Season Sets"" for the show, most likely to replace the ""Parts sets"", with the release of ""Dragon Ball Z Kai Season One"" back in October 2011. Season One was was released to replace Dragon Ball Z Kai Parts 1 & 2, but with the Shunsuke Kikuchi musical score. However shortly after it's release many who bought the product found that the set did not contain the Shunsuke Kikuchi, but still containing the Kenji Yamamoto score despite indicating on the back of the box that it would have the replaced score. After many re-stocks and call backs from the product it was obvious that Funimation had clearly messed up the release and therefore have no choice but to re-release the product, again, but with the replaced score.

To put it simple this product is a re-release of last years Dragon Ball Z Kai Season One, but this time, now confirmed, containing the replaced Shunsuke Kikuchi score.

Funimation has been throwing around Dragon Ball Z releases for years from Volume sets to those hopefully forgotten Orange bricks sets. So what makes this new release any different from the rest?

Well this isn't the original Dragon Ball Z TV Show but a ""Refreshed"" edition of the show. Dragon Ball Z Kai takes to the vision of the Manga. Kai brilliantly removes all the filler from the original TV Show allowing a more faster and action packed story. For example the Garlic Jr Arc has been removed as it was not in the manga. Not only that but the show is presented in a Full HD 1080p resolution with a complete dirt clean up giving it a whole new viewing experience.

One of the main attractions in Dragon Ball Z Kai can be found in it's newly recorded Dialogue for both the Japanese and English versions. As we all know the Japanese dialogue for Dragon Ball Z was recorded between 1989 - 1996 which resulted in a poor mono audio quality. With Kai, most of the original cast have returned to record using modern recording equipment allowing a more crisp and clearly audio recording. The Japanese track is presented in Stereo on both DVD and Blu-Ray. For the English version, fans are treated to a more faithful Dub, accurately translated from the Japanese scripts unlike the English Dub for Dragon Ball Z. There have been many re-casts and voice acting has improved greatly giving the show a much more enjoyable experience when viewed in the English language. The English language track is presented in 5.1 on both DVD and Blu-Ray.

A minor issue, that may affect the more hard core fans, is this release does not have the original Japanese opening and closing credits, as well as the Japanese Title cards. All these are presented in the English format with no second angle to present them in Japanese. Although this may be a downer for a few this does not affect the overall viewing experience.

Overall this is simply the original Dragon Ball Z TV Show edited down to suit the original story arc telling of the Manga. It features a complete image clean up in a 4:3 aspect ratio with newly recorded voice tracks, both Japanese and English version, with the replaced musical score composed by Shunsuke Kikuchi. The show is fast paced and full of action, perfect for devoted and new fans alike!

4659206,3,B005DEUF0S,"Like many long time Dragon Ball fans out there, I've had mixed feelings about DB Kai as a whole. I would say if you've not experienced the original animation then this is a good place to start loving the show (especially for those whose attention is rather short). It cuts out large sections of what some have dubbed ""filler"" to try and copy the original set-up of the manga more closely. And this is my main problem with the concept of Kai in general. I love the anime as it originally came out just as I love the manga as it originally was. They are two separate pieces of art not really made to be a perfect copy of each other. That said, I will give credit where it is do for the updated musical score, and must say I am looking forward to when they release the OST for Kai here in the States. Though I would also caution here that some of the music has become more ""upbeat"" where it once might have had a darker key-set to it.",1318464000,5,931,4.149171270718232
4659207,5,B005DEUF0S,"This review refers to the original 2011 edition.

Funimation has been throwing around Dragon Ball Z releases for years from Volume sets to those hopefully forgotten Orange bricks sets. So what makes this new release any different from the rest?

Well this isn't the original Dragon Ball Z TV Show but a ""Refreshed"" edition of the show. Dragon Ball Z Kai takes to the vision of the Manga.

The show runs for a total of 98 episodes finishing off at the end of the Cell Games.

One of the main attractions to the English version of this show is it's Dub. The English Dub keeps strict to the Japanese Dialogue and story unlike the English version of Dragon Ball Z. Not only does the English version contain a shiny new dub but the Japanese version has also been re-recorded. However the English Dub is presented in Dolby True HD 5.1 whereas the Japanese version is Dolby True HD 2.0

It should be noted that this Season Set uses  Kenji's Yamamoto's Score despite indicting on the box Shunsuke Kikuchi's Score.

So for people who want to see a fast paced Dragon Ball Z in High Definition with a true to the script English Dub then this is the set for you.

UPDATE 20th February 2012

Funimation have now announced a Second release for this Product, releasing on 22nd May 2012. Therefore this version will be discontinued in favour for the Re-Release. It is likely to contain the same Boxart but with the Shunsuke Kikuchi.
Here is the DVD version here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Ball-Kai-Season/dp/B0079KGAN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Ball Kai Season</a>

4659208,5,B005DEUF0S,"Definitely worth the while if you are new to dragon ball z kai. First thing to point out is this set contains 26 episodes of dragon ball z kai uncut in there full glory. This set will contain the orginial japanese music used Dragon Ball Z, I'm talking about Shinsuke Kikuchi's score. There is no Yamamoto music on these sets. I'm actually glad these contain the original music composed by Shinsuke used in DBZ, that way the music will be complete on these sets and we will not have to worry about any more music scandels.

I also want to point out that I'm reviewing this before the set has actually come out yet but I will update this review once the set is released and actually list what comes with the product but I can give you quesses on what to expect.

First, I think there will be 4 blu ray discs each running around about 6-7 episodes a piece.
But something else to point out is the series clocks around 98 episodes so these sets will not always 26 episodes.

My Season Sets Prediction

Season 2(May contain part 4's cover): Episodes 27-52(26 episodes)
Season 3(May contain part 6's cover): Episodes 52-78(26 episodes)
Season 4(May contain Gohan SSJ2....): Episodes 79-98(20 episodes)

This is a really early prediction so we will have to wait until the series actually ends in North America. But if you are new to dragon ball z kai and you are curious about it, then this is the set of sets for you. By the time I have written this review the price of this set on blu ray is at a whopping $38.49 but I am pretty sure Amazon will drop the price to make it much affordable as the weeks move on closer to release date. Once again I will upadate this review once more details are announced including packaging information.",1313107200,,1729,4.441640378548896
4659229,5,B005DEUF0S,"Im finally getting around to buying DBZ, and though some people are not fans of Kai, I completely enjoy it as much as I did the original. I also love the fact that the Blu-Ray copy can be found cheaper than the DVD copy, making it easier to obtain the best quality for this show. About the show itself, all I can say is ""KAAA-MEEE-HAAAA-MEEEE-HAAAAAAAAAA!!!!"" *yells as hands are placed in blasting stance*",1499299200,2,406,4.575342465753424

4659261,5,B005DEUF0S,"A lot of people are very confused about this series. I just wanted to go over the positives of why someone would want this series over the other offerings.

1. The artwork is true to the original. They did not try to change the colors or cut the image to make it widescreen, like other popular offerings. It is true 4:3 where you can see every detail on the screen. The colors are accurate, whereas other offerings alter them to try and make them look so-called ""better."" I'm a fan of keeping things the way they're supposed to be. But with that in mind, it still enhances the quality while maintaining these things.

2. The dialogue is much more accurate. This goes for the English voice acting, which was incredibly inaccurate in past offerings, but also for the subtitles. They really took some care into making sure you're getting the true story. You can get by without having accurate dialogue for most things, but there are parts that change what you think about how things work. For instance ""Instant Transmission"" (Instantaneous Movement for actually translation) in older English voice acting explained it as moving at the speed of light. The correct translation is that he actually teleports instantly to another location. There is not movement involved.

3. This version stick to the manga. Many parts of the anime series did not have to do with Akira Toriyama. They were created by other staff and added to lengthen, and in some people's opinions add extra entertainment to, the anime series. This version will help you understand what is actually fact in Akira Toriyama's story. If you are interested in getting the story as the creator made it to be, this is it. Some filler can actually make the story less understandable as to how the character's behave.

There is one major flaw to the English offering: It does not include the Buu saga. They did have this saga available in Japan, but decided to scrap the project before the final saga for the English offering. It is a huge kick in the balls. When you search the topic, you find a lot of clues that they might be finally working on it again. Will be incredibly exciting if we get a Season 5. Then we might finally get a box set for all of the seasons together and it won't be looked down upon anymore as a failed series in English.",1467331200,2,2300,4.602439024390244

4659264,5,B005DEUF0S,"If you're trying to get into DBZ or are already a fan of it, this is perfect for you. I was weary about watching this because it's very different from the original and i knew things were cut out but it's such a great watch and I prefer it to the original. Many unnecessary parts were cut out and we're left with a version filled with action, character development, and little to no filler in episodes. My biggest complaint for this is that there are some scenes that were animated in and they're distracting because they're in a very different style(if you've seen the newest DBZ movies then you know what I'm talking about).",1459296000,,625,4.491228070175438

It would have all 5 stars if they didn't miss such a huge part of the show, considered the opening song is like 3 minutes long and is played before every episode. Also, the subtitles do not match at all, I enjoy watching TV with subtitles on in case I miss something, but with them being so different it's actually quite distraction from the show. I don't know if something was lost in translation but they could have at least matched it to what the actors were saying.",1449878400,,609,4.446428571428571

4659286,4,B005DEUF0S,"FUNimation has done a great job with the re-dub on their end, and the edits made to cut out most of the filler make for a much more briskly-paced, watchable series. That said, DBZ struggled a bit in its first season, with some outrageously bad dialogue and gigantic plot holes (even by Dragon Ball standards).  I forgot how cringe-worthy Goku's unflappable naivety can be to my Western sensibilities (releasing Raditz and Vegeta, for example), and a lot of Piccolo's behavior doesn't make much sense, either.  But you don't watch DBZ for deep, thought-provoking drama.  I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the Dragon Ball Z Kai series.

Technically speaking, the Blu-ray adds nothing noticeable to the picture quality, but the high capacity discs do manage to pack quite a few more episodes on each disc than their DVD counterparts.  The menus are fine but I wish there was an ability to ""binge watch"" each episode consecutively without having to manually skip through every title card, intro / end credits musical number, and ""Last time on Dragon Ball Z Kai"" / ""Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai"" capsules.  (If you're watching with someone who has never seen the series before, I highly recommend skipping the ""Next time"" segments, because they contain MAJOR spoilers.)",1441152000,,1274,4.929906542056075

However, there is one major flaw for me. If you love and prefer the new Kenji Yamamoto score, then this will break your heart. Due to Kenji being fired, his score has been replaced with Shunsuke Kikuchi's original score from Dragon Ball Z. If you strive to watch DBZ Kai with Yamamoto's score, look for the individual volume DVDs and not the Season Box Sets. All in all, it is a fine show to check out.",1438300800,,578,4.411214953271028

4659333,5,B005DEUF0S,"Well what can I say that others haven't ... This fixes nearly all that was wrong with dragonball z ... But not all . The dragonball z that aired around the late 90s to 2006 was a great show with an awsome soundtrack and great characters . But it had filler that dragged on forever . The voice acting could be cringe worthy at times and the dialouge could be very cheesy . Well with dragonball z kia they cut out most filler so now that it's more true to the manga . This really helps the story flow in a more cohesive fast way and is actually much easier to just pick up and watch . Now I really liked some of the filler in the original show but it dragged things on and some things never even got resolved or went anywhere . Now on too the voice acting well for the most part everyone really brings there A game it certaintly is an improvement . Although gohan and Burma have new voice actors/actresses they really good once you get used to them . The dialouge is improved tremindiously , everything sounds so much more down to earth and real . With them actually cussing and what not . Which also is much more true to the manga . Another thing is that they redesigned certian shots which look really good in my opinion . And the picture is its original aspect ratio instead that cropped stuff we got last time . There is one thing im kinda iffy on and it's the japenese soundtrack . I mean it's pretty good but bruce faulconers original score will always be amazing and the definitive score to me . But there are some tracks on this version i really do like . All in all i say buy dragonball z kia on blu ray/dvd it's well worth your money is your fan . And is your not just check it out on adult swim . Also even check out the original dbz it's still a great show and is worth a watch .",1426636800,2,1789,4.070821529745042

The animation is perfect, being remastered and improved overall from the old days. The majority of the filler has been removed, condensing the series and making it easier to follow, and more importantly, keeping the focus on the action. But one fatal flaw ruins Kai for me - the lack of Bruce Falconer's superior American score. Bruce Falconer's music made the English dub of DBZ vastly superior to the Japanese version in terms of music. Listening to the horrible Japanese music kills the intensity of the scenes and draws the viewer out of the show and looking for the mute button on their remote. Stick to the regular DBZ Season sets and skip any episodes you don't like. The terrible music is a deal breaker.",1417996800,5,840,4.644295302013423

I mean Gohan sounds like a little girl! Bulmas new voice is obnoxious as hell & not even close to the original.. and as far as the ""no filler"" goes well lets just say its not the same DBZ story I grew up watching now. I'm sorry but I watched DBZ and didn't read the manga so I don't care about the show being exactly the same as the manga. The garlic Jr saga is actually really cool, gohan, krillin and piccolo handle a bad Guy all by themselves without goku!

 DBZ Done Right!!!",1405468800,,37,4.142857142857143
4659351,5,B005DEUF0S,"It arrived about a week ago.  I just finished watching all four seasons today.  Wow, what an enjoyable experience.  As far as my familiarity with the series goes, I followed Kai during it's original Japanese broadcast, and I also saw some of the Saiyan arc on Nicktoons.  So it's been about 3 years since I last watched Kai.  This is my first time watching Kai with Shinsuke Kikuchi's score.  I have always been a huge fan of Dragon Ball Z, having become hooked as a youth during its Toonami days.  I have owned various versions of the original series for some time now.  I recently started following the Japanese broadcast of the Buu Saga, and that reignited my interest in the series.  So I decided to purchase all four seasons of Kai, and I have to say I couldn't have been more happy with these releases.

The picture is beautiful and vibrant, as much softer colors were used in its restoration.  The video has two black bars on the side of the image to fit a 16:9 TV, while still keeping the series in its correct 4:3 aspect ration.  Some may dislike that, but I personally prefer it.  I find that when you stretch the image to fit the full 16:9 AR, quality is lost.  When you crop the image, you obviously lose parts of the image.  So 4:3 is perfect to me because that is the way the series was truly meant to be seen.  You get the entire image in high definition.  My only gripes with Kai concern some of the reanimated scenes.  Many of them were just flat out ugly, and would have looked better if they were recolored in the same manner as most of the other scenes.  But that's a minor complaint.

The audio is great as well.  The dub by all accounts is fantastic.  I prefer the Japanese audio, so I strictly watch the series with the Japanese audio.  I must say that Funi's subtitles for the series were exceptional, and far more accurate than the fansubs I would watch a couple years ago.  As I mentioned, this was my first time watching Kai with Kikuchi's score.  As someone who enjoyed Kenji Yamamato's score, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed the placement of Kikuchi's score for this rendition.  Although his music was arranged differently than it was in Z, the songs chosen usually worked with their particular scene.  I enjoyed Kikuchi's score so much, that I now find myself a little disappointed in the score they are currently using for the Buu saga.

Now, to discuss the content.  I absolutely love Kai, and I am ready to take the leap and say that it is now my preferred way of watching the series.  When I first popped in the discs, I suspected that I would end up skipping straight to the fight scenes, as I often do with Z.  But after playing episode 1, I found myself watching entire episodes in sequence.  Before I knew it, I was having marathon sessions daily.  Now here I am, a week later, writing a review after going through all 98 episodes.  The pacing is so much better than Z, and much more accurate to the Manga.  I forgot how fluid the series was.  I even went through the Dragon Books in my Dragon Box to look over the episodes.  I was shocked to realize how much longer it took to get through certain phases of the series.  I'm no longer sure how I watched the entire series with such enthusiasm as I did back then, considering how unbearably long some arcs now seem.  But that is the effect Kai has had on me.  Arcs such as the Namek arc, seem much more watchable now.  I mean think about it.  The Cell arc ends at episode 98 of Kai, and episode 194 of Z (If I'm correct).  So that means of the first 194 episodes of Z, 96 episodes worth consisted of filler material.  That just seems like such a ridiculous number, in retrospect.

In my opinion, Kai is a must have for all fans of the series.  I know some still love the original, filler and all.  I still love Z, as well, and will watch it from time to time.  But Kai has certainly won me over.  It is certainly not without its flaws, and it is executed poorly in some instances.  It probably would have been better had Toei chose to reanimate the series completely, as they did the opening and ending sequences, as well as the eye catchers.  However, I can still appreciate the series for what it attempted to do.  That is to show Z in a true-to-the-manga director's cut.  Again, things could have been done better.  But I still consider it good enough.  That's enough of my rambling.  However, I want to make it clear that Kai has my stamp of approval, and I would recommend it to fans both new and old.",1404950400,9,4511,4.342925659472422
4659352,5,B005DEUF0S,"I am a ridiculous Dragon Ball fan, and my favorite moments of the series are right around when King Piccolo appears in Dragon Ball  up until the end of the Frieza saga. That places DBZ Kai Season 1 directly in the middle of this, and it just so happens to be that its no slouch.

The quality of the DVDs are great, while there are few extras, there are quite the number of episodes on each disc. The best part is that with all of the filler removed and the script staying more accurate to the Dragon Ball manga, I was finally able to get my wife to watch my second favorite anime of all time (favorite is Yu Yu Hakusho- we *love* Yu Yu). I've been with this woman for over a decade, now, and I was never able to get her to watch this show simply because she thought it was nothing but people shouting at each other and powering up episode after episode- she has been watching the whole of Season 1 with me and this, combined with Dragon Ball Z Abridged, has thoroughly entertained her and she even *gasp* enjoys it! Well, she enjoys Abridged more than Kai, but let's be honest: TeamFourStar is amazing and even if you haven't watched the series, if you're watching it with someone who has then they can explain any jokes you don't get.

Kai is shaping up to be one of my favorite iterations of DBZ yet, as one of my least favorite things about the anime is that there was a ludicrous amount of filler episodes not originally shown in the manga (episodes that were done for the sole purpose of letting the manga catch up to the anime, as the episodes were produced at a faster rate than the monthly manga chapters), and I disliked almost all of them save one during the Android saga where Goku and Piccolo learn how to drive. Losing those episodes loses nothing from the story, and DBZ is far, far better off for it, at least in my opinion. It was like a brand new show, to me, and this is coming from a guy who watched the original series on Cartoon Network, low-quality eBay discs, the orange sets, read the entirety of the manga (twice!) and is now watching Kai. Seriously, Kai, ignoring the terrible intro and outro theme songs, is severely good in picture quality, sound and pace. Some of the new voices take some getting used to, but they're by no means bad and nothing to dishearten those who have never experienced DBZ before.

If you've yet to experience one of the best anime of all time, I'd say this is the way to start- Kai Season 1 is worth your time if you like shonen anime.",1403654400,2,2489,4.300639658848614

Other than that, you don't really need to say much else about this show, everyone's seen it, they know it's great. The video quality here is fantastic, there was a lot of work put into cleaning up the animation. There's actually a lot of small sequences that have been completely re-animated. As for the disks themselves, they leave a bit o be desired. For starters, they left out the Marathon feature from the Dragon Ball 1987 DVDs. This allows you to play the opening song once, and then it just plays all the episodes right after another. And, I hate that none of these Dragon Ball releases have any special features.

4659359,5,B005DEUF0S,"I have been a fan of DBZ since I first watched it as a young kid 20+ years ago.  I have always wanted to rewatch it, but there were two reasons that kept me from doing so, especially when it first came to US television over a decade ago.
1.  I simply did not like the American version, especially the voice acting and music.  While this comes down to personal preference, I didn't feel like the guitar riffs fit the series very well, and in terms of voice acting, Frieza went from a cold, sadistic monster to a raspy old lady.  I just couldn't take it seriously.  Again, this comes down to personal preference, but the inclusion of the original music, along with the new recording by the old Japanese voice actors, is a welcome addition.  The US version had also been heavily cut for TV and was poorly translated.  They have released the uncut version before, but this version has better translation.
2.  I didn't like the filler.  This time, it has been cut out and follows the manga more closely.  This is important for me because I don't have as much time anymore, so this gives me the opportunity to rewatch the series without watching 10-12 drawn out episodes waiting for Goku to make his way on Snake Way.  If you haven't watched the series before, you may want to skip DBZ Kai and watch it in its entirety, but if you don't like filler, this is the version for you.

One of the things I don't like about this release is the omission of the original theme and prologue music from its original state.  The trumpet in the prologue music was a staple of the series that really made it memorable.  It's not a huge deal but it really would have made the overall experience complete.

Overall, I'd recommend this for people who only really care about the storyline and for its adherence to its original roots (minus some of the music).",1385856000,6,1835,4.435820895522388

4659366,5,B005DEUF0S,"Dragon Ball was a big part of my early youth. As so, when I heard about Kai I was overjoyed! I had gotten very rusty on my Dragonball, and this would be a great way to 're experience it. I had Sen the Kai broadcasting on Nicktoons, and since things have changed a lot since then, censorship has a tighter grip, which is a shame. I've heard a lot of people complain about the show simply because of this broadcast, seeing absolutely nothing more to it. To those people: you don't know Kai until you've seen it uncut. As much as I enjoyed Z, it was something you REALLY had to have been following to care about a given show, considering it was a lot of talk and filler. You couldn't just watch any episode. Kai all but gets rid of filler, creating an overall more enjoyable show. Another thing I noticed was the greatly improved quality: the music, the SFX, the animation is all leagues ahead of it predecessor. It feels a little more natural. Another improvement is voice acting. The actor's roles in this redub sound so much more natural, almost as if they hardly are acting. Some roles have been recast, much to many fan's displeasure. Honestly, I feel these people are blinded by nostalgia. The few recasts there are all do superb jobs. The two main changes are Gohan and Freeza. As much as I respect Linda Young, I've never been terribly fond of her Freeza. I always felt less engaged in his evil and more occupied convincing myself this villain is a man. Z's Gohan never seemed quite right to me either. The voice was really raspy, making it sound less like a hero and more villainous. Chris Aryes' Freeza sound chilling, menacing, and very in-laws, which really adds to the performance. Clinkenbeard's Gohan seems more like a child and young teen in voice range as well. Overall, if you want the true DBZ, Kai is your best option.",1374710400,2,1835,4.497005988023952

Both of them want me to pull my ears off my skull. Is like if nails on a chalk board could form words and spend all the time complaining. The voice for Kid Goku/Gohan is one of my favorites in the series and it is really a deal breaker.

So I bought the rest of the Orange Box sets instead. Best version of the show you can possibly get. I believe its even more high definition than the Kai Blu-Ray but that might be from my PS3 up scaling. The filler is monotonous at times and the dialogue changes in Orange Box are pretty bad but I watch it with subtitles and seeing the dialogue differences is fun for me,

4659369,5,B005DEUF0S,"Look, I LOVE the original DBZ (and Dragon Ball, though this is primarily about DBZ./DBZ Kai). I watched it all the time on Toonami way back in the day, played with the action figures, played the video games, had some old VHS tapes, and a few years ago I got the orange bricks (not the best remastering, but it overall fit my needs). However, as much as I love the original DBZ (and my DBZ fix was coming up again), I knew I needed a fresh change. As much as I love the Funimation English dub of DBZ, I've got to put some nostalgia aside and admit that it wasn't always the best. The acting was shoddy at times and the scripts (often changed from the original manga) could range from cheesy to downright terrible. Based on everything I had heard/seen from DBZ Kai, it looked exactly like the fix I needed. Not only was it a ""new"" version of DBZ that would feel fresh, but it would perhaps give me my fix and even more.

I am thrilled to say that I was right. [NOTE: This is not the edited version of Kai that aired on Nicktoons. This is the UNCUT version of DBZ Kai that contains blood and swearing.] DBZ Kai is exactly what I wanted and more. First of all, I have the say that the script is WAY better than that of the dub I grew up with. It is manga-accurate and never has those cheesy, cornball moments that the other English dubs have had. Also, considering that they have had 10 years of voice-acting experience, the English actors (mostly the same with a few changes) are absolutely superb this time around. Sean Schemmel completely embodies Goku, as does Chris Sabat as Vegeta and Piccolo (the voices are actually completely distinguishable from each other now). Everyone else is great as well. The main changes I can think of are for Gohan (voiced by Colleen Clinkenbeard) and Bulma (forgot her voice actor's name). These voices have had a largely negative reaction from those like myself who are familiar with the other voices. First of all, with Bulma, while I might prefer Bulma's old voice (it suited her confident, adventurous, sometimes bubbly personality more), I think her new voice works just fine. Her new voice is perfect for the brainy, know-it-all side of the character, as well as her intimidating side (like when she's with Gohan and Krillin on the way to Namek). So I can definitely say I'm happy with her voice. As for Gohan, contrary to public opinion, I LOVE his new voice. While I've always loved Stephanie Naldolny (his old voice actor) as Kid GOKU, I felt like her voice was always too old and too confident sounded for Kid Gohan. This Gohan actually sounds like a 4-5-year-old kid. The whinyness is there when it needs to be, and the rage is perfectly expressed. I can't help but feel people are complaining mainly because it's not the Gohan voice they're used to, despite that it absolutely fits the character.

The other BIG draw of Kai is that it (for the most part) completely cuts the filler (or things added to the anime that weren't in the manga). Look, I'm nostalgic for the filler; heck, I even sometimes enjoy watching it. However, Kai cuts all the fluff and tells the story as it is meant to be told, and in my opinion, the whole thing feels more epic that way. Also, the series is much faster paced. There are no more extremely drawn out power-ups or staring contests. It gets straight to the action, and I LOVE that.

I'm also a fan of the way the animation has been cleaned up. The colors have also been brightened, and it looks fantastic. The opening and ending credits (different from before) are also really good once you get used to the new songs (Dragon Soul and Yeah! Yeah! Break! Care!, both which I now love). In my opinion, they completely capture the tone of the show, although I can't help but miss Cha-La-Head-Cha-La. Also, Kai contains new eyecatches, or little animations that pop up in the middle of each episode (like an intermission). While the original DBZ had only two eyecatches for the entire series (one for the Saiyan through Cell Sagas and one for the Buu saga), Kai has a different eyecatch depending on what is happening in the episode). This is actually a cool touch and it makes Kai feel like a fresh new show. The only downside to it is that for those new to the show, they might give away details about what's going to happen. But that's just a minor complaint.

This brings me to the music. Because of a plagiarism scandal involving Kenji Yamamoto (the original composer for Kai), his music has been replaced on the Blu-Ray releases by that of the original DBZ composer, Shunsuke Kikuchi. Although I grew up with the English dub Bruce Faulconer music (and I still love many of his tracks and have fond memories of hearing them on the show), overall I prefer Kikuchi's music with the show. To me, it's a better fit, plus there are occasionally silent moments that add to the intensity. Unfortunately, there is a bit of a drawback. Much of the music placement is not the same as it was in the original DBZ, and some of the best tracks are not even used. This is something that I have adjusted to considering how much I love everything else about the show, but it is a major drawback to not hear some of Kikuchi's most iconic themes in certain scenes. However, it does contain some good tracks, and since this is, in a way, a ""new"" version of DBZ, I can live with it.

There aren't much bonus features on this set, but I wasn't really asking for them. I'm just happy to see DBZ Kai presented this way. Overall, DBZ Kai is a massive success in my opinion, and it's probably the perfect way for new fans to get into DBZ. Despite the music placement being different, Kai is currently my favorite version of the show. I can't wait to watch Seasons Two-Four (and I'm pumped that they're actually doing the Buu saga now).",1373068800,75,5787,4.486717267552182

This is due to the stricter than before Japanese broadcast laws. As someone who has finally completed the set, this is the ONLY scene censored like this in the new adaption. The rest is the same, or almost exactly the same as in Z. The voice acting is more solid than before, minus losing 2 great voice actors (bulma, gohan); the replacements do a pretty great job, but we all will certainly wish for the originals. There are a few so-so edits in the earlier eps, but from around 10 on, they finally get the hang of things.",1369612800,,655,4.333333333333333

4659376,2,B005DEUF0S,"I really underestimated what ""fillers"" really were.  DBZ does have plenty of episodes that we can do without but in this new Kai they skipped way too many.  They skipped the part where Vegeta says ""HE'S OVER 9000!""  That line is so legendary that games have implemented achievements about getting over 9000 points.  I know people who don't know what DBZ is that heard of that line.

The 1st episode Raditz just appears out of nowhere and there is just no build up of the character.  One episode Gohan doesn't know a single thing about fighting and is crying the whole episode.  Then the very next episode right at the start he is shooting energy out of his hands and jumping almost over cliffs.

They don't explain a single thing about the characters besides Goku who they say a few sentences about.  I watched every episode of the original DBZ and I know exactly what they took out.  I stopped watching when I knew season 1 was done and I already bought season 2 in the original version.  I really just wanted to have these seasons to watch when I felt like seeing some old time good action.  Having it in Blu-Ray actually made it even worse to watch.  For me the way the original DBZ  was made was perfect.  Having it in high definition made some parts stick out more then others and the action didn't flow.

Overall I do not suggest this if you're thinking that this new version will spice up the original DBZ.  This is just an extremely fast way to speed through all of DBZ.  Where one episode life is good, then the next the whole DBZ team is about to fight a Saiyan.",1368316800,7,1572,4.380622837370242
4659377,5,B005DEUF0S,THIS DVD IS 2 PARTS IN ONE BOX SET WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR. A+++ ALSO THE DUB IS GREAT AND UNCUT,1366502400,,98,3.3043478260869565
4659378,4,B005DEUF0S,"So I got this season a couple days ago and I love it so far. However the music to the theme song is terrible and the swearing is way unnecessary. I know a lot of DBZ fans like the swearing, but I don't. The reason I don't like it is that swearing just doesn't fit any of the characters; not even Vegeta (especially Goku). I grew up watching a clean DBZ and since it was such a big part of my childhood it has sentimental value to me; meaning I want it to be as close to what it was when I was a kid. I would really like it if someone could tell me if there is a version DBZ kai that doesn't swear. I really like DBZ kai. This is about my 3rd time watching the whole series through and the filler episodes just drag on and on and on. I already know the story and the characters, so the lack of story and personality in kai doesn't bother me much. That's why I really like it.

Also my favorite part in the whole series is when Goku turns into a Super Saiyan for the first time. In the original version the voice actor (Sean schemmel I believe) kinda missed the target on the yelling as Goku went to the SS form. In kai however, he has a great line (you ruthless, heartless, monster!) and a fantastic yell to go with it. But in the version I'm watching right now he says you ruthless, heartless, bastard...that ruins the whole mood for me.

Sorry for the semi long review, once again if someone could direct me toward a non-swearing kai version, that would be splendid. As for the product, I only gave it four stars because of the swearing and bad theme song (I can sing better than the singer). Other than that it is great! And for the seasoned veterans of DBZ, if you want to get rid of the fillers, get kai for sure!

P.S.-don't forget the non-swearing version so you can tell me :)

Update: 4/14/2013
So on the same day that I wrote this review, I may have figured out what I did wrong. When you type in Dragon Ball Z Kai in the search box on Amazon, it will come up with season one of DBZ Kai; under the title you will notice it lists the actors (on this product it was Christopher Sabat and Sean Schemmel. However it was $30, so I kind of got turned away by that. So I went to the DVD version and it was about $8 cheaper; so I went with the cheaper one. However, when you select the DVD version you will see under the title instead of listing Christopher Sabat and Sean Schemmel as the voice actors, it lists Colleen Clinkenbeard as an actor and Yasuhiro Nowatari as the director. You may be thinking that ""well she is the voice actor and he is the director"". However the DVD version has a horrible knock off version of the original DBZ Kai theme song and there is swearing involved with most characters (this was discussed in the review above). Here's my point: I happened to order the second season of DBZ Kai as well, but this one was in blu-ray (again because it was cheaper than the DVD, which makes no sense). This version however has the original theme song of DBZ Kai and so far there has been no swearing. I don't know why but i think that the DVD version is somehow a knock off.

If anyone has had the same problem please let me know what you think and what you have found out. I personally prefer the non-swearing version of the other version as said in the above review. Thanks in advance.",1365897600,,3305,4.165884194053208

However not everything blends completely well and it becomes noticeable at times, such as why Chichi is seen fainted is never explained (but if you've seen the original series you know), Gohan's training and why the T-rex is missing most of his tail when the previous episode it was all intact, and all of the back story of Planet Vegeta that was explained by King Kai.
The worst editing was Zarbon and Vegeta's battle being very heavily edited, but it ended still rather well.

There's a new music track which only exists entirely in Season 1 and tends to not fit very well in terms of what's going on in the animation.

English and Japanese voice overs were completely redone to fit the series better, and the English version still does it's job of over dubbing and adding lines just like it use too.

If you're looking for a no bull cut straight to the chase this is the version of the series you're looking for, no doubt.",1362528000,10,1130,4.449275362318841

4659386,4,B005DEUF0S,"Being born in 1991 and raised on a ranch with no featured/satellite television (only a few local and news channels), I was unable to look into the DB and DBZ series until I was 14. Even then our resources were limited! When it came to DB, I was only able to witness a few episodes. I had friends who gave me the idea of all I had missed. Then there was DBZ which I was able to endure the first 2 seasons of. Going on 2 years ago, I was gifted the opportunity to explore much of what I'd missed from the original DBZ when the newly featured DBZ Kai was released.

  In some sense I have no right to speak up for or against these series given my lack of knowledge. I was able to watch every episode of DBZ Kai and recover the storyline I was deprived of. After the series, I started putting the two against each other. As much as I enjoy keeping the classics alive in every sense, I must say that I'd enjoyed the DBZ Kai series over the originals.

  Yes, some detail was removed and a few entire episodes were also. But I'd seen enough of the original to state that although the new version is shorter, it also removed some unnecessary scenes/episodes. I remember the original episodes and I was sitting there watching the ""new"" episode presented by the channel with all my hopes up. In the end, I sat there watching a warrior powering up for the entire episode and took him another 5 episodes just to move a few feet! Just like the Broly movie where the last 30 minutes were spent watching 4 character laying on the ground while the other 2 go six rounds!

  In the new DBZ Kai series, that never happened. Maybe a few minutes were wasted with this issue. But, it didn't take 200 episodes to make out the storyline's two villains and there demise! So if you find yourself in my situation, I would recommend the DBZ Kai series over the original. I'm not saying in anyway that it is better (given it's just a retake of the original) than the original. I'm simply saying it's just as good regardless of the number of episodes. It tells the same story in a timelier manner. Nothing dramatically essential for total understanding is missing from DBZ Kai!!!",1358899200,3,2151,4.344139650872818

Well I am proud to say they finally cut out all the filler and made the show more true to the original manga and because of this the ""over 9000"" line has been corrected to the original ""over 8000"". I will say I have been watched it dubbed, a sin for anime fans =( but I multitask while I watch it and since I don't know Japanese I only have the one option. The new American voices in the show aren't the best in my opinion, but they're not horrible. It is unfortunate that the Kai ""Seasons"" are just repackaged versions of the different parts. So this literally contains Blu-rays of Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.

Many people don't like Kai. But a lot of people just have nostalgia with the original series. I do admit, the original was much better, but Kai is still very good. It took out a lot of unneeded sagas, and its more appropriate for a child to watch. I think something that defined my childhood was Dragon Ball, but most parents would not want their children watching the original series. Kai is also for anyone who wanted to watch the series again, but don't have enough time to re-watch the original series, like me. I think it's a great installment to the Dragon Ball series.

Product review:

The product quality is great! Although I think that they should have not cropped it like they did with the orange box sets, it could have easily been widescreen. The sound and video quality is nice.

Dragonball Z's best dub is the original English dub because of the music composer, Bruce Faulconer, but Faulconer didn't start scoring the series until mid Ginyu saga so you're not missing out on it here.
