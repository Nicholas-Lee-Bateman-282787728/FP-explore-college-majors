8108702,5,B000EE43QO,"We learn about the wisdom of Pythagoras, who believed that there is harmony in the spacing of the spheres. This DVD is extremely creative with interesting music and computer animation. I recommend it highly for students and for adults like me who want to learn new things.",1383177600,,272,4.808510638297872
8108703,4,B000EE43QO,"this video is well put together; i don't teach sciences, but research and share forgotten knowledge and wisdom of the ancients with anyone who is interested; the film is worth seeing, but you'll have to watch it more than once--due to the amount of info; any new-ager, a seeker, an open minded and curious individual will take pleasure in this new dvd; the only thing i didn't like was the narrator's voice and some background music.",1156809600,3,433,4.7105263157894735
8108704,5,B000EE43QO,"Star Cycles is the quintessential DVD for high school students that really does bring fun back to learning.  It is an engaging feast for the eyes, ears and brain.  There is clear relevance in studying the Ageless Wisdom from those seekers of Truth and Knowledge who have gone before us and even more so for those who have sought and found.  Pythagoras is just such a man who understood and taught all about the diversity and unity of life on Earth and the Cosmos.  His vivifying ideas are worthy of the attention the Pritchard School of Digital Arts brings forth in this dynamic and creative DVD for students.

As an educator, the ease of use and logistics of interfacing between the website and the video are a standout feature.  The film is broken down into 10 segments or subsections which could each be used as a stand-alone lesson or supplemental to a larger unit.  The combination of Movie and interfaced website makes for a powerful learning tool. There are also ""Teacher Guides"" that provide a solid overview of each part of the DVD with national curriculum guidelines and worksheets to print out for a class.

If you are like me and are always looking for a way to make Math, History, or any of the Sciences come alive in a new and exciting way for your students, you will love Star Cycles.  Technology and curricula which assists the classroom teacher to ignite the spark of enthusiasm for learning has never been more in demand.  Making the connection from isolated academic subjects such as Biology, History, Astronomy, and Math, to what is relevant to the lives of students and the world around them, is where real education begins. The interfaced website supports the classroom teacher after this connection and ignition has been made with a wealth of information that expands on the topic covered in each section of the film.  The student Study Guide section also includes essay questions that can be answered online and emailed to their teacher.  I was very impressed by the professional organization and presentation of this innovative, and educational DVD about ""timeless wisdom.""  I have found a kindred soul in Pythagorus as he states ""the most important act is the act of learning"".
