7919203,1,B00003O03R,I love Mario Van Peebles as an actor but this movie I believe was truly his worst. This was given away and they wanted to give it back to me. Told then do what they want but it will not stay in my collection of great movies.,1360800000,,224,3.7872340425531914
7919204,3,B00003O03R,"[[ASIN:B00003O03R Raw Nerve] I would like to thank amazon for the timely delivery of the two DVD set of ""Raw Nerve"" and ""Carlita's Secret"".  It was a great value for the price.  I only had one proble with the them.  Both DVD's are unrated, but in Raw Nerve the love scene between Mario Van Peebles and Nicollette Sheridan is cut to almost  nothing.  Other than that I enjoyed both of them.  Thank you once again.",1334534400,,412,4.426666666666667
7919205,5,B00003O03R,"Viewed this just yesterday and I have to have it for myself on DVD.  This is ""Internal Affairs"" & ""The Corruptor"" combined, but taken to another level--this movie (as unethical, debased, avaricious, secular, materialistic, brutal and downright sinister as it is) was entertaining, gripping, powerful, fast-paced, bold, funny and educational.  Educational from a criminal or subjective point of view.  The main character did lots of foolish and crazy things, but you may also come to realize he was pretty intelligent, nimble and brazen.  Not a movie to be viewed by kids, but great adult action and entertainment.  Mario van Peebles gave a superb performance...and he's not at all one of my favorite actors.  If not for the wayward, perverse and twisted nature of this movie, you would have heard more about this one.",1043539200,8,817,5.105263157894737
7919206,5,B00003O03R,"Up until the end of this turbo-feuled film I was wondering who was going to make it, who was going to get whom!?!  The story of a bad cop with little time left and what he finds he is capable of made me wonder to what lengths a human being will go to validate his life choices before dying.  Mario Van Peebles gives his best performance since New Jack City in this intense triangle tale of a man, his ex-partner and his beautiful girlfriend (a stunning and revealing Nicolette Sheridan)and survival of the fittest.  A must see (especially since Sheridan has a lot to show off... fast forward to the love scene!).",982540800,12,612,4.446428571428571
