8564678,5,B001NZ3DQE,"The End Game is a timely film and I found it a film full of critical ideas and issues facing the world, the sea and all living things. It is my opinion, Mr. Lee, with his work with sustainability, as outlined in his book, stands amongst the ranks of Thor Heyerdahl (In the Foodsteps of Adam) and James Lovelock (The Revenge of Gaia). Of course, Mr. Lee was an underwater cameraman with on the Calypso with Jacques-Yves Cousteau who consecrated his life to teaching the world ""about marvels that are at once exotic to us and yet ordinary in the abyss of the ocean""-Al Gore. Mr. Lee started a Nature Study Center at Las Gatas reef in Zihuatanejo, Mexico 40 years ago, and continued to teach the tenants of symbiosis and ways to serve Mother Nature.

The End Game documents the efforts of the Zihuatanejo community to successfully stop a huge cruise ship pier from being built in the bay.

Mr. Lee joins the ranks of dedicated and insightful activists trying to steer the course of people in nature to a sustainable future.",1230336000,,1020,4.5683060109289615
