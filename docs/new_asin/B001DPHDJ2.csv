However, I bought this for my German speaking niece only after carefully reviewing the description which specifically stated that German language was available on the discs.

3536184,3,B001DPHDJ2,"The quality of the box set is great! I love the BluRay clarity and that I can explore all the Limited Edition bonus features. The reason I gave 3 stars is because the additional footage isn't in the actual film. You have to go to the DVD Menu and watch the scenes by themselves. So it's not very useful to buy these DVDs when I could go watch those scenes on the internet. I was hoping the additional footage advertised meant that I was watching an extended version of the films with those scenes already in the movie. Also, this is the British edition because the first film is called ""Philosopher's Stone"" instead of ""Sorcerer's Stone."" Other than those miscommunications, the price was high. I found the same box set for $20 less on a different site about a month after I bought this. Probably my fault for not shopping smart, but $20 is pretty significant with delivery included. Overall, I'm happy because for about $10 per movie, I got a lot of bonus features and of course have the most important part, BluRay DVD Harry Potter films. What's not to like?!!",1405296000,,1062,4.536458333333333

3536187,5,B001DPHDJ2,"It is smaller than I imagined, but that makes it easier to store. Right away the little gold paper seal came off ribbon holding the movies together. That is my only complaint. The movies look as though they are a stack of books inside the trunk. Nicely done. I didn't open the collectors cards because they are in plastic and I want to preserve them. At the bottom is the box with the bookmarks. I am quite impressed with them. They are well made for bookmarks. I'm pleased. I think it is a great addition for any Harry Potter collection. I'll be ordering a second one for my daughter.",1404777600,,585,4.376146788990826

I bought the 3 Harry Potter's on Blu-Ray so I wanted them all on Blu-ray but no way would I pay THAT much for them as the ordinary discs were just fine. Then I saw this on sale at Christmas came to 3 bucks a disc, and free shipping so bought it, took the discs out of their little book packages and but them in a case that held 6.
The box does come with bonus' I hadn't noticed little book marks that are very nice and way better quality than I would have expected had I read the full description.
The trunk looks cute on the shelf and yes I would recommend this set.",1402358400,,636,3.937984496124031

well just my luck, The first dvd would not play in certain dvd players, The second video played fine just until abou half way through when it started to look like a old vhs tape skipping. It then  did skip to almost the end of the movie.  i bought the set for the girlfriend and if i am going to be stuck watching i would have at least liked the dvd to work properly

i am not going to even waist my time sending it back because hopefully i can help someone else out so they don t buy this product

There are flaws in this set and we have only gotten through the first three, frustrated we will find more problems. It is really disappointing to watch a movie that has been edited worse than when we see it on the television.  I did not realize these were edited or I would not have bought them.  The problems are as follows:

__The Sorcerer's Stone__: there was nothing of signifcance was a problem with this movie

__The Chamber of Secrets___: A key piece of the movie was missing, for example when Harry uses the flue powder to get to Diagon Alley but ends up in Borgins & Burkes in Knockturn Alley, he gets his hand caught in the grabbing hand, he then gets it released and leaves and see Hagrid.  It completely cut out Draco & Lucius Malfoy coming in and Harry needs to hide in the cabinet.  It did not show Lucius selling off many of his Dark Arts potions and Draco almost finding Harry.  We do not get to see the relationship between Draco and his father, where Lucius obviously keeps him on a short leash.  Also, some footage from the Flurish and Blotts Book Store is missing, likewise in the chamber itself.

__The Prisoner of Azkaban__:  The first 10 minutes of the movie is the middle of __The Polar Express___. It was not a trailer, but the actual movie.  The beginning of the Harry Potter movie (where you can pick scenes and bonus aspects) is missing. Also, when Herminione & Harry howl to call off the transformed Lupin, we do not see the result of the werewolf looking for the source of the sound.  The white stag patronus is missing, and not all of Hermione's Time travels"" are inserted.

3536344,4,B001DPHDJ2,"I just recieved my gift set yesterday and had a blast opening it and looking at all the little treasures but i do have some downsides all buyers should know about before they purchase it.
I couldn't wait to sit down with my tea and have a watch of the philosephers stone but i inserted it into my portable DVD player to see that i needed HD to play it.
Me, not being very tech-savvy went to my lounge room and tried it on the blue-ray playing device but it still did not work. i went to my computer as it has a blue-ray reader but it picked nothing what-so-ever up. i was starting tp get desperate and walked around the house desperatly tring to find something that would play it, but after a while i gave up nd went on the internet, to find that all HD divices would soon be discontinued. After all that i finally dicided to purchase a HD divice to pla it on. but i haven't recieved it in the post.

On the plus side you get 16 cute cards and 5 metal bookmarks. i have enjoyed watching all the behind the scenes DVD's (that are not HD) and the little trunk is devine, the DVD game is very entertaining. (but at somepoints relly tricky)
for a reasonable price, it would be totally worth it but remember if you don't have a HD device it probebly is half of what it is worth.",1357516800,,1273,4.133064516129032

My 21year old wants one, too.  The book marks are metal, not paper.  The trunk is heavy-duty cardboard.  Everything inside is fun!  Can't beat the price since it's only the first 5 movies.

The only dislike I had about the set was the ""book-like"" cases of the first to movies are CD size while the next 3 are blu-ray/dvd size. I wish they would have all been the same size but I don't always expect everything I wish for. You can see this in the picture.

The trading cards are pointless, but I like the envelope. I love the bookmarks! They pay for themselves. I don't like how the packaging was semi-torn, but it only cost me 30 dollars.

Its very affordable, and I love how the DVD boxes inside the ""trunk"" all resemble books from the movie, good quality.
Also the bookmarts are well made, I wasn't expecting much but I was really impressed, the cards I didn't really care for but maybe my son can get a kick out of them. :)

The con is I would want more extra special features bec the disc 2 of all the movies seem mostly like a kids game. Other than that, really fun and if your a HP fan you'll love this set<3",1354147200,,575,4.125

3536392,5,B001DPHDJ2,"I love this gift set. The box it comes in is super cute but its not very well made but its not crap either its really cute thought and is about a foot long and about half a foot tall (I'm just guessing on measurements). The box has a clamp so the box stays shut which is good.

Inside is a Harry Potter Bonus DVD which is in a cute case thus as big as a CD case. It includes- Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: A Glimpse into the World of Harry Potter,  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secerets... Revealed.  Harry Potter and The Prisioner of Azkaban: Something wicked this way comes; The Makings of Harry Potter and the Prisioner Of Azkabann; An interview in Spanish with Alfonso Cuaron,  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: Behind the Magic; Some Animal Magic; Dark Matters, New Masters, and  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: The Rebelion Begins; Fulfilling the Prophecy.

Harry Potter Year's One and Two are also inside a decorated CD case kinda thing. Which includes two disc's; Disc one the movie, Disc two Bonus Disc.

Harry Potter years Three, Four, and Five come in a decorative case as big as a small notebook (more like a regular DVD case. Also including the movie disc and Bonus Disc.

This set also includes a Harry Potter Interactive Game (DVD).  (play this in your TV)

An envelope labeled -
Mr. H. Potter
The Cupboard under the Stairs
4 Privet Drive
Little Whinging
Surrey
which opens and contains the Harry Potter Trading Cards.

Also the Gift Set includes a Bookmark Collection including a set of Five Harry Potter Bookmarks, one bookmark to represent each year-  An owl with a Hogwarts letter for Year One, a Gryffindor Chrest for Year Two, a Snitch for Year Three, a Firebolt for Year Four, and a Crystal ball (the Prophecy) on a stand for Year Five.

Everything in this set is super cool and totally worth the money i recommend this to any Harry Potter fan.",1345248000,,1892,4.481049562682216
3536393,1,B001DPHDJ2,"It just shows clips from the movies. If I wanted to rewatch the movies, I would rewatch the movies. This adds nothing to the franchise and is just a waste of time. The only thing it has going for it is that it's free, so the only loss is time.",1343692800,,243,3.88
3536394,1,B001DPHDJ2,"The ""trunk"" is cheap cardboard and the movies don't play in most dvd players.
I hate that WB puts out junk like this.",1343347200,,117,4.130434782608695
3536395,4,B001DPHDJ2,"First things first, the price.  This is a great price for a 5-disc set with bonus discs and extras.  The movies are what the movies are.  The extras packaged with the set are a mixed bag.  The trading cards seemed silly, but my 10 year old bookworm loves the set of metal bookmarks in various shapes and themes.  The video transfer quality of the first 3 discs isn't quite as good as on discs 4 and 5, but I bought these primarily for my kids and they're not that picky.  If you're a videophile you'll be happier with a high quality Blu-Ray set of discs.  As others have remarked, the packaging is weird.  Some of the movies are in small jewel cases like audio cd's while others are in full size clamshell cases.  The cover art on the cases doesn't match any of the other DVD versions of the movies that I've seen.  It really does feel like this set was put together from remaindered discs repackaged, but that doesn't really affect the quality of the discs themselves.",1342224000,,969,4.393258426966292
3536396,3,B001DPHDJ2,This was  a quick review of the Harry Potter movies and I am glad it was free as I did not find it very interesting.  Stick to the full movies as they are a lot more interesting.  You get what you pay for.,1341705600,,205,3.7209302325581395
3536397,5,B001DPHDJ2,"This set completed the collection. The bonus dvd all 5 yrs is entertaining. Gives a little more info on how the movies were made, plus had a few deleted scenes. The movies are not what youd get if you bought them seperately. While they come with an extra dvd with bonus material, the movie dvd is just colored with the title printed on it and each is in its own case of the same color. The book marks are a nice touch as was the velcro strap and ""paper"" clasp with the intials ""HP"". It came off when I tried to undo the strap. Over all I highly recommend this set for those who want the first 5 yrs and don't have them. its worth the money.",1341273600,,640,4.047244094488189
3536398,1,B001DPHDJ2,"Why would I look to ""thousands of free movies"" for an ad?

3536399,5,B001DPHDJ2,"I love the Harry Potter series and actually didn't purchase any of the movies previously. With this set, which I only paid 22 dollars for, you get so much. The book like cases that each of the movies come in is neat, and I liked how they stacked them and wrapped them together. The bookmarks are really cool too, even if you just want to look at them instead of using them. The luggage case itself is nice as well.

As a fan, it's just a nice starter set to have and you can't really beat the price. I'm pretty sure you can't even buy each of the individual movies 1 - 5 for the same price.",1339545600,,590,4.042735042735043
3536400,4,B001DPHDJ2,This box set is a very cool buy for any Harry Potter fan it comes with more than just the DVDs but I must warn you of a few things. The first movie has the wrong title!!!!!! they called it Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone instead of the Sorcerers Stone????!!! Then I was expecting it to be the uncut version since it has a different name but unfortunately it is not and the bonus disc is more like a game than a DVD......everything else is pretty cool besides the fact that it is only years one through five. ALSO my suitcase has three tears on it along the edges! Kind of bummed me out... Just wait for the box set that has all the DVDS to go down in price I bet it will be worth it.,1338854400,,691,4.0144927536231885
3536401,4,B001DPHDJ2,"I was surprised to find some sort of Harry Potter paraphernalia for free on Amazon instant. I already own all the movies but I don't have time to watch them all whenever I'm in the mood for it. I at first watched it on my older television in my living room, some formats are fuzzy on it others aren't. It was rather fuzzy, then I watched on my smaller newer television and it was much better quality. It brought back memories of reading the books, going to the theaters and everything I associated with the harry potter films. I'm probably going to be setting time aside to watch the films next week.",1338595200,,600,4.366071428571429

3536403,5,B001DPHDJ2,"I am an avid Harry Potter fan so when I saw this on Amazon for such a good price I had to have it. Even though it's only years 1-5 it is so nostalgic and fun to have. The movies are in adorable book like cases and there is a Hogwarts letter, bookmarks and trading cards. The trunk alone is probably my favorite part of the whole package. There's also a dvd game and a lot of special features. This was such a cool addition to my HP collection and would make a great gift for any HP fan.",1337126400,,486,3.919191919191919
3536404,5,B001DPHDJ2,"You can get all five disks for less than $25 from WalMart, but this is a must-have for any Harry Potter fanatic. The cases that the DVDs come in are unique and beautiful. All the special features are exciting to watch. The DVD game is entertaining, but after playing the GameCube/Wii video games, it's clunky and awkward to play - it's still nice to have, though. The trunk comes with several extra goodies such as stickers and beautifully-made bookmarks. The trunk itself is smaller than I initially expected, but it comes with everything and the quality is good, so I am not disappointed. I've owned this for months now and the trunk hasn't fallen apart, which is an impressive feat since there are several kids in the house. Couldn't be happier overall.",1335657600,,756,4.734848484848484

3536406,5,B001DPHDJ2,"I missed these the first time around when it came out because it was like $125. I would love to get the new complete set with 6-7, but it's between $400-500. I don't have that kind of money for movies because my bf would have killed me. This was a nice compliment. They are movies 1-5 and are in wonderful condition. The whole case looks like luggage and very cute. The best part was the bookmarks. Even my grumpy bf admitted to liking it. Recommend!!",1335139200,,451,4.317647058823529
3536407,4,B001DPHDJ2,The box was a little torn when I got it but besides that all the discs were there and working.  The bookmark set alone is worth the money you pay for the set but the other little extras are nice too.  Nice for displaying purposes.,1334707200,,230,4.088888888888889
3536408,4,B001DPHDJ2,Best bang for the buck if you want the movies but not the supplemental discs. All you get are the extras they put on the five Blu-ray movie discs. None of the supplemental discs that shipped in the two disc packages are included.,1334534400,,229,4.348837209302325

3536411,4,B001DPHDJ2,"I was concerned with reviews that said the 5th disc was just special features and not the 5th movie.  Likewise, people said their discs were loose.

I didn't have any of the problems.  My discs were perfect and all the discs were the movies. I forgot how different the first movies are from the later ones.  The special effects are so bad!!!  But great nostalgia.

You will laugh when you see Daniel Radcliffe try to act as a little kid.",1333929600,,437,4.4
3536412,2,B001DPHDJ2,"This is an update to my original review. After purchasing a new DVD player, found that the HD DVD version of this set STILL will not play. Had to return the set and was then only given partial credit as per the return policy even though everything was returned in excellent condition.

3536413,5,B001DPHDJ2,"I always buy my school books from Amazon because they always arrive in pristine condition for a low cost.  When searching for a Christmas present for my boyfriend, I decided to look on Amazon.  Being a huge Harry Potter fan, I knew I wanted to buy all the movies out at the time for my boyfriend.  I noticed that one order had movies 1-5 in a set for a reasonable price.  Each movie came in their own movie case just like any other movie, but they were smaller and thinner.  However, each movie fits together into a box for easy storage.  Every movie worked without a problem and came plastic wrapped.  I received the movies shortly after ordering and was able to track my package along the way.

Harry Potter movies are extremely entertaining and can capture the attention of any audience.  For those of you with kids, the movies do get scarier as time goes on.  The best way to allow your children to watch/read Harry Potter is to have Harry and your kids the same age.  I grew up with Harry and was not frightened but related to some of the problems he was going through.  He is eleven in the first movie, and then he increases in age every year.  That way younger children are not becoming frightened by the movies.  I HIGHLY recommend Harry Potter to any person!  It is a fun, adventurous, and loving series that once you start, you will not be able to stop!  I will forever be a Harry Potter fan!",1332892800,,1402,4.355212355212355
3536414,5,B001DPHDJ2,"Well, what can one say?  It *IS* Harry Potter, after all.  Having spent a number of years in an English boarding school (no, NOT Hogwarts, regrettably), I can relate to the life.  It's interesting to watch these as the actors grow up. I recommend this as good starter introduction to Harry and his friends, although I'm certain the entire series is now available in one box. :) Get some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy!",1331856000,,416,4.594594594594595
3536415,1,B001DPHDJ2,"I was very excited when I received this as I had gotten a great deal on this set. However, the 2nd disc (Chamber of Secrets) did not work. It seems that only the music and background noise made it on the disc but not the actual voices. I am very disappointed as it must now be returned and the price is substantially more than I initially paid for it, not that I would purchase it again anyways due to the poor quality. Also, I appear to have received the Canadian version, so Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone is now Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Very weird. Either way, I will probably resort to purchasing the individual movies and not the boxed set.",1331510400,,667,4.387096774193548
3536416,5,B001DPHDJ2,"Purchased this gift for a die hard HP fan! I read the reviews about missing disc so I was a bit leary but they certainly had it fixed when I receive this in the mail.  Good packing and a nice presentation in the box!  The actual case itself doesn't stay closed very well but they kids actually like the lid open so for us, it's fine!  Wish i could find this for the complete set!",1331424000,,379,4.026666666666666
3536417,4,B001DPHDJ2,"I can only assume the problems being addressed in the numerous 1 star reviews have since been resolved, as I got all 5 bluray discs in good condition(although some were loose in the individual case, but that probably happened during shipping).  All the bookmarks, cards, etc were as promised.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is Sorceror's Stone(Philosophers stone on the dvd, don't know what that's about but it didn't bother me) freezes about 5 minutes before the end.  If it had happened earlier I would've sent for a refund, but since it happens so late I'll let it slide.  Also, the clasp thing that keeps it shut is a little loose, but again, a minor flaw in an otherwise nice looking case.  The first two movies aren't that much different in quality comparing between the bluray version and a regular dvd version(which I find pretty common with ""older"" movies), but from 3-5 you can really tell a difference and I think the set is worth the price.  It would be nice if they offered a set like this for 1-8, but as I already own 7 and 8 on bluray I didn't feel like waiting.",1330732800,,1095,4.422885572139304
3536418,5,B001DPHDJ2,"I was a little worried about buying this box set after reading some of the reviews about problems people had, but I figured I'd give it a try. My daughter wanted Harry Potter stuff for Christmas and I thought this set would be such an awesome surprise, especially with the bookmarks and other extras that come with it. I'm so glad I took a chance, because she was SO happy! She even took the bookmarks to school to show everyone. We watched all the movies and they all worked just fine. Phew! I haven't played any of the bonus material disks yet, but if there are any problems I'll update my review. So far my only complaint is that the latch on the box is cheap and doesn't hold the box closed but my husband said he could fix it, so no big deal there. For such a great price on all the movies and all the extras, I could not be happier.",1330560000,,838,4.147239263803681
3536419,5,B001DPHDJ2,"So if you have been reading previous reviews, it seems all the major issues have been resolved. All the cases are the same size (bluray slim), the films are 1080p quality and disc five is indeed the movie and not a special features disc. However, the title of the first movie is ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" (Not Sorcerer's Stone). After a brief moment of confusion, my wife and I did some research and found out that this is in fact the name of the film and original book as it was released in the UK. So this might even be cool for you if you're into having rarities. Since we already had movies 6, 7.1 and 7.2 this is a great set at a great price!

Another note: I bought this set from Amazon so I could get it shipped PRIME and not a third party, so I can only speak for the product as sold by Amazon and not any of the third parties.",1330560000,,852,4.1017964071856285

I was kind of disappointed with Warner Bros. bare bones HP sets that include all 8 films.  I know next holiday season (2012) they will have an amazing collector's set for the Potter series but I decided to go for this set and buy Deathly Hallows 1&2 to complete the collection now.

The review is not about the films, it is about the product, mainly the extra content (physical not video).  I made another video of me opening the product and more interactive, but that one didn't work out.  Instead, here is a video of the all the extra content and me talking about it.

Main Reasons for Purchase (at least for me):
  Price; $17 when I bought it
  Wicked Case
  Hogwarts Acceptance Letter  (later found it, it's just the envelope, still very cool!)
  Huge HP Fan

Everything that comes with the collection:
  Collectible Case (in the form of Harry's trunk)
  PHILOSOPHER""S STONE  dvd (2 discs)(and yes, it's not SORCERER'S STONE)
  CHAMBER OF SECRETS  dvd (2 discs)
  PRISONER OF AZKABAN  dvd (2 discs)
  GOBLET OF FIRE  dvd (2 discs)
  ORDER OF THE PHOENIX dvd (2 discs)
  HP Bonus DVD (includes documentaries and featurettes)
  Interactive DVD Game (Hogwarts Challenge)
  Hogwarts Acceptance Letter Envelope, which contain...
  16 Collectible Trading Cards
  5 Metal Bookmarks (Golden Snitch, Hedwig w/ Letter, the Broom, Gryffindor Crest, and Prophecy Ball)

Hope you guys find this helpful.  Also, I have not played back any of my DVDs or extra content, I'll keep you guys posted if any issues arise.  Thanks.",1323388800,,1684,6.170305676855895

3536434,5,B001DPHDJ2,"I will admit that I repeatedly made fun of the existence of boxed sets being available before the entire series was over, but when it was all said and done, this ended up being perfect for me.

I had already purchased these movies individually, but I didn't have a blu-ray player at the time, so I had the first five on plain dvd. I bought the remaining movies on blu-ray and wanted the whole collection on blu-ray.

Not only do I now have all of the movies on blu-ray - I have this super cute little trunk and some awesome little bookmarks. Seriously - I love these bookmarks...

Seeing as how this is either the same price or sometimes less than buying just the first 5 movies, it's definitely worth the purchase. And once I take our the bookmarks and the game dvd, and other stuff in it, I am pretty positive I will be able to fit all of the movies in the trunk for a cute way to keep them all in one place.",1321833600,,910,4.159090909090909

Why I neglected to send it back I have no idea.  I just pulled it out and tried it again. No luck.

The best extras are the bookmarks in the shapes of famous HP items--like the Nimbus 2000, the golden snitch, etc.  One thing to be aware of, this must have been originally packaged for europe, as the first movie is entitled ""The Philosopher's Stone"" and not ""The Sorcerer's Stone.""  The philosopher stone is the original title of the first book and first movie, which was changed to sorcerer's stone in the US because we Americans don't understand such big words, i guess.",1312588800,,575,4.673267326732673
3536443,3,B001DPHDJ2,"So, my family and I have had this product for a while, randomly rewatching movies out of order. Nothing really seemed out of place until yesterday. I had just  finished rereading the Goblet of Fire and had the urge to watch the movie. I guess that within the 2-3 years of owning the box set, we hadn't watched Goblet of Fire (which, in itself, is odd) because I was shocked when our Blu-ray player wouldn't play the movie. I double check the disk, and it was an HD disk, NOT Blu-ray. Thinking that we had unknowingly had only HD disks the whole time (which I was skeptical of because I had never had any problems watching the other movies) we hadchecked all the other disks. The rest were Blu-ray. So now I'm annoyed and can't watch my Goblet of Fire... :(

Other then that, however, this is the most abdorable box set I have ever seen. If that GoF disk had been Blu-ray as well, I would have given this 5 stars.",1312243200,,912,4.296511627906977

The next night, we popped in ""Chamber of Secrets"". Locks up just starting to play. We messed with it for a while, checked on possible software updates to the player, etc. Finally watched the DVD version which I also had. To make a long story short, four of the five disks will not play. The newest player (LG 3D model) does nothing at all. An older Magnavox BD player just tells me that playback may not be enabled for this disk (!?!?!). So I'm waaaay out of the return window on this set.",1310774400,,742,4.384057971014493

Isn't it curious that they are the first images you see when doing a quick check of what movies are available on Amazon Instant Video and these non-movies just happen to have the same picture (cover) as the full length movie?  I think it's obvious they get folks to sign up for Amazon Instant Video thinking that there are some new releases (Harry Potter, Avatar, King's Speech, etc), only to find these are mere previews or advertisements or how they filmed some scene.

I reread each previous Harry Potter before moving on to the newest, and watched each movie before heading to the theater. This series of previews is an advertisement telling you to do that. It is the theatrical trailers for each of the first 6 movies strung together, with a couple shots thrown in recommending you watch the first 5 movies on BluRay or DVD before watching the 6th movie. I suppose it accomplishes exactly what it set out to do, I just didn't realize that I was getting trailers. In short, it's not that there was anything wrong, per se, with this download, but there was also pretty much no point. Unless you really really like previews. Then, have at it!

3536453,5,B001DPHDJ2,"First off, I am not reviewing the movies themselves in this review. What I am reviewing is the set itself. First off, by far my favorite thing about this set is how thin each individual case it. It is so thin that 2 of them stacked on top of each other is enough to have the same width of 1 normal DVD case. I wish all cases were like this and not just the set cases. If all movie cases were this thin it would save a lot of shelf space.

Secondly, as far as picture quality the images look amazing on screen. You can see everything as long as you have a 1080p tv (some may have only a 720p ... I'm not sure what it looks like on that, but from what I hear it still looks terrific). You can see the individual pores in their faces and everything. It really is amazing to see how far technology has come with bringing us the best picture quality they can.

Overall, it is a terrific set and I highly recommend it. HOWEVER, people have brought up a very valid point. Obviously, as everyone knows, there are 8 movies total with Harry Potter so this means they will come up with a COMPLETE box set one day once all movies are released. I would have waited, but I was far too impatient to wait and to me it is not that big of a deal to have a box set for the first 5 and then buy the next 3 movies individually. Others out there will prefer to wait though because it will look a lot nicer on their shelf to have the complete set sitting there all in it's own box. I agree, it is nice, but like I said I have no patience for it. So it's all a matter of preference really.",1300320000,,1565,3.965079365079365

It was a bit of a surprise that the copy of the first movie is titled 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone', but my daughter being the HP lover that she is thought that was very cool.  The real hit was, of course, the extras.  The trading cards are packaged in the envelope that Harry received his letter in which is just adorable.  But it's the bookmarks that made this set.  They are beautifully designed and made [of metal].  Her favorite is the owl but it tears up pages when used.  We've decided to display that one and use the broom.  She hasn't gotten into the extra DVDs yet, but she loves the idea of them.  The outer packaging is wonderful, but being cardboard won't stand up to a lot of abuse and doesn't always close properly.

3536467,4,B001DPHDJ2,"First off, let me say the actual HD DVDs are excellent, considering they're the theatrical cuts of the movies. They look great, have some nice extras, and remind me why I wish HD DVD had survived instead of Blu-ray Disc.

However, HD DVD is dead, and that's why I picked these up. In a word: Inexpensive. You won't get five Harry Potter movies in Blu-ray Disc format for the current going price of this gift set. This was an excellent buy. I still have my HD DVD player, and this is a good way to use it. HD is HD, and in 1080p, the Harry Potter movies look brilliant.

Now, as to the rest of the package, I'm impressed. It's got a lot of neat little toys and things. The whole thing is meant to look like Harry's chest, and the HD DVDs are packaged in little cases that look like Harry's school books.

While I appreciate what they were trying to do there, I have to say: I really wish they'd given me standard HD DVD cases instead. The little flip-open jewel cases are in two different sizes, and are definitely not shelf-friendly. I guess the designers of this gift set couldn't fathom anyone wanting to keep their discs anywhere but in the included chest-shaped box. It's really kind of a bummer, because now I'll have to dig up some HD DVD cases and print some cover art so I can store these with the rest of the collection which has to be on Blu-ray Disc (since they're not making HD DVD versions to finish out the collection).

The bookmarks are rather nice. Too nice, in fact. I hate to take them out of the case!

The Interactive DVD game is a nice bonus. While it's standard fare for this type of thing (kind of a ""choose your own adventure"" book in DVD format), it's fun and was essentially a freebie in this gift set.

The bonus features for all movies are on one disc. This is both good and bad. Good, because you're not swapping, but bad because when I do put these in their own HD DVD cases, I'll have to have one case for the special features for all the movies, which is kind of odd. Most movies come with their own special features disc.

The other negative to this Limited Edition Gift Set is the fact that Warner Bros didn't give us extended editions of the movies, like the ones they televise on Disney Channel and ABC Family. Instead, these are all straightforward theatrical cuts, flaws and all.

While I enjoy the theatrical cuts, there's just so much missing once you've seen the extended editions, and I don't understand why WB didn't sell them in ""limited edition"" sets like this. This would be the ideal set in which to include those editions, don't you think? I guess we'll have to wait until the whole eight-movie set is available before they offer the extended editions in a set like this.

These are minor quibbles though. Really, this is a brilliant set of HD DVDs, a bonus interactive game DVD, some nice toys and collectibles, and a cool box. The price is right, and I highly recommend it to any Harry Potter fan who still has an HD DVD player.

AND A NOTE TO WOULD-BE BUYERS:

The HD DVD version you see here DOES require a special player. You can't play these in your DVD player, even if you think it's a DVD player that plays HD (it doesn't). You can't play these in your Blu-ray Disc player, either. You need an ""HD DVD"" player, which is a discontinued format.

You can get HD DVD players here, or elsewhere. The XBox 360 can play HD DVDs if you purchase an add-on drive (you CANNOT play HD DVDs on the XBox 360's built-in DVD drive). Just please, please, please understand that HD DVD is not meant for DVD players. It's a separate technology, and frankly, I'm sick of seeing poor reviews of this EXCELLENT product because some people are too technologically-impaired to understand the difference between DVD and HD DVD, or HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc.

Once again:  YOUR DVD PLAYER CAN NOT PLAY ""HD DVD"" DISCS!

Now that we've sorted all that out, I'll summarize the review by saying this: If you want Harry Potter films 1-5 in HD, this is the best, least expensive way to get them if you don't mind a lack of HD DVD cases.",1283817600,,4059,4.378989361702128

I know, there's people who doesn't like the disc cases because you can't fit them inside those racks they sale and you are stuck to keep'em inside the trunk because the different sizes. I really like this because it feels like a very special way of keeping the movies together and collected. OK now the bad part, I'll talk about the video quality. I bought this over the DVD format because I thought that Blu-ray meant automatically superior sound and video quality but it wasn't the case. I couldn't really notice the difference between DVD and Blu-ray at least in none of the first 4 movies. The Order Of The Phoenix was the ONLY ONE (shakes head) that had a higher quality. I'll recomend that you'll be OK as long as you are a Harry Potter fan or a movie box set collector; go and buy it. But if you are looking for quality, convenience and price, get them individually on DVD and buy your favorite one on blu-ray or just get the DVD format package. I was really dissapointed when I play the first one and I couldn't see the reason for buying a DVD over a Blu-ray, it seemed about the very same.

Overall, the three main characters - Harry, Ron, and Hermione - are well cast and convey both the joy and seriousness of the wizarding world.

It seems the directors and scriptwriters weren't quite sure how to transform the books into movies. For example, it never really becomes clear how and why Voldemort has gained so many followers. Is it a certain ideology? Is it because his followers want to kill muggles? It just seems that he's a two-dimensional ""bad guy"" with nothing better to do than be evil. That's something I think could have been explored more than, say, Harry's flirtations with Cho (he ends up marrying Ginny anyway).

I believe the director changed after the second film, who happened to have a different vision for the films. The presentation here for a box set is average. You get an individual ""slim"" case for each movie in a cardboard box. No bells and whistles really, but there's bound to be another box set out at least after the final film is released. As far as video quality, I'd say the first few films are decent, but in the fourth and fifth you can really tell you're watching in Hi-Def. I can't comment much on the sound as I only have a 2.1 system.

All in all, it was a great buy at $56 (Gold box) over the summer, which comes out to just over $11 per blu-ray. On top of that, I was able to buy this set right before The Half-Blood Prince was out in theaters.",1259107200,,843,4.047904191616767

The next screen says you are officially accepted to Hogwarts only to hear an announcer say to ""please insert disc 2."" Well there is no disc two.  If they are going to offer this box set not as special editions, then they need to make sure the DVD menus and things are updated appropriately to be the standard edition only.

Regular DVD's (the first 3 at least that I can recall) on my PS3 which up-scales them looked almost, if not as good (pretty much, unless I'm old and going blind ... at 27).

SPECIAL FEATURES/ETC:

Right now there's nothing that stands out on these disks as a great feature to mention.

CONCLUSION:

If you already own some of the disks and want to buy the blu-ray to replace those, it may not be the best use of your money over buying simply the ones you're missing. However knowing that there are movies left to come, it may be best to wait for either the next box set, or further through the series. (not to say that if you get it for a good price, not to buy it ;))",1253491200,,929,4.196629213483146
3536549,4,B001DPHDJ2,"If the review was based solely on the Harry Potter movies, I would give it a 5 star, no questions asked.  The reason I gave it a 4 star is for the Blu Ray quality.  Years one and two do not look crisp at all.  Actually, it feels like a direct transfer of the original DVD.  Maybe because they are older films, or maybe because they were not digitally filmed, but for one reason or another, they look grainy.  Years three thru five look incredible.  Seeing wand fights and womping willows in 1080P is a pleasure.  I still think this is an amazing deal for the money, and if you don't have all of em its a steal.  Be aware there is an ULTIMATE edition of all five movies coming out.  You can view them on Amazon.  I'm not sure if they will remaster the transfers for the original two, but it might be worth waiting to see if the visual quality improves at all.",1253491200,,858,4.1454545454545455

It is true that it clearly states on the ad THAT the product is HD-DVD, but not WHAT an HD-DVD is. I had NO IDEA. I later found out that the HD-DVD format was a DVD format that had been supported by Microsoft, the patron saint of lost causes and that the world stopped supporting it about three years ago.

When I contacted the supplier, they told me that they would reimburse me, but that I would have to pay postage from Japan and that there would be a restocking fee. It would cost me MORE to get my money back than to just forget about it.

The supplier is responsible and Amazon is also responsible for this. The ad on Amazon was misleading. There was important data missing from the ad and in that sense it was misleading.

My advice to Amazon buyers is to read the description very carefully, or you may get ripped off too.

I received my DVDs today, checked them all and they're all in working condition which makes this a great value for under $30!!
I'm not a huge Harry Potter fanatic, I haven't read the books but I love these movies so this was a great buy for me.

Having read the reviews I think a lot of people complained about other silly things. You have to realize 'you get what you pay for.' That means straight up, basic packaging. No muss, no fuss.

If you're looking for fancy packaging with bonus features and what-not then you should look into getting the gift set!
People complained about flimsy packaging or complained they were disappointed when they did not receive additional bonus features.
This is NOT supposed to include special features, this was only a (disappointing, inexcusable) mistake on some people's orders.

***These DVDs are nothing fancy. Just the movies in individual cases, and that's it.***

If you are looking for additional features or games then you will need to buy those features separately! If you are looking for expensive or cool packaging then buy the gift set!!

As for me, all I wanted was the movies and this set is just what I was looking for at a reasonable price. I actually prefer the compact packaging of this set. The cases are thinner and take up less room than regular DVD cases.

One more thing, someone else had mentioned this before, and I just wanted to confirm, there are A LOT of previews on the 5th DVD so you'll have to skip ahead to get to the movie.",1249948800,,1661,4.575757575757576

MY MISTAKE! When I unwrapped the package and opened the ""Order of the Phoenix"" case, there was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING there. Not even the special features disc. I of course called Amazon, and they are expecting me to mail the entire set back instead of them just sending me the last movie. Even though they are sending me a free mailing label, I'm still going to have to trot down to the post office and wait in line which is an inconvenience. Amazon should just be sending me a separate movie. Of course I'm going to wait until I get the new set before I go anywhere to ensure that it is complete.

3536617,5,B001DPHDJ2,"Some people have problems with movies because they aren't exact recreations of the source novels. However, the filmmaker is working in a different medium and has to use his or her visual acuity, not just words, to best tell the story.  This set of 5 Harry Potter movies achieves this goal. Sometimes I'll find myself saying, ""Oh, I wish this chapter from the book was in the movie,"" but realistically, each movie would have to be the size of a tv series to do this.  The novels are huge and a two+ hour movie can't possibly cover everything in the novels. Maybe some day a series could be made of the books but then one wonders if any actor could ever be the perfect Harry Potter as Daniel Radcliffe is. Radcliffe was not even an actor when he was spotted as a child as the perfect Harry Potter. It is almost as if he were destined to play Potter.  I don't have children or grandchildren so experiencing Harry Potter was something I did for myself as an adult.  If you do have children or grandchildren, this set would be perfect to keep around for their entertainment as well, especially for visiting at holiday time.  It is also the perfect gift set for children and even some adults (I certainly wouldn't have minded receiving this as a gift).

All the things included were in perfect condition as was the box. It looks absolutely wonderful!!! I recommend this to anyone who loves the Harry Potter series and who doesnt own the dvds yet.

I just started reading the harry potter books and I will definitely be using the bookmarks included!!!

3536619,5,B001DPHDJ2,"Like many others, I too had been renting these movies so often that I figured I might as well splurge on a boxed set. Well, the prices were quite steep until this particular edition came out - all five Harry Potter movies for a value deal! It's just a simple, no-frills boxed collection of all five movies, i.e. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Each comes in a plastic case that is pretty flimsy, but for the price you get all five movies that one can conveniently play over and over, instead of renting the individual movies. I am saving up to purchase the entire HP collection [1-8] once Deathly Hallows Parts 1 & 2 are screened and eventually make it on to DVD which will probably be sometime in 2012[?]. As a HP fan, I don't mind splurging on a boxed set of the entire movie collection, and don't mind the wait either.

The first 3 movies in this set are rated PG, and the remaining 2 are rated PG-13. The language and subtitles option for ""HP and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is English and Spanish, the languages option for ""HP and the Chamber of Secrets"" are English and Spanish [subtitles are in English, French, and Spanish], the languages option for ""HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" are English and French [subtitles are Eng, French, and Spanish], the languages option for ""HP and the Goblet of Fire"" are Eng and Spanish [subtitles are in Eng, French, and Spanish], and finally, the languages option for ""HP and the Order of the Phoenix"" are English, French, and Spanish [subtitles are in Eng, French, and Spanish]. Here's a brief recap of the 5 movies contained in this boxed set for those new to the HP world:

""HP & the Sorcerer's Stone"": 11-year-old orphan Harry Potter[Daniel Radcliffe], finds that he is actually a young wizard and goes off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, run by Headmaster Albus Dumbledore [Richard Harris]. Harry is sorted into the House of Griffindor, where he makes friends with Ron Weasley [Ruper Grint], and brilliant Hermione Granger [Emma Watson], and discovers the joy of Quidditch [a wizard sport]. The trio find themselves embroiled in an adventure, having to do with the elusive and mysterious Philosopher's stone, owned by Nicholas Flamel. Harry also has to deal with the sad truth of his parents' death at the hands of the Dark Wizard Voldemort, who seems to have disappeared, after failing to kill Harry on the night his parents' were murdered. Harry bears the scar of the encounter on his forehead, and in this first instalment, begins his epic battle against evil.

""HP & the Chamber of Secrets"" - Harry and his best friends Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts for another amazing year. Harry has been warned by Dobby the house elf to stay away from Hogwarts but ignores the warning, and finds himself close to peril many times throughout the year. The trio discover a strange message that the chamber of secrets has been opened, and when Muggle-borns [i.e. students born to non-magic humans] are found petrified, Harry and his friends race against time to solve the mystery.

""HP & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" - Harry discovers that Sirius Black, a notorious mass murderer has escaped from the wizard prison of Azkaban, and is out looking for Harry. Though Harry feels safe at Hogwarts, he is perturbed by his encounters with the Dementors, the guards of Azkaban, who seem to have a terrible effect on Harry. Under his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, Harry learns some new skills that may help him battle his adversaries, and in the course of the year, also discovers the truth about his parents' death, as well as the real identity of Sirius Black.

""HP & the Goblet of Fire"" - Harry and his friends attend the Quidditch World Cup where disaster strikes and the Black Mark [of Voldemort] is seen in the sky signalling his forces are gathering strength. Harry and friends return to Hogwarts which is hosting the Triwizard Tournament, and though only students aged 17 and older are allowed to compete, Harry finds his name chosen, and thus together with the other chosen champions, i.e. Cedric Diggory [Robert Pattinson who went on to garner fame as Edward Cullen in Twilight], Fleur Delacouer and Viktor Krum, faces one peril after another in a bid for the championship. But as always, darkness follows Harry and he finds his greatest challenge yet in this 4th installment.

""HP & the Order of the Phoenix"" - Harry and the rest of the Hogwarts students are in for a nasty suprise when a ministry official, Umbridge [Imelda Staunton in a wicked role] is sent to Hogwarts to keep an eye on Dumbledore and the rest of the faculty and students. Harry gets on Umbridge's bad side through no fault of his own, and the gang decide to rebel by forming their own group which teaches students to battle the dark arts. This installment is the darkest of the five here, and viewers will see how Harry and company have truly matured, the actors coming into their own in each of the roles.

I hope this whets HP newbies' appetite for watching the movies. Though the movies do not capture all of what is contained in the books [that would take hours of screen time] - the sense of magic and wonder is quite amazing as portrayed on screen. Highly recommended [both the boxed set and the movies].",1249430400,,5432,4.687631027253669
3536620,5,B001DPHDJ2,"I loved the movies!!! Exactly what I wanted! The Harry Potter Series is Magical, no pun intended!!!

3536621,4,B001DPHDJ2,"Briefly
=====
When I ordered the Years 1-5 Blu bundle I already had years 1-4 on DVD and year 5 on Blu. My expectations were to get significantly better picture quality and improved sound. These being at least for years 1-4 original DVD re-releases, I did not expect a lot of Blu 'special treatment'. My expectations, both the positive and the negative ones were generally met with a few disappointments on the special features treatment.

Physical delivery
============
We get a small bundle. Each individual movie is delivered on one Blu disc inside a Blu slim case. There's nothing inside the case but the disc itself. The carton box lists the special features for each of the 5 movies on the back.

Video
====
Movies are all presented on 1080p and a 2.4:1 aspect ratio. The picture quality is excellent even by Blu standards.

Sound
=====
Linear PCM 5.1 sounds amazing. It's a clear improvement over the DVD's Dolby 5.1 which is also available as the default audio option.

Special features
============
This is where, surprisingly, the Blu edition offers 'less' than the DVD.

- All the DVD ROM features present on the DVD releases are missing. This is understandable and not unexpected. There are very few computers with Blu drives these days.
- All the 'interactive' features present on the DVD releases are missing. This is not understandable or expected because greater interactivity is one of Blu's selling points.
- All the other DVD features are present on the Blu releases but they are all unchanged - the same low resolution.
- No new special features were added to the Blu releases. Not even the invitation to access the movie's Web site wasn't translated into a hyperlink and there is no BD-Live.

Rating
=====
The bundle is definitely recommended to anyone who hasn't bought the Harry Potter movies on DVD already if one can't wait for 2 more years to get the complete 7-movie pack that MIGHT benefit from a special Blu facelift.

For someone like me, who already has the DVD copies, it was a 'maybe'. I took advantage of a deep discount opportunity at Amazon and I don't regret my purchase. I will probably try to resell my single 'Order of the Phoenix' Blu copy and the individual years 1-4 on DVD.

Overall, this bundle can't get the 5-star 'exceptional' rating but earns a solid 4 stars because, while the movies themselves are presented well, nothing special was done to add to the original DVD special features, to enhance the existing ones or to take advantage of any Blu-ray specific capabilities.",1249171200,,2522,4.7949308755760365
3536622,5,B001DPHDJ2,Just recieved my 5 set Harry Potter discs. I got all 5 movies. Great set and nicely packaged. I know some people are waiting for a complete set.

Yes, I'd seen the previous movies, but the opportunity to review them all at once just before going to see the newest one with my grandsons (and at a price lower than the tickets for that excursion are going to cost) was just too good an opportunity to miss.  And the movies, viewed back to back over several days (an experience somewhat like an Opera Buff seeing the entire Ring Cycle in a marathon?) was a true immersion.

3536624,5,B001DPHDJ2,"Harry Potter is a wizard in many more ways then one - his magic apparently transcended what happened in the books and enthralled the readers, especially the young ones.

The movies prove that although the task was enormous the directors of these five movies coped with it more then OK. No expenses were spared, the casting was more than impressive, the directors were found who knew their job, the locations are formidable (there are few places quite as picturesque as Scotland, aren't there?), what else could you ask?
If you don't have these DVDs already get them for your kids and you will have some fun as well. The price is more than appealing (let's face it, you're getting a movie in Bluray - uneven to be frank, don't hope for perfection with the first movies - for the price of a cinema ticket!) so why wait?

3536628,5,B001DPHDJ2,"My focus here is more on the Blu Ray and this package than the 5 movie plots.

First off the package physically is small.  Each movie comes in a case that is about half the size of a normal Blu Ray case.  I like the smaller cases so much that I wish all Blu Rays came in the small case.  It is such a space saver and we REALLY appriciate that aspect alone.

Each movie has loads of special features and behind the sceens content.  So even though we have a smaller case for rach disk, they are packed full of goodies.

Coming from the normal DVD's another aspect we really liked was not having to have multiple disks for each movie.  Call me lazy but I hate to be interupted in the middle of a film to have to insert a new disk.  So we really appriciate that as well.

One thing lacking was each case was rather plain on the inside.  The first two movies on DVD had a lot of nice decoration and such but their Blu Ray counter parts were pure business with no thrills or even a sceen selection index.  I personally enjoy that type of thing but it is a minor detail really.

Picture quality which is what REALLY counts here is 110% amazing.  The detail is jaw dropping to the point it grabs you and pulls you into the film leaving the feeling that you are there.  We watched them on our Samsung LN52B750.

If you like this series and want to know if the jump from DVD to the Blu Ray is worth it then I would highly recomend this set to you assuming you have a TV to take advanatage of the quality.",1248912000,,1494,4.065068493150685

I immediately opened the package and went for the 5th DVD. I placed it in the DVD player and felt an early sense of disappointment, because right away the ""preview/special features"" started playing. However, I pressed the MENU button on my DVD player and the movie menu came up. I pressed play and the Order of the Phoenix began to play. With that being said, it appears the issue has been resolved. Also, perhaps people were quitting too early on the 5th DVD because of the initial startup sequence?",1248825600,,806,4.643356643356643

Finally was able to start watching again at beginning of Chapter 20 and the rest of the DVD played perfectly.  We then tried the same DVD in all the other DVD players in the house and had the exact same issues in the exact same chapters.

The collection consists of the movies only, pretty straight-forward. Had no problems with delivery. All movies intact. Exactly as expected. GREAT PRICE $32 (June 2009 promotion) which translates to about $6 a film. Even if you didn't enjoy the earlier installments, it was worth it for the DVD library. Looks good on our new television even without HD (high definition).

My first review was true (and I was slightly emotional), but now I happy to say that we are the proud parents of 5 perfectly healthy Harrys. Thank you for righting this wrong. :)

[Initial review from last week: I just received my order, foolishly thinking that Amazon would have straightened out the apparently prolific missing disc issue. I was wrong, however. Future buyers beware and know that you will be receiving a falsely advertised item if you order this now. To really know that this problem has been fixed, Amazon should make a statement and apologize for endorsing a damaged product. You can mess with many things, but you can't mess with Harry Potter!

They were nice; but we weren't really that interested in all the extra stuff on the second disc. For us this fine 5 disc set was a more reasonable, cost effective way, of owning the Potter movies. And yes it has even got me interested in what is going to happen to Harry next. Sorry I'm not one who can sit and read a book for hours on end. My attention span isn't that long. On the other hand a good movie can get me to thinking about doing it.

I had ordered this as a good deal for my son who really wanted to get the movie.  I hadn't thought to read the reviews until after I ordered, and was dismayed at the almost universal problem of Order of the Phoenix, the movie itself, missing in lieu of the special features disc.  So, I told my son it was probably only the first four movies, so he wouldn't be disappointed.

But, lo and behold, disc 5 appeared to be correct, and the actual movie, but, after all the posts, decided to check it to be sure, and, it was the movie!

So, that makes the set a great deal, instead of a good deal.  Be aware of the apparent problem, but also beware that it's apparently not universal, or maybe it's fixed.",1237161600,,937,4.381502890173411

We also recently bought a blu-ray player and so we went searching for this extended version of the movie.  What we found was this collection of 1-5 that promised ""Additional scenes"" for every movie.  Don't be fooled.  The ""Additional scenes"" is the same package of ""deleted scenes"" that comes with every Harry Potter movie.  There were no additional scenes in the movies themselves.

3536714,1,B001DPHDJ2,I should have read the reviews before buying!! AHHHH! Don't do it!! They will only refund 20% if the cost ($6). Very disappointing!,1234310400,,131,4.739130434782608

3536716,3,B001DPHDJ2,Year 5 was not the movie.  Instead it was Special Features.  We sent it back and ordered another one and it was the same thing.  Amazon ended up giving us $10 refund.,1234051200,,166,4.125
3536717,2,B001DPHDJ2,"I had the same thing happen.  I bought this for my son, promising him he could watch each movie after he read each book.  Well, he finished book five, but no movie, just the special features disc.  Very annoying.",1234051200,,212,4.384615384615385
3536718,5,B001DPHDJ2,"Blu-ray is so crystal clear, and these movies are so wonderful, the combination of the two are unbeatable. Not to mention, we got a SUPERB price from Amazon, so what's not to like.

We enjoyed all 5 of the movies, but I think that year 5 is my fav so far. Of course, once the final two years are released, I may have to change my mind. I highly recommend all of these movies, and if you get the chance, you should also read the books.",1233878400,,434,4.046511627906977
3536719,5,B001DPHDJ2,"This gift set with its clever packaging and extra ""surprises"" inside was quite a hit with our family.

We would highly recommend this fantastic set for all Harry Potter collectors!",1233878400,,279,4.673469387755102
3536720,4,B001DPHDJ2,"Needless to say, the movies are quite entertaining.  I was interested to see each of the movies after having read the books.  Great service from Amazon.  Never a worry there.  Only 4 stars because the last (5th) movie didn't play all the way through.  It started to hang up somewhere in the middle, so I watched that one from another copy that we had.  Wasn't worth the hassle to try to exchange it.  Thanks again, Amazon.",1233792000,,422,4.473684210526316
3536721,1,B001DPHDJ2,"This is my 2nd set of DVD's: the first set all 5 discs were loose inside the sealed case and scratched up - so I did not watch any of them to verify a problem with Disc 5 having or not having the movie on it.  Amazon immediately sent me a replacement set in exchange for my scratched up set.  The new set Disc 5 does not have the movie on it, and Amazon has told me,

""Please let me apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced as a result of this particular order.

I'm sorry to hear that you experienced the same problem with your replacement shipment.

3536723,2,B001DPHDJ2,"I ordered this set because my children had lost the 2nd movie and the 4th one decided it no longer wanted to play in our main DVD player. Disc 1 was so scratched up, it looked like someone had let their cat use it as a claw-sharpener, and the 5th disc was only bonus features. Amazon apologized & replaced it promptly, but the 2nd set I received also had a 5th disc that was only bonus features. After realizing this was a common complaint, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, to which the WB manufacturer (address on box) has not yet responded. False advertising,  unprofessional? You be the judge. I just found out this set of discs is no longer being made. Hmm, I wonder why?!?",1233619200,,697,4.403100775193798

If they never get to make the next movies, if a drastic cast change happens or if the production company drops it all -- I will have regrets not buying this set. For what it is now, I still give it high reviews but I'll keep my few remaining greenbacks for gasoline and food.",1233187200,,436,4.022988505747127

The disc sleeve is for the movie, but the disc inside is wrong. This is a manufacturer error and not a problem with the product listing. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a postage paid return shipping label and will refund my money.

Pros are obvious as the price cannot be beat. Cons are, it comes in a box that doesn't fit in your everyday DVD rack and the trunk appears to be a tad flimsy so you need to be carefull. Great product however, I would recomend it!",1232928000,,398,3.925925925925926

Upon calling Amazon and speaking to someone on the phone, they are conveniently ""out"" of the boxed sets for an exchange.  But when I go back in as a new customer on the website, I'm able to buy the set again and they have it in stock.  I think they know what's up and just don't want to send out another faulty set to someone who already complained, but for a new customer, they don't mind sending them the faulty boxed set.

Anyway, they offered me a full refund if I ship the product back or a 20% credit ($7) to my account and I keep the set.  I took the latter option and wanted to let everyone know they are offering the $7 credit.",1232755200,,753,4.08843537414966

I am very frustrated with amazon and will not buy from them in the future if I can help it.  It is not acceptable to send the wrong disk; it is deceitful.  I don't know how they think that this is acceptable.  Many other complaints about this problem have been voiced, yet nothing has been done.",1232668800,,557,4.2075471698113205

All the movies have been given the standard Blu-ray treatment: interactive menus, in-depth interviews and features, along with stunning, razor sharp images and crystal clear, Dolby Digital True-HD sound. It's the stuff that Blu-ray is known for and it's been put together quite nicely in this fabulous set.  If you're a fan of Harry Potter, you already know the movies.  But, if you already own a Blu-ray player or simply need an excuse to buy one, this is a great set to get you started in viewing movies in their true HD glory!",1232236800,,688,4.764705882352941

Someone thought it would be a cute idea to put the movies in a ""trunk"" but unfortunately the velcro strap breaks upon opening and the so called new disk of extra features aren't even in HD. The trunk doesn't sit on the shelf properly because of its odd shape. If you have not purchased the films, then buy them separately in Blu-ray and skip the overpriced packaging.",1231891200,,472,4.5

I would highly recommend potential buyers go to a local store and inspect the package before purchasing this DVD set.  DO NOT BUY ONLINE OR FROM AMAZON.  Unfortunate because they are such great films and packaged for the holidays.  If anybody wants to trade a disk 3 for a disk 2, look me up.",1231891200,,416,4.294871794871795

But what I did not expect to be included were the extra items such as the DVD game and the HP Bookmarks, what a treat.  I highly recommend this package to any HP fan that has Blu-Ray capability, it is well worth the cost.",1227916800,,494,4.590909090909091

The bookmarks that are included are METAL, not paper or plastic.  The trading cards are well packaged (for those of you who are collectors), the movies are in folders by HOGWART'S YEAR, not movie title (perfect for those who want to watch each movie in chronological order).  The case that this set is enclosed in is a miniature version of Harry Potter's steamer trunk from the movie, complete with the Hogwarts and Gryffindor emblems and the initials HP and the clasps and hinges are real, not plastic.

3536783,3,B001DPHDJ2,"Disclaimer:  I do not own this set.  I looked at it closely at a friend's house.

First of all, the good stuff:  Beautiful transfer to Blu-Ray, with gorgeous sound.  A very visible improvement over the standard DVD release.

Now the bad stuff:  Apparently some HD DVD discs were inadvertently shipped in the early boxes.  No doubt WB will tidy that up.  In the meantime, it would make sense to open the box where you buy it and check before you go home, explaining to the clerk why you are doing so.

The box is an imitation of HP's trunk.  Nice, I guess, if you are a True Believer and go for that sort of thing.  The innards are cheesy and if you don't want to keep the trunk you'll have to round up some Blu-Ray cases or end up with odd-sized little thingies on your DVD rack.

I agree with the reviewer who pegged this as an impulse buy.  Might as well pick up the individually packed movies as this can be done for the same total cost.  That is, if you can choke back the tears at not getting the bookmarks and trading cards.....  Then you can buy the 7-disc set in a couple of years and give it to your fave fanboy/girl.

Five stars for the quality of the images and sound.  One star for pandering to the gotta-haveits.",1221436800,,1225,4.229437229437229

The box set is cute looking. However the trunk is not leather or pleather or even vinyl, its card board. The trunk had no handle to hold when carrying, so if you have small hands you'll need to use both.
You will have to keep the plastic insert inside of the trunk because the movies don't fit right without it. The movies inside are not in sealed cases, but in book-like cases. There is no extra room inside the trunk for when the other movies come out to put them inside.

Over all its not as good as the pictures make it look. But its still a cute little trunk, and comes with some cards, envelope holders, and a letter opener.",1220400000,,734,4.161971830985915

I didn't think it would make much of a difference, but luckily I decided to exchange.  The Blu-ray format makes watching the movie a lot more pleasurable.  It is most impressive when you can see the thread in tapestry.  As for Harry Potter itself, the movies are a lot of fun.  I love a movie that can take you into a world full of imagination.  It really is a great pleasure to also be able to watch all movies back to back and watch as the cast grows from their youth to young adults.  It is enjoyable to see all the relationships develope and to be able to experience all that the characters have gone through.  The book marks that come with the box set are also of great quality.",1219795200,,779,4.216216216216216

The bonuses are great, the bookmarks are beautiful, and the collectible cards are really cute.  It is nice that they are all self-contained in the ""trunk"" as well.  The only complaint I have, and it is really very nit-picky, is that the size of the cases for all of the movies are not the same.

I thought it was 2 pretty good movies and 3 mediocre, forgettable movies.  If it were standard box set packaging, I'd give this series 3 stars, but I like the little suitcase packaging, it's well made, so that bumps it up to 4 stars.",1202688000,,551,3.6440677966101696

3536840,5,B001DPHDJ2,"As a pragmatist I've come to the inevitable conclusion that HD-DVD is a obsolete format and that probably I'll never get the last 2 movies from this series in HD-DVD. Realistically they won't be available in Blu Ray either as all the old fashioned optical disc delivery formats seem to be inevitably doomed to fail. However if like me you have a HD-DVD and you are thinking of getting your money out of it in the short term, this box set is the one. All the films are fabulously transferred to HD and the latter ones feel even better. My next task is to keep my HD player safe as in a few years I suspect I'll not be able to get a replacement to watch these films if it gets knackered. Ce la Vie!",1202169600,,696,4.162962962962963

3536842,5,B001DPHDJ2,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire & Order of the Phoenix were all at minimum very good. Certainly Socerer's Stone, Chamber and Goblet of Fire are as 5-star as it gets. Azkaban was relatively slow compared to the others, and the most recent, Order of the Phoenix, was also a bit drawn out, but still great.

The A-list actors giving A-list performances goes on and on in this series of films....You have Richard Harris (GRHS) who was flawlessly and un-noticably (no disrespect intended) replaced by Michael Gambon; Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman, there's Alan Rickman doing his best Jeremy Irons imitation, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Shirley Henderson, John Cleese and of course Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.

Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Alone/dp/B00008N6NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home Alone</a>&nbsp;and tons more). And the cast of these films?...How often do three unknowns (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley) walk into overnight stardom? Not very often. But these three sure did. And it's well deserved. Their characters are well acted and believable; not bad for a bunch of preteens whose debuts now seem so long ago.

Azkaban was really good and certainly an integral part of the Harry Potter progression of stories. But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuarn (prior to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men/dp/B000N6TX1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men</a>). Columbus still had oversight as a producer to Azkaban, so perhaps Cuarn felt intimidated by Columbus' brilliance in Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber...or perhaps Cuarn just held back from doing his own thing. Be that as it may, the change in ""direction"" really showed through. And Cuarn was gone for Goblet.

Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuarn back to another vet in Mike Newell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Brasco/dp/B000NQPZCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Brasco</a>), 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.

The Dirctor's Chair went back to a relatively inexperieced Daid Yates for Order of the Phoenix, but Yates stayed the course started by Newell and kept the darkness (and the PG-13) in.

It must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating starting with Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Harry Potter movies. How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Vs-Predator/dp/B000K0YLLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Vs. Predator</a>, that does indeed not only have profanity, but strong violence? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to ""protect"" our youth.

I will indeed finish by saying that the first five Harry Potter releases combined have grossed close to $3,000,000,000 (that's a three BILLION dollars) because they're excellent movies that kids can watch too. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, MPAA.

If you somehow missed these movies, I hope that my long-winded review has encouraged you to add them to your cart. I can't wait for the upcoming 2008 continuation of the Harry Potter series with Half-Blood Prince and finally Deathly Hallows announced for 2010.",1201824000,,4166,5.6544
3536843,5,B001DPHDJ2,"This is the most amazin box set that I've hever seen, the bookmarks are incredibles. For your information all the movies have subtitles and audio in english and spanish, but number three only have subtitles in spanish and audio in english and french.

I recomended 100%.",1201737600,,270,4.869565217391305
3536844,4,B001DPHDJ2,"I agree with a lot of reviewers, this box set is premature.  No doubt there will be a fantastic set once the seventh film is released on DVD - in 2011.  That said, this is a beautiful release.  And, those that don't already have the first 5 films and now want them should look at this set.  I luckily received it as a Christmas gift.  I already have all the DVD individual releases, but I was delighted when I saw this.

The box is designed to look like Harry's trunk.  And as such, it is filled with his ""school books.""  The individual films come in sleeves that look like a book, and like books they are different sizes.  A ribbon goes around them.  The chest is very nice quality (far superior to the trunk the HP book set comes in!) with a hinged lid.  The ""bonuses"" are very nice - especially the metal book marks.  The trading cards are pretty, if useless.  I haven't played the DVD game, and likely won't, but it is a nice extra for younger fans.  The features content is what interested me, and it's well done.  Overall, this set is worth buying if you can get it discounted.

Will I buy the ultimate set when the 7th film is released?  Yes, I'm one of those suckers the studio is targeting.  And another lucky member of my family will inherit a nice boxed set of HP for their collection.",1201651200,,1296,4.2633744855967075
3536845,5,B001DPHDJ2,"Some people have had issues with the Harry Potter Films because they don't follow the novels.  My argument is just look at the movies as just that movies and not focus on the books that the films are based from the books.  I'm not going into any detail about each film because I believe that would be very dull and spoil a lot of the fun of watching the movies.  Whether you have a standard DVD Player, an HD-DVD Player, or a Blu-ray player this is a must have if you like a fantasy film, a dramatic film, or if you are a fan of the books and still like the movies.  The hi-def transfer is perfect on these dics and the sound is terrific as well.  As for Special Features each film disc has it's own bonus features.  Such as, deleted scenes, filmmakers interviews, the usual stuff that comes with the movies if one bought them seperately (which by the way comes to about the same price, if you are wondering.) It also comes with a DVD Interactive game which didn't really interest me much.  Finally, it comes with bookmarks and a special DVD with a lot of television specials from the BBC and from HBO.

Lame, lame, lame. Buy the individual titles separately in my opinion. Limited edition my foot!

There is a DVD game (you can play on your DVD player with the remote), a wizard card collection (OK, bit of a yawn here) and a collection of five bookmarks. The bookmarks are high quality metal and should last several lifetimes of reading to future generations of HP fans. I would put a $20 value on the bookmarks alone.

We currently have an upscale DVD player and the difference between that and the HD is minimal at best.  We have a 46"" 720p TV, though I heard 1080p is not that big of an improvement either.

The cards are cool and come in a cute little envelope. But the coolest bit i think is the bookmarks. I just showed my sisters boyfriend and he said he would buy the set purely for these. The quality of the films is also phenomenal. I couldn't believe this one bit i watched, the part in goblet of fire with the boot portkey. You can actually see the creases in the leather.

3536917,4,B001DPHDJ2,"This set is a must-have for serious HP fans who have an HD player. This boxset includes the first 5 movies in HD (each with most of the extra bonuses that came in the 2-disc special editions), a very well-done bookmark set, a good collection of collectible cards, an interactive game DVD, and a bonus material DVD.

The HD is a noticeable upgrade from the standard quality - they did really well in that aspect. The interactive gaming DVD is alright, but mostly for the younger audience. My only qualm with the DVDs themselves falls on the bonus DVD. Most of the bonus material is really interesting and great, but my DVD had an error under the bonus material for the 5th movie. There are supposed to be two specials, but after the intro for each special, the same material plays. Whoops? Maybe they'll send replacements for the disc at a later date. The extras are a great bonus, especially the bookmarks.

The box is pretty sturdy so unless you are very clumsy, have a short temper and throw it around, or have destructive kids/pets then the box will hold up just fine. The clasps on this boxset are metal and not plastic (as the ones on the recent boxset of the HP books - or so I heard). If you remove the box of bookmarks, you will have enough room for the last two movies to fit in here, which is great. I'm really curious though as to why the cases for the first two movies are about half the size of the rest. If you are anal like me, this may urk you a tad.

Besides the bonus disc error and the weird half-sizing of the cases for the first two movies, this boxset is perfect. It's also at a super great price, compared to if you had bought each movie in HD separately.",1198886400,,1678,4.30379746835443
3536918,4,B001DPHDJ2,"This really isn't a bad deal at all given the individual price of the movies. However, if you're only interested in the movies and not the box set, then try to take advantage of the buy one get one free offer from Amazon. I wasn't planning to get these movies until much later next year, but after seeing that offer it was more like a reflex to purchase all 5 movies. I may not have the box, but I sure got the set. I already have 10 HD-DVDs and that doesn't include these movies nor the 5 free movies. So far all of them look spectacular on the HD-A30. I expect these to be no different. Now all I want is a Lord Of The Rings HD-DVD collection and I'm good.

OMG! I just had to come back and add to this review. I'd move this from a 4* to a 5*. Simply unbelievable. I bought the individual movies instead of the box set, but it should be the same. Using the HD-A30 (HD-DVD player) in 1080p/24 and my LN-T4671F (HDTV) with Auto Motion Plus on High, it feels like I'm on the set watching them make the movie. The more you watch HD content, the more you realize how big of a jump it is from standard DVDs, much less coming from a standard TV. If you're a fan, then you should already have these movies. While I'm not really a big fan but simply like movies, I'll have to say that this year is off to a great start. With that said, these aren't the only set of HD movies I have. I also have Planet Earth, Riddick, Transformers, Matrix collection, Bourne collection, etc. If you trying to decide on whether to get the HD version vs the Standard version, take my advice. Get the HD version.",1198713600,,1585,4.1294498381877025
3536919,5,B001DPHDJ2,I am not sure why so many reviews are based on the fact that another boxed set has come out.  People should remember you are rating the product not the product company's intention to make money.  That's what they do.  This boxed set is wonderful!  My son has recently become a fan and this is exactly what we hoped it would be.  I was surprised by how nice the bookmarks were and the cards were a big hit too.  You definitely get your money's worth!,1198713600,,449,4.223529411764706

3536921,3,B001DPHDJ2,"I was so excited to get this set on Hi Def. Well, the first film S.S. doesn't play at all. My player makes a clicking noise and won't read the disc. The rest work fine but I also noticed that C.O.S. looks like it isn't HD. The box's fastener was all bent up and didn't lock in that well. The velcro ""book belt"" was glued to the top dvd and couldn't be removed without tearing off the surface of the cover.

I got a replacement because of the disc on (S.S.) not playing and once again it DOESN'T PLAY! I'm giving up asking for another 3rd replacement so i'll just buy the individual blu-ray disc. You'd think that a Limited Collectors Edition would have better quality assurance but whatever. Too many things are made out of the country and are poorly made and or have lead paint in them. I don't want to pay good money for junk or to get poisoned.",1198281600,,847,4.228395061728395
3536922,4,B001DPHDJ2,"I was expecting all the ""extras"" that came with this to be low quality - but was pleasantly surprised. The 5 bookmarks that came with it are made of metal and actually look very nice. The trunk is sturdy cardboard with metal hinges - but it looks nice and I am using it to hold some of my knick-knacks. It also comes with some trading cards in the envelope that Harry's Hogwarts acceptance letter was in.

The ""3 Hours of Special Content"" was unimpressive. There wasn't really any new or interesting content. It is just a bunch of TV specials that review what happened in the movies.

If you want the 2-disc special editions of all five movies this is a great purchase... and cheaper than buying them all separately. But if you already own the first four movies there is obviously no point in buying this.",1198195200,,805,4.469387755102041

Inside the exterior ""trunk"", the disks come in two different sizes of folding cases that do not at all resemble a product family.  You're really stuck storing all of the disks in this case forever because none of the disks has sufficient labeling to be on the shelf by themselves.

For uniformities sake, I'd much have preferred to buy the 5 blu-ray disks individually- especially knowing that another three movies will have to be purchased to complete this ""set"" in the future.",1198108800,,565,4.686868686868687

3536926,4,B001DPHDJ2,"My husband and I pre-ordered this collection and boy, were we surprised when we opened the box!  I was expecting the discs to be in regular cases but  they are instead in  cases of differing sizes, meant to resemble books.  This is interesting but not particularly practical as the cases can not be closed properly and when laid flat the cover sticks up a bit.  It's a pity also that the bonus DVD is not in blu-ray.
That being said however, the picture quality apprears excellent (as I expected) from the quick look I had at the first one, and the movie started playing right away (a a bonus if, like me you hate waiting for all the initial junk about copyright etc that usually comes on first).  Pressing the menu button showed that there is indeed more than just the movie on the disc, the are deleted scenes and all the other fun stuff of the special editions.
So overall, I would recommend it as a good buy.  I think though that using the same artwork from these cases, on regular sized plastic cases that can be closed, would be better.",1197936000,,1042,4.395833333333333
3536927,4,B001DPHDJ2,"This is a fabulous set.  The movies look great.  The bonuses in the box were nice little surprises.  I'm especially fond of the bookmark collection, which is just charming.  What a great gift for any Harry Potter fan!  Well worth the money!",1197936000,,240,4.619047619047619
3536928,4,B001DPHDJ2,"I would have loved to give this one a five star rating but I would be in denial to do so.  First of all let me say for better or for worse I really enjoy all five of the Harry Potter movies.  Sure I wish the last two films were longer but realistically it's impossible to convert a 700 plus page book into a movie that's two hours and change.

For the most part the movies here look spectacular.  For the most part.  ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" looks really good. But for the price of a BD movie it should look a lot better.  The rest of the catalogue looks terrific however, especially Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

As others have stated the packaging is rather cumbersome.  I would have preferred the movies be in their regular blue cases as opposed to the cases that are different sizes.  Still, I am sure most collectors will be happy with this set.  Although it's not perfect, this set will probably make any Harry Potter fan fortunate enough to own a Blu Ray player happy.",1197676800,,1004,4.320855614973262

But...when I played disc #1 of the new ""limited edition"", first of all we could not delete the closed captioning which is very distracting if you don't need it.  Second, (having seen the movies before,)  I could tell some scenes were elminated, so I think that was very poor on their part.  Disc #5 was horrible in the sense that there was fully 10 of commercials and coming attractions before the movie even started!!  If you are paying for a DVD, I don't think you should have to pay to watch commercials also!  I was not very happy with this ""limited edition""",1197676800,,641,4.530434782608696

3536931,5,B001DPHDJ2,"And to think all I wanted was a deal on the movies in HD...

For starters, you know this set is going to be different when you notice the metal latch and metal hinges.

Popping the lid reveals a plastic protector holding the discs in place, all bound in a ribbon like old style school-books. The discs for the first 2 movies come in CD sized cardboard sleeves, also made to look like school-books. The remaining films are in standard DVD sized cardboard sleeves.

In addition to the 5 HD-DVD movies, there are 2 regular DVDs one for special features on all the films and a DVD-based Harry Potter game.

But the real surprise (for me) was at the bottom of the box.

Besides the replica envelope with Harry Potter themed trading cards, is a very nice little box of bookmarks. Each bookmark is made of polished metal and has a different theme. One is a replica of Harry's broom. Another represents the snitch. Another is an owl delivering a letter.

These are all heavy, quality bookmarks, beautifully rendered in 3 dimensions. I was very surprised to find them as a ""bonus"" when they could easily be sold on their own.",1197590400,,1116,4.527363184079602
3536932,5,B001DPHDJ2,The packaging of this special edition is just beautiful. The HD DVD cases are of different size and shape because they were meant to look like books.

3536933,3,B001DPHDJ2,"Folks, I'm awaiting delivery on the Blu-Ray set of this collection and am concerned about one thing: reports are that Warner Bros. inadvertently included the 4th movie, Goblet of Fire, as an HD DVD and not a Blu-Ray DVD. Therefore, of the 5 movies in this set, DVDs 1-3 and 5 are, indeed, Blu-Ray, but DVD #4 is HD DVD, obviously incompatible for those with solely a Blu-Ray player. Worse, the same reports state that Warner Bros. has not decided to do anything replacement-wise on this, leaving customers in the dark for now.

Has anyone who ordered this set in Blu-Ray experienced this, or are all 5 DVDs in fact, Blu-Ray discs?",1197504000,,630,4.625

I was going to wait until all the movies were filmed and put on DVD and then buy the complete boxed set, but as I want to watch the movies now, I figured that for the cost of buying each individual movie I might as well buy the boxed set. I'm glad I did. The packaging is a lot nicer than I expected, and each disk comes in a more maturely designed case than the individual DVDS. The bookmarks are gorgeous, and I'm looking forward to trying out the games. I will end up buying another boxed set in a few years, but this is how they get you, and I just accept it and enjoy the ride.

I loved all five movies so far, and I'm looking forward to watching all of them again along with the extras.",1197504000,,795,3.96875
3536935,3,B001DPHDJ2,I was really looking forward to this release as I am a huge BD fan. When it finally came though I was a little let down. First the Sorcerers Stone looks more like an upscaled DVD then a real Blu-ray (BD). As you progress in the series the quality gets better but it starts kinda bad. By the time you reach Order of the Phoenix its as it should be with BD. Couple that with a very awkward box and you get a very average box set. Im still wrestling with how i want to display this odd shaped box.,1197504000,,494,3.95

3536937,3,B001DPHDJ2,"First off, there's plenty of box, or trunk space, in the set. They clearly left enough room for movies 6 and 7, especially since there's about an inch inside the trunk which is just cardboard fluffer. So can anyone explain why on earth, movies 1 and 2 come in CD size sleeves, and movies 3, 4, and 5 come in regular dvd size sleeves which fit nice and snug inside the case.  The smaller sleeves for movie 1 and 2 are just free-floating inside the trunk and bound to get rattled around in carrying the trunk. This just defies reason. Obviously this review has nothing to do with the movies themselves, but the packaging is fair game especially on a ""Limited Edition Gift Set"".",1197417600,,675,4.443548387096774

i only checked out one of the dvds so far which was prisoner and it looks amazing. i had to check out my favorite scene where the dementors come inside the train, and that looked beautiful then i checked out the scenes in the snow cause snow always looks awesome in hd

and if any of you were wondering, there is no dual layer skip on the part where harry is using the map and snape catches him, i always hated that on the standard dvd",1197417600,,623,3.8217054263565893

The box itself looks and feels like an old piece of luggage and there are lots of fun things inside. Each movie comes as a two disc set enclosed in  a case resembling a text book. There are two extra ""books"", the interactive DVD game and an disc full of Harry Potter extras (various short documentaries for each film).

In addition to the DVDs, the box also contains trading cards and bookmarks. The cards are very cool, but the bookmarks are the highlight of the extras. They are of metal construction and are very detailed. There are bookmarks of Hedwig, Harry's Broom, a Golden Snitch, Gryffindor Shield, and Voldemort's Prophecy.

If you don't want to wait until after The Deathly Hallows or you just want a really impressive set to collect, I highly recommend you pick this up.",1197417600,,971,4.468926553672317

But this one is well worth the money and the price is right. It will cost you just as much later to pickup the other 4 movies @ 20 bucks a pop then to pickup this set and you are getting a lot more. Not only is the movie quality outstanding, they did an awesome job on the packaging and extra things that come with it. This is a must for any HD DVD owning Harry Potter fan out there.",1197331200,,512,3.9805825242718447

These sets contain the first five years of Harry Potter as never seen before, on blu-ray disk, collector cards in an envelope identical to the one Harry received in the first movie, a fun game DVD, a soundtrack, an amazing beautiful bookmark set and a lot more packed in an amazing chest looking box.  This box set would make a great present to a loved one or to oneself, and it be enjoyed for years to come, like never before on the exceptional Blu-ray format.",1197331200,,540,4.39
3536943,5,B001DPHDJ2,"While I'm new to HD DVD's, from the few I've seen, I'm very impressed with this set. Going from the first 2 movies seen so far, the graphics are VERY crisp and clear, so much though that sometimes you can see the difference between live actors and the CGI sets, something more blurred out from the less sharp DVD's.

The sound is great, after watching 'Phantom of the Opera' by ALW, I was a little disappointed in its sound, and was hoping that the HP set was not as bad, and I was happy to find that the sound was great!

Extras, the three plus hours of extras on the bonus DVD is nice, there's a card set that's like the cards in the 'Chocolate Frogs' which comes in the envelope invitation to Hogwarts in the first movie. A very impressive bookmarker set within with a flying broom letter opener, three bookmarker in the shape of a owl, seeker ball and the snake symbol from the second movie as well as a Gryffindor badge. All in steel and would I think cost a bit if sold separately.

It all comes in a nice box that's shaped like Harry's trunk, everything nicely packaged and sweet. As for the price, if your want all five movies you're already looking at $130+ for the HD versions, so if you can afford it, this is a cheaper way to go and one of the better Limited Edition Box Set's as I've seen, whether it's HD, regular DVD's or VHS.",1197331200,,1341,4.250980392156863

Get this gift set (got mine on sale at Best Buy for 100bux) and I am not disappointed.

I watched one and 2 and the picture quality is a lot better...not as much noise and grain in the pics and when you pop in 5 you can see how much better the film quality has come since the first one.

The Audio is great if you don't mind waking your neighbors....

Now to answer some of the questions:  these are NOT Combo disks...this is HD DVD format only. Are there extra features?  Plenty and even a bonus disk with even more extra content.

I will when time allows watch the  5th disk with the In movie focus feature....

But either way if you want the best Potter experience...get this set....",1197331200,,739,4.184397163120567

My only quibble, which kept this from 5 stars is the really odd packaging.  The value of the set is there, around $20 a film, but it is such an odd shape I'm not sure where to store it.  Inside of the trunk are the films, the DVD's resemble books and are different sizes, again quite odd.  Visually the set is appealing, but in all practicality it would be better off as regular discs.  Shave $20 off the price and package it like the superb Die Hard set and we would have a winner.",1197331200,,646,4.169354838709677

Personally, I own all the other movies and have them in two-disc editions and they don't even put deleted scenes on the second disc, except on the third one. Are they just going to keep repackaging each sequel as a box set with hours of HBO specials without ever selling the extended versions of the movies? Warner Bros. should take a page out of New Line Cinemas Home Entertainment and sell a boxed set with two-disc versions of the extended movies as was done with LOTR. That in my opinion would be a good marketing ploy!",1196640000,,640,4.38655462184874

3536955,3,B001DPHDJ2,"While I agree with several of the reviews in that it is frustrating to have a new limited edition released with each movie release, but it is ultimately the buyers choice whether to buy now or wait.  My main beef is that all of the DVD's are being released in widescreen.  My husband cannot watch widescreen movies...the wide screen causes problems with his vision.  Also, not everyone can afford, or even desires to own a widescreen tv.  However more and more movies and rental stores (such as hastings and movie gallery) are all widescreen.  This puts those people who do not desire to own widescreen movies in the minority, and therefor we do not get to enjoy a diverse and enjoyable video collection.  If you are going to take care to sell a dvd, especially a limited collection, in widescreen, hd dvd, and blue-ray you should certainly sell full screen!!!!",1195862400,,861,4.706666666666667

3536958,1,B001DPHDJ2,"First off, let me make a few things clear. By reviewing this, I am doing a few things I said I would never do. I've always said I would never review a product before it was formally released. I've also said I would never give a negative review based simply on packaging. However, I think I need to make an exception. My 1 star rating is based simply on the greediness of Warner Bros., et al. making a profit from the DVD sales of this product. It's always somewhat bothered me that they release both a single disc and a double disc version of a lot of movies. I would assume if they released only a double disc version (or possibly put all of the double disc features on the same disc as the movie, seeing as how they can supposedly fit so much data on a single disc without compromising quality), less cost would go into DVD production as well as less choices for the consumers, creating a lower price. However, as we can CLEARLY tell from this series, lower price for the consumer is not a priority. Currently on Amazon, they have sets available of the first 2, first 3, first 4, and first 5 movies. I understand that some don't purchase each movie as they are released, and some don't own any of the movies and want to catch up, but how can you expect this to be such an ongoing situation that you need to release a new `collection' every time a new movie is released to DVD. This new `limited edition' is the worst I've seen yet, as they realize the demand for `up to the current movie' collections are not high, so they throw in a few teasers as an attempt to draw fans who already have at least one copy of each movie. At Christmas time, no less, when parents are far more apt to spend money on something they've already bought. Personally, I find this absolutely appalling. The fact that this is currently in the top 500 in DVD sales on Amazon, I think speaks numbers for how easily they accomplish their job of taking our hard earned money. They have ad agencies and interest groups and a multitude of other means come up with the best and easiest ways to take our money, so why can't the consumers of America, ney, the world, stand together and boycott this flagrant disregard for us? I don't mean to attack just this series or Warner Bros., as it is occurring almost everywhere in the marketplace these days. Enough is enough though.",1194220800,,2343,4.363844393592677
3536959,4,B001DPHDJ2,"I like the movies and already have purchased the first four.

3536960,4,B001DPHDJ2,"I have to agree. As owner of the first four movies, and as I sit here watching an ""extended version"" on Disney channel, I would love to see WB come out with a set of the ""directors cuts"" or ""extended versions"".  I love the movies, but as I watch these extended versions, I can't help but think that I'm being cheated out of key scenes when I watch my theatrical versions.

3536964,5,B001DPHDJ2,"Obviously this boxset hasn't been released yet but wanted to share the following for any that may be thinking about it for the upcoming holidays.

Harry Potter hasn't been released in the US on HD DVD yet but one of the titles has been released for HD DVD in England last year. Since HD DVD is region free you can find online domestic retailers to purchases these imported discs.

I have to say this was the first imported title I ever purchased and was hesitant due to it being about $10 more then what I normally would pay but anxious to see Harry in High Def I purchased the movie from exploitedcinema.

This has definitely been one of my favorite movies in my collection for showing off HD DVD. Great picture quality and also including one of the first trueHD audio tracks for the format this is a great purchase.

The begining of the film shows the normal US Federal warning against pirating which has me wondering if the film has been encoded and ready for release for over a year now but as so many other titles held up by Warner waiting for Blu-ray to get there act together.",1192665600,,1083,4.4

I agree with the first review: too many boxed sets.  Unless they release extended editions as with Lord of the Rings, gonna pass...

PS My review also reflects my feeling for the movies.  4 & 5 were much better (as someone who hasn't read the books) than 1 & 2 and 3 was right in the middle.  Averages out to 4 for me (3+3+3.5+4+4.5 with a little rounding to be nice since my wife loves HP).",1192147200,,559,4.12962962962963
3536966,5,B001DPHDJ2,"I think -P- is missing the point. This is a Limited Edition. Warner has not done this for the Harry Potter releases on Region 1 before (other than the Fluffy collectible for the first film as full-screen only). The set is a complete redesign. There is no certainty (though it is more than likely) there may be another limited edition set. If you don't want it, don't buy it. As far as the Harry Potter sets go, this one is unique, and doesn't just simply throw the current releases into a cardboard slip case.",1191715200,,509,4.425531914893617
3536967,3,B001DPHDJ2,"Sometimes I just have to ask myself, ""why?"".

Why do they always market these boxed sets after each sequel of a successful movie? Now, don't get me wrong, I love watching the Harry Potter films. They are a wonderful excursion into a land of childhood make-believe and tell some great stories.

But after ""Chamber"", we had the two-boxed set. After ""Prisoner"", we had a three-boxed set. Following that with ""Goblet"" there was a four-boxed set. And now they are marketing a five-boxed set (for ""Phoenix)?

Unless you've never owned the DVDs (or are a maniac about getting every release available) there is little real purpose to buying a set like this, except maybe as a gift for someone. The bulk of us have purchased each film as it was released as I have. I don't think I need to spend another $80 to $100 to have another copy of a movie I already own. If a boxed set is to be released, it makes sense to me to wait until all seven of the films have been completed.

Well, folks, I gave this three stars because the movies (the films themselves rate 4 or 5 stars each) are enjoyable and well done (first two are the best in my humble opinion). The two stars I took away are for this release of what I see as a shameless marketing ploy.

Buy it if you will, you'll enjoy the films. But if you already have the DVDs then why bother? Me, I'll wait for the individual movie to be released and buy that.
