8080579,3,B000AYELWY,"Given the family likes Piper Perabo (""Coyote Ugly"", ""Imagine Me and You"", ""Covert Affairs"", and ""Lost and Delirious""), we had hopes for this.

Piper plays the part well, but the theme is depressing without much to say in general.  It lacks real comic relief anywhere, and lacks real message.",1367452800,,291,4.918367346938775
8080580,3,B000AYELWY,It was interesting to see Piper in a movie of this nature.  I guess everyone has to start somewhere.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not a Piper fan.,1363564800,,152,4.206896551724138

8080583,1,B000AYELWY,"Piper Perabo must be applauded for the breadth and scope of her choices of role. In the case of Perception, also applaud her for her sheer bravery (foolhardiness?) in taking on a script packed to bursting with ideas and disparate directions.
In this movie she is the emotionally unsettled daughter of a mentally unsound couple of paranoid obsessives. Piper gets to act her heart out, trying on every nuance at her disposal; unfortunately she cannot quite save this film which simply tries to take on too many issues. Let's list some of the ground the writing covers:
*Mental illness
*depression
*suicide
*drug abuse
*addiction
*HIV/AIDS
*ecology
*activism
*vegetarianism
*physical disability
*unemployment
*the penal system
*gay/lesbian issues
Arguably this movie is intended as a black comedy, but the overall mood of Perception is too brooding and depressed to work on this level most of the time. I think it could have been a gem if it just looked at one or two of the themes it addresses and looked at them well. Piper Perabo's presence and transparency are the only things that save Perception from completely being a drag, a well-known drag.",1349740800,,1147,5.010471204188482

This film is really, really bad. Save your time and skip it. It is the story of a young woman from a mentally ill family who seems either very dysfunctional or mentally ill herself. She has a few relationships with people she treats very poorly. She experiences a life-changing event and decides to value her relationships, but it appears to be too late. The movie ends in a very ungratifying, depressing way, consistent with the general tenor of the movie.

The acting is poor, the plot skips all over the place, and several things make no sense at all. Worst of all, after watching it, I felt quite depressed, and I didn't beforehand.

Definitely not recommended.

8080585,2,B000AYELWY,"Irving Schwartz, lighten up!  As writer and director of this strange little movie  he seems to have a weird perception of the world himself.  There is a limit to the punishingly sad story lines that can make it to film and this one clearly falls into that category.

Jen (Piper Perabo) is a funky, grossly outfitted bleach blond who has returned home from Los Angles to care for her emotionally disturbed parents (Mark Dobies and Mary Beth Hurt) but she seems to outdo any manifestation of their mental abnormalities.  She is stuck in a meaningless relationship with a female animal activist (Heather Burns) and trying to stave off her ex-boyfriend (Seth Meyers) while walking among friends like Aunjanue Ellis, a druggie, Ajay Naidu, a Pakistani importer, and a cop Nick Scotti.  She is struck by a truck and becomes paralyzed and seems to want to get a grip on her life, but her 'friends' don't go along.  To say more would waste what little interest there is to glean from this tale.

Those who have followed Piper Perabo's career may be hoping that this starring role may offer her the chance for a jump-start.  Sadly the script and atmosphere are so lacking that this film is probably one she will choose to not list on her resume. Grady Harp, September 06",1159488000,13,1261,4.669683257918552
8080586,1,B000AYELWY,"Wow, this movie was really really bad.  I'm a big Piper Perabo fan, thats why I made the mistake of buying this badly made, depressing film before renting.  She stars as Jen, a young woman with a bad attitude who just moved from LA back to NYC to live with her parents.  Her parents are both mentally ill and she spends most of her time tending to their needs.  Her social life is not very exciting either, she is constantly fighting off her ex boyfriend and ex girlfriend.  All of a sudden, she finds herself paralyzed after being hit by a truck.  Her bad attitude starts to change as she sees her old friends avoiding her once she is paralyzed.  She grows a heart of gold and tries to fix everything in her life, while those around her are suffering different issues, such as drug addiction and single motherhood.  With the exception of Perabo, the acting was ridiculous! No one in this film could act, especially Piper's ex girlfriend. The sequence of events were so unbelieveable and badly handled, I can't even begin to explain.  The ending is terrible as well.  This movie was actually categorized as a comedy? Thats funny, it's far from a comedy.  It is not only overly depressing, it also does not have a point.  Towards the middle of it, I thought maybe the point of it was ""believe in yourself and you can do anything"", then once it got ot the end, the point seemed more like ""all human beings are terrible, and life is not worth living"".  Thats what the ending really seemed to say.  Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this one, total waste of time.",1159401600,20,1568,4.437062937062937
