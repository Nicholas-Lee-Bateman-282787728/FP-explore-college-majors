4099656,5,B003A02O38,"This advanced course in urban warfare is truly remarkable for its advanced concepts, practical application, and real-time principles, tactics, and techniques. A ""must see"" for eality-based tactical warfare, police, and protective services trainers.",1307664000,,248,6.545454545454546
4099657,5,B003A02O38,"I have watched all the DVDs in this series and have even attended the training course. So I was not sure which ones to review, or all of them. So I decided to put this together as a general review for the rifle DVD and the Lotar DVD.

The instructors are excellent. The primary instructor comes from a unit in the IDF called Duvdevan (You can look that up separately). He speaks perfect English and has an engaging and friendly way about him. In each course I took he had with him different operators from the Israeli spec ops community. They were current operators on leave visiting with the lead instructor who they were friends with. The most interesting thing was that in one course there was a guy from the shabak (Israeli Secret Service), in one course a guy from the counter terror school, and in another course a guy from Matkal. They all worked exactly the same as if they had been teaching together all along. Their flow and methods all fit together even though they where from different units. Unlike other courses out there, these guys where current operators from Israel's best units, not just great marksmen, but soldiers through and through.

The video production and filming is not top of the line, but the instruction makes up for it. The course and DVD are both done in a ""Do what works and make it happen"" way. ""Close distance"", ""Engage the dominate threat"" ,""Visual confirmation"" were phrases we constantly heard.

The instruction format on the DVD is quite similar to the course. First a lot of dry drills then a live fire demo by the instructors. Every detail is explained and then demonstrated.

Safety is a number one concern for the instructors as they teach and explain everything. Constant safety briefings.

This DVD series does not feature students actually learning, like in the courses. It films only the instructors and demos. Although I am still not sure if the addition of actual students to the DVD would take away from it, or add to it.

The Lotar DVD teaches two man team tactics. It is assumed that the students are well versed in pistol combat and rifle combat before moving on to the Lotar DVD/course.  The team tactics depicted and taught take timing and precision. A pair would need to practice together in order to make it all work. The tactics in the Lotar DVD put operator safety first and follows a fire from the door frame pattern of work and technique.

I would have liked to see a disk that has only the drills on it. Meaning that the drills that are laced through the DVD and instruction could be a stand alone item. I would have liked that.

The course and training was designed to simulate real world experiences. The instructors combined both Krav Maga and shooting into one drill. This builds the fighting spirit and helps build the mind set. (To me ""Mind set"" is a PC way of saying ""Warrior brain washing necessary to fight and win"") They created real life urban warfare complex scenarios and had us fight our way through them. By the time we got to the firing line we where winded and had to fight our way through surprise targets and shoot/don't shoot scenarios.

The instructors where humble, nice, nurturing and kind. They had an answer for every question and tactical dilemma the students presented to them. They where young, fit and energetic. They were having fun as we were having fun. They had control of the class and proceeded to operate the live fire scenarios in a safe manner. I would recommend the DVD series and course to any one who is interested in defense, security, military training, martial arts or police work. A great course.",1297987200,,3604,4.6347962382445145
4099658,5,B003A02O38,"Very detailed explanations, I purchased this DVD after I attended the course associated with it. The course was amazing, it truly lifted my level of confidence. The DVD is a great training tool for anyone who has taken a course in Israeli CT training. It is as if Mr. Machine and company have developed a complete curriculum here with the book, DVDs and all the courses. I would defiantly recommend anyone who has done one of the courses to watch the DVDs. Otherwise the DVD is also good to give you a taste of what you might expect to do in the courses.",1297814400,,554,4.388349514563107
4099659,3,B003A02O38,"I was sooo excited to get this video...then I watched it.  I am pretty much disappointed with it.  First off, it's only about 32 minutes long.  I would have thought a video on this subject would have been at least twice that long.  I bought this video because I am an active shooter response instructor for the police department where I work and I was hoping to pick up few things.  Well, we do some things similar to what's shown in the video and we do some things very different.  However, this video was definitely dependent on working with the same person most, if all of the time.  That is very unrealistic for most police departments.  Before purchasing this video I read the reviews and this seemed to be a resource that I was looking for.  Unfortunately, it's not.  I can see where a novice in 2-person tactics may get something from this video, which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars rather 2 or even 1 star.",1285027200,9,921,4.364705882352941

4099661,5,B003A02O38,"From what I can see the Israeli method is a safe method. Each technique is based on having your battle buddy cover your 6. The system is all about using cover and firing from cover. The Israeli method is becoming very popular now in the US military. A unit in Israel called the YAMAM is seen using these exact methods depicted here in the DVD [...]

[...]

Also the US army Delta is using similar techniques that they train on together with the YAMAM in Israel. From what I have researched the method was first developed by the British SAS.",1278892800,,540,4.39
4099662,5,B003A02O38,"for a fairly short video, it certainly if chock full of information. to get the most out of the video, you need to watch each drill/exercise, pause the video, and then practice. the first time i watched it almost everything went over my head, but now that i've watched it about 3 times, i can now see the ""forest from the trees""",1278115200,,328,4.306451612903226
4099663,5,B003A02O38,"As a person that has trained in Israel, Garret Machine's video series does accurately represent the Israeli combat doctrines. For a person wanting to examine Israeli combat techniques the video series will fulfill that requirement. Could Mr. Machine have dressed more professional and used accurate labels describing weapon components? Yes, he could have and his video series would benefited from doing so. Nonetheless, the tactical information is accurate according to the Israeli combat doctrines. This is a rare look into how the Israelis fight terrorism.",1275350400,,558,5.576470588235294

8392706,4,B003A02O38,"The DVD is excellent.  It provides clear demonstrations of the most common room entries (standard door width, narrow and wide) and in addition addresses how to navigate other architectural features like hallways and stairwells.  The video provides two house clearing demonstrations that show you how to put the pieces together.  In addition there are techniques shown such as clearing malfunctions as part of a two man team, searching a suspect during a raid and how to implement a double arm-bar arrest. The instructors, Garret and Eli, provide excellent commentary on the techniques they are teaching.  They demonstrate the procedures clearly, and before going on to the next one, they anticipate viewers questions or correct potential errors before they happen.  Thats the essence of great instruction.",1520467200,,805,5.408

8392712,2,B003A02O38,"I purchased this video with few expectations. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with either the subject matter or the production quality. This is an amateur production that should not be mistaken for a quality training aid.  I deeply regret paying money for this item.

The reason I give this item two stars instead of one is because I don't exactly hate it. They are demonstrating one of the thousand ways to skin a cat. I do, however, feel that the item is underwhelming and overpriced. Again, I regret paying money for this item.  You determine for yourself if your curiosity is worth the money.",1388793600,,599,4.740384615384615
8392713,4,B003A02O38,"The material presented in this DVD although only 33 minutes in duration is actually quite informative and gives a real good look how the IDF approaches room clearing ; which would come in handy for those working in the law enforcement/military/ or private security field faced with a room clearing situation (using a two man formation or team)

As this DVD is the third part of a 3 series, I do not recommend buying this series without purchasing the first two. Additionally if you are new to CQB tactics the techniques demonstrated here aren't exactly advanced but nor are they for beginners either; though mind you that there are other alternatives and ways on how to approach room clearing.

I would recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to expand their knowledge on two man urban operations especially those who are keen to see the IDF or Israeli way of room clearing.

Additionally I would have loved to see more or maybe alternatives for the: two man arm bar technique which I found interesting.

All in all i got my money's worth, and should anyone have a chance to train under Garet I would do so; his material is quite solid.",1346112000,,1136,4.63681592039801
