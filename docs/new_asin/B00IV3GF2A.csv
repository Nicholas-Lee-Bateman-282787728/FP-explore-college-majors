Ive watched countless documentaries about environmental sustainability and nutrition, but this is the first one Ive seen that has really hit home with me. After watching it, I cant believe how EASY it is to make such a difference through the simple act of planting fruit trees. Orchard Revolution provides all the information you need to improve the health of your family, whether it be through transforming your yard into an orchard or planting just a few herbs on the window sill in your studio apartment. The best part is that you can make these changes without spending a dime. And youll reap the benefits for years!

Matt Byron does a wonderful job of sharing the touching stories of Americans suffering from diabetes and obesity. Doctors, nutritionists, ecologists, botanists, sustainability experts and home-gardeners weigh in and leave you understanding why we need change, what we need to change, and how to do it.

Even after having seen so many other documentaries I cannot believe how much I learned from this 90 minute film. Absolutely fantastic.

PS. Love the Orchard Guru  learned a ton!! Thank you!!",1395878400,,1150,5.031578947368421

I am so excited to be a part of such a great project that will help the movement to change our culture to improve the health of all of us humans and our earth!  Thanks Matt",1395014400,,337,3.926470588235294
8645611,5,B00IV3GF2A,Matt does a wonderful job documenting many inter-related problems in our country.  He shows how closely what we eat and how we obtain that food are linked to the health of both our bodies and our environment.  The film also makes it clear that anybody can take even the smallest steps to make a difference.  Highly recommend!!!,1395014400,,327,4.701754385964913
8645612,5,B00IV3GF2A,"If you only see one documentary in 2014, make it Orchard Revolution.  If it doesn't inspire you to plant a few trees, watch it again.  A thorough, adept look at the physical, environmental, and social challenges anyone can address with a few minutes in the backyard.",1395014400,,266,4.760869565217392

 Orchard Revolution does an incredible job of telling this story in an unbiased way whilst also presenting a real solution that any member of the human race can begin implementing today.. plant plant plant!

The information is well presented, the thesis well documented and the cinematography entertaining and extremely enjoyable to watch!",1395014400,,421,5.348484848484849
8645614,5,B00IV3GF2A,"The film address peak oil, air pollution, obesity and diabetes. It's profound, in that it recommends fruit trees as part of the solution. I never really gave fruit trees any thought. But now, I'm motivated to grow a couple trees in my yard. This is the best documentaries I've seen in a long time.

8645615,5,B00IV3GF2A,"Orchard Revolution takes a great look at the health impacts, economic impacts, environmental impacts that can been gained with planting trees. I liked that Matt brough permaculture into the conversation about taking positive action and having hope in the face of collapsing and strained systems. Having more of our hands and lands engaged in food production is key and I love that he started with diabetes! We can't compartmentalize these issues anymore. It is all connected. The leverage point is the orchard.",1394928000,,510,5.2317073170731705
8645616,5,B00IV3GF2A,"Awesome movie!!! Obesity and diabetes are huge issues which are overlooked by the mainstream media. Orchard Revolution brings attention to these issues, while promoting the planting of fruit trees as a solution. The movie starts off a little slow, but builds. I loved the final scenes, really cool stuff. After watching the movie I've decided to plant fruit trees in my yard. Overall, I highly recommend it!",1394928000,,407,5.08955223880597
