3004639,5,B000XPSC0C,"Moving, impressive, dynamic, intense; the reasons why many people consider AK as the greatest of all filmmakers is duly presented here in these impressive films.

The picture quality is outstanding and if one doesn't mind taking the time to patiently watch them they will discover that none of these films is a waste of time.  ""No Regrets For Our Youth,"" ""One Wonderful Sunday"" and ""I Live In Fear"" are tremendous with moments that are incredibly moving.  Even ""Scandal"" and ""The Idiot"" contain moments of masterful cinema.

Visibly in evidence here is Kurosawa's bold techniques, his taste for superb composition and the marvelous preformances from the best acting talent in the world.  All in all a set well worth having for those who already familiar with the master's work and those who wish to know more about it.",1356566400,3,818,4.9416058394160585
3004640,5,B000XPSC0C,"I have already reviewed ""No Regrets for Our Youth"" which is one my favorite Kurosawa films. It is certainly the director's most feminist film...with a moving performance from its lead.  But I knew nothing about ""I Live in Fear"" until I read about that movie in a comprehensive book of Japanese film.  Because I bought this Kurosawa collection in order to acquire ""No Regrets for Our Youth"", I decided to watch ""I Live in Fear.""  Not only is it an amazing film but it the most interesting  performance of Toshiro Mifune's entire career - and this was his second film for Kurosawa!  I did not even recognize the actor in his role

The other reviewers have compared the film to King Lear - and yes there is the similar theme of an aging father being humiliated and disrespected by his children.  While the children definitely are selfish, there are other scenes where the father strikes his children or dismisses them out of hand - abuse goes down the generations.

But this film is also about that ""terrible weapon"" - the atomic bomb. Akira Kurosawa was one of a group of Japanese directors who was horrified by the dropping of atomic weapons in his country and was willing to make this a central theme of a movie during the 1950's. The film was made in the shadow of hydrogen bomb tests near the Bikini Atoll, whose radioactive cloud harmed Japanese fisherman.  [In the latter part of his life, he returned to that theme in ""Rhapsody in August.""] The bomb reaches deep into Japanese psychology.  Even ""Godzilla"" is a metaphor for the horror of radioactivity.

Going back to the film, the character which Mifune plays is a shrewd businessman who has always been in control. But somehow he develops an uncontrollable fear that nuclear war is coming and that his family must immediately move to South America to avoid it.  Kurosawa is sensitive to the fact that such a fear would be real in Japan, although the character takes this fear to irrational heights.  The ending is not expected - very powerful.

I consider this Kurosawa's most tragic and depressing film...the ending is heart-wrenching. Toshiro Mifune is magnetic in every scene but in a way very unlike the best known roles of his career.  Here he is a madman...or is he?  The filmmaker  - in all honesty -  poses ""that"" question.

I believe that this film is roundly critical of the West - its harsh jazz, its ""other"" tradition, and (of course) its decision to drop the bomb.  As in ""Drunken Angel"", the director is very careful in his use of music, even street noise, to show urban Japan in a state of transition...possibly losing its way. (A son's open disrepect of his father might have been unthinkable 50 years before.)

Those looking for an unseen masterpiece will find a treasure in ""I Live in Fear.""  I think viewers will also reappraise Toshiro Mifune as one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century. Even though Kurosawa's epic ""Ran"" is a breathtaking color masterwork...as a ""Lear"" figure, Mifune outshines the key performance of Tatsuya Nakadai in the better known Kurosawa film.

""I Live in Fear"" and (of course)  ""No Regrets for Our Youth"" make this collection a must-own.",1329091200,10,3152,4.730769230769231

3004642,5,B000XPSC0C,"The main reason one would own this is to actually see the Criterion version of these five films without purchasing the $300+ Criterion Complete works of Kurosawa:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AK-100-25-Films-of-Akira-Kurosawa-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B002NOZUEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AK 100: 25 Films of Akira Kurosawa (The Criterion Collection)</a>

The best film in this collection is 'No Regrets for Our Youth', but this alone is no reason to spend $60+ on a set of five films.  The other films, though quality, are not quite up to the high bar that Kurosawa sets with No Regrets.  His films from a few years later: Rashomon, Ikiru, and Seven Samurai are among his best and arguably among the best films in history.  This set is essential for true fans, but No Regrets can be rented via Netflix if you merely want to see it and not own it.

This set is great, but I recommend spending the $300 or so and purchasing the entire collection, in the long run this is cheaper for die hard Kurosawa fans.  The other four films are very good and help give one a nice look at Kurosawa's coming of age... still I love this set!

Update:  After tiring of trying to periodically luck out with this at my local library (it gets re-requested instantly and gets long hold lists), I was given this set as a gift.  Watching through the films a second time, and being much more diverse in my classic world cinema outlook, I even more heartily recommend these films.  I am a huge Kurosawa fan.  The Eclipse collection for pre-war Kurosawa is rather interesting academically for those fans of his film career, but are not amazing films in their own right.  It was really No Regrets for Our Youth where Kurosawa was able to come into his own and Stray Dog of course put him on the international scene.

No Regrets for Our Youth stars an impressive Setsuko Hara in a terrific female empowering role.  She was soon to become Ozu's favorite leading lady after Late Spring.

One Wonderful Sunday is rather touching, yet sad.  I did love the use of Schubert's unfinished symphony in the final scene.  A poor, young couple try to enjoy one day together in a Japan struggling to rebuild just after the war.

Scandal was one of my favorites on this collection.  I really enjoyed Takashi Shimura as the crooked lawyer.  A film about two celebrities caught in an innocent photograph that is spun by the tabloids as a secret affair.  They hire a lawyer to fight the tabloids, but he has his own problems and is tempted by corruption.

The Idiot is a fair adaptation of the Dostoevsky novel.  As much as a two hour adaptation of a giant novel can be considered fair.  I kind of count this as a bonus addition to the set.  It is a hard film to find outside of this set.

I live in fear is based on a recurring fear in the 50s of nuclear holocaust. This is a film that has a similar message as Godzilla, just made in dramatically different ways.  Japan was horrified by atomic testing off nearby islands, one incident resulted in Japanese fisherman getting radiation poisoning.  This set off a public outcry against the West, and Japanese directors were quick to feed the frenzy.  A terrific film, oddly by one of the Japanese directors considered to be the most ""Western"" of all.

The restorations are good, but not quite as good as a regular (non-Eclipse series) release.  They are filtered and cleaned up, just not to the level of quality as, say, Ikiru, Drunken Angel, Stray Dog, Late Spring, and other early Japanese films of the 40s and 50s that were released through the regular Criterion label.  An amazing collection.  Worth the set for No Regrets for Our Youth, Scandal, and I Live in Fear.  Five films for a fair price.  Bravo Criterion.",1293926400,7,3770,4.774343122102009

This is personal filmmaking at its best. I like most of his films, but am more into human relations than the samurai warrior stuff. Emotions are what moves me, and these films are great examples of that. If you are a Kurosawa fan, then this is a must. These are some of the most stunning films put to screen.

3004645,4,B000XPSC0C,"""Postwar Kurosawa deserves a lot of praise for making early films by the great Japanes director available at reasonable prices.  I thought the quality of the DVD's was good but then I've thought that about a lot of DVDs of older films that other reviewers have complained about.  The set consists of 5 films.

In my opinion, the two best movies in the set are ""No Regrets for our Youth"" and ""One Wonderful Sunday"".  These are near the quality, overall, of later works of the Master.  ""No Regrets..."" tells of the idealism of young Japanese at the time the War was becoming reality.  One person emerges from all the idealism and bravado as someone who walked the walk and talked the talk.  In viewing this person's metamorphisis from observer to participant we see the early ability of the young director in using film to enhance a statement.  In ""One Wonderful Sunday"" we get to observe young people trying to discover themselves in the midst of the destruction and corruption of Post-War Japan.  Both of these films have a strong impact.

Two movies; ""Scandal"" and ""I Live in Fear"" come across as a bit excessive for the statement that is intended.  This may be due to the times in which the films were made (""I Live in Fear"" tells of a successful businessman who wants to escape the threat of atomic war).  Kurosawa is usually more subtle in his statements which led me to be a bit less impressed with the extremeness of these two films.

The final film, ""The Idiot"" is an adaptation of the Dostoyevsky novel.  It is a bit long but it is still impressive as the story of how innocence eventually gets corrupted by the passions of the world around us.  It come across more as a theater production captures on film.

Until this set came out, I was looking at trying to find rare VHS copies of the same movies.  This set was well worth the price.  Overall, I liked it better than my set of early Hitchcock movies.",1221955200,15,1912,4.524781341107872

The remaining three are all fine dramas with unusual subjects for Kurosawa, and SCANDAL is my favorite of this set. It goes without saying that the video quality is flawless, though without the extensive restoration that some other Kurosawa titles got, so some film artifacts will be noticed. Don't let that scare you, though; if you like Akira Kurosawa, and haven't yet bought this collection, GO DO IT, and hope that Criterion sees fit to release all of his remaining titles ASAP.",1202774400,3,756,4.960629921259843
3004647,4,B000XPSC0C,"All of the reviews thus far have been about No Regrets for Our Youth, which along with Dersu Uzala is probably my most-rewatched Kurosawa movie because of the story lines. As others have mentioned, it makes a political statement about freedom of thought and freedom of expression among university students. It gives Kurosawa a chance to tell the other side of the story only two or three years after The Most Beautiful, which promoted youthful enterprise in furthering Japan's war of ""defense"" against other nations for the glory of the emperor. After the key moment in No Regrets, which was revealed in one of the other reviews, the movie completely changes direction. I am not an Ozu fan and  initially had been annoyed by the goofy girl character in the first half of the movie. However, the second half of the movie brought me up out of my seat -- the sudden need for family loyalty in the face of neighborhood scorn was powerfully presented, and the repeated theme ""No regrets for my life"" really resonates.

Of the other films, I recommend Scandal, which has a real Frank Capra touch to it -- funny since so many of Kurosawa's films transmited their influence back into western cinema. Scandal pits Toshiro Mifune and a local celebrity against the paparazzi of the day, who invent a scandalous story after turning a photo into something more than it really was in order to sell more newspapers. The good guys get a down-on-his-luck lawyer facing a serious moral conflict to represent them in a court case against the tabloid.

Also, The Idiot, which is based on Dostoevsky's novel of the same name, but with a Japanese retelling set among soldiers coming home from the war. It's about a man so stressed by nearly having been executed that he becomes meek as a lamb, and then vies with his much more hormonal friend over how to lead a woman of soiled reputation to her redemption. Although I enjoyed it, it isn't for those people who get tired of foreign movies where people are always struggling with insanity because of some trauma in their lives. There's a lot of insanity in this movie. Unless I'm mistaken, The Idiot has previously been unavailable on DVD.

One Wonderful Sunday and I Live in Fear both bored me. They both had very little plot -- they were essentially just slices of life. Sunday is about a romance, but it's too talky and not very romantic for western sensibilities, although Ozu fans might find it appealing. I Live in Fear is about people worried about nuclear holocaust during the post-World War II years, a theme that had some punch to it but I also found the movie way too talky and sweaty.",1201651200,14,2623,4.670995670995671

8228946,3,B000XPSC0C,"The quality of the video is wonderful.

I only rated it with three stars because the movies are far too depressing for me. I had thought one would be upbeat, but it really depressed me. I was depressed because the portrayal of the humanity of each character seemed so real. I couldn't bear to watch another one. I really prefer movies from the 30's that only had the the depression, high unemployment, crime, and the threat of war in the background.

If you are fortunate enough have the ability to maintain sufficient emotional distance, these are great movies.",1480896000,,562,4.724489795918367

Film = 3-1/2 stars; restoration = 4-1/2 stars.  What to do if you fear imminent nuclear annihilation and have no interest in sharing an underground bomb shelter with your extended family?  This film offers up an alternative ""solution""  which is no longer an option today.  An above average ""modern"" Kurosawa movie with a solid script (Kurosawa is but one of four credited writers which seems to have held in check his tendency to write silliness into scripts) and taught direction (and editing).  Large ensemble of actors provides an across-the-board set of believable characters with which the viewer can easily bond.  Toshiro Mifune delivers an outstanding performance that is so unusual and atypical that viewers might want to double check the opening credits to ensure that Mifune is, indeed, the lead actor!  Dialog is crisp and clearly enunciated by all performers except Mifune who delivers his characteristic mumbling staccato barks.  Intentionally or not, the film depicts dental hygiene as being essentially nonexistent at the time.  Of special interest are Tokyo street scenes circa 1954 shown under the opening credits.  (All the men seem to be in shirtsleeves on the streets, but not in the film.)  Cinematography is fine as are the subtitles (they are most needed when Mifune is speaking).  Music consists of two stunning theremin micro concerts during the opening and closing credits (and a bit beyond).  Restoration is outstanding except for a few wear lines here and there.  The movie comes from the past, but is especially relevant, since the fear remains ever present and continues into the future.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

SCANDAL:  Ingredients Exist For A Fine Film Which The Movie Is Not.

Barely three (3) stars.  The plot and script (the Director is a coauthor) seem to be there; camera and sound also; same for the sets and wardrobe.  But it goes down hill from here.  Acting and direction are pretty good in some scenes and simply terrible (and embarrassing) in other scenes.  The latter out number the former by about three (or more) to one.  A chaotic film both inside the courtroom (which is effective) and on the outside (which is not so much).  One scene has characters celebrating Christmas as New Years in a culture that is not Christian and whose real New Year does not begin on the first day of January!  While this may have been intended to reflect the chaotic state of an occupied Japan, it has very little (if anything) to do with the film's storyline.  The Director milks (as does the film score) many scenes way beyond the dry point (especially the sentimental ones).  Courtroom scenes could have been classic ones (like those of other directors), but, instead, are punctuated with bouts of heavily hammy or totally ludicrous acting (a Kurosawa trade mark) and milking except for the Chief Judge (Masao Shimizu) and the defendant's lawyer (Sugisaku Aoyama).  Subtitles are especially helpful.  Video and audio quality are OK.  Bottom line: Not much of a treat for those outside of the Director's ""fan club.""  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

NO REGRETS FOR OUR YOUTH:  Regrettable and Forgettable

Film = barely two (2) stars; restoration =  one (1) star (but see below).  A mishmash of misguided college-student liberalism amidst the ""tradition"" of military dictatorships that had defined Japan's society for hundreds of years.  Viewed as propaganda, it's easy to see how the film made it through the occupational censors.  (The movie takes place during the first half of the 20th Century.  By then, Japan had been living under military dictatorships [in one form or another] longer than most/all of its colleges/universities had been in existence!)  Lead actress (Setsuko Hara) delivers an over-the-top performance.  The rest of the cast, not so much.  Script is far from original (we seen all this before in one form or another) and proceeds down a well-worn path to a far from surprising result.  This is a sleeper film in the sense that it is sleep inducing.  Restoration (except for apparently the last 10 minutes or so) is close to none existent.  Deteriorated images vary from grey and blurry to dark grey and blurry.  This is likely due to simple economics.  Why spend digital restoration money on such a relatively inferior and minor film?  Cinematography is hard to judge due to the condition of the print.  Film score is fine.  Subtitles are essential given the regional dialect and the amount of slang in the dialog.  May require a liberal dose of industrial- strength kocha to stay awake to the end.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1391299200,,4621,4.986893840104849
8228952,5,B000XPSC0C,"this is a collection of lesser-known and rather rare Kurosawa films mostly unavailable elsewhere, and would be worth the whole price solely for the much overlooked and undervalued political masterpiece No Regrets For Our Youth.  this is one of only 2 films Kurosawa made with a female hero -- here, the luminous Hara Setsuko in one of her very greatest roles. based on a real story of persecution of pacifist civilians during the pacific war, it shows Hara transform her life from suburban piano-playing to politically committed toiling in the fields.  possibly this film has been overlooked because of the strong whiff of --gasp!-- ""communism"" attached to it, but it is a very real depiction of the political idealism present in japan both during and after the war.  a very historically important and emotionally powerful film, with tour de force performances from Hara, Fujita Susumu and Sugimura Haruko.  bravo!",1388707200,2,914,5.114093959731544
