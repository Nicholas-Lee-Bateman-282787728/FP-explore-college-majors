8661822,3,B00KUWPGB6,"Personal Tailor was a fun and goofy comedy. It's about an organization that allows people to live out their fantasies for a few days before they return to their real lives. There were some funny moments that made me laugh. This film never becomes serious so it should not be taken seriously. Not Feng Xiaogang's best work, but I'm glad to have it in my collection. This DVD is Region 3 so be sure your player will play it.",1438387200,,422,4.3544303797468356
