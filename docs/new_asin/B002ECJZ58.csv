3916843,5,B002ECJZ58,"All the helicopter panoramic footages are simply priceless. You can have to be REAL rich to be able to fly over the entire Europe like that! This is an extremely high qaulity set. I first saw it on a KQED fund raising drive, and the price you can get it now is simply a bargain.",1293580800,7,278,4.072727272727272
3916844,5,B002ECJZ58,This is a first rate panoramic view of the most dazzling sights of Europe taken from a vantage point that cannot be seen in your ordinary travels. These DVDs use the finest of photographic visuals to capture the both the oft visited and some rarely seen sights and visits of Europe. If you have seen these episodes over the years on PBS then you know the quality of the videos. This is a top notch production that you will play over and over.,1286928000,12,442,4.337349397590361

3916848,5,B002ECJZ58,"The content, editing and photography of the Visions of Europe series are unbelievable!  What a terrific way to take an ""armchair vacation!""  Just turn off the PC, turn down the lights, and enjoy the sights, along with narration and music.  They are not only informative, but educational - in a thoroughly enjoyable way.  My husband and I will recommend them to everyone we know.  Thank you, Amazon, for making these available.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Visions-of-Europe/dp/B002ECJZ58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Visions of Europe</a>",1268179200,19,576,6.526315789473684
3916849,5,B002ECJZ58,"I own almost all of these WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING PANORAMA FILMS of Europe. Now they come as a set with newly released DVDs included that don't seem (as yet) to be available separately.  ""Visions of Austria"" and ""Visions of the Great Cities of Europe"" are new additions to the formerly available ""Visions of Series.""

All of the DVDs contain the same fantastic helicopter HD filming that has made them the travelogue, documentary, or scenic film footage that everyone else strives for.  The pictures are dynamic, striking, exhilarating, and wonderfully relaxing at the same time.

I have visited all but 2 of the countries available in this set and can honestly say that you get a more complete view of the countries from these DVDs than you do from the ground, even in person.  One can even zoom in using the remote for a closer look, often unnecessary.  The helicopter cameraman zooms aplenty, and pans when that best suits. The footage cannot be given negative notation of any kind.

Each DVD comes with a feature presentation, complete with background music of the country. The music is as good as the camera work. It is always a mix of classical to folk, soothing to danceable, some instrumental, some vocal. All fine.

Each DVDs feature is narrated by someone with the beautiful accent of the country. The historical, and educational information related as you watch the country pass beneath your view is good enough for any classroom, elementary through college.  So the set becomes not just an enjoyable travel documentation but also a fine additional of any European educational experience.  You will see and learn of the ancient to the ultra-modern aspects of each country, and many major cities.  Even some quaint out-of-the-way places.  Sometimes they are the picturesque best.

Each DVD also has extra footage which contains no narration but does have the music background, perfect for waiting room TV play.

This set contains 930 minutes of the most dramatic film footage of Europe that I have ever seen, or ever will see. After seeing ""Visions of Series"" there's no reason to buy any other.

COST EFFECTIVE. Yes, this set, for those who do not own any of the previous released sets, is offered at less than half the price of individual purchases. Buy them this way, because, once you have seen one DVD, you will desire all of them.  They are a perfect, absolute must, set to watch for anyone planning a trip to Europe.  Discover ahead of time what you want to see on foot, and save thousands of dollars in travel time by knowing ahead of time your most-desired destinations.

I wish I could personally thank the helicopter pilots, camera crew, musicians, and narrators for these ""Visions of Series"" and their stunning high definition productions. Yes there is more, like ""Visions of Britain and Ireland"". Scotland. Wales.",1251936000,86,2842,4.910041841004184

3916873,4,B002ECJZ58,"The whole ""Visions of..."" series makes BulRay worth while and this collection is no different; really enjoyable.  I give an easy five stars for content.  However, several of the discs fail to store their shutdown point when stopping. Most DVD's, conventional or BluRay, if you stop in the middle of a program, the player offers you the option of resuming at that point.  Not so with at least two (so far) of these discs.  Each restart goes all the way back to the start up menu, complete with anti-piracy verbiage. Unfortunately, the distributor (Acorn) seems uninterested in responding to questions.  Great if you watch beginning to end in one sitting, but a real pain if not, so mixed feelings.",1374192000,,696,4.815126050420168

3916883,4,B002ECJZ58,"As others have mentioned in much detail, it is beautiful to look at and combined with the music and narration also very relaxing.
Definitely worth getting. However, be aware that seing Europe from the air is like seeing Disneland or Manhatten from the air; you don't get the full effect until you are on the ground.
But that's not the purpose of these discs and not really a criticism. You'll just have to look at a travel show every now and then to complete the experience :-)",1340496000,3,477,4.494252873563219
3916884,1,B002ECJZ58,"Beware buying this Blu-ray if you live in Australia.

3916886,2,B002ECJZ58,"The description said ""Shot in high definition from a helicopter-mounted camera"" - so I bought it for that reason, thinking that it would be gorgeously crisp and detailed in High Definition. But it's not. So on my big TV it's not that clean of a view, buildings and sites are fuzzy... Definitely disappointing after eagerly anticipating this set.

So, buyer beware - ""shot in high definition"" does NOT mean ""presented in high definition"".",1331683200,3,437,4.986301369863014
3916887,4,B002ECJZ58,"Wonderful video, but please be aware that the Bluray version is region coded, so unless you use a computer or a Region Free Bluray player, you will not be able to watch this bluray outside the American continent.

3916888,1,B002ECJZ58,Really looked forward to this set.  Discs came in two formats.  My player can only read the two discs on Italy.  The rest cannot be viewed.  Became a pricey purchase.,1326067200,2,166,4.433333333333334
3916889,4,B002ECJZ58,"Beautiful pictures and at least it is my opinion that seeing things from the air vs. on the ground gives one more perspective. For whatever reason in the Italian series I was unable to view the Visions of Northern Italy part on my DVD. I even returned the whole series and got a new edition and the same thing happened. Every other disc worked except this one in both series, and I can think of no explanation. Just an aside. My only complaint is that I wished that the Visions of Europe covered more countries such as Belgium, Luxembourg, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia, etc. Hopefully, in the future the producers of this series will widen their horizons.",1308960000,6,653,4.637931034482759

8367541,3,B002ECJZ58,"I saw this once on TV and fell in love with it instantly.  It took me a long time to find the physical copy and after watching it again, I admit it wasn't as good as first sight.

The first thing, and to no one's fault but my own, is that a lot of these European cities look almost identical since I have never visited.  I studied abroad in Italy, so many of the towns look familiar and were a delight to see from bird's eye view; but in other cases, it just felt like I was seeing the same five cities over and over again.  One thing I wish they would have done was point out the monuments or location of the town they were flying over.  If they simply told the viewers where the place was, we could start to find associations and make sense of what we are looking at.  Oh well, at least the footage is beautiful.

Commentary is, for the most part, lacking.  Though not always, narrations can be so devoid of substance that it acts as an annoyance more than a supplement.  They will repeatedly point out ""Hey! what a sunny, peaceful day!"", ""enjoy the wine here, it's good!"".  I see that other reviewers have stated that the commentary is sleep inducing and I agree, I can not finish any of the shows without falling asleep once.

Music.  Possibly the worst part of this series.  The selections themselves aren't bad, they are in fact quite authentic to the context that is being used.  What's horrible is that the shows replay the same five tracks for 1-2 hours.  Especially the French one I think.  It plays the same 2-3 songs for the entirety of the show...and trust me, you will notice.  This, combined with the monotonous commentary and cookie-cut towns, I felt like I was stuck in limbo.

Conclusion:
All said and done, I do like the series.  While there are many travel shows, there aren't many that focus just on aerial views, and in such high quality.  I think once I have visited these locations, the episodes will be much more satisfying to watch.",1461283200,,1958,4.386111111111111
