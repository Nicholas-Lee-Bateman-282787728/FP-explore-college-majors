4137658,5,B003L3J5Q8,"This enlightening film presents memorable moments which ought not to be allowed to go down the memory hole. Enjoy the spectacle of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, for once tongue-tied when confronted with the query (by the late Senator Robert Byrd) about what happened to over two trillion dollars that disappeared, unaccounted for, during the Iraq War. Here is a well-documented review of recent U. S. history and policy which pulls away the blinders set in place by the shortcomings of mainstream media accounts.",1305072000,13,517,5.240963855421687
4137659,5,B003L3J5Q8,This video should be viewed by every Congressman and Senator.  What Halliburton has done to our country is criminal.  They should be prosecuted and forced to make restitution to the US government.  And that's just one small item in this incredible video.  Very disturbing but a must see.,1288915200,10,287,4.916666666666667
4137660,5,B003L3J5Q8,Think about the company you work for...  Do they ever tell their employees what they are up to?  Why would corporate media be any different.  Bottom line is the only line for them.,1287792000,18,180,4.393939393939394
4137661,5,B003L3J5Q8,"This is an excellent truthful film which pulls it all together. I've read the PNAC doc and was able to digest and file it away. I've read Northwoods, was appalled, but filed that too away cerebrally. This, however, I won't be getting over any time soon. This is a must watch. -Len Rich, Los Angeles, California",1273449600,27,310,4.553571428571429
8399381,5,B003L3J5Q8,"A devastating look at the sociopathic Neo-con Zionists making American foreign policy during the Bush years. This is an excellent companion/introduction to Mazzucco's longer documentary on 9/11. Some of the most disturbing footage depicts American mercenaries and soldiers in a state of near-sexual excitement as they go on killing sprees against Iraqi civilians, as though they were playing video games.",1457308800,,404,5.75
8399382,5,B003L3J5Q8,Wow. This is the one dvd that should be in ones collection. This dvd will connect all those dots you have wanted to connect.,1455494400,,124,4.208333333333333
8399383,4,B003L3J5Q8,Pretty good documentary showing that Iraq war for oil was planned probably going back to Reagan days and was clear cause for Sept 11 attacks  Should have put more stress on long term Muslim  phobia /hatred and the big mid east prize Iran  Crimea plan  short circuited  Ends kind of abruptly after Iraq but still good,1421884800,,316,4.571428571428571
8399384,5,B003L3J5Q8,This will shock you to no ends. The simple truth that has been hidden from us will make you speechless. This documentary shows the truth and it will make your stomach turn. We really do have some sick twisted fu*ks living among us.,1419638400,,231,4.395348837209302
8399385,5,B003L3J5Q8,"Massimo Mazzucco makes great films.  I have seen a few of his films, and this one is right up there with the others.",1404086400,,116,4.043478260869565
8399386,5,B003L3J5Q8,"This DVD title fills the huge void left by corporo-media, both on TV and in mainstream film.  It provides a comprehensive view of where American empire began, what it is now, and where it might be heading.  There is missing, however, the key fact that ""America"" is at bottom run by foreign banking families some of whom trace their lineage back generations to the ""old world"" where they continue to ply their usurious and intentionally destructive trade.  That is, the late, great USA is the executor of the larger ""old Europe"" (Rumsfeld 2003) grand and patient plan to have ""America"" subjugate the rest of the world militarily only to implode financially domestically, so that the remaining pieces can be gathered and enfolded into the unified globalist order.  Perhaps Mazzucco can address this critical absence in a forthcoming documentary.  Finally, as a matter of caution, like ""Peter Joseph"" of ""Zeitgeist"" fame Mazzucco needs to be vetted by investigative journalists.  His family background in particular would be useful in assessing his larger agenda, hidden or otherwise.  Simple questions like ""who is funding this work"" need to be asked.  (He is from Torino, the historical turf of the infamous Agnelli family and bankers known collectively known as the ""Black Nobility."")  And how did his documentary get broadcast on a Berlusconi TV property (according to Mazzucco himself in an interview KPFK 09.23.09)?  Recall the career of one, Michael Moore, whose early documentaries were adored by the Controlled Left.  More recently, Moore has revealed himself to be nothing more than an Authoritarian but on the Left.  These reservations aside, I will glean what I can from this documentary but will remain cautious not be lulled (and depoliticized) by even seemingly ""progressive"" critiques of New Rome (USA).",1380931200,4,1816,5.202749140893471
8399387,5,B003L3J5Q8,"This is a scary but necessary chronology about 911 and how PNAC has been in the works since the late 50's.  The scariest part for me was how they pinned this on Bin Laden when it is clear, much more sophisticated planning was needed - and money.  America, wake up, your government will kill you for their own motives.  They built secret prisons..look at the military industrial complex since 911.",1361577600,5,396,4.628571428571429
8399388,5,B003L3J5Q8,"The American public are among the most propagandized people on earth. It is time that we start getting our ""information"" from somewhere else than the TV, and stop looking at everything through the ""liberal"", vs ""conservative"" lens. It is a handful of powerful individuals, and multi-national corporate interests that control everything, including the minds of most of the citizens of this country, and the world..",1355184000,16,413,5.369230769230769
8399389,1,B003L3J5Q8,"Stuck it in my computer and nothing:( don't know why, no scratches or anything, just doesn't do anything. Was looking forward to seeing it, saw it mentioned on Instagram. Maybe I got a dud copy?",1352764800,,194,4.571428571428571
8399390,5,B003L3J5Q8,"Do you accept what the newspaper tells you and the 5 o clock news?  If you have ever questioned world events and wonder if you're being told lies or the truth, you need to watch this film.  We must all as individuals seek out the truth beyond the mainstream media.  Are you happy with the state of the country you live in. This is just one of the great films out there to enlighten yourself.  Just a suggestion, watch this with someone you respect and respects you.",1311292800,20,465,4.310344827586207
