8285475,3,B001C0JROC,"When a group of friends in Wales decide to cut school and hang out in the woods, they meet a drifter who will change their lives in the shocking true story, Summer Scars. Writer/Director Julian Richards claims that this actually happened to him as a child. At 67 minutes long, this is one of the shortest films you will ever see and still it felt like it was too long. What happened was unique and defiantly worthy of a film, but it seems to me like Richards decided to tell the entire truth of what happened in painstaking detail. What this film needed was some fiction thrown in to make the story more interesting and to space out the events of what happened. As for the cast, it was almost completely full of newcomers, some of which were horrible, but others like Darren Evans, showed some real skill and a bright future. The only veteran actor was Kevin Howarth, who played the drifter and he was terrific. The veteran horror actor really showed us in a short period of time, what this guy must have really been like and he was really amazing. It's the performances of Howarth and Evans that make this short, creepy film worth watching. Summer Scars was an interesting story, but jumped around so much and had a hard time finding direction. For long periods of time nothing happens, but when it finally does, it comes at you so quickly that you're just confused. I liked this film, but with the story they had to go with, if they had had a better cast, and spread things out a little more, Summer Scars could have been so much more than it was.",1362960000,,1549,4.419580419580419
8285476,4,B001C0JROC,"Yes that is the basic synopsis of this independent Welsh Film. It is directed by Julian Richard and stars his friend Kevin Howarth as Peter an ex soldier who has `life coping' issues and appears to be living rough in the woods.

Our ne'er do well kids are all bunking off school and have agreed to meet up for a wasted day of `hanging' in the aforementioned woods. On the way the only member of the group who is female Leanne steals a scooter. On arrival it is taken for a `joyride' by would be alpha male Paul. He has a disabled brother who he is carrying everywhere and decides to take him for a ride too. On the way they hit Peter and bravely run off.

Peter awakens and tracks them down, he then decides that he quite likes the company and from that moment on he sort of takes control.

This is really not a horror film but more a psychological thriller or study into mental illness. The children all do quite brilliant jobs of acting and come across as surprisingly believable for such a small budget effort. There is no real gore, but despite that the threat of violence or worse is an ever constant presence and that has to be attributable to the performance of Kevin Howarth.

The music is ok with quite a bit of (c)rap music at the beginning. The ending may not be totally satisfying, but this is more about the journey than the destination as all good films should be. It is also not long with a run time just under seventy minutes. All in all a very good effort, but it is still just 4 stars and is one of those films where nothing more will be garnered from subsequent viewings, but worth giving a go once any way if only for supporting indie Welsh cinema.",1333411200,,1668,4.285714285714286
8285477,1,B001C0JROC,"after browsing pages and pages of suggestions i found this movie, and from what i read from peoples reviews i figured id purchase it and give it a shot. but after watching about 10 minuets i was very disappointed.. i turned it off and walked away. i don know if it was the fact that i was expecting something more or what, but it fell short.. i decided to watch the whole thing in its entirety and not try to jump to any conclusions but in the end i was left with the same sentiments.. don't get me wrong the cinematography wasn't too bad and the actors were decent..but alas, it just DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME.. definitely NOT worth 10 bucks let alone 2 dollars",1280620800,,662,4.261904761904762
8285478,5,B001C0JROC,"This was by far one of  the best movie I have seen this year. It had action, drama and anything else you may look for in a movie. I would tell anyone to buy this movie. It is about a group of kids who go into the woods only to find a man who is crazy off the wall. He is a control freak who wants to make the teens do things his way and only his way. The group is made up of all boys and one girl and towards the end it is a little creepy at what he made them do. I gave it a five star rating and would buy it again. I don't want to give anything away about the substance of the movie but I don't think you would be disappointed in purchasing it for you dvd collection.",1268438400,,669,3.6458333333333335
8285479,3,B001C0JROC,"I didn't have any expectations regarding this film. Plot is basically about a group of kids with bad attitudes who encounter an old creepy guy in the woods. There's plenty to work with but I think this movie fell short because of what didn't happen plot-wise. I still managed to enjoy it though,",1267920000,,295,4.584905660377358
8285480,5,B001C0JROC,"Anyone who recalls misspent summers of youth will understand well how a single day can echo down the years. Like the similarly resonant stories of Rob Reiner's STAND BY ME, or MEAN CREEK, SUMMER SCARS captures fragile youth at a turning point, with cracks opening up to the darker adult world.

Six friends bunk off school to spend the day in the woods. Armed with a few cans of beer and some very inadequate barbecue skills, they're free to do just what 14-year-olds do best: show off, swear, fight and spend the day just hanging out together. The first reel of Julian Richards thriller is spent solely in the company of these six. Like most real kids they're certainly no angels, and might qualify as 'hoodies' in a cruder film.

Riding a stolen moped around the bumpy woodland paths, two of the gang collide with a lone adult, Peter (Kevin Howarth). They fear the worst, and leg it from the scene, but Peter is unharmed and soon emerges to join the group. Attention turns to this unknown quantity, and the focus of the group shifts. Peter seems to be 'down with the kids'. He's sympathetic, and is soon leading the gang into new scrapes.

But Peter can't be pinned down - one minute he's offering life lessons to his young charges, the next he seems more sinister, playing divide and conquer, and easily exploiting tensions by turning friends against one another. As the afternoon wears on, events take worrying turns, and it appears Peter's agenda may be closing in on the gang.

This indie thriller (from the director of THE LAST HORROR MOVIE) makes all the right moves with an engagingly 'real' cast of youngsters. Never patronising and edgy throughout, it's a heartfelt picture of fragile adolescent faiths.",1215648000,25,1714,4.741610738255034
