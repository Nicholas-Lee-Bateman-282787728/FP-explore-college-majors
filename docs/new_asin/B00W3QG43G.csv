7119480,5,B00W3QG43G,"I love this season. I think it's the best of the series; it all leads to a satisfying finale, and Master Chen is both plenty evil and plenty funny! Season 5 has already aired in it's entirety, and I thought that season was good as well, it just seemed like a small step down from this one. All in all, highly recommended to anyone and everyone!",1437523200,6,344,4.2272727272727275
