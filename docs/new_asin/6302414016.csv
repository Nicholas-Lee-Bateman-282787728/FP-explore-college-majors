458636,5,6302414016,"Funny, frightening, informative, sad and triumphant, it fully captures the madness of creating one of the great epic films of the last 50 years.
It also offers insight into how much of art is accidental or discovered instead of planned.

If you are interested in film, the artistic process, Francis Coppola or anything else about 'Apocalypse Now' this is a must see.

Indeed, it's pretty much a must see for anyone.

While you can buy it separately, it also comes as part of the great Apocalypse Now 'Full Disclosure' 3 disc blu-ray set.",1445990400,,537,4.752688172043011
458637,5,6302414016,"Subtitled, ""A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"", this 1991 film is a documentary about the making of ""Apocalypse Now"", the 1979 film based on Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"". Set in Vietnam, it is the story of a captain, Martin Sheen, and his crew's mission to find and kill an insane colonel, Marlon Brando, who had created his own kingdom deep in the Jungle. On the way, everyone is touched with the evil around them. This summer I saw the re-edited version of the film and have been intrigued by it ever since. When I heard about this ""Hearts of Darkness"" I just HAD to see it.
The filming of Apocalypse Now was supposed to take just sixteen weeks at a budget of $13 million. It wound up costing more than $30 million, much of it put up by Francis Coppola himself, and took almost three years to get to the public. Coppola' wife Eleanor and their three children went along on location in the Philippines. She was interested in making a documentary and shot a lot of behind-the-scenes footage, even secretly recording private conversations she had with her husband about the film. The authenticity of the experience really comes through, as everyone involved with the production seemed to go a little bit insane.
Coppola had serious doubts throughout and we hear his words of despair as he thinks he's making a bad movie. We see the terrible typhoon that destroyed all the sets and realized that the helicopters that were being used for the shooting were actually property of the Philippine government who kept calling them away to fight a real disturbance that was going on just ten miles away. We see shots and scenes that never made it into the original film (although much of it eventually made it into the 2001 ""Redux"" version). We see and overweight Marlon Brando who insisted on being filmed in shadows. And we are right there to watch the filming of the scene in which Martin Sheehan has a mental breakdown. In order to do this he became bleary-eyed drunk, cut his thumb on a mirror and used the blood as part of the scene. The intensity is chilling and when, a short time afterward, he has a life-threatening heart attack at the age of 36, we're all there to see him as he is given first aid.
Now, years later, some of the actors are interviewed about their experiences. We learn that they did a lot of drugs during many of the scenes - acid, speed, marijuana, alcohol, which certainly added to the authenticity as well as the craziness of the whole production. Robert Duval talks about how his famous line ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning was improvised. And the whole cast talks about how they improvised a massacre scene. Laurence Fishburne was only 14 when the film was made, a real coming-of-age experience for him. But this very stirring film portrait belongs to Francis Coppola. We get to meet him as a very imperfect human being doing his best to create an art form out of the script, changing it constantly as he went along, and eventually turning out a small masterpiece which went on to be nominated for eight academy awards.
I give this video my highest recommendation. It is a ""must"" for movie buffs. And an essential education for anyone involved in filmmaking itself. Don't miss it!",1010016000,97,3212,4.636842105263158
458638,5,6302414016,"It's truly a shame that this amazing documentary is now out of print.  Hunt down a used copy or find it at your local video rental place.  It's well worth the effort.
The amazing thing about the Coppola's efforts is the circular karma that seemed to go into overdrive: Francis tries to make a film based on ""Heart of Darkness"", a story about a man and a country that gets lost in his mental interior while probing the interior of an alien land.  He uses the story to try and tell the story of a different man and a different country getting lost in their mental interiors while probing the interior of another alien land.  In the process Coppola, trying to deal with his lead actor getting lost in his mental interior while probing the interior of an alien land, loses himself in his mental interior while probing...well, you get the picture.",991267200,7,842,4.519736842105263
458639,5,6302414016,"The consistant 5 star ratings say it all. The only new perspective I felt compelled to add is that ""Hearts of Darkness"" is inextricably a part of a complete ""Apocalypse Now"" experience every bit as much as the ""Boot camp"" section of Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" can not be viewed separately from the Nam sequence of that film. This is to say that it is my sincerest hope that the reason the studio has pulled the VHS version,and has since ""failed"" to release this masterpiece of documentary on the making of a masterpiece of cinema is because they realize the ""only"" proper thing to do is release ""Hearts of Darkness"" with ""Apocalypse Now"" in a single DVD commemorative boxed set. They have to be viewed as if one film and that's the only excuse I'll ever take for them pulling the VHS and not releasing the DVD. I'm refusing to buy the DVD of ""Apocalypse Now"" until they get it right! Till then I can view the ""Apocalypse Now"" DVD at any number of friends' gatherings while occasionally popping in the VHS version of ""Hearts of Darkness"" to hold us over. It's their market loss.",981504000,3,1080,4.543589743589743
458640,5,6302414016,"Shot by Francis Ford Coppolla's wife, Hearts of Darkness is an incredible, one hour fifty minute documentary that reveals the horrors of making the very popular Apocalypse Now.  The film took forever to make, driving many  of its participants to the brink of insanity, not just Coppolla, who was  emotionally-unstable for much of the film.  Viewers of this fascinating  documentary will be amazed to learn that Harvey Keitel was originally cast  as Willard, but was dropped after only two weeks of shooting.  Though only  36 years-old, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack during filming, an event  that further postponed its debuts in theaters.  There is some really great  footage included here, especially the shooting of the opening sequence of  the film which involves a very drunk Sheen lashing out as both his  character and himself (at that point, Sheen was experiencing a lot of  hostility towards Coppolla and had it out with him right then and there, an  episode that would appear in the finished movie).  Even if you didn't  particularly care for Apocalypse Now, you will most likely find Hearts of  Darkness interesting, nonetheless.  It is a magnificent look at the  troubles and triumphs of a film crew headed by a somewhat mad, but  brilliant director.  This shouldn't be missed.",959904000,27,1295,5.037914691943128

458866,5,6302414016,"Seeing this on the big screen when released in 1991 had a profound effect on my notions of filmmaking. I was only just out of my teens, but looking back it was probably the event that completed my transition from avid film goer to crazed film buff. This review is brief because it's based on my memories of 25 years ago...

Should you watch it? Apocalypse Now was a perfect storm, the rare occurrence of synergistic acting with exactly the right picks by a director who was hell-bent on making a motion picture that will be remembered a century later: Do you not want to learn all the lurid details of how it was brought to life? If you've followed the career of an actor from Apocalypse Now or simply want more Apocalypse, this should hold your attention. Hearts of Darkness provides a more intense glimpse of the famous scene that precipitated Martin Sheen's heart attack; it's actually more dramatic viewing when you know it wasn't ""acting"" in the traditional sense (I still remember an overwhelming sense of anxiety while watching it, hungover as I was at the cinema's matine). I daresay the enigma of Marlon ""I swallowed a bug"" Brando's rock star presence is alone worth the price of admission.",1464998400,,1199,4.682464454976303
