8590703,5,B00D90OT1O,"After two months having purchased this DVD, I manged to finally sit down and view it in its entirety. I was sorely tempted to write a negative review about this documentary, for I had dozed off to sleep while watching it, twice!....and I attributed it to the program and not to my fatigue. Lesson learnt? This is a serious documentary that requires the viewer's full attention.

So who was Fr. Placido Cortese? A Franciscan priest, small of stature whom one might possibly pass on a street, merely paying attention to his limping gait and then dismissing him from one's mind. But a book is not to be judged by its cover. This man was exceptionally brave, and in a time of darkness and oppression he brought light and freedom to many.
Born Nicolo Cortese on the island of Cres in the Austro-Hungarian empire to a middle class family, Nicolo found his vocation at an early age with the Conventual Franciscans. After having been ordained a priest,and taking the name 'Placido' in religion,he was transferred to the Shrine Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua and  20 years later an encounter with Slovenian medical students would thrust him into the underground resistance movement to help those unjustly incarcerated by the Nazis by transporting things on his person to help the detainees in prisons and organizing an underground relief group to help Allied soldiers escape.
In the course of this show we meet remarkable men and women who would risk all in the name of Christian charity to help those less fortunate and oppressed.

The adventures that these men and women face, with this intrepid priest as retold by them, are exciting as well as inspiring. Likewise their accounts of Fr. Cortese testify to the heroic sanctity of this man. Also his confreres too, recall his character and personality.

The last part of his documentary retells the sadistic torture that Fr. Placido went through at the hands of the Gestapo to force him to reveal his associates in his 'criminal activities'. This is again recounted by eyewitnesses who saw him in the underground bunker at the Piazza Oberdan in Trieste and also by British records of what was done to him and his eventual fate. The accounts are really graphic and when this is coupled with pictures of the said underground bunkers, the effect is that much more. The events of interrogation under torture are told to us by Father's fellow inmates who were tortured with him. And Father's words of encouragement and admonishment? Pray......and be silent!

""The Christian religion is a weight we must never tire of carrying....""so said Fr. Placido.  And right he was....especially in a time when our freedoms are being compromised the world over. Also ' the liquidation of undesirables' a policy taken by the Nazi's is a policy that most countries have long adopted through Abortion and Euthanasia.....especially literally, today when in Belgium a child's right to die was passed successfully in the parliament by a landslide vote. How long will that take to reach our shores in the name of progress and modernity? The effects of Hitler's and the USSR's policies have long been upon us........how much further will we go. The Christian religion is a weight we must never tire of carrying indeed. Now more than ever live Fr. Placido Cortese we must be lights in the darkness that engulf the worlds and bastions of moral courage.

This documentary is 64 minutes long in English.

I sincerely do not recommend this documentary to anyone below 15 years of age due to the graphic description of the torture that the many interviewees describe on this DVD.

Venerable Placido Cortese, bright star of courage and martyr of Christian charity. Pray for us!",1392249600,3,3690,4.9006410256410255
8590704,3,B00D90OT1O,"This story of Fr. Placido during the Nazi reign in terror.  This movie was a telling of what happened to this priest during WWII.  It is told by the accounts of those who knew him.  It is a bit hard to watch--not the images but the thoughts and memoirs of those who knew him and encountered him in the torture cell.  It leaves a mark on your soul.  For me, it left me sad but like Christ, Fr. Placido was winner here.  He did not give one single name to the torturers of his body.  The accounts of this priest tell us a story of the
suffering of the body and mind but not the triumph of those who tortured this poor little priest.

This movie is not for the faint of heart.  I is a story that reminds us of the Nazi's and their mindless/darkness in the days of Hitler.  This period of time in History is hard to look at.  Still, Fr. Placido's story must forever be a reminder of a time in History when humanity allowed the Devil to reign.  It was in the time of Christian USA when the power's of Darkness could be quelled.  Isn't it time in the USA that America should remember when Christian principals destroyed the Devil's power?  Are we ripe today, to return, to blind followers of Satanic principals?

The movie was worth the price, but it is not a movie to pop in the drive for entertainment.",1391817600,,1298,4.198380566801619
