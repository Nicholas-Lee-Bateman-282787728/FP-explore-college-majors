8006265,5,B00014K5NC,"Oh joy!  This is teen-shoujo(anime aimed at girls) at its very best! If you're a girl you'll love it!  if you're not a girl... you'll love it!)

I promise your heart will race! You'll titter like an eleven year old--- you'll fall onto your bed wondering--- how does Sukasa really feel...When does anyone go to class at this school?  Comparisons:  Silly like Cardcaptors but much more mature themes-- this series comes to the US as NR but it's definitely not for anyone under 16 (without plenty of parental surpervision).

The theme song is so danceable and memorable--- totally uplifting; it gives me shivers like the Evangelion theme (1st and mid episodes, not the changeover music).

The main charater Tsukushi is such a strong girl-- I mean woman-- no I mean grrl--- if you can have one of those in an anime where no one gets shot...  Humm, I wonder..?

Tips, tips, tips--- don't read too many reviews--- Spoilers, spoilers!)  Watch out-- it's fun to be surprised, though this series is totally watchable over and over--- like Gundam.  Make sure to see them in order  -- otherwise the depths, and in some cases shallowness-.- of the relationships b/t the characters is easily misunderstood.

If you want good teen-shoujo -- though this is really for anyone who likes high school antics and ethics.

Test: If you've never seen anime, but you liked Heathers-- all that ""suicide"":) aside--- you'll love this all the fun without the death---- and much worse(great!) 80's type high-fashion!)

Yes, watch every epsiode you can get your hands on:).",1107907200,2,1544,4.884615384615385
