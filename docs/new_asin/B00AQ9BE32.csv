8556274,5,B00AQ9BE32,"I love this video.  It's almost like  being there!  The sights are incredible and the recording is flawless, I use my fitbit and walk 10,000 steps, and time flies!  I will order other videos by VITA, and will recommend it to friends.  I am glad I can order it through Amazon, and at a good price.",1446768000,,296,4.214285714285714
8556275,5,B00AQ9BE32,"I felt I was there! The beautiful scenery made this exercise session fly by. You can set your own pace and incline, so if you want a casual stroll or an intense workout (or anything in between), you can do it. This DVD is the next best thing to being there. There is also a short bonus chapter which allows for a scenic cool down.",1402531200,,330,4.092307692307692
