The cast did the best they could with a script that goes no where but it is still crap. Half way through the movie you will be sitting there wondering two things.

1. what the hell is going on

2. Do I care what is going on and when is this going to end.

Here's a helpful hint, watch the first fifteen minutes, then fast forward to finishing twenty minutes and you will have all the information required to know what took place.",1143763200,,600,3.9421487603305785

2486673,2,B000E3L7EG,"Ring Around the Rosie (Rubi Zack, 2006)

Here's a movie that really looks like it's going somewhere, then it cops out. It's not as disappointing as Les Revenants, because it never gets anywhere near that good, but it does look like it has at least a little potential-- a decent cast, some great scenery, character interaction that really does have a creepy feel to it, and then all the sudden, bam. You're stuck in the hell that is the Hollywood clich&eacute;.

The story: Karen Baldwin (Jeepers Creepers' Gina Philips) inherits her grandparents' summer home, with express deathbed instructions from her grandmother to clean it up and sell it. She and her boyfriend Jeff (Randall Batinkoff, Dead Man's Curve) drive out to do the job, then they realize that it's going to take a lot more time than they thought. Jeff heads back to his job in the city, leaving Karen to do the job, assisted by Pierce (Paparazzi's Tom Sizemore), the caretaker. Karen is surprised by the arrival of her sister Wendy (D.E.B.S.' Jenny Mollen), and before long, the two of them are spending a lot more time reminiscing than actually getting anything done. Karen, however, is quite unhappy with the attention Pierce is paying Wendy, and Wendy's flirtatious attitude towards it.

The biggest problem with the movie is that you can see the ending coming no more than five minutes in. The second-biggest is that the script-- which it seems to have taken four people to write, according to IMDB-- never even attempts to give you any red herrings or the like; it's a mystery/thriller where there's no mystery and very few thrills. I wouldn't call it (as some IMDB pundits have) the worst movie ever-- I'd rather sit through this for a week straight, on infinite repeat, than every have to watch five minutes of Dances with Wolves ever again-- but there's absolutely nothing about it to recommend. The acting is competent, but rarely rises above that (and when it does, it's usually Tom Sizemore's fault); the same can be said of the direction, without anything after the ""but"". The pacing is awful, the cinematography pedestrian. Even the sound doesn't stand out. It's a perfectly bland film. But at least it achieved perfection in one respect. **",1216339200,,2218,4.846965699208443
2486674,1,B000E3L7EG,"I really liked Gina Philips in JEEPERS CREEPERS, and I love horror films, so I was looking forward to RING AROUND THE ROSIE -- but this film is no JEEPERS CREEPERS.

Instead, in terms of both film genre and quality, RING AROUND THE ROSIE is a lot like the abysmally opaque, boring, and confused SILENCE BECOMES YOU.

RING AROUND THE ROSIE is no horror film.  I suppose it's meant to be a ""suspense"" film, but there's no suspense here.  Instead, Gina Philips spends much time wandering about an old house that she'd inherited, ""seeing things.""  Flashbacks, or fantasies, or dreams, or ghosts, or maybe she's going insane, or ... well, she'd spent summers in the house as a child, so there are lots of ""memories.""

I guess we're supposed to be impressed with all these possibilities and filled with suspense as we wonder, gee, who knows what's going on?  But I wasn't filled with suspense.  I was bored.

There's also an ""erotic subtext.""  An ominous caretaker who has the hots for Philips.  When the caretaker makes his move on Philip's sister, there's even some cliched cross-cutting with scenes of unruly horses.  Ooooooo! -- what fierce passions lie just beneath these characters' cool exteriors!

Boooring!

Okay, here's a spoiler warning (although not really, because I saw it coming)...

In the end we discover that ... it was all a dream!

You want more proof this film is bad?  It's an hour and 23 minutes (not including credits) -- but there are FIVE credited screenwriters.  No wonder the script is so confused.  Flashbacks, fantasies, dreams, ghosts ... it's real, it's not real ... these writers were all writing a different script.

Poor Gina Philips.  She wanders about this film, looking confused most of the time.  No wonder.  Not only is her character confused, but this poor actress was still trying to figure out what this script was about as she was filming it.",1199145600,,1880,4.788161993769471
2486675,1,B000E3L7EG,"RING AROUND THE ROSIES is a pocket full of poop.  Apparently someone thought it was a good idea to remake 1950's schlock flick ""The Screaming Skull"" without the skull, but with all the screaming.  And Gina Philips screams a lot, often for no particular discernible reason, leaving us to try to figure out if SHE'S what we're supposed to be frightened of.  I was scared of her.  I pity her character's husband, who splits early in the film, leaving her looked after by the gardener, who is played by a life-sized but not quite life-like Tom Sizemore marionette.

Characters say very flat, obvious things to each other, and are always met with ""Really?"" as a response.  Count the number of times this happens.  It will bother you. It may be the shabbiest script ever written.

Also, Gina Philips is a special brand of over actor.  You won't believe the bizarre physical choices she makes in bringing her character to life.  For example, she's walking down the stairs with a stack of papers and books, only to find her friend at the bottom of the stairs to greet her.  She literally drops 35 lbs of books and debris all over herself in surprise!  But it's no big deal.  The scene just carries on.

Anyhow, long story short, Gina Philips has nightmares all the time, though I'm not sure why, and Tom Sizemore may or may not be a bad guy.  All of this happens on a ranch with horses, and it doesn't end soon enough.  If you like lots of quick cut editing of nothing during which a woman screams, see this movie by all means.",1189382400,,1519,4.469090909090909
2486676,4,B000E3L7EG,"I originally wrote that this movie was ""disappointing to say the least.""  However I have rewatched it and read some interpretations and I was wrong.  Like Mulholland Drive it's fascinating and if you pay attention and think, it does all click together and is very satisfying.  It now haunts me.  For the moderately intelligent thoughtful and patient this is a good choice.  It's missing a star because it really could have been a little bit more fleshed out-although I'm not sure even that's a real problem for the film.",1183334400,4,520,4.797752808988764
2486677,1,B000E3L7EG,My partner and I started to watch this movie and after 30 minutes into the movie we shut it off. I could not find a story or anything worth my time to keep watching it. I am not going to say that this was a B movie because it isn't. It is worse than that and I really like B movies. Move on to your next movie if you are looking into this one.,1172361600,,343,3.6486486486486487
2486678,2,B000E3L7EG,I bought the movie and wish I had left it on the shelf. It's not very entertaining at all.,1171411200,2,90,3.789473684210526
2486679,1,B000E3L7EG,"""Ring Around the Rosie"" stars Gina Philips (""Jeepers Creepers"") and Tom Sizemore (""Saving Private Ryan""). I was interested in their names, but sadly the film is terribly boring, even though it runs less than 90 minutes.

Gina Philips plays Karen, a young business woman who inherits a house in a remote place in the countryside, which might or might not be haunted. Near the house lives a caretaker played by Tom Sizemore, who might or might not be possessed by something evil. The premise is all too familiar, used recently in such films as ""The Amityville Horror,"" and with the right direction the film would be thrilling.

But you will soon realize that there in no thrills of any kind, not even a surprise by sudden big sound, in ""Ring Around the Rosie"" which introduces many recycled bits of images seen in other thrillers - from rudimentary tricks like shadows moving behind the door, a weird reflection in the mirror, strange noise in the midnight or unreliable neighbor staring at the protagonist, to the heroine tormented by nightmares and her buried memories of the past.

The film has also Karen's amiable boyfriend (Randall Batinkoff) and her lovely younger sister (Jenny Mollen). The former leaves the house while Karen stays to clean up the house; the latter arrives there and what Karen sees and hears start to get stranger. Considering the nature of the conclusion and suggested history of Karen's childhood (which I cannot disclose here), there could be some psychological explanations about the strange events that terrorize Karen, as in such thrillers as `The Others."" That's what I thought while trying not to sleep, but no matter how I try, I cannot find one in this disjointed story that is confusing and illogical. If you see a character falling from the window and another character catches her in his arms in a cartoon-like way, you realize this is not a very good psychological thriller.

Or maybe I am thinking too much. Probably this is another badly written horror film you might find in your rental video shop, borrow it and regret it later. Whatever it is, I was bored, and that I can say pretty confidently.",1170806400,5,2139,4.836065573770492
2486680,5,B000E3L7EG,"Ring Around the Rosie was/is a far better film then the reviewers here say it is. This is a creepy little film more in the vain of lets scare jessica to death. Unlike jessica though, this one has coped a real and underserved baging. For no other reason then the fact, it refusess to spoon feed the veiwer, which has now become the norm with the teeny horror market, which this doese not belong too. I found this film to be a throw back to the older style horror thriller, when people did not mind using their brains to follow a film. the reviewer who said if this was made ten years ago, it would have been cheered, rather then jeered, is spot on. Anyway if your the sort of person who likes moody,creepy films with more adult story lines, and don't mind having to use a brain cell or two, give this a go. more like it need to be made, or teeny horror will take over, and thats truelly scarry",1165017600,13,892,4.191860465116279
2486681,1,B000E3L7EG,"Let me just start by saying that I am very open to different styles of films and different approaches. I am also a very big fan of the genres of horror or suspence. Having said that, this film basically took the approach of shooting several incoherent scenes(since when is it terrifying to just shake the camera around and use lame camecorder type effects to create terror)of it's protagonist walking around or laying in bed. Trust me when I say that those who liked this film must have been drunk, and basically chalked up the shotty story to their inebriation(sorry folks no one understands this film, even sober)or simply trying to rectify to themselves their having wasted money and time on this movie.

I won't go into what it's about too much as you can read the other reviews on that. Let me say that this film fails in all of the following areas.

Suspense-there isn't much suspense over the initial 45 minutes of the protagonist simply acting weird, thinking weird things, or dreaming of weird things. So what?

Story-Did these guys write this story in seperate parts, throw them together and kill their editor? This had to be the most inchorent pile of garbage every considered a story to be on a movie screen, or tv screen for that matter. I actually looked at my watch several times and thought, ""they don't have much time left to get to some point or go somewhere with this film.""

Acting-it was overdone and humurous(when it wasn't supposed to be).

Direction-convinced there was no director.

basically over and over during the film, my wife and I kept saying, ""this is really stupid."" I think we finished the film as a badge of honor of sorts. We made it into a funny psuedo myster science theater-look at this pile of garbage type event.

I've only seen maybe one or two other films in MY LIFE that were this bad.

I plead with the director, just because you got a camcorder for christmas doesn't make you a movie maker. Not a legit one.

To wrap this up, the ending of the film was such a freaking predictable letdown, that I laughed out loud, then thought back to all of the ridiculous scenes that had nothing to do with it.

Actually this film did make me laugh. So it got a star for that.

Should've known better though. Any film which has it's packaging try to explain itself so much on the back of the box probably has it's reasons for doing so...BECAUSE THE FILM WILL MAKE NO SENSE OTHERWISE.",1163116800,3,2416,4.543778801843318
2486692,1,B000E3L7EG,"I'm an avid Horror movie goer. My taste in horror flicks may not be the best, I'll admit I am a little picky, but they still have to be worth watching. This movie has no redeeming qualities to it whatsoever. I watched it with a group of people and by the first five minutes none of us knew what was going on, yet the ending was easily predictable. It was one of the worst horror flicks I've ever seen. I wouldn't recommend even renting it.",1161561600,4,439,4.176470588235294
2486693,1,B000E3L7EG,Notice how ever single positive review was made on either April 5th or April 11th?  And notice how this movie is the only one each of them have ever reviewed on amazon?  Is that not vaguely suspicious?  I guess the only way to sell a crappy movie is by posting fake reviews.,1155600000,8,274,4.230769230769231
2486694,4,B000E3L7EG,"An hour into Ring Around the Rosie, I was wondering why in the name of H.P. Lovecraft so many reviewers trashed this movie.  It was genuinely creepy, suspenseful, disturbing in an I-haven't-figured-it-out-yet-but-I-have-some-ideas kind of way, and building up to something quite possibly momentous.  Very soon thereafter, though, the story suddenly became way too disjointed and tumbled into several what-the-heck-just-happened moments.  That most definitely is a problem, and I can see how some viewers would begin to turn on the film at that point.  I can also see how the ending leaves some viewers feeling as if the movie just gave them the finger.  Still, speaking as a horror veteran who has seen it all (or at least most of it), I think Ring Around the Rosie rises to the occasion much more often than it falls into clich&eacute;s.  If this would have been released ten years ago, it would certainly have generated more cheers than jeers.

We horror fans are incredibly fortunate to have Gina Philips working in our genre; I would watch this gorgeous woman in anything at all, and I'm so thankful I don't have to suffer through sugary romances or chick flicks to bathe in her beauty.  I think she's even sexier when she's scared - and her character, Karin, is scared quite a lot during Ring Around the Rosie.  The fact that she already suffers from strange nightmares does not bode well when Karin inherits the country house where she and her sister used to spend their summers.  She and her boyfriend head out there to begin packing things up and getting the house ready to sell.  It's soon obvious that something just isn't right around there, with a lot of the mystery seemingly associated with a mysterious closet door.  Despite some unsettling experiences in the house, though, her boyfriend leaves here there - out in the middle of the country with no transportation - for several days.  That's when she meets Pierce (Tom Sizemore), a strange fellow who has been looking after the place.  Pierce looks a little bit French to me, so I didn't trust him from the start.  Things soon progress from weird noises and nightmares to unexplainable occurrences and real danger - a trend which continues after Karen's sister Wendy (Jenny Mollen) shows up a few days later.

It wouldn't be appropriate for me to describe the kind of things that happen as this film moves along its singularly unique track.  I can say that the story takes on an atmosphere of increasing creepiness and suspense, though.  I actually think the ending is pretty effective, and some viewers won't really see it coming - heck, even I was surprised by certain elements of it.  The only problem I have with the film is the way it rushes through a few scenes without really tying them together - it feels like the director forgot to actually remove some deleted scenes.  In a way, though, this disjointed sense of the later action works in concert with the story's idiosyncratic nature.

Obviously, I can't guarantee you will enjoy this film as much as I did.  If you think every film is supposed to explain every single plot element to you at the end, chances are you won't regard this film too highly.  This isn't an episode of Scooby Doo.  Personally, I like and appreciate the odd horror film that doesn't spell every plot element out for me in the end.  One's own imagination is a much more effective story-teller than any Hollywood scriptwriter, so what's wrong with a film leaving a few things open to your own interpretation?  This film does make sense, but it doesn't cater to your every whim or leave time for questions and answers during the end credits.  To some viewers, that's a bad thing, but I find it rather refreshing.",1155340800,5,3711,4.7578125
2486695,2,B000E3L7EG,"Ring Around The Rosie is just not that good.  I really don't know if it was the script or the director, so I'll just blame both of them.

I've never heard of Rubi Zack.  Not even sure if that's a man or a woman's name.  I see no other films that Zack has directed that I have heard of.  I bet there is a reason for that.

Alex Barder, I am not trying to be mean, but maybe you should find another craft.  Writing a movie where the same thing happens over and over and over is jut not good writing.

Ditto to the other writer of this film:  Jim Suthers

Okay, now a bright spot about this movie.  Gina Philips is beautiful, a good actress, and cannot be blamed for the poor quality of the script or direction of this production.  She works hard to make her character believable; a woman who faces a less than pleasant past with a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety.  Her character is always experiencing flashbacks and haunt-backs throughout the film.

Randall Batinkoff turns in the worst performance of his career.  His character, the main character's boyfriend, is not even remotely interesting or convincing.

Jenny Mollen is not so bad in this film.

Tom who?  Rent Lock Up, Sizemore is really good in that!  Just kidding, please don't kill me, Tom.

Ring Around the Rosie reminds me of why I think I have a shot as a writer.  If this script was made into a movie, anything is possible.  However, I guess it is quite possible that the director made this the tragedy it became.

She has a livein boyfriend, of course and her younger sister shows up, as does a mysterious handyman who plays some part in the mystery.  The real mystery is why movies like these continue to get made.  No payoff and what has happened by the end is never explained to its audience.

The majority of the movie felt like pieced-together bits with a cheap, extremly disappointing ending.  I was hoping the caretaker had some mental powers, like astral projection, which some of the bits would have supported, but no such luck.  I have no love for movies that end up being all someone's psychosis, but I can tolerate them if the psycho trip is at least interesting.  Her's was not... except for a few tiny bits.

It does many things right for a movie in this category (supernatural horror/ thriller). The sound effects are used at appropriate places and to their full potential, the images are photographed from interesting angles and with attention to details. The story is a little bit predictable at times,  nothing original. The acting is decent but not extra-ordinary. At places this reduces to psycho killer type thriller, but atleast it doesn't give away everything in the beginning, leaving us bored for the rest of the movie.

I am giving it three stars because it is definitely better than all those classical B-grade horror movies out there, where  group of people with ""strong attitudes"" get trapped. Then the ""heroes"" among them try to shoot the zombie/alien with a machine gun. Eventually, they all get chewed up one by one. None of that crap in this movie. So it does deserve 3 stars.

Others in the genre are Blacktop, starring Meatloaf - and The Barber starring Malcolm McDowell. Many of these others are Canadian productions.

Ring Around the Rosie is an American production, but follows suit by featuring Tom Sizemore, an actor with some formidable credentials who turns in an absolutely stunning performance here. It's too bad this movie comes from the general thriller-mill and so doesn't get considered for any Academy Awards. If it did, Tom Sizemore would surely merit a nomination for his riveting portrayal of menace hiding behind amiable helpfulness.

Perhaps I have seen too many of these thrillers, so I've become a bit jaded. But I found the plot rather predictable. What may be intended as a twist-ending didn't quite twist for me. And the special effects camera work similarly struck me as cliche.

Overall, I was throuoghly impressed.",1144195200,8,359,4.634920634920635
2486720,5,B000E3L7EG,"I am a huge horror fan and I LOVED this film.  It was scary and kept me on the edge of my seat.  Tom Sizemore, who I love, was absolutely awesome--and SUPER creepy.  Gina Phillips and Jenny Mollen are really hot and alone are worth the few bucks I shelled out for the DVD.  Go check it out!",1144195200,9,290,3.9482758620689653
2486721,2,B000E3L7EG,"It's a shame that the writers, or the editors, or the director couldn't come up with an ending that tied an otherwise scary film together.  To often, it seems, horror pictures don't leave the watcher understanding what they just saw.  This is a classic example, it will leave you wondering what the heck just happened.",1144022400,2,318,4.763636363636364

You have to pay attention, or watch it a few times. I did anyway! Im still not sure which one of them is more crazy. In the movie that is. I mean Tom Sizemore or Gina Philips.",1469491200,,315,3.8615384615384616

8105325,1,B000E3L7EG,"This movie was very disappointing. The creators could have taken the plot and made it into something deeper and darker. It's as if the movie was made to rob you of your money and time. Don't get me wrong, the character development was excellent but there was no point in it. Do not waste your time trying to figure out this plot. There is nothing to be learned here but that it was a total waste. I cannot express the feelings I had for this movie. It will only raise your hopes to find that it will let you down. This movie had potential to be a hit but was ruined by poor writers. I can only imagine how awful their other works are. You would be better off staring at the dust motes in the air than this disgrace to scary movie fans. Absolutely flabbergasted.",1377043200,,761,4.219178082191781
8105326,1,B000E3L7EG,"There is no story; rather it seems as if the writer/director was really just putting together ""creepy"" moments without any thought for a story with a beginning, middle, and end.  How unfortunate...wish I could get those two hours back.",1342137600,,235,5.0256410256410255
8105327,1,B000E3L7EG,"This is a movie that attempts to unseat Troll 2 as the undisputed worst horror film ever. At least Troll 2 was so bad it was entertaining. There is nothing entertaining in this disaster, unless you are into soft core girl on girl incest. We have wet T-shirts, hugging, cuddling, spooning in bed, and even a pillow fight! Meow. What more could you ask from a whore movie? Oh wait, I meant horror movie, and a few scares would've been nice. The production team couldn't afford 100 monkeys and typewriters, so they opted for 5 alleged ""writers"" sequestered away in 5 different locations with no interaction between them, and instructed them to write a script and use the phrase ""Don't worry, I won't let you fall"". Those scripts were then put through a food processor and reassembled by Helen Keller to creat the working script. The director decided to try out as many edgy camera techniques as possible to see what works best in case he ever gets to make a ""real"" movie. You get to see shaky cam, blurry cam, blurry shaky cam, slo-mo, 45 degree shutter (Tom Sizemore stole that one from Saving Private Ryan, or was it 28 Days Later?) POV cam, and cam & cheese, heavy on the cheese. The acting was as bad as the direction as Gina Phillips over-reacted and hyperventilated through the whole movie. She was afraid of rats, roadkill, chickens, Pierce, reflections, wind, closets, slopes, ponies, swings, and her own shadow, not necessarily in that order. Maybe if Gina had been in the audience istead of on screen, this movie would've scared at least one person. Tom Sizemore alternated between creepily friendly, lecherous, and psycho violent at the flick of a switch. Wendy just stayed horny most of the time. The editing was utterly incoherent. One minute they would be eating dinner, then Karen & Wendy are running up the driveway to Wendy's car which won't start (not in a horror movie!! What are the odds? Oh the humanity.)then a brief flashback to Pierce attacking Karen in the closet, to Karen throwing up in the toilet, punching out the medicine cabinet, then seeing Wendy isn't in the bed (maybe she's trying to jump start the car) then cut to a scene of Wendy dancing with Pierce in the tack barn. All this in the space of about 2 min. All this jumping from location to location for no reason, intercut with flashbacks and hallucinations, makes the ""plot"" hard to follow. Fear not, for it will all become perfectly clear with the low-rent M. Night Shyamalan wannabe twist ending. Turns out Wendy has been dead for 17 years. Wait...oh crap...don't read that part. **Spoiler alert** Too late now I guess. If you put the clues together you come to the conclusion that Grandpa had molested Karen and was getting an eye for Wendy. When Karen tried to stop him, apparently Wendy was knocked off the balcony and died. The scenes in the movie were Karen exercising her demons and getting some kind of closure. Pierce personified Grandpa and was a figment of her imagination. It is a cheap cop-out to explain away huge plot holes as being the result of a delusional mind. Shame on you filmakers. If you were to rewatch the film with the foreknowledge that Pierce represents Bad Grandpa, then the painfully clumsy, bad dialog becomes a string of disturbing sexual double entendre. Phrases like: ""You've gotta show them who's boss and that they ARE going to be ridden."" ""Climb on, put your right hand here, don't squeeze your legs too tight, grab this, happy endings, wanna come with me, get in the bed, what do you do better than dance""? etc. I've seen a few thrillers like this lately that have resorted to the incest angle to create the antagonist. Giving Grandpas a bad name. This movie looked like a decent production cinematography wise, but was doomed by a lame script, weak premise, and horrible acting. The elements were there: house with red hallway, rats, fake deer that they got for half price because it was missing an antler, fake blood, tub, mirrors, wind and rain machines, guns and knives, axe, creepy music and boobies. What went wrong? I figure that the masochists among you will ignore advice to the contrary and insist on at least renting this mess just to see if it is really all that bad. A used copy is less than a buck, but then you have to pay shipping, and it is not worth it. If you happen to find a copy of this movie taped to a stick being used as a driveway reflector, then ""borrow"" it and see for yourself, but I don't recommend wasting any time or money on it. Don't worry, I won't let you fall.",1236124800,2,4522,4.61166253101737
8105328,3,B000E3L7EG,"I really like Tom Sizemore. I even liked him in THE RELIC, an otherwise putrid affair. I loved Gina Philips in JEEPERS CREEPERS, and yes, she's a hottie. My main problem w/ RING AROUND THE ROSIE is that it takes too long to get going and to get to the point. This would have made a fantastic episode of TWILIGHT ZONE / NIGHT GALLERY / ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS etc., w/ about 40 minutes shaved off. The story is interesting enough- girl plagued by ghostly / psychological / evil hauntings. It just needs a big trim. As it stands, it's not terrible / unwatchable, it's just bloated. After seeing it once, I watched it again, fast-forwarding through the parts I knew to be superfluous, and found it far more enjoyable. I recommend this technique...",1222300800,2,746,4.616541353383458
