7905636,5,B000009QEP,"Sue Price is the utmost perfect female specimen. Her body is flawless. The movie doesn't have much of a plot, but it's great to watch all the same. Sue Price makes the movie! If you like female body builders, this is a must see movie for you!",1169683200,,242,4.170212765957447
7905637,4,B000009QEP,"Albert Pyun certainly has a strong vision as a director. And Sue Price is a strong presence and has a beautiful physique. All three of the movies are worth seeing if you like post-apocalyptic stories, but this is the best. N2 is next, then N4, which is a little too much style and not the substance of the preceding two. The only thing I hated about this one is the flashbacks. They come early and often. The flashbacks themselves aren't bad. It's the crashing sounds in the soundtrack that had me verbally asking the movie to please stop it. Wow, that sound was obnoxious! Now, I turn the sound down when I watch the flashbacks. I have all three because I like Sue Price and besides some problems, I am a Pyun fan.",1059609600,3,715,4.383458646616542
7905638,3,B000009QEP,"First off let me just say I LOVE MUSCULAR WOMEN! The main reason why I rented this movie is because I am a longtime fan of Debbie Muggli. She was the ultimate in Women's Bodybuilding when she competed in the Early-Mid 90s! Now that that is out of the way, Nemesis 3:Time Lapse(NM3) was a fair effort as far as B Sci-Fi movies go. While NM3 does not quite pick up right where Nemesis 2 left off, there is a degree of continuity in the development of the Alex(Sue Price) character.  Instead of the She-Tarzan/Great White Huntress angle used in the previous movie, Alex is on a mission of survival. Instead of fighting some second rate predator type being, the adversaries this time are three androids. 2 of whom are played by other bodybuilding competitors-Sharon Bruneau and Debbie Muggli. The acting admittedly is not great but both Sharon and Debbie really show off their guns(huge arms) and the fact that they are(were) professional women bodybuilders as their voices, especially Sharon's, were more than a bit husky.  However I digress, The 3 men in the movie (I didn't remember their names) but the rogue character sure did provide some great comic relief. Alex's love interest(who I believed played Tarzan in a recent B-film remake) was pretty one-dimensional as a former hero fallen prey to battle wounds that left him a half-wit(think 'rain man' surviving the Ia Drang battle in We were soldiers"" and the boss villain android who seeks to take advanage of our chief protagonist. Oh and as far as our lead. I was surely dissapointed when in the opening scene which has her suffering amnesia and at the near mercy of the bad guys, Alex after being propsitioned by our chief antagonist-the boss android, she refused his advances. However in a confusing sequence towards the end, after a battle with his minions we see her dressing(SHE HAS AN EXCELLENT BEHIND!) presumably after having sex with one of her male cohorts. It is never revealed how she came to this point or why after engaging the seemingly invulnerable duo of Bruneau and Muggli they did not leave the immediate battle zone or exactly how Alex came into the boss Android's custody.  Overall and despite its confusing plot, not a bad movie. Definitely not great cinema but if you are a fan of impressive low budget special effects and fitness Bettys, Melissa Coates and Ursula Alberto(the former Mrs. Milos Sacrev) make cameos, then this is for you. Howeverif you want a more revealing(as in showing much more of Sue Price) then see the next in the series Nemesis 4:Cry of Angels.",1020297600,4,2546,4.781818181818182
