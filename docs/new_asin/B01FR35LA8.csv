7751345,5,B01FR35LA8,I am new watcher of the Regular Show. I liked this episode.  I can't wait for new episodes to see what happens next.,1351123200,,116,4.043478260869565
7751346,2,B01FR35LA8,"Regular show is great. I have been watching since it premiered. The way it is handled on dvd release, however, is not great. Things started off well enough with a bluray release of the first two seasons, but then the third season was only released on dvd. As if that was crappy enough, now the fourth season doesn't even get a proper release in the US, it is an import. With the 8th season about to air in two weeks, there is still no release dates for 5, 6, and 7. That seems like an awful lot of seasons to just abandon.

Adventure Time is getting a Bluray release for season 6 sometime in October. It pains me to see this series constantly getting dumped on.",1473724800,11,661,4.246031746031746

7751353,5,B01FR35LA8,"Advertisements for this show don't really do it justice. Regular Show brings the heat time after time and season 4 is no exception. Obscure '80s references, bizarre creatures, alternate dimensions, and of course hilarious violence. If you haven't seen this show yet, you don't know what you're  missing.",1428192000,,303,5.3125

7751358,4,B01FR35LA8,"At first this show is hilarious, but over time can be predictable.  They do surpise you occasionally and make you have those laugh out loud moments.  I do love Muscleman's ""my mom"" jokes.  Pops says the funniest things too",1381795200,3,222,4.641025641025641

Awesome Regular Show in History!",1373587200,5,107,4.35
7751360,5,B01FR35LA8,"I guess it's called ""regular show"" because no matter how silly and nonsensical the characters and episodes are, they're still always formulaic enough to be familiar and make sense anyway.  It's clever and funny.  The dialogue and character dynamics are hilarious and well-formed.  And some of the people's faces and voices on here are just perfect.",1373155200,,348,5.178571428571429
7751361,4,B01FR35LA8,Regular Show is funny and great for kids! Mordecai and Rigby make a great duo as they do amazing things!,1372291200,,104,4.25
7751362,5,B01FR35LA8,funny show i realy love it!  the comedy can be  bit crude and adult at some times (like i cant understand how cartoon network decided this was ok to air).,1369180800,,154,4.1
7751363,5,B01FR35LA8,mordo and rigs are my favorite cartoon characters.  i love all the throwbacks and old movie references and they pepper in just the right amount of adult humor.  Very funny show can't wait to watch more,1368921600,2,201,4.555555555555555

8761213,5,B01FR35LA8,I like it strictly based on content as it was the purchaser had a poor understanding of USA Non-USA format so now we either return it or purchase a regional code passing DVD player. We will probably do the later as we are huge Regular Show fans. Buyer beware when it says NON-USA format just beware and check your DVD player to insure compatibility in that sometimes it's worth the extra money to by the right product. Again I didn't buy the DVD and the actual purchaser didn't have a full understanding of NON-USA formatting. Caveat Emptor- Let the Buyer Beware!,1521072000,,563,4.584158415841584

8761215,5,B01FR35LA8,"I would really like to know when Cartoon Network plans to release this Regular Show 4th Season DVD set! I have bought Seasons 1, 2, and 3, and have been patiently waiting for quite a while now for them to release these other 2 seasons. What's up CN? Why are you waiting so long to release these two seasons for Region 1 players? Pick a short release date and lets get these seasons out ASAP. I can't purchase these 2 seasons if I'm dead! (Yes, I am older than 50, that's all I'll admit to!) Hey Cartoon Network ..... Lets go, lets go, lets go! (grin)",1496361600,,550,4.19811320754717
