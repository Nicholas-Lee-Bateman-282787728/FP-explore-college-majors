3065432,5,B0011FJPSQ,"The DVD is very informative, and the tech is easy to understand. The tech gives you many insites as he tears down the transmission. What to look for, worn or broken part than cause a certain problems.
The only thing that would help is a scematic to follow with the DVD. If you don't work on transmissions every day, you can loose your place as to what is being worked on.",1247875200,3,371,4.23943661971831

8241783,4,B0011FJPSQ,"It was great,but I also wanted the book?",1422921600,,40,4.125
8241784,4,B0011FJPSQ,Most informative but he does move fairly quick through the process,1413158400,,66,5.090909090909091
8241785,5,B0011FJPSQ,"excellent video, i am a beginner at building a transmission  and the teardown was simple using the video, i have not started the rebuild but believe it will go smooth as well.",1378857600,,175,4.46875
8241786,5,B0011FJPSQ,"I've learned a lot about cars over the years and I feel very capable when it comes to servicing my own vehicles. The one thing I've noticed is not many ""mechanics"" will even attempt an automatic transmission if they don't specialize in transmissions. This DVD will remove some of the mystery behind the automatic transmission. The DVD was shot in standard and not widescreen, but that does not take away from the information presented in the video. I think this is a must for anyone with an interest in automatic transmissions and their operation. Until more videos are made available, this might be the best source before taking on any automatic transmission.",1376870400,,660,4.901785714285714
8241787,5,B0011FJPSQ,"Step by step instructions, clear video and it was very thorough. Highly recommend this product for anyone doing their first rebuild.",1374451200,,132,5.333333333333333
8241788,4,B0011FJPSQ,"Just spending the time watching the movie sets you up for success tearing down and rebuilding a 700r4. He performs the teardown right in front of the camera, and just that prevents the unfortunate glossing over of simple(but can be very difficult) pieces.
I gave it 4 stars because as awesome as the video was you need another reference for torque values and part numbers to get a complete picture, the 700r4 comes in many configurations and he just works on one.",1373760000,,463,4.658536585365853
8241789,4,B0011FJPSQ,"A good DVD with plenty of information and advice on strip down and rebuild.
Would like to see a bit more information on performance builds",1370476800,,138,4.56
8241790,5,B0011FJPSQ,"This DVD was GREAT I have never rebuild a transmission before or have even taken one apart the most I have done is change the fluid and filter this step by step DVD was very detailed, having said that using the DVD I was able to rebuild my transmission put it in and it works great I would highly recommend this DVD",1353542400,5,315,4.096774193548387
8241791,5,B0011FJPSQ,"this is very informative, especially if you have not rebuilt one before. almost fells like hands on just watching the video.",1327363200,3,124,4.9523809523809526
