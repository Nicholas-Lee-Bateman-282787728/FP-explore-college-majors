8079776,5,B000ATJNN6,"""Classical guitar performance"" sees the great English guitarist play about 1 hours worth of pieces from the standard Classical/Spanish guitar repertoire.

The pieces played here are Espanoleta and Canarios (Sanz), Granada(Albeniz), C.Arabe (Tarrega) Bach Lute Suite in Em , Adelita,Lagrima,Maria(Tarrega),Variations on a Theme of Mozart  (F.Sor), Recuerdos de la Alhambra (Tarrega), Spanish Romance and finally Asturias (Albeniz)

The setting is quite intimate in that it has been filmed in the studio without a live audience. Bonell is well lit agains a dark background bringing him and in particular his beautiful Smallman guitar into sharp focus.

The technical aspect of this DVD is very interesting as there's a multi-angle option which is available the whole way through. This allowes you to watch a close up of left or right hand at any point which I found extremely useful as a guitarist studying some of these pieces.

There are additional bonus features where Carlos Bonell gives a brief spoken insight as to techniques required to play each piece as well as some ideas about interpreting the pieces. (He does this again in Spanish on separate menus)

The playing throughout is of an extremely high standard but what sets Bonell apart from most other great players it seems to me is his range of tone which he is constantly changing to great effect.

The stand out pieces for me were ""Canarios"" which features his own quirky introduction and the complex Sor Variations. It was also great to see close-up footage of the entire Bach  Lute Suite as well as his own re-working of Spanish Romance.

I would say that this DVD is great for anyone who plays Classical guitar as you really get up close, so to speak to one of today's guitar greats. For anyone who's not a guitar player it still makes for an extremely enjoyable viewing.",1163376000,6,1837,4.977124183006536
