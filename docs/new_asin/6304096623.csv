7862565,5,6304096623,As the title says it's a chi kung workout not a fitness workout. It is for energizing and healing the internal organs. Done twice a day over a period of time you will begin to feel why the Chinese healing arts are so powerful. Dr. Johnson is very knowledgeable having trained for many years and in China. The movements in this video can be done by most people regardless of age. I found it very relaxing and was full of energy by the end of the workout. Highly recommended.,1280620800,,473,4.325842696629214

At the same time, detailed instructions are given by the narrator while you  are performing the workout. The background scenery is a visual workout all  its own.  You will not be disappointed!",959472000,32,340,5.0
