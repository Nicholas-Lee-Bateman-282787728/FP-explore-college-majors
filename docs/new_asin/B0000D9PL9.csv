8556993,4,B0000D9PL9,"""Cadena perpetua"" (""Life Sentence"") from 1978 was directed by Arturo Ripstein (""El castillo de la pureza"" 1973, ""El imperio de la fortuna"" 1986, ""Profundo carmesi"" 1996, etc.). In this film, we have an excellent analysis and examination of the Mexican judicial system. It had an excellent cast: Pedro Armendariz Jr. ('Javier Lira' 'el Tarzan'), Narciso Busquets ('Comandante Prieto'), Ernesto Gomez Cruz ('Cabo Pantoja'), Angelica Chain ('Rosa Martinez'), Roberto Cobo ('Gallito'), Ana Ofelia Mungia ('Sra. Romero'), Yolanda Rigel ('Ojitos'), Pilar Pellicer ('Pantoja's wife'), Ana Martin ('maid'), Antonio Bravo ('Sr. Romero'), etc. 'Javier Lira' better known by his former street-moniker: 'el Tarzan', is a reformed petty-thief (he served time in a harsh island-prison), who now works for a bank and has managed to make a new life for himself. When a bank employee gets beaten and robbed (resulting in the death of one of the assailants), his past suddenly comes back to haunt him! Arturo Ripstein did an excellent job here, by showing the corruption that's endemic to Mexico, but encompassing all of Latin America too. And the desperation of those that are caught in its web, like 'el Tarzan'. The film went from the present to the past (via flashbacks) to the present again, without jeopardizing the plot or continuity. Pedro Armendariz Jr. did an excellent job portraying 'el Tarzan'. All the supporting players were also very good. Ana Martin even had a small role as a maid (with brief-nudity). Arturo Ripstein, along with Alberto Isaac and Jaime Humberto Hermosillo, has made some of the most thought-provoking films to have ever come out of Mexico (especially in the 70's and 80's). This is a riveting and fast-paced thriller that does not let-up to the very end. It was also produced by Conacine: the former Mexican state-owned film co. The DVD picture quality by Desert Mountain is very good. NTSC, Spanish (English subtitles), NR 95 mins.
