7999127,2,B0000CDLAT,"THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THE MANY GANGSTA MOVIES THAT CONTINUE TO LINE UP ON THE SHELVES OF VIDEO STORES ALL ACROSS AMERICA. IN THIS ONE, TWO YOUNG MUSICIANS STEAL A HOT SONG THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO THEM. THE SONG UNEXPECTEDLY BECOMES A HIT FOR THEM AND WHEN THE ORIGINAL OWNER FINDS OUT ABOUT IT, HE TRYS TO KILL THEM. THIS IS NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE OTHER GANGSTA MOVIES. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ON THE COVER FOR THIS MOVIE, COOLIO AND CLIFTON POWELL BOTH HAVE SMALL ROLES. A MAN NAMED GEORGIO [WHO ALSO IS THE DIRECTOR] IS THE REAL STAR OF THE MOVIE. YOU MIGHT BE BETTER OFF RENTING THIS ONE INSTEAD OF BUYING IT. MS. TOI ALSO HAS A ROLE IN THIS MOVIE.",1073347200,3,669,4.1937984496124034
