3922352,5,B002FLZM9G,"Heather Beers continues to shine on the screen; she carries each scene she is in. She is the Olivia de Havilland of the Christian Movie community.

The movie is very touching; it gives hope and comfort. Well worth the watch.",1361577600,,224,4.6

3922354,5,B002FLZM9G,This movie brings you to realize how important friendship is and how valuable life is . This story really reflects on true relationships and how we can sharpen each other in many ways.,1361404800,,184,4.606060606060606
3922355,5,B002FLZM9G,"Love the movie.  It was fun and touching with a little twist i the middle I didn't expect.  Buy it, you'll like it.",1360108800,,115,3.9565217391304346
3922356,2,B002FLZM9G,"Some parts of this movie are ok, but there is a bizarre segment in the middle that really turned me off.",1354665600,6,104,4.0
3922357,1,B002FLZM9G,"I got this movie thinking it was a Christian based film (a movie with a Christian worldview). In the description of the movie it says ""with the faith that inspired them as children"". However, the faith they are talking about is not the Christian faith but Mormonism. Evidently this movie was made by a Mormon group and includes scenes where Mormon missionaries are teaching about their beliefs. These scenes seem to be trying to also evangelize the rest of us to Mormonism. What they are talking about is a different path that does not lead to salvation. Salvation is through faith in Jesus, not the Latter-Day Saints (Mormonism).

 I would've liked if they at least made it clear somewhere, who this movie was made by-the LDS. Then, I could've understood the real point of the movie, before I spent my money.",1350604800,10,809,4.7304964539007095
3922358,4,B002FLZM9G,"I love movies that my whole family can watch (which is getting more and more difficult these days), so I was excited this was on demand at Amazon. This was an entertaining family movie. It's really about the two women who were once very close and then drifted apart coming back together and reminiscing about a special summer when they were girls and the things they did as kids. Let's just say the girls stirred up some trouble that made us laugh. It kept my 6- and 9-year-olds interested and was not too slow or chick-flicky for my husband. When he read the synopsis, he said ""boring!"" but then he really got into it and enjoyed it. As for me, I would definitely recommend it!",1341878400,19,678,4.432
3922359,2,B002FLZM9G,"One of the reasons I purchased this movie was based upon a customer review that was posted on Amazon which gave this movie a five star rating.  You've got to be kidding me.  I am usually very generous with my ratings, but this movie was pathetic.  It is proof that you shouldn't believe everything you read.  I loved Heather Beers in Charley, so I was excited to see her again in this movie.  The acting across the board was very poor, and what was up with the scene of the dead boy from the 1940's?  That was just flat out creapy!  Why in the world was that in the movie?!  Really strange.  Don't waste your money on this one. Take my word for it.",1303084800,15,648,4.161290322580645
3922360,5,B002FLZM9G,"ONCE UPON A SUMMER is a film that will touch the heart and mind of many LDS movie-lovers. Director Rob Diamond has created a touching film about finding and holding dear the things that really matter in life; friendship, family, truth. Actress Heather Beers has a role worthy of her talents (she was the lead in CHARLY) and her co-star Sussanne Sutchy is excellent as her best friend. The two young girls who play these best friends as children are equally wonderful. This is a film that will enrich the viewers life and one that they will likely want to share with others. This is a ""Gem"" well worth experiencing. High marks must also be given to the camera man and composer.",1256860800,24,676,4.549180327868853

3922384,1,B002FLZM9G,"This movie is not only bad, it  is evil. It promotes the false teaching of the Mormon church that salvation comes through baptism,giving up smoking and drinking, being ""perfect"".  You realize it is a Mormon  film about 1/3 of the way in. Let the buyer beware and stay away!",1485820800,,273,4.530612244897959

3922407,2,B002FLZM9G,There is nothing to the plot. It is about shifts in attitude towards life. There was no climax. The ending was lousy.,1477267200,,117,4.363636363636363

3922433,4,B002FLZM9G,"This movie is a mixture of joy, sadness, faith, and how two young lives helped shape who they have become even when the circumstances were difficult. Together these two friends/cousins reminisce about the past that in turn helps bring joy and direction to their futures.

3922439,2,B002FLZM9G,"Story of 2 girls (cousins/best friends) always together as children After years apart, they reconnect. A bit strange in places, with young boys as church ""elders"" seemed kind of phony. Also has a young boy's ghost which really makes it strange.  Watched on Prime",1473033600,,262,4.954545454545454

3922461,3,B002FLZM9G,Cinematography was good. Segment concerning the disappearing ghost boy was strange to say the least. The movie would be more interesting to people of the Mormon faith as there is strong emphasis on conversion to mormonism.,1473033600,,222,5.194444444444445

3922475,3,B002FLZM9G,"We did enjoy the movie and the story of the girls.  We felt the dead boy appearing made a sentimental movie creepy and demonic.

3922493,3,B002FLZM9G,"Generally OK.  One major issue is the girls talking to the ghost of a dead boy.  This is an LDS-centric movie and that REALLY derailed the feeling of the movie.  Not an LDS concept.

Also - the fact that the Lawyer felt she had to quit her job to be with her kids - and send her husband to work.  It's a nice thing for her to do, but makes it sound like it was the only option.  She certainly could have cut her hours and stopped flirting around with other men.",1467504000,,461,3.9565217391304346

Half way through the movie, a ghost kid pops up and scared the crap out of us. My son is 4 and daughter 8....They are terrified. Some kinda wierd Mormon movie. Wow. I will have to deal with this for quite some time I am sure. Lots of prayer, reassurance, and telling them this is just a crappy movie. Beware parents. The write up doesnt say anything about the dark twist of a dead boy's spirit talking to the girls as children and trying to show them a dead boy's body........sickos!!!

3922519,2,B002FLZM9G,"This was not my kind of movie.  A beautiful young woman finds out she has cancer and not much longer to live.  Instead of calling her spouse, she calls her life long friend.  Her friend drops what shes doing and they head to a park a sit on swings and from there the movie flashes back to childhood scenes.  This helps her friend to see some changes she needs to make in her own life and to focus on what is really important in life.  They don't focus on her suffering or dying process, which is good, it just goes from finding out, to the scene in the park, the flash backs and discussions, then the end and the memories that will live on.",1461110400,,640,4.129032258064516

3922570,3,B002FLZM9G,"This movie was slightly disappointing.  I was looking for a movie that is faith based with a positive message, Once Upon a Summer does not fit that description.  I really enjoyed the scenes of the girls growing up in 1978.  That was a different time and it was fun seeing how different it truly was!  It was also refreshing to see a movie that was based on female childhood friends having adventures and getting into trouble.  Movies with this type of story line about childhood friends and memories are predominantly based on males as the main characters (think Stand By Me), so this was a nice change.  The actual story line is  where my disappointment comes in.  First of all it is unrealistic.  A woman just diagnosed with terminal cancer talking with her best friend, and she's giving the friend advice about her life?  I find it hard to believe she accepted this terrible fate so easily.  The ending was pretty sad as well- and I'm not sure how faith came into the picture other than to show how Lisa did get her priorities straight after this talk.  The part about the girls seeing the ghost was a little scary, but it was cute and I enjoyed it- although it was a departure from the rest of the movie so I can see why other reviewers made complaints.  I'm not sure this movie is really that family friendly, maybe older teens would be okay with it, but definitely not children.  It was free on Prime, so that's why it got 3 stars instead of two, but I wouldn't spend money on this one.",1450396800,2,1492,4.417582417582418

My 2-star rating comes primarily from the fact that they concealed that this was a LDS production.  Usually faith-based videos make it obvious what perspective they are coming from.

3922750,3,B002FLZM9G,"I loved how the film started out with scenes of summers past enjoyed by best friends/cousins.  I knew when the girls were talking about being baptized the next day, it had to be an LDS story, which was confirmed when the missionaries came walking up the street. I loved that element of the movie. And the elders indeed reflected what those young missionaries are like in the real world out there in the mission field.

But, the acting in this film, except for the elders, was unrealistic, exaggerated, and even corny at times. If the neighbors were supposed to depict what the typical Mormon family is like, the writers missed the mark big time. The film seemed to be an attempt to make active Mormons look like oblivious ""snooty, judgmental goody-goodies"" while making the grandparents look like good ole folk who stay away from church simply to avoid being ""judged"" because they smoke and drink. The girls squeaking in one more prank before getting baptized the next day was in poor taste.

Finally, the bit about the spirit boy, what was that about?  Made no sense whatsoever.

I would agree with some of the other reviews on this film that it is not one I would have wanted to watch with my children when they were young.  It was an ""okay"" film for me, however. I've seen lives change because of the efforts of the missionaries, and that part of the film was touching.  So was the relationship between the two cousins.",1406764800,,1422,4.619047619047619

Out of the blue comes some paranormal encounter with the ghost of a drowned boy. This is presented as though this is just part of a regular story. By the end you learn it is all the recollections of an exec who got too close to the edge of selfishness and is also grieving he loss of her dear friend who she hopes made it to the same place as the nice(if not freaky) ghost boy because she was baptized Mormon-style to wash away her sins (incidentally, in he same water that the boy drowned in).

I wasn't sure if I should be entertained, scared, or confused. I felt the creators were trying too hard to entertain with a touch of edginess and the unexpected, but it was poorly executed. It only made me wish they'd put more energy into directing the actors. The concept of friendship and how to value life is clear but the unraveling of this moral through the plot isn't as clear.

The poor quality of acting disrupts the story especially the one-dimensional minor characters. The lack of depth makes it almost comical. Fortunately the two young actresses portraying the two cousins are talented. They make the movie slightly more palatable but not enough to overcome the other major flaws. Disappointed that it wasn't more clear and better quality acting.

It's not an entire wreck because they have some touching moments along with some comical ones too but they're overwhelmed by the lack of integrity with the plot and acting.",1394064000,,1109,4.862433862433862

Honestly, I think most of the actors could have done a decent job if they'd been given half a chance with a somewhat decent script but the story itself was just badly executed. The movie is a strange blend of ""Now and Then,"" ""Stand By Me,"" and ""Charly,"" with a little bit of ""The Ghost Whisperer"" thrown in (yep, two 8 year girls ACTUALLY ""cross a ghost"" in one EXTREMELY bizarre scene). Also, yes, this IS a movie told from the LDS perspective (which didn't both me since I myself am Mormon) but please PLEASE stop saying that this movie is done BY ""the Mormons."" It's not. It may have been WRITTEN by Mormons, FOR Mormons, but the Mormon church had NOTHING to do with this piece of cinematic offal. It's DEFINITELY not doctrinal in ANY way, shape, or form other than the conversation had by the girls about being baptized washing away all of your sins (although they get off track when they say that after they get baptized they can't do anything bad ever again, which flies in the face of the Mormon emphasis on repentance).

If you're looking for some good Mormon movies to watch, I recommend ""Baptists at Our Barbecue,"" ""The Best Two Years"" (!!!), ""The Singles Ward,"" or ""Charly"" (that last one especially if you're looking for a little insight into Mormon teachings on the afterlife).

8369174,5,B002FLZM9G,I'm not religious. But that is only because of what I have experienced in my past. It doesn't matter how you pray or who you pray too.  It's that you pray from the heart and the soul. Love this movie.  I hope you will also. Pure and Perfect!!!!,1496102400,,244,4.0625
8369175,1,B002FLZM9G,"If I could give it 0 I would. Possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. From the script to the production, everything was awful. The development of the lead characters and their friendship was not believable. You have to sit through a lot of rubbish for a kernel of redemption.. The scene with the ghost was horrific. How could this be in a mormon/ latter day saints movie..(. I can't remember which this was. )  do they believe in ghosts? Honestly please don't waste your time. Run, and save your kids some bad ideas and nightmares.",1492387200,,542,4.474747474747475
8369176,5,B002FLZM9G,"Beautiful movie. As many pointed out, it has Mormon tones but was really only evident based on the depiction of the 2 missionaries (Elders) who visit the grandparents a few times during the movie. Even though I am not LDS, I loved this movie. The compassion and acceptance portrayed by the missionaries towards the Grandparents who smoked and drank - was just sweet. I felt the missionaries portrayal was a true testament to how Christians should treat others, non-judgmentally and welcoming despite, ""bad habits."" This movie was filled with bittersweet moments and real life depth. I can't see any reason to dislike this movie! I will definitely watch it again and that's saying a lot since I rarely watch a movie more than once. :) If you aren't biased against the LDS church, you will enjoy this film about two BFF cousins raised every Summer together, bonded by the mutual absence of their parents and their loving, rough-around-the-edges Grandparents.",1491782400,2,956,5.018867924528302
