7798690,5,1574922823,Jeff Daniels is so talented as illustrated in Redwood Curtain!,1404432000,,62,5.3
7798691,2,1574922823,The play is much better. The movie omitted the magic central to the young woman's character. Watch the movie:  you'll see/feel something is missing.,1390089600,,148,5.166666666666667
7798692,5,1574922823,"The Redwood Curtain was special because it included the ""Making of Redwood Curtain."" It was interesting to hear each actor explain how they felt about their part.  I highly recommend this Hallmark movie . Lea Salonga was an excellent actor as were the major actors. I received my product in excellent time, considering I live in Honululu.

7798693,5,1574922823,"The first time I saw this film I was awe-struck because I lived in the mtns. where there were a large number of Vietnam vets hiding just as this film portrays. I had always wished I'd purchased the film, but didn't. Recently, I stumbled across it in a library & enjoyed it all over again. I was captivated by the story line and acting from beginning to end & won't miss purchasing it this time around!",1279756800,5,401,4.2894736842105265
7798694,5,1574922823,"A wonderful movie with fine performances by a great ensemble cast.  The whole film, from start to finish is excellent.  Lithgow's performance as an adoptive father striving to encourage his adopted daughter's, Salonga, musical career will touch a lot of buttons.  Her longing to know her birth family is topical as well as intensely personal, a good blend.  The adoptive mother flits in and out; obviously not all that interested in her adoptive daughter.  Lithgow's sudden death leads to to a further estrangement between mother and daughter.  A trip to visit Lithgow's sister starts a whole new series of events for Salonga and her meeting with Daniels and all that comes from that.  The ending is a complete surprise but at the same times, explains much.  A well crafted and performed movie.  Even the small roles are done well, be it in a lumbar yard, vet's center or in the cemetery.  This film touches a number of issues, adoption, emotional pain AKA PTSD, personal developement and the maturing process of a teenager.  All are captured in this film and the result is a fine effort that should be in every video library.",979516800,31,1126,4.8125
7798695,5,1574922823,"Although this film has the same kind of background as the plot in Miss Saigon,it seems to have a strange ""freshness"" about it. I think that the introduction of Miss Lea Salonga into this cast was the perfect  choice for this story. She was of course the original girl to play Kim in  the London cast of Miss Saigon. Her ""Newness""to film acting comes  through now and again,but it was a good performance,and a good story with a  little twist at the end.",958608000,11,452,4.409638554216867
7798696,2,1574922823,"A great premise, and even more promising cast. However, Salonga's acting is terribly disappointing. She's very theatrical, possibly from her then-recent Miss Saigon experience. Expect a pretty slow-pace film.",948412800,4,208,6.206896551724138
