8006408,5,B00014K5QY,"After being drawn into the war between the Empire and Republic, Van and his friends fight in the battle of Red River. This is a key battle in the war. They also encounter a mad scientist who becomes a great friend and valuable ally in their journey. After their meeting with Dr. D., they encounter a boy with a black organoid. The boy, Raven, and his organoid, Shadow will become their greatest foe and take the lives of many innocent people.

This series is really fun. There are lots of cool characters, action, drama, comedy, and a pretty engrossing plot. I'd say that this series borders on addicting. When it was on TV at 5:30 in the morning all those years ago, I actually woke up, watched it, and went back to sleep before going to high school at 8am. It takes a hell of a good show to get me up that early in the morning. The only complaint I have is the price. I started collecting Zoids when it was first coming out. It seems like the DVD's were around $10 or $15 new back then. I've seen the prices of them now, and I think it's ridiculous. They are out of print, and there are more and more people that will hold on to them once they get them. If you find a decent deal on them, I'd jump on it. It looks like the whole series will run about $700. I would like to see them released again since they are rare. Anyway, this series is a lot of fun, and I highly recommend it to anime fans of all ages.",1354924800,2,1409,4.123636363636364

8006410,3,B00014K5QY,"This dvd is part of a 11 disc set.

This is volume 2 and can not be found anywhere.

I have the whole chaotic centure set besides this.

I don't know why no one is selling it used.  I need this dvd because I don't know what happens

I am disapointed taht amazon canceled my order because it was out of stock.  I can't find this anywhere and would pay at least $30 for this alone.",1210896000,,379,3.9210526315789473
8006411,3,B00014K5QY,"First off this is a review of Zoids Choatic Century series as a whole. Second I would have given this a 3.5 if I could.

ZCC is by far the best zoids series in the franchise. That still isn't saying much, this is just your average big robo anime. The voice acting is okay, the graphics again okay, the plot is slightly above average. This is a long series that has a lot twists but its just not the amazing legendary anime everyones making it out to be. Make no mistake this is nowhere near the league of say gundam or EVA. This is your anime you pop in if you have kids or just want something to do du to. Normally I would say save your money but the series cost 12.99 each brand new so try it out if you like then go on if you don't then you only wasted 12 dollors not a terrible waste.",1167523200,,788,3.9559748427672954
8006412,5,B00014K5QY,I love raven he is so kawii! but any ways finnaly getting some real fights going here. we are now introdused to gunther prozen the main villain and his little one maned army raven with his red zaber fan and his black organoid shadow! raven on his very own took out 30 sleepers! but any way he is easyly the best pioliot van ever faces and probly the best throuout the show. this dvd contains info on irvine and his command wolf special (no one else has his kind wolf) as so far can play as whole or chapters.,1120953600,,508,4.141414141414141
