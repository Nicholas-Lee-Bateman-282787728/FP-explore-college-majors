8096809,2,B000CC2GTY,"I don't have any doubts about L Zinn knowing his shit, however, he didn't present the material sequentially. I felt I was being taken from step 1 to 3 to 5 and missing out on 2 and 4 which just left me scratching my head and not really learning a whole lot. I did get a few tidbits here and there, but not enough to be satisfied with the purchase. I give it 1 1/2 stars.",1379721600,,370,3.8815789473684212

8096811,3,B000CC2GTY,"I can't believe the 5 star reviews this video got. On a lot of topics, I have found better information on youtube. On Some things the info is good like hydraulic brakes maintenance but overall this video was almost a complete disappointment. Most topics are not explained completely. Spend your money on a good book instead. If you are a true novice then you will enjoy the initial insight into things but if you have any experience with bikes you may be upset you spent money on this as I was. 3 stars because I did learn something.",1208736000,4,533,4.448979591836735
8096812,5,B000CC2GTY,"What can I add that hasn't already been said earlier?

If you can get the book and the dvd. This has been a great introduction for myself as I wanted to learn how to best maintain my mountain bike. It has proven to be very accessible for even a beginner like myself and yet not feel like I'm being talked down to by the author.

I only recently bought this and already some of the maintenance & repairs I've done have saved some serious cash. Now as I walk into the local bicycle shop I know what I need for the tasks at hand.

For the maintenance and repairs I do now I save myself money and also I spare the time of the local bicycle mechanics by not taking it in for maintenance jobs I can now do. They have noted this and do appreciate it.",1191801600,7,743,4.040816326530612
8096813,5,B000CC2GTY,"When I got my first job at a bike shop, my boss handed me a copy of Zinn and the Art of Mountain Bike Maintenance and said ""read this by next week."" Lennard has been making bicycle maintenance instruction manuals for 11 years and has perfected teaching in a way that we can all understand.  His latest teaching tool comes on DVD.

Zinn and the Art of Mountain Bike Maintenance (DVD) is a fully comprehensive manual for mountain bike maintenance, repair, and component installation. The material is presented in a manner that is clear and easy to understand in even in the most intricate procedures. This DVD is a wonderful introduction for the would be mechanic, acts as powerful reference tool before starting more complicated repairs, and is great way for solid mechanics to learn some of Lennard's many tricks.

 If you ride frequently you have undoubtedly realized how expensive and inconvenient it is to bring your bike to a shop every time it needs servicing, which is arguably before every ride. For this reason many bike enthusiasts also become a do-it-yourself bike mechanic. There is no better way to familiarize yourself with the basics on how to keep your beloved steed running perfectly than to watch to Lennard explain it on this informative DVD.

Perhaps the most amazing aspect of this instruction manual is how Lennard breaks down even the most complicated repairs into step-by-step procedures that we can all understand. This enables intermediate mechanics to be confident with advanced procedures. Zinn overhauls a Shimano and Mavic hub, several different style headsets, and even a complicated Fox fork. I found the section on disc brakes quite helpful; Lennard bleeds a Shimano XT, Avid Juicy 7, Hayes El Camino, and Hayes Sole and Nine hydraulic disk brake. He also talks about how the job differs with other popular models. These are just a few of the repairs Lennard explains as the DVD does a very thorough job of covering every part of a mountain bike. In some sections there are even multiple explanations of the same job: one using basic tools and one that explains how to use the cool really ones that make life easy.

Zinn's new DVD doesn't replace or outdate his books, but instead complements them. Lennard suggests watching the relevant video sections before attempting unfamiliar repairs, then keeping the book handy for reference while you are working. In this way Lennard has created a multimedia-learning tool that is particularly effective for reaching people of all different learning styles.

I have been a professional mechanic for several years and still I learned a few things from Zinn's DVD. I liked it so much that I have lent it to several other mechanics at the shop; it gets two big thumbs up from me! My only question is: what's next? Maybe Zinn and The Art of Mountain Bike Maintenance, book on CD?!",1144713600,25,2850,4.87603305785124
