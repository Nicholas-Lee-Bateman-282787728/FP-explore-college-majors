2769046,4,B000NIVNC8,"After seeing Maria Isabel which is really one of the best Telenovelas, and the acting of Noriega is super, I expected more from this DVD.

Dulce Decafio is just a bit over the middle.",1186444800,,183,4.382352941176471
2769047,2,B000NIVNC8,"Though Adela Noriega is my all time favorite female protagonista (female lead) and Eduardo Yanez is one of my favorite male protagonista I did not enjoy this telenovela.  It did have 3 CDs but I didn't think the plot of the novela had substance and didn't think it flowed well.  Being a fan of telenovelas I know how a novela should flow and felt that this one was a bit off.  For true fans I would say that it is a ""nice"" novela to add to your collection but it is not a ""must"" have.",1182729600,4,484,4.073684210526316
2769048,5,B000NIVNC8,"This is an excellent Tv novela in all sense. The story, the acting, the editing was excellent! A must see!!! A must to add to the collection!!!",1181347200,3,143,4.333333333333333
2769049,5,B000NIVNC8,"I just finished watching this telenovela, abridged to 12 hours on 3 double sided discs. While on other telenovelas released one can really feel the editing, this one however really felt as if the whole story was present!

I don't know if this telenovela was on for a short period of time or there were simply lots of filler scenes that allowed themselves to be easily removed, but the whole telenovela moves seamlessly and you really see their hatred, friendship and subsequent love affair really blossom. It just doesn't happen in an instant.

Originally aired in 1988 in Mexico, this telenovela was criticized for glorifying teacher-student love affairs. Whilst I do agree, it serves for an entertaining and trashy soap. Though not my favourite of the DVD-telenovela bunch, ""Dulce Desafio"" was entertaining enough and certainly felt more complete than alot of the others released.",1179878400,12,882,5.118055555555555

Quality on the disc. Like other viewers stated not worth returning paying for another just to be disappointed again...",1451779200,,172,4.766666666666667

8177960,5,B000NIVNC8,"As someone who buys these ""abridged"" telenovela DVD's often, I can genuinely say that as far as editing goes, ""Dulce Desafo"" is the absolute best one I have come across. While even in the better edited DVD's, you can still tell that it is missing many parts, this edited version flows incredibly smoothly. I always knew exactly what was going on and never even once felt like there was something obviously missing. People who are worried about being confused as to what's going on in the storyline won't have to worry when it comes to this one. I have never seen the original televised version, but by the end of the story, it truly felt like everything was wrapped up and concluded wonderfully. I highly reccomend this DVD to anyone who is interested in buying telenovelas on DVD. This is one of the very few, if not only cases that proves that these shorter versions, WHEN DONE CORRECTLY, can work very well.

As far as the telenovela itself, I thoroughly enjoyed the realistic storyline and Adela Noriega's performance alone makes this worth buying. She is one of the best actresses the telenovela world has ever had, and if you haven't had the chance to see any of her past work, ""Dulce Desafo"" is a wonderful introduction.

It's not the best telenovela you will ever come across, but it's enjoyable enough.",1345766400,,1311,4.695652173913044
8177961,3,B000NIVNC8,"Let me say first that I love those couple, Adela and Eduardo are both gorgeous and they have great chemistry and if it was only about them i would've gave them 6 stars, but I did not based my opinion on this telenovela! This a nice story although the whole teacher- student - shrink - patient relationship is a little sick and unacceptable
But if they wanted to bring this telenovela to DVD why not pick ""Guadalope"" which is also old and with same couple but 100 times better and I really see it as the BEST TELENOVELA EVER. And if anyone does have it on DVD I am willing to pay him/her 100 dollars for it and that's how good I think it is!",1299542400,,640,4.128
8177962,2,B000NIVNC8,Goddness I could not wait for it to be over it was extremely boring.  I like adela noriega but she was so not her on this soap.  It could be the age factor that she was really young on thi particular soap.  I was not engaged at all on this soap.  This is one of the boring soap that I have and would not watch again.  It will be on my book stand for ever.,1264809600,,355,3.68
