6446232,5,B00KTHPRCU,"I love original movies like this.  A home-schooled son of a free-spirited and loner mother is suddenly left on his own when his mother gets sick.  He avoids those who come to help him and heads into the woods, where he meets a different kind of free-spirited fellow.  The film is mesmerizing and makes you really care about the people involved.",1409184000,13,344,4.60655737704918
6446233,4,B00KTHPRCU,"I enjoyed this so much.  Lili Taylor always chooses her roles in portraying unique, off-beat characters and is so talented.  The young boy was very good as well.  This indie film is an example of why I love non-Hollywood productions and seldom watch anything but indies and foreigns.",1407801600,17,283,4.854166666666667

8661393,5,B00KTHPRCU,"Indy films are an attraction, because every once in awhile you watch one that turns-out to be really well done. Such is the case with The Cold Lands.

The plot, acting, cinematography and flow of this film all fit nicely together.  This appears to be Silas Yelich's first film, yet he fits so comfortably into the role of young teenage Atticus. I'll be watching from more from this young fellow.

Lili Taylor portrayal of his Mother was so sweet, even when assuming a somewhat creepy role.

There's no high-drama here, but the way the characters interact - both while alive and after - make this a really enjoyable film for a quiet peaceful night at home.",1467158400,,655,4.620689655172414

8661395,5,B00KTHPRCU,"Beautifully filmed, great soundtrack, tremendous acting, and a totally thought provoking story. This is worth seeing several times.",1421539200,2,131,6.333333333333333
8661396,2,B00KTHPRCU,"too slow for me, it's been done too many times. it drags, the dialogue is too slow. there was potential here.",1421452800,,109,4.238095238095238
8661397,4,B00KTHPRCU,"A very good movie with a very good plot, but somewhat unrealistic for todays America. It is possible that 50 years ago, this story could unfold as it is told in this movie but in todays world, once the boy was missing for a few hours, the police would set up a dragnet for miles around the area where he disappeared and they would not stop searching until the man the boy befriended, was arrested and the boy was put in institutional care under State guardianship. Also, the boy is out in the public quite a bit. The possibility that the 2 of them could have been able to conduct their lives as they did without somebody recognizing the boy from media and posters is almost an impossibility. The boy is very comely. People would take notice and report his whereabouts to police very quickly.",1418428800,2,791,4.462068965517242
8661398,5,B00KTHPRCU,"I loved this. Very character driven, keeps you guessing.",1412985600,2,56,5.333333333333333
