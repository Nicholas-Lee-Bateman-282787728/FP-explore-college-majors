8752210,1,B01C4HYTDU,Wrong region so I did not get to even watch it.,1496966400,,47,3.3636363636363638
8752211,3,B01C4HYTDU,Beware all shoppers. This DVD is a region 2 disc and will not play in a region 1 player. Thank goodness my computer's DVD ROM drive can play a region 2 disc in English. The best thing about CSI on DVD is there are no commercials. This completes my CSI DVD collection but it's definitely not as good as some of the earlier seasons.,1494547200,,330,4.171875

8752213,1,B01C4HYTDU,It was for the wrong region. The region for a dvd should be more prominently placed.,1473552000,,84,4.3125
