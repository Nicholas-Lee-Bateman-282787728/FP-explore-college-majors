8262291,3,B0016GOLHU,"When I first started watching this movie, it seemed very familiar to me. And at first I analyzed that feeling to reflect that I have watched way too many Aamir Khan films in too short a time period. For example, I wondered did it seem familiar because the actor who played the newspaper editor in this movie resembled or was the same actor who played the banker in ""Ishq""?  Maybe.  Does the hitchhiking scene merely remind me of how Aamir and his brother traveled from town to town in ""Mela""?  Maybe.  Then I thought, is this movie actually a remake of the American movie classic His Gal Friday?  Is Aamir Khan wearing that otherwise inexplicable sailor's cap because Tony Curtis wore a similar cap as his role in ""Shell Oil"" in Some Like it Hot, which was Tony Curtis' celebration of Cary Grant, who was in His Gal Friday? Am I thinking about this way too much?  Yes, especially since it turned out Dil hai ke manta nahin was actually a remake of Clarke Gable's It Happened One Night.  Regarding the cap: I guess the costumer just had many left over sailor caps from the first scene where Pooja jumped ship, so Aamir got to wear one for the remainder of the film.

A good effort, fun to watch, as nice as Hum Hain Rahi Pyar ke, but overall not really very memorable, I think and I doubt I will give it a second watch.  But I liked it.  On a final note, it is interesting that I have now seen Aamir Khan of the 90s cast in remakes of classic Hollywood films in which the male leads were the likes of Marlon Brando (Ghulam which was On The Waterfront), Cary Grant (the aforementioned Hum Hain Rahi Pyar ke which was Houseboat and Mann which was An Affair to Remember) and now Clarke Gable (this, It Happened One Night).  Big names, big stars, big acting shoes to fill. For a young man in relatively low budget films,  commendable efforts.",1450051200,,1837,4.386430678466077
8262292,3,B0016GOLHU,"Story is spoilt rich girl (Pooja Bhatt) runs away to marry an egotistical movie star who is really after Dad's money. On the way to meet him she meets poor reporter (Aamir Khan) and they have adventures along the way till they fall in love. By this time Dad is Ok with her marrying the movie star but will she want that now...?
Aamir is excellent as always in this film and Pooja is an aptly cast spirited rich girl. However I found the movie a bit dated as films of this era tend to be a bit grainy and the hairstyles very 80s (though for them it was going into the 90s). So instead of looking Indian she had the long permed hair. Aamir is wearing a sailor's cap though there appears to be no nautical reference to this so it must have just been 'cool' (?) It is strange now to see normal bodies on actresses (even weighty ones!) as this was before Hindi movies were infected too by the anorexic supermodel stereotype.
The songs of that period don't do it for me either with the strings and high pitched female voices. So I found none of the songs memorable. Anupam Kher as the girls father has done some terrific stuff since but here he is doing a sort of slapstick rich man as they seemed to like then (and even now often!) However both Aamir and Anupam were nominated for awards for their roles in this movie at the time.
Look the plot is solid, Aamir is a delight to watch and I know not everyone has a problem with this era but can either overlook it more or feel a fondness for it. So ratings elsewhere on the Net for this 1991 movie are often around 7-8 out of 10. I think I'm more modern in what suits me so I found it a little more average. However I have been looking at what stars like Aamir did earlier in their careers and this performance has a lot to recommend it.",1240876800,,1780,4.16231884057971
8262293,5,B0016GOLHU,"Pooja Bhatt runs away from her home because she's in love with some stud. She runs into Amir Khan who's a news columnist. He's looking for a story and she's looking to reach her supposed love.

There are many funny scenes that'll kill you. Amir Khan is top notch like always. This is Pooja Bhatt's best film by a long shot. The music is pretty expressive but good overall. Anupam Kher who plays Bhatt's father is funny. We even has Jassi's dad as a funny detective. (Hehe)I liked most things about the film. This film is sadly overlooked. Anyhow,enjoy it if you haven't had the pleasure of watching it already. Buy this DVD.",1117843200,,624,4.522123893805309
