The best one I have ever seen was on Encore Western Channel... I would love to see that one available..",1420934400,2,245,4.3478260869565215

8568668,1,B00BHO11CE,"I recently purchased other titles from TGG direct and amazon.com such as ""the Mercenary/God's Gun"" and ""Death Rides A Horse/A Reason To Live, A Reason To Die"", both sets were of somewhat obscure spaghetti westerns, but the transfers were great looking. The picture was pristine and the image widescreen, so I was excited when I saw that the Terence Hill-Bud Spencer movie ""God Forgives...I Don't"" was being issued by the same good people. However, my enthusiasm turned to disappointment once I started to watch the disc, the picture quality was pretty poor and it was pan and scanned to boot. I will have to be more hesitant with any future releases coming from TGG direct, which saddens and frustrates me.",1364601600,16,706,4.891666666666667
