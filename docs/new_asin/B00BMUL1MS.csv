8571105,1,B00BMUL1MS,"Save your money and catch better biopics on YouTube. Bad film footage. Needed to see more concert performances than Al and Dennis shopping in London. Better yet, read one of their biographies!",1482710400,,192,5.03125
8571106,1,B00BMUL1MS,WORST DOCUMENTARY EVER. Do not waste your money on this. It's all horrible footage of various beach boys shopping for tea sets in England. WTF??? While the amateur looking on screen texts tells you about various concerts and live TV appearances (you'd think they would have shown that! Duh). The Beach Boys should sue. Go to Wikipedia and read about them there. It will be WAY more fun than watching this garbage.,1454457600,,413,4.75
8571107,2,B00BMUL1MS,But it just didn't seem like a full documentary.,1453161600,,48,4.444444444444445
8571108,1,B00BMUL1MS,Worst biopic ever!  Do not waste your time. You'll never get it back...,1440633600,,71,4.461538461538462
8571109,1,B00BMUL1MS,Not at all the story of the beach boys. This is more of a documentary on their middle years.,1437177600,,92,3.8947368421052633
8571110,1,B00BMUL1MS,Waste of time and money. It seems someone in England was experimenting with their computer movie maker software. Edits of previously available DVD''s are intermingled with screenshots of Text. Very low quality production.,1418947200,3,221,5.7272727272727275
8571111,1,B00BMUL1MS,"This is absolutely the worst documentary I've seen, ever! Mostly filler content from some home movies shot while the Beach Boys were on tour in England in the mid 60s, cut in with a few seconds here and there of interview footage that looks like it came from their ""An American Band"" movie. A big chunk of the film has nothing but title card descriptions of their careers layed over the badly shot home movie footage. I could not finish this.

Beach Boys fans should be offended...VERY offended. Then again, you won't be if you listen to me and DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!",1416096000,5,568,4.514563106796117
8571112,3,B00BMUL1MS,"Make that their second visit to London - the first was in late 1964. The footage in this DVD has been packaged and repackaged ad infinitum. Little, if anything, new here.",1364342400,11,170,4.516129032258065
