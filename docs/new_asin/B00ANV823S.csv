8554914,5,B00ANV823S,"Well, at least for the people in the DVD. The idea is to inhabit an underwater camp. The divers can go into the water and explore, then return to camp, eat, sleep and stay dry till their next foray. The advantage, of course, is that they needn't waste time decompressing. And they have a lovely view out the porthole as they watch fish and other sea creatures swim by.

I was expecting to see a hypothetical underwater town, covered by a transparent bubble and with views of coral reefs all around. Since the underwater camp was for research, I didn't see this. But what the movie showed made me wonder if these water towns could be in our future.",1391558400,,647,4.436974789915967
