7223111,5,B00YN6XAP4,"My Godson is a huge Power Ranger Super Megaforce fan, and he loved this movie. He was so excited to get it. The case it came in was nice too, it has a sleeve. Perfect birthday present, I plan to get a couple more for his Christmas stocking. Some people are saying that the power rangers has gone downhill since they were kids, but they have to remember that this is a kids show with fake martial arts. It has fighting, sparks, smoke, plot holes, space aliens, and characters that act very dramatic, and kids love it and that's all that's really important.",1443657600,5,555,4.398058252427185
7223112,1,B00YN6XAP4,"The show was garbage, the Toyline was garbage, 15 out of 20 storylines and scripts were garbage, the acting was garbage, the lack of explanations is still garbage, Jon Tznachor (or whatever his last name is) is garbage, the Legendary Battle itself is garbage, rushing the series was garbage, 20-22 episodes a season instead of 30+ or more is garbage and everything else about Super Megaforce is 100% garbage. This series needs a remake big time, even if it has to be a fan made remake, all 20 episodes of Super Megaforce needs to be remade with an added 20 episodes just to add some much needed flavor to this gumbo.",1442102400,6,616,4.558558558558558

7223114,1,B00YN6XAP4,"SuperMega Disappointment, all the build up for the war and the Rangers that were brought back are not even in the fight",1440633600,5,119,4.454545454545454
7223115,5,B00YN6XAP4,ok my brother likes them,1440547200,,24,4.0
7223116,1,B00YN6XAP4,Right from the beginning this was built up heavily for the Power Rangers 20th anniversary but in the end it was wasted potential and the cameos from the old rangers were alright but needed more screen time and other classic old ones.,1440374400,,233,4.571428571428571
7223117,4,B00YN6XAP4,good ending to the megaforce  series  fans will really like this must own,1439510400,2,73,4.538461538461538
7223118,5,B00YN6XAP4,"This is the last 2 episodes of Power Rangers Super Megaforce, which was the Legendary Battle. The final episode is the extended version which is roughly 10-minutes longer than the original TV broadcast and I certainly recommend the extended version and see the actual way that Emperor Mavro was defeated. This video itself is roughly 55 minutes and does complete the Super Megaforce collection.

Extras: There is a 10-minute ""Legacy"" documentary feature that takes clips from the Shout Factory Power Ranger interviews (mainly from the cast members that appeared in the Legendary Battle fight scene)

So yeah, the final DVD to a very good season, and as a long time fan from the beginning this is a fantastic finale that you and/or your child will love.",1439337600,4,752,4.9603174603174605

7223122,4,B00YN6XAP4,"Cheesy, but all of these are. The best part was the previous cast members bright back for a fight scene towards the end. Kids love it and at least the language is appropriate.  Only downside - keeping the 6 and 4 year old from recreating the fights.",1452470400,2,249,4.297872340425532

8718553,5,B00YN6XAP4,This is the last episode for Super Megaforce where every ranger from over the past 20 years comes to help the Megaforce rangers to stop the evil by vanquishing it.  This was what Troy saw when he first came to town but did not understand what he was dreaming about.  The battle has all the rangers fighting together with a few of the rangers showing their faces and talking to the Megaforce rangers.,1470873600,2,399,4.4520547945205475
