8102050,3,B000CSTKFQ,"Gunparade March is an anime based on a popular video game in Japan. The story involves young men and women in a military force bent on destroying the 'Genjyu', which from what I gathered was an alien life force capable of destroying humanity, with mecha-like machines. Sounds pretty typical anime fare because that's exactly what it is. When the pilots are not fighting we get to see their daily lives which are full of shenanigans and general silliness like most slice-of-life animes. And above all else we have the typical romantic tension and the people involved being extremely dense and stupid about it all.

I guess to summarize, it wasn't the worst anime I have ever seen, but neither was it very good. Doesn't leave a lasting impression and sometimes made me wonder why I was wasting my time finishing the series. If you're a fan of extremely typical anime fare, this might be a good choice for you. If you're looking for something deep, unique or just plain great, overlook this one.",1320451200,,992,4.734104046242774
