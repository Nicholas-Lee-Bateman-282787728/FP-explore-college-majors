3727044,4,B001O4C6L2,"Banished from her previous assignment because Headquarters considers her ineffective, Captain is sent out to a village at the end of the Earth (or at least the end of England).  She takes her niece (also a member of the Army) and soon after arriving, meet a ""social"" Senior who thinks the meetings and band practice is the perfect place to meet a man.  After the brief set-up of characters and why they are where they are, the fun really begins.

Stories unfold that leads our three ""Soldiers"" in and out of trouble with the local authorities, Army Headquarters and the new ""Soldiers for Christ.""

The situations themselves would keep an audience laughing, but with the Actors in the Series, you will roll with the humor.  A little slapstick added to a British Comedy is always magic and ""Hallelujah"" has it all.",1261267200,5,812,4.7304964539007095
3727045,5,B001O4C6L2,"Taking a chance on buying this show with out seeing a single episode and hope it will be enjoyably a good show. Now I can say I'm glad a purchase this set. Very straight forward humor and mishaps as these 3 wonderful well established Actresses that I never seen before have a great acting talent to make this worthy of your money. As Fans of British comedy's like Keeping Up Appearances and Vicar of Diddly. I think you would enjoy this show.

 The Run down of this show Base on these lady's going out as part of the Salvation Army to recruit and help a small town among other things with things do not always turn out the way they plan or unexpectedly gone wrong. The Captain play by( Thora Hird )has a Hellfire and Brimstone approach that no one is responding to anymore so has to come up with different ways. Her two recruits play by ( Patsy Rowlands ) and ( Rosemund Greenwood ) do things that the Capt is not approved of at times also haven't lost their inner fire for a male companion as for the Capt is more like a fuddy-duddy.

 The only draw back I have is This not the complete set. I look the show up on Internet Movie Data base and their is actually 3 seasons not 2. This set starts from season 2. But none the less this is a good buy. Hopefully they will release the 1st season is some time. As for myself i would like to have.  Hopefully that will not keep potential buyers from this lovely show.

R.I.P to these lovely Actresses",1260921600,5,1443,4.2290909090909095

3727047,4,B001O4C6L2,"Delightful series for Dame Thora Hird.  Very different from her character in Last of the Summer Wine, but somehow more of the Thora as she lived life.",1244764800,6,150,4.555555555555555
3727048,5,B001O4C6L2,"As a uniformed bandsman (Tustin Ranch Salvation Army Band, Southern California) and member of The Salvation Army, I found ""Hallelujah!"" Season One delightful and very funny. The jokes are fast, thus I laughed more during the second and third viewings than the first. Captain Ridley's character of caring for the lost and her human frailties lends credibility to her character which makes her all the more likable. Captain Ridley's can do attitude and her one on One faith and relationship with The One is in essence what attracted me, after being introduced through Salvation Army Band music, to The Army and it is that essence keeps me there. Though Captain Ridley is so called misguided, the words of another reviewer, she does have success when dealing with those in need. The script is excellent. Just thinking about the show makes me laugh.  The set's attention to detail is superb. ""Hallelujah!"" embodies the words of Meredith Wilson's Banners and Bonnets, ""Could you love the unloved, never reckoning the cost, Giving them comfort and care? Could you seek the unloved, in the legion of the lost, Sharing their grief and despair? That's the creed of an Army, a God fearing Army, With banners and bonnets they come. Yes, to love the unloved in the spirit of the Lord, Marching with trumpet [cornet] and drum....""",1243209600,19,1317,4.9324324324324325
3727049,5,B001O4C6L2,"It is hard to say which part is funnier; the eccentric cast, soul-winning gone awry, or money contribution collection techniques dreamed up by the odd lot of this 3-woman Salvation Army corp. This British television series from 1983-83 takes the hilarious, and somewhat irreverent, look at the Salvation Army from the inside.  Through 15 episodes, Captain Emily Ridley (Thora Hird) steamrolls her misguided way through her administration of a soul-seeking band and do-gooders.  Her less than successful, but well intentioned, plans and activities keep the episodes hopping.

She is sent to Brigthorpe, a small Yorkshire town as a form of the Salvation Army (aka Sally Ann) plan to mothball the Captain and her failures. She takes with her a niece and SA colleague, Sister Alice Meredith (Patsy Rolands) who tries to put a better light on the mistakes of the Captain, also her Auntie.  Opening in a defunct Bingo parlor, they first convert the aged Dorothy Smith (Rosamund Greenwood-a lovable grandma-type much like Granny of the Beverly Hill Billies). This local white-headed gal is willing to join any organization that might introduce her to a man. She's not dead yet.

Away the 3 go, like silly old female Musketeer Christian Soldiers, or 3 tract-toting Senior Stooges.  Alice and Dorothy follow Capt. Emily like she is the tambourine pied piper. Even when they feel less than confident in the Captain's plan.

Dorothy proved to be such a delight, she nearly upstaged the other 2 stars. The one negative to this series: at the beginning of the second DVD and it's 8 episodes from 1984, Dorothy is missing. The Capt. and Alice have been moved on to an even more remote position in the Blackwick Citadel on Mill Street.  Capt. Ridley still refuses retirement. Regional HQ send her to Blackwick because they have all but given up on that failing location with its clientele of the outrageous and severely dysfunctional. Can the Captain and Songster Alice turn it around? Win souls? Raise $? Will retirement finally be forced upon Emily?

Alice converts the first Blackwick soul, Benjamin (David Daker), a local derelict that turns to the SA couple because Alice reminds him of his former best friend, a dog. He joins the soul-seeking program, replacing Sister Smith, and fills those pretty big, black, shoes quite well.

The final ""Christmas Special"" episode is worth half the collection's cost. It is an outrageously funny abomination of the Dickens' ""Christmas Carol"" story of ""Bob Scratchett"" and his ""Tiny Tom"" from ""Sewer Street.""  What a jollification for ending the 2-year series.

There is a serious bonus explaining the history of the Salvation Army.

No subtitles available, but the reverse on your remote works to get the occasional needed phrase repeated. That's important sometimes, because some of the verbal gags are so quick, you'll need a rerun, so you can laugh a second time.  Cleaver use of scripture memorization by the lady Captain who also has the habit of looking heavenward when talking with the boss--God. Or asking forgiveness for what she just did or said.

You will enjoy some of the picturesque shots in small-town England.

This is not dry but goofier British comedy. Perhaps it's what Red Green would be like if he was an old spinster heading up a Salvation Army group rather than a loony lodge.",1241827200,14,3327,4.989150090415913

3727065,5,B001O4C6L2,"I was tempted to rate this collection on the low side, due to rather poor visual and audio quality of the two-disc set.  It is rather dark in color, has NO subtitles or closed-captions, and the only supplements are a few GOOD trailers for other British comedy series (and they precede the main content of ""Hallelujah"" on both discs), plus a short, one-page written history of the Salvation Army that can be accessed on the main menu of disc #1.  However, the series itself is so-o-o dearly and beautifully played by the main actors (Thora Hird and Patsy Rowlands) that it overrules the less-than-stellar technical aspects of the set to an extent that, IMO, makes the series rate highly!!

If you have the option to set viewing controls on an up-scaling blu-ray player to the brightest setting, you can see everything adequately, and if you set the volume on an audio system at a rather high level, you can hear the deliberate and clear articulation of most all the really splendid actors.  The dialogue should not be too difficult to understand, even if it is in a strong English brogue!

Thora Hird plays her role with qualities that only she can bring to it, as one of the dearest, most honest, genuinely respectful and caring persons you'd ever want to meet!  The situations she finds herself in as captain of a Salvation Army citadel are skillfully and artfully hilarious.  One example, near the end of the second disc, she has, of all things, been charged with running a kind of ""house of ill-repute!"", which is, of course, just a HUGE (and funny!) misunderstanding!

Of special note, early on disc #2 (I think it was episode #2 or #3 on disc #2) there is an especially endearing section, when an impoverished (and homeless?) older lady reveals a beautiful voice as she sings a touchingly sentimental, old, old love song.  It might bring a tear to your eyes...it did to mine!

All in all, a WONDERFUL comedy series!  Highly recommended!",1345334400,4,1941,4.71301775147929

3727067,5,B001O4C6L2,"This is another great series with Thora Hird. In this series, she is a feisty salvation army worker, who was told she should retire.

3727068,5,B001O4C6L2,"This comedy series, with affectionate, not mocking, humor about a Salvation Army captain and her adventures in two appointments in England was very enjoyable.

I would love to find out about them, and secure them for my collection.

3727069,5,B001O4C6L2,"Whilst I may be biased because I absolutely ADORE Thora Hird and Patsy Rowlands, it has to be said that this is one the the funniest and most gentle comedies made in YEARS!.  As  a Brit myself and a Northerner by roots I really understand both the dialect and the scenario of northern humour, but even without this benefit it is impossible not to find this inoffensive, extremely funny series anything else.

Based on centrally just the 3 characters, Captain Emily, and her 2 recruits with additional, assorted extras in different episodes, it is the timing, the script and the actual casting of those central characters which makes this so special.  Made in the early 80's and centred solely around the Salvation Army and Captain Emily's attempts to save the wicked it is quite simply hilarious and the northern setting with the brass band and the lovely scenery of Yorkshire just makes it all the more so.

I had to buy this from the USA because its deleted in the UK and no longer available.  Classic comedy removed in favour of trash and offensive ""comedians"".  Well keep up the good work Amazon.com and you USA citizens because we need you to need this kind of humour so we can remove all the other ""humour"" purchases available which are anything but.  Also recommend ""In Loving Memory"" another Thora Hird Classic.  Check that one out too.  10 out of 10.",1272758400,15,1359,4.6722689075630255

8329433,3,B001O4C6L2,"Two seasons of only 15 episodes comprise Hallelujah!  This comedy is decidedly old fashioned to the point of being quaint especially considering it appeared in 1983-84.  One would almost think it was a product of the 60s.  The first series is marginally better than the second thanks to Rosamund Greenwood as Sister Dorothy.  They replaced her with a new recruit (David Daker) in the second series.  It was not a marked improvement.  The plot involves Captain Emily Ridley (Dame Thora Hird) a disgruntled member of the Salvation Army who has worked for 42 years without the promotion only she thinks she deserves.  She is over zealous, suspicious, and quick to call a sinner to correction for things shes imagined theyve done.  The humor is sporadic.
