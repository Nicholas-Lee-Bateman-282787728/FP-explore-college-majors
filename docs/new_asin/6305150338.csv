Hadley is handsome and great in action scenes, especially the many swordfights required here. His foppish Don Diego, arrayed in lace and frills and speaking in girly outbursts, is an intentional contrast to Zorro's manly black outfit and mask. This, to keep others from guessing the Don's crimefighting alter-ego.
.

In REPUBLIC's ""Fighting Legion,"" he and his men battle Don Del Oro, an enemy hidden beneath an outlandish metallic disguise, who uses loyal Yaqui Indians in his quest to destroy the Mexican Republic and become that country's ruler. Every plot Del Oro puts into motion is foiled by Zorro and eventually we learn the villain's actual identity.

My sole criticism of this well-done cliffhanger is one of munitions. It's 1824, yet in battle scenes riflemen never stop to ramrod charges and projectiles into their weapons, also twin-barreled pistoles seem to have more than two shots in them. The sustained volleys fired by galloping horsemen are impossible without frequent reloading.

OK, it's only a movie serial, and as such, ZORRO'S FIGHTING LEGION is an excellent one. Very much recommended.

Budget big enough to look sensational and lens in brightly lit scenes that made each frame crisp and easy to follow. Choose any episode,sit back and enjoy!",1104451200,,331,4.892857142857143
8175543,3,6305150338,"Just finished watching this version of Zorro.  It's pretty good and Reed Hadley does a commendable job as Don Diego.  He has the fopish down real good. But he lacks the macho touch of Zorro.  He's no Tyrone Power who was the very best of all the Zorros. Of course you can't forget Guy Williams who also did a great job as the cape crusader. But I tell you, I love watching any movie with Zorro.",989625600,,394,4.157894736842105
