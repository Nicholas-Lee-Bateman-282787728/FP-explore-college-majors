8720127,4,B00ZGJ86DS,"I liked this movie but I must say that I liked Virtuous a bit better.  Virtuous had more story to it, in my opinion, but Uncommon is good too...  very nice transformation scene in this movie, too; those are always heart-warming.",1521072000,,228,4.536585365853658

8720132,4,B00ZGJ86DS,"Sadly, the film has a predictable plot, detail gaps that had us backtracking for info not included, and the presence of the overhead  boom and microphone in several scenes.  Positively, the story was an enjoyable family film with good acting, info on the legal precident for Christian activies and freedom of speech in public schools,  and a nice musical finale.  So good to see indepedent Chritian films, but the boom and mic should have been deleted during editing.",1451260800,2,467,4.948717948717949

8720134,5,B00ZGJ86DS,"Released on 1 Septembre 2015 Uncommon is definitively the sort of movie reminding you that we too often take the path of least resistance. Why else have we failed to oppose a school system where God has no place?

When do we take a stand for what we believe into? When do we fight back and really show our children what can be achieved when we 'love one another as He loves us'?
The story behind this movie is not the sort that will break the box offices by all means but you will remember and appreciate the earnest acting and familiar faces. The heartening message behind UNCOMMON will inspire anyone who believe in peace.  Our world has turned a blind eye on violence and bullying too often, particularly in our schools. Let's share this movie with any young adult to show them it is 'cool' to make a difference and fight for what is right!.
