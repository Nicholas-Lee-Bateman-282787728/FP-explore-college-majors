This movie has good editing since it is a compilation of  the four Armitage series. If you want more story detail get the series,  especially since the series and the movie have two different endings.",926553600,,364,4.323529411764706
716889,1,6303853218,"I like anime, I think.  Quite a bit.  And this, I have to say, was just about the worst one I've ever seen.  The story itself is fairly ludicrous, with more than a bit of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (that's Blade  Runner to you uncultured savages) influence, but much worse.  The best bits  are the voice acting and the script, however.  Ordinarily I can't stand  dubbed anime, but here the dubbing really helped, taking a film that would  ordinarily just have been insipid and boring, and turning it into a film  that was utterly, if unintentionally, hilarious.  The acting was  bad...very, very bad--not that the ""actors"" exactly had the best  material to work with.  I'm utterly astounded by all the high ratings.  Apparently, this is the only anime many people have seen.  Priceless, in a  manner of speaking.",925689600,3,822,4.757142857142857

The story of a young robot who has the same feelings and reactions as a human  has been done before but not this well!!!!  Armitage combines a story with  love,adventure, and its greatest thing action!  Everyone who has seen  anime, this anime is a must own.  You'll want to watch it again and again  because of its excellent story and the characters that you come to know as  is they were real.

716983,5,6303853218,One of the better scifi anime involving cyber punk shenanigans. Great package and quality! Highly reccomended for fans of Ghost in the Shell or Bubble Gum Crisis,1366588800,,161,5.0
716984,4,6303853218,"In the far future on Mars, there lives 3 different beings such as human beings, seconds which are robots and of course thirds which are very human-like cyborgs with emotions and genetic structures like humans. Police officer Ross Sylibus (Voiced by Keither Sutherland) hates thirds after seeing his girlfriend killed by one yet has a new partner named Naomi Armitage (Voice by Elizabeth Berkley) who is secretly a Third, the government wants to eliminate the Thirds and cover up the evidence.

A complex, well made and action packed cerebral Sci-fi action thriller in the tradition of ""Akira"", ""Ghost in The Shell"", Philip K. Dick and even ""Blade Runner"" as it's one of those intelligent anime films that also packs some action in. The film like ""Blade Runner"" or GITS provides philosphy with great animation and stunning action sequences, there is brief nudity but not all bad as this is a very well animated and enjoyable anime that was edited from an OAV to be a big screen movie in 1997 featuring 2 well known celebrities like Sutherland and Berkley (Yes the Showgirls and Saved by The Bell star) but despite being inferior to GITS it's worth watching and the sequel is even better.

This DVD contains great remastering and extras like trailer and production notes, nothing worthwhile on extras plus no Japanese language with subtitles.",1323561600,,1340,4.9511111111111115

716987,3,6303853218,"Coming out a year before the Ghost In The Shell movie, this was one of the quintessential cyberpunk anime movies. Originally, Armitage III(not the ""third"" in a series, BTW)was a 4-episode OVA which blended Total Recall and Blade Runner. It was later put into this compliation movie, Poly-Matrix, which was redubbed with Elizabeth Berkley and Kiefer Sutherland cast as the main characters.

Taking place in the mid-21st Century, mankind has begun populating Mars. Ross Syllibus is a cop from Earth who transfers to the Martian police, but on the flight in, a female country singer is killed. The scantily-clad policewoman, Naomi Armitage, trails the killers in the terminal and abruptly meets Ross, although the main killer, Rene D'anclaude, escapes. The singer is revealed to actually be an android, first confused with one of the types called the ""seconds"", but she is really a ""third"" which is a female android totally identical to humans, and capable of giving birth. Armitage and Ross are assigned with bringing in D'anclaude. They track him down, however, Armitage is shown for being a third herself, and goes missing after D'anclaude arrest. More thirds keep getting killed, so Ross continues to search for their killer, and comes across Armitage along with a supposed male third. Another D'anclaude then attacks them, who it turns out is a second. Armitage and Ross then raid a hospital the original D'anclaude is in, and discover the creator of the thirds(and Armitage's father), Dr. Asakura, is lying in a compound in the Martian desert. They find him there along with a reprogrammed D'anclaude second. While there, Armitage and Ross admit their true feelings for each other, only to have to take on the Earth army the next day who bomb the compound. The two of them survive, and Armitage somehow realizes that she's now pregnant.

This compilation movie wasn't bad, as compared to some other ones like the Mobile Suit Gundam trilogy, and Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz. However, its a step above some of the shameless ""movies"" that were released in America that were actually just OVA episodes strung together in a single movie like Sonic The Hedgehog or Tekken. The original Armitage III OVA series is probably a better representation of the anime than Poly-Matrix, not to mention the dub is better too. It has the same voice actors in each one, aside from Berkley performing flatly as Armitage, and Sutherland as Syllibus sounding like he didn't really care about what he was doing. As a movie, there were some scenes left out from the OVA for time, even though there was an original opening and closing to it. You'll getta better feel for the series over the film though. It's also worth checking out the sequal movie, Armitage III: Dual-Matrix which was a fair conclusion to it.",1263254400,,2788,4.955128205128205
716988,5,6303853218,I am very pleased with the product. The seller sold it to me and within a week I received the item. Fabulous seller!,1256256000,,116,4.086956521739131
716989,5,6303853218,"Arimtage III is a truly great anime OVA. Sadly it came out about the same time as the original GHOST IN THE SHELL, and was overlooked for the overrated Ghost in the Shell movie. The story is far better, truly delving into whether machines are alive or not and could they be considered human, along with many other questions. Can they fall in love, or even have children. Then there are the two main characters, Naomi Armitage and Ross Sylibus. They add depth and bring life to the story. The action is great keeping you watching even in the quiet times of the anime. The animation isn't as great as it was after all it's been 13 years since it first came out, but it still holds up today. I would highly recommend this anime over any of the Ghost in the Shell anime",1240704000,,765,4.319444444444445
716990,3,6303853218,"Whilst I loved the movie when it first came out I was hoping the 'Signature Series' would rectify the problems of the VHS tape. Luckily there's 2 upsides, the sound has been upgraded to 5.1 Dolby and the picture has been remastered. Unfortunately the picture suffers from image stabilisation (it moves up & down a little bit during some scenes but that could be because of the original source) and there's still a fair bit of grain but the colours are polished

This DVD claims it has a widescreen presentation but its not enhanced for widescreen TVs - it is in fact a 16:9 ratio inside of a 4:3 so if you have a widescreen tv like myself, you're going to have black borders on all sides and a tiny picture in the middle! Also this movie has been cropped to make it look cinematic (as I discovered when I ordered it along with the OVA DVD) so you're missing literally half of the animation cells.

Negativities aside its still a good movie, its just very unfortunate that its one main problem with the original Poly Matrix DVD has not been fixed and as a result the whole movie suffers. I'd recommend buying the OVA though, the picture displayed is bigger, the english dub may be different but there's also a japanese audio option & an extended 50min of additional footage that was taken out from the movie",1220313600,,1306,4.483193277310924
716991,5,6303853218,"I was a teen the first time I saw this movie and it was probably the first anime I ever saw so when I saw it on Amazon I had to buy it.  This is a classic anime movie that is well wroth seeing.

The animation is at times a little bit shaky but the fight scenes are top notch.  And you can really feel Armitage's struggle, feeling and wanting to be human but not sure if she really is.  Not sure if her emotions and feeling are real or if the is just a doll made to think they are.

Cheers, BB",1208995200,,492,3.737864077669903
717032,4,6303853218,"This was the first Anime i consciously watched knowing that the film came from Japan and not America. To say the least, Armitage III: Polymatrix deserves its place in Geneon's(Pioneer) Signature Series. Its beautifully Animated, the voice acting is top notch, and the film has a strong resonance with fans, and serves as a textbook example of the cyberpunk genre. Unfortunately, the film is a cut-down version of the OVA. This generally is not a problem, but Pioneer cut out several crucial scenes that are central to the continuity of the film. Most obvious is a scene of Lt. Randolph expressing concern of the misconduct of Dect. Syllabus. With out the scene of Ross breaking into a penthouse to interrogate a witness, who is the blown up by the villainous D'ne Claude, the whole scene with Randolph makes little sense, nor do several comments about Ross becoming a ""bad guy cop"" later in the film.

Were it not for these flaws, this film would easily get all 5 stars, but as it stands, the onlything the film holds over the OVA is the supurb english dub. a must for fans, and a great starting point for those interested in anime",1206316800,,1131,4.655
717033,1,6303853218,"I am at a loss for words right at this moment. How can anyone sane possibly give this movie anything higher than one star? While watching this...thing... I quickly felt a change take over me. Anger cursed through my body and I started foaming at the mouth. My brain began melting from the sheer stupidity of this film, and then I had a heart attack and died a painful death. Even the thought that anybody could like this moronic trash was enough to make me laugh, but then I go on Amazon and see people calling it ""thought provoking"" and the ""best anime ever."" WHAT? I could not believe what I was reading, so now I am here to tell the truth about possibly the WORST anime ever made.

The movie starts out well enough with the murder of the world last country music star but takes a dramatic turn for the worse when the ""cop"" that tries to arrest the murderer turns out to be a 16 year old girl who looks like she got her uniform from Hot Topic and Victoria Secret. She has a heart belt buckle on her cop uniform, please. The ""cop"" whips out a bright red gun (I'm surprised there weren't any flower stickers on it) and starts shooting in a crowded airport. As this is going on our main character, a cop from earth who is your stereotypical buff guy with a sensitive spot just sits there and watches. Some cop he is.

From there on the story just gets worse and worse. Turns out that Mars is going through some sort of crises. Robots are taking people jobs away a, and now a bunch of out of work bums are roaming the streets trying to kill robots. turns out though that Armatige, out half naked 16 year old Victoria Secret wearing cop is really (shock shock) A ROBOT. Yeah, I know, I didn't see it coming either.

This film tries to hard to be something its not. It want to be Ghost in a Shell with a deep philosophy hidden underneath its skin but end of being nothing more that a cheap imitation. They try to play off Armatige as a real person, but lets face it people, she IS A MACHINE!!! It's not like in Ghost in a Shell where the Major was born human but given a cyborg body to better fight crime, Armatige never WAS human. She is 100% pure robot. Her emotions are artificial, her brain is an AI, she is nothing more that a very high tech toaster, and yet she is treated as if she were really human.

Therefore, it is EXTREMLY disgusting when the male lead actually slept with her. First off, even if you want to think of her as human, she's still only about 16 years old, and he's what? 30? This makes him a pervert regardless. But the idea of sleeping with a robot is just too stupid to comprehend. It's the equivalent of Sara Conner sleeping with the terminator. Disgusting. I don't care how human she seems, I don't care how much she thinks she's human, she is NOT HUMAN!!!

There are so many great anime out there that you can skip this one and not miss it. If you want a philosophical movie about cyborgs, see Ghost in a Shell. If you want sci fi action that takes place on different worlds, see Venus Wars or Cowboy Bebop. If you want cyber punk, see Serial Experiments Lain. If, however, you want to commit suicide, then this may just be the movie for you. However, be prepared for a painful death. After all, rabies hurts man.

717034,2,6303853218,"Polymatrix is a movie version of the OVA.  While it's fun to look at, there is too much taken out of the original series.  Yes, it still makes sense for the most part, but the relationship building between Naomi and Ross is not as strong, Jean Claude's motives don't seem to make as much sense, and the true bitterness Ross feels about robots isn't as telling in this film.

My biggest grlpe is the voice actors.  Elizabeth Berkeley and Keifer Sutherland give the most deadpan and lifeless performances that it really sucks the magic out of the characters.

The OVA is far superior to this release.",1182384000,,598,4.60377358490566
717035,5,6303853218,"I loved this movie. Made it on the top Anime/OVA and overall fav. movies.

As a Elizabeth Berkley fan, I was pleased with her work in this film. Not her best, but it worked well. I sometime though Jess from Saved by the Bell once in a while which in my view is not to bad.

The movie was great though, great plot, music, visuals, character interation/reactions, it was all good. It filled many genres.",1118880000,,401,4.333333333333333
717036,2,6303853218,"There are tons of great reviews for this movie.  That's understandable if none of them have seen the original OAV series this came from.  See, back in 1994-1995, a 4-part OAV series called ""Armitage III"" came out in Japan.  ""Poly-Matrix"" takes that 140-minute series and hacks it down to ~90-minutes. Thus this 1997 dub-title is born.  So a lot of the story gets cut and things aren't nearly as good as the original.  If you've seen the original, you'll be annoyed at all of the cuts and poor edit choices.
As to the dub cast (there is no Japanese cast on a dub-title as they simply re-edit an original Japanese product for American consumption), having big stars lend their voices makes it a better dub than a lot of anime titles/series.  But it doesn't make up for the complete and utter hack job the series was given to form this movie.
Bottom line: If you thought this was good, the OAV is tons better.  If you haven't seen this, get the OAV instead.",1068768000,11,954,4.479768786127168
717037,5,6303853218,"I've been hooked on Naomi Armitage ever since I saw Poly-Matrix on Sci-Fi a few years ago. I quickly went out and bought the movie. The story is excellent, including the best anime soundtrack ever created. It is very easy to become attached to Armitage as you watch the movie, and you begin to feel for her. Kudos to Hyroyuki Ochi on this film. If you like anime, or even if you don't know much about it, see this movie, I guarantee you will love it! With the realease of the sequel, Armitage: Dual Matrix, I went nuts. Of course I didn't buy the double set, but I grabbed the Lunchbox set instead, since I have the original version of the McFarlane figure. Let me not that Poly-Matrix started as a 4-part series, and was broken down to make the movie. I recommend buying the 4 part series as well, that way you'll get the hour missing from Poly-Matrix. I fell in love with Armitage III, and you will too!",1026864000,5,905,4.329411764705882

The music is phenomenal, the action is great and perfectly distributed through the plot, and the plot is great if you can follow the last 10 minutes (just watch it two or three times tops and you will definitely have it).  All this + Naomi Armitage is hot + Cool costumes = A perfect formula.

The story follows an earth cop named Ross who is transferred to Mars where he is partnered with an enigmatic police woman named Armitage.

Kiefer Sutherland, a phenomenal actor, does very well for his first (and only) anime voice work. He's not as ranged as he is when he's live acting, but he is still solid. Armitage makes the viewer chase the answers like the characters, and ties them together into a great summation about prejudice, hatred, emotion, love, and purpose.

But, the series was hacked up and assembled into this shambles of a movie featuring dire voice-overs by Kiether Sutherland (who is a good actor) and Elizabeth Berkley (who is not). Neither actor or actress seemed to give much of an effort and the original series, with it's increased length and full scenes and low-key voice actors give Armitage a much better run.

The only problem I have is with the dvd itself, in that it lacks a Japanese audio track. And I don't mean on the DVD. I mean COMPLETELY. This movie is just a mishmash of several larger straight to video releases. The English track is the only one to ever exist. I just can't stand Elizabeth Berkley. She can't voice-act. ... The supporting characters are just plain horrible. Characters being brutally murdered sound more like they're being pestered by a small child.
A better translation in the subtitles would be also be nice; semi-complex plots seem to be explained better in original Japanese (I assume the original OAV's were in Japanese) as they need to change the words around a bit to fit the movements of the character's mouth in English.

This movie delivers in spades.  Sure some parts seem hoaky.  But so what, every great film has to have it's fumble here and there.  I just hope Armitage and Ross live the life they always dreamed of living, and I hope they find that what makes us human goes beyond flesh and blood.

Armitage, a third herself, is a bounty hunter after a psycho bent on murdering the thirds. So begins the struggle against human and third, and of course, there's the classic and generic  ""I wonder what it's like to be human...."" internal struggle. The story starts off promisingly, but it eventually lags to the point where I was left uninterested as to what would happen next. It tends to jump around a bit, though this movie supposedly smoothens out the gaps from the OAV series. The dubbing is above average though, as it seems there were some high-profile talents hired for the voice-overs. It's surprisingly lacking in action and doesn't have much of a soundtrack to intensify anything.

The setup is like that of Kite, but the plot is on par with Blade Runner. Armitage is your teenage cop who wear skimpy outfits and is a pretty bad girl. The story begins on Mars. After Ross arrives at the airport, Armitage shows up to arrest a mad man. After taking out his men, Armitage shoots him and his briefcase opens to reveal a dead body of a famous singer. After Armitage tries to take out the mad man, Armitage and Ross discover that she was a Third. Third's are the third line of androids produced by a speical man. There are also Seconds. Seconds are mad men who wish to kill the thirds. Through this movie, Armitage helps kill the Seconds and also meet a few thirds. Some nice scenes are when Ross and Armitage duke it out with a Second in a sewer, the raid of the hospital and the final epic battle where Ross and Armitage duke it out with an entire army with ARmitage packing some wings. Armitage soon meets her father and even meets the new models called Fourths. The movie seems to boast well from the dubbing by famous voice actors of Elizabeth Berkley and Keifer Sutherland.

717169,4,6303853218,"I can by no means consider myself a pro at rating animes, as Ihaven't seen many. ...the story on the back (which was small font and kinda hard to read) sounded good.
The animation itself is rather choppy, not as smooth as many of the other animes out there. Even most Saturday morning cartoons have thinner lines and just all around better animation. The voice acting was okay, not the greatest but not horrible either; I wish the lead male had had more animation (no pun intended) to his voice, but it wasn't that bad.
If you can get past that, though, there's a great storyline here. I watched it a second time, once I got used to the animation, and still really liked the story itself after that. It's about a cop named Armitage and her new partner Ross. Someone named Rene is going around killing ""Thirds"" and broadcasting over the airways that these 'people' aren't real humans but robots masquerading as human. This of course causes an uproar, and we come to learn that Armitage is a Third herself. After that, the storyline revolves around finding out just what a Third is, why they were created, who created them, and why someone is trying to wipe them off the surface of Mars.
Great storyline, okay voice acting, nice animation. It's not the snazziest thing on the market, but I'm glad I bought it. :)",979776000,,1310,4.555084745762712

717227,3,6303853218,"I only gave Armitage 3 stars as it does not come close to it's incredible potential. It is a good retelling of Bladerunner from the replicant/robot perspective. Yet it lacks so much. The character design was unusual for anime as it tries to make human features as real and imperfect as possible to contrast the artificially perfect beauty of the robots. Yet the animation and art seemed rushed and almost shoddy. The ""slide show"" jogging scene is a good example. The plot was deep and complex but was grossly undeveloped. Jumping from scene to scene without lead-ins or connections made the movie disjointed. The relationships that are so pivotal to the movie appear out of nowhere. Kiefer's dubbing is a little stilted. He pulls off the strong, but silent detective role perfectly, but when emotion is called for he can't make it work. Elizabeth Berkley's performance was really good, though. Most of my complaints can be blamed on editing. My first thought when the movie finished was that it should have been at least 10 minutes longer in order to fully develop the plot and characters. Before writing this I read a few of the reviews below and now it all makes sense. It turns out that this movie should have been twice as long since it was first a full series which was edited down to a mere 90 minutes. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, but I see so much that could be improved. If you enjoy anime definitely buy this as it is better than 80% of what is available. I only gave it 3 stars, but I am really picky. The DVD itself is very well put together. The menus are quite good. There are some extras, but not a lot. The ""jump to scene"" menu is a real treat as it has 10 separate screens, each of which has a different song from the soundtrack.

Since then I have purchased the original 4-volume series (30 minutes each, except for volume 1, which is 50 minutes).  After watching the original four volumes, I can say without hesitation that they are far superior to the condensed and redubbed motion picture version.

717229,2,6303853218,"I rented this DVD expecting a typical anime movie. What I got was a wonderfully animated film -with no plot whatsoever!  The reason that I even sat through the entire thing was because the Japanese AND English voice acting was good, a rarity for anime. Don't get me wrong, the animation is top-notch, and the DVD has crystal clarity. However, there is one thing that absolutely shoots this movie into the toilet. Armitage III was originally a series of 4 original animation videos (OAVs), all of which added up to about 2 hours 20 minutes of animation. Well, on the DVD there is only 1 hour 30 minutes worth of animation. That's nearly an hour that was hacked off! This does not do wonders for the storyline, which resembles a movie that has been spliced and re-spliced about 20 different times with incongruous scenes. In fact, the movie's only saving grace is the fact that some of the good elements from the OAVs, such as the voice acting and animation, are still present.
Do yourself a favor. Do not, under any circumstances, buy this DVD! It does the OAV series, which is absolutely wonderful, no justice at all. Get the original series as it was meant to be seen, and I guarantee you will be much happier. I am, because I now own all 4 OAVs and have never again set my eyes on the Poly-Matrix ""movie"".

A3 was one of  my first anime, when I caught it on television.  I thought it was good  then, but didn't watch more anime because of it's lack of availability and  my lack of further exposure.
Vivid animation.  Great action.  Strong  emotions.  Famous, good voice actors (may be easier convince non-anime  friends to watch).  [Side note, I really liked Keifer Sutetherland in  ""Dark City""]
After seeing it again, I must say there are strong  resembelences to Bladerunner's vision of the future.  Human-like, thinking  and feeling androids are being systemically persecuted and assasinated.  A  human cop who's partner had been killed by an android is assigned to  investigate, with his new partner, Armitage. She is very strong willed and  emotional, but is also revealed to be an android.  I really felt for  Armitage, who is a good person, when she suffers an emotional breakdown  because she thinks she is a worthless because she is an artifical  life.

Elizebeth Berkley really gives life to Armitage's  character. Keifer Sutherland could have been a little less somber, but it  seemed to fit his character fine. i also thought that the soundtrack was  very interesting, because i'm a big fan of electronic music. also the  action sequences were done fairly well. especially the part where Armitage  and Ross were storming the hospital.
now, the bad: some of the directing  doesn't make any sense. the bad guy periodically appears out of nowhere  without reason or explination. not to mention the end. it absolutely  baffled me. is there some hidden meaning, what? the plot is a little weak  in places. i never really fully understood the relationship between  D'Aneclaude and the Thirds. also the face-off between Armitage and Rene in  the hospital could have been done better.
