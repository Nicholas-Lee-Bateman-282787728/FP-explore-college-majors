5793226,4,B00DDT0J88,"This is a good compilation that looks critically at WWII battles (Anzio) and mission types (Allied bombing of Germany).  The War Lover has Steve McQueen as a hotshot bomber pilot at odds with his co-pilot played by Robert Wagner.  The bomber mission footage seems quite authentic, but serves as backdrop for McQueen's war-infatuated personality and how it plays with his crew and commanders.  Hellcats is about submariners in the Pacific theater, and the battle footage generally seems right (AFAIK!), but the plot-- emphasizing the tough decisions of command faced by a captain (Ronald Reagan) and his subordinate commander's eventual accession through embracing these responsibilities-- is weakly wrought by the actors and actresses.  Anzio stars Robert Mitchum as a battle-toughened press correspondent who witnesses the poor initial U.S. leadership of the mission to take Rome from the south by General Leslie.  The movie works to hide this criticism of that campaign by emphasizing Mitchum's philosophical aversion to war's processes versus his addiction to combat 'high,' as reflected also in the Peter Falk character.  I've yet to watch Night of the Generals.",1482624000,,1166,5.45

5793229,3,B00DDT0J88,"Anzio good except for the audio (occasionally) - and despite ""English Closed Captions Available"" on the main title there were none to be found.  The historical treatment of the epic mishandling agreed with other accounts, so - assuming the DVD's remaining 3 war pics have similar qualities - I'll leave it with 3 stars.",1480723200,,319,4.907407407407407

5793252,4,B00DDT0J88,"The Night of the Generals is a very good movie, not so much a war movie but it was set during WW2.  The War Lover and Anzio are good war movies, worth a watch maybe once or twice a year.  Hellcats of the Navy is of a different sort, a much more primitive movie.  It is a good story but special effects are primitive at best, and the sets are just so so.  But it is the only movie that Ronald Reagan appeared in with Nancy Reagan, and for that it is worth owning I guess.
 Overall this collection is a good value, well worth the money for sure.",1453161600,3,543,3.944954128440367
5793253,5,B00DDT0J88,Received item timely and as described.  Purchased this dvd specifically for THE WAR LOVER.  Full of suspense and death wish.  Great film to see Steve McQueen portray a very good villain ( deeply disturbed).  Must make time to watch the other 3 flicks on this dvd.,1451174400,2,263,4.6521739130434785

5793274,4,B00DDT0J88,I bought this set for the war lover. It is one of Steve McQueen. While it is not in the league with twelve O'clock high It is still a very good movie.  I had Anzio on VHS so I was glad to get it on DVD.  It is also a very good war movie with an excellent cast. HellCats of the Navy is also a good WW2 film. It is not one of the greats but if you are a fan of Ronald Raegan I think you will like it. The last one the night of the generals is a real dog. I didn't even finish it.  So in my opinion you get if you can get the set for under $10.00 you have a Bargain.,1425081600,,563,3.4523809523809526
