7576301,5,B019KDXBA8,I absolutely love this anime. It is probably my top favorite. I am looking forward to it coming out because I will definitely be buying it right away.,1452988800,3,150,4.392857142857143
7576302,5,B019KDXBA8,This is an amazing anime. Haven't seen anything as good as this in a really long time and it's in blu ray ! Can't wait till both sets are released,1452816000,3,146,3.9

7576304,5,B019KDXBA8,"Parasyte: The Maxim was by far one of the best anime series of 2015.  Each episode leaves you wanting more, which is what a good show should do.  That being said you can't really ask for much better cliffhangers.  On top of that I love how they transformed the main character from a weak kid o the hero.  The bottom line is that if you like blood, gore, and a gripping story then you will love Parasyte.

Contains episodes 1-12.

Special Features: Clean Opening and Closing Animations.

Spoken Languages: English, Japanese, English subtitles.",1452384000,13,542,4.763440860215054
7576305,4,B019KDXBA8,"Ok so the show is pretty good. A little boring in the beginning but it really picks up well. My complaint is this collectors edition. Literally the only point in getting this is for the really Kool box it comes with. All of the extras in here are so dumb. Temporary tattoos? Oh you mean the ones that are temporary and then they're gone Ila's if they never existed? It's a temporary item that's gone as soon as you use it once. And then we get to the cleaning cloth. Really? If you don't have glasses that thing will sit in the box until moths eat it in another century. And now we get to the migi. I understand that's really more a matter for taste but I personally still think it's horribly lame looking. And the worst part? The price. Other sentai collectors edition are also expensive sure, but they actually came with good stuff. The box is just not work nearly 120 bucks, sorry sentai.",1452124800,4,891,4.341317365269461
7576306,5,B019KDXBA8,"I really really REALLY hope this new expensive collection 1 and collection 2 ordeal is just a fad...I just used a whole lot of money buying the Platinum collection of Evangelion after discovering my perfect collection was shaky-cam. Jeez, cut me a break, ADV. But hey, was that a pointless comment? Not really; I'll bring it up later. But, for now: HOORAH! I knew I'd be seeing you around again, oh tragic masterpiece of action and romance and sci-fi and everything else under the sun! If you were not aware, ""Parasyte"" is an anime that came out in 2014 that passed under more than a few radars, including myself. But let me tell you a little something about this near-perfect series: It is near-perfect. Let us merge with my observations for a second.

STORY: It's an alien invasion. But, wouldn't you believe, this is the quietest alien invasion I have ever seen. Most of the story is focused on one character, Shinichi, and his symbiotic relationship with a parasitic alien he dubs ""Migi"" as he must face many painful encounters and losses while surviving with the otherworldly leech in his hand. It's usually an ""alien of every four weeks"" deal, as the story is focused on the character of Shinichi himself and his concealment of Migi rather than the overall invasion. Keep this in mind, unless you want to be overwhelmingly disappointed by the final arc. Also, if you were expecting some grand plan or mystery behind the alien invasion...You'd best keep your expectations at ""Blue Gender"" level.

CHARACTERS: This is Shinichi's story. Many have compared the layout to ""Tokyo Ghoul,"" as well as these two characters' battle to stay human, but the difference is all too different: Kaneki's is a battle of the mind, while Shinichi's is a battle of the heart. This puts him on a level playing field with Shinji from ""Neon Genesis Evangelion,"" with Shinji-sized problems. Unlike NGE, however, the world-invasion NEVER takes priority in the story over Shinichi's battle to remain human, and it is only at the very end that survival surpasses emotional turmoil. You see, Shinichi is becoming more and more emotionless, cut off from others, overwhelmed by the feelings of painful loss and a lack of control...Seems more like Shinji, doesn't it? Unlike Shinji, though, Shinichi is alone in the battle against the aliens, with only Migi who can really stand up with him. Also, unlike Shinji, Shinichi toughens up and confronts his situations as he begins to understand them, which leads to great character development, even to a point where it's necessary for him to backtrack to remain human. That is ingenious. I won't mention the side characters, as there are many, but the aliens all have different feelings towards humans, and the humans who interact with Shinichi certainly hit us hard when they are forced through pain. Oh, did I mention? Major characters live on the edge here; no one is safe. Unlike ""Akame ga Kill,"" though, Parasyte plays these cards smart for the best emotional impact, and doesn't always show what you'd expect.

ANIMATION: Some of the best to date. No fooling. Shiny, crisp coloring with fluid movement and brilliant designs. No two aliens are alike in shape, and this makes for some truly terrifying creatures. This is an exceptional update from the graphic novel, with aesthetically pleasing characters, and I must say that the backgrounds always make sure we know where we are and at what time; I love the lighting. The action scenes are breathtaking, up there with ""Sword Art Online"" and ""Attack on Titan"" (When it isn't showing us still-frames). You really have to see it to believe it.

SOUND: This is a horrific tragedy; the music, consequently, knows its roots. The opening, ""Let Me Hear,"" is fast-paced and high-pitched, with a beat to rival all others. Be warned there is dubstep, but, even as a classical and 80s rock fan myself, I surprisingly like it; it ACCENTUATES the greatness of the opening, which could be a pop song without the addition of dubstep. This is truly one of the greatest, and most original, openings in any anime, period. Check it out. The ending is a lovely piano pop song, slow and steady, to remind us of the tragic romantic elements. It's a perfect ending to each episode as the situation grows sadder and sadder. Anyone remember ""Toradora!""? Remember the track ""Lost My Pieces""? ""Parasyte"" has one of those, too, in the form of ""Next to You."" This is the best part of the score that I can remember, and I hope you'll forgive me if I cannot recall any of the other tracks. But, to the best of my memory, they were very good.

HORROR: I seem to have been reviewing quite a few horror anime...But those tend to be few and far between. This is one of the better horror anime, and it is in this that it shares most of its qualities with ""Tokyo Ghoul."" The gore and blood is plentiful, and the body horror is some of the most gruesome and inspiring you'll see when the aliens transform. HOWEVER, like I've stated in my ""Corpse Party: Tortured Souls"" review, the real horror is what these characters have to be put through before they break or perish. And if they don't do either, then it is the horror of what they have to go on living with. ""Parasyte"" excels in this sort of anguish, molding Shinichi into one of the best anime tragic heroes in a very long time. In fact, perhaps since ever.

If you haven't seen this, you must. If you don't own this...well, it does cost a pretty penny, but I suggest you get it on Blu-Ray. If it's not in your budget, then wait; Blu-ray is the only route for this, and you can avoid the limited edition unless you are a true fan. I am a true fan, but I blew my cash by not checking reviews of Evangelion collections and I KNOW there will be a collection dos on the way, so keep your eyes peeled. ""Parasyte"" is so worth the money and makes for a fantastic character-study experience like no other, complete with heart-thumping action and heart-gripping romance. If you're queasy, pass it up, but I'm telling you that you will be missing something completely separated from the typical horror experience. ""Tokyo Ghoul"" came close to doing it well; ""Parasyte"" comes close to doing it perfectly. Take my word as you see fit.",1451433600,21,6212,4.710211591536338

7576317,1,B019KDXBA8,"What the hell did I buy? I was expecting a gruesome, alien war with displaced characters and epic battles. This a slow, love story with occasional violence. Also this seemed censored. They black out all the gruesome stuff. So annoying we live in this nanny state where adults can't enjoy the intended impact the artist was shooting for. This stupid love story is all Mickey Moused-up for wimpy American eyes.",1480896000,2,408,4.8428571428571425

7576339,5,B019KDXBA8,"This anime is a rare gem. I wasn't really expecting to like this show as much as I did since I don't particularly love gory shows, but this anime brings a lot more to the table than just blood. Parasyte is a bit of a slow watch at first but keep in mind the series is actually 24 episodes. If you want a complete story you will need to buy this collection and the second season.

That being said the pacing is normal for a series that long, with only one or two episodes spent on filler. The anime starts right away with the main male character being 'infected' or 'inhabited' by a parasyte. The parasyte's goal is to make it into the hosts brain and take over their body, however as soon as the parasyte tries to enter it is stopped by the character waking up from his sleep. The parasyte only manages to make it into the mans arm and is forced to bond/take over only that portion. Since the parasyte fails to take over the brain, the male lead retains control over his brain but not his hand. From there the story revolves around a coming to terms for both the man and the parasyte as they realize they are stuck together and must work together in order to survive. Other parasytes are also present throughout the series and they were successfully able to enter the hosts brains and take control over them. The other parasytes only seem interested in killing humans for food or for research. Parasytes can sense one another and will sometimes try to kill each other.

The main male struggles with his new parasyte and the abilities it gives him, like super speed, strength, vision/hearing, etc. However they slowly learn to trust each other and become determined to take out the other parasytes that are killing and eating humans. The show is very engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is a lot of blood in this series, I mean a lot; just look at that cover! Nothing is done too graphically but you should be aware that this show kills off characters like its Game of Thrones.

The dub is very well done, the art style is good, and the show is certainly worth owning but remember to get both season 1 and 2 for the complete ending. And Yes, there is a complete ending on season 2. No cliffhangers! The only drawback some might find to the show (that the manga might answer) is where did those parasytes come from? The series does a great job of questioning life, death, birth, and meaning of life but I don't think its supposed to provide those answers to you. It gets a little philosophical towards the end.",1474848000,11,2527,4.395299145299146
7576340,5,B019KDXBA8,"There is not enough praise for this anime. I am 38 and I do not recall being so invested in characters in almost no other series or movie since Persona 3 and Attack on titan... and I think, as of this writing, that this one trumps them both, something I though would never happen.

Yes it is something like invasion of the body snatchers, but that is just the means to get us to think about what makes us human, what are we doing to the planet our double moral stances... and of course to get to know the characters their families, their ordeals, their love, their hate and sorrow... and that is what makes this, what I can sum up in one word, MASTERFUL anime.

I watched it digital but I want my money to support the studio and whomever made this possible.
I did cry with Kana and that is as much praise as I can give to any storyteller I was invested I believed in all the characters I had to believe in.

I do recommend the OST, it is also a 5 star endeavour... however the track ""Next to you"" is on a level all by it's own the crown jewel.",1474761600,,1043,4.078048780487805

7576369,5,B019KDXBA8,"I remember seeing the Toonami promo, and was so hyped that I would finally get the chance to see it after hearing recommendations from a friend. The plot and ideas of this show are so original and unique (although fighting for humanity seems to be a popular concept due to Attack On Titan and what not) and it has my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end. The animations and colors are beautiful, and I really enjoy each unique parasyte transformations within each episode.

After finishing Season 1, I quickly and aggressively ordered Season 2 as I cannot wait to see how this series turns out. I would definitely recommend this series to everyone. Also, I kind of like the hip hop instrumentals and dubstep music that plays in the background. I didn't expect it, but I'm glad it's there. If your unsure about this series, please at least give it a try. Get to know Migi and Shinichi. They will not disappoint you.",1467590400,4,924,4.566265060240964

7576373,5,B019KDXBA8,Great anime series that both my wife and I enjoyed. There is a lot of gore but there is also a touching story of maturation.

7576389,3,B019KDXBA8,"**Update: This review was originally written for the part 1 limited edition box set, which has since been removed from amazon, not the standard Bluray collection. So I apologize for any confusion about this.

First off, I want to say that this review is NOT a review of the anime, but of this particular box set. I absolutely love this show and I was so excited for its release, but when I got my limited edition in the mail I was quite disappointed. The chip board box for it is huge, and they needlessly have 2 separate DVD sized cases for both the DVD and Bluray disks. Not only that but they put a special spot in the chip board box for the ""extras"", which honestly aren't all that exciting (silly temporary tattoos, cleaning cloth, and a lego sized key chain), instead of leaving space to put part 2. So you end up having to pay extra for a second special chip board box along with the part 2 limited edition, leaving you with 2 massive oversized chip board boxes for both part 1 & 2 that take up a ridiculous amount of space with random useless crap for ""extras"". It is such a waste of space and none of the extras really make it worth the additional costs, with the exception of the soundtrack that's set to come with part 2...they would have been better off including an actual figure and a poster or something for the extras, instead of temporary tattoos and a cleaning cloth, and then made the box set a bit more condensed and economical in size. And on top of that, I pre-ordered this months before it's release at about $120 which then dropped to about $98 and remained there, then on the day of the release the price dropped to like $78...its nice to think that they'd just screw over the devoted fans who were willing to pre-order the show in advance by dropping the prices so soon after we already paid so much for them. Needless to say I've returned it for a refund and plan on waiting until they release a complete collection or for the price to go down later on.",1460419200,7,1980,4.351351351351352

7576391,5,B019KDXBA8,"I was super excited to get this set when I first saw the blu-ray on here. This series is very dark, fast paced, and addicting. The sound track, from the metal intro, to the dubstep in the scenes, is one of the best I've heard in an anime. The story has a very superhero type feel to it, which is unique when paired with the darkness of the anime. There are a lot of themes throughout the series that relate to psychology, human nature, and the meaning of life. I'm not sure what to compare this anime to; lots of sites compare it to Tokyo Ghoul, but I had a hard time getting into that series.

7576395,5,B019KDXBA8,"After a break of two years from a manic indulgenc in various anime shows, downloading weekly episodes with subtitles done by various groups (GG, Horrible Subs Etc.) I took a break. But then TOONAMI on Cartoon Network started airing the english dub version of Attack on Titan! Also I was on Funimation's mailing list and got an offer to good to refuse. Through my Roku I got the last three months of 2014 & all of 2015 for somewhere around  $40! maybe less... I had already read most of the Parasyte Manga and loved it. It reminded me of the classic B movies I used to watch as a kid on Sundays aired on a local station called ""Sci-Fi Theater"" but much more intense. My only criticism is the OUTRAGEOUS Price!!! sure it has some flimsy gimicks included in the regular DVD set, but $100 + ? when you figure in shipping and tax... I'll wait for the basic set. I don't need temp. tattoos, collector cards BLAH BLAH BLAH... I just want to watch the show !",1457049600,,950,4.337078651685394

This was an amazing adapted anime from the manga written in the late 80' to early 90's. Characters are well written and the thrill in the sotry is well translated into the anime.
Its Scifi Thrilling and full of action. Some action sequence are well animated but some are just ok but overall very well animated.",1454457600,4,490,4.4222222222222225

8745462,3,B019KDXBA8,"the show was good but not up to inuyasha or even yu yu hakisho level. the show was very well voiced and they made the mouths actually match the words, not sure if this was originally in Japanese or not because all the writing is not English but has translations. I'm a little confused as to why some of the reviews seem to be for a collectors edition and some are a box set, mine was just dvd's. this set of episodes is also pretty short, after you skip the credits and intro song on each episode the whole thing was only about 4-5 hours. at least it didn't end this set with a cliffhanger, not that there's a conclusion but its a good stopping point, he's not in the middle of rushing off to save someone or halfway through a fight.
the overall reason I gave this a 3 rating is the packaging. If you shake the dvd box you can feel it rattling around because the thing that holds the center disk isn't tight to anything just a little clip thing. but it didn't cause any damage to the disks themselves. at least as of when I received it. Also there's no play all button but selecting the first episode does that anyway. And lastly the previews don't actually preview the shows that it lists. they are just music videos of explosions, bullets, and bouncing boobs. I kind of liked them but it tells me nothing about those shows other than the art style.
but at 24 dollars I don't think I regret my decision to purchase it. but I don't believe I will get the next set unless I see it for sale pretty cheap.",1536969600,,1502,4.21875
8745463,5,B019KDXBA8,"From the animation, to the voice cast, to the great music, Sentai Films has adapted the manga nicely and has exceeded my expectations! I regret not buying the 2nd part of the collection, please don't make that mistake!
Shinichi Izumi is a timid, meek and not very confident high school senior, living a normal life. But after a parasite fails to invade his brain, the two races are forced to co-exsist, learning about each other everyday. The story takes a drastic turn when a tragic event in Shinichi's life causes him to have a near-death experience, in which the parasite has no choice but to temporarily merge with Shinichi 's body in order to save both their lives!
This decision makes Shinichi go through physical and emotional changes that he, and others close to him, do not fail to notice. A part of Shinichi loses his human emotions and acts only on pure instinct (which is to keep surviving- mentality of a parasite). This cold, distant and emotionless side of him makes others either weary of him, like him, or seek him for a fight.
It's an everyday battle for Shinichi to find a mutual understanding with his parasite right hand, Migi, in order to survive from other parasitic infected humans, but also from himself as he tries to keep what little humanity he has left!
Overall, this anime has me stunned at how strong it has punched down my low expectations! It is definitley worth seeing, recomending and buying. Of course, there is blood and mutilation, but not hard-core gory like I know other animes can be. Plus here is a fun fact: Its animators are the same as the Yuri On Ice!!! anime, so I won't be surprised if y'all see some familiar faces! Its soundtrack is also wonderful.",1532908800,,1698,4.644518272425249
8745464,5,B019KDXBA8,"Parasyte is a wonderful anime. Emotionally deep, very well thought out, and just all around exciting. The music is awesome beyond measure, the quality of the art is consistent and well done, and the story is perfectly linear and opens and closes without any gaps or hiccups. I highly recommend this to any and all anime lovers. I rarely see such emotion portrayed in animes, and this has such a wide array of emotions too, not just cut and dry typical clich stuff. I definitely support this anime and hope to see more with this kind of quality.",1528848000,,544,4.561224489795919
