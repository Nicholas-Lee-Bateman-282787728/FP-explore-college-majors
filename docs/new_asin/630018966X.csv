7804943,1,630018966X,"I managed video stores back in the 80's so I saw just about every movie that came out. I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in '86 or '87. Here's how bad it is: When I saw it I was on a mind altering chemical. The movie was so bad that I had to go back the next day to see if it was actually that bad or if the issues were chemically induced. If anything it was worse.

Stiff acting, cheesy plot, the flying was meh. Landing on top of a moving semi trailer would have been more impressive if there wasn't a huge platform bolted to the top of the trailer for no apparent reason (other than the helicopter landing).

I like Stephen Collins' acting, but after seeing this I could not watch anything he did for roughly 10 years.

I highly recommend that you buy this movie. It has to be seen to be believed.",1370822400,,815,4.018518518518518

7804945,4,630018966X,"Not an Academy Award film but one to enjoy anyway.  The story is of a scientist being hounded by The Big Corporation whose plans threaten his energy experiment in the wilds of Utah.  How he bests the Bad Guys (and wins the girl) is the story.  The flying sequences are worth the price of the movie and the time spent to enjoy it.
Make lots of popcorn, sit back and enjoy!",1273536000,,371,4.197183098591549
7804946,5,630018966X,"Released under the title On Dangerous Ground, the only time Choke Canyon is actually used is on the cover art. This film was released in Australia as On Dangerous Ground as well. Stephen Collins is great in the lead and Bo Svenson is entertaining throughout.
There is a great interview with Bo Svenson who tells it like it is and a few trailers for further Code Red releases. A film to be enjoyed and added to your collection.",1261612800,,426,4.4743589743589745

Stephen Collins plays an enigmatic research scientist on the verge of finding a way to tap into the energy of passing comets.  (This flick came out in 1987, about the time of Halley's last flyby.)  Unfortunately, and for reasons not very well spelled out, the research requires that he conduct his research out of the remote Choke Canyon in which he has set up what looks like a smaller version of the supercomputer built by Richard Pryor in the 3rd superman movie.  Unfortunately, Choke Canyon isn't remote enough, and Collins must contend with an evil land developer (damn those evil land developers and their...developing...ways!)  When the villain destroys Collins experiment, and time running out (the experiment must coincide with the comet's flyby) Collins must resort to a bit of rogue-heroics to force them to rebuild it.
This is actually a decent flick.  Stephen Collins is very ernest in a story that doesn't really connect (rather than land developers, couldn't they have put Collins in the middle of some war between technology firms or governments suddenly interested in his work?  Isn't the prospect of the experiment bigger than strip-malls or condos?)
Footnotes?  Oh yeah.  Footage for ""Choke Canyon"" was used in the cool video ""Silent Running"" (""Can you hear me?  Can you hear me running?"").  You may remember that as the video in which a young boy receives a package from his long-lost father, takes the package to a room in his house filled with light and, in front of his shocked mom, disappears.  (The enigmatic imagery suggests that the father is involved in some otherworldly intrigue and has sent for his son to join him).  Unfortunately, ""Choke Canyon"" has nothing to do with that video's proto-""X-Files"" plot, but is nonetheless an interesting flick.",1065571200,11,1835,5.016501650165017
