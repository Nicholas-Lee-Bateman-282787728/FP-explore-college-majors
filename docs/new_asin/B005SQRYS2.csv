4886043,5,B005SQRYS2,"This movie collection appealed to me as it had The Marcus Nelson Murder case included in the set, and as it starred Telly Savalas, I was intrigued.  I was very happy to see 6 more episodes of Kojak included in the collection and all were great to see with the master actor as  New York Lieutenant of Manhattan South.
Being from New Jersey and going to New York all my life, even when moving to my present address, brought back memories of the City.  The episodes were hard hitting with some not so, but still keeping my interest with great writing and good actors to support Mr. Savalas.  I especially like the repartee with George Savalas, Telly's brother and the relationship with Crocker, who Kojak treats as a son.  It is a great set and if you are a fan, treat yourself as I have the 6 sets after this one.  Am happy with each and every one of them.  Kudos to Lt. Kojak. Also, great to see some actors who became stars and who starred in episodes in these sets.  A good guessing game for families to try to recognize and name them.l",1425427200,,1037,4.309278350515464

4886075,4,B005SQRYS2,"Kojak: The Complete Movie Collection contains four single-sided discs, each disc contains two movies.  The first one was made in 1973 and the others were made from 1985 to 1990.  On disc 4, there is also a bonus feature - Kojak: Who Loves You, Baby?  In the feature, they cover the origins of the Kojak series, interview family and the some of the old cast as well as the ""new"" cast members for the ""new"" Kojak tv movies being made at the time (back in the late '80s).  I watched all of the movies on my computer and didn't have any problems whatsoever.  No skipping or freezing.  And I believe the picture and sound quality was good, too.

I was very excited to hear that the made-for-TV movie Marcus-Nelson Murders (1973) was being brought to dvd.  I remember seeing it many years ago and was eager to see it again because of the gritty realism and dramatic storyline.  It was based on a tragedy that happened in New York City back in 1963, which the press labeled ""The Wylie-Hoffert Career Girl Murders"".  In that case, a young African-American male (George Whitmore, Jr.) was accused of the brutal rape and slayings of two white women (Janice Wylie and Emily Hoffert).  He was eventually found innocent of the crime.  Richard Robles would eventually be charged and convicted of the murders.  In the movie, Lieutenant Theo Kojak suspects a black youth who allegedly confessed to the murder of two white girls was forced to confess to the crime.

I was so excited about seeing ""Marcus-Nelson..."" movie, I saved it for last.  So I watched the dvd in reverse order - watching the last movies on Disc 4 first - ""None So Blind"" (1990), ""It's Always Something"" (1990), then disc 3, then disc 2 and saving Marcus-Nelson on Disc 1 for last.

""Marcus-Nelson"" didn't disappoint, the same gritty, dirty locales I remember from before.  It was also shot in New York City.  That adds to the realism.  The actors overall were very good.  Gene Woodbury as ""Lewis Humes"" was okay.  I felt he played the character too much like a dimwit.  And at times he said his lines too slowly, and it took me out of the story.  But that's just my opinion.  Still by far ""Marcus-Nelson"" is best movie in this dvd set.  Also Andre Braugher is very good as detective ""Winston Blake"" (he's in the '80s and '90s Kojak movies).  Also you have some cameo appearances from the old cast, like: ""Crocker"" (Kevin Dobson), who is now an Assistant D.A., and you also have a cameo from ""Captain Frank McNeil"" (Dan Frazer).

The other made-for-TV movies are standard fare.  Don't get me wrong.  They are good movies, but except for The Marcus-Nelson Murders, in my opinion they don't really compare to the '70s Kojak tv series.  They don't have the ""edge"" that the tv series or ""Marcus-Nelson"" had.  But they are still decent movies.

A good dvd set to have if you are a fan of Lieutenant Theo Kojak.

P.S.  Also there is a mistake on the storyline listing inside the dvd cover - ""It's Always Something"",  the listing states that Kojak is framed when actually it's Kojak's assistant ""Winston Blake"" (Andre Braugher) who is framed.  Not Kojak (the bad guys were trying to send a message to Kojak...?!).",1375747200,,3997,5.658823529411765

The Belarus files was always one of my favorite movies, a lot like an early version of lets say Law and Order or other more recent deeper involved investigations.  Interestingly though, I found the movies a bit slower than more of the modern shows, which do not waste much time.  We liked seeing the Belarus file and that movie itself had a flavor of the movie great The Marathon Man.  Kojak always had the ability to make a social comment or two, but his were more of that of conscience than anything that we see political today.

Hearkening back to the more campy type TV shows, Kojak was beyond that and it was a glimps of what was to come in the deeper investigation related programming that has become the standard of today.  Get Kojak, well worth it.",1356480000,2,816,4.442953020134228

The Marcus Nelson murders is based on the true case that prompted the Miranda warning that is still required to this day.  The Kojak character is played so well by Telly Savalas, hard-boiled on the outside but still human and feeling on the inside, and working under tremendous frustration at the system's injustices and failings.  The movies hold up very well, they still seem relevant, although styles are dated.

4886098,5,B005SQRYS2,"Finally, ""The Marcus-Nelson Murders"" is on DVD.  And just perfect as to the picture quality and sound quality. Brand-new looking for a 1973 movie, the master for this was great quality and maybe even further cleaned up.  Watched it tonight upon receiving this pre-ordered item from Amazon.

A stunningly great movie as to the story, the Abby Mann script (1973 Emmy-winning), acting, etc.  An infamous, sad, true story, based on NYC's ""Career Girl Murders.""  Wonderful, not-found-anywhere-else, melancholy Andy Kim song used for the closing credits: ""Don't Give Me A Road I Can't Walk.""  It's appropriately sad music and lyrics to close the show.  The movie runs over 2:18.

""The Marcus-Nelson Murders"" is the true story of a young, decent, poor, and mildly-mentally-challenged black man who was railroaded by the Manhattan police and D.A. for the 1963 murders of two white women in their 20s, and by the Brooklyn D.A. and police for the murder of a black woman and the attempted rape of a Puerto Rican woman, all separate incidents on different days.  The young man told the police he didn't do any of these crimes, but by the next day, he had confessed, in great detail, in over 60 typewritten pages.  Because, in actuality, . . . the police had beat it out of him.  There are more twists and turns which I'll not mention here and which would ruin your viewing pleasure.  (In real life, the young black man was named George Whitmore, Jr.)  This story, as the movie notes, was one of the cases that formed the basis for the 1966 Supreme Court Miranda decision, requiring the police to read suspects their rights.

""The Belarus File"", on the same disc #1, looks to be a soft-focus film-- literally it's recorded on film, not video, but not the high-quality film stock of ""The Marcus-Nelson Murders."" Didn't watch ""The Belarus File"" through, and never saw it before.

I haven't viewed the other discs yet, but this collection is worth it just for the magnificent copy of the now-released, great, ""The Marcus-Nelson Murders"" movie.",1327449600,38,2028,4.854651162790698

SF lists the movies:
  The Marcus-Nelson Murders (1973)
  The Belarus File (1985)
  The Prince of Justice (1987)
  Ariana (1989)
  Fatal Flaw (1989)
  None So Blind (1990)
  It's Always Something (1990)
  Flowers For Matty (1990)

None of these movies are on the first or second season sets.

I love these pre-tech detective movies. Technology is no substitute for a keen mind and a knowledge of human nature. And Kojak mysteries always have a good escape quality; good wins, evil loses, and the viewer isn't immersed in gratuitous gore and perversion on the way.",1322006400,97,737,4.845528455284553

8485303,4,B005SQRYS2,"Excellent acting and interesting stories.  Telly Savalas always brings the whole of himself in everything in which he appears.  I was raised in a small community in rural Southwest Virginia.  Folks that lived there were named; Tuck, Carper, Linkous, and Carroll.  The names used in the Kojak series were and are unfamiliar to me.  Because of that difference, I had a very tough time keeping track of the characters in the story.  One thing that I did enjoy immensely were the gritty scenes of the darker sections of New York City.  It probably doesn't many visitors yet, it is what make Kojak so real.",1501891200,,601,4.721153846153846
