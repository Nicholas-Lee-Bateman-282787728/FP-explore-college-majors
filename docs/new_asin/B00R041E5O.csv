6891272,1,B00R041E5O,Please do not  order this DVD because you will be highly disappointed when you realize that it is an abridged version of the original soap opera.  There are so many important scenes missing that made this soap opera the success that it was and it will be really hard for you to follow or appreciate it with all the missing material.  This seller should definitely specify that this is not a complete version.,1503014400,5,408,4.561643835616438

6891299,2,B00R041E5O,"Whoever edited the dvds left out huge chunks of the story. Some of the edits are slapped together and make no sense.

6891300,1,B00R041E5O,"Purchased it thinking it is the T.V. version...WRONG!! It is butchered, missing all the good parts. You see one thing then jumps to scenes that does not relate to previous. Says it is mfg from Televisa, it is not. It is made in U.S by Cinedigm.  Not only that, some dvds were not working, would freeze and skip",1500681600,2,310,4.344827586206897

If We knew it wasn't going to play the entire show we would have never ordered it.",1462924800,7,595,4.321428571428571
6891314,4,B00R041E5O,"Pros:
There is only one big pro if you watched this Mexican soap on Univision. This DVD contains 4 extended love scenes between Alejandro & Montserrat that were cut almost completely from the Univision airing because of their strict censors. Hot love scenes that were essential in understanding the strong pull and passion between them and the strong  chemistry between  the actors- Angelique Boyer & Sebastian Rulli. That alone is worth owning this DVD. If that's not eniugh, we get sexy stuff from some of the other couples, such as Demitrio and Monica and 15 hours worth of great scenes and gorgeous scenery and actors.

Cons:
Almost 200 episodes condensed into 15 hours. A LOT gets lost but it's still relatively easy to follow the story if you watched the uncut version first. The picture quality is OK not excellent. No English captions for non-Spanish speakers.",1461542400,,868,4.931506849315069
6891315,1,B00R041E5O,"I was watching this telenovela on Netflix and they stopped showing it before I was even done. Boooo!!! I was hooked on it. So, I bought this dvd set to finish the show. How disappointing! It was missing alot of the scenes. It was choppy. There was no flow. They just cut and pasted scenes, there was no story to follow. The whole time I was wtf happened? How did they get here? I wonder if I can still return this piece of crap.

I would not recommend",1460937600,11,451,4.125

6891328,2,B00R041E5O,"Televisa should be ashamed of themselves for putting this DVD up for sale. No subtitles, not on the configuration or available through the TV.
There are entire sections where the voices are not synchronized with the actual picture! I have several other telenovelas produced by Vivendi, and they have all been great. Televisa should FIRE Cinedigm (the company) they hired to produce the video and they should REFUND everyone who bought the dvd set!!! SHAME on them!!",1436832000,7,465,5.0519480519480515

6891341,5,B00R041E5O,"So far, I've been listening to Lo Que la Vida Me Robo, and it is a pretty good edit job of the original. What I most enjoyed about the film was that the set is gorgeous. The second thing that was fun for me is that one of the stars was a friend of my Puerto Rican French student when she was in college. I have met a lot of actors - I worked at the UN in New York, where I met Marlon Brando. I physically walked right into Milton Berle, and I was a counselor for Bill Hayes' daughter at camp. But it's always fun to know a little bit about people who work on T.V. or on the stage. My student  says that the actor in question was a very nice guy. I guess she knew him before he went off to acting school. Since he turns into something of a monster towards the end of the film, I guess acting school was a big help!  Seriously, I watch all these telenovelas because I have to teach Spanish, and I had forgotten every word I'd learned in graduate school. So four years ago when it became apparent that I was going to have to speak to people in Spanish, I realize that my only salvation was Univision. Since then I've become fluent because I watch telenovelas for two hours a night while I bicycle. Then I watch the films again when they're transferred onto DVDs.",1427155200,4,1259,4.07258064516129

8693440,1,B00R041E5O,"I read other reviews and thought I should still give it a try. But I should have listened!! It skips way too many parts, seems like Almost episodes here and there.
