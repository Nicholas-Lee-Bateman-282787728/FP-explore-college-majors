It  doesn't take any  special skill, just a bit of  practice and you  are on you way to making lovely letters. I am glad I bought this  book. I am not  one to  learn things on my own. I  usually do much  better with someone showing me something but  this  book is easy  peasy to learn the techniques  .Highly  recommend this book.",1502236800,,474,4.159090909090909
