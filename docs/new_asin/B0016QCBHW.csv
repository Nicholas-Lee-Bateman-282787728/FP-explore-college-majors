8264092,5,B0016QCBHW,"Love watching this Japanese Film over and over again,I cried a lot from the last part,because the actor realized that the girl,who chased him was gone forever due to an illness and he was surprised,that all the good memories that the girl was being collected as a love photograph that was exhibited in New York Gallery.that's why the soundtrack album fits perfectly titled as ""Love Photographed"" or in Japanese,Renai Shashin,this film was perfect for Valentines Day.",1420675200,,466,5.144736842105263
8264093,4,B0016QCBHW,"I just love the places this movie shows you. the story is also a great story of love, that uses that geeky and unaware kind of love that asian directos can put on their films. based on other previous movie, this one at least gives you a warm feeling and a good and emotive ending. I wanted to learn to take pictures after I watched this movie.",1345075200,,343,4.134328358208955
8264094,5,B0016QCBHW,"I was a bit surprised by the sometimes frank and honest dialog coming from Aoi Miyazaki's character in what for the most part is a very family friendly bit of Japanese young love/first love cinema. But it is appropriate for her character, a set-to-mature-at-any-moment young woman deficient in some necessary growth hormones needed to push her over the edge (that when triggered by a first kiss could ultimately be her ... undoing) and seems trapped in young adolescence. It's a very cute and cute-funny, and really sad, sad, film. Miyazaki teeters the edge between coy and seductive so well it made me dizzy ... with delight. I could, however, understand her pouty lipped attempts at cuteness turning some folks off. She does slip out of it each time very quickly, though. That's part of her charm, I guess.

The film is beautifully photographed. The 'heavenly' forest is fairy-tale gorgeous, as are the three young actors we spend time with. The story is engaging too, clearly a novel-adapted one.",1250553600,3,999,4.946428571428571
8264095,4,B0016QCBHW,"This movie is about growing up and falling in love, or better to say growing up because you have fallen in love. Excellent story and characterization. Romantic, humorous, and sad.",1234828800,2,179,5.0
8264096,5,B0016QCBHW,"This movie was totally amazing. far beyond what I expected. And since I am a hopeless romantic any way, this film has done more than captured my heart. It is a tale of friendship and unselfish love. any one who values true friendship and desires true love should watch this film. You will not be disappointed.",1220745600,4,309,4.535714285714286
