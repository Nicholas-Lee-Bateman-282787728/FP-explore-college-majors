2915874,5,B000U1ZV9Y,Good scope and breadth of WWII with some little know facts that I never heard before and I watch just about every WWII history and military channel special.,1285977600,,156,4.607142857142857
2915875,4,B000U1ZV9Y,"I first saw this on the Military channel and liked it, so bought the DVD set. It is really good and a great collection for anyone interested in WW2. The episodes are interesting and lots of good footage. I gave this 4 not 5 stars because I have two issues.

1. The episode list on the box is not in order and there is nothing inside the box with the episode detail. To find a specific episode you have to play all the discs until you find it.

2. I found some of the footage and introductions to the episodes are repeated in other episodes. Also some of the video I have seen in other shows like World at War.

Overall a great series and I put it on a par with World at War. This one being made more recently.",1285027200,10,709,4.01418439716312
2915876,5,B000U1ZV9Y,"Another great series from Nugus Martin. However, I must disagree with some of my fellow reviewers regarding the background music. Although it is louder than some of the other series from these producers, I was able to hear the narration easily. As with most all Nugus Martin videos, the music is provided by the De Wolfe library (the oldest of its kind in the world). I feel the De Wolfe soundtrack fits very nicely with Robert Powell's classy British narration, reminiscent of Century of Warfare. If you liked Century of Warfare, Great Blunders in History,  Heroes and Weapons of WWII or WWII In Colour, you will enjoy this set, as it is more of the same great documentary fun, full of interesting information.",1277942400,5,711,4.780487804878049
2915877,1,B000U1ZV9Y,"This DVD and the other two in the series have very intrusive background or, should I say, foreground, music that simply will not fade or go away. It is loud and ""in your face"". Not an intelligent way to create a documentary. I cannot watch this.

There is now a new documentary called ""WW II in HD Coulour"". It is by the same production team and narrator. I immediately recognized the background music again, BUT, this time it is subdued and in the background where it belongs.",1272672000,5,477,4.482758620689655
2915878,5,B000U1ZV9Y,"This is a great collection for any history buff. I have been a fairly active student of military history for over 50 years and thought I pretty much knew it all when it came to WW II.
This collection has some great video I had not previously seen as well as lots of interesting and obscure information. Many details regarding the breaking of the enigma code. Some interesting British secret missions. A great piece on the German daylight run through the English Channel with 3 capital ships.
The 26 one hour BBC programs in this collection provide some new perspectives on World War II that will interest most armchair historians.",1246752000,2,630,4.736363636363636
2915879,5,B000U1ZV9Y,"Great Footage Very Informative
 I love the uniforms .
The music isn't too big  it keeps your attention .
If your into history of ww2 this is a must see!",1238803200,3,152,4.033333333333333
2915880,4,B000U1ZV9Y,Only buy this if you are a WW2 nut - which I am. There is a lot of good stuff in these and a lot of duplication. The World at War series is far far better. But if you can't get enough of WW2 and particularly the intelligence side you will be pleased with this set.,1233878400,4,264,3.732142857142857
2915881,3,B000U1ZV9Y,"The documentary is, as expected, informative. However, it is overshadowed by the totally unfit and very intrusive Sound score, consisting entirely of fast-paced action-scene, militaristic music, mixed in way too loudly. Think of the music during an action scene from an Indiana Jones movie, and stick this score on a calmly narrated documentary - it does not work at ALL. Even after watching all DVD's, this was quite annoying still.",1203033600,6,433,5.2

 These four TV series are valuable in treating interesting phenomena of World War II that are less frequently covered on video. Each episode is in stereo, 4:3 format, and vintage B&W (mostly) and vintage color, with modern embellishments (maps, background info, etc.) in color. The quality of the archival footage is variable of course, but all is watchable. The quality of the modern color supplements is very good to excellent (e.g., Bletchley Park). Narration is by actor Robert Powell (born 1944).

2915906,2,B000U1ZV9Y,"I have been a BBC junkie for years because of the top notch research and production that goes into their titles. Their choice of narration; Robert Powell, David Attenbourgher etc. is simply the best. Having seen this series on the Military Channel, I was very much looking forward to having this boxed set.

BAD DECISION.

The quality control in the manufacturing process on the BBC's dvd disks is horrid. I had two disks in this set that will not play at all. I have tried to play the material on four different dvd players and all disks create errors in the same spots on the disks. I know that the players are not the problem, as I have hundreds of other movies that play without issue. The disks themselves are scratch free as well.

I believe the issue is with the BBC's transfer and manufacturing process with double-sided dvd disks, as I have not had issue with any of their single-sided material. It is an absolute shame that the once great BBC is destroying such a wonderful series with their poor quality control.

If you can find a set that actually plays correctly, then this series is top notch. I have purchased Secrets of World War II, Heroes and Weapons of World War II, and Gladiators of World War II. Out of those three sets, the only one that was free of manufacturing defect was Gladiators of World War II.",1357948800,3,1326,4.5125
2915907,5,B000U1ZV9Y,"For the history buffs, the World War II enthusiasts and the plain old army aficionados this DVD collection set has your name on it. There are 26 chapters on World War II secrets and yes some scenes are repeated multiple times. When it comes to the breaking of the German code, since it played an important role in a number of war secrets you will see parts of the code breaker's secret house a number of times. (I too was tired of seeing hut 6 video played over and over again.)
However, I am recommending this DVD collection because a lot of the film footage is new and each chapter is given enough time to go into the important details. But, I want to warn you its 24 hours of non-stop action even I could not keep my eyes open that long. It took me to 2 weeks to watch all the chapters.",1351123200,5,789,4.163398692810458
2915908,5,B000U1ZV9Y,"This is a series that is shown on the Military channel.  This is well worth the money it costs.  This series was just made a few years ago.  There are over 20 great episodes about sometimes little known facts about the war.  I have hundreds of WWII DVDs and this series goes up in the top 10% shelf.  If you think you know everything about WWII, this series will make you even smarter....",1334188800,5,388,4.260273972602739
2915909,1,B000U1ZV9Y,"I purposely looked at the description details to make sure this was close captioned as I was going to give it to my 91 year old father for Christmas.
He is hard of hearing and CC was extremely important.
I saw nothing related to this issue in the reviews.
Imagine my disappointment when I looked all over the case, only to find in tiny print ""no subtitles""!
Your description of Close Captioned really mis led me.
I am sending this back.

2915910,5,B000U1ZV9Y,"I'm a regular viewer of Secrets of World War ll, and though I'm satisfied with the series overall, I can't help but notice errors consistent with most historical documentaries. Often footage, does not match the topic. All too often the wrong class of ship tank or aircraft is shown. There were no American Battleships at Midway, but there are several shots of -of all things- Iowa class battleships firing their 16"" guns. The Iowas weren't even in service until late 1943. The dizzy narrator from the Scharnhorst episode, keeps referring to the class as ""pocket battleships"". The Scheer class were pocket battleships, the Scharnhorst class were full sized -albeit undergunned- battlecruisers. The improper use of the word decimated which seems to be rampant in almost all war documentaries is extremely annoying. Decimated means one out of 10 or 10%, the correct word for wiped out is annihilated. When commenting on tanks, the upgunned variants are never mentioned or are incorrectly attributed to original design. For instance, the Sherman was originally armed with the mediocre 75 mm gun and thin armor, later marks had the 76 mm gun and better protection. The Firefly had the 76.2 mm -17 pdr- gun that was actually superior to the Panther's 75mm long. The T34 was originally armed with a 76.2mm gun but was later upgunned to an 85mm version with an improved turret. It's offensive to those of us who know our stuff to see such generalizations and footage inconsistencies in documentaries that are supposed to be factual and written by supposed experts. One last thing, the Japanese weren't using Kamikazes yet in 1942 when Midway was fought. One Japanese pilot did fly his plane into an American carrier after being shot down, but it was the only time during the battle, and it wasn't an Essex class carrier, or baby carrier -they weren't in service yet-, that recieved the attack. Doesn't anybody who knows what they're doing when researching the footage for historical docs? WTH? I do, however, enjoy Secrets of World War ll in spite of these blatant errors.",1320969600,29,2064,4.9510086455331415
2915911,5,B000U1ZV9Y,"22+ hours of BBC styled/quality documentaries. I prefer these to more recent documentaries that include modern re-enactments that I often find historically objectionable.

Determining what's on each disc is a bit of a challenge. Each disc specifies the episodes it contains, such as ""Episodes 1-4"" and ""Episodes 5-8"" on the reverse side. On the back of the packaging, the episodes are listed in order, but without the corresponding episode number. So, your either going to have to count or print out your own episode listing.",1316736000,2,525,5.176470588235294
