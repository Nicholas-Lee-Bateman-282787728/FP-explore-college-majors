8459680,5,B0056IWXE2,this is the best I have seen. I tend to agree with his research. Definitely makes the most sense to me,1460073600,,102,3.9047619047619047

8459682,3,B0056IWXE2,"A classic case of deciding first, then setting about to prove it - which to my mind is clearly the backward version of science. In short, I would not recommend this DVD to anyone with a serious interest in such investigations.",1403308800,,226,4.536585365853658

8459684,2,B0056IWXE2,"Only for the purists and must have it all of Ripper things.  Not a bad made film, a bit full of itself, did pretty good - up to the point where they go on then, to FIND him and relate the big climax, to a little ""Tweet"" rated and brief statement of why they think he is, who they think he is.
