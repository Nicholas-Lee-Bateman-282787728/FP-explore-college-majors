4249192,3,B0042DN4XG,"Years ago, I discovered Robert Whitlow's writing through his debut novel, ""The List."" Since then, he's written a string of legal thrillers with a meandering Southern feel. Last year, ""The List"" was released as a movie, but my high hopes for it were dashed by wooden acting, romanticizing lighting, and a fair share of cheesy moments. It felt like an 80s, made-for-TV movie.

As a fan of Whitlow's books, I decided to give ""The Trial"" a chance--though with much lower expectations. The story revolves around a young man accused of murder, when his date is found dead with roofies in her system. He claims he didn't do it. His court-appointed lawyer is depressed Mac MacLain, a man who lost his wife and children years earlier in an auto accident. While there's nothing particularly original--even Grisham's storylines have become cliched--it's a definite stride forward from the earlier film. It's amazing the amount of time, energy, and manpower that goes into making a movie, and I have utmost respect for those who undertake this task. Yes, the lighting still has that romanticized feel that went out about fifteen years ago, and yes, the acting is still one notch below, but most of these issues could've been resolved on the directing and editing end. Robert Forster does a nice job in his role, and the female counselor did as well, while others wore furrowed brows in far too many scenes.

It's nice to see this film getting distribution through Redbox and Netflix, and I'm glad to see Christian novels being made into films, but I would love to see a more modern artistic mindset applied to such efforts. The average American is a movie buff, and their expectations are high. Sadly, for me, ""The Trial"" never quite lived up. Nevertheless, knowing the quality of Whitlow's novels, I hope we can see another of his books translated to film in a way that captures his storytelling power.",1292198400,2,1891,4.851393188854489
4249193,1,B0042DN4XG,"This movie is awful. It sounds from the description like a second rate John Grisham pot boiler; in reality it's more like fifth rate.

Script is amateurish and predictable, dialog is wooden, it hits every cliche in the courtroom drama book, and the plot ultimately makes no sense. Aside from Robert Forster (always great, imho) the acting is almost nonexistent.

And what the hell happened to Matthew Modine? He looks and acts like a zombie in this film. In fact, if he WAS a zombie, it would have been much better. Two hours of my life and $4 I will never get back. Don't you make the same mistake.",1292112000,6,599,4.486238532110092
4249194,2,B0042DN4XG,"I was tempted to dump this movie several times.  The dialogue, particularly in the trial is not realistic.  The jury verdict in no way reflects the evidence.  Everything about this silly movie was predictble and boring.

4249196,5,B0042DN4XG,"So I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  I saw that it had decent ratings on IMDb and Netflix.  This is probably one of the best performances of Matthew Modine I've seen in years.  It's good to see him in a lead role again.  The supporting actors were perfectly placed as well... like Robert Forster as the P.I. and the guy who played the Warden from ""Shawshank Redemption"" as the prosecutor.  It didn't seem to get much publicity (as I guess most indie films can't afford to do) but it definitely should have.  This film really was like finding a hidden gem... very well-crafed for a small film.  Kept me thoroughly engaged all the way through. Great find.",1290729600,,703,4.531746031746032
4249197,4,B0042DN4XG,"THE TRIAL, adapted from Robert Whitlow's novel of the same name by director Gary Wheeler and Mark Freiburger, is in many ways a reminder of what movies used to be - movies that centered on trials of innocent victims or trials that, like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, surfaced other issues to ponder. This film is a quiet little intimate tale about the justice system in all its elegance and flaws, but it is more: there are human stories that interweave giving the film an aura of caring that is so rare in today's CGI-oriented Hollywood.

The film is set in the beauty of Georgia countryside, complete with mists and fields and rivers where we first see attorney Mac MacClain (Matthew Modine), pensive after the accidental death of his wife and two children nine years ago. His practice has fallen, his mental sate has fallen below the flatline state, and he is contemplating suicide when a telephone call from the wise old town judge (Rance Howard) summons him to take on a case of the murder of one Angela Hightower, the young and beautiful daughter of the wealthiest man in the little town, the corrupt Hightower family being part of Mac's sad past encounters. The accused is Angela's boyfriend Pete Thomason (an impressive Randy Wayne) who is now in jail claiming he had total amnesia for the event. Mac feels a sense of responsibility to the boy and agrees to take on the case, hiring back his assistant Mindy (Nikki Deloach) and his investigator Ray (Robert Forster). As they uncover facts Mac seeks advice from psychologist Dr. Anna Wilkes (Clare Carey) who in addition to testing Pete finds time to share her Grieving Group Sessions with Mac.

The evidence is gathered and the trial begins after a plea bargain is denied by Pete. The Hightower lawyer is the brilliant, eloquent but ruthless Joe Whetstone (a fine performance by Bob Gunton) and the battle of wits and rights is on. The courtroom drama is well written and the turn of events from the trial to the followup findings and second trial are well molded. If the film ends in a too saccharine mode, the quality of acting in the film before that should make the audience tolerate the preachiness. There are some fine cameos -Larry Bagby, Burgess Jenkins, Brett Rice among them - and there is much to learn about contemporary youth habits and small town tenor. This is not a great film, but it is a refreshing memory of the small and intimate films of yesteryear. Grady Harp, November 10",1290470400,15,2445,4.696969696969697

4249199,4,B0042DN4XG,"This is somewhat like a Life Time movie, but better. It's about a man who is a lawyer asked to take on a case by an old Judge who wants to make sure the defendant is defended without a hitch.  The state's attorney is pretty ruthless in a bland sort of way when prosecuting the case.  It's a mystery where inner turmoil is explored, sometimes with great anguish.  If you are looking for a thrill a minute, this ain't it.  This is a slow building mystery suspense that makes the viewer actually think about what is going on.

Usually, I am very let down and disappointed or so frustrated and aggravated that I drive my poor husband crazy listing every deviation from the ""original"".
I didn't choose to give this the fifth star because, while as a Christian I loved that they put in Faith in God being what heals you and your pain from loss! I didn't like the ending where he was talking about the loss and said, that he reached the day when he quit being ???? (Mad, Angry I don't remember his exact word) that his family was gone and started ""being thankful he had lived.""
I don't know, it just struck a false cord with me. I can't imagine anyone actually saying that!
Maybe, ""being thankful for the years I had with them and feel I can now live my life with some peace"".

It is a good movie, well acted, simple movie. It is not as bad as what some people think & that's my opinion.  I liked the movie.  I heard that ""God"" has been mentioned 2 times. I pray to God everyday.  It is comforting to hear ""God's"" Name 2 times in the movie.  There is also 10 commandments posted on the Court Room Wall.  I stopped the movie and read the Commandments.

This is a 5-star movie for families - meaning children with a 10-year maturity age and above. If you are a parent looking for good non animated movies for your children, that do not have promiscuity in it to perpetuate the New American Way of Honoring Women, this is one for you. If you are an adult looking for a 4-star movie that will not ruin your time with your spouse, this is it.

In conclusion, this is a movie. This story is not far from reality, which is where the 5th star came from. Until the end, it was just fine. No movie has the details of books, why? Easy, Hollywood would rather pocket money than to give you an actual real story. I am not a fan of inaccurate movies one bit, they are a waste of my time; I am a writer. So, this family friendly writer is giving this movie a 5-star rating for families. So, the accuracy of story is as accurate as family movies; meaning, it is not teeth grinding.

Add Matthew Modine to the mix and it's a recipe for a potential hit.  Sadly, it missed the mark on nearly every level.  Even for the casual viewer the trial scenes were so silly and unrealistic that it became hard to take it seriously.  With out going through a point by point analysis of every failure in that regard here are a couple of highlights:
--A totally conflicted doctor who's also a finance manager for the victim's family??? is allowed to evaluate the defendant on behalf of the prosecution.
--The prosecutor has the defense followed and photographed
--Having coffee and pie with your expert witness is somehow a conflict but not the doctor???

I could go on and on, but it seems like it was written by someone with a loose grasp of how a trial actually works.  Again those sorts of things aren't required for every movie to be good, but when you name it ""The Trial"", it's kind of important to at least get close on some of the trial details.

Add a bevy of underdeveloped characters, a strange twist that goes from trial to suspense/thriller and the whole thing was just a little convoluted.

Slight spoiler alert:  The suspect, also a sympathetic character, is accused of killing his girlfriend but he's young, no previous record and can't remember anything from the night it happened.  Yet the hard-nosed DA asks for the death penalty and throws every obstacle at attorney Modine who's come out of retirement, deeply depressed, to take the case.

Nearly each scene was perfectly framed and could stand alone as a photograph, especially in the beginning. That said, the storyline was weak at best, I agree with another reviewer that the kid on trial had just one expression. The story lacked more ""meat"", the characters were cookie cutter: ""spunky kid sister"" of Modine's character, possible ""love at first sight"" with the psychologist, ""evil"" prosecutor. Acting is also very weak and amateurish. Very predictable at times. The ""twist"" was more like an episode of ""Columbo"". I kept waiting for it to ""rev-up"" but alas it never did.

From what I read, many of the high reviews are due to the fact that the movie had clean language and was good for all ages. That is completely fair, but does not make a movie worthy of 5 stars in my opinion. I give the movie 2 stars mainly due to the poor acting and terrible script. Much of the dialogue seems unnatural and forced. I understand that the title, 'The Trial' has dual meanings. The courtroom trial is the worst trial I've ever seen portrayed on any tv format. The defendANT (annoying pronunciation by lawyers in the film) would have been better served defending himself! The self-trial that the attorney is going through is presented in an awkward way and I could never really ""feel"" for the character. Many people gave the movie low ratings due to religious undertones. This was a very small portion of the movie, but you could definitely tell when it came about. Like the rest of the key points in the movie, it was a noticeably forced effort by the actors/actresses. If you are looking for a simple movie that you can watch with the kids and don't have to think much during, this is the movie for you.

4249332,2,B0042DN4XG,"I was really bored..my only excuse for sitting thru this loser of a movie.
The plot was nothing new, and the acting poor with just one outstanding character-the old fart truck driver who was driving too fast and got sideswiped by the missing car was the only actor who actually had some character...not character development-he presented as an old cooger and remained that way.
The balance of the characters were cardboard cutouts and C grade acting.
I found the courtroom 'drama' to be less than accurate in any courtroom, while the basic 'bad guy' was obvious from  the first introduction..really why make him such a bad person from the start if you're going to spring him as ""OMG-thats the bad guy!""  in the end.

What I find disappointing about many of the bad reviews is that people were offended that there was an aspect of faith. At least 90% of movies and television shows released today have an anti-religion narrative, yet those of us who are of faith aren't supposed to be offended by that. I would say the entertainment industry is certainly winning with their anti-God agenda, so is it such a crime that there are a few movies that still project a sense of faith by some of its characters? This is by no means a religion-based movie, but it does express a sentiment that the majority of Americans still hold. This movie deals with some dark topics and I for one found it refreshing that the creators didn't shy away from showing that turning to one's faith in hard times can often bring about hope and healing when we think we are at the end of our rope.",1487289600,6,1019,4.368421052631579

Depressed lawyer contemplating suicide with gun to his throat when the phone rings and he has to answer it (guess he wasn't that serious).  He's assigned to what looks like a losing case for the defense.  He and his team stumble along unearthing things helpful to the defense, but apparently engage in no pre-trial discovery (witness lists, depositions, etc.) so they are constantly surprised by prosecution bombs at trial.  The trial defense turns out to be more wishful thinking than anything else.  Of course, they turn up new evidence after sentencing that turns the case on its head (with an utterly predictable plot twist).

The A story is that an innocent young man is accused of capital murder with no evidence other than he was last seen with the victim and he had her car keys in his pocket. That's it. There's surprise witnesses from the prosecution (not allowed), prior bad acts (not allowed), impeachment of his own witness (not allowed.) This goes on and on to the point where the verdict makes no sense, and the reveal is so trite it's silly. The actual ""trial"" is the protagonist's struggle to re-connect with God. Though not over-handed, this message permeates the movie and while not off-putting, shows that the producers were using this rather dull and pointless story to push a message - and didn't deliver.

4249415,3,B0042DN4XG,"After watching the film and reading the comments that rated this movie as a 1 of 5, I wanted to add my thoughts and maybe adjust the thinking a little.  First, several of the bad reviews were submitted not because of the movie, but by people who probably didn't even watch the movie because of a technical issue, i.e. they couldn't get sound.  It is unfortunate that reviews like that are allowed to be a part of what is supposed to be a measure of the movie itself.  Second, I agree with some, though not all, of the statements of those who gave it the lowest possible rating.  In spite of the fact that they had some good actors, the film didn't do them justice; some of the acting was, to pick an adjective used in another review, wooden.  But, not all of it.  Several of the detractors felt that the movie was trying to push a religious theme.  Yes, there was mention of God in the film.  I believe that in the 1.5 hour movie, God was mentioned perhaps three or four times.  I would be hard pressed to say that classifies is an agenda.

I consider the movie to be OK.  I think it could have been a very good movie, but I can't help but think that the director was trying to make something out if it that it was not.  Consider the following: 1) The name of the movie is ""The Trial"".  It stands to reason that the trial should then be the the most powerful and pivotal event.  Yet, the trial scenes were nearly the weakest parts.  None of the facts in the trial were adequately pursued.  The arguments were lame and the most important detail in the case for the defense was practically ignored.  2) The movie had some good talent, yet the performances seemed stilted or unbelievable.  3) Whenever God was mentioned the event seemed really forced.

However, there was entertainment value. I watched it from beginning to end.  I just don't think it lived up to what it could have been.",1484956800,90,1885,4.346704871060172

4249439,1,B0042DN4XG,"This is a film about redemption and self forgiveness.
Mathew Modine plays a trial lawyer called out of  a self imposed retirement to defend a young man obviously not guilty of killing his murdered girlfriend. He takes the case reluctantly but soon delves deeply into the defense of this innocent youth .At first the defendant seems guilty but as the evidence is presented he is certainly innocent. We also learn of the deep pain and guilt the lawyer is feeling for the lost of his wife and child. From here on we are constantly reminded through several characters that one must forgive oneself and we can redeem ourself by helping others. He now must save the innocent man to save himself.
This movie comes off as an afternoon special with religious subtexts .We are lectured on the need to help others which will in turn help us learn to forgive ourselves. This happens many times throughout the film. It takes much away from the mystery and ultimately the solution to the crime and eventually the boys freedom.
Is this a film where the outcome of the trial is the focus or is this mans grief the focus who happens to be working  on a trial. The preaching becomes very distracting from a film that would be more exciting without the constant reminder of the true path to redemtion.
Mathew Modine has an excellent reputation as an actor with some great films to his credit. This film is just to far off his level of being able to engage the audience in a performance.  Im sure this films message is important to convey but it is so distracting to wrap it in a murder mystery trial. The truly great religious films (Ben Hur , The Ten Commandments, Inherit the Wind, etc.) entertain but do not ""preach from the pulpit"".Even the potential of a romance is halted by ""we must first learn how to forgive ourselves before we can move on"".
I was very disappointed in the true agenda of this  movie which is to sell you a religious concept and pass it off in what could have been an exciting mystery.",1441411200,3,1991,4.522222222222222

4249453,4,B0042DN4XG,"I actively look for faith/spirituality films to add to my DVD collection.  Recently I bought The Trial, which I think is a good crime story dramatized by good actors.  Matthew Modine played the defense attorney.  I was not familiar with him, but was favorably impressed by his acting.  Randy Wayne played the defendant, whose role was primarily to look confused and anguished.  I enjoyed him in To Save A Life, a film I own, in which he played a leading role.  Bob Gunton played the prosecutor -- he has appeared in many films, and does a great job whether playing the good guy or the bad guy.  But, please don't imitate his pronunciation of defendant -- in which he stresses the final syllable as ANT (those insects who enjoy picnics).  The letter /a/ in that final syllable is a schwa and sounds like /uh/, as in ago.  I was happily surprised to see Robert Forester in the role of private eye.  Other actors did very well, too.  The crime story is the main plot.  But, the secondary plot has a wonderful message:  when a person is trying to work through the grieving process, it is important to ask the right question.  Don't ask, Why did my loved one/s die?  Instead, ask, Since I am still alive, what can I do to be an instrument-of-righteousness for God, to the benefit others in need?  In this case, a man who had lost his wife and two sons used his passion for the truth, and skills he had perfected in his work as an attorney, to help an innocent young man, who looked very guilty.",1369180800,,1489,4.419117647058823

What I did find interesting is that, when a movie is God centered or faith centered it is a bore, bad acting, waste of time etc.. It is very strange how when a faith based movie is made, no one wants to support the movie or give the movie great reviews.

 I said this to say that it is a shame that this movie did not receive the exposure it should have. This was a great movie as my family and I just finished watching the movie and I could not wait to write a review about the movie in support of this movie and hopefully many more faith based movies to come.

If you are thinking of viewing this movie, you will not be disappointed. We viewed this movie with clear minds. We left the movie touched and filled with the message that this movie sends.. If you want a clean, faith based, mystery then this movie is for you. It is based on a book by a great author who writes great books..

The movie was professional quality, touching, clean, great family entertainment and an ending that will knock you off of your feet and leaving you wondering who can you trust.

View this movie for yourself and then make your own judgement as to if it is a good movie are not. But before you state your response, ask yourself what do you value, did this movie feed your spirit man? Did you get the message of this movie.

Christians can have clean fun and make decent movies without all of the guns, violence, and drugs etc. Remember what you put in your gates, eye, ears, etc is what will come out. Give your soul some food for thought with this clean christian movie.

It's such a mundane, poorly written and acted, unrealistic, empty, and uninteresting retread of a trial movie that I have to suspect some of the contributors of moderate-to-good reviews have an interest in promoting the movie.

I loved the secretary, because her cheerful, joking personality was a welcome contrast to the lawyer and investigator who both seemed rather depressed and lacking purpose(rightly so, since they had lost a mutual loved one).

Its been a few years since I read the book, but from what I recollect I felt like the movie stayed true to the story.  However, the book was so lengthy and detailed (in a good way), that the movie didn't seem long enough or have enough detail to it.  I would have liked to see more of the investigation, following leads, the evidence, etc. Then again, Whitlow's writing generally focuses on the characters and their lives more than the actual investigations and criminal procedings, so in all fairness its probably just me wishing for the details and not that the moviemakers actually left anything significant out.",1294963200,,1159,4.611650485436893

The problem for the defendant is he can't remember the event. He claims he would never have killed the girl because he loved her. But is he telling the truth or is the amnesia just a clever ploy?

The Trial stars Matthew Modine (Memphis Belle, What the Deaf Man Heard) as attorney Mac who is depressed because his family has been killed in a car accident.

Bob Gunton (Patch Adams, 24) plays the prosecution seeking the death penalty.

And Randy Wayne (To Save A Life) plays Pete Thomason: the accused.

It wasn't Oscar material or movie of the year, but it wasn't meant to be.  It was made to make you think, and for us it worked just fine.

Have you ever been ""set up"" and framed?  Have you ever taken the rap for someone else?  Felt like your life was hanging on the edge, and you didn't know why? The defendant in this movie did.  You always had the feeling like he was innocent from the begining, but you had your doubts, and when the climax came into play you knew why.

Come into this movie with an open mind.  Don't let other peoples negativity cloud your own judgement.

4249470,2,B0042DN4XG,"There is a bigger evil in the film industry besides sex and violence. It is bad scripts and bad acting. This is a faith-based movie designed for young Christian audiences. This review contains some early plot points, but seriously, nothing can spoil this film. Mac is a lawyer who lost his wife and two sons on Christmas Eve. So he does what all men do when that happens. He quits his job and puts a loaded gun to his head. Mac is suddenly saved by the bell when the phone rings. He is ordered by a judge to take a murder case in a small Georgia town that has 3 black people and 4 people with mixed southern accents. An evil big city prosecutor from Atlanta is coming to town. Mac assembles his crack team to help him. Mindy, a perky waitress, who makes helpful suggestions like getting an answering machine for the office, and his dead wife's brother who is part time woodsman and part time investigator. Together they go and investigate the murder uncovering simple pieces of evidence that should have been revealed in any criminal investigation, such as an eye witness who saw two cars the night of the murder and one of them hit his truck. Mac has the accused murderer meet with a female shrink, who also runs a clinic to help people cope with the grief of a loved one through God. Why? Because she was lost her husband. Her 10 year old son shows Mac that you can go on with life as they play catch. Mom had tried to teach the kid to throw a baseball by reading from a book. If this sounds hokey, it is. The courtroom has a huge copy of the 10 commandments displayed behind the witness stand which the camera occasionally zeros in on.

The script was extremely bad. Anyone who has seen one Perry mason episode could not have written such horrific court scenes. First, based upon the real lack of evidence, the case should have never had gone to trial. There was no real investigation into the murder. The evidence presented by the first witness should not had been allowed and even though the defense had a witness list, his testimony was a complete surprise!

Watching this film was like watching a train wreak. I kept wanting to turn away, but kept expecting something to happen. No sex, nudity, or bad language, just the proverbial bad uncle who made a pass at his niece. Two stars is generous.",1292630400,2,2301,4.4373522458628845
