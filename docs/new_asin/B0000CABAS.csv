7998606,5,B0000CABAS,"This review refers to the ""Clint Eastwood - Hero"" DVD 3-pack by Warner Bros(10/03
release)....

So... what does an aging master thief, a rough, gruff Gunnery
Sgt, and a seasoned Texas Ranger have in common? Well...Clint of course!  All
three of these films found in this 'hero' collection, which include ""Absolute
Power"",""Heartbreak Ridge"" and ""A Perfect World"", are must haves for Eastwood
fans. These are three of his works that really show off his expertise in front of
and behind the camera as these were all directed by him as well. They also
include some of the best talent in Hollywood as Clint has a knack for
surrounding himself with the finest actors.

""Absolute Power"" from 1997 is the
newest of the trio. It's a terrific thriller that will have you on the edge of
your seat as Clint goes up against some mighty powerful enemies. He is an aging
master thief, and while in the process off pulling of the ultimate job,
witnesses a murder. And this murder involves the most powerful man in the world.
When Clint is the chief suspect, he must prove that the blood trail leads all
the way to the Whitehouse. Not an easy task for our guy, as he is being persued
by all sides. The film is multi-faceted as it also let's us in on this thief's
softer side as he tries to build a relationship with his estranged daughter. A
huge cast includes, Ed Harris, Gene Hackman, Laura Linney, Scott Glenn,Judy
Davis, Dennis Haysbert and the great E.G. Marshall.

""Heartbreak Ridge"" from 1986 is Eastwood's tough guy image personified. He is Gunnery Sgt. Tom ""Gunny"" Highway. Gunny has seen it all, and done it all. He's a decorated war hero who
has survived battle in both Korea and Vietnam. He's tough and gruff and will soon
face mandatory retirement. With no war to fight his last assignment is to whip
the members of a raw but feisty recon platoon into shape. He's up against an
unwilling group, a ""follow orders or else""(not exactly his style)type commanding
officer, and an ex-wife who's as feisty as the recruits. Both he and his men(and
his ex-wife) are put to the test when war breaks out on the Island of Grenada.
Marsha Mason co-stars and the cast is nicely rounded out by Mario VanPeebles,
Moses Gunn, Bo Svenson and the wonderful Eileen Heckart.

Completeing this trio in the 'Hero' series is a film from 1993,""A Perfect World"". Fans will more
appreciate the director side of Eastwood in this one. He's a seasoned Texas
Ranger who is in pursuit of an dangerous escaped convict who has kidnapped a
small boy for a hostage. Kevin Costner is Haynes, the elusive fugitive and it his
work in the film that is really showcased here. It's superbly acted by Costner,
and beautifully directed by Eastwood. It's more than just a statewide cops and
robbers chase, as the character development, and the past play a big part as the
film progresses. Laura Dern also stars and the performance by T.J. Lowther the
young actor who plays Phillip, the kidnap victim, is absolutely incredible.

This DVD boxed set is a great deal. Each in their own snap-case,
they all present a very good picture, clear with nice color(Absolute Power is
outstanding), in widescreen formats with 'AP' also giving the choice of a
standard format, and all are in Dolby Dig 5.1 Surround sound. All the action and
the wonderful musical scores, all composed by Lennie Niehaus sound
fabulous. There's not much in the way of special features. Theatrical trailers
and some cast bios. All have subtitles in English, French and Spanish. 'AP' has
some production notes. Makes a great gift; those who love Clint
will love this package, so go ahead and make their day!

Enjoy and Happy Trails.....Laurie",1067040000,,3657,4.722570532915361
