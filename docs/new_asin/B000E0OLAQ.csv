8103385,3,B000E0OLAQ,"Everyone wrote great reviews. This is an hour & 15 min workout dvd set in a gym with 4 girls & 1 guy behind D. The music is a basic beat & not inspiring & makes it more boring. The screen flashs the name of the move each time.
D's relaxed & friendly, but moves VERY unenthusiastically which isn't an inspiration. She gives good cues, not just counts to help you remember which is great.
What bothered me was the camera work. It moves all around, crazy, zooming here & there with no plan. Sometimes as well the video will be split into 2 or 3 windows which made it hard for me to focus on only one dancer or whoever is showing the most enthusiasm at the time. Since D moves lazilly a bit, I try to focus on the guy since he showed the most enjoyment & really gets into the moves to make them look as good as they are & maybe 1 or 2 other girls.
Warm-up - 6 min
Fast paced, many stretches for knees, hips, shoulders, torso
Part 1 - 28 min
She repeats all new moves about 10x & then the routine as much as you learned each time another 10x. She doesn't go 1/2 speed or break it down, but since the moves are very easy, this isn't a problem to follow... except the damn crazy camera moving making you almost seasick.
Part 2 - Aerobics - 30 min
This part she at first still repeats 10x then as she goes on repeats it less. The moves here are better, actually some cool, but I still try to focus on the guy & backup girls & the camera is still killing me.
Abs - 10 min
On the mat, basic crunches, sit ups, toe reaches, etc.

If it wasn't for the camera work, I'd give this 4 stars for the aerobics section. I love repetition since that helps with muscle memory, but 10x is excessive. I'd be happy with 4-6x even with complex moves.
This is only for those looking for a light aerobic workout & loves repetition even with crazy cameras.

8103386,1,B000E0OLAQ,"D is supposed to be a great choreographer and energetic leader? Where was she? The instructor on this DVD had low energy, and her moves are unbelievably bad. The camerawork was not great either, we need to see what the feet are doing at the same time we see what the upper body is doing. UGH!",1197504000,,292,4.232142857142857
8103387,1,B000E0OLAQ,"This workout is difficult to follow, and the filming itself is amatuer and poorly done. It is difficult to follow the moves, has excessive repetition while teaching it and doesn't really give a very good workout. I do NOT reccommend.",1179014400,,233,4.85
8103388,2,B000E0OLAQ,"I found this video challenging...the first time i did it. Then it just got repetitive. While you do breakm a sweat, she only teaches you eight moves and the background music is not fly. They seem to repeat moves over and over and then surprise: its over. If I hadn't paid so little for it I would want my money back.",1169510400,,316,4.19672131147541
8103389,5,B000E0OLAQ,Surprised at workout- great variety compared to other hip hop workout  videos: a nice change with some new moves for even a seasoned workout video watcher. Felt like I didn't have to add any more after the workout. Great supplement to another dance routine for toning.,1165276800,3,268,4.826086956521739
8103390,5,B000E0OLAQ,"This DVD works perfectly for me and my friends!

We have some much fun doing the rountines and learn club moves that we vote it 5 stars Aerobics! I've been looking for a good workout video for awhile. My problem, I get bored. I've tried yoga and pilates and just couldn't stick with it. I've tried other dance type videos and just could not stand the instructor. This is a good video since it doesn't try to give you too much choreography so that you can put a little of yourself into the dance and have some fun. The instructor is not annoying and doesn't talk too much. Overall, a good video for people who needed to be entertained even when they are working out.

Definately I recommend it for everyone.....",1162857600,4,710,4.412213740458015
8103391,1,B000E0OLAQ,"I picked up this DVD because I wanted to learn how to dance hip hop.  Even being a complete beginner, I found this DVD to be extremely boring.  It is very slow paced and not at all what I expected.",1138060800,5,197,3.9
8103392,3,B000E0OLAQ,"This DVD, which runs about 45 minutes (50 minutes including the informational/promotional introducation), was fun but didn't do much in terms of giving me a workout.  D is a good instructor, building at a fairly slow pace on a dance routine up until the last fifteen minutes, in which she adds to the routine more quickly, but except for beginning exercisers the moves and the pace are not going to raise many heart-rates.  D is also not a chirpy, high-energy instructor; she has a cool NY vibe that is quite different from many aerobic workout DVDs.  The camera work leaves something to be desired in terms of following the steps (often focusing on only the upper bodies, when the feet would be more helpful), but the routine is repetitive enough that after the first time through the workout that isn't too much of a problem.  In summary, the ""workout"" is good for learning the routine, but not aerobic for any other than beginning exerciser.  Buy it if you are starting out in exercise, or your want to see what it is like to learn a dance routine, but not if you are looking for an intermediate or advanced aerobic video.",1137974400,10,1125,4.605
