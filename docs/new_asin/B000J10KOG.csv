8181108,4,B000J10KOG,I just wanted to add this to my small collection for the holidays.  I do enjoy the different versions of The Christmas Carol and Scrooge.  I am glad to own it.,1383696000,,159,4.096774193548387
8181109,3,B000J10KOG,"An interesting oldie! I actually enjoy the ""old"" stage acting..you may like it.. Although you may hate it. Watch it and find out for yourself. I gave it 3 stars, because Vincent Price deserves at least that.",1355011200,,207,4.621621621621622
8181110,1,B000J10KOG,"I liked Vincent Price's reading of The Christmas Carol, and if it had been just that, I'd probably give it 5 stars.  But the acting of the scenes with Scrooge is just plain bad, and Marley is a joke.  At first I thought it would be too short, but I was glad I didn't have to sit through a longer version with the horrible acting.

A Picture of Magi was just plain boring and failed to hold my attention, but I'll probably watch it again some time, to give it another chance.",1353801600,,474,4.130434782608695
