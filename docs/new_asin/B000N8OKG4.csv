8175552,5,B000N8OKG4,"Mike Clark is one of the main people that created that ""Oakland"" sound, together with people like the great David Garibaldi and a few others. He is a true legend in his craft. His drumming is always innovative, not the patterny thing people sometimes associate with funk, but a more evolving drum line, where he creatively improvises with the pattern, never losing the groove for a split second, but on the contrary enriching it all the time. You can actually see this at work in the video, in quite a few settings, including all kinds of funk grooves and blues, shuffle and what-have-you.

It is not a video for the beginner, in the sense that it doesn't tell you how to hold the stick and count your 16ths or triplets. You have to know some drums and some music in general, and know a few things about Mike's musical whereabouts to appreciate what is going on. However, if you are up to a level, you can't afford to miss it if you are serious about drumming, no matter what you play. There is simply too much info to miss...",1334188800,2,1026,4.428571428571429
8175553,5,B000N8OKG4,"If you're looking to learn funk, this is the guy to look for. Highly known for his grooves in Herbie Hancock's band, The Headhunters, Mike looks to share his influences, technique and overall mood he portrays whenever he starts to create the beat. His other lessons on blues and swing are also killer. It's all about the sound, and Clark definitely knows that! One of my inspirations, this is definitely something worthwhile! Get it!",1277596800,4,433,4.864864864864865
