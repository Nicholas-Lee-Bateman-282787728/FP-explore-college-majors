8156061,5,B000KF0GSG,"We love the Wubbulous World series.  The characters are Dr. Seuss wacky, and many are well known from the stories (such as Horton, the Cat in the Hat, Sam I Am).  Each video has several vignettes, with silly songs and lots of action.  Each vignette has a moral, that is subtle yet worthwhile.  The videos appeal to parents due to the clean language and subject matter.  They appeal to boys and girls ages 3-8 due to funny puppets, voices, and situations.",1276992000,,454,4.555555555555555
8156062,5,B000KF0GSG,"I really liked this DVD. Actually, I love all of the Wubbulous World DVDs. My favorite episode on this one was about a cat that spoke a different language and how people all speak different languages. I thought it was a great way to show the kids that even though they all spoke differently, it doesn't mean you can't be friends.",1260403200,,329,4.409836065573771
8156063,5,B000KF0GSG,"After the moderately horrid movie adaptation of Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, I despaired of Geisel's books or characters ever being successfully translated into other media. This series has proved me gratefully mistaken.

We recieved four of the Wubbulous World DVDs as a gift; I had never seen the television show, so I had no idea what to expect.  I was delighted that the shows provide thoughtful, educational themes while still maintaining the silly Seussian aesthetic. The visuals, the language, the plots and the pacing are all engaging for ages 4-8 (though my 3-yr-old, who knows the books, loves these videos too).

I could provide more series details, but the quality of the four videos we have is remarkably even; I presume that all the discs in this series will be high-quality entertainment for your little Seuss fans.",1228435200,2,845,5.021428571428571
