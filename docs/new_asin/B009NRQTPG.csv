5358018,4,B009NRQTPG,"I don't personally see David Geffen in that much of a positive light as I see him as a powerful tool of the establishment (The major record labels, Clear Channel etc) I loathe, the axis of power controlling large chunks of the entertainment industry. But I cannot argue that he has an interesting story and a lot of accomplishments that got him there. The American Masters series in general is great and I have viewed a few of them on PBS.",1353628800,4,439,4.432098765432099
5358019,5,B009NRQTPG,"Inventing David Geffen is an exceptionally well-made documentary which will be of interest to a very wide audience given the scope of its subject matter as well as the compelling individual at the center of its narrative focus. Wonderfully engaging and entertaining, the film is balanced in its viewpoint and granular in its highly detailed profile of a life that encompasses a broad swath of the American cultural scene over the last forty years. To my taste, Inventing David Geffen is one of the finest biographical documentaries of the last decade and I highly recommended it.",1353628800,7,579,5.041666666666667

5358027,5,B009NRQTPG,"Extremely well made, insightful and entertaining look into the life of a Media Mogul. What I found interesting was his unrelenting drive for success all the while being praised for his heart and humanity. Yes, he did some cold blooded things like sue Neil Young, but he leaves a lasting legacy of developing some of the greatest artists in musical history. In the end, his ambition was not motivated bu greed, but by the music.",1420329600,,427,4.706666666666667

5358038,5,B009NRQTPG,"Excellent biographical documentary about David Geffen.  I knew very little about David Geffen.  I came away very impressed by his life story, his philosophy and his accomplishments.  I was also very impressed by the number of stars and media moguls who appeared in this documentary.  It's not that he became a billionaire within 30 years altho his achievements are, of course, part of the story.  His life and career focused on the creators, the musicians, singers and songwriters, and their careers and successes.  During his career, he grew, professionally and personally.  I did not know the song, Free Man in Paris, (Joni Mitchell) was about him.  I also did not know he was gay or that his parents were immigrants.  I had heard the mailroom story.  You will see the early singer/songwriter scene in NYC and LA from Laura Nyro to Joni MItchell, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Jackson Browne, the Eagles, Sunset Strip to Dream Girls in NYC and ending with Dreamworks with Speilberg and Katzenberg.  Quite an arc and quite a man.",1408579200,,1023,4.855491329479769

5358041,5,B009NRQTPG,"I actually knew very little about Geffen's early years in the music business-my knowledge of him was his involvement with Spielberg and Katzenberg in the Dreamworks studio.
He has had an amazing career-putting together and or managing some of the big names of the 60;s, 70, 80 and 90's.\ Eagles, Byrds, Joni MItchell,Crosby Stills Nash and Young. Good friends with John and Yoko.

5358043,5,B009NRQTPG,"Incredibly informative, well-done documentary about an American entertainment mogul.  This documentary does a great job examining Geffen's motives, heart, vision, and personality.  Geffen himself comes across as affable, candid, self-aware, and at the same time, very vulnerable.  This is an excellent portrait of a highly-driven man who has a knack for accurately identifying audience's tastes.  Despite his business acumen, he is nonetheless very human.  It's hard not to be sympathetic toward a man who wears his whole self on his sleeve.  No, Geffen is not the epitome of a role model; however, while watching this, a lot can be learned about how driven, ambitious, and wilfull visionaries affect others' lives in both positive and negative ways.  I'm very glad I watched this.  Fascinating person!",1405555200,,802,5.411290322580645

5358045,5,B009NRQTPG,David Geffen has always intrigued me.  I read a lot about his accomplishments but never was able to find much to read about him.

5358046,5,B009NRQTPG,"I've watched this documentary several times. It's so well done, I had to have it.

What a superb character study. What a character! Geffen is fascinating, sharp, complex, introspective, damaged, powerful, and a work of Art in himself. Nothing less. Truly.

It's the music and recording artists presented here that I already knew; the man behind the wave of the singer/songwriter movement that I've now become familiar with. I'm so glad I did. I have so much respect for him and what he's accomplished both professionally and personallywhat he's overcome.

Every Artist needs a Geffen.

I'm glad our world has him. I recommend you find out why. Watch this fine, fine piece.",1403049600,,672,4.973214285714286

5358054,5,B009NRQTPG,"A very interesting documentary of the legendary David Geffen. Given Mr. Geffen's personal involvement, the story might be considered a little one sided especially as at least one of those being interviewed has his own stories about ""rags to riches"" scenarios e.g., own baggage viz a viz the demise of MCA Records with dubious members of ""the Network"" (see William Knoedelseder's ""Stiffed""  Harper Collins, 1993 and Fredric Dannen's ""Hit Men"" Times Books, 1990).

5358055,5,B009NRQTPG,"Inventing David Geffen is a tour de force!  Having known ""of"" him for many years, I never really knew much ""about"" him.  This film is not only about him, but about practically every big star in rock and roll music from the 1970s and 80s, who David Geffen discovered, worked with, promoted...  The film includes these stars and their music and is a wonderful retrospective.  Then it continues with Geffen's second act.  Inspiring and fascinating!",1393200000,,445,4.88
5358056,5,B009NRQTPG,"I took a chance on this one, and glad I did.  I started out thinking it would be another Hollywood mogul story, but I was pleasantly surprised very soon into the movie.  I guess I hadn't been paying enough attention to Geffen over the years to know how much his genius has influenced our culture; there were several Who Knew? moments throughout.  And as much as I had initially expected to dislike him, it was very difficult to do so in the long run.  Geffen is seen here as a brilliant, complex, flawed, but strangely endearing person.
This film is very well produced and has the added bonus of all the wonderful music that Geffen himself made possible.",1393027200,,654,4.516949152542373
5358057,5,B009NRQTPG,I enjoyed seeing this documentary again.  I first saw it on KPBS and was glad to see that Amazon offered it on its prime service.  I remember as a boy listening to the Eagles greatest hits ALBUM.  It was great to hear one great song after another.  David Geffen recognizing artists gave us the opportunity for great music that we may not have ever heard.,1391990400,,354,4.4

5358060,4,B009NRQTPG,"Inventing David Geffen was a fantastic documentary about a billionaire that has probably influenced most Americans but whom most Americans have probably never heard about. Geffen is a classic entrepreneur, and has also lived among and influenced the rich and famous elite entertainers in Hollywood.

5358070,2,B009NRQTPG,"Oh yeah, what an upstanding American success story.  Really something to admire.  Got his start by forging his academic credentials and lying on his resume. Then lied and manipulated his way further up the proverbial ladder.  Felt ""devastated and crushed"" that his singer-songwriter protege, Laura Nyro screwed him over by going to Columbia Records, only to turn around and do the same thing to his ""family"" of artists at Asylum Records when he traded his artistic and personal integrity for corporate power and control. (And that's only the beginning.) Right. Just how we want all our children to ""make it"" in this world.  Because we all know that the ends justifies the means...right?

Read that he lives a lavish and self-indulgent lifestyle--complete with yachts and mansions, and has 41-years-his-junior ""boy toys."" And we are supposed to admire this 69-year-old boy-child who is clearly long on smarts and pathetically short on scruples...and morals?  A man who has been dubbed ""ruthless"" and ""self serving.""  Because what?  He puts together big Hollywood deals? Was a mentor to rock stars? ""Was born confident."" Values the almighty dollar and being a big power player above everything else?  Is charming?  Really?",1385337600,13,1220,5.21025641025641
5358071,4,B009NRQTPG,"What an interesting life.  From total obscurity to power mogul. Only in America. Timing, as they say, is everything. In the case of Geffen, timing and Brooklyn chutzpah. I was/am a fan of Laura Nyro. To hear the story of Geffen's involvement with Ms. Nyro, was worth the price of the admission. I had no idea that Geffen was a real force in the lives of so many of the artists I personally respect and listen to, to this day. Would they have been what they became without Geffen....not hard to say at all...unequivocally NO! While some question the role of talent agents, Geffen was more to these folks. And even though, like them, he evolved and to them became the very thing he started out being the antithesis to, individuals of vision, by nature, cannot remain the same. The most fascinating segments of this film, are Geffen talking about himself and his perceived limitations: no talent, dyslexic, fatherless, short, Jewish...on and on, but what drive, persistence and dreams. This is a life lesson. Talent is a dime a dozen, IQ is highly overrated, give us the ones who WILL!",1384819200,,1082,4.6947368421052635

5358073,4,B009NRQTPG,"I have always been fascinated by Hollywood, enamored you might say.  David Geffen is the shinning example of what a Hollywood mogul really is, or seems to be.  It is hard to believe that he has been on the very top of the music business, the movies industry and even Broadway.  This story makes his life sound almost perfect, at least from a business perspective.  He almost always succeeded, with only a couple of mentioned setbacks, e.g. working at Warner Records and actually having to report to someone, which it seems he failed miserably at, and Geffen Records was initially struggling to survive post his huge success with Asylum Records, which is how he ended up at Warner.

As a person he seems to have integrity and great character, most of the time at least, nurturing his artists even if they were not initially successful...but then again he ends up suing Niel Young, which makes him look more interested in money than in the ""art"" (although why Niel was creating some very questionable records at the time, i.e. Transformer and a rockabilly album).  He was not above lying when he needed to (such as when he misrepresented his educational background and job experience when applying for a job at the Morris Agency), but he is primarily thought of as a guy with great integrity.

All in all a very good movie about Hollywood, the music industry and how an individual can succeed against the odds with determination, confidence and relentless drive to be the best.  A prime example of how the truth can be even more fascinating than fiction. Highly recommended.",1384214400,,1572,4.7749077490774905
5358074,3,B009NRQTPG,"I had heard of David Geffen for years.  This film tells the story.  I think this is the guy that has pretty much managed to change state law by successfully denying public access to the beaches around Malibu.  Anyway, most of us can be glad we don't have to live next door, or do business with him.  Definitely strikes me as 'the end justifies the means...', type.",1384214400,2,364,4.388059701492537

What I was not aware of was his direct influence on some of the greatest movies of the 80's.  This is an amazing documentary of an amazing man.",1382054400,,436,3.9318181818181817

5358089,5,B009NRQTPG,"A very well done documentary with remarkable candor by the subject. It illustrates a life dedicated to enablement of a dream (his own) through tapping into the dreams of others.  This appears to have been a largely constructive exercise for those around him, creating a larger canvas with shrewd business acumen ""you will be rich, but I will be richer"". Not a bad trade-off or necessarily unjust, but like most american moguls who build the machinery of commerce, regardless if it is oil, railroads or great music and film; personal vision is paramount with its own code of conduct and laws of gravity. Cheers and good viewing.",1375142400,2,627,4.859813084112149
5358090,4,B009NRQTPG,"I enjoyed this documentary.  I did not know the history of some of the groups/people, such as how Jackson Brown got his start, how that led to David Geffen starting his own label.  It was a bit too self congratulatory for my own taste.  It did have a bit of the negative the underside.  I am supposing that people like Neil Young would likely not have wanted to be interviewed for this documentary given the history, but a bit more from the people involved in those sorts areas of his life would have been great.  But overall - highly recommended - especially for anyone who likes the singer/songwriter genre of music. I also did not know about Jackson Brown's Song for Adam - such a beautiful song - on heavy rotation on one of my Spotify lists right now.",1373932800,,756,4.410071942446043
5358091,4,B009NRQTPG,I wasn't sure what to expect since I knew nothing about this music giant.  His story is motivational to anyone developing their career.  I'm finding two common threads among all highly successful people:  They work extremely hard and are relentless in what they are pursuing.,1372550400,,275,5.066666666666666
5358092,5,B009NRQTPG,Quite a story of a college drop out.  Great interviews and a candid David Geffen  make a 5 star video.  BILL MUELLER,1372291200,,116,4.181818181818182
5358093,5,B009NRQTPG,Great doc about David Geffen. Lots of stuff about Laura Nyro and Joni Mitchell. A must for their fans. Skip the part about the boring Eagles. This doc even has Yoko and Cher! Geffen def knew his stuff. I highly reccomend this DVD.,1365120000,,230,4.372093023255814
5358094,5,B009NRQTPG,"""Inventing David Geffen"" (2012 release; 115 min.) is a PBS documentary in the on-going ""American Masters"" series, in which we get a look at the life and times of David Geffen.

The documentary's fisrt hour is nothing short of thrilling, as we see young Geffen, born and raised in Brooklyn, with one goal in mind: go out to California and become part of the Hollywood scene. As Geffen comments (in the many face-to-face interviews with him in this): ""I left for California the day I graduated from high school"". After some detours, Geffen starts his career at the William Morris talent agency and takes a strong (some might say, obsessed) interest in Laura Nyro, a talented singer-wongwriter. Geffen eventually founded Asylum Records, where he nurtures bands like the Eagles. Comments Glenn Frey: ""he said to me, I'm gonna make you rich, but I'll be richer"", ha! Geffen's drive and ambition knows no or little boundaries, and he dabbles in Hollywood again, only to come back and found Geffen Records, which he eventually sells for meagabucks, leading into his co-founding of the Dreamworks movie studio.

The documentary also looks at his personal life, being a gay man yet getting into an 18 month relationship with Cher in the 70s (before she dumps him for Greg Allman), and his later 'officially' coming out and then being a strong supporter of gay rights. Leaving the personal life aside, this movie is fascinating to watch for Geffen's work both in the music and the movie industries. I enjoyed this documentary from start to finish. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1364342400,,1557,4.938931297709924

5358097,5,B009NRQTPG,"If you're interested in a story about someone who simply willed success, this is it. What a story. Iwas spellbound, all 3 times. Plus, Geffen was at the center of the renaissance of music in the '60's, even facilitated it really. So if you're interested in how that amazing era of music came about you'll be fascinated by this film.",1360713600,,332,4.55

5358099,5,B009NRQTPG,"I happened to catch Inventing David Geffen on my local PBS station and I couldn't stop laughing at the gall of this Jew from a poor Brooklyn family. The program was interesting with great graphics and lots of good music. I decided that I had to get the blu-ray.
I learned early on that Geffen was gay. When he fell in love with Cher I almost fell out of my chair. Next I saw how he helped his clients as an agent. We meet his friends (would you believe Steven Spielberg?) and learn a lot more about him. He makes some good deals that make him a lot of money. He goes from making records to making movies. He becomes a major player in Hollywood.
I am still laughing. This is one of the best blu-rays I have. I think I will enjoy Inventing David Geffen for a long time to come.
Try it, you'll like it.",1357948800,4,799,4.095541401273885

8543222,5,B009NRQTPG,Nice seeing David manipulate a world he knew nothing of to become a billionaire. Sad they didn't show a bit more info on how he manipulated people to get ahead yet focused on how heartbroken he was over things that had happened to him. Showbiz the place where truth is manufactured to the point where so much info is lost. Would like to have seen how the lesser known people did after their deals with David.

The music alone makes this a worthwhile purchase. Eagles, Jackson Brown, Neil Young, David Crosby, Joni Mitchell . . . if that's your sound track this will bring it all back . . . and then there are the movies to numerous to mention.
