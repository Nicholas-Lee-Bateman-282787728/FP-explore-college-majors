7000948,5,B00T6KIL2E,Always a favorite when nothing else is going on.  I have been faithful watching each episode of each season premiere.  I also couldn't wait for a series set (hopefully) so I have every season so far on dvd.  Usually they release the newest season on disc near the newest season for premiere.  It's a great way to have annual marathons for catching up.  Awesome catch phrases for use in everyday moments.,1446076800,,403,4.619718309859155

7000950,5,B00T6KIL2E,Archer gets back on track here after a disappointing season 5. Not a bad episode in the set. Hilarious!,1443830400,,103,4.473684210526316

7000953,5,B00T6KIL2E,"Archer is by far the funniest animated comedy on TV.  Too bad they had to change the name of their spy agency ISIS - International Secret Intelligence Service - because of the terror group with the same acronym.

Cannot recommend Archer highly enough.",1434931200,21,251,4.813953488372093
7000954,5,B00T6KIL2E,"Caught one random ""latest episode"" during season 6 as it aired and I was flipping channels.  I had no context and had never seen any episodes of Archer before.  I laughed through the whole episode.  After it ended, the channel aired some other episode which I assume was the next episode in the ""we play all of the episodes that exist over and over in order"".  I had no context for that either, it wasn't even remotely chronologically accurate with the episode I'd just watched, and I laughed through the whole episode.  I loved them so much I immediately ordered all the seasons I could buy on Blu-ray (at the time I write this that was seasons 1-5 and a pre-order on season 6).

Highly recommend this series to any adult that loves laughing and being entertained.",1434499200,42,765,4.547445255474453

7000956,5,B00T6KIL2E,"Archer is back for his most fun season yet. Archer Vice was fun, but now the crew is back to form. They're working for the government again, Pam is back to being fat, and Cherlyne is once again Cheryl (although ISIS is no longer ISIS). I really can't say enough good things about this season of Archer. I feel like the show just keeps topping itself. Archer is better than Family Guy, South Park, and The Simpsons all put together.",1424822400,32,431,4.4

7000989,5,B00T6KIL2E,I was up late one night watching FX and it came on and I've been laughing and watching this series ever since. This is an adult tv series with vulgar langauge. There suppose to be spys but that's debateable with Lana and Archer always fighting and then making up by having sex. Tune in nights at midnight and laugh yourself to sleep. The series has been renewed through season 10 and the creator Adam Reed is calling it quits.,1494806400,,426,4.405063291139241

7001061,2,B00T6KIL2E,"Well, I was an 'early adopter' of this show... and only watched it on disc; buying each of them as they became available. Then I had to wait forever to get this one. It was a total letdown. You get the feeling that the corporate owners were encouraging the writers/producers to make it as NOT funny and NOT deep as possible... possibly even basing their bonuses on how bad they could make it. The first 5 seasons it was witty. Having had family members who are SEALS and others who beat SEALS up and take their toys... I ... well, lets just say I got a lot of the jokes in the first few seasons others might have missed. THIS ONE was crap.",1476921600,,639,4.203252032520325

7001106,3,B00T6KIL2E,"The Crew that produces this series sure has lost their way. Their annimation is still really great, but EVERYTHING ELSE has been so basterdized from their first three seasons that it's honestly difficult to tell it's the same show.  What THEY REALLY NEED TO DO IS HIRE SOME PROFESSIONAL WRITERS (actual comedians), LOSE THE CREEPY KID (preferably through Lana's gross negligence - - - gets it killed!),  LOSE THE INFANTILE GROTESQUE NOISES (vomiting, belching, gulping, crying, farting, high-pitched ringing, etc.),  RETURN  STERLING TO HIS ORIGINAL CHARACTER,  and GIVE THAT RAGING LOONATIC IDIOT ""CAROL""  A LOT MORE AIR TIME.

7001200,4,B00T6KIL2E,"If not quite up to the brilliant consistency of the 5th season (at least for me), this is still one of the very funniest and most inventive shows on television, animated or not.  Archer is now a father, which is a pretty frightening concept when you consider he is mostly nothing more than a giant, horny, alcoholic, self-obsessed walking id.  But the great trick of this series has somehow making him just likable, vulnerable and human enough that we actually care, and wish him well.  Credit very sharp writing, and a terrific voice performance by H. Jon Benjamin.

What was a bit off for me this season was it was more Archer/Lana centric.  And while they are terrific characters, I have found I get the biggest laughs from the truly surreal, often raunchy and sometimes delightfully disgusting antics of the supporting 'players'.  This season, overall, Pam, Cheryl, Krieger et al got a little less screen time, a little less chance to steal whole episodes with hysterical sub-plots that make you simultaneously laugh out loud, and shake your head that, yes, my god, they actually went there.

Again, this is more personal preference than any pretense of objectivity.  But this year I only laughed loud enough to wake up my sweet, patient wife every 2nd or 3rd episode.  Last year it seemed like every episode she'd hear me trying to suppress my giggles, turn to me with a sleepy smile and say 'Archer again?' before going back to sleep.",1459900800,5,1440,4.774193548387097

7001203,5,B00T6KIL2E,First of all I for this item the day after I ordered it with regular prime shipping so that's freakishly impressive. I'm a huge archer fan I didn't love season five as much as the other seasons so I'm glad season six is back to the normal show format. Anyone who loves adult cartoons needs to watch archer asap!

7001223,5,B00T6KIL2E,"Archer IS the worlds greatest secret agent, and season six restores Archer to doing what he does best; getting himself in in trouble with guns, liquor, prostitutes and his on-again, off-again (smokin' hot) girlfriend Lana.  Archer is described as ""a vain self-obsessed and quite possibly alcoholic man-whore"" and that's from his MOTHER.  This animated series is laugh-out loud funny.  You'll end up watching each episode twice so you catch all the inside jokes.",1453766400,12,461,5.287671232876712
