6282651,5,B00INJPLQ8,"This movie is a great representation of the Camino de Santiago. I highly recommend Wayfaring to anyone who plans on or is thinking doing the Camino de Santiago, and to those not thinking about walking it the camino Wayfaring is still an informational and awesome watch.

Get it!!",1393372800,,279,4.8125
6282652,5,B00INJPLQ8,"I've seen several representations of the Camino from as diverse sources as Rick Steves to the popular film The Way.  While they capture snippets of the 500 mile long trail, only Herriott's ""Wayfaring"" truly captures the right tone.  For many, it is serious, but never so serious that one doesn't find time for laughter.  For all, it is painful (at one time or another), but never so painful that one can't find time for camaraderie.  Scott Herriott's excellent film captures the spectrum.  I highly recommend it!",1393372800,,512,4.906976744186046
6282653,5,B00INJPLQ8,"This film grabbed my attention right out of the gate. Right from the first few opening shots. I really fell in love with the way this film was shot. What a bunch of wonderful characters! What an amazing journey, with incredible scenery. I laughed, I cheered, and I somewhat came to understand what brings a person to make such a huge decision to walk this 500ml journey. They call it a ""Pilgrimage"". I found by watching the film that indeed it is a pilgrimage. Just a wonderful film.",1393372800,,483,4.5
6282654,5,B00INJPLQ8,"I loved Wayfaring and it really makes me want to hike the Camino.  I loved Wayfaring (like Scott's AT movies) because of the people in the films and the charming way that Scott helps them tell their stories. I have toyed with the Camino hike and Wayfaring really took me there and stoked my interest in travelling abroad.  The scenery was amazing and I loved the interviews with the wonderful cast of pilgrims and those in the villages along the way.

Scott Herriott is a wonderful filmmaker who brings his own sense of adventure and tells his own story without getting in the way of the journeys he seeks to document.  He never takes himself too seriously and the product he creates makes the viewer part of the adventure because he helps us see it through the eyes of ""real people.""

I met Scott on the Appalachian Trail when I was thru-hiking in 2011 and was delighted to be a part of his documentary ""Flip Flop Flippin."" I have watched a lot of trail movies, but this one truly captured the spirit and the love (yes) that makes the AT what it is.  The people are awesome and so is the adventure -- Scott told that story extremely well.

Thanks, Scott, for the Flip Flop Flippin' because it documents an important chapter of my life. Thanks for Wayfaring because I now have a look into my future.",1393372800,2,1299,4.455696202531645
6282655,1,B00INJPLQ8,The absolute worst Camino tale EVER. I have viewed many and this ranks at the bottom... Hollywood!  Ridiculous commentary!  It was a total sham',1481846400,,144,4.958333333333333
6282656,5,B00INJPLQ8,"I just watched ""Wayfaring - A Jaunt along the Camino de Santiago""; 2014 / Adventure, Action, Non-fiction.... on Amazon Prime. I highly recommend it. Do yourself a favor and buy it, rent it, whatever you need to do in order to see it. I laughed, I cried, wanted to go for a walk afterwards. Like all of Scott's films, this one is about the people and the culture of walking, but with the added flavor of European history and religion.
But mainly, the film is about all the people Scott met along the way, the same as his other films, and what they share with each other. Scott Herriott's movies are about what it means to be a free spirit in a world full of humans enslaved by the restrictions and demands placed on them by others.",1477353600,,730,4.335766423357664
6282657,2,B00INJPLQ8,"I just finished walking the Camino.  I wanted to watch this as a memory of my journey.  I found the movie entertaining, but very light.  The focus was on talking with people and not the journey itself or the meaning of the journey.  Some laces were only slightly mentioned and only infrequently was the importance of historic landmarks described.  Perhaps most disapointing was the lack of chronology in the finished product.  The film maker jumped forward to one location and then jumped backwards to another then forward again and then backwards.  For someone who does not know the Camino but is trying to plan, it would be impossible by watching this film,",1472428800,,659,4.830357142857143
6282658,3,B00INJPLQ8,"OK documentary about the Camino.  Would have liked a little more detail about actually walking the trail.  To me, the author seemed like he was more interested in trying to be humorous than showing me what it is actually like walking the Camino.",1472342400,,245,4.674418604651163
6282659,2,B00INJPLQ8,Least favorite Camino movie. Misses the Pilgrimage aspect. Too flippant; more about an aging guy trying to be cool around younger females.,1472083200,,138,5.318181818181818
6282660,4,B00INJPLQ8,Interesting,1468627200,,11,11.0

6282662,5,B00INJPLQ8,I am getting ready to walk the Camino and enjoy watching documentaries and other movies showing others experiences. I have watched it 3 times already.,1465084800,,150,5.04
6282663,1,B00INJPLQ8,Very slow.,1459209600,,10,4.5
6282664,4,B00INJPLQ8,"While I enjoyed the film and the connection that the ""pilgrims"" made with each other (and themselves), it sorta gave the whole venture a pubcrawl feel.  I think you can see Scott finding 'his' Camino by the end.",1458345600,,211,4.552631578947368
6282665,2,B00INJPLQ8,"If I had watched this before my own Camino in 2014, I would never have gone. There is too little of the beauty and peace, and way too much of silly college kids who think it's funny to strip to their underwear or run away from ice cream stores.  There is so much more to the Camino than seen here--if you decide to watch it, please find other documentaries to balance out the lack of depth.",1457827200,2,390,4.131578947368421
6282666,4,B00INJPLQ8,another good job by squatch,1454889600,,27,4.6

6282668,1,B00INJPLQ8,"Painful I-love-me-and-so-should-you schtick.  Seriously, dude couldn't find anyone interesting walking the Camino?  Was that the point of the movie, or was it just budgetary constraints having a sick fling with bad luck?",1449360000,2,220,5.84375
6282669,4,B00INJPLQ8,Enjoyable but would like to have more footage of the areas that were passed through.,1447718400,,84,4.666666666666667

6282673,4,B00INJPLQ8,"For someone with an interest in the Camino hike this gives a good insight into the walk, the people and the cultural experiences along the way.  A simple, documentary that gives you a good impression of what it might be like to do your own jaunt along the Camino",1443657600,,262,4.346938775510204
6282674,5,B00INJPLQ8,Good job.,1441670400,,9,4.0
6282675,5,B00INJPLQ8,"I've watched several movies, youtube videos, online clips of a variety of people traveling the Camino de Santiago and I think this one is more realistic of how thing are on the trail and what to expect if you plan on going.  It shows the good and bad, and how people express their day to day life being on this journey.  5 stars for being authentic!",1440979200,,349,4.2727272727272725
6282676,4,B00INJPLQ8,Good movie,1437436800,,10,4.5

6282679,4,B00INJPLQ8,Like I was there.,1434412800,,17,3.5
6282680,1,B00INJPLQ8,"Seriously the worst movie ever on the Camino de Santiago.  Most of the interviews were trashy, not funny, with people who all seem to come from the same toilet in life.  Please, have some respect for the people and culture of generosity and kindness that makes the Camino a beautiful place to just walk and be in nature and work out things in your life in a non hostile environment.  You can film anywhere Scott and find the partyers and the horny jerks did you really need to spoil the Camino for my $1.99?  Sad stupid movie, don't waste your money, nothing to see here you can't find in any bar or alleyway.",1434326400,12,609,4.3628318584070795
6282681,5,B00INJPLQ8,Loved it!,1433721600,,9,4.0
6282682,1,B00INJPLQ8,"Honestly, what a waste of time. I don't understand what was the purpose of the makers. It was not funny, didn't have great images, didn't have any story as the center of the film.  All the contrary. Disappointed.",1432252800,2,212,4.578947368421052
6282683,4,B00INJPLQ8,Great if you are planning to walk the Camino de Santiago.,1429833600,,57,4.2727272727272725
6282684,5,B00INJPLQ8,"I came across this film when looking to find out more after watching ""The Way!""  I am so glad I did!  I have a new item on my bucket list, after watching this.  I highly recommend this to anyone!!  Thanks Scott for documenting your journey!  I'm now a huge fan.",1429660800,,261,4.14
6282685,5,B00INJPLQ8,Great film! Love the point of view from a real experienced hiker.,1428969600,,65,4.5
6282686,4,B00INJPLQ8,"Pretty good, could have been better.  Totally fell in love with Carlotta, wow!!!  Hope to walk the Way someday.",1428019200,,111,4.7894736842105265
6282687,4,B00INJPLQ8,Made the trip a lot more enjoyable-- Thanks,1406592000,,43,4.5
6282688,5,B00INJPLQ8,"The people in this documentary are fantastic; from young cynical New Yorkers to surfer bros, local shop owners to families from the other side of the world. There are those seeking a party and those seeking a conversation with God. All are on their own spiritual journeys. The documentarian gracefully weaves stories of human kindness, beautiful scenery and lots of humor into a magical eighty minutes of entertainment.",1401494400,,419,5.176470588235294
6282689,4,B00INJPLQ8,"In a well known film, ""The Way,"" Martin Sheen (and son, director Emilio Estevez) introduced millions of Americans to the Camino de Santiago, a popular pilgrimage in Europe that begins in France and traverses Spain to the church many believe houses the remains of Saint James.  In Wayfaring, humorist and outdoor filmmaker Scott Herriott provides his own take on the pilgrimage.  Viewers who have seen his documentaries on the Pacific Crest and Appalachian Trails can probably predict that Herriott's take on the pilgrimage will be somewhat more irreverent than Sheen's, and they would be correct.  Herriott's camera captures naked statues with barnacles in unusual places, a fanatical vegan restaurant owner, a winery with an on trail tap for pilgrims, and interviews with a wide variety of characters hiking the trail, each with different motivations.  Some of these people are pursuing a traditional pilgrimage; others are pursuing suitable mates of the opposite gender.  And Herriott?  He wants to find the essence of the trail.  And like all trails, he sees the essence in the many and varied people who hike it.  In short, this film is not for those seeking a religious experience, though Herriott finds people who clearly experience that.  It is a film that captures a community of walkers and incidentally some of the scenery found in this historic route.

I generally liked the film, though it turned out to be unsuitable for the purposes I purchased it for (I wanted to show my 5th grade students a documentary that introduced them to part of European culture and this film did that a bit too well for ten year old children).  I like the idea that a trail is best captured by examining the culture of those who walk it.  Herriott's style of filmmaking is generally quite different from other documentaries on hiking, which focus more on the ecosytems hikers traverse than on their varied motivations.  For 5 stars, however, I would like a little more of both.  As it stands, however, this is a fine documentary, for adult viewers.  Use with caution for your younger ""wanna be"" hikers.",1399939200,14,2093,4.94
6282690,4,B00INJPLQ8,"I really enjoyed this view of the Camino. Scott knows how to make people feel at ease, and he was able to capture moods, good days, bad days, good wine and bad coffee moments and somehow encapsulate them all into this wonderful jaunt on the Camino de Santiago.

I met Scott when he walked in the albergue where I was helping out, and he quickly charmed me with his stories... I was truly looking forward to seeing the end result of his journey and his film - and I wasn't disappointed. I think the manner in which he includes himself into the story lines make this a more personal movie, and his choice of visual landscapes really give the audience a true taste of  this ancient Camino. Bravo for this fresh look ! This will be one DVD that will be shown often.",1398816000,5,761,4.314685314685315
6282691,2,B00INJPLQ8,"I hate to rate camino movies negatively as I love the Camino and I was really looking forward to seeing this documentary.  Unfortunately, I found it only scratched the surface... It was very American centric and half the subjects seemed to be high on something most of the time...",1396915200,5,280,4.714285714285714
6282692,5,B00INJPLQ8,"As a two time thru-hiker and long distance backpacker extraordinaire, I manage to bore the heck out of my friends and family with frequent AT/PCT tales of yore... Seriously, most hiking media is just awful for anyone who hasn't experienced it themselves. With Squatch's Wayfaring, you can rest easy knowing that your loved ones haven't switched the TV back to Honey Boo Boo as soon as you leave the room.

I loved every second of this! The Spanish culture has been captured wonderfully, and the diverse community present on the trail really make it clear why so many thousands hike the camino every year. As always, Scott provides hilarity, humanity and the brilliant film-making that puts me into a depressive slump each winter; longing for another long distance hike.",1396310400,8,769,4.961240310077519
6282693,5,B00INJPLQ8,"This is a beautifully shot, engaging and hilarious film about the Camino. This film goes much further than your average travel documentary. It's about the places and the history of the Camino (amazing) but also about the people and the varied inspirations that draw people to this trail. I learned about the Camino, I laughed my head off, and I was inspired by the people, history and sights along the way!

A must see for anyone who loves travel, hiking, adventures, and um, laughing!",1395792000,,485,4.773809523809524
6282694,5,B00INJPLQ8,"This gorgeously-filmed documentary is a treat from its first frame to its last -- immediately engaging, and even funny!
A unique view of the incredible Camino de Santiago pilgrimage through the lens of a man who clearly knows how to focus in on the beauty of places AND people and weave them together in the most appealing way --
so much so (wow this sentence is getting long) that I found myself envying every person in the film -- I mean what an enriching experience out there...
Love love loved ""Wayfaring"" -- Bravo, Mr. Herriott! It's a beauty.",1395792000,,548,4.6020408163265305
6282695,5,B00INJPLQ8,"Once again Scott has captured the people of the trail,  I'm not certain how he is able to find such wonderful characters but his films are enriched because of his unusual talent.  He has also done a fantastic job showcasing the beauty of the terrain and the picturesque towns the Camino travels through.",1395446400,,303,4.69811320754717
6282696,5,B00INJPLQ8,"Loved every minute of this film! I am planning my own trip along the Camino de Santiago this summer, and after watching this film, my less adventurous boyfriend was trying to figure out how he can get the time off work too. I can't wait to live this film!! I am going to buy it for my parents.",1395187200,,293,4.068965517241379

6282698,5,B00INJPLQ8,"Scott ""Squatch"" Herriott has created an incredible docupalooza of images, interviews, and introspection as he invites us with him on his journey along the Camino de Santiago in Spain and France. The scenery and history are breathtaking but it is the diversity of the cultures that reminds us how we may come from different worlds yet we all share the same humanity.",1393977600,,365,4.903225806451613
6282699,5,B00INJPLQ8,This is an amazing movie with an amazing storyline to it. I would recommend it to families who are looking for an adventure and seeing what the Camino de Santiago is all about!,1393718400,,176,4.363636363636363
6282700,5,B00INJPLQ8,"Like the ""Walk"" and ""Flip Flop Flippin""  series,  Scott Herriott hits another one out of the park.

I only have a few years  left before I can retire,  but these DVD's want me to give notice and take off now.

If you liked ""The Way""  you are going to love ""Wayfaring"".  Scott's editing style makes you feel like you are on the trail and part of the group.  But then I've watched it a half dozen times :)",1393545600,,403,4.064102564102564

6282703,5,B00INJPLQ8,"Funny, charming and insightful, Wayfaring gives you a unique look into all of the different ways that people approach the Camino, which is one of the most fascinating cultural, spiritual and outdoors adventures in the world.

8643669,1,B00INJPLQ8,"Awful, horrible, not at all what I've read, seen or heard about the Camino.

8643670,5,B00INJPLQ8,I was not going to rent this after reading other reviews. So glad I did follow through and watched it with my wife. A very different prospective and humorous which I and my wife were glad to see. It really made us more inclined to do this Camino in Late May and finish at lands end in Late June give or take a couple of weeks on or around my 65th birthday. Will be a real experience for the two of us to complete together.,1504742400,,422,3.976470588235294
