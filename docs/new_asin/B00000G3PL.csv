1215883,5,B00000G3PL,"The Best Movies with cops teamed up starring Mel Gibson Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, and stars like Rene Russo, Chris Rock and Jet-Li. The Fourth One Is Kind Of My Favorite One Because it's kind of funny and action-packed!. But There Are Also Some Cool Features on the fourth DVD including a featurette, deleted scenes from the other three movies. These Movies you will love
on DVD.",1001203200,3,378,4.656716417910448
1215884,4,B00000G3PL,"Let's face it, Danny Glover and Mel Gibson have undertaken more serious acting roles then Murtaugh (Glover) and Riggs (Gibson), but probably not any that were more fun. Lethal Weapon is typical of the buddy cop movies and follows the developing relationship of Murtaugh, who is just celebrating his 50th birthday and Riggs, who is suicidal over the recent death of his wife, as well as their attempt to bring down a large drug smuggling operation. Both Glover and Gibson do an excellent job bringing raw emotion into what could have been merely a smash-up action movie.
Lethal Weapon 2 introduces a hysterical Joe Pesci as Leo Getz, a witness who Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to protect. Though the premise is the same as LW1, Murtaugh and Riggs going after the bad man, Pesci adds freshness and humor. Watch for the scene where Riggs discusses the death of his wife, powerful with an outstanding supporting performance by Darlene Love.
In Lethal Weapon 3, Pesci returns as Getz, and Lorna Cole, played by Rene Russo, is introduced as an internal affairs officer. In this outing, Murtaugh and Riggs, along with Cole, are after a cop turned bad. Lots of fun and good acting and noteworthy performances by the supporting cast particularly Damon Hines as Nick Murtaugh.
Chris Rock steps up as the new face in Lethal Weapon 4 which finds Lorna Cole and an unmarried Rianne Murtaugh (much to her father's dismay) both pregnant. Jet Li has an excellent turn as the villian in this outing. The perfect mix of martial arts action and comedy.
I enjoyed them all",1000944000,,1555,4.784386617100372
1215885,4,B00000G3PL,"If you want all 4 Lethal Weapon movies conveniently all together in a nice little cardboard box, this is for you.  If you are looking for jam-packed DVDs loaded with extras you may be disapointed somewhat. The first film does have some cool deleted scenes and I believe there is a commentary track as well.  But they get thinner as the movies go along.
Just because DVDs aren't 2-disc and loaded with extras doesnt mean they cant be good.  I am very happy with this purchase and think the DVDs are very well done.  Perhaps I am spoiled by the Die Hard Supersized triple pack, and that is why I gave it 4 stars.  One star for each disc.
Overall, this 4 pack is great for the Lethal Weapon fan, but will come up short for the DVD enthusiast who loves massive extras.",996710400,3,764,4.314685314685315
1215886,3,B00000G3PL,"The Lethal Weapon series in itself is a great set of movies, and this is a flat-out good pack of movies for the fans of the Lethal Weapon series.  This has the original DVDs with the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound and the Widescreen video, but I'm a fan of extras so I like the 3 pack director's cut better.
If you feel like getting all four movies in pack, go for it:  otherwise I would get the cheaper three pack and buy LW 4 seperately.",973382400,61,432,4.070588235294117
1215887,1,B00000G3PL,I almost bought this but have discovered the hard way that you should  ALWAYS research the DVD especially for uncut versions and missing footage.

LW 1-3 are out on DTS and LW 4 is only available in DD 5.1 and  actually contains the missing footage for the previous 3 movies !!!,966470400,257,362,4.4393939393939394

1215944,4,B00000G3PL,"All the movies, with all their special features in on reasonable sized case.  The movies are, in my opinion, far superior than the TV show.  The tales of Riggs and Murtaugh from becoming partners to becoming family.  For those who are unfamiliar with the movies a brief synopsis of each:

Part 1: Riggs gets reassigned to Murtaugh.  They investigate a murder that turns into a drug ring that becomes personal.
Part 2: Riggs and Murtaugh get into more trouble as they find a diplomat who uses his political immunity to illegal means.  We are introduced to Leo.
Part 3: The duo are back to their usual damage.  Riggs finds a woman who is his perfect match and they investigate illegal weapons.
Part 4: The final entry has them helping captives and stopping a counterfeit ring.

There is much more, but the thing about these movies is there is so much to enjoy I didn't want to spoil the fun.  No extended cut, but reportedly because those cuts were done without the director's knowledge or approval.  Donner has said about this and Superman that the original versions are his cut.  The other cuts are made by the studios looking for more money.  Smart man.",1520121600,3,1154,4.630541871921182

Theres a reason this series is so popular thats its sparked a new TV show (also great). It is beautiful art.

Yes, theres some violence and nudity, so you need to hold your gut. But the plot (from the relationships to schemes to stunts), the execution, and cinematography, combined with awesome actors - from Glover and Gibson to the villains and sidekick cops and psych - make movies well worth watching multiple times.",1516147200,,544,4.827956989247312

1216305,4,B00000G3PL,"I already have the original Directors cut versions on dvd released back in 1998
which is my preffered version of each Lethal weapon film
the picture quality is definitely not HD with 5.1 master audio mixes
but nethertheless the Digital remaster transfers still look pretty Good with 5.1 Dolby digital surround sound

This blu-ray collection of all 4 Lethal Weapon films is very good only worth buying for the Bonus Disc in my opinion
here's the Details
Disc 1,2,3,4 have the Theatrical cuts 1-4 with new 2:40:1 HD transfers & new 5.1 master audio mixes
which does look excellent actually very nice sharp & clear picture quality considering they're only the Theatrical cut versions
much better clearer & sharper than the very old dvd versions i must admit
the sound quality is a boost for sure with new 5.1 master mixes obviously better than the old Dolby digital mix
so ofcourse Warners did an excellent job upgrading the picture & sound quality for each film
tragically no Directors cut versions which is very annoying for a fan
but comparing the Theatrical & Directors cut of the 1st Lethal weapon there's only roughly 5mins extra scenes missing really
but some of the 5mins really do fit the plot more & belong back in
Directors cut is 117mins which includes end credits, the Theatrical cut is about 109mins so figure out the time comparison
Warners have added extras for Disc 1
30mins of Deleted scenes 14 scenes with new HD transfers & new 5.1 mix
some of the Deleted scenes are actually in the 117min Directors cut & some of them have never been seen before
 until this new blu-ray reissue
there's also the old DVD commentary with Richard Donner, Lethal weapon music video in 1:33:1 ratio
plus the usual original Theatrical trailer
the extras for Disc 2 are more Deleted scenes about 4mins of scenes only Digital remaster quality in 2:40:1 ratio
these scenes are from the Directors cut version, plus the old DVD commentary with Richard Donner &
Stunts & action promo 4mins from the old dvd version, not worth much
plus the usual Theatrical trailer
Disc 3 is the same as Disc 2, Deleted scenes 4mins worth-only Digital remaster quality so they're taken from the old Directors cut dvd
plus the usual DVD commentary with Richard Donner, usual trailer & Music video in 1:33:1 ratio
Disc 4 has DVD commentary plus the 30mins featurette with Danny Glover Hosting carried over from the old DVD version
and usual trailer
Disc 5 is the Bonus Disc, in my opinion is the Highlight of this blu-ray set
all new retrospective featurettes of all 4 films
PSYCHO PENSION-GENESIS OF LETHAL WEAPON, FAMILY AFFAIR BRINGING LETHAL WEAPON TO LIFE
PULLING THE TRIGGER-EXPANDING THE WORLD OF LW & LEGACY OF LETHAL WEAPON
if played together the run time is 110mins Documentary on the series
but there's no play all option on the menu so you have to select one at a time
1st featurette is 24mins with Danny Glover, Richard Donner & Mel Gibson
also writer Shane Black is interviewed, Producer Joel silver & other warners bros executives that were in office back in 1985
2nd featurette 30mins is about the original Lethal weapon film only
lots & lots of behind the scenes footage of all the stunts, the character scenes, the fighting scenes etc
everyone interviewed from the 1st featurette is in this 2nd one aswell, plus some stunt supervisors are also interviewed
tragically no other actors/actresses are interviewed like Gary Busey, Mitch ryan, Darlene Love or Traci wolfe
3rd featurette covers the Lethal weapon sequels- goes for another 30mins
the same people from the first two featurettes are interviewed plus Chris rock & Rene russo comes in this time
no new interview with Joe Pesci unfortunately
the 4th is about the Legacy of lethal weapon- 20mins
so the first 4 films can be bought as Individual Discs with their own sleeve cover and case
or buy this 5 Disc blu-ray set where the Bonus Disc is included by the way it's ALL REGIONS
3-4 stars for this blu-ray set based on excellent HD transfers for all 4 films plus the new Bonus Disc
i tell you if warners included the Directors versions of each film with new HD transfers on each of the 4 Discs
i would give 5 stars for this blu-ray set
cause it should be up to the fan which version he/she wants to watch,
not what the warner executive should decide to include the Directors cut version or not, just Disgusting",1471219200,,4352,4.70997375328084

LETHAL WEAPON - The one that started it all....Riggs and Murtaugh are on the trail of a drug lord and his sadistic henchman, played by Gary Busey.
LETHAL WEAPON 2 - Riggs and Murtaugh are back, this time, while protecting an informant, played by Joe Pesci, stumble upon counterfeiters from South Africa hiding behind Diplomatic Immunity.
LETHAL WEAPON 3 - Riggs and Murtaugh foil an armored car heist while on traffic detail after being busted for causing the destruction of a building rigged with explosives, not realizing that in doing so, stumble on a bigger caper, stolen weapons, perpetrated by a crooked ex-cop, played by Stuart Wilson and pursued by an internal affairs officer, played by Renee Russo.
LETHAL WEAPON 4 - In this final installment and my least favorite, Riggs and Murtaugh chase down a human cargo ring, led by Martial Arts legend, Jet Li. The action in this one is so so but it was below par with the rest of them but the ending was a nice touch to the series I thought.",1466985600,2,1055,4.672043010752688

It is considered one of the best buddy cop action films of it's era and Danny Glover & Mel Gibson were a great pair together in those movies. The 1st & 2nd I thought were good, however the 3rd & 4th were my least favorites but they were good in a way. Other than that I give Lethal Weapon an 8.8/10  & 5 stars.

I am NOT giving one star to movies, actors, quality of movies, etc.  I am giving one star to people who decided on the packaging.  My four bluray discs came in an ""eco-lite VORTEX"" case (presumably made by agi amaray based on what I see in my case and on casetopia dot com searching for vortex and 4-disc) that has 2 movies sharing a hub by stacking one disc on top of the other.  So there are two hubs total and four bluray discs (two on each hub).  Now I realize this might not be a big deal and you get what you pay for, but I'm personally tempted to buy a bluray case that has 4 hubs (2 on covers and 1 on each side of insert tray - like DV4R21BR sold by square deal recording) or maybe a viva-elite quad case to prevent any potential damage from handling. BTW, when I received the set, disc 3 was not attached to hub and floating in case.  Luckily there were no scratches to data side of disc.",1450742400,3,985,4.104166666666667

""Lethal Weapon"" fans will no doubt be delighted to see the whole series in one, big, high-definition, Blu-ray package, with a slew of extras besides.  Let's look at all four of the movies, one at a time.

LETHAL WEAPON
With a combination of antagonistic friendships, hard-edged violence, absurd plots, and sometimes macabre humor, Mel Gibson's ""Lethal Weapon"" in 1987 along with ""48 Hours"" a few years earlier practically reinvented the buddy movie.  ""Lethal Weapon"" moves along at a frenetic pace, providing excitement galore, so long as you don't stop to think about it.

Gibson stars as L.A. Police Sgt. Martin Riggs, a cop who has become unhinged since the death of his wife in an automobile accident.  In case you haven't seen the film, he is the ""lethal weapon"" of the title.  His fellow officers think he's a psycho because he's suicidal, willing to sacrifice his life to get a job done, or in some cases just sacrifice his life.  He's basically a slob, living alone in a trailer with only a dog for company, downing a beer for breakfast, and wallowing in the past.  In this first in a series of four ""Lethal Weapon"" films now on Blu-ray, Riggs is more of a wild man than he is in the sequels, more earnestly nuts.  A scene on a rooftop where he tries to save a man from jumping and another where he's busting some drug dealers have undoubtedly become classics.

The buddy angle is that Riggs gets unwillingly teamed up with his opposite on the force, a conservative family man named Roger Murtaugh, played by Danny Glover, a fellow celebrating his fiftieth birthday.  The two take an instant dislike to one another, which in time, of course, turns into mutual admiration and then lifelong friendship.  They become the ""Odd Couple"" of law enforcement.

Both men are Vietnam vets, but Riggs came back the more shattered by the experience.  He says the one and only thing he's really good at is killing, and, indeed, he is an expert shot.  In Riggs and Murtaugh's first day together, Riggs manages to shoot and kill somebody.  As the film goes on, so does the body count.

One may safely ignore the plot, but in the event you've forgotten it, here's the deal.  Gary Busey is a cold-blooded, psycho henchman named Mr. Joshua, an ex-Special Forces agent now working as a mercenary for a drug syndicate headed up by a former Vietnam general, Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) and manned by ex-CIA operatives.  Riggs and Murtaugh stumble onto their machinations, bullets fly, bodies fall, stuff blows up, people get tortured, and everything ends well in hand-to-hand combat between Riggs and Joshua.

The director of these ""Lethal Weapon"" flicks was Richard Donner, who gave us ""Superman,"" ""The Omen,"" ""Goonies,"" and ""16 Blocks"" among many more.  Together with screenwriter Shane Black, (""The Long Kiss Goodnight,"" ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang""), Donner keeps things moving at a pace that seldom allows one to breathe or a moment to reflect on how silly it all is.

Interestingly, as the sequels went on the filmmakers put more emphasis on humor than in this first movie.  ""Lethal Weapon"" is fairly serious most of the way, despite the outlandish nature of the goings on.  Yet, as ridiculous as the ""Lethal Weapon"" films are, the one endearing quality they all have in common is the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh.  Their friendship and repartee continue to delight and make even the most far-fetched action amusing and exciting.  They're a good team and deserved their re-engagements.

Video:
Warner Brothers present the film in its original aspect ratio, 1.85:1, using a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 codec.  The picture is fairly well detailed, if a little soft and dark, with decent clarity, especially in facial close-ups.  When it's good, the high-def video can be quite good, and when it's not, it remains at least OK.  It is a touch dark, as I say, and grainy in places, with a few scenes looking slightly dullish, but it isn't much to fret over.  Black levels are deep, colors are solid, and for whatever reason the picture quality seems to get better as the movie progresses.

Audio:
The lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 acquits itself respectably, too.  The surrounds display a few things like falling rain, crowd noises, musical ambience, gunfire, and grenade blasts, all of which have decent punch.  The front-channel stereo separation is excellent, and the dynamic range is wide.  What's more, overall transparency is good, even in the loudest climaxes like the several explosions that the movie serves up, with a taut, well-controlled bass.  Although from time to time I heard a small degree of background hiss and found the upper midrange a trifle hard and forward, in general the audio sounds fine.

Extras:
The extras include an audio commentary by director Richard Donner; fourteen scenes of additional footage totaling about thirty minutes; a music video by Honeymoon Suite; a widescreen theatrical trailer; twenty-three scene selections; and just about every spoken language, subtitle, and caption you can think of:  English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Polish, etc.

I began to appreciate the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies more over the years, especially the first two, and this second installment in the series is probably the best one all-the-way around.  Not only is it funnier, more exciting, and more action-packed than the others, it is among the best-looking, made all the better in its high-definition Blu-ray transfer.  Welcome back, Sergeants Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) of the Los Angeles Police Department.

This time we find the ""odd couple"" of police work involved in a story just as thrilling as the first venture if a tad more cartoonish in its execution.  The pair have a better adversary, though.  He's a racist South African villain named Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland), a Minister of Diplomatic Affairs who hides behinds his diplomatic immunity to smuggle gold and launder money.  And his chief henchman, Pieter Vorstedt (Derrick O'Conner), turns out to be even more evil than we initially believe, a plot twist I won't reveal.  Riggs's love interest is the Minister's secretary, the lovely Rika van den Haas (Patsy Kensit).  Sometimes, it doesn't pay to be this hero's girlfriend.

In the event your memory is a little fuzzy on the various movies in the series (there were four of them, remember, all directed by Richard Donner), this is the one where Murtaugh's house and his wife's car get destroyed.  This is the one that introduced us to everybody's favorite creep, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a character who made such a positive impact on audiences that the filmmakers brought him back for the third and fourth episodes.  Getz is a crooked bookkeeper that the police are keeping in the government's witness protection program until he can testify against some hoods.  Riggs and Murtaugh get assigned to protect him, and, wouldn't you know it, they discover he is somehow connected with the evil South African diplomat.  This is the one where Murtaugh's daughter, Rianne (Traci Wolfe), debuts on a television commercial for condoms, totally discombobulating old dad.  This is also the one that has Murtaugh sitting on an exploding toilet seat.

Richard Donner again directs with a frenetic pace, now leavened by even more funny business.  Riggs is still the maniac he always was, but he's not quite so self-destructive as before.  How crazy is he?  The department takes bets on how quickly he can escape from a straightjacket.

Things start right out with a snippet of WB's Looney Tunes theme, followed by Riggs acting nuts as he and Murtaugh get caught up in a wild, high-speed pursuit of baddies.  At one point, Riggs is actually on foot chasing a speeding BMW, and he almost catches it!  A routine drug bust turns into helicopters, automatic weapons, and Krugerrands.

One last thing:  ""Lethal Weapon 2"" is more unnecessarily harsh in terms of people dying, more brutal than the other entries in the series.  Although a person may find this a turnoff in what is otherwise a lighthearted adventure, it isn't enough to dampen one's enthusiasm for the film in general.  While you may find the movie overdone, to be sure, you'll probably have to admit the lead characters are endearing.  Overall, I found the exaggerated thrills of the series becoming a bit tiring after this second installment, but this one is the best balanced in terms of excitement and humor.

Video:
The most obvious difference between this second adventure and the first one in the series is the improvement in picture and sound of the original prints.  Whereas the filmmakers shot the first ""Lethal Weapon"" in a 1.85:1 ratio, they made ""Lethal Weapon 2"" in a much wider 2.40:1 ratio, transferred here to Blu-ray using a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 codec.  The wider screen is better because it presents a much broader vision of the action.  More important, however, the colors in ""Lethal Weapon 2"" are brighter, cleaner, crisper, and better defined in than in the first film, if still a little soft.  The hues are brilliant and alive, very deep against the excellent black levels.  One notices a touch of soft grain, no doubt inherent to the film stock and providing a realistic texture to the image.  If I have any minor reservation, it's that the picture continues to be slightly on the dark side, with facial tones suffering the most, especially during indoor shots.  Otherwise, this is a fine, vibrant high-definition transfer.

Audio:
The lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound is well focused and wide ranging, with extremely wide dynamics and a well-extended high end.  Bass could probably be deeper and carry more impact though.  The sound provides excellent front-channel width and an adequate, if not entirely up-to-date surround field.  However, do expect some musical ambience enhancement and bullets flying in all directions.

Extras:
The primary bonuses include a commentary by Richard Donner again; a brief, four-minute featurette, ""Stunts and Action""; three extended or deleted scenes, also totaling about four minutes; and a widescreen theatrical trailer.  The extras conclude with more language choices than ever and thirty-nine scene selections.

Film rating:  7/10

LETHAL WEAPON 3
By the time Warner Bros. made ""Lethal Weapon 3"" in 1992, the formula was wearing thin.  In fact, the plot and action are sillier than ever.  There is no longer even a pretense of logic for the goings on, merely explosions far and wide, guns blasting in every direction, and policeman punching first and asking questions later.  The film again teams law enforcement officers Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) with the weaselly Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), only now newcomer Lorna Cole (Renee Russo) joins them as Riggs's romantic interest.

Murtaugh, who always seems to be on the verge of retirement, is just eight days away.  He's looking forward to his final hours being peaceful and uneventful.  But with a crazy man like Riggs for a partner, we know that isn't going to happen.  As Murtaugh rightfully maintains throughout the story, ""I'm too old for this!""  I think we all are.  The two men are fast friends these days, but they bicker more than ever; they even have a fist fight.  When the story opens, the powers-that-be are busting them down to patrolmen for blowing up a building.  No sooner are they on the beat than they stop a bank robbery, battle a bevy of baddies, and become involved in a high-speed pursuit involving two armored cars.  Go figure.

This entry in the series is not so much energetic as it is hectic.  Everywhere Riggs and Murtaugh go, every step they take, somebody is shooting to kill someone else.  The villain is a former cop named Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson), now turned bad and smuggling guns.  Leo has become a real estate agent, of all things, trying to peddle Murtaugh's house for the cop's imminent retirement.  Leo's behavior with the two men most of the time resembles something out of a ""Three Stooges"" short, perhaps appropriate considering that the old comedians are Riggs's favorite entertainers.  Finally, the love interest, Cole, is a sergeant in the police force's Internal Affairs Division and a karate expert to boot.  No, you're not supposed to believe any of this.  Indeed, under Richard Donner's relentless direction, you're not even allowed a moment to think about it.

Number three isn't as bad as number four would be a few years later, but it's not the flagship of the line, either.  If you are already a fan of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, you will already have made up your mind about favorites.  If you are just testing the waters, I suggest starting with ""Lethal Weapon 2""; it's not as brutal or hard-edged as number one but not as absurd as numbers three or four.  What's more, number two looks and sounds the best.

Video:
The picture size for ""Lethal Weapon 3"" is the same Panavision scope it was for the second film, 2.40:1, and the actual image quality is about the same.  However, by a small margin, colors are not quite as bright or well defined.  Still, the picture, transferred to a BD50 using a VC-1 codec, is better than in film number one.

Audio:
The lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound is deeper than ever, not pinpoint accurate in the rear channels but wide and dynamic in the front.

Extras:
Insofar as bonus items are concerned, we get another commentary by Richard Donner; three scenes of additional footage, about four minutes; and a teaser and theatrical trailer, the former in non-anamorphic widescreen and the latter in pan-and-scan.  The extras wrap with thirty scene selections, and lots and lots of spoken language, subtitle, and caption choices.

Film rating:  6/10

LETHAL WEAPON 4
Some things should just be left alone, and the ""Lethal Weapon"" series should have ended after the second installment.  But we got two more, each of them successively weaker.  With ""Lethal Weapon 4"" we find the silliest and most sentimental of the bunch.

By the fourth round, the movie had become more comedy than thrills, with little interest in human development or interpersonal relationships and simply more bickering among the main characters.  More things blow up, more car chases end up in Neverland, and more people get shot.  It's overblown and loud, with only an occasional hint of originality.

The setting is 1998, and Riggs has finally gotten his hair cut.  He is also about to become a father with his live-in girlfriend, Lorna (Rene Russo).  For the first time, Riggs is feeling his age:  After our listening to Murtaugh exclaim for the umpteenth time he's ""getting too old for this s***,"" we finally hear Riggs admit it, too.

Murtaugh, who claimed he was ready to retire almost a dozen years earlier in the first movie, still hasn't retired and doesn't appear to have any intension of retiring.  Apparently, he's ageless.  The filmmakers also allow him to take his shirt off and bare his chest, twice.  He's about to become a grandfather.  And he takes in an illegal refugee Chinese family, seeing it as a form of ""freeing the slaves.""

Leo is back, this time as Riggs and Murtaugh's best buddy.  The character had by now become a sentimental favorite of audiences, so the filmmakers softened his personality considerably for this last episode.

Jet Li enters the picture playing a villain for the first time in his career.  He steals the film as the vicious, near-invincible killer; too bad his character is so evil.

Chris Rock also enters the picture, playing a fast-talking, hyperactive cop.  The movie mostly wastes him, although it appears the filmmakers wanted him in the story to make it even more comedic, as though they weren't sure if Gibson and Glover could still pull it off alone.

Plot?  Yeah, there's a plot, only it's just an excuse on which to hang all the gags, fights, killings, and explosions.  Something about Asian Triads, human trafficking, and counterfeiting money.

And Murtaugh's house gets it again.

Video:
In the best Hollywood tradition, we find the worst film in the series sporting the best picture and sound.  Using another dual-layer BD50 and VC-1 codec, the WB engineers transferred the film to disc in its native 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The image is sharper, deeper, brighter, cleaner, and better detailed than any of the preceding three films.

Audio:
Just as the PQ is the best of the four movies, so is the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 the best of the lot.  It exhibits a wide range and impact, with the most all-enveloping surround sound of the bunch.

Extras:
The first of the extras is a commentary by director Donner, co-producer J. Mills Goodloe, and assistant to the director Geoff Johns.  Then there's a thirty-minute featurette, ""Pure Lethal!  New Angles, New Scenes, and Explosive Outtakes,"" a 1.33:1 ratio behind-the-scenes affair made in 1998.  The extras conclude with a whopping forty-five scene selections and the usual assortment of spoken languages, subtitles, and captions.

Film rating:  5/10

BONUS DISC
The fifth, bonus disc is also a Blu-ray although a single-layer BD25.  It contains four newly made (2010) and interrelated featurettes, with the stars, director, writer, and various other filmmakers discussing the making of the movies.  The titles are ""Psycho Pension:  the Genesis of Lethal Weapon,"" about twenty-four minutes; ""A Family Affair:  Bringing Lethal Weapon to Life,"" about thirty minutes; ""Pulling the Trigger:  The World of Lethal Weapon,"" about thirty minutes; and ""Maximum Impact:  The Legacy of Lethal Weapon,"" about twenty-two minutes.  All of them are in 1.85:1 ratios, combined with vintage footage that's sometimes in 1.33:1.

Warners have packaged the five discs in a single Blu-ray case with two inner sleeves.  The case itself comes housed in an attractive, heavy-cardboard slipcover.

Parting Thoughts:
Fans of the ""Lethal Weapons"" series will probably love what the folks at Warner Bros. have done with the films, offering them in high-definition Blu-ray picture and sound, with a host of extras, even the stars and filmmakers today looking back at them.  It's true that the movies themselves tended to go downhill as the series progressed, but that's not uncommon in the film business.  It's just good to have them all in one place to pick and choose as one likes.",1434067200,20,18387,4.962369109947644

Whoever wrote the description for the website described (in great detail) the director's cut versions of these films. Naturally, I thought I was purchasing the director's cuts. That is not the case. The extra scenes can be seen in the bonus features, but they are not in the actual movies. Since I already own the director's cuts on DVD, there is no reason for me to have this set. I am thankful that Amazon is allowing me to return it with no problem, but I urge them to change the description on the website.",1420761600,,579,4.471698113207547

With the exception of the first one, the other three are pretty much garbage. I read some of the reviews on this movie set before I bought it. There's got to be a way to get the reviews from people that have the same taste in movies as I do. Maybe I need to friend a bunch of people on here or something.

A very simple set with each movie in it's own DVD case, all in a cardboard holder. The video transfer quality is pretty good considering the age of the original movies. And the sound quality is clear and really enhanced through a Dolby sound system.

There is much more than explosive action in these movies, and #4 simply has it all, including a Superb acting performance of the entire cast. Each time we watch these movies, each one is just as satisfying as the First viewing.

There is one intense or dramatic comedy event after another. Very hard to fall asleep watching these. Watching them in sequence produces a story of a cop family full of laughs and suspense.

1217298,5,B00000G3PL,"Lost in the loss of his wife, Special Forces-trained Det. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) becomes a lethal weapon, hanging on to life by its hairs, trying to move on while still trying not to let go of her memory. As the title song itself states, ""No one outside can understand /You'd take your life with your own hands / Indeed love can become a lethal weapon.""

After being taken off narcotics and deemed too much of a risk for undercover work, Riggs gets teamed with Sgt. Det. Murtaugh (Danny Glover), and the rest...well, it is history. Fighting for our safety, trouble, and quite a lot of it, always seemed to find these partners. However, this partnership was more than just ""the job,"" it became deep friendship.

Riggs moves on, thanks to Murtaugh's true friendship, the kinship developed with Murtaugh's family, and even himself again finds that, which he thought was gone forever.

If you had seen these films when they first came out, a tribute to the late 80's and early 90's, these bring back a sense of youthful foolish fun. Pure comedy, no matter how insane the slapstick antics, you cannot help but laugh.

This comes as a single set of four DVD s, one for each film, abd stacked in a single spindle in a keepcase (that is, the black package with the center spindle, with the clear polyurethane cover, the same kind of case Blockbuster was known for using.).",1398988800,,1367,4.636363636363637

1217332,5,B00000G3PL,"I say the headline with the proviso, that if you strongly prefer the extended editions of the movies, which to this point are only available on DVD, then you will probably want to steer clear of the blu ray set.  This set only has the theatrical versions of the films (which I personally am fine with) and then has the extended scenes (for films 1-3) included as bonus material on the disc for that movie.  Also Amazon seems to be combining all the reviews so to be clear my review is for the blu ray version called Lethal Weapon Collection.

There are 5 discs in all.  One for each movie, and then a 5th disc that contains 4 separate featurettes (one for each movie) which is essentially a 25th anniversary commemorative, with the highlight being a sit down interview with Donner, Gibson and Glover, with is interspersed with interviews from some of the other actors (mainly Renee Russo and Chris Rock) and film makers from the series.  They also weave in some footage from the filming of each movie.  In all the bonus disc has about 2hrs worth of additional material.

The bonus material on Lethal Weapon 4's disc is a 30 min compilation of alternate and deleted scenes and gag reel material from each movie.  So between the 4 movies, all the deleted scenes and bonus material there is about 10.5 hrs worth of content for those who go through all the extra features.

As far as the quality of the movies go.  Obviously the A/V quality is better on the 4th movie than any of the others.  You can tell there was no heavy film restoration done, so the movies pretty much look exactly the same as they always have.  So, you are not getting a great jump in picture quality that you would get from movies that has a ton of CGI  or released more recently.  That is why sticking with the DVDs for those who prefer the extended editions of the movies is fine.  I am not sure that the material included on the bonus disc is out there on the DVD releases though so you may want to take that into consideration.

In all I am very happy with the set and would recommend them for anyone who is a fan of the series, especially those of is that are old enough to have seen all (or in my case the last three) of the movies in the theater when they were originally released.  Even through some of the dialog can be considered a little cheesy (especially from the first two movies) these days, they still hold up as movies with great action, blended with comedy, and drama.",1394236800,3,2456,4.386313465783664

Don't get me wrong, I loved these movies when I saw them in the theater. They were the pioneers of the buddy-cop action comedy.
But they don't hold up well. Even without Mel Gibson's craziness tainting most of his movies now, these things have just been so imitated and one-upped that it's hard to appreciate it for what it was, since it's all kind of absurd now.

I don't know, I was looking forward to revisiting them on bluray, just a bit underwhelmed by presentation, sound and picture and shockingly, the movies themselves. Would have liked the director's cut versions, I think they were better cuts.

1217367,5,B00000G3PL,"Just finished watching all four of the Lethal Weapon series contained in this packaged blu ray...

Lethal Weapon = 100% action... One of the best movies of its kind... Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs is the perfect bad_ss, he's tortured by the death of his wife and constantly struggling with his desire to give in to his overwhelming grief and join her in the afterlife, which gains him a reputation as a cop on the brink of snapping. Mel Gibson gives a truly great performance - you feel the pain of his grief jump off the screen... there's great chemistry with Danny Glover, who creates another great character in Roger Murtagh - just turned 50 and considering retirement when he's forced to partner up with Riggs, who he's afraid will get him killed before he can retire.... both are Vietnam War vets with their own baggage from their time in service... and then there's Gary Busey in probably his last good role as the war vet turned mercenary, Mr. Joshua. Just a great movie that cast the mold and was the blue print for all the buddy cop movies that have followed.

Lethal Weapon 2 = 90% action, 10% comedy... Just the right balance, another great movie... Lighter than the first movie in tone, but Riggs is still a bad_ss on the edge, although he has been thrown a life line by Glover's Murtagh in the form of a friendship, and this keeps him from jumping off... there's a nice unexpected tie-in to the first movie and the death of Riggs' wife... Gibson gives another great performance, but Joe Pesci steals every scene he's in as Leo Getz (""Whatever you want, Leo gets. Get it? Okay okay okay okay..."") Leo is a great character, completely made larger than life with a great turn from Pesci - he adds just the right touch of humor. (""They F you at the drive thru!"") This balance worked because they relied on other characters for the levity (""She makes me want to go out and buy condoms right now."") and kept Riggs and Murtagh as serious cops who occasionally banter, albeit in tough-guy one-liners. These first two movies alone make the price of the set worth it.

Lethal Weapon 3 = 60% action, 40% comedy... Decent movie, but you can feel it starting to get stupid... Riggs still has his sweet mullet but has lost his bad_ss edge almost completely. He's adopted Murtagh's family and has changed from brooding and grief-stricken to light-hearted and funny. The banter between Riggs and Murtagh feels more like an Abbott and Costello routine now... The characters of Riggs and Murtagh have now become both the tough action cops AND the comedy relief - a HUGE mistake that derails the franchise. I ain't buying Rene Russo as a tough Internal Affairs chick either... and the inclusion of Leo Getz (with blond hair and an earring!) as a fast-talking real estate salesman trying to sell Murtagh's house is unnecessary and gratuitous, and he wears out his welcome quick.

Lethal Weapon 4 = 100% comedy... A shame what they did to this franchise... A mullet-less Riggs is now a completely different character than he was in the first two movies - he showed flashes of it in LW3, but now Riggs is a full blown prankster wise-_ss instead of a bad_ss... The jokey banter all around between Riggs and Murtagh and every other character in the movie is almost unbearable - there's jokey banter with Murtagh and Riggs, with Leo Getz, with Rene Russo, with the police captain, with the cop psychiatrist lady, with the Murtagh family, with Chris Rock... they even banter with the bad guys, going so far as to up the jokey banter by actually adding laughing gas to an interrogation... and EVERY stupid joke in the entire movie is punctuated by a grating saxophone riff. By the end of the movie you will want to throw out every song you own that features a saxophone. And Chris Rock as a tough cop? Puh-leeze. He almost ruins this movie single-handed, but he's just the biggest part of a problem that involves everyone... except Jet-LI. He makes a formidable villain, and is the only one playing it straight in the entire movie... but kicking Riggs' _ss underwater while impaled on a broken-off piece of rebar? Come on!  And someone please f-ing kill that annoying Leo Getz!",1391212800,2,4160,4.646739130434782

If you have not seen these movies by now you probably won't enjoy them. Lethal Weapon and the Mad Max collection I must have in blu-ray. I am a huge fan of action comedies, these are movies I've seen hundreds of times when I was growing up and they are hilarious.

Keywords  ACTION-COMEDY.

If you know what Lethal Weapon is all about and yes as terrible as the fourth one was.....you should buy this.
Great movies from the past, it is in high def quality and 5.1 surround sound, well as surround as it gets for those days.
I was very pleased with the buy, I watch a lot of movies, a lot of old school movies and to see it in HD 1080 is AWESOME.

I like collector boxes/packs and I was thrilled to add this one to it.
It does not come with any inserts, pictures, or items. Just the 4 movies + bonus disc.
Worth the price, worth watching again.

1217432,2,B00000G3PL,This collection contains 4 films in a 5-disc set. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover have great chemistry in this series. The picture and audio quality are fairly good in this Blu-ray collection. The films included are the theatrical cuts of the films and not the director's cuts. There is almost 3 hours in bonus content which is light for a 4-film collection. The bonus disc isn't exactly jam-packed with extras (what is provided is good but not great and did not need a separate disc). Fans will have to decide for themselves if this Blu-ray collection is worth the upgrade. Since the longest featurette is 31 minutes it does leave some fans longing for more. A 4-hour retrospective documentary on the franchise would really complete this collection. I rate the films 4 stars and this collection gets 2 stars.,1378512000,,805,4.798561151079137

1217446,3,B00000G3PL,"Okay, will make this short and sweet.  I was at BEST BUY and saw a LETHAL WEAPON 4 pack (looking like a typical 4-pack cover with every movie poster squared on the cover.)  I was dubious, because it was 19.99, and it was in a smallish blu ray case, but I bought it - and lo and behold - it held 4 discs, with each flim getting its own disc - I was encouraged.  I brought it home.  The Lethal Weapon looked slightly better than the DVD - in other words - not a great remastering at first blush, but better looking, as they all are - than the dvd counterparts - i have not A/B'd the audio yet but I know on part one there is no director's commentary but there are on the other three.  They all seem to be the basic WB discs that were released way back when with the same features - only these are the theatrical (and better - in my opinion) than the director's cuts - which I thought added repetetive and really unnessassary scenes.  So then I stick in LETHAL PART 2 and whoa and behold - it's a blu-ray of SWORDFISH!!!!!!!  This wasn't even used - it was brand new - anyway - 3 and 4 seem to be fine, - and the packaging is awful - 4 discs in a 2 disc box that has you ""stacking.""  It's all ok, and I'll return it for the right set, but for 20 bucks- - it's a bargain on blu ray to have the whole thing - BUT - the bigger issue is that LETHAL WEAPON was a great and important set of films in the cop -movie pantheon (especially the brilliant first 2 - the 3rd is not a great movie, barely a good one - and 4 is slightly better but even more misbegotten - but they are still enjoyable if you like those characters with all the dangerous aspects taken out of them) - So I would say to get this set if you see it, but be prepared to be underwhelmed with a barely -there remaster job, a typical 5.1 track and it's just not getting the justice these movies deserve.",1376697600,2,1859,3.96514745308311

1217469,5,B00000G3PL,"In the first film, they couldn't stand each other. In the second go-round, they didn't take any crap. The third time around, it was all out war. By the fourth and final installment, they were a family. Yes, I'm talking about Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). Each installment in the series is full of surprises, and they are all helmed by the man who made us believe a man could fly in SUPERMAN; THE MOVIE (and he was unfortunately fired in the middle of filming Superman II), Richard Donner.

I shan't say more than what I've teased above, but I will add that the Director's Cut of LETHAL WEAPON is pretty good, adding a scene that establishes Riggs' persona a little earlier than in the theatrical cut when he's with some drug dealers, and a scene that shows how lonely he is. The Director's Cut, though, is worth seeing On Demand. LETHAL WEAPON 2 adds a few minutes of footage, which were completely unneccessary, in contrast to the first film, and LETHAL WEAPON 3 adds two brief, but key, scenes that fill in gaps (but whether you think those scenes should have been kept in is a matter of opinion, and personally, I think Mr. Donner made the right call). I saw the Director's Cut of each film via XFinity On Demand Monday, Tuesday and today for the first time, and that is why I'm writing this review now. Personally, my favourite film in the series is the fourth one, but each movie is very very very good. Top-notch acting, great action, side-splitting comedy and stellar production values.

Each film is rated R (the first two contain violence, language & brief sexuality/nudity, and the last two contain violence & language).",1372809600,,1661,4.64625850340136

This is the listing on the item description of the Lethal Weapon Blu ray Collection, as you can see it was copied write from Amazon description and it SAYS directors cut.....But it is not...Buyers beware if thats what your looking for it is not here... I will just have to be content with my old DVD directors cut version so yes...I know what I am talking about when it comes to the directors cut.

The explosive and edgy Lethal Weapon introduced America to its favorite modern buddy team: Mel Gibson's suicidal firecracker Martin Riggs, a Vietnam vet whose reckless stunts earn him a reputation as the Los Angeles Police Department's least desirable partner, and Danny Glover's aging family man Roger Murtaugh, a veteran detective who wants nothing more than to gracefully live to see his pension. Richard Donner's smash movie is sleek, stylish, and practically nonstop action, but it's the chemistry between the combustible energy of Gibson and the paternal reserve of Glover that makes this combination so lethal. A sequel was inevitable, so Lethal Weapon 2 sent Riggs and Murtaugh after a South African drug syndicate, tossed funnyman Joe Pesci into the mix as a comic foil, and upped the ante of explosions, car chases, and apocalyptic property damage. Kung fu-kicking Rene Russo signed on for Lethal Weapon 3, a ""mad genius run amok"" adventure rushed into production without a finished script (and it shows in sloppy ad-libbed scenes) and crammed with wild high-speed chases and spectacular explosions. When Lethal Weapon 4 hit screens in 1998, the starring cast had ballooned: hot comic Chris Rock joined Gibson, Glover, Russo, and Pesci to take on a Chinese counterfeiting and slavery ring led by Hong Kong martial arts superstar Jet Li. Director Richard Donner helms every installment of his series, topping the frenzy of action and pyrotechnics with each new feature; watching the arc of the Lethal Weapon franchise is like a crash course in American action cinema of the '90s: bigger, faster, louder. Yet at the heart of every film is Riggs and Murtaugh, mismatched partners who become unlikely buddies, ready to lay their lives down for one another. By the climax of Lethal Weapon 4, as they team up against the fighting fury of Jet Li, their friendship has become the defining drive of the series. --Sean Axmaker
Product Description

Lethal Weapon (1987): With over seven minutes of previously unavailable scenes, the director's cut of Lethal Weapon is a long-overdue present for fans. Riggs's solitary homelife and the tragic loss spurring him in a reckless disregard for his own safety now come into greater focus. We see that recklessness is new scenes underlining the differences between the two cops. Murtaugh, just 50, needs reassurance about his skills at a firing range. Riggs, not caring if he sees another birthday, coolly walks into a schoolyard sniper's field of fire. All the humor and adrenaline that made this original an entertainment milestone are here, too. No scenes have been removed. But new action and new insight are now included. Include yourself in the excitement.

Lethal Weapon 2 (1989): Riggs wows the pretties of a hotel spa before getting to Getz. Murtaugh receives bad bodywork news from an auto repairman after his beleaguered station wagon sees some Riggs-piloted street action. Plus, feisty Leo shares a newly included scene in which he recalls a suspect's address by complex spins of numbers that, well, no one can tell it like Leo. And no one would follow his lead but Riggs and Murtaugh. It's police procedure, Lethal style. And it's yours to enjoy as the duo draws a bead on criminals hiding behind diplomatic immunity.

Lethal Weapon 3 (1992): Riggs and Murtaugh are back again. This time, they must stop a former cop who has become an arms dealer to L.A. street gangs.

Lethal Weapon 4 (1998): Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return as buddy cops Riggs and Murtaugh, with Joe Pesci riding comedy shotgun as chatterbox Leo. Murtaugh is still the family man. Riggs is still the gonzo loose cannon and - what's this? - family man. His will-he/won't he marriage to Cole (Rene Russo) is one of the new wrinkles in this powerhouse crowd-pleaser that also stars comedy favorite Chris Rock and international action star Jet Li. This sequel involves an action packed battle with a Chinese ganglord.",1362009600,5,4884,4.8854041013269
1217553,5,B00000G3PL,"The Lethal Weapon Collection on blu ray is just amazing, here you have all 4 movies in one great package and the picture and sound is clear and great. I give this movie 5 stars because I am a fan of these movies. After watching them all, it makes me wish they made another one.

Each movie is so enjoyable to watch and has all the action and laughs that you can ask for. I highly recommend this box set.",1361750400,,403,4.0375
1217564,5,B00000G3PL,"Everyone knows that Mel Gibson now has major issues, to put things kindly. But as Martin Riggs, loose cannon and suicidal (over the death of his wife) detective, he used his charisma, angst, and sense of humor to full effect. And, once Riggs is teamed with veteran family-man detective Roger Murtaugh, the fun begins, including what one would expect in these movies: Lots of quips, explosions, and memorable villains, most memorably, Gary Busey (another actor with issues), as Mr. Joshua in the original film.

Over time, the audience meets other villains, not to mention Leo Getz, played to annoying perfection by Joe Pesci and IA detective Lorna Cole, played by Rene Russo. Cole and Riggs do the usual hate/love dance - complete with a great scene of comparing battle scars in the third film.

While the last film is arguably weak, it still manages to keep the action going thanks to a new villain played by Jet Li in his first (I think) American movie role. And Chris Rock adds more humor to the mix (some may say too much humor by then) as fellow cop and new son-in-law to Roger Murtaugh, Lee Butters. Butters and Rianne, Murtaugh's eldest daughter, also give Murtaugh a new person to stress over/love in the form of a grandchild-to-be, much to Roger's surprise. Naturally, Riggs and Cole are on a parallel path with Riggs having found happiness with Cole, awaiting their own bundle of joy. Okay, so the last film seems like family overload, but again, the new villain angle lets everyone know this is still an action franchise, so enjoy it if just as an end to a great series.

Included in this set are the scenes which were included in the so-called director's cut (so-called since Richard Donner once blasted that and has publically stated the theatrical versions *are* his ""cut"" with the inserted scenes seen as a cash grab) as separate bonus/deleted scenes. A fifth disc not found on the UK version also contains more extras, too.

So with the price being so low, grab this now, make some popcorn and have a marathon with L.A.'s craziest cops, proving in scene after scene, movie after movie, that while they claim ""[we're] too old for this s***!"", they can still get the job done and live to joke about it.",1361404800,4,2216,4.703608247422681

1217566,2,B00000G3PL,"Let's start by saying that while loved and a ""classic"" the Lethal Weapon franchise is no longer considered premium material. That's not to say it should be relegated to the bargain bin, it shouldn't. However, that said when releasing packages like this it needs to be specific as to the versions ""cut"" of the movie included and should in all reality include any and all versions. Likewise in day and age and given the status of the franchise there is no reason to not include UltraViolet and iTunes Digital copies of the title as well. I understand it's available as a Disc to Digital conversion through service like VUDU (Excellent BTW), however, the buyer shouldn't have to pay another $8+ dollars after shelling out big bucks on the Blu_Ray package.

Warner at more value to your aging titles.",1361232000,6,796,4.768115942028985
1217567,3,B00000G3PL,"I just don't get it.  Warner Bros. spends the time & money to release these movies on Blu-ray discs, but doesn't make it clear which version is included and is still charging a premium?  Really?  I know Americans consumers are considered gullible, but I'm insulted!  Is there no expectation we'll do any research at all about what we buy?

""Oooh, shiny box with blue label - MUST BUY NOW!""

The questions I have are the following:

1) Are the director's cuts of each movie included?  And with the storage capacity of the Blu-ray disc, shouldn't the theatrical version of each also be able to be included?  I mean this isn't the Lord of the Rings, with all of it's special effects.

2) Has the audio been remastered for HD?  That was a major complaint with many of the DVD releases.  Some had Dolby, some had DTS, some had both and some had nothing but stereo 2.0 but there was a broad, somewhat inconsistent range across all of the releases of the 4 movies.  In the picture provided, first off, it's a Canadian release, which I really don't know if it makes any difference.  But at the bottom, it mentions DTS-HD MA 5.1, which is loseless but only if you have the necessary equipment, otherwise it scales-down to lossy.  And it's variable bit rate - so, yes, no maybe so?

So, in conclusion, too many questions unanswered to buy now, even with the sale this week.  If through more research, I'm able to determine anything prescient, I will update this review accordingly.",1361145600,8,1471,4.574712643678161
1217568,5,B00000G3PL,"I have enjoyed these movies ever since I can remember!  I grew up between 2 homes, my dad and step mom and my mom and step dad, where action and sci-fi movies were played often, so needless to say I grew up on a lot of the classics such as these films, Star Wars, Die Hard, Terminator 1 & 2, etc, etc.  These ones were a popular watch at my mom and step dad's house.

I think the first one I ever saw was 2 back sometime around 6th grade or something like that, and from there I went on to eventually see 1 and 3...and then 4 when it eventually came out.  2 was the favorite movie until 4 came out, but we enjoyed all of them!  I have loved these films ever since!  Some of the best buddy action comedy movies ever!  Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are awesome together in these films, and their chemistry together on screen just flows well.  LoL, I love the chief too dealing with the 2 of them, and Mel Gibson's exchanges with the precinct shrink...classic!  Acting is all around pretty superb.

As far as humor in action movies, you don't get much better than this, and they get funnier with each passing film!  The exchanges between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are often pretty comical.  Then throw in Joe Pesci in LW 2 and his shennaigans, and it just adds to it.  Then you throw Chris Rock into the mix in 4 and it's all a riot...4 is probably the funniest one of all of them.

Action wise, it's off the hook!  Quality car chases, lots of shoot em up moments, explosions, all that action packed goodness!  Again, 4 probably takes the cake in this department too, having probably the most action of them all.  All of them are great though as far as action.

As far as the packaging is concerned, I like it!  And a whole lot better than the DVD copies I had too, which were in what I like to call the stupid cases...those taller ones with the plastic bars on the top and bottom, and the plastic bar that you open on the side to open up the DVD, and you have a hard time fitting them into your shelves next to other DVDs because the stupid plastic bars snag on the other DVDs.  Yes...those kind of stupid cases!  I'm glad I finally have this Blu-Ray set because it meant that I could get rid of those stupid cases, LoL.  I'd been trying to upgrade to the Blu-Ray set for a while now and then my wife finally got it for me for Valentine's Day, (she's awesome like that), and I was glad to finally sell of the DVDs.  I'd say the only thing that I thought was funny about the packaging is that there's 5 discs, LW 1-4 plus a bonus disc, but the casing had 6 disc slots.  Why on earth would they make a 6 disc case for only 5 dics.  Seems kinda funny to me, but not really a big deal.  What matters is that I have some of my favorite action films of all time in high definition and in a set that fits much more nicely in my movie collection than the DVD copies, and I'm super excited!  :-)

For any of you action lovers who have not seen these movies yet, what are you waiting for?  To any of you who love these movies and are looking to upgrade to Blu-Ray, do it!  Choice material!  I've marathoned these movies many times, and I'm looking to do so again very soon!  Choice viewing!",1360886400,,3178,4.133768352365416

It's hard to believe but it's been 25 years since the first Lethal Weapon appeared at the theatre. In my opinion, watching the Blu Ray today, shows it's held up well. This is the director's cut with seven additional minutes, most of which shows the difference between Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). Murtaugh has been with the Los Angeles Police Department since 1967 and is contemplating retirement. That's when he meets Riggs. Riggs joined the Army at 19, became a member of the Special Forces, then was an assassin for the C.I.A. which explains the rouge aspects of his character. He often defends his love of weapons and hand-to-hand combat by saying, "" ... the only thing I was really good at."" The difference in the two men is ultimately one of the reasons the guys become such good friends.
Relive all the adventures from the epic fight between Riggs and Joshua (Gary Busey) in Murtaugh's front yard; Lethal Weapon 2 where more comedy is added to the action/adventure series introducing federal witness Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), who joins the boys to capture millions in drug money; Lethal Weapon 3 in which our heroes battle a crooked ex-cop who's become an arms dealer to the L.A. street gangs and finally Lethal Weapon 4 finds Riggs going to marry Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), Murtaugh reluctantly meeting his future son-in-law Det. Lee Butters (Chris Rock). Murtaugh stubbles upon a Chinese immigrant smuggling ring. Riggs finale fight with Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li) is worth the cost of the DVD.
Rumors come and go about a Lethal Weapon 5. In a 2011 interview Glover, then 64, went into his Murtaugh character and said, ""I'm too old for this!""",1338940800,4,1728,4.798657718120805

1217629,4,B00000G3PL,"Richard Donner's long-running LETHAL WEAPON series may have run its course by the time its fourth installment was released in 1998, but for action fans, they remain personal favorites -- the pinnacle of the Joel Silver-produced, stylized ""buddy pictures"" that became a permanent part of our movie-going culture during the 1980s and 90s.

Of course, it helped that Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, as a pair of mismatched L.A. cops, had splendid chemistry together on-screen, and also that Donner, who seemed to find his niche as an action filmmaker with the series, handled each picture with plenty of energy and distinction. Go ahead, say that two, maybe even three films in the series was enough -- but you won't find a lot of viewers who weren't at least mildly entertained by either the first or second entries in the series at least, while parts 3 and 4 made box-office chum of its counterparts financially if nothing else (though with the star profit participation and salaries, I'm not sure the studio made a whole lot of money in the process).

After a lengthy delay (the European versions of this set have been available for well over a year), Warner has rolled out a 5-disc LETHAL WEAPON COLLECTION on Blu-Ray, offering improved 1080p transfers of the first two films (previously available only in awful-looking, standalone Blu-Ray platters), the debut of the later sequels, and a bonus documentary. Each film is presented in its original theatrical version with the deleted scenes offered as extras.

All the transfers here are quite good, and if you previously owned the old Blu-Ray or HD-DVD editions of the first two films, you'll notice an appreciable improvement in those transfers here, with stronger detail and bolder colors. The third and fourth films fare even better, with DTS MA soundtracks on-hand for each picture.

Extra features aren't overwhelming - the main draw are the copious deleted scenes, some of which had been added to prior, director-unapproved ""Extended Cuts."" Donner contributes commentary tracks that are, unfortunately, not all that interesting, dominated by long gaps of silence and with the director having to be prompted by an off-mike moderator at certain points. Music videos are also on-hand throughout the four movie platters, with the fifth disc reserved for a four-part, almost two-hour new documentary. I say ""new,"" even though this retrospective talk with the principal players (Donner, Gibson, Glover, etc.) was shot in the spring of 2010. It's an engaging and fun look back at the series' production, showing that the chemistry between the stars and director was, unsurprisingly, as strong off-camera as it was on the screen.

Even if the supplements are a bit light, this is still a recommended purchase for ""Lethal Weapon"" fans, though the international, region-free box-set release is considerably less expensive (and has the exact same content on it).",1337644800,8,2905,5.133192389006343

I purchased the UK version, and have watched all four of the movies in the set.  Of course I haven't seen the USA version, but it will most likely be the same.

I am very pleased with this Blu-Ray purchase.  I took notes after watching each of the four movies.

I thought the video quality was great.  The first movie didn't have quite as good of video quality as the last three, but it was still very good.  I noticed a little fine grain in some of the scenes in the first movie, but didn't see any in the last three.  In all four of the movies, blacks were black, without grain, and without distortion.  There were a lot of night scenes in the fourth movie, and they all looked great.  Overall, I give the movies an average of 9.4 on a 10.0 scale, with 10.0 being absolutely perfect.  I have never rated a Blu-Ray less than 4.0.

Aspect ratio was 2.35:1 or 2.4:1 in the last three movies, and, for some reason, 1.78:1 or 1.85:1 in the first movie.

All four of the movies have DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, which is also great.  There is a lot of surround sound, except for the third movie, which doesn't have as much as the other three.  There really isn't much sub-woofer bass, but I did notice more in the fourth movie.

Movie 1: 1 hour and 47 minutes.
Movie 2: 1 hour and 50 minutes.
Movie 3: 1 hour and 54 minutes.
Movie 4: 2 hours.

All of the movies are very good, but my favorite was the second movie.  There is a 5th disc, but I did not watch any bonus material.",1333670400,31,1581,4.192691029900332

Mad Max, Braveheart, even Ranson, almost everything he touched was gold.  But Lethal Weapon changed everything.  The prototypical 1980s buddy flick, teams the unstable Mel Gibson with the stable family man, Roger Murtaugh, played by Danny Glover.  Whatever it was, these two had an absolutely magical chemistry on film that defied insanity, death and even bad scripts as the movies went on.  While the movies get progressively worse as they got bigger, with the exception of 2, Gibson and Glover propel this through sheer star power and will.  If you want to see two masters at work, doing what they do almost effortlessly, resulting in pure eye candy, check these films out.  They are a tad violent and a little sewer mouthed, hence the R ratings, but they are fantastic.  Add Joe Pesci to the mix, right off his Goodfellas role, and you got a great movie on your hands.

If these are not the special editions, that would be too bad, because they are fun, but only the first one adds any real grabbers.  The scene where Riggs walks into a sniper's line of fire who was shooting kids is chilling and establishes Riggs' death wish quickly and brutally.  Modern post-Columbine sensibilities may find it hard to take, but it is an amazing scene.  All the other scenes are filler, but really fun filler.  If you can take a good hard R with lots of great comedy, this is a movie set for you.  Just remember it is a product of its times, and people were not as politically correct then.  These still stand out literally as some of my favorite films that I never get tired of watching.",1332288000,13,1700,4.604651162790698

1217651,4,B00000G3PL,"Let's face it- the kind of movie embodied by Lethal Weapon franchise has become cliched.  2 cops with radically different personalities are thrown together, and despite their differences, they become buddies, and take down the bad guys......a premise that was thoroughly used both before ""Lethal Weapon"", and after it.  But you know what?  The ""Lethal Weapon"" movies manage to somehow keep things endearing, even with the over-the-top approach used, by balancing the action with a sense of continuity and growing familiarity, with not only the main characters, but also their coworkers and family.

For those not familiar with the franchise, ""Lethal Weapon"" opens by introducing two very different cops: Martin Riggs, a suicidal loner, whose daily attempts to court death are a reaction to the loss of his wife, and Roger Murtaugh, a veteran cop and family man, whose catch phrase is ""I'm getting to old for this @!$#$!@"".  The first movie throws them together when Riggs is transferred to homicide, with Murtaugh being stuck with the guy no one else wants to be stuck with.  As the movie proceeds, we get to meet Murtaugh's family, in between the action sequences.  Mel Gibson does a good job of playing crazy here (although by now, his real life behavior has managed to outstrip Riggs' nuttiness in more unsettling ways).  Danny Glover does a great job in selling the more grounded Murtaugh in such a way that the average guy can really identify with him.  It's that dynamic that manages to inject the good-natured fun into this franchise that sets it apart from just another set of action movies.

The second film ups the ante, as this time, the bad guys seem more untouchable, being crooked South African diplomats, with diplomatic immunity and high-grade armaments to back them up.  The supporting cast continues to grow, including the introduction of Joe Pesci's likeably obnoxious Leo Getz character, while the movie also ties in the death of Riggs' wife to good effect.  I actually like Lethal Weapon 2 a bit more than the first one.  Lethal Weapon 3, as is often the case in franchises, shows a bit of sequel fatigue, as the bad guy is a bit forgettable.  But Richard Donner manages to pull some more tricks from his sleeve, including the introduction of Lorna Cole, an Internal Affairs cop who is tough enough to impress Riggs, yet feminine enough to be a believable romantic foil for him.  Maintaining the same supporting cast members and their characters (Leo Getz, the hard-bitten police chief, the misguided police department psychologist, even the bomb squad guy from the second movie) also goes a long way in making it feel like a worthwhile series to be a fan of.  Of course, when you hit the 4th installment in a franchise, you're playing with fire, artistically speaking.  Fortunately, Lethal Weapon 4 is not awful in the way that Batman and Robin was....it's just a bit forgettable.  Jet Li's character is a bad guy who's not really the head bad guy, but ends up being the defacto chief villain because his superiors are some ill-defined quartet of Triad bosses we barely see.  The plot also seems to be running on autopilot at this point.  That being said, the movie is saved by......yes, you guessed it, franchise continuity/affection, and the fact that it resolves multiple running themes in the franchise.  Fortunately, the creators decided to end the franchise at this point on a satisfactory note of closure....well, at least as of now.

The DVD set is, like the Superman, Batman and Matrix franchise 4 Film Favorites collections, on a set of 2 sided DVDs.  The picture quality is pretty decent, and it's also worth noting that LW 1, 2 and 3 are all the Director's Cut versions.  Aside from that, the extras are pretty skimpy, but for a bargain price like this, I can't complain.  Finally, I'd like to discuss a couple things that were a point of contention in another review I read.  You can't really fault this franchise for its so-called ""reckless"" portrayal of violence, as it's silly enough to be clearly intended to not be taken seriously, and is presented as such.  This isn't like a Michael Bay movie, where tone-deaf brutishness and excessive collateral damage is combined with the attitude that the movie is supposed to be taken seriously somehow.  On another note, the fact that Mel Gibson has revealed himself to be someone with serious, serious personality issues doesn't impact my enjoyment of the movies, in the way that any ""real life"" personality flaws that Wagner, Ted Nugent or Christian Bale exhibited don't prevent me from enjoying their work.  That's just my approach, though.  Anyway, this is a pretty good budget collection, in my opinion, and worth the price.",1325462400,2,4710,4.895465994962216

Lethal Weapon: A weary older cop is paired with a ""crazy"" young cop just as a Vietnam vet sets up a major heroin shipment
Lethal Weapon 2: Riggs and Murtaugh (and Leo Getz/Joe Pesci) are on the case of South African smugglers
Lethal Weapon 3: The trio (and Det. Lorna Cole/Rene Russo) go after a former officer who sells cop-killer guns to the streets
Lethal Weapon 4: The foursome (and Det. Lee Butters/Chris Rock) try to stop Chinese slave traders/counterfeiters

Just from my descriptions, you can tell there's a sense of progression in the films, and that's one of my favorite things about them. There's an amazing amount of consistency in the series - every movie has the same stars (and guest stars, like Murtaugh's family, who we get to see grow up), the same director, even the same score composer. It's fun seeing familiar sights as you watch the movies, and while the scripts aren't always perfect (3 drags and has some annoyances and 4 doesn't take itself too seriously), they're still a lot of fun!",1323993600,,1212,4.685446009389671

Sometimes I wish though these trilogies would halt from the top. The first film is five stars in my book and the rest are 3 to 4 stars because they get more noisy, more killings, more unrealistic/sensational and lose their touch of the dynamic duo whom uncover a sting instead of too many other nuances. However each season can capture part of the magic during the first with some very funny scenes with Joe Pesci (Leo Getz)who catches a shark all the while Riggs and Murtaugh have a touching ""below the belt"" moment. Then there is Chris Rock with the former cell phone debacle before the government learned how to tax the enterprise. Plus Pesci and Gibson recapture this touch at his former wife's grave until Gibson acts as though he ruptured his spleen when his live-in love (Rene Russo) is on the way to deliver their baby.

1217684,5,B00000G3PL,"This series of films is one I've been hoping for for awhile now.  I am aware that the first two films are available here in the states but they don't have any special features to speak of.  Imagine my surprise when I was just looking things up randomly and found an entire box set, five discs, of the Lethal Weapon films available on blu ray and for a reasonable price!!!!

Now I'm not giving plot synopsis of each film and I'm not really going to review each film with any depth.  Sorry, just don't see the point in doing so for a 24 year old franchise.  The first Lethal Weapon is an American movie classic at this point.  It's been ripped off and emulated multiple times(and unfortunately still is today). At the time of its release there wasn't a huge action movie market back in 1987.  Sure, there were action flicks, mostly starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, but most of them were real low budget and grindhouse type fare.  This had name stars and a big director(Richard Donner of Goonies, Omen and Superman the movie fame) attached.  Now this wasn't a huge budget film either.  The film only cost about seven million to make, and even back then that was peanuts.  The Lethal Weapon film had something that the other films of the time like Commando didn't have; GREAT CHARACTERS.  Characters that you believed and were interesting and ultimately you cared about one way or another.  The plot itself is ludicris and impossible.  The way the police go about their 'procedure' is very much of the 80's, but the snappy dialogue, fun action set pieces(set pieces that stand out due to them feeling urgent and possible, unlike most action films of today), and great cast chemistry made this film original.  If this film had just been a slice of life drama and not an action film then it would've still worked.  Lethal Weapon 2, while not as classic for being original as the first, just furthered the strong points of the first and arguably made a better film.  Adding a great addition in the form of Joe Pesci playing an annoying state witness named Leo Getz.  The antics with stars Glover, Gibson and Pesci are not to be missed.  Letha Weapon 3 is where the quality started dropping.  It's by no means a bad film, it's actually a really fun good one, but the routine-ness of the proceedings were starting to show through.  Joe Pesci's character has no function in the film beyond the fact that he was so popular in the last movie.  The villain is weak to boot.  The action is great and Gibson and Glover are just as endearing and watchable.  Plus, they added a legitimate love interest to the mix played by Rene Russo.  Russo and Gibson have a now classic scene of foreplay as they compare battle scars.  Lethal Weapon 4 is the low mark in the series.  I woudn't blame or argue with anyone that hated this film.  It's a more episodic film(due most likely to the film being written as they were filming, which you learn in this new set's fifth disc suppliments).  There are action scenes, tho they are awesome and expertly staged, where the main characters bicker and joke WAY TOO MUCH.  You just want them to shut up for a second so you can watch the scene play out.  It's also the most sentimental in the series as all invovled were aware of the serie's long running popularity and the fact that they knew this would probably be the last.  As with previous sequels a character is added in the form of Chris Rock(in his first major studio film) as Glover's would-be son in law. Now I like the film enough despite it's flaws.  It's still a fun flick, espeically if you're already a fan of the other films.  It has a nice sense of closure, jaw dropping action(especially a brilliant freeway chase like no other),and a great villain played by Jet Li(this being his introduction to mainstream America).  So, those are the films themselves.

The new Import Only blu rays are AMAZING.  Totally worth picking up for any fan.  The transfers are all crisp.  This is the best the films have ever looked.  The first two films exist here in the states on blu ray but they're pitiful transfers in comparison.  Each disc ports over the blu ray features for each film(deleted/extended scenes, vintage featurettes, etc) and adds brand new commetary tracks for the first three films by director Richard Donner. I was excited by the new commentary tracks, but was a bit disappointed.  Donner is accompanied by the new set's producer and he seems more interested in watching the films then commenting on them.  Plus, he doesn't seem to remember much and often confuses scenes with other films in the series.  The producer doesn't help him much as he doesn't do much to push along the commentary.  More annoyingly, sometimes you hear Donner responding to someone in the recording booth who isn't mic'd, and he starts answering questions with no frame of mind for the audience. Can be very frustrating.  The dvd commentary for part 4 has been ported over from the 1998 dvd, and it's still a fun listen as Donner is accompanied by several members of that film's production team.

Sorry folks but these ARE NOT THE DIRECTOR'S CUTS of the films, or as they should properly be referred to as 'the so-called director's cuts'.  Back when Lethal Weapon 4 came out Warner Home Video released director's cuts of the first three films.  They had previously deleted scenes incorporated back in(all these scenes are included on each film's disc as special features). Now while Donner didn't object he didn't personally put these scenes back into the films.  He states that the theatrical versions are his director's cuts.  The first film had the most added footage.  While at the time I was excited to see more, the film buff in me knew something was wrong.  The first film has a great deleted scene where Riggs confronts a sniper at an elementary school.  This is an exciting scene in itself but redundant when edited into the final film.  It essentially does the same job as the scene where Riggs goes undercover to buy coke at the Christmas tree lot---it shows that he's daring and prone to violence.  It's cool but doesn't do much for the final narrative.  I know some love the director's/extended cuts and would prefer them to the theatrical, but Im not one of them.  I'm happy having theatrical versions with the deleted scenes as extras.  SO DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT DIRECTOR'S CUTS.

There's also a fifth disc with a four-part making of/retropspective documentary that runs about two hours.  It has brand new interviews with Richard Donner, Danny Glover, Mel Gibson, Chris Rock, Rene Russo, screenwriter Shane Black, producer Joel Silver, and producer Mark Canton among others.  This is the motherload right here.  It goes in deep about the production for all four films(while, like the Indiana Jones dvd set, focusing more on the first film more) and gives you every scoop you could want regardin this film series.  It's fun and informative.  My favorite moments that I can think of off the top of my head have to do with Donner admitting his own ignorance regarding the suggestion of Danny Glover being offered up by casting director Marion Dougherty for the role Roger Murtaugh.  ""But Danny Glover is black"", was Donner's initial response not realising right away that he could cast a black actor despite the fact that the script didn't specifically describe one.  Show the times and how they've changed.  My other favorite has to do with the long process that went behind Riggs' suicide attempt in his trailer.  Gibson wasn't ready to do so asked to have it pushed back in production schedule.  They cut the trailer set in half and carried it around with them from location to location until Gibson finally said he could pull the scene off.  And if you've seen the first film you know it was worth the wait. A truly sad and harrowing scene ever committed to any action film I've ever seen.  There's tons more of this and it's worth a view by EVERY Lethal Weapon fan. Just to hear about Shane Black's original, and much bigger, scripted ending is worth the view.  I know I'll be watching it again in the future.

All in all this is worth the upgrade.  Great transfers.  An abundance of new and old special features.  Despite the weak first three films commentary tracks I was happy to give them a listen, tho I won't be listening to them again, this is a great set.  If you prefer the theatrical versions over the director's/extended cuts, or just don't give a crap either way then this is a total no brainer!  Buy it!  You know you want to.

PS: I don't know of any official US release date for these films in this particular form, but I am kind of annoyed that I have to import American made films with new special features, especially a franchise this popular and influential.  I couldn't wait so I obviously had to.  Though, Warner Brothers doesn't regionally code their discs so it should play in all players.  I learned this last year when I got copies of The Goonies(another Donne classic) and Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory(which includes special features not even on the US dvd releases like a great Tim Burton commentary).",1299456000,57,9123,4.653533458411507

I am not surprised and like ""Unkle Jack"" (above 1 star reviewer) said, double sided discs are usually defective.
Other 4 favorite dvd movie sets have this 2 movies only out 4 on 2 discs goof as well (just look at 1 star reviews for the Matrix fav 4 pack).
I suggest buying these movies individually or as a box set were each film is still in its individual case were this goof is not likely to happen!
This 4 pack is a good deal only if you don't get defective discs! (and if you don't like Special Features)

P.S. How does text on dvd say, ""Lethal Weapon 1 and Lethal Weapon 2 on other side"" but have movie 3 and 4 only.
It is like the text was put on in one step and then the dvd went to the wrong movie printing machine and get the  opposite movies the text describes.",1278979200,2,1143,3.982532751091703

Thanks,

1217700,5,B00000G3PL,Lethal Weapon is a classic and one of my personal favority cop/action movies that is somewhat reality based.  There is no disappointment in this box set - you get exactly what you'd expect - all four movies.,1277683200,,207,4.594594594594595
1217701,5,B00000G3PL,"No matter how many times I watch these films, they never get old, most buddy cop films & shows rely on the chemistry between the two pals ( shows ""Miami Vice"", ""Starsky & Hutch"", & ""NYPD Blue"" did this quite well) & of course this film series where two cops who have nothing in common are partnered up ....

""Lethal Waepon""(1987)
This is the best one, it definately takes you back to 80's L.A., In this one we get to know the characters & who they are, Mel Gibson who had been known for the ""Mad Max"" films is Martin Riggs, a disgruntled cop who is still grieving over the loss of his wife & is a bit suisidal which makes him a bit more dangerous than the bad guys, Danny Glover who had yet to be recognized as a bankable actor, & got his big break here is Roger Murtaugh, a family man who in some ways is just waiting on his retirement, when Murtaugh's vietnam pal's daughter plunges from a highrise, Murtaugh who is partnered with Riggs sets out to find out why & discover that his friend was involved with drug lords from their vietnam days, Gary Busey is on hand as a enforcer for this drug ring & is intimidating, his & Riggs face off in the end is somthing you knew was inevitable, the action set-pieces toward the end are well done, especially the Hollywood Blvd scenes, as well as the foot chase, all in all, the best of the 4 films

""Lethal Weapon 2""(1989)
With the success of the first film, this one is my least favorite of the 4 films, not that it is bad, it is on par with the first film in terms of action, but these bad guys(South African Diplomats) are just not as scary as the drug ring in the first film, the bomb on the toliet scene while original seemed far-fetched at best, plus Riggs takes an interest in a secretary working for the guys, which seemed a bit out of character for him, however despite these faults this one works as a solid action film, the opening moments are the best with an all out chase in downtown Los Angeles & Joe Pesci is quite fun as Leo, an accountant who enbezzeled money from these bad guys & Riggs & Murtaugh are assigned to protect him, & there are many laughs when these 3 interact, but the accountant angle reeks of ""Midnight Run"" out the year before with Robert DeNiro & Charles Grodin, it is almost as if they wanted to take that idea & do it over again, however this one has its many  moments but a bit overated I think

""Lethal Weapon 3""(1992)
Many felt this one was a step back from the first two films, however I disagree, this one had a interesting story angle to it, I can see why Gibson really jumped on this script, this one deals with a cop gone bad who with his police connections is stealing automatic guns seized from street gangs & recirculating back out for a profit, Stuart Wilson(Mask of Zorro) is this bad/former cop Jack Travis who is also using armor-piercing bullets that can penetrate bullet-proof vest, Murtaugh is close to retirement & is a bit too careful here, Renee Russo is introduced as a Internal Affairs cop pursuing Jack & his misdeeds & doesn't quite see eye to eye with Riggs & Murtaugh in their investigation but eventually allows Riggs to know what she knows when Murtaugh ends up killing a street gang member who was a friend of his son, who was supplied his gun by Travis, they then set out to stop Travis altogether, & what results is another cool standoff followed by another cool chase scene, Joe Pesci once again returns as Leo that is more or less comic relief, but still fun, the opening moments are fun as Riggs & Murtaugh try to disarm a bomb in a building parking structure & accidently trigger it, this scene is a classic, always wait for the bomb squad, this one to me was a bit better that  ""2""

""Lethal Weapon 4""(1998)
Yes, this one is a bit more comical in its approach, but this one is my 2nd favorite next to the original, the opening moments with a flamethrowing trigger-happy individual is a quite fun, especially the way Riggs disarms him, this one is sort of a throwback to the first film that has Jet Li as a former Chinese Triad who is counterfitting foriegn money to get his men out of China, & is using chinese slave labor to make the fake money, Jet Li sort of puts Gary Busey's scary villian from the first film to shame, & when Riggs & Murtaugh face off with him, you know there is going to be hell to pay, this one brings back Renee Russo & Joe Pesci(again) back & introduces us to Chris Rock as a up & coming detective, when you watch this one, you feel the sense of loss of the first film's 80's feel, but this one is without a doubt probably the most action packed, aside from the opening, you have another foot chase,a face off with Jet Li, another freeway chase(best action scene in my opinion), a Pontiac Grand Am crashing through a building, a shoot'em up fiesta at the end & another Jet Li face off, the action scenes do seem a bit redundant, but hey, that is why we watch these films right, & this one must have been sharing  space with ""Rush Hour""(out a few months later), because places in both films look the same, these two were made at the same time, all in all a great action film & this one has the deleted scenes from the other three films in its special features section if you don't want the Special Edition versions",1266105600,,5256,4.297679112008073

1217737,5,B00000G3PL,"Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino may be a couple of the greatest actors around, but as shown in the recent movie Righteous Kill, they don't necessarily work together well.  That movie had a lot of problems, but what stood out to me was there was little chemistry between the two:  they didn't work well as a team.  Chemistry is important:  it can make a so-so story entertaining, and a good one great.  While it's not really a knock against them, Danny Glover and Mel Gibson are rarely considered in the same acting league as DeNiro and Pacino (or at least the DeNiro and Pacino of past decades; their recent performances have been less impressive); nonetheless, they work great together.  They are more that the sum of their parts, as shown in the Lethal Weapon series of movies.

While few would consider this quartet of movies as Oscar caliber, they are not meant to be:  they are action-comedies.  In the original Lethal Weapon, the emphasis is more on the action.  Gibson is Riggs, a detective on the brink of suicide after the death of his wife.  Instead of killing himself, he constantly puts himself in dangerous situations.  Glover, as Murtaugh, is the complete opposite of Riggs:  he's a sober family man who constantly laments that he is too old for this stuff (okay, the word isn't stuff, but you get the idea).  Partnered together, they investigate some murders tied to drug runners who are ex-Special Forces, just like Riggs.  This sets us a final showdown between Riggs and a veteran soldier played by Gary Busey.

In Lethal Weapon 2, Riggs is no longer suicidal, but he still is rather wild; his antics get the pair assigned to protect an accountant-for-the-mob named Leo Getz (played by Joe Pesci).  They also tangle with some South African drug runners who hide behind diplomatic immunity (this movie was filmed when apartheid was still in full flower).  With the appearance of Getz, the movies start to expand the family of characters, something that will continue in future movies.

Lethal Weapon 3 has Murtaugh on the brink of retirement and trying to avoid all those things that get cops killed right before they retire.  Of course, with Riggs as a partner, that isn't going to happen.  The plot deals with an ex-cop who is selling weapons to the local gangs.  It also introduces Rene Russo as Riggs's love interest; she's almost as tough as he is, leading to a comic romantic scene where they compete to see who has the best scar.

Lethal Weapon 4 has both characters being promoted from sergeant directly to captain, an effort by the department to tie the two to desks where they can't cause as much destruction.  As they take on some Chinese mobsters led by Jet Li, Riggs has to deal with impending fatherhood (Russo's character is pregnant) and whether he can remarry.  Murtaugh has to deal with impending grandfatherhood, while unaware that his daughter is secretly married to a fellow cop played by Chris Rock.

As the series develops, the emphasis is more and more on comedy, with the serious elements pushed aside.  There are, in all the movies, plenty of gunfights, chases and things blowing up, all of which will satisfy action movie fans.  The stories, however, do get weaker as they go along.  By Lethal Weapon 4, the writing itself is a bit lacking, but the sheer chemistry that the characters have with each other helps prop up the material.  Credit should also be given to Richard Donner, who directed all four movies.  It ain't Shakespeare, but these are all fun movies to watch.",1236384000,,3512,4.736408566721582

you get all four films in one package, and they even give us the unrated director's cut of the 1 - 3, theatrical version of 4.

Lethal Weapon - the most serious of the series. centered around ending local heroine imports.

Lethal Weapon 2 - centered around a south african diplomat's legal immunity, and money laundering. loads of extra comic relief from Joe Pesci.

Lethal Weapon 3 - centered around the stop of circulation of illegal armor piercing bullets, and more laughs from joe pesci.

Lethal Weapon 4 - centered around stopping the local asian slave trade. deffinited the funniest of the series, with the addition of chris rock, and the return of joe pesci

The bad:  The Lethal Weapon 4 isn't really what you might think it should be.

Explanation:  If you've seen Lethal Weapon 4 on DVD, then you know what the best parts of it are -- the deleted seasons from the first three movies, and the behind the scenes / gag reel.  This is what you expect.  The problem is, those features are *NOT* included in this set.  Each film is presented as one side of a two-disc set (LW1 is disc 1 side 1, LW2 is disc 1 side 2, LW3 is disc 2 side 1, and LW4 is disc 2 side 2).  The problem is that the good features of LW4 were on side 2 of the original DVD.  So when you click on the dynamite icon to show those features, the menu says to flip the disc.  Well, since it's not the real disc, you can't do that (LW3 is on the flip side of the disc).  In other words, no special features.

If you're buying this set to get the first three films, you're probably saving yourself some cash.  But do yourself a favor and buy Lethal Weapon 4 separately so you can actually see the special features (which are, by far, better than the film).",1205280000,20,1139,4.026785714285714

1217795,5,B00000G3PL,"The Lethal Weapon movies are some of the best buddy/action/comedy movies ever.  This two disc set includes all four movies in the Lethal Weapon series for the price of one movie.  Each of the movies is shown in the Director's Cut edition.  There are trailers for the first three movies, but not for LETHAL WEAPON 4.  However, LETHAL WEAPON 4 does include a commentary with director Richard Donner.  If you're unfamiliar with the Lethal Weapon franchise, a brief synopsis of the films follows.

LETHAL WEAPON is the first movie in the series and introduces the unlikely cop team of Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson).  Murtaugh is fifty-years old and a veteran officer.  Riggs is an up-and-coming star of the police force, known for his atypical style.  They are partnered together and become close friends while working to bring down a major drug cartel.  Besides being just a good movie, LETHAL WEAPON is also notable for being the movie that made Mel Gibson a box officer superstar in the United States.  Mel became famous because of Mad Max, but it was LETHAL WEAPON that made him a household name in the U.S.

LETHAL WEAPON 2 continues a few years after LETHAL WEAPON.  Murtaugh and Riggs are still partners.  Once again they are on a drug case, but this time it's an international drug ring of diplomats from South Africa with diplomatic immunity.  They are also put in charge of protecting a key witness and informant, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who becomes a great secondary character in the series.  Also, Riggs falls in love and pulls a house off a cliff.  As a bit of trivia, Riggs was supposed to die in this one, but the studio called for a rewrite knowing how successful the franchise would be.

The Lethal Weapon series was going to be a trilogy wrapped up with the retirement of Murtaugh at the end of LETHAL WEAPON 3.  After thirty-years on the force, Murtaugh is finally going to retire.  However, eight days before the big event he and Riggs become involved in a case of gun running and cops gone bad.  Riggs finds lasting love with an internal affairs officer, Lorna Cole (Rene Russo).  Leo Getz also returns.  This film is the weakest of the Lethal Weapon movies and the studio wisely decided to bring everyone back for one last film.

LETHAL WEAPON 4 brings back the entire cast of the Lethal Weapon films for one last go-around.  Lorna Cole is pregnant with Riggs' child.  Murtaugh's eldest daughter, Rianne (Traci Wolfe) is secretly engaged to Detective Lee Butters Chris Rock) and has a baby on the way, too.  Meanwhile, Murtaugh and Riggs get entangled in bringing down a Chinese king pin, Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li) determined to move his operations from the Orient to Southern California.

1217840,5,B00000G3PL,"When me and my dad first got our dvd player 5 years ago, this boxed was one of the first things we bought. Containg all four of the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies, this set includes four of the best cop movies ever made, all digitally remastered. Here is a synopsis of each movie.

""Lethal Weapon"" (1987, R) The first film in the series has L.A. Police Officer Roger Martough (Danny Glover) investigating the murder of Amanda Hudsacker, the daugter of a war buddy. Meanwhile, Martin Riggs is a cop on the edge. Suicidal after the death of his wife, he is unbearable to be with. Martough is a consumate family man with three kids and a loving wife. So how can these two possibly work together? Well, when it is revealed that Amanda's dad had his daughter murered by a drug ring ledy by Gary Buset, Riggs and Martaugh will stop at nothing to bring them down. This results in some of the greatest action sequences ever put on film.

Glover and Gibson both found their signature roles as the buddy cops in this film. Busey as usual plays an excellent bad guy. The action scenes are great and the film is also very funny. 5/5

""Lethal Weapon 2"" (1989, R) The second film in the series has Gibson andc Glover returning to their respective roles. Adding to the fun is Joe Pesci as motot mouth money launderer Leo Getz, who is in witness protction and is put under the watchful eyes Martin and Roger. When a drug ring starts to operate in L.A., Martin and Roger are out to stop it. This film includes several great action sequences as well as the famous exploding toilet scene, and is filled with action and laughs provided by the excellent performances of Gibson, Glover amd Joe Pesci. 5/5

""Lethal Weapon 3"" (1993, R) Returning after a four year hiatus, Gibson, Glover and Pesci have reunited for this sequel. Roger is about to retire, keaving Martin feeling down. Leo is now a pain in the a*& insurance agent trying to sell Roger's house with no luck. And Rene Russo plays the lovely Internal Affairs agent who Martin falls hard for. But when a crime ring operating in the city starts manufacturing bullet piercing armor and start dealing guns to criminals, Murtaugh teams up with Riggs once more and it results in another all out adventure highlighted by an 80 feet motorcycle jump. It's more of the same with the ""Lethal Weapon"" gang. And that's a damn good thing. 5/5

""Lethal Weapon 4"" (1998, R) Five years aftet the third saga, Gibson, Glover, Pesci and Russo return for the fourth chapter. Riggs and Lorna are expecting a child, Leo is now a cop, and Murtaugh is about to become a grandfather. Chris Rock joins the cast as the new cop on the force, bringing his trademark brand of humor into the mix. And Jet Li stars as the leader of an Asian crime ring who Riggs and Murtaugh are out to get in one last adventure. I know a lot of people do not like this chapter, but this one is my personal favorite and a great way to bring everything full circle. 5/5

This is an excellent boxed set that belongs in any dvd collection. Buy it as soon as you're able to do so.",1122681600,,3055,4.436720142602495

1217843,5,B00000G3PL,"Finally, all four of the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies are available in one boxed set. One of the greatest series ever to grace the screen, the movies have Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as cops on the edge bttling internation criminals while trying to keep their lives in order.
1987's ""Lethal Weapon"" is where it all began. Roger Murtaugh (Glover) is a veteran cop who is also a consumate family man. He is very careful and doesn't take any risks. Martin Riggs (Gibson), on the other hand, is a lonely, suicidal police officer who takes risks that even Dirty Harry wouldn't do. How could these do ever work together? Well, when a young girl mysterious jumps to her death out of a highrise apartment window, the two are assigned to work together. What ensues is a nonstop action (including a shootout at a Christmas Tree store and a a daring rescue of Murtaugh's daughter) as well as lots of funny moments. Also, the two cops, opposite as they are, strike up a friendship that would go on to make millions at the box office.
1989's ""Lethal Weapon 2"" has Gibson and Glover back in their roles. The two cops are slightly different now. Murtaugh is still the family man but now is more of a risktaker. Riggs is still the more daring of the two but has calmed down... somewhat. When Murtaugh's house is invaded by German criminals, the duo cracks down on a crime ring selling drugs. To make things a little more interesting for them, they are assigned to look after Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a big moout money laundere in the Witness Protection program. Pesci turns in one of his finest comedic performances in this film. Like the first one, it's exciting and funny.
1993's ""Lethal Weapon 3"" came after a 4 - year hiatus. This one is my personal favorite. Gibson and Glover are back yet again, and Joe Pesci returns to the fold as well. Murtaugh is getting ready to retire from the force in this installment, leaving Riggs a little down. Somehow, Murtaugh knows that his last case will be a dangerous one. A shady ex - cop is selling armor - piercing bullets to his workers and kidnaps the police chief. Once again, Murtaugh and riggs have to keep the city from mass destruction while keeping themselves alive. This film icludes several great scenes, including the opening bomb sequence, the motorcycle off the roof sequence and the coda. This film is significant because Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) joins the team. She will go on to play an important role in Riggs' life.
""Lethal Weapon 4"" came aftr a 5 - year hiatus. Most people call it the weakest effort of the series, but I like it. In this one, Riggs is now much more somber, finding inner peace with himself thanks to Lorna (Rene Russo), who is giving birth to Riggs' first child. Murtaugh is preparing to become a grandfather. Joe Pesci's Leo Getz is now a cop. Chris Rock is also a member of the force and the godfather of Riggs' grandchild. One thing stands in the way of this happy time. A Japanese crime ring led by Jet Li is plotting something and Riggs and Murtaugh go on one last adventure before riding into the sunset - amidst a frenzy of babies.
Overall, great dvd set. These are among my all - time favorite films. Let's hope that the cast reassmebles for ""Lethal Weapon 5"" soon.",1090108800,,3228,4.529109589041096

1987's ""Lethal Weapon"" is where it all began. Danny Glover is Roger Murtaugh, a decent and respected cop who has a beautiful home, & a loving family, plus a hefty pension to boot. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) is just the opposite. He lives alone on the beach. He is a suicidal wreck, about to snap at any moment. But he can still blow any s.o.b who comes within a 50 - foot radius of him. So imagine the surpris when these are put together to solve a mysterious suicide. Well, the result is magic, complete with spine - cracking action and plenty of humor. A classic.
1989's ""Lethal Weapon 2"" finds the two cops back on the street. Murtaugh is still the family man but now is more of a risktaker, while Riggs still is the daredevil of the two, but has calmed down... somewhat. When Murtaugh's house is invaded by German criminals, the two begin to crack drown on a drug ring operating somewhere in the city. The duo is put in charge to protect a murder witness named Leo Getz (a hilarious Joe Pesci), a big - mouthed money launderer who somewhat helps the team find out what they need to know. This is another great addition to the ""LW"" cannon.
After a 4 - year absence, Riggs and Murtaugh are back (along with Leo) in 1993's ""Lethal Weapon 3"". And now they have a new addition to the crew: Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), an Internal Affairs agent who turns out to be the perfect match for Riggs. what ensues is a race top stop a crime ring selling armor - piercing bullets that could kill with one shot. The most action -packed ""Weapon"" yet, including Gibson's amazing jump 80 feet of a roof on a motorcycle.
""Lethal Weapon 4"" came after a 5 - year hiatus. I know that many consider it the low point in the series, but I enjoy it. Things have changed for the two cops. Murtaugh's family is about to grow bigger with the addition of a granddaughter, and another child. Riggs has seemed to have conquered his demons and lives with Lorna, who is also expecting a child. Leo is now a cop as well, and still doesn't know when to shut the hell up. Now, the team has to stop a Japaneese counterfeit ring. What ensues is a great chase sequence, high - octane humor and great kung - fu sequences. Adding to the fun is Jet Li as the villian and Chris Rock as a cop on the force, plus the godfather of Riggs' new child.

More syndication going on in the sequel, ""Lethal Weapon 2."" The mullet is back with Murtaugh. They are assigned to protect one of the most annoying guys in the world. Joe Pesci plays that man. More talking, more action and explosions. Good sequel. ""Lethal Weapon 3"" is cutting it close with it's overuse of bad jokes. The mullet is way too long here. Rene Russo was added in the cast to show more flair. Ok movie. Finally in ""Lethal Weapon 4"" you have Joe Pesci and Chris Rock going back and forth about cellular phone companies.

1217861,4,B00000G3PL,"This special edition box set with all the Lethal Weapons is an impressive package with some good extra material.
The first of the Weapon films is still the best, with Mel Gibson as the suicidal cop Martin Riggs paired up with Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) as his reluctant partner. The action is great, and while it does tend to get carried away sometimes (not helped By Richard Donner's frenetic pacing), it's still the most fun of the franchise, and one of the best action films of the 80's.
Mel is great in one of his first major film roles, and Glover works well with Gibson. Director Donner, who gave us Superman (1978), directed all the Weapon films, but this one is the undisputed finest. Action at it's most outrageous.
The second instalment is not quite as good as the first, but its still exciting frenetic fun, with some witty humour. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are the partner- in -crime duo again, and this one sees Riggs and Murtaugh joined by Joe Pesci as Leo Getz, the annoying cop who returns in parts 3 and 4. The action is as impressive as the former one, and director Richard Donner's hard- as-nails approach to the film makes it as exhilarating as it's predecessor.

Lethal Weapon 3 and 4 are the weakest of the franchise, yet still retain soome of the cool action present in the first 2 films, with Gibson and Glover doing a ""take the money and run"" deal. The action is good, and in Lethal Weapon 4, Jet Li as the bad guy ups the hard-edged approach. However, the last two films aren't as much fun. The extras are good, if not great, with trailers, Featurettes, Behind-the-scenes Footage an Audio Commentary and some additional Footage.",1025222400,17,1659,4.60472972972973

1217863,5,B00000G3PL,"This is an awesome collection of 4 action packed, full of laughter and good times movies you will ever watch. You have your choice of widescreen or full screen on the first 3 movies (widescreen only on the 4th) and Lethal Weapon 4 has alot of special features that will add more than enough entertainment than any one person can stand. The fact that they were abke to keep most of the characters around (and keep adding new ones with each movie) was amazing and allowed you to get to know each character better and better with each movie.
You will be hard pressed to find a better collection of movies (at least until Star Wars & Idiana Jones come out) and the only other set that matches these so far is the Die Hard series. Buy this set and you won't be disappointed.",1003276800,4,769,4.347222222222222
