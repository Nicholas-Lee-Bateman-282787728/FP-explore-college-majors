8431269,4,B004IURTY8,"One of the most successful Indian (Bengali, to be more specific) fictional characters -- in the mold of Sherlock Holmes but fiercely Indian but no less entertaining and also the subject of some of the most popular mystery TV series in the sub-continent, author Saradindu Bandyopadhyay's creation gets a new lease of life from rising director Anjan Dutta. This late 2010 cinema release, and apparently the first of a series of adaptations by Dutta for the big screen, proved a hit at the box office in West Bengal. Nicely written, well acted and with the choice of one of the less obvious of the Bakshi stories ('Adim Ripu') as the source of the script, this is another in a run of decent films to come out of East India in recent months. While actor Abir Chatterjee is not going to turn out to be my favourite lead to play the role, he does a decent job in a part that has been played by a whole host of famous actors before. The product synopsis above and the other reviews give a flavour of the story so I'll limit myself to saying that if you have an interest in the non-commerical (i.e. non-Bollywood) cinema of India and/or you're a mystery/Holmes buff, you'll probably enjoy this film. [Note: probably for genre fans only if you don't speak Bengali due to the absence of English subtitles, a glaring ommission on the part of Databazaar Media who've licensed and released this for the US market].",1313366400,2,1401,4.585657370517929
8431270,4,B004IURTY8,This movie seems great but it is a total letdown for non-Bengali fans of Bomkesh Bakshi as there are no subtitles. Maybe this is intended only for Bengali audiences and that's fine. But why not state upfront that this is not subtitled?,1310342400,3,235,4.619047619047619
8431271,5,B004IURTY8,"A very different movie from Director Anjan Dutta. Good casting, good background score, over all a paceful movie. You will not get bored for any moment. Moreover, nobody has overacted, which I usually find in Dutta's recent movies (sorry if I sounded rude). I think this new movie is a result of a very tightly written script. Acting wise, both Ajit (Saswata Chatterjee) and Bomkesh (Abir Chatterjee) are superb. You will not waste your money, if you buy this DVD. This is far better than those recent Bomkesh movies made in last few years. I would expect Anjan Dutta to make some more movies using the same cast.",1296432000,3,612,4.675925925925926
