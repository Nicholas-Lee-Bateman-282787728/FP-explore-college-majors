The fact that I remember this story so well after all of these  years should be proof enough that it is truely a work of art. It served our  class as the perfect forum for discussion, and a fine example of literary  expertise.

2066091,5,B000286RQG,"Besides his famous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DEVIL-S-DICTIONARY/dp/0820324019/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DEVIL'S DICTIONARY</a>, San Francisco newpaperman Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce (1842-1914) wrote many supernatural and Civil War short stories. AN OCCURENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE is best-known of the latter. This French-made short film (28 mins.) of that tale was required viewing in high schools back in the 1960s.

The story opens with Confederate sympathizer Peyton Farquhar being executed by hanging from the titled river span. He's pushed, falls, the rope snaps and Peyton lands in the water, unharmed. He manages to free his hands, untie his bound feet and safely escape from a barrage of rifle fire.

For a day and night Farquhar flees through an endless forest in the general direction of home-- some 30 miles distant. All through this taxing journey he thinks about wife and kids. Peyton begins to imagine strange sights and noises, and is convinced that he dozes even while walking. After coming to full consciousness near his home, Farquhar runs (in stunning slow motion) with arms outstretched toward his wife. He suddenly feels a blinding pain in the back of his neck...

The literary device central to ""Owl Creek Bridge"" has been reused in many films.

2066101,2,B000286RQG,"The DVD starts with the warning that the film is old and the DVD has not been cleaned up in any way.  Gee..it would help if that warning was right next to the title on Amazon.  Some scenes were hardly visible onscreen.  As an adult, I could appreciate some of the scenes and look past the murky audio and blurry visuals, but I dreaded even attempting to show this to my eleventh grade students.  They HATED it!  It was an interesting interpretation for its time, but the part where Peyton runs toward his wife and runs toward his wife and runs toward his wife and...ad nauseum...it looks like a 60s hair commercial.  ""The closer she gets the better she looks.""  I know what the director was trying to do, and it may have worked back then, but my kids, were moaning, ""Come ON, already!""  It's worth a look if you have some film students who will appreciate the effects and directorial choices, but do not buy this in hopes of clarifying the original story for your high school students.",1360195200,,985,4.4636871508379885
2066102,2,B000286RQG,"For those fans of this film looking for the highest video quality, the best option is probably the DVD version released in France, containing ""Occurrence"" and the other two Bierce stories also adapted by filmmaker Enrico.  The French DVD has very high video/audio quality, and of course nearly all dialogue in the film is spoken in English.  However the DVD is region 2 only, so you will have to convert it with computer DVD burning to enable US playback.

There is a disclaimer at the beginning of the film that suggests the distributor has done its best to get a clean copy of the film.  I have a hard time believing that this is anything other than an old kinescope film shot off a TV monitor back when it aired on the Twilight Zone and then fuzzied up to remove video artifacts.  Scratches are to be expected, but this film is so dark as to be nearly unwatchable.  Even the free version on YouTube is better quality.",1264896000,4,572,4.419047619047619
2066110,1,B000286RQG,"Amazon.fr sells a DVD of this under the title ""La Riviere du Hibou"". It contains not only the film ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" but the adaptations of two other Ambrose Bierce short stories, ""Chickamauga"" and ""The Mocking-Bird"". All three are by the same director, and these form the trilogy from which The Twilight Zone derived a slightly edited version of ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" for American television audiences. Thanks to Warner Home Video, you can now watch the entire trilogy.

The good news: the audio is in English (the inner voices of characters are in French, but in Occurrence these are very brief and unobtrusive), the French subtitles are removable. The sound and picture have been digitally restored, the sound quality is very good, the picture quality is excellent, stunning in places. ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" is presented in it's original full length, with the original French title sequence. You have never seen this film look this good.

The bad news, you'll need a multiregion player to watch it on, it's a Region 2 PAL disk. And this DVD will cost you a bit more.

Buying from Amazon.fr is simple, you use the same login as your account here, plus you can use the Google translator to get through the French menus if you are unsure. But it's easy, English is often just French pronounced poorly.

If you are not so adventurous, by all means petition Warner Home Video to release this DVD here. Very, very little work would need to be done to ready this DVD for the North American market, and based on the passionate comments about this film here, there may indeed be a strong market for it.",1251244800,22,1636,4.729824561403508

There is an apology at the start of the DVD warning that the film print used to make the DVD was of poor quality due to age. Black and white prints usually hold up much better than color film stocks, and the film is not exceptionally old. This is a shame because I find it difficult to believe that a better print of this film could not be obtained by the distributor.

One would think that in this ""digital"" age a reproduction would be as good if not better than the original...WRONG!  The reproduction is shadowed, faded, scratchy- sounding, and overall, certainly NOT worth the money.  I sincerely hope that someone with a sense of cinema history and the necessary technological skills would take-on the project of creating a competent reproduction of this film to prevent its loss to future generations.",1231286400,6,613,5.08

It seemed amazingly vivid, mind-expanding, moving and a masterpiece of film-making. It stayed with me from this one viewing for the next 42 years. Just now I watched this dvd. The quality was appalling, and the experience was the biggest let-down imaginable. I couldn't believe it. Fuzzy, with incredibly poor sound.

2066116,1,B000286RQG,"This must have been transferred hastily from film to video, then to DVD.  In any case, it is so dark that almost all detail disappears.  In some sections it's hard to make out what's going on at all.  This version was produced by Monterey Media.  Beware!

It was a big moment for me when I originally saw the film in grade school.  Bierce's stuff is never easy but always worth it, and this story has a classic twist ending. I was really looking forward to seeing it again.  I'm very disappointed.",1200528000,8,497,4.395604395604396
2066117,5,B000286RQG,"This powerful film was first shown in the USA on Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone"", with no commercial break, in the 1960's. Until just in the past 6 months I had not found anyone who had ever seen it. After the excitement of finding another living soul to discuss it with, I did another search on Amazon and found it available. It has been locked away in a vault by the family of Ambrose Bierce who wrote the original story. This incredible film is in B/W, and should only be in B/W, has no dialog, only sound effects, and a very short music accent. It takes place during the Civil War and is as visually addictive as the story itself. To tell the story line is to ruin the impact of viewing it. I highly recommend it and believe it will become one of your treasured videos.",1198281600,4,771,4.287671232876712

2066119,3,B000286RQG,"Saw this years ago on 16mm and loved it then. Perhaps a bit less so this time around - maybe because I knew the ending? Nevertheless, it was still a good one.",1193184000,2,158,3.96875
2066120,2,B000286RQG,"Enrico's legendary film of the Bierce short story, an adaptation arguably as good as the original, certainly deserves a print freshly struck from the original negative.  The film has been used as a ""textbook"" introduction to cinematic techniques as well as to the uses of time in film--and moreover it's been cited as the inspiration for feature-length films such as ""Donnie Darko"" and the underrated but powerful ""Jacob's Ladder.""  Unfortunately, for someone who has seen a good 16mm print, this DVD transfer is a pale imitation of how the film should look, so bad I can't bear to watch it let alone screen it for students.  (If you're a jazz buff, you'll appreciate the credits, which include the expatriot American drummer and original member of the Modern Jazz Quartet, Kenny Clarke.)

There's another 25-minute French masterpiece that uses the same theme and which has acquired an even more devoted, cult-like following: Chris Marker's ""La Jet&eacute;e.""  The film takes a while longer to sink in, but upon doing so, it's unshakeable, a permanent part of the viewer's consciousness.  Good thing, because the surviving VHS and DVD prints are even worse than ""Occurrence""--so unwatchable as to be pointless.  The copy that I recently saw was so lacking in definition and grey scale that it was impossible to discern the film's one and only moving image.",1172707200,12,1356,5.053811659192825
2066131,5,B000286RQG,"Actually this is a pretty clean copy.  I was hestitant to buy it after reading some of the negative reviews, but it looks pretty good to these eyes.  One of the best literary, short films of all time.",1171411200,2,200,4.2368421052631575
2066132,5,B000286RQG,"This was the first film that blew my mind. As an 8th-grader circa 1970, I recall watching this film with my church group. Its images, seared into my young mind, have returned to me many times over the years. Finally, over the past few months, I searched it out. I was amazed at how much I remembered -- a slithering water snake, a sandy beach, a long row of trees, the distorted voices of the soldiers, the ending.

In the years since I first saw ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" I have developed (somewhat) my appreciation for good film and cinematography. And good film this is. Using hardly a spoken word, it intelligently takes us into the mind of a Civil War era spy awaiting execution by hanging. We experience his longing for the life he is leaving as well as his mounting terror. The underwater shots especially are amazing and well-shot. There are subtexts of life v death, and even a hint of Christliness in the central character.

My second viewing, 36 years after the first, was worth the wait. ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"""" is a 25-minute psychological and emotional masterpiece -- a perfectly-rendered period piece that precisely echoes the mood and methods of 1862.",1162771200,10,1191,4.69377990430622

I don't know if it takes place in Alabama, or not, but it does take place in the south. A confederate spy is about to be hung from a bridge, and the next thing you know his noose comes undone, and he falls in the water alive, and he takes advantage to get home to his wife, and when he sees her he tries to reach out to her, but he ends up clutching his hands around his neck, and then the mood sets back to the actual hanging, and he's dead. I feel it's a bit high priced here, so I will wait a little bit, but if it doesn't come down I probably will buy. As I said I love this story.",1148688000,2,758,3.8653846153846154

In this piece, the punishment of death by hanging is being carried out in formal, methodical fashion by a group of Union soldiers. The sentenced man dressed in civilian clothes is led to the center of a bridge, placed upon a wooden plank that hangs out over the river, his body thoroughly tied and then a noose is put round his neck. It's early morning and the sun is beginning to rise. The birds are chirping loudly as nature goes about its business. As the final moment approaches the man is becoming visibly agitated and starts to cry. Past thoughts of a wife or lover flash through his mind but the reality of the moment is unrelenting. The order is given, a soldier steps off the plank and down falls the man . . . down into the river? Underwater we can see that the rope has snapped and the man is deep within the river desperately, but successfully removing the noose and the ties that had him bound. Off go the boots and he's swimming for the surface. He's free! At the surface the joy of living hits him with full force. The miracle of a spider web, the song of the birds, the feel of the wind across his face . . . joy!! But the soldiers on the bridge have spotted him and he must swim down the raging river of life to avoid the stillness and empty solitude of death. A stunning little piece of cinematic magic.",1139356800,5,1417,4.291044776119403

It was this film, which aired as the last ""new"" episode of the original classic TV series way back in 1964.  Along with its Oscar, it also won an award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1962.  Rod Serling's tacked-on narration for the ""Twilight Zone"" airing is just as appropriate today as it was back then:  ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge--in two forms, as it was dreamed, and as it was lived and died.

In a way I do beleive that the director did give clues to the ending due to all the unrealistic things that happened to the man.  There is very little dialogue in this movies and i think that is something that contributed to making this such a movie.

2066142,5,B000286RQG,"This French short film, which was nominated for and WON both the Cannes Film Festival Award and an Academy Award, brings Ambrose Bierce's short story to life in a powerful way. With very little dialogue, this film, while discarding Bierce's explanation of how Peyton Farquhar was captured and sentenced to hang as a spy (and which actually is not necessary, in my opinion), depends on the visual rather than the spoken and succeeds admirably! The film may last less than half an hour, but in that time the viewer is rivetted not only by Roger Jacquet's performance as the condemned man but also by the beautiful scenery, the tight editing and just the right pacing of the action (the music, especially the slow lovely ballad ""A Livin' Man"", sung in the style of the Old Southern spirituals, also sticks with the viewer). The twist ending (which is worthy of the best TWILIGHT ZONE episodes [which, by the way, this film was used for in the fifth and final season of that wonderful series]), made me actually catch my breath, more than when I actually read ths original story. I heartily recommend this film not just for literature-lovers and film buffs but also for anyone with a love of the unusual and mysterious.",1026172800,54,1215,4.735849056603773
2066143,5,B000286RQG,"I haven't seen this film in a couple of years, but it's imagery and beauty still linger with me today. This is a very surreal, haunting piece of film, executed with macabre brilliance unparalleled by any other film of the genre, especially for having been made in the early sixties. This film clearly brings to mind Adrian Lyne's ""Jacob's Ladder,"" from the early nineties. Another personal favorite of mine, ""Ladder"" certainly marks a resemblance to ""An Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge"", though done with the knowledge, budget, and sophistication that decades can surely bring. If you are not familiar with this movie, I highly recommend acquiring it whenever you can. Fans of slightly disturbing, yet beautifully haunting films will certainly not be disappointed.",1005609600,6,762,5.203252032520325
2066144,5,B000286RQG,"I just saw this a few weeks ago in my 11th grade English class.  Our teacher really didn't have a lesson plan for the day, so he played this film for the class.  Nearly everyone in the class hated it and was laughing the whole time, but something about the film hit me hard.  This is definitely one of the most memorable films I've ever seen in my life.  The end is the real beauty of the film.  The way the mood changes from rejoiceful, as the hero is running to his wife, to solemn and cold, as the hero is suddenly hanging from the bridge.  My entire class was laughing hysterically when the hero is running to his wife.  As soon as the scene shifted back to him hanging from a bridge, motionless, the entire class fell silent, as did I.  This is one of those rare films that slaps you in the face and leaves a mark that lasts forever.  See this film by any possible means.",1005177600,10,876,4.136094674556213

Even at the time of his death, his mind gives him an escape from the reality he is living. Our minds are great and our lives are important. It has taught me not to waste either of them for you never know when it all can come to an abrupt halt. The writer and director out did themselves in this movie.",1003708800,4,390,3.949367088607595

2066150,5,B000286RQG,"Now get this.  Beginning in the first grade, our teachers in a small Southern school would drag all of us kids into the auditorium to see this weird film EVERY YEAR like clockwork.  Our little minds would work overtime  to figure out what was going on with this condemned man as he fought  valiantly to maintain his grip on life, and our little hearts would flutter  when he finally made it home to the plantation and that lovely woman who  put her hands around his neck and....
After the film unspooled, we kids  returned, stunned, shocked, obliterated, to Math or English class.
Who  knows what playful sadist decided we should watch this film over and over  for EIGHT STRAIGHT YEARS, but I remain oh-so-grateful.  AN OCCURRENCE  informed and changed my view of life, of time, of being, of cinema, and  most the kids that went to that small strange country school remain twisted  anti-conformist buttkickers.",961113600,9,910,4.7935483870967746
