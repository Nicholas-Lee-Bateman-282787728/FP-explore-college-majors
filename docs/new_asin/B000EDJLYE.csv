Teaching kids about safety is certainly important, and who better for the job than Gary Coleman? 'For Safety's Sake,' a 1986 instructional video telling kids all about just that, felt that Gary could get across these lessons like no one else. This is true to some extent, because regardless of what you think of him - when Gary talks, people listen. I think it's because we're always expecting him to ask Willis what he's talking about. Sadly, he doesn't hit that line here, but he does wear a hideously oversized lab coat while randomly pushing buttons on the world's largest fake computer.

Have you ever gone out for a sushi dinner with your friends, and been on the receiving end of a dare to eat that pile of green wasabi in one shot? Well, watching For Safety's Sake is kind of like eating that pile of wasabi. You don't regret that you did it, but you'll never ever do it again. It's torture for sure, but it's the kind of torture you can tell your grandkids about. The video runs 40 minutes, and covers all the basics - how to handle strangers, what do to in case of a fire, safety measures in the kitchen, and so on. Gary, who was 19 at the time this came out, looks mighty pissed that he still had to play a kid. Well, SORRY Gary. If you don't want to get typecast, grow a few feet.

More inoffensively stupid than actively bad, For Safety's Sake is probably the funniest video I've watched in the past five years. They weren't trying to be funny, but when you film Gary

Coleman visibly reading cue cards about the proper way to cut salami, it's pretty tough not to laugh. Or cry. The video is incredibly tough to find, presumably because anyone who had a copy burned it to avoid further pollution of the human race. I paid more than I care to admit for it, but at least I have a good excuse - I have no idea what to do if a stranger comes to the door with a 'package' and my mother isn't home. Gary, will you help me?",1154908800,4,1962,4.337874659400545
