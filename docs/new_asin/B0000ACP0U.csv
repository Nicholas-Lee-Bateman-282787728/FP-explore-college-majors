1905248,5,B0000ACP0U,I've been a fan of Tony Little for many years. I've owned several of his AB dvds and vhs. He never disappoints. His methods work. You will see results fast.,1285372800,6,156,4.233333333333333

7996807,5,B0000ACP0U,"When I lived in the UK I used Tony Little's exercise video cassettes and LOVED them.  I was so happy to find this dvd and the one on butt & thigh reduction.  If you use these you will see results!  I did miles of walking and these dvds to get and stay in shape, not to mention lose weight and inches.",1452816000,,300,3.8852459016393444
7996808,4,B0000ACP0U,"This is a good, very challenging, very quick ab workout.  Tony Little is a goofball for sure, but in a fun way.  The workout is only about 15 min. long, including a warmup, but that means I can fit it in 3 or 4 times a week, adding to or alternating with other cardio and strength workouts.  You might not want to pay for a 15 min. workout, but if it's effective, it's money well spent.  This has modifications of the length of each exercise for beginner, intermediate, and advanced; I push myself a little to complete the advanced and feel afterwards as if I've really gotten a good av workout.",1446508800,,595,4.333333333333333

7996810,4,B0000ACP0U,"Same Tony Little, quirky, but fun encouragement. It starts with a warm-up, which I fast forward past because I use this after other exercise. I am disappointed that I can't skip past the warmup or skip to certain exercises using DVD chapters.  Otherwise, I'd give it 5 stars.",1413244800,,275,4.729166666666667

7996812,5,B0000ACP0U,"I love this workout, then again I have always liked Tony's workouts.  Especially since I cannot do the heavy duty jumping in the air workout routines.  Thanks Tony.",1377129600,,164,4.821428571428571
7996813,5,B0000ACP0U,"Was everything I wanted, it was like a brand new DVD. Good ab workout for beginners to intermediates level people.",1364774400,,114,4.75
7996814,5,B0000ACP0U,"Very good workout for beginners or those who have not worked their stomach muscles alot. I haven't always worked my stomach muscles as often as my legs and arms but this video is helping and Tony Little is nice to listen to, a good instructor, nice voice. He makes it easy to want to put the dvd in the dvd player and get going with the workout.",1360886400,,345,4.164179104477612
