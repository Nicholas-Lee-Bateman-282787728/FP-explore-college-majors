8485486,5,B005STRMXG,"Great movie.  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

Great Movie !!",1490227200,,385,4.686567164179104
8485487,4,B005STRMXG,"This is a Cecile B. DeMille production filmed on location in the South Pacific. Even though most of the movie is an arduous trek through the jungle, this is a fascinating film to watch. Essentially a drama/adventure, there is also humor and pathos in this film.  Claudette Colbert is marvelous as the timid school teacher. Shes actually the focus of this film, and the men come to appreciate her beauty more as the journey progresses. This is a movie worth watching.",1469750400,,466,4.753086419753086

8485489,3,B005STRMXG,"Director Cecil B. DeMille's bizarre jungle adventure proved a resounding flop in 1934. Viewed today, ""Four Frightened People"" is a watchable pre-Code artifact with engaging performances and impressive cinematography by Karl Struss.  Not a complete success, but certainly preferable to DeMille's extravagant musical fiasco, ""Madam Satan"" (1930).",1446854400,2,344,6.319148936170213

8485491,3,B005STRMXG,"C.B., as he was known, is one of those who made Hollywood THE great name in movie making. It is a  well-known story, the new film-makers, driven by necessity to find a place where the Edison Company could not enforce its legitimate patent rights, where, in other words, it could produce ""pirate"" films, went as far as they could from the Eastern shores, where the Edison writ was most easily enforced. Once scouting began, for a variety of reasons,  including the weather, Los Angeles was chosen to replace New York City and environs, as the movie capital of the United States.
DeMille, a former actor, was one of pioneers for what became Adolphe Zuckers, Paramount Pictures. Once given his chance, he showed an extraordinary sense of what the ordinary American wanted in the way of a night out at the Movies. Girls, sexual innuendo (with no overt sex once the Hayes Office, the Censorship Office, was put in place), Ladies in Distress, Men who Were Me,n but who also were viral protectors of the ""Fair Sex"", wholesome American values, and no catering to the artsy or Leftist crowd. In the mid-thirties, he became ""Director"" of what became the Lux Radio Theater (after a season or two of adapting  a broader range of theatricals. In fact, he was paid a very high salary for those days (and not a pittance even today when each dollar then would be worth in the neighborhood of 15) to come in for a few hours, one day a week, to rehearse and then participate in a live one hour broadcast from Hollywood. His work amounted to about five minutes of the hour broadcast. Not only did he earn  the salary but it was a perfect platform for him to become, for the general public, THE GREAT AMERICAN DIRECTOR.
This early talkie (his second)is a typical feature film for him. Claudette Colbert and Herbert Marshall carry the ""serious"" aspects with Mary Boland and William Gargan handling the roles with more comedic elements. Oh, yes, Leo Carrillo, played the native guide for the group. (Look him up, he not only had a long, successful, Hollywood career, but a TV one as well, beginning when he was 70. In Real Life, he was a very distinguished native Californian from one of the most distinguished families of Old and New California.)  One should see movie, if one is serious about knowing the history of the film and, not only the ARTISTIC history. For the less devoted , it is not a Bad movie, it is just not a good one. There is entertainment value, but it is unsophisticated. So, a bit of nostalgia for the Old Folks (over 75-perhaps) and a bit of fun for the younger crowd.",1338508800,2,2569,4.588235294117647
8485492,3,B005STRMXG,"Four people barely escape a plague ship. They head for the nearest island.  Little did they know that they were going for the frying pan into the fire. The island also has a plague and the only way out is through the jungle.  The journey through the jungle is a journey of discovery.  Each person gets a belated coming of age and focuses on life.

This may not be the film you suspect. Many of the reviews are misleading. Basically we have an odd collection of personalities.  The focus is on the mousy school teacher Judy Jones (Claudette Colbert) with each passing day changes as she loses glasses and lets down her hair. We even get a shower scene where Arnold Ainger (Herbert Marshall) rushes in and save Judy form getting pneumonia, as Stewart Corder (William Gargan) watches with tongue hanging out; or was that me?

Anyway who gets the girl? Probably cannibals.
And for some reason the native men just want to get rid of Mrs. Mardick (Mary Boland) and her little dog too.

Oh yes I guess I should mention that this is a Cecil B, DeMille production. His second sound Production.",1319241600,5,1084,4.556701030927835
