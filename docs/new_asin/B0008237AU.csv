Being from Buffalo, my friends and I had no clue who the guy was with the light up leather jacket, so we looked him up and his amazing story unfolded. This documentary was actually VERY entertaining. Hopefully the next time we're in Toronto for a show, we run into him again!",1362096000,,422,4.4935064935064934
8055471,4,B0008237AU,"Flyerman is as satisfying a documentary as you're likely to ever see about a ""normal"" human.  The filmmakers have their work cut out for them following Mark Vistorino for a 5 year chunk of life, where we meet the super ego of Flyerman. Vistorino is alternately crazy, brilliant, acerbic, charmless, charming, likeable and frustrating.  At times he sounds like an enlightened sage and at others it's hard to believe he is quite so naive on so many matters.

We follow his dreams, let downs, the endless frustration in his personal life, so sharply defined with the difficulties of ever communicating with his father in the way he'd like.  We meet a dear friend then listen as he grieves her death.  It's impossible not to care about this character and route for him.

I was absolutely captivated by Flyerman and even without ever having met Mr. Vistorino, feel as though I've made a new friend.  Not bad for a movie.",1122940800,,915,4.716981132075472
8055472,5,B0008237AU,"As Tan and Stephenson follow Flyerman over the course of five years, you find yourself rooting for the guy as he tries to break out of his cycle of bluster-turns-to-failure. But while at times sad, ultimately the film is uplifting. And it leaves you thinking about yourself, your own successes and failures. The film definitely ends on a strong up-note without going Hollywood on you.

I'm looking forward to the extras and commentary!",1118707200,3,435,4.958904109589041
8055473,5,B0008237AU,"I saw this film at the Toronto Film festival and it was fantastic. The filmmakers did a superb job of capturing the essence of this man, Flyerman. The film is funny, interesting, and ultimately heartbreaking. One of the best documentaries I've seen in years--glad to see it's on DVD!",1117065600,,283,4.795918367346939
