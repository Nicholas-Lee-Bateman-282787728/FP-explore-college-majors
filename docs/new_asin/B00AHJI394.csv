5424780,5,B00AHJI394,"There's a feeling that seems to be missing from movies these days. Tension, suspense, not knowing what's going to happen next. I like movies where I can't start watching knowing the good guys will win, the protagonist couple will get together by the end, or the like. Even a ""suspense thriller"" is pretty predictable these days, if it's big budget mainstream. I liked not knowing how 3 of a Kind was going to play out. I also liked that when all was played out, it did so logically. Suspension of disbelief is part and parcel of any movie experience, but less is required here. It's important to support efforts like this one, because the people who finance movies only see numbers. If you want intelligent movies, it's time to vote with your wallet.",1357603200,2,750,4.646616541353383
5424781,4,B00AHJI394,"If you like thrillers, you'll like Three of a Kind. Don't expect to anticipate where the story is going to go. The surprises along the way were fun. Great performance from Margot Kidder.",1357516800,,186,4.666666666666667
5424782,5,B00AHJI394,"I saw this movie last year. This movie was so good, the suspence in this movie,kept me at the edge of my seat. I would compare it to one of Alfred Hitchcock's movies.",1357516800,,166,4.0606060606060606
5424783,4,B00AHJI394,"As a film critic, I enjoy a good thriller with plenty of plot twists.  'Three of a Kind' fits the bill perfectly.  This film keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the story. Greg Green is a talented filmmaker.  He has assembled a young and talented ensemble cast with a cameo from veteran film star Margot Kidder.  If you're a fan of Film Noir, 'Three of a Kind' should be in your home entertainment collection.  It is a fun ride and I look forward to seeing future projects from this auteur.",1357430400,,500,4.333333333333333
5424784,5,B00AHJI394,"Three of a Kind is very exciting, on the edge of your seat kind of movie.  The build up has the Alfred Hitchcock type of
scary effect.  It gets very intense and ends with a twist you do not expect.  Well written, wonderfully acted and the music is awesome.  And to have it filmed locally is a plus. Thank you Gregory Green for making your movie in Boise!",1357430400,,354,4.161764705882353
5424785,5,B00AHJI394,This film is a rush of engagement and action.  The tangled narrative captures you and glues to your seat as you strap in for a wild journey.  This is a MUST SEE!,1357430400,,161,4.0
5424786,4,B00AHJI394,"This stylish thriller is a modern film noir with shadowy characters, secrets from the past and a plot that's driven by desire and revenge.  It's suspenseful, sexy and never loses its looming sense of danger.  Strong performances and sure-handed direction complete the package.  Check it out.",1357430400,,291,5.282608695652174
5424787,4,B00AHJI394,"I personally know the Director of this film and he is a fantastic film maker. We have worked together on several projects and he never ceases to astonish me with his work. The film has an excellent story line, fantastic character development, and is VERY well acted. The cast was fantastic and no one feels out of place. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, wondering how things will end. I found myself jumping to conclusions, simply because I desperately wanted to see how the film would end. Three of a Kind doesn't feel like an independent film, so don't be concerned. There are no cheesy moments, nor are there any dry moments. It is a very dramatic and tense movie that will have you craving more by the time it's over. An excellent production by an excellent team of film makers.",1357430400,,810,4.47972972972973

I didn't know who done it until the end.  This movie is an independent film but much better than most of the big studio ones I've seen lately.  3 of a Kind is original, and a poignant reminder that blockbuster does not mean better than independent. I was lucky enough to see it on the big screen first at the premier and watched it again.  AWESOME!!!!",1357430400,,613,5.714285714285714
5424789,3,B00AHJI394,"A suspenseful tale of a woman who plans her escape from her wife beater of a husband. Surprise ending, plus a nice appearance by Margot Kidder.",1499299200,,143,4.538461538461538
5424790,3,B00AHJI394,That whole car salesman scene towards the end was straight out of Hitchcocks... Psycho,1495324800,,86,5.214285714285714
5424791,5,B00AHJI394,"Totally enjoyed this thriller. Would liked to have seen a little more Kidder because I loved the importance of her role. Great acting and I was surprised by the outcome. Oh, and Jared Zirilli, need I say more?",1494892800,,209,4.526315789473684
5424792,5,B00AHJI394,"If you are in love with the psychological thrillers, then go and see it. This movie has very new kind of plot along with romance. I really enjoyed watching this movie.",1494460800,,167,4.419354838709677
5424793,2,B00AHJI394,"Aggressively average overall but the way it was shot, the lighting and bad green screen/CGI really pushed it out of being an okay movie in any way. It was about 20-30 minutes too long and overall pretty slow for a ""thriller"", which can sometimes be good but in this case it wasn't. The ending was pretty telegraphed, not only by the title but just in general really. When it wasn't really cheesy and overly dramatic or trying too hard to be clever, the writing wasn't actually all that bad, the story is just overused and overdone and in the instance of ""3 of a Kind"" it just fell flat for me. It just really felt like something that would be on Lifetime but couldn't quite make the cut; but if that does happen to be your thing, please do watch because you'll love it, this movie just wasn't for me.",1492128000,,800,4.34
5424794,3,B00AHJI394,"I wasn't too sure about the this movie in the beginning, but I definitely liked how the ending took a twist. I don't watch too many indie films but overall I thought the film was good.",1492041600,,184,4.138888888888889
5424795,5,B00AHJI394,"An entertaining thriller that is both character and plot driven. Movie plays out like a great page turner novel that you can not stop reading till the last page. It has been said that revenge is to live well but in this case you will want to see vengeance dispensed.
Great acting and cinematography. Clever title! Get the popcorn ready, a nice beverage and enjoy!",1491868800,,363,4.6
5424796,4,B00AHJI394,"I really enjoyed the look and tone of this movie. The music is strong too. Part Godfather/part Enough. Quite of lot of characters to add layers to the story. A story is only as good as its villain, and we have a good one here.",1491782400,,226,4.044444444444444
5424797,4,B00AHJI394,"I will trynot to use any spoilers. More than a  decent movie to watch. If you have seen most or any of the good/great thrillers/dark comedy films of the last decade or so , you may not be surprised. It does have a deep sincere emotional core to it that makes watching it rewarding...The things people do the people they say they love can be quite unsettling.",1491782400,,358,4.343283582089552
5424798,5,B00AHJI394,"I think this movie was pretty good.  The husband did deserve what happened to him.  But I really wasn't expecting for everyone to turn on him. Anyway, good suspense and good story.",1491696000,,180,4.59375

5424800,4,B00AHJI394,"3 of a Kind was a fun watch. How nice it was seeing Margot Kidder and that she's still got it! production value was excellent. beautifully shot, had great locations, and the lead actress was spot on. I did guess the ending but only because I read somewhere that I never would, lol, which forced me to focus on every clue. I liked the sparse dialogue which gave the actors room to actually act... show the story rather than tell it. a great way to spend a lazy weekend!",1489276800,2,468,4.269662921348314

5424825,3,B00AHJI394,"I have to give a shout out to  Tom Adams for playing a perfect abusive villain in this. At times I wanted to jump through the screen and strangle  Victor myself. It was clear from the beginning with the montage of clips fast forwarding their relationship that the wife was in for a rough ride. The story does however, drag on quite a bit and I had a bit of a hard time understanding some of the conversation because the sound was sketchy to me in places.

5424827,1,B00AHJI394,"Within a few minutes I was hoping it would turn into a horror movie and would have her torturing him right away..I don't even like horror films. I don't know why I watched all the way up til 30 minutes til the end. It was disturbing to see the glimpses of Victors childhood it still didn't help me empathise with his character. As obsessive as he was he would have never gotten her a young good looking chauffeur, unless he wanted an extra excuse to beat her. He would have tracking on the vehicle and on the drivers phone. There would be cameras inside the home no doubt..and so much more that would coincide with his personality traits. He would not have been eager to have sex with her while she was being dominant while he had just got home from murdering her boyfriend after showing promiscuous photos of them together. No matter how drunk he would not have fallen for that. He would want to kill her.....THEN her handcuffing him??? No way, after what he saw in his childhood of the terror in his sisters eyes when she had been tied up there is no way he would think this is sensual fun. He would totally freak!!

It was so poorly done that it may get a cult status as one of the worst movies ever made. I do hope that Joel Hodges can be alerted of this movies existence so he can do his thing in Mystery Science Theatre 3000 and have some fun with it. If you're a director, do you really let performances like these actors get by as passable? Huffing glue or paint I would guess. ""Wow, great job, you totally nailed it.

This is a movie that in spots is so bad it's good. However, because it is advertised as an edgy psych-thriller I have to give it 1 star. It is neither edgy nor thrilling. It is a wretched cheese-fest plagued by horrible acting and bad special effects. When the plane exploded near the beginning my wife and I howled with laughter.

Of course movie ratings are all subjective and a matter of taste and opinion, but its hard to believe that this disjointed script, with bad dialogue, poor acting, along with so many other negatives as far as movie making goes, could have drawn good reviews from anyone not connected with this project.

5425314,5,B00AHJI394,"""Three Of A Kind"" is a suspenseful, well acted and beautifully shot movie set in Chicago with stunning cinematography reminiscent of Gordon Willis' groundbreaking work in ""The Godfather."".  Anna seems to have a fairytale marriage to a handsome, wealthy businessman named Victor.  But in their fifteen years of marriage, Anna discovers that all is not as it seems.  Not only is Victor a ruthless drug smuggler, he is an abusive husband.  This movie realistically portrays the paranoia and aberrant behaviors associated with domestic violence and mental abuse, perfectly mapping Anna and Victor's ""cycle of violence,"" undoubtedly a national epidemic plaguing our country today.  Victor and his elder sister's abusive childhood is hinted at in various flashbacks and gives some insight into his psyche, putting his present behavior in context.  Notwithstanding, Victor is suave and cool with very menacing undertones which makes his character incredibly frightening.  With all the evil he exudes, he has one redeeming character trait:  His close emotional, affectionate and protective relationship with his older, wheelchair bound sister, played heartbreakingly well by Margot Kidder.  Anna, however, is not one to take abuse lying down.  She eventually finds the strength to deal with her husband's violence but you'll need to watch this movie from beginning to end to see how she eventually handles the matter.  This movie is well rounded by competent, sympathetic, supporting characters.  This should be required viewing for any man or woman currently embroiled in an abusive relationship.  Sometimes one has to see it from the outside in to realize there's a problem.",1359504000,,1668,5.443579766536965

5425362,5,B00AHJI394,Three of a Kind is the perfect movie for anyone who enjoys a film that keeps him on the edge of his seat.  This movie rivals the intensity of any Hitchcock. The twists and turns in this movie are incredible; there is definitely no predictability or pat resolution.  Margot Kidder is outstanding in her role.  I look forward to seeing more films by the talented Greg Green.,1357689600,,372,4.522388059701493
