Teenage Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) lives in her own fantasy world and resents having to take care of her younger brother Toby (Toby Froud son of Conceptual Designer Brian Froud.)  She wishes that the Goblin King (David Bowie) who is enamored with her would take Toby away now. Be careful of what you wish for. Toby is whisked off to the goblin King's castle beyond the goblin city and behind a great labyrinth. Now Sarah has just 13 hours to navigate the labyrinth and retrieve Toby if that is what she wants.

We get to travel with Sarah through all over trials and tribulations. We get to kibitz don't go this way don't go that way. And you guessed it Sarah does go this way and Sarah does go that way. In the meantime she learns what friendship and fairness is all about and gains a new respect for her new and old friends.

This is Jennifer Connelly's third film before quitting the industry to go to college. Of course she is back now and a stronger actress than ever.

I've seen this presentation on TV and on VHS. However for some reason I forgot that it was really a musical fantasy even though I knew it had David Bowie. Now with the advent of Blu-Ray I am revisiting all the old films and this one came up on the list. The visuals are spectacular. The voiceover gives you new insights as to what they were trying to do on the movie. Occasionally especially at first it looks like the characters are lip-synching and the sound does not match exactly. Later this is either corrected or you don't notice it anymore.

8330025,4,B001OAN6SI,"A child is kidnapped, and the only way for his sister to save him is to navigate a bizarre magical labyrinth... and confront the Goblin King.

That's the simple premise behind ""Labyrinth,"" a coming-of-age fantasy set in a very odd fantasy world. It rests partly on the acting talents of David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly, but also on the glorious sets and special effects -- and the sense that we've been thrown into a world where magic is dangerous and wild. At times it's a bit too silly, but the overall effect is a magnificently otherworldly one.

Teenage Sarah (Connelly) loves to lose herself in fantastical daydreams, so she's irritated to be stuck babysitting her crying baby stepbrother. But after she idly wishes that the goblins would steal him... it actually happens. Then the Goblin King Jareth (Bowie) challenges her -- she has only thirteen hours to navigate a hazardous, ever-changing maze. If she fails, her brother will be a goblin himself.

As she rushes through the Labyrinth, Sarah encounters a grumpy dwarf named Hoggle (Brian Henson), a gentle beast, a vulpine knight (David Shaughnessy) and many other bizarre creatures who help and/or hinder her. Jareth himself is trying to sabotage her progress -- but no longer just because of the child. Now he's become fascinated by Sarah, and wants her to be his forever.

""Labyrinth"" was not a commercial success when it was first released, and in fact caused Jim Henson to fall into a depression because he had hoped for better. But it's not hard to see why it became a cult success -- it's a hybrid of ""The Dark Crystal"" and ""Alice in Wonderland,"" melding a fantasy quest with a coming-of-age journey. And of course, it has David Bowie as a rock'n'roll goblin. Who couldn't love that?

Henson brought the Labyrinth world to life exquisitely -- it's set in a maze of crumbling walls, with vast statues, guttering candles, weeds and branches, pits filled with talking hands, hedge mazes, swamps, a medieval village and an eerie masque that threatens t bespell Sarah. While much of the setting is earthy and solid, there's still a glittering, eerie sense of dangerous yet beautiful things that might appear out of nowhere.

Perhaps the movie's biggest flaw is its goofy streak -- such as the self-dismembering Fireys -- when it works best as a semi-serious piece. But the writing is excellent, a mixture of sublime prettiness (""Everything I've done, I've done for you. I move the stars for no one"") and goofiness (""Oh don't act so smart. You don't even know what an oubliette is"").

And ""Labyrinth"" wouldn't work at all without the presence of Bowie and Connelly, both of whom give excellent performances. While it's a bit squicky to see a clearly adult Jareth falling for a teenage girl, Bowie is a mass of charisma and cruel elegance, and his wild hair and tight pants give him that rock'n'roll edge. And Connelly has a fresh-faced innocence that makes Sarah seem... well, like a romantic-minded girl who chafes at caring for a weepy baby.

""Labyrinth"" is a bit too silly at times, but it also has an unearthly beauty, amazing use of puppets and sets, and two powerful lead performances. Definitely a must-see for the fantasy fan.",1404172800,,3196,4.84065934065934
