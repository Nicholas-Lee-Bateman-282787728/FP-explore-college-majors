3454794,4,B001AMU6AG,Vincent Price does a wonderful job of narration introduction of the movie. It was not as long of a movie as  i would have liked but was entertaining anyway..,1349740800,,157,4.413793103448276
3454795,4,B001AMU6AG,"I love the story to begin with and have been seeking different styles and remakes.  This one, though old fashioned, was a true to the letter depiction of the wonderful classic tale.  I enjoyed it very much.",1348617600,,206,4.54054054054054
3454796,5,B001AMU6AG,"Having Vincent Price as narrator caught my attention which led me to purchase this early TV version. He reads from a book, then the scene switches to the actors. Surprizingly well done. I recommend it for those who, like myself, collect various renditions of the old classic, or anyone who likes Vincent Price. Seeing him as a gentle storyteller rather than in some horror scene was rather refreshing and unique.",1345593600,8,412,4.9
3454797,3,B001AMU6AG,This is Jill St. John's first film role - and not in her credits in IMDB.  She plays one of Cratchit's daughters as Jill (different last name).  Vincent is supposed to be wicked cutting in his narration.  I will be seeing soon!!,1335484800,,228,4.380952380952381
3454798,4,B001AMU6AG,"For those with a nostalgic spot in their heart for Vincent Price, the frequent cuts to his narration make this a ""good buy"". The story line itself is somewhat changed and adapted to a short tv spot, the main character a little too ""emotive"", but still worth the view!",1265760000,,267,4.469387755102041
3454799,3,B001AMU6AG,"Filmed for TV in 1949, this short story is an abridged version of Dickens' classic work. Most viewers today would not care for this version. It is obviously low budget (even for 1949), and I'm sure the biggest expense was paying Vincent Price to narrate it (which he does very well--as always). Never the less, it is an example of very early television, and it does get the story told.

Amazingly, even though the film is less than 30 minutes long, the important aspects of the story are included. The acting is not always that great. I wasn't too impressed with the first two ""ghosts"", nor with Marley.

Special effects are non existent except for a thunder-like sound and black-out transitions. It is interesting to note that Dicken's original story does mention the loud thundering/echoing sound of doors as Marley's Ghost approached. This was probably the producers one attempt to add some kind of effects, loosely taken from the pages of the book itself. It doesn't work very well, however. Never the less, I will be watching it again.

Even though this made for early TV film isn't a showcase of exceptional workmanship, it is never the less an interesting addition to the Christmas Carol collection. For those that are either collectors of Christmas Carol films, or those who enjoy early TV (even when it isn't done very well), it's a great DVD to have. By the way, Scrooge is played by Taylor Holmes. The story was adapted by, and directed by Arthur Pierson.",1261785600,29,1466,4.7637795275590555
3454800,3,B001AMU6AG,"After stumbling across this version on Amazon, it was purchased and recently viewed.  It isn't the best version, but I'm glad I bought it as a collector of the older versions.

I guess I enjoyed watching it, but the Scrooge character, well, I don't know what to make of this performance really.  I don't really know how to describe the Taylor Holmes portrayal other than... it's different.",1260835200,13,389,4.776119402985074
3454801,4,B001AMU6AG,"While not HD clean and sharp, I found this version to be the cleanest, sharpest, and best transfer of this 60-year-old TV show thus far.  I've seen several from public domain distributors.  Sure, its production value is unsophisticated...after all, it's 1949.  It's not fair to judge this television version of Dickens' Christmas Carol by the numerous film studio versions.

It's historic and certainly worth owning, as an earlier reviewer noted.",1254787200,43,446,5.328571428571428
3454802,3,B001AMU6AG,"When I received my copy of this DVD, I was surprised to discover that neither the ""jewel case"" nor the DVD listed any member of the cast, except Vincent Price, the narrator.  His portrait fills the front cover of the ""jewel case,"" and there is a thumbnail of this portrait on the disc.  Although Vincent Price was a famous actor, may he R.I.P., I thought it odd that he, being the narrator, rather than playing the protagonist, Scrooge, was the only member of the cast even mentioned on the cover, until I watched the movie.

Vincent Price's performance is a stellar example of why his name and portrait are used to market this DVD.  His narration, given intermittently as the camera cuts to and focuses on him, is the most spectacular part of this movie.  It gave me the impression that he had memorized the entire novel.

The only thing I remember about any of the other footage is that it's more abominable than Dr. Phibes!  Except for the footage of Vincent Price narrating this tale, this movie screams, ""Low budget, black and white!""  The only version I've seen of ""A Christmas Carol"" that I consider worse is the version produced in 1910, which is not only black and white, but silent, as well.

In the years to come, I will probably play this DVD over and over again just to show off Vincent Price's talent, fast-forwarding through the parts he doesn't appear in.

I only recommend this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" to two groups of people:

1)  hardcore fans of Vincent Price, and
2)  collectors of various versions of ""A Christmas Carol""",1231804800,141,1549,4.609489051094891
3454803,5,B001AMU6AG,Absolutely wonderful. My grandson loved it. I've been trying to get him interested in Dickens for 2 years  and he finally paid attention.,1483056000,,137,4.956521739130435

3454806,4,B001AMU6AG,"This is a good account of The Christmas Carol. It is not always super clear as it is old but the acting was good.

3454807,1,B001AMU6AG,"I did not care for this version at all.  I know it's old and Vincent Price is awesome, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  I love the full-length original movie and the one from the 50's, but this one I really did not like at all.",1482969600,,231,3.893617021276596
3454808,3,B001AMU6AG,"It is short and to the point. The main storyline was covered and Vincent Price is always intriguing, but as a fan of the whole story, I prefer the longer version.

3454817,2,B001AMU6AG,The story is about redemption but you never see it as this is so abbreviated!  The director spends too much time on the beginning than on his gradual change over the span of the 3 ghosts revelations.  The only good part in this is hearing and seeing Vincent Price as the narrator.,1482019200,3,280,4.365384615384615

3454828,3,B001AMU6AG,"I was fascinated by the fact that they told the story effectively in 25 minutes and a young Vincent Price did a fine job with narration, however, the acting was poor.

3454853,1,B001AMU6AG,"I cannot recommend this particular version of Dickens' ""Christmas Carol"" because I have seen other versions of the property that I found more interesting and which drew me into the story as it was told.  This is in no way to suggest that other viewers might not find it to their liking.  My impression is that this might be a good vehicle for introducing ""Christmas Carol"" to younger viewers since it would spare them the more spine-tingling visits from Marley, the Lost Souls and the specters of Christmas Past, Present and Future, appearances done so well in other versions of the tale.",1420416000,,588,4.754901960784314
3454854,3,B001AMU6AG,"This 1949 version of Charles Dickens Christmas Carol is possibly one of the worst produced. (My favorite ""oldie"" is the one starring Alastair Simm. My favorite ""newbie"" is the one starring George C. Scott.)  I love Vincent Price, but he just doesn't come across well as the story teller in this film. (Perhaps, because I am too likely to envision  him in an Edgar A. Poe reading.) Taylor Holmes (E. Scrooge) did well in his role.  The Ghosts were particularly awful.  All the other actors were just okay.  However, I found this version to be quirky in it's little 25 minute broadcast (for which I was grateful that it did only last 25 minutes.)

3454898,3,B001AMU6AG,"This was okay. Super short and skips through much of the story. Vincent Price just narrates the story, he isn't apart of the play. I was expecting something a little better.",1390435200,,173,4.612903225806452
3454899,4,B001AMU6AG,"This is an old and very short movie of A Christmas Carol read in part by Vincent Price with actors depicting other parts of the book.  I own a large collection of A Christmas Carol on DVD and VHS, so this was very interesting to me.  Watching Vincent Price read from the novel was priceless.  If you like the story of A Christmas Carol and think Vincent Price is worth seeing in a different light, then this would be well worth buying and adding to your collection or watching as part of Amazon Prime.",1390003200,,501,4.308510638297872

So let it go at that.  Is it a great adaptation, no.  It is very mediocre and brief.  It is not bad enough to detract from the overall gestalt, which is about a three.",1389139200,,329,4.158730158730159
3454903,1,B001AMU6AG,Maybe worth a laugh? Seeing Vincent Price read Dickens as the narrator was interesting. The rest is pure aweful! Fortunately it's less than 30 minutes.,1389139200,,151,5.08

3454905,5,B001AMU6AG,I was browsing Instant Prime and came upon this.  Wish it were longer.  Vincent Price has the most amazing style and voice and Ebenezer Scrooge managed to make the part his own despite the major edits needed to tell the tale in such a short time.,1388793600,,246,4.326086956521739
3454906,4,B001AMU6AG,As a TV narration it is excellent... it is short which is perfect for children. and the moral is clearly expressed in an entertaining way,1388793600,,137,4.52
3454907,3,B001AMU6AG,it was a cliff notes movie of the Christmas Carol. But you can't argue with the voice of the narrator.,1388707200,,102,4.15
3454908,5,B001AMU6AG,Some yrs back I began a collection of as many versions/pastiches of this Dickens classic as I could. I was delighted to find this rarity from radiola w/ the late great Vincent Price narrating this timeless classic. I also found a great deal on Stingiest man in Town from 1956 TV which starred the late actor Sir Basil Rathbone as Scrooge in an early Carol musical. It was not until 1970 when Al Finney's Scrooge the Musical that this tale had been musicalized. A few years ago Kelsey Grammar (The very first Geico gecko voicer) reprised the Scrooge role in another musical. In 2004 I myself wrote a dream sequence pastiche of Carol for one of my key characters in fanfictions (Kei's Dream Sequences from Xmas with the Dirty Pair. This year I wrote a new complete (5 Staves like Dickens) fanfiction tale Yuri Donovan's Xmas Carol- AD 2255. I believe mine is the only pastiche ever done with Scrooge as a female hired killer in the 23rd Century! In 1978 the late actor Jack Palance played in Ebenezer a TV film where Scrooge was a gunfighter in the old West. I was inspired by a fellow anime buff who made an anime video based on Carol with Gaara a Ninja from Naruto anime TV series as Scrooge. If anyone knows of any rare pastiches or films or TV specials of this old classic I'd appreciate a holler at keiman0@yahoo.com Oh and I am always open to suggestions for my writings.

3454910,3,B001AMU6AG,"Clocking in at only 25 minutes long this isn't the most thorough take on Dickens' tale, but it's well acted and entertaining.
It opens with Vincent Price relaxing in his living room, and after a brief intro he proceeds to read us the tale of a Christmas Carol. Worth a watch for a quick blast of holiday goodness.",1388361600,,313,4.413793103448276
3454911,3,B001AMU6AG,"This was worth watching because it was narrated by Vincent Price, and it was free with my Amazon Prime. The acting is bad, but it was interesting because it was an early television show in black and white.",1388275200,,205,4.421052631578948
3454912,5,B001AMU6AG,"I chose this rating because any version of Christmas Carol is a good version.
I love this story. This version is short and sweet and gets the point across.
Fun to see the old B/W movies too.",1388275200,,190,4.162162162162162

3454916,5,B001AMU6AG,"First, Vincent Price does not star in this version.  He is the narrator and he does his usual terrific job. This version of the story is complete and does not feel hurried at 25 minutes!  I would recommend this to educators that want to offer their class a little Christmas lesson in 40 minutes or less as my husband does. This is also good for people that love this story and want to see all it's incarnations.",1388016000,,411,4.324675324675325
3454917,2,B001AMU6AG,This is not nearly the best or even an average rendition of this story. I had thought that Mr Price might make a very interesting Scrooge.  However he was only the intro to the story with occasional drop in cameos.  Although I love the story and have seen it done many ways this one will be part of that group that I never bother to revisit.,1387929600,,341,4.151515151515151
3454918,1,B001AMU6AG,Too short. Acting was terrible. In Black and White. Didn't make much sense. Don't bother watching this. Not worth your time.,1387670400,,124,4.9523809523809526
3454919,1,B001AMU6AG,This older version of Dickens' famous story was disappointing.  It was very short and the acting left a lot to be desired.  It was nice to see a young Vincent Price doing the narrating though.,1387497600,4,192,4.457142857142857

3454921,4,B001AMU6AG,"Young Vincent Price reading an abbreviated Scrooge tale! What could be better. It's only about a half hour; so if you don't like it, no big loss. You might expect to see this kind of acting in a silent movie. Definitely beyond retro, but completely enjoyable in a campy kind of way.",1387324800,,282,4.4423076923076925
3454922,2,B001AMU6AG,"The Vincent Price narration is OK, but the presentation looks like a low budget made-for-B&W-TV version of the great story. I was hoping Amazon would post one of the great renditions for Prime members but I guess they blew the budget on their lousy WashDC insult-a-thon. Back to Netflix.",1387324800,,287,4.877551020408164

3454924,5,B001AMU6AG,It's classic! We loved it because of th dtyle and old fashioned movie. Watch it for sure- merry Christmas to all,1387152000,,112,4.380952380952381
3454925,4,B001AMU6AG,It was an interesting very old flick.  The actors were good and it was fun to see the age old story as it was perceived so long ago.,1387065600,,132,3.7142857142857144
3454926,3,B001AMU6AG,Very low budget production but I love the story and will watch any movie or TV production they make. Vicent Price is just the presenter and would like to have him as an actor in the movie.,1386979200,,188,4.108108108108108
3454927,1,B001AMU6AG,"When I saw this listed on Amazon's instant video list and read that it was narrated by Vincent Price I thought ""Oh wow, I've never seen this one. This might be pretty good."" And boy was I wrong. I'm sorry, but ""A Christmas Carol"" is not a story that can be told in a 25 minute movie. This version felt rushed and the acting was horrid. I prefer the 1938 black and white version or the 1984 version with George C. Scott. Those are so much better and far more enjoyable. I remember as a kid seeing the 80's version and actually being afraid of George C. Scott as Scrooge. Stick to those two versions.",1386979200,,598,4.208695652173913

3454929,2,B001AMU6AG,"This is a pretty weak rendition of the story. Not only are the visits cut short from the other versions, but the acting us mediocre at best. Don't spend your time here.",1385856000,,168,4.28125
3454930,5,B001AMU6AG,"A short telling of the book A Christmas Carol.  A young Vincent Price narrates inbetween scenes.  Acting is good.  Sets are basic but a good telling of the story.

3454932,4,B001AMU6AG,"Surprisingly, not bad for a half-hour, made-for-TV film.  The acting is okay, and Vincent Price is always fun to listen to as the narrator.  Needless to say, the story is chopped down to only the barest essentials, but it was one of TV's first adaptations, which along with British movies, made the Dickens Classic mandatory reading and/or viewing for the Christmas season.",1375660800,,373,5.0

3454938,1,B001AMU6AG,"Okay, so it's old. Beyond old ... petrified. The only reason I bothered is because I love Vincent Price, & he's very amusing. But if you're looking for acting, he does none but narration, & the other characters are terrible. Granted, cramming a whole book into what amounts to merely 25 minutes is next to impossible, so that's pretty well what you got ... next to impossible. The entire episode has turned green, as it was in black & white, but I guess even the film editor got bilious when viewing it.
Buy it if you're a collector, but if you're looking for decent Dickens, pass this turkey by.",1359331200,,596,4.477064220183486
3454939,2,B001AMU6AG,"I have 10 copies of this tale, and they are much newer. I suppose I was expecting more from this copy.

3454941,2,B001AMU6AG,"Although a fan of Vincent Price; I'm a much bigger fan of Charles Dickens and this telling of A Christmas Carol is unworthy of the author. Vincent Price does an acceptable job of reading his score, but trying to condense this classic work into something less than 25 mins is just not a good idea. Scrooge's performance is decent, but watch out for some of the poorest quality polder gist ever to claim the stage in telling this tale. It begins with a Jacob Marley that has little if any signs of death or the grave and looks more like a hardware salesmen than a haunting spirit! This sorry excuse for a ghost is followed by another less than haunting spirit of Christmas past, which quickly shows a single scene of Scrooges past and then threatens poor old scrooge with another scene, but never delivers. The following spirit of Christmas present was awful. Rather than jolly and full of good cheer this dismal frowning ghost is a real downer! Our final ghost looks more like an berka wearing arab than a grim reaper.

Save your 25 minutes and invest in another rendition of this classic tale, you'll thank me for it.",1354579200,,1117,4.557213930348259
