8290019,5,B001CUB5GK,"This DVD was excellent!  The DVD covers quiet well the Dalton's and the Coffeyville raid in 1892.  I really like that the History Channel DVD included a computerized town of Coffeyville the way it was layed out in 1892, with  computerized people, to show how the Daltons robbed the banks and where they went when everything fell apart for them. There are even photos of the Daltons on this DVD after the raid.  Really enjoy the narrator's voice with this DVD too.

Before buying this DVD I was very interested in the Dalton gang alone but after buying this DVD it also made me appreciate the town's people who died at the hands of the Dalton's. I didn't reallize just how violent this raid was for the people who defended Coffeyville that horrible day!

I give this video, in my book, a A+++!  Highly recommended for anyone that loves to read about the Dalton gang or love old west history.",1230076800,3,890,4.525
