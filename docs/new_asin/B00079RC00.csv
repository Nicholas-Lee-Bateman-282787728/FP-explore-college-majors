2206640,5,B00079RC00,"Odds are that if you're reading this you already know who Ray Harryhausen is and you've heard about this DVD.  If that's the case, then you may as well click on ""Add to Shopping Cart"" or ""Pre-order this item"" right now (depending on when you're reading this).

If you don't know who Ray Harryhausen is, he made (amongst other things) ""Clash of the Titans"" and the Sinbad films that you probably saw when you were a kid (that's Sinbad the sailor, not the comedian :-) ).  He's also the main inspiration to virtually *everyone* who's currently in the Hollywood visual effects industry.

This 2-disc set has some items that have appeared elsewhere, but the versions here are more complete, visually better (most coming from the original negatives), and for those that didn't have a musical score (such as tests and experiments) one has been created (by noted film composers Bill Stromberg and John Morgan).  It also contains the complete Mother Goose and Fairy Tales series, including the recently completed ""Tortise and the Hare.""

This is a unique and highly recommended set.",1105833600,61,1074,4.906077348066298
2206653,2,B00079RC00,I believed this DVD would be the movies itself but it was clips and how they were created. I was upset as it was a gift.,1214784000,6,120,3.6538461538461537
2206654,4,B00079RC00,"very classic and old, if you're collecting Ray H. movies, this one is a must. But if you just want old movies, you might not like it that much, this one are a collection of his first movie special effects clips, you might want to consider the other 2 box collections available here in amazon too, which i also happen to have, their nice good old movies and classic too. Search for Ray Harryhausen.",1168560000,,397,4.378378378378378
2206655,5,B00079RC00,"Ray Harryhausen is a genius. One of those very rare artists who created unforgettable movie images, frame by frame.

This opportunity to discover his early work is wonderful and will delight his many fans around the world.",1140220800,,222,5.0
2206656,4,B00079RC00,It has the greatest amount of poignancy and depth of characterization and visually it is the most impressive. Hansel and Gretel is another good one but the kids and father in the story are all a little too Germanic looking to be that appealing.,1137801600,2,244,4.568181818181818
2206657,5,B00079RC00,"For young animators just getting started, this collection is a must-see. Ray Harryhausen, whose feature film effects work (i.e. Clash of the Titans) is known and studied by all types of animators, also has a slate of early work that is equally inspiring. These short films, based on well-known fairy tales like ""Little Miss Muffet,"" were made simply with low budgets, using in-camera effects. One of the signature methods Ray used was in-camera dissolves (fading one image out while fading another image in), for changes of facial expression on replacement sculpted heads. The puppets were carefully crafted by the whole Harryhausen family--dad made the armatures, mom made the costumes. While Ray eventually had the opportunity to learn from stop-motion master Willis O'Brien, these early independent films are where he developed his own style and innovations through experimentation. As such they are an invaluable resource as inspiration to stop-motion animators today.",1126224000,11,972,5.486666666666666
2206658,5,B00079RC00,"As a fan of Ray, I was so happy to get my hand on this. I bought it for the mature film lover in myslef, but my three year old sister loves to watch the fairy tales and nursery rhymes.  It is superb in every way.",1123545600,4,212,3.608695652173913
2206659,4,B00079RC00,"Remember the cartoon movie, Monsters, Inc.,where the coolest nightclub in town was called Harryhausen's? That choice of name was homage to this brilliant innovator in animation and movie-making, Ray Harryhausen. Maybe he didn't invent stop animation, but he pushed the technology to heights no one could have imagined.

These are samples of his early work, from the days before he was ""discovered,"" while he was developing his techniques and building a portfolio. The first part of this collection includes eight of his realizations of fairy tales and Mother Goose stories. They are all very charming stories, even if the stories and visual style look nave by today's standards. In part, that was deliberate - he cleaned up some of the more violent moments, like the woodsman's rescue of Red Riding Hood and Grandma, to suit the tastes of his audiences of the 1940s and 1950s. The ninth piece in this set is an interesting collaboration. Decades after Harryhausen set ""The Tortoise and the Hare"" aside, unfinished, some fans contacted him about it. He still had the original puppets, which he let them use in completing the work. I'm glad he consented, since the product came out seamlessly.

Harryhausen also prototyped some ads and WWII training films, trying to interest potential employers in his work. The commercial work didn't hold my interest but ""How to Bridge a Gorge"" and a tribute to the Guadalcanal victory certainly did. Those two employed similar style, with no human characters shown but with bridges and buildings mysteriously assembling themselves. The rest of the set includes very brief experimental segments and historical notes. They're a mixed bag, in terms of topic, style, and degree of interest.

This collection might not be for the mainstream movie fan. If you're a Harryhausen devotees or someone interested in the history of moviemaking, it's a valuable contribution.

2206660,5,B00079RC00,"This collection is a love letter to Ray Harryhausen from his fans. In the wonderful documentary ""The Harryhausen Chronicles"", we see snipets of the fairy tales, the lost projects, War of the Worlds animated Martian, Army films, etc.  The first DVD has all the footage for all of these subjects.  The second disc contains interviews, tributes, Harryhausen in Hollywood, a reunion with Rad Bradbury. The running time is almost 4 hours for both discs, and is well worth the price. I'm preaching to the choir here, because if you don't know Harryhausen, you should get to know him by watching his films. Start with Jason and the Argonauts and work your way through to Clash of the Titans. When you consider ALL OF THESE EFFECTS were done by hand by one man, Harryhausen puts today's computer programmers to shame. I enjoy computer animation in films as much as the next person, but it's not as impressive when you consider the human touch is all but lost.",1108598400,23,951,4.72289156626506
2206661,5,B00079RC00,"If you're a big fan of Ray Harryhausen -- and what movie lover isn't? -- then you've probably already heard about and maybe even picked up this excellent 2-disc set dedicated to his early (pre-1953) work.  If you haven't picked it up yet, then I urge you to do so immediately.  As the other two reviewers have noted, this set's centerpieces are Ray's charming Mother Goose Stories and Fairy Tales, along with experimental training films for the army and some commercials.  These shorts have been restored beautifully and are accompanied by brief but informative intros from the master himself.

Taken as a whole, however, the set is also a retrospective -- sort of a companion piece to Ray's own recent autobiography.  There are plenty of extras (interviews and such) from the last five years, demonstrating just how fully Ray has been receiving his well-deserved kudos.  If that isn't enough, then check out the brief snippets of projects that Ray left incomplete for various reasons, including test footage for an alien from War of the Worlds.  (And how tantalizing and compelling are those sketches and test footage for The Elementals?  What a shame it was never picked up!  It looks like it might have been Ray's darkest and most stylized film.)

No real complaints.  Just be aware that the 50-odd-year-old 16mm shorts show a little wear and tear, despite the restoration work.  (A couple of credit sequences appear to be cropped, but it doesn't show in the films themselves.)  There's also a little repetition in some of the extras, but the extras themselves focus pretty consistently on the material in the set.  This was obviously a labor of love for everyone involved (especially Harryhausen himself), and it promises to be the best special interest DVD of the year!  Very highly recommended!",1107907200,15,1800,4.953333333333333
2206662,5,B00079RC00,"This 2-disk set is a comprehensive collection of the early works of legendary stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen.  It includes restored versions of his Mother Goose Stories and Fairy Tales, military training films, commercials, and tests and experiments for unproduced projects.  These films are both important for their historical value, and entertaining in and of themselves.  The development of Ray's artistry both as an animator and as a storyteller is displayed here.  Extras include featurettes, tributes, and image galleries.  [...]",1107043200,24,541,5.7974683544303796
8046317,4,B00079RC00,"Anyone reading this review must be interested in Stop Motion's Master of Majicks Ray Harryhausen. I've been a fan long before I know who he was. Watching his early black & white films on Creature Feature in the early 60's, seeing many of his early color films at my local theater matinee and even in my very early school years seeing the fairy tales included on this 2 disc DVD set.

If you're a fan of Ray Harryhausen, then this will probably be of great interest to you. This set included all five of his fairy tales, plus the newly completed Tortoise and the Hare short that he never completed. The shorts look better than they ever have and they are complete. The finished Tortoise and the Hare short is amazing to see. Using the original figures and camera, the two new animator's with Ray's guidance and him actually animating a sequence,  the original and new footage blends seamlessly, it's virtually impossible to detect where the original ends and the new footage begins.

The shorts include introductions by RH himself, a commentary for the Tortoise and the Hare short, early test footage of projects that never came to fruition ( Evolution, War of the Worlds etc.) and much more. The early years kind of houses all those little treasures that didn't make their way to one of Ray's DVD or Blu Ray releases. Ray receiving his star on the Hollywood walk of Fame, interviews, clips, sketches, stills gallery and all sorts of interesting little nuggets from the man's amazing career. Each disc runs around 2 hours, I wish they had included The Harryhausen Chronicles and Aliens, Dragons, Monsters & Me on this set, Neither have seen a proper DVD release.

Overall this is a fantastic set and I am very happy with the quality, I think if it had included more documentaries it would have given it more replay value. I will revisit the fairy tales from time to time, but the ceremonies and other tidbits are bonus features and not feature presentations. Certainly a welcome addition, but hardly the type of stuff that makes up the lion share of an entire disc.

I have owned this set for years and I see that it is listed for a hefty price here, look around as it is priced much lower on other sites. Prices ranging from $9.99 used (excellent condition) to $34.99 new",1491436800,,2271,4.625310173697271

8046320,5,B00079RC00,A marvelous collection of Ray Harryhausen's early work and test projects. Almost all of them I had heard of befpre. Also more extras included. All of it done with impeccable professionalism. I had no problems.,1411862400,,209,5.0
8046321,5,B00079RC00,This set is fantastic.  As a collector of Ray Harryhausen films this was the last piece of the puzzle and truly the jewel of my collection.

8046322,5,B00079RC00,"I love these fairytales so I must give them 5 stars. But I did find out from the folks at Harryhausen.com that they plan on releasing the fairytales again in 2014 or 2015 with a new narration track with actress Caroline Munro with a commentary by Nick Park. They will also keep the old narration as well. Keep an eye on the website for more info. If you can wait a little, then you don't have to pay these crazy prices.",1386806400,,419,4.185185185185185
8046323,5,B00079RC00,"This was certainly a differant purchasing experience for me! I ordered RAY HARRYHAUSEN THE EARLY YEARS COLLECTION a few weeks ago, but only yesterday July 18, 2013 was when I was able to watch and enjoy it!! The reason for that is because the 1st dvd copy I received was a region 2 copy and that is not compatible with my North American DVD RAM recorder! I thought I clicked my mouse onto a ""all regions"" 2- disc copy of that title but the $14.04 priced DVD set is a ""region 2"" recording from seller MovieMars! The one that I got yesterday is ""all regions"" from Sellingmycollections on Amazon.com! And that one cost $83.99 plus $3.99 for shipping and handling! The ones available after I bought my copy cost even more! I don't think it's fair that these sellers are charging much more for  the region 1 recordings then the region 2 DVDs! But I am a collecter of animation titles of hand crafted animation as well as being an animater of my own hand drawn videos. And I enjoyed buying and watching Disney's SILLY SYMPHONIES vol 1 for $50.00 plus $3.99 for shipping and handling!

It is very interesting to compare Harryhausen's animation of the fairytales to such SILLY SYMPHONIES as BABES IN THE WOODS and COOKIE CARNIVAL! Ray's HANSEL AND GRETAL is like a 3D stop motion model version of what happens in Disney's BABES IN THE WOODS! And these restored 16mm prints of his short films with vivid Kodachome color are just gorgeous to look at! I wish the bonus material extra explaining the restoring job on the films was better done! A scene comparison of before and after on LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD would have made the explanation more interesting! The hand crafted model sets are amazing and Ray's parents worked on these films too! His mother made great costumes for his beautifully designed model puppet characters and his dad made the armature skeletons inside the figures! It's great to see that Ray could animate charming ""human"" characters too and not just monsters!

His animation of the MEDUSA in his CLASH OF THE TITANS is great but Harry Hamlin's Perseous is so dull and stiff! I say Ray's animated prince in his RAPUNZAL fairy tale is much more expressive and emotionally involving! The body language on the figures combined with the replacement heads with differant expressions is just wonderful!! Love Ray's use of cross dissolves from one expression to another! The characters look like they are thinking! Which is an acheivement Disney animaters accomplished in their classic cartoons! One can wish Ray made MORE of these delightful shorts but at least he finished THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE in 2002 50 years after he started it! If I had bought EARLY YEARS in 2005 i would have gotten it for $29.99!! 2005 was when KING KONG was released onto DVD with Ray's audio commentary on it!

Now it's 8 years later in 2013 and Ray died at age 92! And my mom died at age 91 last year and Ray Bradbury died last year,2012! Where does all the time go?!! I like the addition of dramatic music to the silent film footage of Ray's EVOLUTION! It's quite a compliment to Walt Disney when Ray said that he gave up doing his dinosaur film because he was so impressed with the RITE OF SPRING segment of FANTASIA! Watching the remastered RITE OF SPRING with a brighter, lighter image I can see why! I know there is a HARRYHAUSEN SHORTS vol 1 available on Amazon.com for $29.99 but besides there being no extras I think people are reluctant to try it because the cover 2D illustration is such a poorly drawn cartoon version of the characters! They don't look like them at all! Maybe Sparkhill, the company that made this DVD will put out more copies of EARLY YEARS at a lower price since Ray is now gone. R.I.P. Ray Harryhausen! Update: I just saw that this DVD set is now available from a seller here for $44.00! Man, if I had waited longer! Oh well, I'm happy with my EARLY YEARS copy anyway and mine is in great shape! But this seller is saying his DVD copies have no scratches and cost just $40.00 plus shipping and handling! Oh well!",1374192000,3,4030,4.56984785615491
8046324,5,B00079RC00,"As soon as I learned of Ray's passing I wanted to find as much information about his work as possible and was lucky to come across this very hard to find DVD of his early work with fables and fairy tales. He personally introduces each short film with details of his craft and how he achieved his goals. This is a treasure for sure and I highly recommend it to anyone that love animation, stop motion and the history of the film special effects.",1372636800,,444,4.2976190476190474
8046325,4,B00079RC00,A great collection of the early works of one of the masters in stop motion animation. I remember seeing Red Riding Hood as a 7 yr old in the late 50's and it is a joy to see it again. Lots and lots of supplemental material to enjoy. Harryhausen is a legend. The audio and video quality is decent too.,1358035200,,300,4.016666666666667
