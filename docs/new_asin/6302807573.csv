516152,5,6302807573,"Narcissistic Joan Crawford in an overlooked role runs a circus that can only be described as psychopathically appealing. You see, so many of her employees end up dead! Director, Jim O'Connolly shows great flair for the genre. It's all just a matter of who gets killed next. British veteran Michael Gough, British cutie Judy Geeson in her film debut and the handsome and heroic Ty Hardin are all on hand. It's a great film for Halloween season. Joan Crawford seems to have always had problems managing her business concerns ever since ""Mildred Pierce."" ""Berserk!"" is aptly titled!",972432000,7,579,4.979381443298969

Granted, the film isn't up to the star's previous excursions  into the macabre(""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"",  ""Strait-Jacket"", and ""I Saw What You Did""), but  Crawford's professional handling of the undeniably campy material, and a  few genuine jolts make it an enjoyable thriller. At any rate, this is  better than Crawford's next sci-fi/horror outing, ""Trog!"". The  great supporting cast includes Ty Hardin, Michael Gough, Diana Dors and  Judy Geeson, the latter of ""To Sir, With Love"" fame.",968803200,,661,5.278846153846154

I like Berserk, which I believe was also called ""Circus of Horrors"" because it is another low budget masterpiece.  The bearded lady, the midget, the strong man, and everyone else were all  great. Joan was great in Mildred Pierce, Rain, and Flamingo Road, but this  side of Joan you must see.  The ending will surpise you, when I saw Berserk  the first time I thought Joan was the murderer.  After seeing this movie go  out there and buy or rent Baby Jane, Strait Jacket, I saw what you did, and  Trog.

516181,3,6302807573,"In my head, I always want to mash up the far-superior CIRCUS OF HORRORS (1960) with Joan Crawford's lesser BERSERK (1967) to create one-fantabulous, sanguine '60s horror motion picture. (Both films used Billy Smart's Circus, by the way)... As it is, the only thing BERSERK has going for it is Crawford herself (which is a lot), a better music score, and a terrific elephant sequence. (Oh, and I love cutie Judy Geeson squealling ""Kill, kill, kill  -- that's all I feel inside!"" while packing a butcher knife).

Sadly, BERSERK otherwise doesn't hold up, other than its mid-'60s in-your-face vibe and Halloweenish color scheme...

516188,3,6302807573,"""Berserk"" is another movie about violent deaths in a circus that is certainly no better than any other film of it's type, it's probably not better than ""Circus of Horrors"" from the same era, which had a far more sensational plot than this does. ""Berserk"" sees star Joan Crawford playing circus owner Monica Rivers, whose travelling show is suddenly beset by violent accidents. Bodies pile up until the killer is finally unmasked.

You won't really care about this slender story, what people no doubt come here for is Joan Crawford's performance. She doesn't disappoint, and even though the film is low budget and low on thrills, Joan is always able to hold your attention. What does grate, though, is that in EVERY medium or close shot of the ageing star, a black shadow is deliberately placed between her and the lighting to cover her (presumably) unflattering chin and neck. It looks like artful ""mood lighting"" the first time they do it, but after it's repeated over and OVER again, it becomes a game to count how many scenes Joan acts with the same horizontal dark shadow cutting her head off.

The violent deaths in the movie are not particularly graphic, and there is never much of a build up to them, although I suppose in 1967 audiences might have found it exciting. What I found harder to withstand were the extended sequences of the regular circus acts, which include lion taming, performing elephants, performing horses and ""intelligent poodles"". All of which do nothing for the plot but fill out the running time substantially. As does a truly hideous ""singing performance' by some of the circus performers to their own colleagues, with a little ditty called ""It Could Be You"". Most of the acting is forgettable, and you won't really care who is responsible for the murders, but prepare for a laugh when you do find out, as the revelation is extremely implausible.

So to sum up, Joan does her best, but she's got little to work with here and the film is a dud",1416787200,,1972,4.726744186046512

516212,4,6302807573,"HURRY. HURRY. HURRY.  See a visibly aging La Crawford get all the men's motors running.  Crawford plays the owner of a traveling circus where the acts are being murdered by a mysterious assailant.  Whether the identity of the killer will be a surprise to anyone is not the real focus of this film.  The true entertainment is watching our Joan playing the men like fiddles.  But she is due for a comuppence.  The latest high-wire stud (who is decades younger) makes a big play for the former flapper and she eventually falls for him.  She decides to marry him and makes the incredibly STUPID decision of signing over to him a large part of her holdings.  Once they marry what does one think would happen?  Naturally he would figure a way to do away with her and end up with everything.  What about her teenage daughter?  For a man-eater she hasn't learned the principle rule of man-eaters; give the men only a little, leave them wanting more and then never give it to them.  Aside from the tawdry soap opera the film is entertaining and the quality of the DVD-R release is excellent.  Highly recommended.

Didn't care for the love triangle between Joan and the trapeze artist since it didn't feel too believable.  I mean not because she was a tad older than him but it just seemed awkward.  Joan always seems to put in a 110% effort with all her films even if they aren't award worthy so Beserk is no different.  The circus performances if nothing else are worth the viewing.  It contained a harsh word here or there but nothing shocking and the violence was fairly mild, well fairly mild, compared to today's standard.",1391644800,,650,4.699115044247788
516216,5,6302807573,"Berserk! (1967) is a British horror camp classic that stars Joan Crawford, Ty Hardin, Judy Geeson, and Michael Gough.  This movie is about a traveling circus where murders are mysteriously taking place.  This movie is very similar to Circus Of Horrors (1960), except the budget is lower.  Just as in Circus Of Horrors, youll see a lot of circus acts being performed, a lot of circus animals, circus performers being killed off, and some blood.  Not to mention a dose of camp.  This is a B movie, but Joan Crawford gives 100% effort and gives no less than high quality A movie acting.  Hammer Horror alum Michael Gough (Alfred in the Batman movies from 1989-1997) is also in this movie.  Ive read a lot of reviews from various sources where reviewers are saying negative things about Crawford, everything from her being cast in this movie to begin with, to her being cast as a ringmistress, to her wearing leotards at her age in this movie.  But thats the typical mentality of people, especially when it comes to Americans  a person is too old to do this, too old to do that, they should hang it up once they reach a certain age, they should retire, etc.  The public just wants to snuff a person out, and a lot of it stems from jealousy and their own insecurities.  Crawford was in her early 60s when this movie was made and she looked great for her age.  I think her ringmistress wardrobe looked good and was appropriate for her character.  There is no age limit for a ringmistress.  I remember from my own experience seeing a ringmistress at Circus Circus in Las Vegas in the late 1990s who looked like she was at least in her 50s.  But people rip on Crawford for this movie.  Thats like saying that Cesar Romero was too old to play The Joker on the 1960s Batman TV series (1966-1968).  Romero was 58-61 years old and did an outstanding job and had the energy level of a guy in his 20s or 30s.  Independent thinkers and people who think outside the box are wiser and get more out of life than all the people out there who just follow the herd and play it safe and are so concerned with what people think.  Ive always admired people who do youthful things at an older age.  I think its great.  One thing that many people who don't like Crawfords casting in this movie don't know is that Crawford had been in a couple of carnival/circus movies earlier in her career  The Unknown (1927), and Flamingo Road (1949).  These movies on her resume had to have appealed to the director and certainly allowed her to bring something to the table that the director liked.

Anyway, I highly recommend this movie.  I give this movie 4  stars (rounded up to 5) because I find it entertaining and visually appealing.",1391126400,6,2700,4.470347648261758
516217,3,6302807573,"As a circus picture, Joan Crawford's penultimate film BERSERK is really good. There's lots of great footage of Billy Smart's Circus mixed in with shots of Crawford as ringmaster. The poodle act, the elephants and horses, even a scene with a lion tamer are all classic old school circus routines that recall an earlier time when life and circuses were far less complicated. Although it's not fashionable these days to like circuses because of animal rights issues, I have fond memories of going to see the smaller ones where the animals and the performers not the glam and glitter were the stars. As a horror film, BERSERK leaves a lot to be desired. Aside from a spike through the head there is no gore in the film even though a couple of the deaths are gruesome in conception. There is little suspense leading up to the murders which must be laid at the feet of Jim O'Connolly who directs the film in a very lackluster manner. Even the ever dependable cameraman Desmond Dickinson is less inspired than usual. The script is no great shakes either so why does BERSERK work? In a word, performances.

Joan Crawford was always the total professional and she is every bit that here. Looking great at 62 especially in her ringmaster's outfit, she dominates her scenes as Monica Rivers head of the Rivers Circus. This must have been an interesting experience for Crawford who credited the 1927 circus picture THE UNKNOWN with Lon Chaney Sr as the start of her career. But it's not just a one woman show. Producer Herman Cohen surrounded her with quality Brit performers like Michael Gough and Robert Hardy who complement Joan but never overshadow her. Add real performers from the Billy Smart Circus and you have a movie that is more fun than it has any right to be. The real surprise here is male lead Ty Hardin best known for a 1960s Western TV series BRONCO. He makes the most of an unsympathetic part with a performance that has confidence and authority. Judy Geeson, fresh from TO SIR WITH LOVE, has little to do as Joan's daughter until the end. BERSERK is not a particularly good movie but it is entertaining and is light years ahead of Joan's final film TROG which came 3 years later.",1388275200,3,2186,4.634020618556701

Hey.  It was an Oscar.

Fast forward and you find Joan Crawford as Monica Rivers, a blowsy old wreck of a woman who still wants sex from Grade-C attractive men.  And she gets it.  And she's running a circus.

And the film is terrible.

This ""Berserk"" film is a horrible example of what can befall great stars when they don't care about anything but the paycheck.  Crawford's worst?  It would've been, but dammit, she won that prize for ""Trog"" two years later.

For a woman who slammed away at society about what to put where and how to dress and how many candles and two of the same colored vegetables on a plate is unappetizing; for a woman who was dressed by Gilbert Adrian and Jean Louis and Orry-Kelly and oh so many more, who worked with Gable and Tracy and Barrymore......oh god gawd Joan, but sometimes your taste was in the gutter.  This film is a prime example, you fool.",1368144000,3,946,4.473684210526316
516243,5,6302807573,"THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.

I first saw this movie several months ago, and took an instant liking to it. Joan Crawford stars as Monica Rivers, a woman who owns and runs a traveling circus. But her circus is plagued with occasional mysterious murders. First, her world famous high wire performer dies after his rope snaps and is coiled around his neck, and he's dangling in front of a horrified audience. Shortly later on, another guy comes on board and becomes the next high wire performer, the Magnificent Hawkins (played by Ty Hardin), and he and Monica have a behind the scenes affair.

Then, moments later, her assistant gets murdered, and the performers gather around to find out what happened. Monica then requests for her performers to go back to bed. But, they don't go to bed; they gather for a private meeting and disagree on who they think the murderer is. Enter Matilda (who is a bitch, but a likeable one, and is my favorite character), a smart mouthed blonde who feels that Monica is behind the whole thing (and tries to convince her co-workers of that, but to no avail). After she says for the second time that ""it's the boss"", Monica shouts out, ""You're right!"" After reprimanding Matilda about her negative attitude, she tells everyone to return to their caravans and get some rest for the next day's matinee. She gives Lazlo, Matilda's lover, the benefit of the doubt, but tells him to keep Matilda under control, or else they will both be forced to leave.

After a while, we see Monica's daughter, Angela, with the head of her school, who tells Monica that Angela has been expelled for inappropriate behavior. Monica is disappointed about Angela's eviction from school; Angela begs to stay on because she says that the ""circus is in her blood"". Monica agrees to let Angela stay on, but that she must become a hard worker. Angela joyfully agrees. Then, Angela greets her circus friends, and even gets told by Matilda that her mother might be the killer (but not in those exact words, of course).

Monica then goes back to her caravan, but sees a shadow of someone following her. The person following her is that of Bruno, the short guy, who wants to talk to her about something. Agitated, she tells him to go back to sleep. After several moments, we then see Matilda about to go on for her act, but Monica told her that she left instructions to report to her caravan, but Matilda said she was busy. Then Matilda goes on for her act (woman being sawed in half), but the act goes awry.

Then, Monica throws a celebration for the performers to help them take their minds off the dilemmas that they've suffered. Angela is not having a good time, and whines to her mother that she was being raised by teachers and other people away from the circus, and abruptly leaves. Next, she is due for her act, being spun on a wheel with knives being thrown towards her.

After that, The Magnificent Hawkins, performs his high wire act as before, but this time with a special bicycle and then tries balancing on a chair on the wire, being careful of the sharp pointed steel bayonets some sixty plus feet below on the floor. Then, an unseen gloved hand throws a knife at Hawkins' back, causing him to lose his balance and fall to his death on the bayonetted floor, with a horrified audience.

For those of you who have not yet seen this film, I will not reveal who the killer was. This movie is highly enjoyable; I feel that this is a comedy, even though it is supposed to be a drama. Worth watching. Since this is manufactured on demand, there are no extras on this DVD, and not even a main menu, beware of this. Grade: A++",1362873600,7,3632,4.552833078101072

516262,4,6302807573,"Circus movies with Horror elements have always graced the screens since the early silents but never were there more variations till the late fifties and early sixties especially from Great Britain. Producer/Director Irwin Allen re-introduced the murderer under the big top genre with 'THE BIG CIRCUS'-1958 which included a bunch of big name actors from all genres being part of the usual suspects as the main killer is revealed.  Director Sydney Hayer's 'CIRCUS OF HORRORS'-1959 and Director John Moxey's 'CIRCUS OF FEAR aka PSYCHO CIRCUS'- 1966 led the way in Britain and finally Producer Herman Cohen got into the act(no pun intended) with 'BERSERK'-1967, a brisk, enjoyable romp with famous Joan Crawford as the lead and joined by the most familiar British character actors at that time.  You have Cohen stalwart Michael Gough who starred in at least 4 of his productions, Diana Dors who still looks pretty good here, teen sensation Judy Geeson and huge Milton Reid to name but a few.  Cohen would use Crawford again in the abysmal 'TROG' 1970.  Direction is by Jim O'Connolly who would go on to lens Special Effects master Ray Harryhausen's 'THE VALLEY OF GWANGI'- 1968 and work for Producer Richard Gordon on the underrated  'TOWER OF EVIL'-1972.  Enough said about the plot, just enjoy the circus acts and grisly (for their time) murders as Columbia releases it in a beautiful DVD-R with bright colors and great sound.

I own this DVD and it is beautifully remastered and Crawford looks amazing at roughly 62. The film's authentic circus atmosphere is well done, and while the characters are all pretty believable, the plot certainly isn't! But that is what makes it entertaining and gives it that cool low-budget 1960's horror film feel. I was impressed that although not in a film up to her standards of years earlier, Joan Crawford gives it her all, and yet is the LEAST over the top of the entire cast. I read that she used her own wardrobe for most of this, to help save on costs.

Joan Crawford wanted to WORK. That was her life and all she had ever known. The 1960's, especially the late 60's, was (much like today!) very youth oriented. The lady took what she could get, given those circumstances, and she made the best of it. That is to be admired.",1316649600,28,1018,4.380952380952381

516265,3,6302807573,"It's next to impossible to view BERSERK today from the same perspective as it was viewed when it first opened in early 1968. Viewed today, in retrospect, the camp element fully realized, it is truly a hilariously bad film. YET...there is something oddly compelling about it.

The one and only Joan Crawford, in her sixties and in the sad twilight of her career, stars as Monica Rivers, the owner of a struggling British circus. As we see in the opening, she is also ringmistress, and appears in scene after scene in a black leotard and fishnet stockings. I kid thee not.

The high wire artist dies in an implausible-doesn't-describe-it mishap during the opening credits (in fact, the title card of the film appears in the wake of his swinging body. WEEEEEEEE!!!!). Watch during the opening credits as Joan beats the crap out of a cameraman who tried to get a snapshot of the body as it is being removed.

Cut to Joan's trailer (I'm sorry, CARAVAN. You will hear this word at least 30 times during the film). This is where BERSERK takes shape. Monica excitedly sees the murder as potentially boosting box office. Her business partner, Durando, is a bit creeped out at her giddiness, at which point she offers to let him tuck her in. Yikes. At this point you should already know what you're in for.

As the film progresses the murders begin to pile up, and we are introduced to a troupe of interesting circus folk (and potential suspects). Actually, only Diana Dors as Matilda is really interesting, but the others are supposed to capture our fancy as well. Anyway, a new high wire man named Frank Hawkins (Ty Hardin. He's not really interesting either, but he is integral to the plot) arrives; Joan/Monica hires him and soon Joan/Monica is sleeping with him, which gives us the priceless Joan-in-negligee-by-candlelight scene (Frank: ""I'm crazy 'bout you, Monica"", Monica: ""I'm fond of you, Frank"".) The only acknowledgement of the 25-30 years separating them is a brief throwaway comment late in the film. But I digress.

The dialogue alternates between bad and REALLY bad. The one scene that is actually, legitimately not terrible is a brief encounter between Frank and Matilda in his caravan. The movie crackles for a brief moment. But it reverts back to the inane. An inspector from Scotland Yard shows up, steps in animal dung, interrogates the circus folk, and gets a lesson in circus life from Joan/Monica (""We've eaten caviar, and we've eaten sawdust"").

Mind you, sandwiched between all of this are MULTIPLE circus acts that do little but stall for time. I suppose the poodles are cute and it is kinda cool to watch elephants carefully step over women. But I was anxious to get back to the lousy movie that was on pause.

Through it all stands Joan Crawford, her hair piled in a bizarre bouffant ring, her face painted and pulled back, her neck hidden in every possible shadow the lighting person could concoct. She is this crazy unstoppable force, barking orders and shouting insults at full-throttle (Joan/Monica to Matilda: ""You slut! You miserable ingrate!"", Matilda: ""You don't frighten me. I still say..."", Joan/Monica: ""CUT YOUR TONGUE OUT FIRST!!!!!""). For better or worse, she keeps things moving when everything around her is falling flat. And she keeps it going right up to the climax, which reveals a killer who, not only has a questionable motive, but whose very ability to even commit the murders is next to impossible. By then the suspension of belief being asked of the audience won't be a big deal. You gave up questioning logistics over an hour earlier.

All said...I love this movie. It's a groovy trainwreck, campy and quotable, with a great performance by Dors and the spectacle of Joan Crawford in a (as an IMDB reviewer called it) ""damn the torpedoes performance"". Love her or hate her...just try to look away.",1315785600,10,3841,4.835616438356165

""Berserk"" is the best of these films, not because it is well-written or well-acted but because it is so bad it's good. Crawford, looking like a sexpot gone bad, plays the Circus Owner a la Mommie Dearest, spewing invective at the Business Partner and some of the performers. In the opening scene, she slugs a reporter and shoves people around while Gaspar the Great is ""hanging around"" the tightrope. The special effects are awful as this is a low budget film.

516268,5,6302807573,"By the late 1960's Joan Crawford's career in Hollywood had pretty much dried up. Except with the occasional television guest-star part on episodic television, Joan found work on the big screen in England as Hollywood producers became leary of Joan because of her battle with alcohol and her age. Tinsletown, foolishly, put her out to pasture with over 40 years as a leading actress. Herman Cohen, a British horror movie producer, cast Joan in ""Berserk!"" (1968) and her last film ""Trog"" (1970).

 ""Berserk!"" may be many watts away from her better-known films like ""Mildred Pierce"", ""Grand Hotel"", and even ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"", but Joan gives the less-than-steller script her all. At age 64 Crawford looks breathtaking and her body amazing, dressed as a circus ring leader. The plot is pretty lame as she plays Monica Rivers who owns a travelling circus with each one of her employees ending up dead.

 ""Berserk!"" may not have been a financial hit here in North America, but surprisingly it became a hit in other countries which may explain why the movie received a DVD release in Spain a few years ago and never saw a release in the U.S. and Canada. The VHS edition of the film goes for a lot of money as it has become a collector's item for the ultimate Crawford fan.

 When asked years later by a biographer about ""Berserk!"" Joan stated, ""Please don't ask me about any films that followed ""Baby Jane?""; they were all terrible, even the few I thought might be good. I did them because I needed the money or because I was bored or both. I hope they have been withdrawn and are never heard from again!"".",1293408000,2,1616,4.652631578947369
516269,4,6302807573,"Joan Crawford, in the next to last theatrical movie she did, shows why she was The Queen of Hollywood. It is very entertaining to see the then 68 year old Crawford take command of the screen with a script that is less than stellar and a cast of actors to match.

There are echos of the Crawford we came to know from the Warner Bros. years with some of the sassy lines Crawford gets to throw out and plenty to hold the attention of the viewer with Crawford strutting around in the ring mistress uniform she wears.

For pure kitsch and a laugh or two I say pick this movie up and get a taste of Crawford carrying a whole movie, bad as it is, and watch how a true actress makes it hang and hold your attention.",1261526400,4,707,4.115942028985507
516270,3,6302807573,"""Berserk!"" is perhaps one of Joan's worst films of the 60's and the very worst suspense/horror film she ever made. The story is so over-the-top. Joan plays Monica Rivers, a lady ringmaster who decides to milk the publicity from a string of strange murders. The movie is still not totally worthless. Joan always gave a great performance no matter how ludicrous the script was and this is certainly no exception. This movie totally reminds me of another one of Joan's cult-classics,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Johnny-Guitar/dp/6303391931/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Johnny Guitar</a>. Not just because it's incredibly dreadful and incredibly ridiculous, but also because there seems to be so much hostility and tension among the cast of characters in this picture. I also love the outfits that Joan wears (especially that black leotard.) And I sorta enjoyed the performances by Ty Hardin and Judy Geeson because they fall into that ""so bad it's good"" category.

516272,5,6302807573,"""There's nothing certain in show business,"" Joan Crawford tells us in the aptly titled 1967 gem Berserk. ""We've eaten caviar, and we've eaten sawdust."" Connoisseurs of Bad Big-Top Movies We Love like Big Circus, Carnival Story and The Greatest Show on Earth can be certain of one thing, though: Berserk--which features Crawford looking even more butch and self-enchanted than usual--offers up the tastiest mouthful of sawdust to be found anywhere in this demented genre.

When 59-year-old circus ringmaster Crawford (a terrifying vision in her trim tuxedo jacket and fishnet stockings) introduces her world-famous high-wire soloist, the audience is definitely not ready for what happens next: the high wire snaps and coils around the performer's neck, leaving him dangling above their upturned faces. Oblivious to the human tragedy, a post-show Crawford busies herself with the night box-office receipts. ""How can you be so cold-blooded?"" asks her business partner. ""We're running a circus, not a charm school,"" Crawford growls, going on to point out that the violent death will be good for business. Then she changes tack. ""What can I do to cheer you up?"" she queries. ""I just may let you tuck me in tonight."" God forbid! Even with Vaseline smeared on the lens and strategic shadows cast across her face, our star looks, at best, like a short, male senior citizen in elaborate drag.

The next day, who should turn up but a high-wire soloist in need of a job. The suspiciously useful newcomer is strapping studmuffin Ty Hardin, who is soon embroiled in a torrid affair with Crawford, despite the fact that he's 22 years her junior. The biggest scare in this whole movie is the appearance of a postcoital Crawford, done up in a negligee and a big-hair wig. ""Long ago I lost the capacity to love,"" she purrs, very believably indeed. ""If you want me to spell it out for you, I will. What we have is no more than a greeting card. Maybe not as friendly."" Just as you're thinking that's not exactly what you'd say if you looked like an aging female impersonator and had somehow gotten Ty Hardin into bed, Hardin replies, ""You're playing a dangerous game!""

When Crawford's business partner is murdered, the circus performers get agitated. The magician--obviously the thinker in the group--announces, ""It is clear to me there is a killer loose."" Enter blowsy, badly bleached blonde tootsie Diana Dors (who was at one time hailed as England's answer to Marilyn Monroe--i.e., Jayne Mansfield with bad teeth). As the magician's new paramour/assistant, Dors expresses her view that bosswoman Crawford is the killer. Overhearing this, Crawford snaps, ""You slut!"" Whereupon Dors demonstrates the accuracy of this assessment by boozily coming on to Hardin. You may want to memorize Hardin's reply for your own future use: ""You're peddling your merchandise at the wrong booth."" When Hardin tosses Dors out on her rear--literally--a high-water mark in cinema cattiness is reached as an onlooking circus babe croaks, ""You must be more careful, you'll damage your brain!"" Happily, a nail-scratching, wig-pulling catfight ensues.

Enter Crawford's unhappy teen daughter (Judy Geeson) who's just been expelled from charm school. ""Let me stay here with you,"" she pleads to her mom. ""The circus is in my blood like it's in yours."" Speaking of blood, the next big-top demise occurs when the magician saws Dors in two for real. Now even Crawford is afraid. ""I've got the jitters!"" she confesses to Hardin. ""I'm not made of stone!"" Actually, wax is what we were thinking.

Doing what anyone whose circus is being torn asunder by a psychopath would do, Crawford throws a gigantic party, at which she confesses to Hardin that she's made him her partner: ""You'll have 25 percent of the circus and 100 percent of me."" When charm school dropout Geeson appears to be sulking her way through the shindig, Crawford wonders out loud if the girl is spoiled. ""You certainly never lacked anything,"" she points out. ""No, except what I needed most...you!"" the teen shrieks, bolting into the night. ""I have an eerie feeling the killer will strike again at any moment,"" Crawford murmurs. Hmmm. Is this just a doting mom's wishful thinking? We don't want to spoil the ending for you, but suffice it to say that Berserk parallels its star's real life in some amusing ways. The on-screen Crawford often had her hands full with pesky teen daughters--think Mildred Pierce, Strait-Jacket, Della--but for cinematic subtext on the offscreen Crawford's doubts about her adopted daughter Christina, Berserk is unsurpassed.",1186099200,34,4571,5.07313829787234

516274,4,6302807573,"Another clinker from the Joan Crawford Horror Collection. This film is interesting for many reasons. First its a camp classic that can guarantee laughs no matter how many times its viewed. The interesting parts for me are the similarities this movie has w/ some other Joan Crawford movies & w/ her own life. The mother/daughter/older female/younger female conflicts (Mildred Pierce, Straight-Jacket, Queen Bee, etc.) Her insistance at having love interests that are half her age (which i think is kinda cool since you rarely see this in films today except now its the old guy/young gal thing). & lastly the fact that no matter how awful her films got, she always seemed to be giving a relatively good performance despite how badly inexperienced the other actors in her films are. She's always so much more beleivable than everyone else. & for a woman who was in her 60's she had some pretty nice legs & didn't look bad as a red-head either. The scenes between her & Ty Hardin as lovers bordered on the ridiculous & is one of the reasons this film is so funny. But again, she's beleivable, he isn't. The circus animal acts were a bit long & couldve been edited to a few seconds rather than the pointless 5 minutes they are at in this film. The ending here & in ""Straight-Jacket"" are identical. Theres even a part in the begining of the film while the credits are rolling where she is punching & pushing people back from the body, there is no sound but she is screaming for people to get away & she looks truly annoyed. It seemed so spontaneous that I wondered was this an bitchy off-guarded moment they caught on camera or Joan just being a beleivable performer again.",1038528000,5,1667,4.616161616161616
516275,3,6302807573,"I suppose it is terribly embarrassing, that one of the great icons of Hollywood's golden age finished up her career with a series of increasingly junky little movies--but Joan Crawford, like her arch-rival Bette Davis, simply didn't know when to leave her career well enough alone.  And so now we are blessed with this ultra-lightweight script that has the seriously aging actress as a circus owner, trotting around the big top in fishnets and heels, snapping her whip, and worrying about how a strangely rising body count may affect her business--not mention her boy-toy.

Now, it should be very obvious at this point that NO ONE is going to take this film seriously.  And once you stop trying to take it seriously, it actually turns into one of those ""tacky fun"" films where you keep watching because you simply can't believe they had the nerve.  But hey--Crawford had paid her dues, and if she wanted to go there, who are we to argue--especially with such a ""guilty pleasure"" movie at hand?

I remember thinking that Joan Crawford had really lowered herself by acting in such cheap junk--as a circus owner, yet! What happened to the glorious Crawford films, where she was dressed to the nines in silk, furs, and diamonds? In ""Berserk,"" she wears fishnet stockings and cracks a whip! Maybe that's somebody's idea of a fantasy, but when the woman doing the cracking is 65+ years of age and boozed-up, I have to draw the line.

There are so many great highlights: every time Joan's in a scene, her face is lighted, but her neck is in darkness. This happens in every freakin' scene! Even when everyone's out in the sun! And when she starts seducing Ty Hardin, who is young enough to be her son, well, the film tips over into the truly ludicrous. And what is it with all the cheesy circus acts? Gawd, where's the horror? Oh, yeah, almost forgot to mention the midget and the blowsy girl who gets sawed in half. That's horror enough...wait! One more thing: Michael Gough getting a spike through the head!
