8635994,5,B00HUQC4I8,"I was at the austin film festival the year it played with my own film ""Liars Fires and  Bears""
and this movie made me laugh my ass off with the absolutely accurate jokes about the
festival process and filmmaking and the people you meet while on the journey of making
movies.
I laughed a lot watching this and its a lot of fun and when it comes I will buy it.
I just wished these guys saw my movie... lol",1392163200,4,403,4.0375
