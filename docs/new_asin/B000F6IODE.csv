2553112,4,B000F6IODE,"When this movie first came out I thought it was going to be horrible. But when I actually watched it, I was very entertained even though it was somewhat predictable. What makes this movie different is they mixed a boxing movie with the ""pledging"" aspects of a movie like full metal jacket. This concept was different and actually refreshing. The actors did a good job in training for the boxing scenes and did a good job acting overall. Even Tyrese did a good job in the movie and I don't consider him a good actor at all. Overall this is a good movie to rent and enjoy for a weekend.",1151452800,2,584,4.318181818181818
2553113,1,B000F6IODE,"Horrible movie.  The script is stupid, music sucks, the acting is bad and the lines don't make much sense.  Franco's character has an antisocial attitude for no apparent reason.  For someone who as wanted to be a Naval Officer all his life, why would he not be a team player?  He can't accept help from men but has no problem getting help from women?  Gaining weight eating junk food and candy just ridiculous when he could easily eat more protein and carbs.  The only thing good about this movie are the realistic boxing sequences.  I would suggest watching the original ""Officer and a Gentlemen"" this fake updated version is the worst.  Don't waist your time or money.",1151366400,4,670,4.666666666666667

2553115,4,B000F6IODE,"Younger fans of Hollywood films will no doubt give this movie the thumbs up.  But for those Hollywood film fans old enough to remember the 1982 film ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" starring Richard Gere, ""Annapolis"" is a poor imitation. ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" told the melodramatic story of Zack Mayo, played by Richard Gere,  whose self-absorption came into harsh conflict with the communitarian values of his drill instructor Emil Foley played by Lou Gossett Jr . The extra-curricular affair between Zack and a local girl served to illuminate his self-interested attitude in which the interests of others were held in little regard.  Only after Mayo's best friend Sid Worley commited suicide over an unhappy romance did Zack come out of his culturally-programmed adolescence and then mature into adulthood.

That said, younger audiences will like the melodramatic plot of ""Annapolis"".  James Franco plays Jake Huard, an amateur boxer and shipyard worker who wants to climb the class ladder to become a midshipman.  And this is where Jake Huard parts company with his predecessor Zack Mayo.  Zack Mayo was always officer material, just pre-absorbed with getting ahead and not taking notice that others were trying to get ahead also.  Jake Huard, however, is in search of his estranged father's approval and determines to suffer whatever it takes to become an officer.  Whereas Mayo matured into an officer, Huard remains a self-absorbed boxer in a Navy uniform - although less self-absorbed because he is able to get the monkey off his back and win his father's approval.

In a style reminiscent of ""Boom Boom"" Mancini, Huard battered his Congressperson with requests for over 30 days straight in order to secure a letter of recommendation to Annapolis.  Once there, he bunks with the loser Estrada played by Wilmer Calderon, the methodical Loo played by Roger Fan, and the misfit Twins masterfully played by Vicellous Reon Shannon.  Twins and Huard are scorned and ridiculed by the other cadets who view them as misfits.  The resulting chemistry between these two characters is superb, reinforced by Shannon's excellent acting in his portrayal of Twins. Huard continues to break rules and grate nerves until his opportunity for redemption arrives - a boxing showdown with the cadet menace Cole, played by Tyrese Gibson.  The film quickly transforms itself into Rocky versus the Naval Dictator.  Despite the canned character scripts and sea of clichs complained of by previous reviewers, the melodrama never sinks with the ship.

The so-called romance or lust attraction that develops between Huard and the officer Ali played by Jordana Brewster is pretty far-fetched.  It is true that, in real American life, sometimes -rarely - American teachers fall for students. It happens. But Huard had one previous meeting with Ali in a bar prior to all this, so she had not always been his superior officer.  Younger audiences will find the relationship between Huard and Ali plausible, while older audiences will find it preposterous.

""Annapolis"" is directed by Justin Lin and was filmed at a Philadelphia College rather than the actual Annapolis.  It seems that the Navy does not cotton to disparaging Hollywood films - they said ""No"" to ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" too, which was mostly filmed on location at Port Townsend, Washington rather than the  Naval Aviation Officer Candidate School in Pensacola, Florida.

Rated PG-13 for profanity, lust, alcohol and violence.",1148515200,28,3471,5.171735241502684
2553116,5,B000F6IODE,"A movie that reaches out to you.  It's a movie about inspiration, dedication and most of all, honor.  People calling this movie having a weak script and bad acting or a bad choice of actors really doesn't know a good movie when they see it.  This movie IS NOT racist nor is it bias at all.  It's not racist because Tyrese Gibson is viewed as the strongest person in the movie.",1145232000,5,376,4.253521126760563
2553117,1,B000F6IODE,"Terrible!  Nothing real about it.  The outline follows and parallels an ""Officer and a Gentleman""  but poorly.
  Raised by an unsupportive father after mother's death
  Not really qualified  only determined
  Angry loner who doesn't understand teamwork
  Assaults a superior officer
  Defiant of authority
  Best friend attempts suicide after being dropped from Academy
  Way behind class in Academics
  Causes trouble for class mates
  Publicly fights superior officer who appeared to be the enemy but ultimately makes him an officer.

  Also poor versions of themes from Rocky, North and South, Coach Carter, and other good movies.

Not filmed at Annapolis.  There are no ship yards anywhere near Annapolis   the movie shows the lead character sitting and looking at his home  a shipyard in Philadelphia more than 90 miles from Annapolis as the crow flies.

The main topic of the movie is boxing.  The parts about the Naval Academy are totally unrealistic and unimportant to the movie.

The boxing scenes looked like 3D animation.  Mostly showing closeups of fast and furious punching.  The lead character gains 35 lbs in a few days by eating junk food while training vigorously so that he can fight his superior officer as a heavyweight.  Get real!!!",1492214400,2,1253,5.1206030150753765

2553126,5,B000F6IODE,"What changes in us after a disastrous life-turning event depends on what follows after. Do we wallow in victimhood, or do we move on, move up, and move out of the pits life has landed us in? Good films with this theme are not hard to find; it is a common story for us all. ""Annapolis"" is the tale of a ship-fitter, Jake Huard (played by James Franco), working for his father's construction crew on the docks across the river from the prestigious Naval academy. Jake's dream is attend Annapolis, but he was wait-listed when he applied. So he fills his days with the hard work of a welder and riveter, and his leisure with training as a boxer.

We first meet Jake as he prepares to go into the ring against co-worker AJ, a taller, heavier boxer. (AJ is portrayed by Jim Parrack, who was a main non-vampire character in the HBO ""True Blood"" series.) Jake refuses to fight as directed by his father, closing with the larger boxer and defeating him despite multiple knock-downs. The naval officer in the crowd of dockworkers, conspicuous in his whites, has come to offer him a place at Annapolis. Lt. Buxton (Donnie Wahlberg) comments on how unusual it is for an application to come from someone in Jake's position. We get another glimpse of Jake's persistence thereby: he had apparently pestered a Senator daily for over a month to help.

""People who live in Arkansas, you know what their favorite state is? Mississippi. Cause Mississippi's the only thing that keeps Arkansas from being the worst state in the whole country.""
  ""I'm Mississippi.""
  ""Well you sure as hell ain't California. Listen, Cole and Whitaker are so busy tryin' to run you out they forgot about me. As a matter of fact, they've forgotten about every other plebe in this whole company.""

For Jake, the ""semicolon"" is not just leaving the comfortable environs of family and friends to join the company where he will be ""boxing over his weight"". It is facing life-crippling bias. Jake grows his life in the direction he chooses by feeding his habit of persistence in the face of prejudice, and staying true to his dreams:  ""Some of you have only known success your entire life. But this year, your plebe year, you will know failure... because failure is a far greater teacher than success.""

And that's the point. Failure is not a stopping place; it can be a launch-pad to success. One only has to survive, and persist.",1479081600,,2385,4.673031026252984

2553137,2,B000F6IODE,"It's a disgrace that our nation's great Naval Academy shares a name with this cinematic cringe-fest.

The only thing stopping me from giving it the lowest possible rating is the surprisingly high quality of the supporting performances, particularly Tyrese Gibson.  He is outstanding as an upright Marine who wants to ensure Annapolis produces the highest caliber of officer.

If only the filmmakers shared his dedication and commitment to excellence.  Alas, instead we have a tired and predictable plot, with one-dimensional characters (the upright Asian, the ladies' man Hispanic, the overachieving black boy from a small town, etc.).  These actors do the best they can with trivial and unimaginative dialogue; James Franco, on the other hand, is surprisingly flat and uninspired as the protagonist.  You don't identify with him; you don't root for him; quite frankly, you see him commit acts that are most unworthy of an officer (or even just a decent human being) and you wind up wanting him to get a well-deserved ejection from Annapolis (while wondering how the heck he was admitted in the first place).

Does he walk the plank?  Of course not.  Instead, two of his roommates do while he makes it through a grueling first year AND (most improbable of all) gets the girl.

This movie also has a lot of boxing -- so much so that you might wonder whether Annapolis is actually a boxing academy.

For all its banality, Annapolis still manages NOT to be family-friendly:  within the first five minutes my kids were asking me ""what's a hooker?""  And later, ""what's porn?""  Very upstanding depiction of a proud naval tradition.  Errrrrr....

Do yourself a favor and give Annapolis a very wide berth.",1465430400,,1697,4.98576512455516

2553180,5,B000F6IODE,"I enjoyed this movie because it is largely about Annapolis and boxing. It's about Jake Huard a tough kid, a 'rivet,' who grew up literally across the river from Annapolis in a ship building town. Who in a promise to his deceased mother aspires to full-fill his life long ambition of attending Annapolis.

Like any movie about a cadet at one of our nations elite military academies this too is about enduring hazing, rigorous academic training on par with an ivy league university and about those who fail to measure up to our academies simple but some times difficult honor code of 'we do not lie, cheat, steal or tolerate those who do.' It even has a love story.

I enjoyed how a large part of this movie centered around boxing at Annapolis. Cadets at Annapolis, at least among the boxers, still talk about the match between James Webb and Oliver North while both were still cadets there before their respective rise to prominence.

The episode of this movie I would like most to comment on is the one in which Jake's roommate and friend 'Arkansas,' attempts to commit suicide because he has failed to complete an obstacle course run by a mere 4 seconds. Jake blames their CO a former enlisted recon marine for riding Arkansas too hard.

I personally disagree with Jake on this issue. The purpose of our national military academies is prepare combat leaders for the awful responsibility of defending and safe guarding our precious democracy. Arkansas although a very nice guy was not born equipped to be a combat leader. Military training is harsh for a reason.

 Medical studies have shown that more than 95% of those who commit suicide had a preexisting mental illness. We must ask ourselves what would have been the fate of Arkansas charges had he been allowed to graduate Annapolis with a mental defect. I am not unsympathetic to the plight of the mentally ill in our society, lord knows I'm not. But what would have been the fate of a company or even a division of marines under Arkansas command on a bloody beach head? What would have been all of our fates if Arkansas were allowed to skipper a nuclear submarine during an international crisis at def-con four such as the Cuban-missile crisis?

All in all this is an excellent movie about Annapolis, about boxing, about leadership.",1419033600,3,2288,4.719298245614035

2553212,2,B000F6IODE,I choose to give this movie two stars.  It is nothing that I expected and does not give much about Annapolis other than a cliche about a superior officer not liking one of the new men.  There is much to show about Annapolis but instead the first years run the same course several times.  A lot of the film is devoted to boxing.  What the heck?  Annapolis is more than training for a big boxing event.  There are interesting and difficult studies at Annapolis and other things they do which are barely touched upon.  What the heck is this main part about boxing about?  It  scarcely reminds me of Annapolis at all .  What is this film about really?  Rocky joins the military?,1396569600,,674,4.3983739837398375

2553232,5,B000F6IODE,"Even thou he was in several things before Annapolis, I consider this to be James Franco's breakthrough role. Just the training and studying alone, must have been as intense as the film itself. Franco plays Jake Huard, a first year student at the Naval academy. The story takes you inside one the hardest and most secretive schools in America, showing you just what it takes to even make it past your first year. The story itself is very inspirational and the acting is top notch. This isn't just a good film, it's one that you know took a lot out of everyone involved. I was entertained, excited, and inspired by an underdog who just wouldn't give up. This is a tremendous film that fell under the radar, because of a then, unknown cast, but it really is a must see for fans of inspirational, military and sports dramas.",1361577600,14,820,4.547297297297297

I really enjoyed this movie. This film has a great story and great acting. It's is an inspiring tale of determination and courage that will touch almost anyone who watches it. It's definitely worth watching.",1350950400,3,422,4.780821917808219
2553240,4,B000F6IODE,"I was given this movie a while ago. Finally got around to watching it, mainly because Gibson is one of my favorite male actors. I have got to say Gibson nails the roll of the no exceptions Marine who won't take any crap and who sticks to the rules even when over something as small as someone being 4 seconds over a run that determined if they stay or are separated from the Navy.

In fact Gibson deserves his own paragraph. His character is truly fantastic and in my opinion is one of those characters who really makes the film. Without his character I'm not sure it would be as good of a film. In the film Cole hints to the fact that he served in combat however never really comes out and says it. Using this as a reason to be a toughest meanest character in the film. Often reminding Huard and the rest of the Company that their mistakes will cost others their lives. Many may consider his character over the top and excessively mean. For example (also referenced above) when Nance couldn't complete the O Course he works all year and at the final test him and the rest who hadn't completed it were told 5min and no retests. Nance's character goes from a guy who couldn't even complete to course to someone who did however his time was 5min 4 seconds, a mere 4 seconds over the time limit and a failure. While Huard (Franco) attempts to talk Cole (Gibson) into overlooking the 4 seconds his pleas are met with deaf ears. That is what sealed Gibson's character for me as a good character while i did like Nance, Cole sticking to the standards and not overlooking it certainly finished off his appearance as no crap Marine and gave me a proud feeling of his character while at the same time a sad feeling for Nance who was walking off alone in clear sadness and shame.

At a running time of 117min i thought the movie could've been a little longer. Also i felt that they should've spent more time focusing on the classes and workouts along with the relationships between the characters. However i suppose most would've considered that a dull movie but i felt that the film focused a little too much on boxing and not enough on the other aspects. But i realize that boxing did indeed add suspense to the story (if Huard would defeat Cole).

They did do a really good job showing the strong attraction between Huard and Ali there were points where i found myself thinking ""Make a move already"" knowing full well that if he had made a move during his 1st year he would've been kicked out. Then at the end feeling relief that he did in fact get the girl.

Overall this is a decent film, yes they focused a little too much on the boxing, yes it could've been a little bit longer, yes they could've developed the relationships among the class better, and yes i felt it was lacking much of what one would assume this film would be about..the training and classes and transition for them from civilians to Officers in the U.S. Navy. So i give it 4/5 stars it does have its clear and present flaws but what earned the film 4 and not 3 stars was Gibson's portrayal of a Marine who demands the best and the relationship between Huard and Ali and how they were able to really make me feel the attraction. Along with how the film made me feel for both sides, to understand why Cole did what he did and at the same time feel bad for Nance who failed.

Its a good film, not a great film but its good. I will say it again they could've went with a little less boxing.",1349049600,2,3452,4.320987654320987
2553241,5,B000F6IODE,"This movie had all the right stuff I'd ever expect to see in a highly satisfying movie. Jake Huard was a guy I could've really cared about as a person and I would've done anything for him as a friend. His character - all the characters - were very credible and the storyline couldn't have been stronger. If you're a son or a dad, a member of the military or romantic, you'll easily identify with several of the characters in this high quality production.",1346976000,4,454,4.416666666666667

2553243,4,B000F6IODE,"The unlikely story line of this film is that a young man (Franco) whose mother always wanted him to go to the US Naval Academy and his father who works in a ship yard who doesn't think he has a prayer for success at the Academy gets his chance when other students opt to go elsewhere to school.  We learn later that he is recruited largely for his boxing ability...or so it seems.

When he arrives he is assigned to a dorm room with three other cadets, and they, of course, each have their own unique personalities and even racial backgrounds.  Students are shown dealing with academic challenges, issues regarding personal honor, Academy traditions, and boxing.

Franco clashes with his cadet commander, and he seeks a chance to face him in the boxing ring during an annual Academy event called ""The Brigades.""

The bottom line is that this loner needs to come to grips with the fact that he can't succeed at the Academy without help.

All in all this is a largely unbelievable, but fun action film set in Annapolis.

Even though Annapolis is an excellent movie, some people on here feel the need to compare it to ""An Officer and a Gentleman."" I even own that movie too, but the movie was made more than 25 years ago and I don't know why they want to bash ""Annapolis"" with the comparison of that movie. Both movies aren't even close to have to be compared. James Franco stars a local shipbuilder who manages to get into the Naval Academy because some other candidates felt the need to go out partying instead. To become a Naval officer takes 4 years and it shows the first grueling year that Franco goes through, while in the movie ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", the training clearly took 12 to 13 weeks in order to be a Naval aviator. Annapolis was brilliant in all their scenes, especially the big boxing scene, and people need to stop comparing this to a movie classic that was made a long time ago. I loved this movie from the start, and it makes me think that they should make another movie too, this time about West Point, because no one ever made a movie about that.

Now, uncertain if a regular kid from a poor blue collar family can fit into the Academy's pressure-cooker atmosphere, and barely making the grade as a Freshman ""plebe,"" Jake has one last shot at proving he has what it takes to become an officer in an institution that boasts a venerable 137-year history of focused discipline and determined excellence. With nothing left to lose, Jake decides to enter the notoriously fierce Navy boxing competition known as the Brigade Championships--and face off against his arch-nemesis, Midshipman Lt. Cole. Everything Jake has ever hoped for stands in the balance: the chance to make his father proud, to validate his Lieutenants faith in him, to stand up for his fellow plebes, and most of all, to forge a different future.

By hard work work and a break he gets into the Naval Academy where he is considered an outsider because of his attitude and lack of desire to ask for help, Yes, of course there is a woman, there is always a woman!!!!!!! The Film however is fun. The film does have one shortcoming when he and the company commander do not see eye to eye and the LT always states that he knows what a real officer is and what makes them good! Yet, I don't see that he does. An officer doesn't make it personal and he wouldn;'t allow those who are overweight to stay so. He also doesn't think he is better then every other officer either. Despite this the fiklem is fun, well acted and it was nice to see the personal growth of the cadet and how the uperclasss chief handles her feelings for him and his for her for a year. I have left some out but overall it is a nice romantic, peresonal growth and is realistic in that we do have guys like this in the service alot.

2553250,3,B000F6IODE,"This is really a boxing flick, although there is a sub-plot in there somewhere about a bunch of young people trying to make it through their first year of Annapolis.  The Naval Academy, along with West Point and the Air Force Academy, is well-known for its hazing and tough first year.  The protagonist of this one is a rough-cut young man with an aptitude for boxing.  The plot really focuses on his shot at the Academy boxing championship.  The result of all of this is that the plot, if there is one, is confused because this film never really decides what it wants to be about: surviving the first year of Annapolis, or boxing.

A watchable movie but not what I was expecting.  RJB.",1260144000,,686,4.491935483870968
2553251,3,B000F6IODE,"It's like `An Officer and a Gentleman' meets `Antwone Fisher' meets `Rocky', but nowhere near as good as the first two (yes, we all know that I think `Rocky' is an overrated mediocre film).  Yes, there isn't much new to `Annapolis', and sadly it doesn't really handle anything in a way to create anything remotely memorable.  It's a clich&eacute; ridden rip-off film that has a few selected moments that make it enjoyable, but there is nothing here that would warrant any deep-seated affection.

The performances run the gamut from poor (Tyrese Gibson) to decent (James Franco) to pretty darn good (Vicellous Reon Shannon), and then you have the barely there performances, like that from the gorgeous (Demi Moore/Jennifer Connelly love child) Jordana Brewster.

The film tells of Jake Huard, a young man who dreams of the Navy.  When he finally gets his chance he finds that his stubborn and aggressive nature makes it difficult for him to adapt to life in the academy.  With the help of a beautiful woman, a caring Lieutenant and his own determination, Jake is able to...box?  Yes, that's right; he boxes.  There is a boxing competition open to everyone in the academy, which give Jake the opportunity to exact some pain on Cole, his nemesis and resident jerk.

Littered with clich&eacute;s that come one right after the other, `Annapolis' never finds its own footing.  It borrows far too much from far too many other films.  It plays out like a poor mans `An Officer and a Gentleman', with no one able to step up to the plate and deliver something noteworthy.  Vicellous Reon Shannon was my favorite part of the film, even if his character was the biggest clich&eacute; the film had to offer (SPOILER:  the overweight African American who is mistreated, rises above, gets shot back down and attempts to take his own life).  Shannon played the role flawlessly, and I believed in him, connected to him, and absolutely adored him.

But aside from that, I'm left empty handed.

I will say that the films pacing was brisk and the visuals were a nice touch (especially the fight sequences).  It's a `pretty' movie.

With Tyrese playing just another variation of Louis Gossett Jr.'s Oscar winning role (which wasn't deserving of an Oscar in the first place) and James Franco trying to be charming while keeping an edge (which he only manages to accomplish SOME of the time), `Annapolis' falls in the middle.

It's not bad but it feels very `been there done that'.",1256601600,,2458,4.823389021479714

2553253,3,B000F6IODE,"I will start this review by saying Annapolis is not a bad film, that however does not necessarily mean that it's a good film either. The problem with Justin Lin's first major studio outing is that the viewer gets a strange sense of deja vu as he or she watches the film.

Annapolis is a hybrid crossing of An Officer and a Gentleman meets Rocky. Jake Huard (James Franco)is a blue collar worker who wants to shoe the world that he can make it as a Naval officer by attending Annapolis and breaking free of his shipyard bound friends. Given this chance he tries to do it alone and begins to fall deeper and deeper into failure. With the help of a fellow student and potential love interest(Jordana Brewster) he beins to train for the Brigades the annual boxing tournament. The boxing ring is also Huard's chance to deal with a grudge bearing senior officer.

The film tries its best to be completely politically correct and this plus every sports movie cliche in the book tends to hurt the overall film. The disc includes a making of featurette, a sequence on the boxing scenes, some deleted scenes and a running commentary from director Lin, screenwriter David Collard and the film editor.

2553256,3,B000F6IODE,"While I didn't mind the approach this movie took which is different from the typical prove-yourself-in the military theme, I really didn't see the point of this film.

Was Midshipman Cole really trying to oust Plebe Huard?  I didn't get that impression at all.  Tyrese played the character a little too cool.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to hurt the guy or help the guy.

Franco did pretty decently as the kid without any support who wanted the Naval Academy bad enough and was trying to prove himself that he wasn't just a nobody.

But it was in the ring with the gloves on where the rubber met the road and where he would ""find himself.""  At least it was supposed to be.

You are rooting for Franco because he is the underdog.  You get the impression he's the underdog, but there wasn't really much ""oomph"" to this film to really grip you and make you want to sympathize with the character, or any of the characters for that matter.

Couldn't tell if this was trying to emulate Rocky or Officer and a Gentlemen.  It didn't really do a good job of either.

Cinematography and the editting is great.  Very good soundtrack.  Resonant, triumphant yet humble. The theme music is suitable to the main character, but the story was just....meh.

Ashton Kutcher's The Guardian was more interesting.

Watchable to pass the time, but not one of Franco's best movies.  I'd skip it.",1245369600,,1376,4.573770491803279

brings me to my rating. the 2 stars are for the blu-ray disc not the film.
at many points in the film the picture and sound simply doesn't have the
zest and bite you expect a blu-ray disc to have. i recently found out there
are two ways of burning a blu-ray disc, one an expensive way the other a
cheaper less expensive way . i'm guessing they chose the cheaper way for this blu-ray disc.",1233878400,,540,4.05607476635514
2553261,2,B000F6IODE,"Don't get me wrong.  I liked both films, just don't think they make that good of combination, particularly if neither of the plotlines is that well developed.

Story in brief:  Jason Huard (James Franco) made a promise to his Mom before she died that he'd go to Annapolis.  He didn't quite fit in, but persistence pays off--particularly if you ask your Congressman 34 times for a recommendation.

Once he gets into Annapolis, it seems the one thing Huard has going for him is his ability to box.  Whether that will keep him in the school remains to be seen.

If you liked ""Rocky"" and ""Officer"", you might like this film, but there's neither enough boxing or military training and discipline in the story to make it truly stand out.

I will say this: best scene in the movie is at the end when the Dad gives the kid a nod of approval.  That's all he ever wanted!",1228348800,,284,3.65
2553273,3,B000F6IODE,"This movie had strong acting (with great actors and actresses), the plot could have been more interesting, and the ending was sub-par. This movie is worth watching, but not paying $20.00 for a DVD.",1211241600,,197,4.823529411764706
2553274,3,B000F6IODE,"It is always an interesting thing when one starts watching a movie and expects it to be about a certain subject and then the movie shifts half-way to an entirely tangential subject. From Dusk till Dawn is the epitome of this effect. But whereas it was deliberate in that movie since Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez each contributed to half the script, you can tell Annapolis does this more because the writer or director lost the narrative thread half-way in.

The movie starts out like the flick Rudy, with James Franco playing a blue collar kid who - instead of a steel mill - works in a shipyard and who - instead of Notre Dame - wishes he could attend Annapolis. Unlike Rudy though, Annapolis delves only skin deep into his passion to attend the naval academy and sidesteps the cumbersome process of explaining how hard it was for an average kid with average grades to get in to one of the best military and educational training programs in the US. The first half of the movie progresses with more of the same about how hard it is for a blue collar kid to ""make it"" when he is thrust into the ring with elites.

The movie shifts about half-way when - for reasons that are largely unsupported - Franco's character decides to focus all his angst on a boxing match with his commanding officer Cole, played by Tyrese Gibson channeling Louis Gossett Jr. from An Officer and a Gentleman. This is where the movie moves from ""oh my life is so tough being from the wrong side of the tracks"" to - basically - Rocky.

I debated giving this movie two stars, but in the end it isn't atrocious. It is watchable and I didn't turn it off, which I have with other movies. It skirted the line, but it is an ok movie to spend time with if there's nothing else available.",1204675200,,1762,4.432098765432099

2553277,4,B000F6IODE,"Product as described, thank you. Not the greatest movie, not on point with what actually goes on at the Naval Academy.",1200614400,,118,4.666666666666667
2553278,3,B000F6IODE,"Some movies are so by the book and clichd that you can see what's coming in the story a mile away, and that's just from watching the previews, so as you can imagine when you begin watching the film the feeling is just as obvious. Most of these movies wind up going Direct-to-DVD, but there are a few that make it to theaters, though not with much box office success. Most of these films are not too well received by movie audiences or critics, but every once in a while one of these run-of-the-mill movies sneaks through and actually offers a few new ideas or perspectives on some old ones that makes the movie rise above average and win over some audiences and maybe even a few critics along the way. One instance of an average movie rising above its Direct-to-DVD destiny would be the military/sports themed movie ""Annapolis"".

""Annapolis"" tells the story of Jake Huard (James Franco), a hot-headed shipbuilder's son whose dream is to fulfill his late mother's belief that he could make it in the navy. After gaining acceptance into Annapolis, Jake soon discovers that achieving his goals is going to be much harder than he initially thought, thanks in no small part to his tough-as-nails commanding officer Lt. Coal (Tyrese Gibson), a marine assigned to the school as a new instructor. As Jake struggles to keep his anger against Lt. Coal in check, he soon realizes that the only way to prove to Coal, and all other's who didn't believe in him along the way, is to settle their differences in the ring while participating in the annual boxing matches known as 'The Brigades'.

As I said earlier, ""Annapolis"" is a movie where pretty much everything has been done before, but there are a few surprises in the story along the way. As clichd as the movie may be, it is still a fairly enjoyable movie, that presents your standard underdog story in a different way by combining a sports movie with a military themed movie. This concept worked very well for the movie, and is a big part of why ""Annapolis"" was better than expected. Sure, I could see where the story was going to end up by the end of the movie, who couldn't; but the way the story was broken up between the standard Naval training and the boxing training, gave a nice mix of drama and action that managed to keep me entertained.

The performances in the movie were all fairly solid with some unevenness, a few moments felt strange or out of place, but these were few and far between. James Franco's (""Spiderman 3"") performance seemed the most flat, he didn't really show many emotions, and his facial expressions and voice remained fairly even so determining what his character was feeling proved to not always be easy. When he did choose to show emotion on his face and in his vocal inflections, I thought they seemed a bit forced, a good example of this would be when he yells at his Dad out of nowhere about not being supportive. I generally think James Franco is a solid actor, and he played the part of the stoic hero well, though he should have shown more emotions and varied the tone of his voice, this was definitely not his best work. On the other hand, Tyrese Gibson (""Transformers"") is an actor who was perfect for his role, and his delivery though very even as well, was dead-on for his character. You may be asking why Tyrese's, some would say wooden, performance was accepted and not Franco's. The difference is that Tyrese's character isn't really experiencing an emotional journey, whereas James' character Jake is enduring what to him is a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs. In that respect Tyrese nailed the part, where I felt Franco dropped the ball. The supporting cast led by Donnie Wahlberg (""Saw 2""), Chi McBride (""I, Robot""), and Jordana Brewster (""The Fast and the Furious"") were all well suited for their respective characters. Although, I personally felt that Wahlberg's character was underutilized, he just seems to pop-up every once in a while, but when he does he essentially steals the scenes with great ease. Brewster as a trainer and future love interest for Jake was a good choice for showing both the military's acceptance of women in positions of authority, and as the only obvious outlet to squeeze some unneeded love story element into the movie, not to mention the men needed some eye candy to behold. Lastly, Chi McBride had probably the least to do in this movie, even less than Donnie Wahlberg, but he managed to make the best use of his time on the screen.

Even though ""Annapolis"" is as by the book of a movie as you can get, it still managed to do a good job of entertaining me, and even educating me in some instances, and that's never a bad thing. It's a shame that the movie didn't strive for more, because this could have been a much better film, and possible great military movie rather than just an average one with some highlights along the way.

""Annapolis"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1195171200,,4916,4.626575028636885
2553279,2,B000F6IODE,"I purchased this title as part of the Amazon ""Buy One Get One Free"" offer on Blu-ray titles last month.  I needed to pick up an extra disc, since there were only three I wanted, so I grabbed this.

This movie was mediocre at best.  It never really drew me in.  In fact, I'd say it was borderline a waste of time.  It's really a rip-off of ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", as well as about every 3rd low-budget boxing movie that has come out in the past few years.

If I were in the Navy, I would probably be afraid people in the other services would laugh at me because of it.

Pass on purchasing this one.  Rent only if really bored, and you've seen everything else on the shelf.",1195084800,2,677,4.114503816793893
2553280,4,B000F6IODE,"In many ways, this film seemed more realistic and believable than ""An Officer and a Gentleman"".  I remember a scene in ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" where Lou Gosset Jr's character has a bare-fisted fight with Richard Gere.  Both of them fight as if they were martial arts experts.  First of all it's highly unlikely that they would know how to fight like that and also both the Sergeant and the Officer candidate would be kicked out of the school for hurting each other like that.  In this film, there is fighting but it's believable in that it's in the boxing ring.  When fighting does happen outside of the ring however there are consequences.  Another thing is that people in leadership roles in the military (particularly for special units and schools) will almost never put pressure on a candidate to give up.  If the candidate can't meet the high standards, it's only a matter of time before he will drop out or be dropped.  In this film Tyrese Gibson's character (the company comander) is at odds with James Franco the plebe, but he doesn't go great lengths to try to get him to quit like is done ""An Officer and a Gentleman"".  Actually, the company comander gives James Franco's character a big break which made the film for me.",1186963200,,1236,4.607305936073059
2553281,1,B000F6IODE,"I had to fast forward on this 'heroic' epic. Poor boy makes good against all the odds, including himself; with the world firmly applauding. Some attempts at acting are made which are then substituted with sporting scenes. James Franco looking reasonably good, but that's where it stops.

Patriotic schmaltz, drivel and clichs abounding, this film is only for the diehards of this genre. Seen one once then you have seen this already 20 times before. The shallow love interest in an unbelievable situation only serves to lure male viewers into watching a matter of hidden sexual dominance being played out. He's all macho and so is she. Cringe! Annoyingly too, the film is overloaded with music in the wrong places.

If you look hard enough you'll recognise that the location is the Royal Naval College at Greenwich in London, UK.",1181692800,4,829,4.914285714285715
2553292,2,B000F6IODE,"This is the story of a very, very stupid boy - Jake, played with blandness by John Franco - who somehow (and for no good reason) was accepted into the naval academy, and made his way through it by boxing and being stubborn.

The relationships in the film were utterly unbelievable - all of them, from the misplaced romantic interest to the big bad naval officer who used to be a marine (what was that about?) who made it his life's goal to see Jake booted out. Even that of Jake's last roommate (one of his roommate's was kicked out, another left because Jake was bringing him down - but HOW?), who stood as his Arkansas to Jake's Mississippi. ""Arkansas"" was a bit chubby, and had to lose gobs of weight to make it through the standard training course, and after four solid months of hard training, Arkansas couldn't climb one rung higher, and he hadn't lost a pound. How'd that work out?

It was my intention to draw parallels to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Officer-and-a-Gentleman/dp/B00003CXBT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Officer and a Gentleman</a>, amongst others, but it seems as if everyone has beaten me to it.",1175126400,2,1170,5.12041884816754
2553293,1,B000F6IODE,"This movie is cliche-ridden from start to finish. A young man from the shipyards gets into Annapolis at the last minute, is miserably ill-prepared, overcomes all obstacles, and pulls off a feat no plebe could ever hope to accomplish. All the stock characters are here--cold father; abusive commander; sympathetic, pretty junior officer; the guy who doesn't make it; the guy who tries to commit suicide when he fails; the bad plebe turned good guy. Plus, you see every twist and turn of the plot coming from a mile away. I thought it was a waste of time.",1171152000,,553,4.711340206185567
2553294,2,B000F6IODE,"From the moment that we are introduced to the main characters in Annapolis, it becomes apparent who is going to do what and what is going to happen.  Annapolis revolves around Jake (James Franco), a ship builder's son with big dreams of being a naval officer.  Naturally, he's the underdog who seeks to come out on top, with Tyrese Gibson providing his superior officer and rival who lets him know that he ""won't make it"".  Throw in an annual boxing tournament and everyone involved, and Annapolis transforms into Rocky in the Navy; only the real loser of the bout turns out being the viewer.  Franco and Gibson are stiff and wooden, the screenplay is cliche ridden, predictable, goes out of it's way to be politically correct and inoffensive, and sometimes just non-sensical (apparently eating candy bars wrapped in Wonder Bread can help one achieve a chisled physique) while the inevitable outcome will surprise no one at all.  Jordana Brewster is here for looks and not much else, and poor Donnie Wahlberg and Chi McBride are two of the very few bright spots in this otherwise boring crowd pleaser.  With Justin Lin directing, Annapolis is a disappointment considering how surprisingly lively Better Luck Tomorrow was, but then again, I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this film to begin with, and you shouldn't either.",1167696000,4,1326,4.897321428571429
2553295,5,B000F6IODE,"For those who would lead you to believe that this film is a ripoff of an officer and a gentleman they're wrong. On the surface one might come to that conclusion but when you peel away the obvious similar exterior you find a much more rewarding movie. This is due to the wonderful direction of Lin and the exceptional acting of James Franco. Franco proves beyond a doubt he has the acting ""chops"" to stay around for a long time. Despite his smaller frame and lighter weight he actually made me believe he was capable of going toe to toe with his larger and more muscular adversary. The time will fly by and you will just love this one. A keeper!",1166227200,3,644,4.330578512396694

And who doesn't like Jordana Brewster, right?

Well.  The combination didn't work, OK?  It didn't work.  It had an interesting story about this kid who was literally from the other side of town who grew up looking at the naval academy from the other side of the river wanting to one day get in.  Jake - that was his name, right? - ends up getting accepted at the last minute (thanks to Donnie Wahlberg) and for the first half of the movie, he's a [...].

He's helping his roommate, he's training for boxing, he's learning the credo, he's impressing his instructors.  Complete opposite from what he was before - he's even friendly.

He lost weight, he finished the course, he tried to kill himself and LIVED, and decided to move on with his life.  He was Arkansas.  That was who got me through the movie.

2553330,3,B000F6IODE,"Annapolis takes elements from all of the truly excellent military movies of our time and uses them to create this new and exciting military drama.  James Falco stars as Jake Huard, the hometown boy who boxes, works as a ship builder, and has always dreamed of a life in the navy.  Before his mother died, she made him promise he would attend the naval academy.  Huard spends years trying to make sure that he keeps this promise.  His character has many of the same elements that made us love Richard Gere in An Officer and a Gentleman and Matthew Modine from Full Metal Jacket. Throughout the film he strives to make the transformation from a guy who dreams of being in the navy to an actual officer through and through. To this end, he attempts to prove himself by trying to win the Naval Academy Brigade boxing competition and proving that he really is good enough to be there.

Before his first day at the academy he meets a cute girl (Jordana Brewster) at a bar who turns out to be one of his superior officers at the academy.  Brewster's character supports Jake throughout his attempts to fit in and helps him train for the Naval Academy Brigade boxing matches.  She's got hints of Debra Winger from An Officer and A Gentleman and all the best moves from Demi Moore in A Few Good Men.  Then there's the tragic character who you know is just there to let you know how hard it really is to try to fit in.  Much like Vincent D'Onofrio in Full Metal Jacket, Huard's friend is overweight and works twice as hard as everyone else while constantly being berated about his size by his superior officers.  Tyrese Gibson stars as the Louis Gossett Jr.-like superior officer who grills Huard constantly and wants to make sure that he's the best officer he can be.  And Donnie Wahlberg rounds out the supporting cast as the lieutenant who knew from the start that Huard had greatness in him.

This movie steals elements from the best, but doesn't do so as outright copying and instead makes it fit its own elements.  The boxing competition is at the forefront of the film, but it's got enough of the military element to make it a nice mixture for anyone who likes movies like Rocky, Full Metal Jacket and An Officer and a Gentleman.  It's not nearly as good as any of those films, but it's a fun film to watch with plenty of action and excitement.",1151798400,2,2340,4.475294117647059

2553332,4,B000F6IODE,"""Annapolis' is the inspiring tale of young man who wants the respect of others, but first he must learn to respect himself.  Yes, it plays like a lightweight mix of ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" and ""Rocky"", but that's fine by me, as those are two of my favorite movies ever.  What the film lacks in depth, it gains from being very inspiring and entertaining, and the leads (James Franco and Tyrese Gibson) have loads of charisma.  I do think this film was a bit faster-paced than it could have been.  The boxing and training sequences were quite well done.  All in all, very enjoyable.",1151625600,4,585,4.533333333333333
2553333,3,B000F6IODE,"Jake Huard leaves his job in the shipyard to join the naval academy, where he and the others are humiliated by the cruel officer Cole. Jake isn't obedient enough and Cole develops a personal grudge against him, and - for that reason, it seems - Huard decides not to quit, and sets out to challenge Cole in the boxing ring.

This is part boxing movie and part military movie. Much of it is quite predicatble. The movie offers few surprises, but still, this film would probably please fans of boxing and/or military films, who don't expect many surprises. The acting is quite good and fans of the handsome James Franco would want to check this movie out. I wouldn't buy it, especially not at full price, but it's worth renting.",1151539200,2,725,4.576923076923077
2553334,3,B000F6IODE,"From the graphics, trailer, and cover of the DVD, ANNAPOLIS looks as though it is a movie about life in military training.  And, yes, there are scenes showing the rigorous training these young men receive on their way to becoming Navy officers.  But quickly after the Annapolis portion of the film begins the story turns into yet another young boxer proves himself through his sport story and not a very powerful one at that.  For those expecting something more, then best to look at other films from the past about military training.

The plot is full of clichs, each of which has a weak lead-in and an easy-to-predict ending.  Thee are some good actors assigned to the cast - James Franco (more buff than he has ever looked!), Jordana Brewster, Donnie Wahlberg, and some strong supporting cast members, but the story never involves us beyond a head-nodding 'yes, I've seen this before' status.  It is a piecemeal work, some of the pieces being sensitive but most being disposable.  The story doesn't seem to have a point except that of life in the first year of Annapolis is tough, that those in charge may seem really mean but they all have heart, and the good underdogs make the best of a bad situation.

But if you like boxing movies, this one has a lot of time in the ring and for that audience ANNAPOLIS will please.  Grady Harp, June 06",1151539200,4,1344,4.589958158995816
2553335,3,B000F6IODE,"Thankfully I rented this moving before I bought it.  While it was somewhat entertaining it is one movie whose rewatchability is almost zero.  The ending was unfulfilling and the last boxing match should have been done differently.  If you must have it, wait for a couple months and it will be under $10 in no time...",1151539200,,316,4.607142857142857
