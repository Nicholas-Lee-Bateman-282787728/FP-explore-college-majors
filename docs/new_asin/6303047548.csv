544905,3,6303047548,I bought this because it said in great shape. But it has that thick white line of fuzz at the bottom half way through the movie. It might be only the tracking but I couldn't seem to get it to play right.,1209168000,,203,3.857142857142857
544906,5,6303047548,"I've seen both this and the remake.  This is by far the better.  The acting is better, the characterizations more believable, and some of the dialogue I would put in a class with Shakespeare and Lois Bujold.  The remake merely has a bigger budget, so the picture quality is better.
But it is as a *story* that this movie shines, for we are shown the world through the eyes of a young girl just on the leading edge of her womanhood, thrown into immortal peril, and given both a terrible choice and a great responsibility.  Winnie and all the  Tucks are brought to vibrant life, and we can empathize with each of them, and the joys and burdens their unwanted gifts bring them.
I mentioned dialogue earlier, and to this day I cannot think about Jesse Tuck's reply to the Sheriff's warning without shivering at just how profound that reply is. For that exchange alone, I would watch this movie again and again.
I hope and pray that THIS edition finally finds its way to DVD, where it, like the Tucks, may live forever.",1067558400,29,1014,4.489130434782608
544907,5,6303047548,"I saw this movie many years ago.  Like many, I can't find it anywhere unless I pay an outrageous amount for it.  Since the new release, I can't get the original out of my mind.  This is a movie that needs to be released again(1981).",1065312000,4,232,4.111111111111111
544908,5,6303047548,"The new Tuck Everlasting stinks. It has completely lost the ""family"" spirit that made the 1981 version so special.
 It completely leaves out the final line of the original movie, which really gives the watcher the feeling that perhaps living forever isn't really what the average person thinks it's cracked up to be. I really miss the whole story told the first time making the whole story of the ""fountain of youth tree"" almost believeable. The idea of moving with carnivals makes sense, it sure is a way to stay anonymous. The making of merry-go-round wooden horses in the original Tuck is shorn down to one piece of a scene with John Hurt scraping wood. yuk. All the talk about killing was never in the original movie, ""I guess I'll go kill the Huns now. When the original Tucks were getting suspicious they simply moved to stay out of others way, they didn't KILL the people that found them out, except one who wanted to sell the water to rich people. That line I really miss is "" Everything changes with time, 'ceptn us""",1063584000,13,1025,4.570652173913044
544909,5,6303047548,"This is the first of the two Tuck movies made based on the Natalie Babbitt novel and, in my opinion, the only one worth watching.
It takes you in and brings to life the fantasy of living forever. A beautiful story retold with matching imagery...made me believe as I lived the dream from in front of my television set.
Wonderful!",1059177600,9,328,4.483333333333333
544910,4,6303047548,I remember seeing this show years ago. I loved the movie than and I loved the new release of the movie. I took 5 of my children to watch the new release and they loved it! They never seen the movie in 1981. This is a great movie and it leaves you with all kinds of feelings. Part of you wanted her to drink the water and live forever with Jessie,1034467200,8,345,3.8732394366197185
544911,3,6303047548,"I remember bits and pieces of this movie on 'Showtime' or 'HBO', so long ago. It's about this 15 year old girl in old 'Victorian Era'( horse and carage era),she meets this family deep in the woods,and they tell her of there everlasting life by drinking from a magic spring. They invite her to join them with everlasting life by drinking some of the water,but she can't decide,so they leave her some water and say they'll be back in 50 or 100 years. 100 years later they return to a town full of cars and sidewalks trying to locate her,they find her,they find her grave. On the grave 'dear wife and mother',later they discover she gave the water to the frog that she carried in her pocket. For me very spooky and haunting back then. Tried to remember the title of this movie,but so long ago until the remake,too late,oh well.",1032393600,3,824,4.4635761589403975
544912,2,6303047548,"This movie was not very true to the book. The man in the yellow suit didn't wear a yellow suit, Winnie had a turtle, not a frog. . etc. It was pretty well made, but if you are a great fan of the book you might not like it. The new version made in 2002 is a little more accurate to the book, so you might try that as an alternate to this. The story of this movie is pretty good though, because the book was a very good book. People who remember this movie from their childhood might like this, though. I didn't really like it because it strayed too far from the book, but others might.",1030320000,2,584,3.957627118644068
7835909,5,6303047548,This enchanting original move is FAR better than the Disney one that came later!  I'm very thankful to have been able to obtain it on VHS --- but cannot understand why it's NOT also on DVD!  It NEEDS to be made available on DVD and/or Blu-ray... and I WANT a copy of it in one of those two disk formats.  Please DO it!!,1503014400,,319,4.031746031746032
7835910,5,6303047548,"This version is so much better than the Disneyfied version that there is hardly any comparison.

(Edited from my Disney review) The characters are much more interesting, the action truer to the original Natalie Babbitt book, the sweet is sweeter, the evil eviler. It's too easy to portray evil as a leering, sneering, menacing ""man in yellow"". How much harder (and better) to put a pleasant face on it and let the actions speak for themselves.

Surely there is enough of a market for this classic that the copyright owners could re-release it on DVD. I have the VHS version, but no longer own a VHS player. I recognize that adding subtitles to a DVD would require some work, but they could be transcribed from a VHS copy in a few hours.",1482883200,2,736,4.568181818181818

7835912,5,6303047548,"I have also watched and reviewed the Alexis Bledel version of this story.
This version had no actors I recognized and that may have been in its favor.
I enjoyed it a great deal.",1393113600,,177,4.235294117647059
7835913,2,6303047548,"I bought this to show to my students after we read the book in class, but there were so many changes! In fact, the whole opening was a scene which was never in the movie and had characters all in one place who never were together in the book. The movie might be fine - if you haven't read the book.",1372032000,,298,3.901639344262295
7835914,5,6303047548,"very good family movie, great for any and all ages, I have both this one and the remake in 2002, they are both
awesome, but if I could only watch one or the other it would be this one, original is always best I think.",1362268800,,217,3.8444444444444446
7835915,4,6303047548,It is hard to believe I paid this much for a VHS tape but I'm glad I did.  I find this version much better than the new one.  It seems to be a simpler story with out the over-acting.  They never show it on TV so I had to get it.  One of the things I really like about it is the haunting music and the ending on this one.,1346457600,4,320,3.5285714285714285
7835916,5,6303047548,"I only have one question & one complaint about the original (& for all that matter, the only one, as the remake is nothing close to this gem...no offense to those who participated in its making...but there are some movies, such as ""It's a Wonderful Life"", that should never be remade unless they intend to spend the denarii necessary to keep essentially the same as the original...well, for that matter, they should just never be remade. The disaster of ""Miracle on 34th St"" is a primary example.  And so is this film. I haven't seen it since the 80's or early 90's as the VHS got lost somewhere along the road of moving from WI to WA twice & a divorce after 24 yrs & well, you get the pic.  But when I watched the remake (at the time I didn't really notice b/c I was just so thrilled to see the movie) it didn't take long to realize something was rotten in Denmark, & it wasn't tomatoes. Only then did I look at the details of the cover to realize in horror (but also a relief b/c i realized i wasn't going nuts afterall...at least not yet...that there was an original that was really good) that this was a remake.
So, back to my question & complaint.  There both one in the same. And that is, when is this coming out on DVD? That's all folks.
Oh. PS. To those who compare movies to the books & complain about how hey fail dramatically to stay true to the text, I believe years of experience should have taught us by now that with a very few exceptions, on very rare occasions does a movie stand up w/it's book.  Having said that I believe the reason(s) is/are simple.  We are using different sensory inputs to our brains. I know that may seem too simplified but hey, i'm blessed w/ADHD & if there's one thing i've learned about that, is that i tend to look at things differently than normsies.  If i go to a movie after reading the book & have some sort of expectation of it staying on course with the book, then i've already lost the whole reason for going to the movie in the 1st place...and that's to have fun! I let my brain relax so i can get into the movie & enjoy the ride. And if i find myself still standing at the train station 1/2-way thru the movie, it's either b/c I had some sort of expectations on the movie, which leads me to look for certain things in the movie, which leads me to missing key parts or much of the movie b/c I'm in hyper-focus, super-frustrated mode & then to add insult to injury i will realize, & wonder, why i just wasted money on the movie, which also means i will be even more frustrated if i have to pay to go back & rewatch it to try & find what i missed, or just complain that it was a lousy movie, not placing the blame where it really belongs...solely square on my shoulders...you get the picture.  Either wait to read the book, or if too late, just forget you read it & enjoy the movie, especially if your taking kids!  It's like riding on a Harley & then getting into a VW Thing & basing your experience by comparing the 2...i don't know if that came out right by i hope u get my drift...Go w/o any expectations, like it's a whole different ride,  If you're really into reading (which i wish we did more but that's a whole other story), then think of your reading as a Cadillac, a Lincoln Continental, a Rolls Royce (in fact, if you want a little history lesson w/Rolls Royce, read what they had to learn from their experience of trying to do to the the GM Turbo-hydromatic 400 transmission what they did to their engine.  i'll help you along.
Rolls Royce machines their engine parts so close in tolerance that they don't need or use gaskets. Everything fit so tight.  So they figured when they started to use the GM TH-400 automatic transmission in their cars, they decided to do the very same thing...machine everything so close in tolerance that they wouldn't need gaskets.  Problem is, automatic transmission have internal leakage built into them for a reason. So when they put it all back together & started it up & tried to drive, well, instead of a nice smooth drive, they were jolted in their seats.
So you see folks, when you're going to the movies, just remember what you drove up in, & when you walk thru the doors of the theater, think about them as the doors to your new vehicle...what kind of car do you want to watch...or what the hey...what kind of car do you want to see yourself driving in the movie?  When you go to a James Bond movie, are you seeing if it stays true to the book, or are you imagining yourself behind the wheel of that Astin-Martin?  Sorry, but when i'm watching a movie i don't have time to think about the book. that's for after the drive, when you & your spouse & the kids talk about it & have some...quality time with them...find out what they were driving during the movie. But if you're too busy thinking about the book during the movie, you'll find yourself frustrated, angry, jealous b/c you're missing out on the fun your kids & wife are having talking about the movie, & when they ask you, you'll find yourself muttering ""I can't talk now, i'm driving...!"" w/that, i'm outta here...go see this movie...oh and uh...leave your book back in the Mercedes & get ready to go dirt biking, or even a scooter! Just get out of the car! & if u got kids, don't forget the helmets! ;-D",1316822400,2,5265,4.305050505050505
7835917,5,6303047548,This is a very special movie and I was so glad to be able to find it.  It was my son's favorite movie when he was a little boy. The seller delivered it promptly and I had no problems whatsoever. Thanks so much.,1290470400,,210,3.883720930232558
