4934858,5,B00634MLO0,"I would encourage anyone to upgrade their older VHS or DVD movies to at least Bluray 2D quality (3D for those who have 3D grade TVs) as the quality of the picture is 100% better then VHS tapes and nearly 50% better then DVD's. The sound quality has been improved and upgraded as well. Most Blu-rays have many more features that can be viewed as well which make for a much fuller movie experience too! Oh and just so you know, even if you don't own a Bluray movie you should go buy an on sale Bluray player. Why? Because a Bluray player scans the disk many more times than just a standard DVD player, that it will even make your older DVD movies look much better. That is, as long as you have a flat screen type of TV that was purchased in the last five years. Good luck and go get some!",1354752000,7,786,4.1103896103896105

4934860,5,B00634MLO0,"This is my first WB Triple Feature blu-ray set so I was a little weary of how these sets would be produced mainly due to some pretty crummy standard DVD sets I've seen over the years. Luckily with these blu-rays, this doesn't seem to be a problem.  Like the previous reviewer has said, you get each film on its own individual disc complete with its own special features.

  I won't go into specific reviews but overall I am extremely happy with this Nature Gone Wild-themed set. Here you get the two 4-star movies Twister and Poseidon as well as the 3-star, made for tv feel movie The Perfect Storm.  All three look and sound amazing and are sure to entertain for years to come without losing a single pixil or color scheme.",1342569600,17,724,4.454545454545454
4934861,5,B00634MLO0,"I've seen these DVD sets in the past that have ""Double Features"" and it's sometimes one movie one each side of the disc, or both movies on one side, and you choose which movie you want with the menu. It was very low budget, in my opinion.

This Blu Ray ""Triple Feature"" actually has all THREE movies on their own disc, but in one case. It has dividers, just like a CD double album.

I was very surprised and satisfied.

So, for the price of $9.99 ( that was what I paid here on Amazon ) you get THREE Blu Ray movies.

4934906,4,B00634MLO0,"BOTTOM LINE: Trio of older natural disaster-themed films bundled together in a 3-disc Blu-ray set is a solid value. Recommended. 4 STARS

TWISTER is my favorite of the three. I always enjoy this brainless bad weather movie. I love the late Bill Paxton. His memorable turn as Pvt. Hudson in ALIENS was a classic role. Plus, he always seemed to be genuinely having fun while on camera, no matter what kind of part he was playing. I'll check out just about anything he's in. Helen Hunt is easy on the eyes and delivers her techno-speak fairly believably. Her rowdy gang of unkempt storm chasers are a goofy, fun bunch; the kind of guys you'd want to hang with after work for a beer. Cary Elwes makes for a suitably hiss-worthy corporate kiss-butt bad guy. The effects, though somewhat primitive by modern standards, are ambitious and still do their job nicely, plus the non-stop dangers are harmless fun to watch.

POSEIDON is a well-mounted but ultimately pointless remake of the seminal granpappy of the star-studded disaster genre. Competent at every turn, but frankly the only fun comes from figuring out which old Poseidon Adventure characters these new actors are supposed to be playing - and who will live or die. The whole thing looks pretty good, but sadly the film feels rushed and the characters so under-developed that you really don't get to know enough about them to care who makes it and who bites the big one. A pretty serious flaw. I'm a big Kurt Russel fan though, so if he's in something, I'll check it out.

THE PERFECT STORM is a well-done but grim outing. Being based on tragic real life events, there's no way to honestly tell anything other than a relentlessly sad and ultimately depressing tale. George Clooney & Co. are very believable in their respective roles of working class fishermen consigned to their fates due to pig-headed stubbornness & heartless corporate greed. It's all very well done, and director Wolfgang (DAS BOOT) Peterson faithfully captures the look & feel of the weary blue collar sword fishing industry quite well. Just don't watch this expecting a happy ending. Flick is still worth an occasional spin just for the quality of the acting. And I gotta give credit to the production team, cast & crew for having the balls to tell the story truthfully, without giving it some BS happy Hollywood ending. (Because like it or not, sometimes we need to be reminded that life isn't always happy & fun.)

THE BLU-RAYS: All 3 films all look & sound great. The special features for each film remain intact. In fact, the discs appear to be the same as when each movie was released individually, so you're getting all three movies complete in one space-saving package. This is an affordable deal for the casual film collector and anyone who's a fan of these kinds of films. Enjoyable time-killers to watch when the weather is nasty enough to keep you inside for the evening. ;-) 4 STARS.",1424563200,2,2919,4.7514792899408285

4934909,4,B00634MLO0,"This isn't really a review, but as I found the product description lacking, I decided to compile this list of helpful information below. I hope this will be useful for prospective buyers to know what they're getting:

TWISTER (1996): 113 minutes - Director: Jan de Bont - Starring: Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Phillip Seymour Hoffman - Genre: Action, disaster - Plot: Bill and Jo Harding, advanced storm chasers on the brink of divorce, must join together to create an advanced weather alert system by putting themselves in the cross-hairs of extremely violent tornadoes. PG-13

POSEIDON (2006): 98 minutes - Director: Wolfgang Petersen - Starring: Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell - Genre: Action, disaster- Plot: On New Year's Eve, the luxury ocean liner, Poseidon, capsizes after being swamped by a rogue wave. The survivors are left to fight for survival as they attempt to escape the sinking ship. PG-13

THE PERFECT STORM (2000): 130 minutes - Director: Wolfgang Petersen - Starring: George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane - Genre: Action, disaster - Plot: An unusually intense storm pattern catches some commercial fishermen unaware and puts them in mortal danger. PG-13

Now let's crunch some numbers. This collection costs $9.96, and contains 3 films. To find the value of the individual film you're getting, we divide the price by the number of films to get an individual price of $3.32 per film, an absolute steal for this thrilling and action-packed set of disaster films! I hope this information is useful to you. Cheers!",1418947200,,1532,5.116
4934910,5,B00634MLO0,"Director Wolfgang Petersen's POSEIDON with Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell plays much better today than when it was first released. This is essentially an interesting re-make of Irwin Allen's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE original released in 1972. It focuses more on suspense and special effects than character development and motivations that made the original THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE such a great sea epic. Josh Lucas seemed like an unlikely hero to lead the passengers to the surface through the bowels of the capsized SS Poseidon in Petersen's film. I found it so interesting that Kurt Russell took a second seat in many respects, because he has such a film presence as a natural born leader. Watching the film again recently, Josh Lucas gives a different kind of performance. He's kind of like the unexpected hero that rises to the occasion. It may or may not have worked, but Wolfgang Petersen's POSEIDON is suspenseful and it does have impressive effects that you can go back to admire the work that went into this film on a technical level.

I have come to love THE PERFECT STORM over the years. I suppose I expected something more when it first released. There was so much hype about the novel and the film. I see now that is such a personal story. Men who go down to the sea to make a living, trying to make a better life, men trying to survive day to day and not just men, but women too. In each crew member there lives a story. Dreams, love, the open air, the sea... they are such wonderful and noble things. I suppose I originally expected a story bigger than life, but THE PERFECT STORM is life, it is living and dying ...that is part of the circle. And James Horner's score, I see now that this is one of his greatest scores. It is beautiful, it is haunting, it is powerful and intimate. Director Wolfgang Petersen captured something special here. The characters and the cast that portrays them, all give powerful and moving performances. The amazing cast included George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane, William Fichtner, John C. Reilly, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, John Hawkes, Allen Payne, Christopher McDonald, Rusty Schwimmer, Janet Wright, Karen Allen, Michael Ironside and Joseph D. Reitman. That is how I feel about THE PERFECT STORM.

TWISTER is an interesting land based film that focuses on characters and one woman's eternal quest to meet nature face to face. It has a Saturday matinee quality to it and the cast of characters add to this beautifully. Director Jan de Bont takes an amazing story from a screenplay by Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin and gives its cast a chance to have fun with it. The whole idea of down home storm chasers, Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, trying to be outdone by corporate storm chasers, led by Cary Elwes, is quite amusing. A very animated Philip Seymour Hoffman as an over the top Dustin 'Dusty' Davis gives this film a lot of life. Once again the characters and good performances make this film work.

In all 3 films, mother nature takes on a personification of her own and like another character that drives conflict becomes an ominous and at times beautiful force.",1416268800,2,3126,4.753222836095764

I often sell the three DVDs that these replace at a profit compared to what I pay for one Triple Feature ($9.99), so I am actually making money by upgrading to Blu-Rays! They also have all of the special features, etc. Of course, all three of these look great on Blu-Ray, which can't be said for every DVD in my collection. No need to replace most films from the 1940s and 1950s with Blu-Ray and there are only a handful from the 1960's that look better. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove, Lolita, Yellow Submarine, Spartacus, Lawrence of Arabia, To Kill a Mockingbird, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Graduate, Psycho and the James Bond films comes to mind.

I jumped at the chance to purchase them item! I was even more excited when I received it the next day! But little did I know that I was in for disappointment. Just as any other movie purchase, I quickly inserted the a disk into my (brand new  just bought 5 days ago) blu-ray player. I started with the movie 'Twister', but it kept freezing my blu-ray player after 11 seconds. It wouldn't even make it to the menu screen. At first I thought perhaps there was something wrong with my player, but that was not the case. After the 'Twister' movie froze my player, I couldn't even turn the blu-ray player off - I had to unplug it from the wall! Thinking that was just a glitch, I moved on to the next movie 'Poseidon'. There were NO problems - played great! Even watched it four times, because the picture was so great! But then disappointment set in once again when I inserted 'the perfect storm' into my blu-ray player. AGAIN after just 11 seconds, the disk wouldn't play and my blu-ray player YET AGAIN completely froze. ----- SIMPLE RETURN? You would think so because a normal store purchase would return or exchange, but not amazon.

4934938,4,B00634MLO0,"So, I can never get enough of A Perfect Storm, I just think it's a great movie! I just love the story and I've always respected fishermen, their work is pretty bad-a** to be honest, and this film sort of gives a realistic view on that lifestyle.

Twister is nostalgic to me, it's the movie I watched on my first date ever, and I still enjoy it. Hadn't seen it in a long time before this purchase, and I must say; I still like it. It's not the best movie you'll ever see, but it's cool. If you think tornadoes and stuff are fun then this movie is something for you. Action for both men and women, even better if you're together. Some awesome members of the cast, like Phillipe Seymore Hoffman.

Poseidon: Don't really care for it, but I guess it's a decent movie for that one day when you don't really know what to watch, and you just wanna see something that's a totally average movie.",1357948800,2,885,4.261904761904762

4934941,3,B00634MLO0,"The movies are fine, Twister is one of my favorite movies ever. But I was disappointed with the blu-ray quality of Twister and Poseidon, The Perfect Storm was noticeable better, but the other two are very close to DVD quality. Probably a little better, but I'm still disappointed because they just don't look that great. Not much effort, if any, was put into restoring these. I guess I can't blame them, since these aren't blockbuster movies.

Each movie does come on its own full disc, so that is good. $10 is still a good price, even if these were standard DVD (even though they are close anyway) but I just can't give it more than 3 stars based on the poor blu ray quality.",1357171200,,676,4.451612903225806

I read the book before the movie was produced and I wasn't disappointed. It really condensed the book but it would have been a 6 hour production to give it full justice.

Twister is another of the generic 80s and 90s disaster movie genre. Good casting pitting the characters played by Helen Hunt and the late Bill Paxton. Another watchable movie based on the book by Michael Crichton. A book discussing the science and production of the movie,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twister-The-Science-of-Tornadoes-and-the-Making-of-an-Adventure-Movie/dp/0671000292/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twister: The Science of Tornadoes and the Making of an Adventure Movie</a>&nbsp;is well worth a read for adults and children.
