7316187,5,B010RGVMYO,This is fantastic! Very creative! The story is amazing and the acting was great and the graphics\CG was amazing!! can't wait for more!!! I would recommend this for any Sci-Fi fan! The soundtrack is epic!! I can't stress that enough. Great purchase!!  Looking forward to the full feature release.,1443571200,4,295,5.020408163265306
7316188,5,B010RGVMYO,"Excellent script and special effects.  Very good acting and just enough character development and background to make you interested in the two main characters.  Well worth the time and money to watch, whether you buy or rent.  It is a cliff-hanger, with several questions left unanswered, but I do know they are working on a 90 minute follow-up, which I'm sure will be of the same standards.  Great short and looking forward to more films done by Futuredude.",1443139200,4,458,4.833333333333333
7316189,5,B010RGVMYO,Absolutely love this film. Well produced. Great story. Liked the interaction between the husband and wife team. Looking forward to more.,1442880000,4,136,5.523809523809524
7316190,5,B010RGVMYO,"Perfect opening chapter for OCEANUS. Very immersive storytelling -- it really pulls you in to the characters and their story and, just when you think you've got it figured out, the whole game changes, and you realize the scope is going to be much broader than you imagined. I can hardly wait for Act Two.

(Must not forget to mention the score; it's perfect: captures the feeling and intensifies the mood.)",1442620800,2,406,4.71830985915493
7316191,5,B010RGVMYO,I was thoroughly impressed with Oceanus.  My only complaint was that I wanted to see more...now.  I can't get over that this is an independent production because it looks so polished and film-quality in execution.  Seeing some of the names attached to the production if the closing credits told me that this was something very special.  I was even more pleased that the production got distribution on Blu-Ray and digital media.  I bought it eight away even though I had only seen a snippet of it.  It was totally worth it.  I've already watched it more than once.  I hope th production team can crank out more...I'll be there when they do!,1442620800,10,639,4.642857142857143
7316192,5,B010RGVMYO,"Don't listen to the negative haters on this one. These guys gave it a shot to create a world and they pulled it off. BRAVO! Fantastic short film! Great cast, performances, writing, visual effects, and designs. Can't wait to see more. 30 minutes of solid entertainment! My only complaint is that I want more.",1442620800,7,307,4.703703703703703

If this is suppose to be some sort of series, it better come with room service for 4 bucks an episode 34 minutes each. Total rip off.",1455408000,6,276,3.7758620689655173

7316213,5,B010RGVMYO,"Enjoyed the first Act immensely and its nice to see originality in this story and excited to see what is to come.  Plus, having a story take place, not only in the future, but also underwater, is awesome.  I used to watch Seaquest DSV when it aired and Oceanus is helping fill the gap of that particular sci-fi genre for me.  Good job!!",1453766400,,336,4.301587301587301
7316214,5,B010RGVMYO,"Very clearly labeled as act one, I feel very pleased with the beginning of this story. I will be eagerly awaiting the next acts. Production value is amazing, lots of attention to detail. Much better than I expected. It's a shame it has negative reviews for being short. It has ""Act One"" right in the title... I don't think the creators could have labeled it more clearly.",1453680000,,371,4.552238805970149
7316215,5,B010RGVMYO,"If you loved Sealab: 2020, SeaQuest DSV, or any number of underwater sci-fi tales, you'll love Oceanus: Act One!  This 34-minute introduces us to the world of Oceanus, an undersea habitat/research facility, and a married pair of scientists about to embark on an historic experiment.  Then, global disaster strikes.

Very well-acted, with amazing special effects and an amazing story, you owe it to yourself to check out Oceanus: Act One today!",1453593600,,443,5.211267605633803

7316217,5,B010RGVMYO,"I cannot remember where or when I first heard about this pilot but I brought it on Vimeo. I was not surprised at the length, I knew what I was getting: a 35 minute pilot which introduces us to the 2 hour motion picture coming in 2016.  I absolutely love it! I have no problems handing over a few bucks: this is an independent movie, (short movie) and I am happy to support the creators. And it's brilliant. No big studio, no big bucks, and a lot better and more interesting than most of the big, boring, big screen movies I have seen in the last six months (including the last Star Wars clone).

The characters are believable, I hope we'll see what happens to Erin and Sam in the full length film. The design is very good, the story is engaging, (am a sucker for end-of-the-world-movies) the ''end'' is scary, you don't see much, but it keeps me thinking. The science is plausible, the story was created with input from NASA science advisors.",1453507200,,942,4.408045977011494

7316220,2,B010RGVMYO,"II'll admit it, I'm a sucker for end of the world flics- and this has the potential to be a decent attempt but it's crippled by lightweight CGI. How is it that the whales are still around when the atmosphere has become superheated and toxic? Did they suddenly grow gills? The acting is just OK and the script marginal. I want to like this film, and perhaps when it really is a film instead of an overpriced pay per view preview, I will like it. I doubt very much I'll be willing to pay again to see it.",1451779200,,502,4.13265306122449

7316222,5,B010RGVMYO,"A great start to the next great saga, Act One kicks it all off in grand style. Showing you just enough of the future to peak your interest, Act One lays the character foundations for a rich operatic story of future survival in a world set alight. Oceanus is the fresh idea us sci-fi fans have been waiting for made all the better to have been birthed by an up and coming new production company. Keep them on your radar, they are on the way up.",1450224000,,443,4.162790697674419
7316223,4,B010RGVMYO,Great concept. This has the beginnings of a great syfy series which I don't believe Amazon has done yet. Also excellent special effects and the synergy between the actors was wonderful. Amazon you should get this viewed on say SyFy channel for a heat check.

7316228,5,B010RGVMYO,"Very nicely done, graphics are excellent, acting is very good, good story line.

7316229,1,B010RGVMYO,"I feel jipped. This ""act one"" was listed under MOVIES, not television. So I expected a sci-fi B movie for $1.99, not a 35 minute pilot of something that will never have another episode available. I wasn't looking for Seaquest. And being a Prime member, I feel ripped-off. Thanks Amazon.",1446940800,6,286,4.74
7316230,5,B010RGVMYO,"I was surprised by this one. They managed to hook you in and care about the characters in 30 minutes. That's far less time than a normal television episode can usually do in an hour. The special effects, sets and costumes are very well done for such a small budget indie type production. I really look forward to seeing the next act and whatever full length feature they are creating for Oceanus. It's a great environment to create a survival story within and looks so beautiful (Rivals any well done space station look for sci-fi)  I wish we had underwater facilities like that. I wish them luck on this project and will be watching for more!",1446940800,,643,4.543103448275862
7316231,5,B010RGVMYO,"Character-driven, thoughtful, and visually impactful, this first act of Oceanus promises to be an engaging full production. The music, acting, and special effects are all top-notch and artfully done. The story is told primarily through the interaction of the lead characters immersed in a sleek  technologically believable, undersea vessel. Solid relatable characters, whose performances stand up- even in the quiet moments between the dialog. A strong contrast to a lot of modern syfy that believes the only way the audience can understand is with gun play and over-specific exposition. The arc of the intriguing story ranges from the interpersonal, to one of potential global impact, and indeed leaves you wanting to know more. Well done. I can't wait to see the next act.",1445904000,2,774,5.2926829268292686
7316232,5,B010RGVMYO,"Oceanus Act One is so refreshing! ORIGINAL sci-fi with ambitious world-building and relatable characters. Usually we have to settle for one of those three, two at best. And this is proper sci-fi: no sexy space ninjas, no reheated superhero fantasies, no empty spectacle. Oceanus falls somewhere between The Martian and Star Trek: The Next Generation. I loved it.

Yes, it is only the first act, the setup of a larger story. But it's a doozy of a setup and I can't wait to see the rest.

So why release part of a movie? Well, world-building is expensive as heck, and major studios won't invest in an unknown franchise unless your last name is Cameron-Nolan-Wachowski, so this is necessarily an indie effort. (It's true that Oceanus doesn't quite look like $200M, but I must say it looks AMAZING for indie.) I expect the producers released Act One as a way to test demand, build buzz, and attract additional investment.

But why should you buy part one of a movie? Because it's an entertaining thirty-five minutes. The acting is good - Bruce Davison is particularly good; it's an interesting world - the future, underwater; and it introduces a humdinger of a problem - which I won't spoil. And did I mention it looks great? Yeah, it costs a buck more than a TV episode around the same length. Movies like this are difficult to get made; if paying that extra buck increases the likelihood of getting more Oceanus down the road, have it.",1445731200,,1433,4.701195219123506
7316233,5,B010RGVMYO,"I am giving this 5 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not purchase it from Amazon, but I do own it on Vimeo. Knowing that this is Act 1 of a series and being familiar with some of the material going in, I can understand the concerns of those expecting a full length feature film, but as a short film, this production does pique my interest in new sci-fi. I believe the claims of bringing good sci-fi to the masses is a noble quest for Future Dude and the projects they are working on. As for the movie itself, we haven't had a lot in the way of oceanic adventures since SeaQuest. I found this very refreshing. I am a sucker for space films and futuristic technology so being in the abyss of the ocean which is largely unexplored on Earth, I couldn't wait to see this. I felt that the environment and atmosphere portrayed here is familiar but futuristic. It can stand the test of time and still be futuristic in years to come. There aren't many gadgets that will become obsolete or old looking in a few years. The story in itself will serve as a good introduction to the main film yet to come. I give this a solid 5 stars because I was captivated, enjoyed the story, and I wanted to learn more. I hope that the main acts, once available come very soon.

The acting was really good. The CGI is wonderful. The premise of the story took a second watch for me to get into, but I started to really connect with the characters in their actions throughout the film. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but please go into this with an open mind and the premise that you are watching an episode of a series and not necessarily a full movie.",1445731200,2,1641,4.242811501597444
7316234,5,B010RGVMYO,"Stunningly beautiful, intriguing story, that leaves you wanting more. I have no idea how people can complain about the price, it's art. I would happily have paid more.

Oceanus is it. Sadly only the first act exists as of yet, but it brings proper science fiction back on track. The whole feature film will be coming out in 2016.

No spoilers from me. You've got to watch it for yourself. Interesting story. Awesome production design. Great actors. I want more, more, more.",1445558400,,403,4.4324324324324325

7316239,5,B010RGVMYO,"This is a fantastic sci-fi short movie. Beautifully executed. Excellent actors. Great story.

Yeah I know it's frustrating that it's short, but it's pretty fantastic for how long it is. They've created a pretty believable undersea world, characters you care about, and actors who don't just phone it in. It's SO MUCH BETTER than a lot of indie movies out there. Hell it's better than some of the movies I've seen in theaters this year. So when the final, full length movie comes out, you can bet I'll be there. This is really good though, and definitely worth a rent at least, especially if you're a sci-fi junky.",1445558400,,613,4.675925925925926

That said, it is an excellent film, with an all-star cast and a compelling story.  It has a feel of a mix of a number of genre shows, from Seaquest DSV to Star Trek and classic submarine films.  I'm waiting with bated breath for the next installment.",1445558400,,511,4.336842105263158

8723023,1,B010RGVMYO,"This was a huge disappointment. The preview was promising, so I decided to purchase the ""movie"". ""Movie"" is in quotes because this was only 34 minutes long, & in that time only managed to make me very upset that I spent $9.99 on a 34 minute 'sleeper'. I'm usually very hard to displease, but this time I truly felt 'betrayed'. There seemed to be no plot...the story went no where. It started abruptly, and it ended abruptly. You are left feeling irritated that you have lost time that you will never get back again.

SPOILER ALERT:
For whatever reason part of the world's population lives under the ocean, (we know that it's only PART, as we find out a few minutes into the picture). We start with a husband & wife oceanologist team that are going to do some research to place an underwater 'pod' that will allow them to study the language of whales.

The reach the destination to place the 'pod', try to dock with it and when there is a problem, the husband goes into the entry hatch of the pod to repair the issue, (which requires the wife to take the submersible away from the pod until repairs are done). As she is waiting for him to complete repairs, there are suddenly huge explosions of fire erupting all around her. Her submersible is hit and she is knocked unconscious. She awakens a few minutes later.

She can't reach her husband, so she moves around to see if she can find him. When she see 'something' starting to emerge in all the debris, she moves closer. When she gets close enough she sees that it is a HUGE airliner that had crashed into the ocean, (it had been torn in half by something). This is how we know there are still part of the population living above the ocean. She decides to take the submersible to the top of the water to see what she can see. She sees the sky on fire and fire balls of all sizes falling from the sky. She barely makes it back under water before being hit by another huge fire ball.

Back under the water, she finally makes contact with 'Base camp'. They tell her that they have been damaged severely, and ask what she knows. She tells them. They don't understand what happened to the sky. (Neither do we). She has about 45% oxygen left but is adamant about finding her husband. Still not sure how and trying to figure out what to do, she suddenly hears whale calls over the radio. They are the calls she was going use to ""talk"" to the whales when they got to the pod. Suddenly several huge whales go by the submersible. She follows them. More and more gather to where the sounds are originating......THE POD!

She gets on the radio and calls for her husband. Yes, he's there. But the pod's on fire, he's inhaling smoke, and he has very little oxygen. So she manages to get the auto docking system to dock with the damaged pod, gets her husband out, and with adjustments to various things in the submersible which will enable them to have just enough oxygen to get back to base, they start to head back. What will they do now? What has happened?",1532908800,,2994,4.377697841726619

8723025,1,B010RGVMYO,Just on the score alone I will not watch this movie. Who ever pick the theme song should be fired never work in Hollywood again,1532217600,,127,4.12

8723027,1,B010RGVMYO,"Good start to a movie would have given 5 stars but, NOT worth $20.00 for a 30 minute short film. I can only give 1 star for the price vs time.",1519084800,2,142,3.6129032258064515

8723029,2,B010RGVMYO,I paid $2.95 for viewing a 30 minute trailer. Do not waste your money. It would be a great FULL FILM.,1516665600,,101,3.857142857142857
8723030,4,B010RGVMYO,"Really loved the plot line, great CGI affects..BUT I feel TOTALLY ripped off as to the rental! As an Amazon Prime member I paid $2.99 renting this under MOVIES & it was more like a tv show 1st episode/SHORT to hook you w/no ending?! Total cliff hanger! (I do however see that there's a new ""Oceanus"" movie in post production now set to be released in 2018, so that'll at least give some conclusion)..but had I known this was actually a ""SHORT"" I wouldn't have wasted that much $ or waited til it was free(included w/Prime membership). Grrrr. Very frustrated & disappointed. Don't waste your time or money til the other movie is available is my advice. (Honestly anyone in my shoes should get a damn refund!) Cmon now Amazon!
