7904667,4,B000006QI1,"A and E's documentary on the life of F. Scott Fitzgerald is informative and a valuable resource for an introduction to the author or his works. This biography not only gives insight into Fitzgerald's life, but also gives some background into what was the roaring 20s. The documentary delves into Fitzgerald's early years, as young Fitzgerald wanted to make something of himself after seeing his father struggle after losing his job.  Francis was able to use his gifted ability as a writer to gain acceptance as an outsider in school, and then progress into his work as an author. He met up with his ""golden girl"", Zelda, and, after they married, their lives became the symbol of the time period.
.
Many of Fitzgerald's novels are chronicled,  and it is interesting  how many characters and events within these novels were based upon the author's life.  It captures the many setbacks that Fitzgerald faced during the years with Zelda, who battled with schizophrenia a good deal of their marriage, and eventually how Zelda spent her remaining years in an asylum. This documentary evidences how both Fitzgerald and Zelda influenced the Jazz Era with their extravagant lifestyle and life of excess. It gives a brief account of the Lost Generation, and the friendship and rivalry Fitzgerald experienced with Hemingway. One unique element that Fitzgerald possessed was his perfectionist-like nature, as he spent painstaking amounts of time editing and revising draft after draft of his works. Although Fitzgerald's writing fizzled out shortly after his death in 1940 from a massive heart attack, it reemerged in the 50s and 60s and he became the icon he is today.

This is a great synopsis of Fitzgerald's life, and while it focuses much on the negative aspects of his life such as drinking and reckless behavior, ultimately it gives great insight into the genius of the author as a craftsman. One word of caution for instructors who are reading The Great Gatsby, however. There is a short summary of The Great Gatsby, and a spoiler is included for the ending. You may want to skip over this brief part, which is about 2 minutes,  if you are reading this novel.

Over all, this is well worth your time. Recommended!",1241740800,3,2209,4.906166219839142
7904668,5,B000006QI1,"F. Scott Fitzgerald defined a generation.  His extravagant lifestyle and unsurpassed talent as a writer made him one of the twentieth centuries most intriguing figures.  Yet underneath the glitzy persona lie a vulnerable man with a frail ego and a tendency toward self-destruction.  A & E Biographies takes a candid look at this multi-faceted man in the well-researched video presentation of F. Scott Fitzgerald:  The Great American Dreamer.
Beginning with a history on the roaring twenties, the prime time of Fitzgerald's life and work, this documentary span the era that influenced the man and gives a detailed account of the man who symbolized youth in a time of decadence.  Fitzgerald's love of writing, love of liquor, and tumultuous marriage to his beautiful wife Zelda are all thoroughly covered in this 50-minute video.  Rare photographs, film clips, and interviews with confidantes, family members, and other literary greats such as Joseph Heller, help to bring to life the story behind F. Scott Fitzgerald. Any fan of his won't be disappointed, and any student, who is required to read his work, will find special meaning behind the words after watching this biography.  My highest recommendation.",996364800,16,1207,5.255208333333333
7904669,5,B000006QI1,"I usually show this video before or during my unit on The Great Gatsby; doing so makes the time period of the '20s come a little more alive and the type of characters Fitzgerald writes about a little more understandable and believeable.  Especially strong is the characterization of Zelda -- it's easier to teach the ""Fitzgerald heroine"" concept after they've seen the type of woman to whom Fitzgerald was attracted.  An added plus is Edward Herrmann (Klipspringer in the Redford/Farrow video) and his commentary, as well as commentary by Scott and Zelda's granddaughter.",979776000,20,571,5.129032258064516
