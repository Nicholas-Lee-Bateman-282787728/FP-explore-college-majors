1448739,5,B00005JL8Z,"WOW!  That is just about all I can say about that.  Wonderful movie.  Great plot, great hero, great sidekick, and definetely, great clothes.
Let me set some of this movie up for you.  Jackie Chan is a taxi cab driver, whose special abilities involve some pretty awesome driving techniques.  One day he gets a woman in his cab that wants him to get across town before she puts on her makeup.  Once he drops her off at her destination, he gets offered to drive around this man, who is a secret agent.  Blah Blah Blah.....eventually he gets to put on this tuxedo, and he becomes this singing, dancing, karate kicking tough guy, whom we have all come to love from his previous films.
I wasn't expecting too much from this movie, but I definetly was suprised.  Jennifer Love Hewit....OMG...wow.  Great Job at being the slightly younger...slightly sexier...slightly ""slower"" side kick, that makes her presence in this movie very well.  Eat your heart out Robin..there is a new kick butt side kick in town.",1033430400,,999,4.722543352601156
1448740,3,B00005JL8Z,"The Tuxedo is a movie with an identity crisis -- it can't decide whether it wants to be a vintage Jackie Chan movie, Men in Black, The Matrix, or Austin Powers.

As befitting its schizophrenic nature, the movie opens with an incredibly silly sight gag that has nothing to do with the film, but then proceeds to two promising sequences -- the visually striking title sequence, which takes place in a bottled-water factory, and the entrance of Chan's character ""Jimmy Tong"".  The first seems to suggest director Kevin Donovan is a director of commercials and music videos; the second shows much promise in casting Chan in the role of a New York City cab driver with a frat-boy facade (check out his hilarious T-shirt).  Unfortunately this scene, as with the rest of the Tuxedo, foregoes any semblance of story and character development in favour of slapstick sight gags.  I'm as big a fan of a good sight gag as anybody, but the best Jackie Chan gags always blend elements of pathos, humanity and character into the fast-paced visual jokes.  Donovan, unfortunately, doesn't seem to have any idea of how to let the humour help him tell the story, and the shallow, nonsensical script doesn't help.  For example, Jimmy Tong's Jamaican friend disappears after the first scene; the coming together of the two plot strands (bottled water vs. Jimmy's gig as a driver) makes no sense at all; there is practically no build-up to the introduction and complication of the character Clark Devlin; and the whole concept of the bottled-water conspiracy is completely unbelievable.

Much credit to Chan, then, for making the movie work.  He is always fun to watch, with his constantly entertaining self-deprecation, sense of fun, and agility.  The camera work and editing of The Tuxedo commits a huge sin in capturing Chan-style action, however:  Jackie Chan's whole action choreography is based upon the reality of his movements, surroundings, and hugely imaginative improvisations.  Directors like Brett Ratner (Rush Hour, Rush Hour 2) and Sammo Hung (Mr. Nice Guy) wisely pull the camera back so we can see Chan really doing his moves -- the indispensable ""wow"" factor of Chan's movies.  Donovan, on the other hand, chops the action sequences up into blurs of cuts and angles, thus violating the reality of the fabled Chan stunts and neatly destroying the very concept of Chan choreography.  As a result, the action sequences in The Tuxedo look like they could've been done by other Hollywood stars and stuntmen, and Donovan's addiction to camera and editing trickery is to blame.

On the character front, I wish they could have taken the lovable crudity of the Jimmy Tong character (as in the first scene) much, much farther.  After the first 10 minutes of the film, the character reverts to a much more prototypical action-comedy character that could've used much more attention to detail.  But Jennifer Love Hewitt makes for a terrific foil for Chan.  Though some of her attempts at over-the-top physical comedy come off as very forced, her character Del Blaine is an extremely entertaining one when she engages in neurotic, mile-a-minute verbal tirades.  At this point, the contrast between Chan's gallant but stilted English and Hewitt's rat-a-tat delivery is priceless.  As it is, because of Hewitt's ragged handling of the physical comedy, Chan's chemistry with her isn't as good as with Zhang Ziyi and Rosalyn Sanchez in Rush Hour 2, but it's a smart and promising direction for a Chan film heroine.

Did I have fun watching The Tuxedo?  Yes.  If you can look beyond the incomprehensible storytelling, complete lack of logic, the totally colourless villains (a miserable failure on Donovan's part, both in casting and in direction), the unnecessary special effects, and the disjointed stylistic conceits, you'll find quite a few good sight gags and verbal sparrings in here.  I just can't help thinking that the promising Chan-Hewitt pairing deserved a much better vehicle.",1033344000,3,3967,5.041347626339969
1448741,1,B00005JL8Z,"The stunts were not interesting, the women all portrayed either as sluts or neurotic, excessive and inappropraite references to sex, lame story, dark and unhappy scenery, all add to a very bad movie. This is a most certainly not a family movie and that is shame.",1033171200,2,262,4.717391304347826
1448742,3,B00005JL8Z,"Jackie Chan makes entertaining movies. This one is all that. He also shows off amazing martial arts. This one has amazing special effects.
It's a three star effort. Deduct one because too much of the action relies on computer effects and to little on Chan's acrobatics, and the foes he faces couldn't slow down a grandma. Deduct one more star for poor production and attention to detail, unless, of course, you enjoy watching microphones dangling in the top of the shots in mulitple scenes - I counted five different scenes, but I only watched it once and was not really looking for them. Cinematographer and editor need to keep their day jobs at Mickey D's.
But if you like Jackie Chan movies you will get some good laughs from this one. And as always, the outtakes were a scream.",1033171200,,781,4.625899280575539
1448743,2,B00005JL8Z,"I'm a huge Jackie Chan fan, and I've always been saddened by the fact that, while some of his American films have been VERY entertaining, none have really captured his true essence, or conveyed the tremendous action sequences seen in his Hong Kong films. The Tuxedo is a HUGE step backwards...
  Jackie and co-star Jennifer Love Hewitt are charming and cute, but the dopey plot (about an evil bottled-water tycoon!) is horrifically bad, and the few fight scenes are too brief, plus the wire-work Jackie does stands out like a sore thumb. I guess I just couldn't get past the idea of a Tuxedo that can do anything...It seemed like Inspector Gadget. And the idea of a romance between Chan and Hewitt is just creepy....
  I still love Jackie, and will continue to flock to his films, but The Tuxedo was a BIG letdown. Better luck next time, Jackie! And please- NO SEQUEL!",1033171200,2,868,4.65359477124183
1448744,4,B00005JL8Z,"This is a great movie.  It's definately one of, if not his best.  Of course I'm comparing it to his other American movies, not his Hong Kong movies (that just wouldn't be fair).  After seeing the trailers, I could tell that it was either going to great or suck royally.  I mean, come on.  Chan getting his powers from a tuxedo?  But hey, it worked!
The fights could have been better, though.  He used a fair number of wires, which isn't normal for Chan (probably just to show how powerful the suit is).  Also many fans will note the continuing recycling of previous HK stunts.  For example on the top of the tower (the first big fight) the rope around the leg trick was also used by Chan in 1989's ""Miracles"".  This isn't the first time he's done this.  In ""Shanghai Noon"", the throwing of the axes which are caught by the bad guy was done by Chan in 1987's ""Project A II"".  It still works, however it is a little dissapointing that he has to recycle stunts this way.  But since he's done about 36 movies since 1978 (not including all the others with Lo Wei back in the day) I'm extremely impressed that he's still as popular as he is today.
Chan has been changing his style recently (age probably being a major factor).  Less fights, more drama and story.  We might not see a really superb fight movie like ""Police Story"" or ""Drunken Master II"" ever again.  We can always hope.  After ""Highbinders"" in Hong Kong and ""Shanghai Knights"" in America, there's word of ""Armor of God 3"" (""Operation Condor 3"" for you who don't know any better) and the rumored Chan/Jet Li project.
All things considered ""The Tuxedo"" is a wonderful (and funny) movie.  Go see it.  And Chan continues to be the MAN!",1033084800,,1690,4.428571428571429
1448745,3,B00005JL8Z,"Jackie Chan plays Jimmy Tong, a New York cabbie turned chauffeur for secret agent Clark Devlin.  When forces unknown incapacitate Devlin, his mission passes to the unwitting Tong, along with Devlin's tuxedo, a high-tech piece of equipment that turns Tong into a super-spy.  Tong finds himself teamed up with water scientist and neophyte field agent Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt) as the two try to uncover a secret plot to ... well, if I said it here, it wouldn't be secret, would it?
Is it okay to say that I liked this movie a lot, even though it wasn't particularly good?  Certainly fans looking for a Jackie Chan all-out action fest along the lines of a Project A or Police Story will be disappointed.  Jackie gets the chance to show his stuff, but there are only a few fights, and no catch-your-breath spectacular stunts.  This film is more along the lines of Gorgeous or Miracles--although with even less action, I suppose--with comedy and character coming to the forefront.  Fortunately, unlike many American action heroes, Chan has the charm and personality to keep the viewer engaged even when he isn't fighting.  He convincingly conveys the confusion and befuddlement of an everyman caught up in situations bigger than himself.  Ironically, for a movie without a huge amount of action, I was particularly struck by his talent during the action scenes.  His body was doing all the incredible things we're used to seeing Jackie Chan do, but his expressions and body language came across perfectly as a man who has lost control of his body.
This is the first time I've seen Jennifer Love Hewitt playing an adult, and while she seemed young, she didn't seem high-school young.  She did come across as the sort of character she played: a young scientist, probably just out of school, trying to prove herself in a new situation.  She managed to keep her character's snappy, bitchy lines funny, rather than coming across too much like a stereotypical hard-edged tough grrl.  In short, she felt human.  (It is a shame that she didn't get more action sequences herself.)  Her character didn't receive too much depth or development, but that's a criticism I have for this movie across the board.  However, for the most part the actors (Hewitt, Chan, Jason Isaacs as Devlin, and Peter Stormare as an evil scientist) make their characters engaging and likeable despite their two-dimensionality.
These sorts of films aren't particularly well-served by overly-complicated plots, and fortunately, this one was fairly straightforward.  For the most part, the comic moments came out of the story, although one sequence--Jimmy is forced to fill in for Godfather of Soul James Brown--feels shoehorned in.  Unfortunately, while the secret plot is appropriately over-the-top for a film about a super-powered tuxedo, it's played a little too straight.  Ritchie Coster, as the villainous mastermind Dietrich Banning, is too dull and straight, and it's almost like he's in a different movie.  Director Kevin Donovan might have been better off bringing a more surreal touch to the whole thing, like the Spy Kids movies, where the weirder or wackier elements feel more comfortable because they fit into the overall tone of the film.  On the other hand, Peter Stormare, as Banning's scientist sidekick, does keep things from becoming too straight.
This is probably the weakest of Chan's American films.  It isn't as mainstream as the Rush Hour movies, and it just plain isn't as good as Shanghai Noon.  But I thought it was fun, and I wouldn't mind seeing these characters again, albeit in a better-written, better-directed movie.",1033084800,5,3616,5.042016806722689
1448746,5,B00005JL8Z,"Don't get me wrong, it's action, but it's really funny too! Chan and Hewitt combine for a great effort!! Isaacs stars as Clarke Develon, everyone knows that Jackie Chan is Jimmy Tong, or should I say, Tong, James Tong! He does that near the end of the film, it was funny! If you want to have some fun one night and see a movie, make sure it's this one! Hewitt and Chan are hilarious! After Clarke Develon gets injured, he commands Jimmy Tong to wear his suit and find this guy who is trying to poison the water. Jimmy meets his partner(Delila, JLH), who thinks he's Clarke Develon! But when she meets him, she knows it's not Clarke Develon. There are some great parts in this movie, some really funny ones too! It's fast-paced entertainment! Hewitt is amazing and is definetely improving as an actress! Her best performance still belongs to Heartbreakers, but she does really good in this too! Chan is one of a kind! This is great, sort of like Rush Hour, but, I think it's better in ways! Hewitt's a better partner for Chan then Tucker, but oh well, good movie, SEE IT!!",1033084800,,1071,4.469387755102041
1448747,3,B00005JL8Z,"Ive seen the trailer for ""The Tuxedo"" a trillion times at the theatre but I still plan to seem him anyway.  Though it would be nice for Jackie to branch out to something else.

This film attempts to make a comedic Bond-like agent out of this well-known martial arts action star.  Sadly, it could have been so much more than a few giggles.  Though there is supposed to be some sort of developing chemistry between Mr. Chan and his leading lady, Jennifer Love Hewitt, I can't be sure when it started or ended or started again.  I will say that the opening scene in the factory with the undercover agent making his discovery and calling it in (and being murdered for his trouble) was pretty cool.  But again, this film did not live up to that scene.  I also enjoyed the plot of the evil water tycoon, played by Ritchie Coster, but again, the follow-up did not impress.

1449176,3,B00005JL8Z,"To me Jackie Chan and Jennifer Love Hewitt are as different as night and day, and so I thought it would be interesting to watch a movie where they played opposite each other.

Chan plays bumbling taxi driver Jimmy Tong (""Tong. James Tong"") who is given the opportunity of a lifetime - to be driver to suave, dapper CSA agent Clark Devlin. When Devlin is seriously injured, Jimmy dons his boss' tuxedo suit - which is so high-tech that the possibilites are endless for the wearer - he can go from mambo dancer to karate fighter in the space of several seconds.

Hewitt plays the part of the very beautiful agent Delilah ""Del"" Blaine whom Devlin was supposed to have been paired up with - its the hapless Jimmy Tong who becomes her partner.

There was too much kicking and fighting than I thought was necessary - but I suppose in a Jackie Chan film there has to be. :) Another reviewer has written something along the lines of they didn't know of such a thing as a bad Jackie Chan movie. That pretty much sums it up. Some of the scenes seemed too drawn out with kicking, punching, stupidity, and silliness - the scene where Jimmy wiggles his behind in a dumb blonde's face seemed to go on forever!

On the other hand, there are some great lines in this movie, and bits where I laughed out loud, but this isn't a film I personally will revisit anytime soon. However, Jennifer, of course, looked stunning, and in a couple of scenes she used her womanly parts to full advantage. Jimmy Tong's character was very funny to watch as he dreamed of the love of his life, a girl who worked in an art gallery who ends up not returning his affections. The ending scene where the whole CSA gang, including Del, launches an operation to help Tong talk to this girl is particularly touching, right along to the closing lines between Del and Jimmy.

If you are a Jackie Chan fan, go ahead and watch The Tuxedo just once, just for laughs. Because it will definitely make you do that!",1380326400,,1964,4.429362880886426

1449242,4,B00005JL8Z,"Off the top of my head I can't remember any other movie in which Jackie Chan's character actually doesn't know any martial arts. In the action comedy, THE TUXEDO, he plays Jimmy Tong, a New York cabbie who's crushing on the girl in the fashion store except that Jimmy's got zero skills in how to sweet talk a woman. Off the top of my head I also can't remember another movie in which Jackie rocks a soul patch (or a Hooters shirt).

Jimmy gets an opportunity to pick up some pointers when he becomes the chauffer to a suave, posh Englishman (Jason Isaacs). And there's even more to this Englishman, Clark Devlin, than a silky knack with the ladies. A bomb detonation renders Clark Devlin comatose. Jimmy soon finds out that his boss is also a dashing international spy. Earlier, when Jimmy wondered about Devlin's oh-so-smooth ways, Devlin offers him this nugget: ""Trust me... 90% of it is clothes."" Clark Devlin had meant that literally.

Jimmy stumbles onto a multi-million-dollar tuxedo wired with experimental micro-circuitry which enables its wearer to perform dazzling feats. Jimmy dons the tuxedo (labeled as a ""Tactital Uniform Experiment"") and he suddenly metamorphoses into the world's most accomplished secret agent. The unfolding circumstances have Jimmy assuming Clark Devlin's identity, just in time for him to get drawn into a mogul mastermind's twisted plan to monopolize the water bottle industry by poisoning the global water supply.

Meanwhile, Jimmy finds himself supervising a beautiful scientist-turned-rookie operative (Jennifer Love Hewitt), never mind that he doesn't know international espionage from jump. Both leads seem to enjoy each other's company. And, in fact, the immediate sense I got from watching Jackie interact with Hewitt is that he's half infatuated with her. Jennifer Love Hewitt, by the way, undertook three months of training to lend believability to her character. She pulls off her action scenes. As ""Delilah Blaine,"" Hewitt's natural bubbliness is tamped down, this characteristic only surfacing in the outtakes. In the outtakes, she can't stop cracking up, most of this good-naturedly at Jackie's expense.

Going by what's revealed in the Making Of the THE TUXEDO documentary, Jackie was nervous about the dance sequences and, in a role reversal, Jennifer Love Hewitt - who received great encouragement from Jackie during her fight scenes - was the one who sort of took Jackie under her wing for his dance routines. One showcase moment features Jackie attempting to perform James Brown's act during a gala function (Jackie had inadvertently knocked out James Brown just as the Godfather of Soul was about to go onstage). Luckily, the tuxedo has a ""Shake Booty"" option. He's introduced as the Last Emperor of Soul.

I think, 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one. I'm giving THE TUXEDO higher marks than THE MEDALLION because his character here clearly doesn't have martial arts training, and it takes the hi-tech tuxedo to turn the simple cabbie into a formidable fighter. In THE MEDALLION the off-kilterness lies in Jackie's character already being this formidable kung-fu expert, so there's this redundancy in the magic medallion's elevating his martial arts skills to supernatural degrees because, even before the medallion, Jackie's character had already been acquitting himself very well. Tuxedo-fu beats out medallion-fu, in terms of story context. THE TUXEDO may not have the intensity and energy and eye-popping real fighting found in Jackie's earlier Hong Kong thrillers, but it's pretty entertaining in its own right because Jackie and Jennifer are both extremely likable and they seem to be having fun. But you may have to excuse the vapid plot line.

The DVD's bonus features ain't remarkable: a blooper reel (consisting predominantly of a giggling Love Hewitt); the HBO documentary ""Tailor Made for Jackie Chan"" which goes into the making of the film; deleted & extended scenes; cast & filmmaker bios; production notes; and the theatrical trailer.",1277078400,4,4002,5.206521739130435

The tuxedo itself is a great gimmick, letting us see a normally graceful Chan become an awkward slave to its many devices.

And in place of the usual humor, there's a darkness and mean-spiritness that detracts from the other thing we expect from Mr. Chan: a good time at the movies.  Less than a minute or so into the film, for example, we're treated to a [...] joke and a fairly graphic (though admittedly creative) murder by drowning.

For parents: There is little of what I would call gratuitous sex. Yes, Jennifer used her charms to distract a bad guy or two. And, the bad guy's girlfriend tried to seduce Jackie Chan. However, I saw little that was truely offensive. There was some violence, as it is an action-adventure. But, the violence was quite tame for such a movie, and they tamed it without reducing the action.

1449338,4,B00005JL8Z,"I really did like the premise to this movie. It's not a movie that should be taken seriously at all, but just viewd for a good time which is what this movie is.

Jimmy Tong(Chan) is a cab driver. He's not exactly happy with where he is at in life. He's a good taxi driver and it ends up helping with a job. He picks up a client who makes a bet with him. He wins the bet only to find out that it was a test. Clark Devilin(Isaacs) a billionaire playboy needs a new driver and the job is his if he wants it.

Devlin is much more than a rich playboy. The fact is that he is one of the worlds top secret agents. He likes Jimmy and tries to make him feel a little better about himself. All secret agents though have enemies and Devlins are after him.

Dietrich Banning(Coster) is one of the world leaders in bottle water. He has a plan to contaminate the world supply of water with only his being safet to drink. Devlin knows of this plan so so Banning tries to kill him. He thinks he does so but Jimmy saves Devlins life only to find out that Devlin isn't who he really claims to be. He tells Jimmy to break the major rule he game and that is to put on his Tuxedo.

The Tuxedo is no normal Tuxedo but a billion fighting machine. With the Tuxedo and the lovely Del Blaine(Hewitt) at his side the two must stop Banning before he ruins the worlds water supply.

The plot behind the movie is kinda lame and the script really is. The movie works though because Jackie Chan makes it. His peformance in the movie is great. I love how Chan can take his martail art skills and make physical comedy out of it and he does to perfection in this role. It's fun watching him pretend like he can't control his actions. The comedic timing is there and he really is funny. It's also great wacthing Jackie dance like James Brown.

The rest of the cast is all right. Jennifer Love Hewitt is in there for eye candy and she is just that. Coster is a lame bad guy, but with what he is given to work with you can't expect much. It's disapointing that Jason Isaacs role couldn't of been bigger so don't expect a whole lot from him either.

Overall this is a fun movie the whole family can enjoy. It's real easy to get cheap and would make a nice additon to anybodies movie collection. Just don't take it to serious.",1094947200,,2286,4.135135135135135

Forget the plot, and forget whatever the story is supposed to be - comedy, action, whatever.  I think most people want to see Jackie Chan use his fighting skills in a movie, not ""rely"" on a Tuxedo to do it for him.
Now, Jennifer Love Hewitt lends nothing to the story.  Her character is beyond trite and common, but we are all used to the female's role being lame.  This premise is too pathetic to give any enjoyment.  I think the major flaw of this movie is that we know Jackie Chan doesn't need the Tuxedo.  We don't see him as a bumbling fool who cannot pull off a roundhouse kick without falling on his behind.  I know this is the major flaw because The Medallion was slight on plot, but still entertaining because watching Jackie Chan is fun.",1089504000,2,911,4.329411764705882

1449373,3,B00005JL8Z,"One of my favorite actors of all time Jackie Chan brings forth another memorable movie entitled ""The Tuxedo"" which while not groundbreaking by any means, is still a lot of fun to watch and more of the eye-popping stunts that Chan pulls off with his movies. The movie itself movie can go off track in several places but the absolutely hilarious  stunts that bring the laughs that Chan has brought forth for so many years are still as fun and hilarious as ever.
 Starring Jackie Chan and Jennifer Love Hewitt, the movie is of a lowly chauffeur named Jimmy Tong who is called to duty on a top secret mission. He is assigned because Devlin (Jason Isaacs), a secret agent who was going after a dangerous international criminal, suffers a serious head injury after an explosion caused by a failed assassination attempt and temporarily retires and Jimmy Tong takes his place. Tong dons on a tuxedo but he discovers that this very tuxedo he is wearing, is laced with state of the art gadgets that give the wearer special fighting abilities.
 Jimmy Tong is assigned on a mission to foil the plans of a corporate madman whose plans are to infect the world's water supplies in order to muster up a massive fortune by forcing the public to buy bottled spring water. Now teaming up with
 The movie is enjoyable to a degree and the laughs are there to keep one watching but there are areas where it really starts to veer off.  The script is weak in several places and Jennifer Love Hewitt's character comes off as rude, and snobby, all the reason she's there is for her character is to just give Tong really bad blood and yell and yell at him, ARRGGHH! It's incredibly annoying!! I can't stand her!! I'm just referring to Hewitt's character in the movie, not Hewitt herself of course. This would've been a much better movie if Tong worked alone on the mission. It's not so much that the script or plot were bad but they both could really have used a lot more development and it all comes off as lukewarm at best.
 The Cameo appearance by the Godfather of Soul James Brown was a really cool idea and the typical action sequences that Jackie Chan has brought us for so many years are so funny to watch (Watch when Tong bashed out a light bulb and caused sparks to fly, SO incredibly funny) but this movie doesn't add much to his legacy.
 This is a halfway decent movie but I feel that they could've done a much better job at it and is one of Chan's weaker movies I've seen from what I can remember. ""The Tuxedo"" is worth a look and worthy of renting but don't expect a whole h.e.l.l. of a lot out of it compared with ""Rumble In The Bronx"", the ""Rush Hour"" movies, or ""Shanghai Knights"" or ""Shanghai Noon"".",1076976000,,2689,4.453252032520325
1449374,2,B00005JL8Z,"I watched this one over the weekend based on a second-hand recommendation that ""this is actually a pretty good movie.""  Not so.  I have seen most of the films Jackie Chan has made over the past ten years or so, and normally I find them to be fun and entertaining.  This one, on the other hand, qualified only marginally in either category.
Jackie plays Jimmy Tong, a humble taxi driver turned chauffeur for the suave Clark Devlin.  Devlin is a ""James Bond"" type of high tech spy equipped with all sorts of amazing gadgetry, not the least of which is a tuxedo which essentially ""takes control"" of the wearer's neurological system to perform all manner of untrained actions, from acrobatics and ballroom dancing to martial arts and rifle marksmanship, with a host of other functions in between.
Devlin's task to is to thwart the maniacal villain (whose name escapes me, but is of no consequence in any event) whose plan is to get filthy rich by cornering the world water market.  He proposes to do this by contaminating all known freshwater reservoirs with a deadly bacteria that causes hyper-dehydration and leaves its victims a dry, brittle shell.  This makes for some rather disturbing death scenes at various points in the movie.  As the head of a major bottled water company, the bad guy and his partners would stand to make megabucks until the problem is cleared up.
Devlin is doing his best to make sure this doesn't come to pass, but is incapacitated in an assassination attempt.  Jimmy Tong (Chan) takes his place (and the tuxedo) to become an impromptu super-spy.  He gets partnered with a rookie female agent, the lovely Del Blaine (how unexpected!).  Together they bungle their way through the mission, with Del making liberal use of her womanly wiles, and somehow, against all odds and the known laws of physics, manage to stop the bad guy.  Along the way, there are plenty of action sequences in the typical Jackie Chan style, replete with humor but frankly leaning a little too much toward slapstick.  Needless to say, Jackie plies his martial arts skills in several scenes, but not with the same eye-catching, how-in-the-world-did-he-do-that effect that he normally manages.
In short, I thought this one was less than riveting, not very suspenseful, with shallow humor and too much predictability.  One of the few redeeming virtues was a cameo appearance by James Brown.  Other than that, though, this film has very little to recommend it.  Not likely to rent this one again soon -- or ever.",1073260800,,2505,4.847417840375587

Jackie Chan has fallen off notches from his usual acting course, since he's now acting in Hollywood.  In fact, as of to date, Jackie Chan is perhaps the worst martial arts actor out now!  Even worse than Steven Seagal!  The plots to his most recent films don't even make much sense at all! (The Medallion, Shanghai Noon/Knights)  Please!  If you're looking for a decent action packed Jackie Chan film, get ""Drunken Master"" (skip the sequel) or any of his movies before ""Rush Hour.""  It's just a sorry sight to see such a great actor fall off this horribly!!",1071014400,2,663,4.7368421052631575
1449378,4,B00005JL8Z,"As he continues to age Jackie Chan has made a solid career choice by moving into films that don't require the type of stunts used in say, Police Story.  Teeming up with a charismatic co-star like Chris Tucker (Rush Hour) or Owen Wilson (Shanghai Noon) has proven that he can be a box office draw in the US.  While still keeping the stunts fresh, having a solid co-star helped relieve some of the burden.  So who thought of Jennifer Love-Hewitt?  Chan and Love-Hewitt have little of the chemistry that the other two pairings had.  They contrast more often than they compliment but the pairings in this film work in another fashion.  There is a scene in the film where the two agents simultaneously try to seduce bottled water tycoon Diedrich Banning (Richie Coster) and his fianc.  They don't jibe well with each other but the chemistry is always between Chan or Love-Hewitt and whoever else is on the screen.  That's why the film works.

The story starts with Jackie Chan as taxi driver Jimmy Tong.  After proving his worth as a chauffeur by driving with reckless disregard for life through Manhattan, CSA agent Debi Mazar hires him to drive around James Bond-type fellow Clark Devlin (Jason Isaacs).  They bond and Devlin assures Chan that he can be as smooth as Devlin.  Chan, being the every-man that he is in essentially all his films, plays down the compliments.  An improbable attack on the two leaves Chan with directions from Devlin to wear his super-power-giving tuxedo.  Chan then is paired with Jennifer Love-Hewitt to avert a diabolical scheme by Banning.  Hijinks ensue.
Chan's character is a fish-out-of-water as usual and as can be expected, his face is very emotive.  Love-Hewitt is a cynical scientist always in the middle of a breast joke.  Both of them either don't get that they're making fun of spy films or get it completely.  The film parodies the spy genre by having an American super-agent with a British accent.  It parodies it's own script ('That passes for humor around here."").  The sophisticated villain is not beholden to aesthetic beauty, art or humor, but bring up bottled water and he is riveted.  It's a film that doesn't take itself seriously and shouldn't.  Whether intentional or not, this film follows the path of Last Action Hero and Scream and provides the most entertaining example of a genre film by parodying it.",1069891200,,2356,4.808457711442786

1449429,2,B00005JL8Z,"When it comes to pure charisma, the only Hong Kong actor who matches with Jackie Chan is Chow Yun-Fat (who is, overall, probably a better actor). What is it about Chan that appeals to so many people? It's not only that he does all his stunts for real, but he seems like a natural, care-free, fun-loving kind of guy. In every film he's been in, you can't help but notice his enthusiasm, even when he's starring in crap.
And thus we segue to The Tuxedo, a sort-of spy spoof which Chan stars as Jimmy Tong, a reckless taxi driver with a crush on a woman working in an art exhibition. Because of his top-notch driving skills, he's hired as Clark Devlin's (Jason Isaacs) personal driver. Devlin is one suave fellow, with a fine tuxedo to boot, but he falls into a coma after an incident involving an explosive.
Tong, as his good friend and employee, feels obligated to find out what happened to his boss so he dresses himself in Devlin's tuxedo, which apparently enables the wearer superhuman ability and agility. Posing as Devlin, Tong partners with a secret agent named Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt) to expose a crime to poison the world's water supply.
For a good twenty or so minutes, the film is actually pretty enjoyable fluff, with a cool car ""chase,"" which is really just Chan driving real fast, but fun to watch, nonetheless. However, once Hewitt is introduced as Chan's partner, the whole thing goes downhill with mindless blather about water. It seems the villain intends to poison the world's water supply so that only his bottled water is safe.
Utter stupidity of the plan aside (poison water, ecosystem...dead, anyone?), it's just not the kind of set-up we want for a Chan flick. This isn't the first film he's posed as a secret agent (see the far superior First Strike or Who am I?) but this time around, it ultimately drags the picture down. For one thing, the film's most interesting character isn't Chan, it's Isaacs' Clark Devlin, who really is a cool and suave individual (Isaac himself has always been a very underrated actor).
Chan is his enthusiastic self as usual, but when it comes to performing nifty stunts, forget it, the stuff here looks too manipulated, which entirely defeats the charm of watching Jackie Chan take on countless opponents. The humor isn't very good, either, with relentlessly predictable jokes (""nice rack"") and an astonishingly digressive segment involving Chan performing like James Brown, which is cringe-worthy, to say the least.
Last, and possibly least, there's Jennifer Love Hewitt, who's a fairly pretty actress and as far as genuine talent goes...well, I've seen much worse (Denise Richards, I'm looking at you). But here, she's just annoying, called on by the script to do nothing but whine and complain. Worse yet, the movie never even opts to give us a good cleavage shot, which might have made the more annoying bits bearable.
As far as story goes, the plot is lame, the villains make zero impression, and the gadgets...well, the tuxedo IS the gadget and it's not a very impressive one, at that. For superior martial arts entertainment, check out First Strike or Who am I?

There is really nothing good about this movie. The action was nothing but special effects, the jokes were cheesey, the photography was horrible, and even the outtakes weren't funny. The only reason I gave it one star is because 0 wasn't availible. Jennifer Love Hewit was probably the most annoying character I've seen in a long time which is too bad because she's a good actress. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that it actually could have been cool if (1) Get a better sidekick, (2) Get a regular Joe instead of one of the best action stars in the world, and (3) get a MUCH better script.

Although the action is bad the movie still works as a comedy and I liked Jackie Chan in it. Jason Issacs (The Patriot) is good as well as the secret agent Clarke Devlin and shows that he wouldn't be a bad choice for the next James Bond.

When seeing this movie at theaters, I was expecting a RUSH HOUR-like film: a film that had good action and good comedy.  But was this film like that, NO IT WASN'T!  This film was horrible!  I will admit that this movie does have a very good plot (probably one of the best plots ever thought of) but it just wasn't funny and mostly boring.  And let me add that the action is extremely cheesy.  I had waited for this film for a while and I was extremely disappointed.  I used to think there was no such thing as a bad Jackie Chan movie until I saw this.  No offense to Jackie, I'll always be a fan of him no matter what but I seriously didn't know what he was thinking when he agreed to do this. Anyway before I go on, here is the plot.
Jimmy Tong (Chan), a NY city cab driver, gets a high paying job to be the chauffeur of multi billionaire Clark Devlin (Jim Isaacs).  His new job is basically code for Heaven.  Jimmy gets to do a lot of things except there is one tiny thing he is banned from doing- going near Mr. Devlin's Tuxedo.  Also Jimmy really has no idea what Mr. Devlin does for living.  What Devlin does is that he is a super secret agent out to stop a madman (Ritchie Coster) But when an assassination attempt to kill Devlin ends up sending to the ER, Jimmy unwittingly becomes Devlin's replacement in agency when he wears Devlin's Tuxedo.  Now jimmy must team with a very sexy rookie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) into stopping that bad guy who plans to poison the world's water supply in a very smart way in which nobody can find out how he did it.
Anyway I would tell more of the plot but then I'd be blowing the whole movie.  But it wouldn't really matter that much cuz this movie was bad.  Another bad thing in this movie is Jennifer Love Hewitt.  I mean I loved her in I KNOW and I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and a movie called TROJAN WAR but she is really annoying in this film when she tries to be funny.  I guess it's not her fault, it's the writers.  It would have been a little nice if we were given some good action.  All the fights were boring and not very entertaining.  If you do somehow see this movie, don't expect anything like RUSH HOUR.  The cover says, ""Entertaining and Fun"", but believe when I say this movie is so not like that.  In conclusion I give this movie 1 star for it's plot and another for the 1 funny scene.",1061942400,,2527,4.143737166324435

 Jackie Chan playing a cabdriver who was hired as a chauffeur for the Special Agent, investigating some kind of secret plot to poison US water supplies. The Agent was hurt in a car blast and Jackie obtained a possession of his super intelligent tuxedo to finish the investigation.
 The idea was good, but overacting is not as funny as could be. The story is ""sucked out finger"" and sometimes even annoying. The stunts on very mediocre level and any Jackie Chan fan (as I am) will be only disappointed.

1449500,3,B00005JL8Z,"*SYNOPSIS* ~ Jackie Chan plays Jimmy Tong, your average ordinary type of cab driver; though a talented 'speedy' driver, he still has his own problems, including a puppy love crush on a woman he can't even talk to! But things change drastically when a mysterious woman (Debi Mazar) offers him a job he simply cannot refuse. The job: chaffeuring for a Clark Devlin (Jason Isaacs) with whom he isn't allowed to speak to! Fortunately, the two hit off and become good friends. But things of course aren't as they seem. Devlin is almost killed by an assassination attempt, Jimmy Tong is suddenly thrust into the espionage world with the beautiful but quick-tongued Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt) as a partner and the millionaire Diedrich Banning (Ritchie Coster) as the evil nemesis. And of course there's that tuxedo that Devlin tells Tong to wear...
*PLOT* ~ All right, you've heard it all before. Your-average-ordinary-fellow is strangely pulled into a plot to save the world from the clutches of a man-who-plans-to-take-over-the-world-by-some-diabolical-means. And there's the beautiful-yet-acid-tongued-co-agent. You've heard it before? I'd be surprised if you haven't! The hollywood world certainly has used this basic plot numerous times. But the movie isn't all negative. The whole plot surrounding the 'tuxedo' is pretty cool! I mean, think about it! A suit you put on that can practically have you do ANYTHING! Fight, do gymnastics, dance, light a cigarette... you name it, the suit does it for you (think Inspector Gadget)!
*ACTING* ~ Jackie Chan is as always sweet and charming to watch on the screen. The very first scene he appears in where he tries to talk to 'the girl of his dreams' is especially cute. And OF COURSE his fighting always pleases! It's my first time to see Jennifer Love Hewitt in any movie, and I thought she was pretty funny in ""The Tuxedo"". I especially loved her first 'fight' scene, she was simply hilarious! Plus she is equipped with one sassy attitude, she and Jackie Chan were quite a pair; he with his quiet and shy attitude, and she with her let's get the job done type of attitude.
*FIGHTING* ~ If I were to explain my three stars for this movie, here it goes: one star for the charming duo of Jackie Chan and Jennifer Love Hewitt, two stars for all the martial arts. Incredibly cool stuff, stuff you would expect from any Jackie Chan movies. I especially loved the fight with the very long rope while they were spying on Banning. Jackie Chan is quite a marvel since we all know that it's HIM, not the suit, that is actually doing all the fighting. Thumbs up Jackie Chan!
*PG-13 RATING* ~ I can certainly assure you that the film is properly rated PG-13. The language is not too bad though there are some words of profanity sprinkled here and there. A lot less than there were in other Jackie Chan movies (Shanghai Noon, Rush Hour). The violence is also not too bad either, mostly martial arts violence. There were also two scenes which were a bit gross, parents be advised showing younger kids. But most of all, the sexual content was pretty strong. There was especially this one scene which I thought was totally unnecessary I thought, did nothing for the plot. Parents I must urge to watch before seeing with younger children.
*OVERALL* ~ To wrap it up, ""The Tuxedo"" is something you can watch without paying too much attention to plot or detail. Just for pure enjoyment.",1057104000,18,3414,4.807823129251701

Jackie Chan's acting, if it can be called that, is also weak and let's not get into much detail about Jennifer Hewitt's character, this has to be her worst work since she decided she could ""sing"". Her character is of this extremely bitchy agent who won't stop throwing temper tantrums throghout the whole movie.
This movie is only an excuse to pretend than Jackie Chan can act and to show his ""martial art skills"" but, isn't that what ALL his movies are about? I think one is enough!
First it was Steven Seagal, then Jean Claude Van Damme, now Jackie Chan, hopefully Hollywood will soon realize that this kind of movies are ALL the same and that the audience is looking for something better to spend their money on.

1449504,2,B00005JL8Z,"I have been a huge Jackie Chan fan for ages, but it was truly painful watching this one.  I am really beginning to miss the good old days, when Jackie was almost completely unknown in the US, but nonetheless turning out some of the best martial arts/stunt films in the world.  I remember vividly traveling to an art theatre to see the almost-impossible-to-find OPERATION CONDOR in 1991, being stunned to find a really good VHS print of POLICE STORY around the same time, discovering that a friend had a copy of both PROJECT A and POLICE STORY 2, and finding a local Chinese video store with ARMOR OF GOD and THE DRUNKEN MASTER.  At this time, Jackie was simply the best action star in the world, capable of stunts unlike any that had ever been done in the history of film.  He could run up walls, jump off one wall through the transom over another door, jump off cliffs and land on hot air balloons hundreds of feet below, and do things with bicycles and motorcycles that defied the laws of physics.  And all this while displaying the same sense of humor and charm he still possesses.
But, alas, we all age, and as much as I hate to realize it, age is catching up with Jackie Chan.  He is no longer the greatest stuntman in the history of film.  He is no longer capable of stunts that demand to be seen in triple replay just to assure us that what we thought we saw really did happen.
And as someone who has loved Jackie Chan through year after year of utterly inexplicable anonymity in the United States, I am absolutely ecstatic that he has finally gotten the recognition here that he has long deserved.  I am, however, regretful that it is for inferior films like THE TUXEDO and the SHANGAI films and the RUSH HOUR film instead of OPERATION CONDOR, PROJECT A, and the first two POLICE STORY films.  The former films are cute and pleasant enough, but the latter are stunning masterpieces of the genre.
Having seen Jackie at his best, it is hard for me to watch THE TUXEDO.  The plot isn't too bad.  A computerized tuxedo gives the wearer almost superhuman physical abilities.  The trouble today is that much of what Jackie has to do while wearing the tuxedo is assisted by special effects.  Most of Jackie Chan's appeal has always been his ability to do things without stunt doubles or special effects.  A wildly ill cast Jennifer Love Hewitt doesn't help matters.  In fact, there is little to enjoy in the film for the hardcore Jackie Chan fan.  I will add that it was good to see the criminally underutilized Debi Mazar in a second female lead.
In fairness to Jackie, he is nearly fifty years old, and while he isn't capable of the mind-boggling stunts of his youth, he does remain one of the more physically active actors in film.  Still, I miss the good old days.",1052438400,2,2769,4.473161033797217

It has something to do with him teaming up with Jennifer Love Hewitt to stop bad guys from getting these bugs to poison the water that is used for bottled water. ... Jackie Chan is a lot of fun to watch, but to try and understand what he says takes a lot of the fun out of watching the movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt, usually very charming and likeable in her other films, comes across as an angry, unlikeable young woman who seems annoyed thoughout the entire film for no reason.

1449506,2,B00005JL8Z,"Being a huge Jackie Chan fan, it pains me to say that The Tuxedo is probably his worst movie.  And the funny thing is, the premise was pretty cool.  Jackie is a cabbie-turned-chauffeur who is very shy and basically an average guy.  When fate throws him a chance to be a superspy, he dons a top-secret billion dollar tuxedo that gives him the ability to fight, climb up the side of buildings and even dance.
I thought the premise of Jackie being a regular guy who could suddenly become a fighting machine wearing this tuxedo was clever.  Unfortunately, the lame script and jokes really hurt what could have been a pretty fun movie.  Jennifer Love Hewitt's character gave me a headache.  She could fight and then she couldn't and many times howling like an idiot seemed to be her way of acting tough.
The movie doesn't play to Jackie's strengths either.  They may be able to foist hyper quick-cut Hollywood editing on us in action movies, but it's out of place and annoying in a Jackie Chan film.  Even Jackie Chan's weaker movies like Mr. Nice Guy had some nice fighting scenes.  The plot, which is filled with gigantic holes, about water striders infecting reservoir water supplies is just plain silly.  And then the screenwriters seem to write themselves in a corner when lo and behold, another tuxedo magically appears when the original one is stolen.
Even the blooper reel that normally accompanies Jackie Chan's movies, seemed interested in just showing us Jennifer Love Hewitt blowing her lines by laughing hysterically all the time.
On paper this movie sounded like it could have worked, but on almost all levels (bad script, directing, casting AND dialogue) it's a dud.  Even if you're a huge Jackie Chan fan, I'd still suggest leaving The Tuxedo off your list.",1050624000,3,1768,4.7639344262295085

1449527,2,B00005JL8Z,"As a movie fan living in Japan, there are lots of chances to see his films in his Hong-Kong era on TV since the early 80s, and as a consequence; like many of Japanese fans, I became, and am, a Jackies Chan fan.  Now, he is a super-star all over the world, and Spielberg's company Dreamworks approached to him to do a film.  It turned out to be ""The Tuxedo,"" which I must say doesn't deserve his name; rather, the film did a huge damage to it.
First of all, the film is not an action film.  It is a comedy.  That is OK as long as it is funny.  Well, the fact is, it is not funny at all even though Chan is still engaging and likable.  The film's comedy sense is revealed at the opening scene, in which you see a deer standing in a river.  See what happens next: urine going down the river.
And there are a few action scenes which involve the titular super-techno ""Tuxedo,"" which enables anyone who wears it to do any acrobatic deed.  There are many options; you can dance, you can run (as fast as a car) and you can do James Brown  impersonation (and JB appears as himself, which is pretty funny).  But I wanna ask you; Does Jackie need one while we know that he can jump, kick, and even fly by himself?  Do you need obvious CGIs when he can do his own stunts, and still willing to do it?
The supporting cast do not work well.  Half of the reason I went to see the film is Jenniffer Love Hewitt, but her role as Jackie's partner (or the relation with Jackie's) is just confusing and inadequate.  And I really hate myself to say this, but I was irritated by her bumbling character, who constantly shrieks and screams.  She should be more lovely, and actually she was in other films or on TV.  You also see the face of Debi Mazer (who is sorely wasted), and only Jason Issacs can go unscathed, showing his James Bond-like delightfully ""British"" character.
By the way, the whole story is about the secret agent and some cardboard villains who contemplate some secret plans, and I have no complaint against these elements.  It is the way Jackie is used that really is atrocious.  Jackie is not Inspector Gadget, and should never be.  My tip to Hollywood; don't tinker him.  If you want real Jackie, just watch his ""Who Am I?"" first for once, and see my point.",1047600000,2,2254,4.273584905660377

Unfortunately Jackie Chan and his production team have seemingly not grasped this yet and have tried once more to have him play the young naive character who is thrust into glory. Sadly,  his age showed, as did the fact that they worked very hard to cover diminishing physical skills with special effects. Worse still, his innate charm was masked by the erratic pacing of the film and the surprisingly annoying performance of Hewitt.
I hate to say it, I feel this was his worst film ever, surpassing Thunderbolt and those of the Lo Wei low budget era.

1449530,2,B00005JL8Z,"If I remember correctly thats the first line of dialoge in this movie. Hence the 90 minute travesty that follows. Jackie Chan has been trying so hard to make a dent in the American Movie Industry. I know that they will never give him the artistic freedom of his Hong Kong films to truly display a film of Chan callibur. (Although Shanghai Knights though is an exception those chan scenes are right on top with  some of his best films)
So here comes The Tuxedo an interesting Plot that could have been used so much more to chans advantage then disadvantage. In the beginning he's a cab driver with a soul patch (lol) and his friend cab driver is pretty funny. The whole movie shoulda been about those two. Chan becomes a limo driver for a spy,  heck those two had so much chemistry it  shoulda been about those two. After two missed chances for greatness they end up sticking Chan with the ever annoying, untalented, unlikeable, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Why team him up with a character who just yells at him and makes him feel bad? Who wants to see someone stomping on the oh so loveable Jackie Chan? Not me. She was a disaster as a 'side kick' for chan. Only Michelle Yeoh or Zhang Zi Yi are worthy to co-star with Chan as prove in previous films with him. The fight scenes are turned into [junk]because they use some (not all) but some special effects to enhance chan. ENHANCE CHAN? The man is  alreayd a super human. He doesn't need a computer to pull off an incredible stunt or martial arts manuever. Not that this Director had ANY idea  how to film chans fight scenes where we barely saw his full body at any given moment. Jackie needs to direct his own movie, if they can't give you one, make one for yourself Jackie. He has directed some of his best films.
Go see Shanghai Knights though that was really incredible.",1046217600,3,1819,4.434131736526946
1449531,2,B00005JL8Z,"No one could love Jackie Chan more than I do - let's face it, the man is a brilliant comedian, physics-defying kung-fu master, and a genuine sweet guy.  Also a man who is well aware of his own strengths, which has me scratching my head at his choice of The Tuxedo.  (But I'll give him the benefit of the doubt - it couldn't have looked this bad on paper.)
Jackie, of course, is charming as always, but even Jackie can't make a good movie of this abysmal mess.  The idea in itself isn't too bad - it might have even worked, had the writing not been inane and the humor vulgar and completely tasteless.  In the end, it's simply embarrassing to watch.  One can't help but feel that Jackie Chan, in his infinite nice-ness, was taken advantage of.
However, I give it two stars (instead of one) for the following reasons:
1. The unexpected pleasure of seeing Jason Isaacs playing a good guy - too bad his part was so small, and the scenes between Jason and Jackie were extremely limited, as they were the best part of the movie.
2. The blooper reel.  Always a scream - no one does outtakes better than Jackie!  After this gratingly bad movie, it is refreshing to see a reminder of why we fell in love with him in the first place.
3. Jackie's charm and presence, while not enough to make a bad movie good, are not completely wasted.  He has some fine moments.
Bottom line - for die-hard Jackie Chan fans who simply must see his every movie, by all means, rent it, watch it, and get it over with.  For everyone else, you might as well not waste your time.",1046217600,3,1547,4.3068965517241375

1449585,4,B00005JL8Z,"Martial arts action superstar Jackie Chan returns to the big screen in ""The Tuxedo"" alongside the super-hot, 18-36 male demographic attracting, Jennifer Love Hewitt in this ""Alfred turned Batman/James Bond"" type action flick.
THE STORY:
Chan plays Jimmy Tong, an NYC cab driver turned super-spy chauffeur/sidekick.  When Tong's boss, super-spy Clark Devlin, goes down, Tong's ""Alfred"" assumes Devlin's ""Batman"" role and becomes the unlikely hero trying to stop the insidious plot of an eco-terrorist.  Jennifer Love Hewitt co-stars as Chan's partner, new CSA field agent/scientist nerd chick, Del Blaine.
THE COOL STUFF:
Though Chan, self-admittedly, is getting up in age and can't quite pull-off the death-defying stunts he used to, the action in this movie is still enough to make this movie enjoyable though hardcore Chan action fans may be a little disappointed.
With the action not quite as big a focus this movie turns up the notches on the ""story"" element and the ""humor"" element.  The storyline in this film is definitely more developed than a lot of Chan's older flicks imported from Asia (ie - Rumble in the Bronx, First Strike and Mr. Nice Guy).
The pairing of Chan and Love Hewitt (which sounds like as about as unlikely a couple as you could ever get) is really effective and I enjoyed how they managed to play off each other.  They had good chemistry. You ain't seen nothing until you've seen Jennifer Love kicking some bad guy booty (and looking GOOD at the same time).
Tons of special effects (including the now standard ""Matrix"" FX) abound courtesy of Chan's ""Tuxedo"" which is the source of his power.
BEST SCENES:
1. ""The Last Emperor"" of Soul including James Brown cameo
2. The bedroom scene
3. Jennifer Love getting all ""Kung Fu"" on the bad guys. ""Yeah!!!""
THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR
The movie overall is fairly tame with very mild violence but there are a few ""gross out"" scenes courtesy of some bugs and a few particular gross ""death scenes.""  Overall though, there's nothing that should give you nightmares or upset you.
THE VERDICT:
Overall, some long time Chan fans may feel deprived that the action levels not where you've come to expect it but the action levels still acceptable and nothing to sneeze at.  This can safely be chalked up as more ""comedy-action"" than ""action-comedy"" which isn't really a bad thing.
Overall, it's still an enjoyable movie to unwind with the gang or your loved one.

1449586,1,B00005JL8Z,"THE TUXEDO is one of those types of films that has very little substance and little heart. The only thing it had going for it is a Tuxedo that can do almost everything. This seemed like an interesting concept for Jackie Chan (Rush Hour 1 & 2) however it is not something the works well for him. The script is week and the humor is low.
Jennifer Love Hewitt (The Devil And Daniel Webster, The Audrey Hepburn Story) is no help either. She is not believable at all. She teams up with Jackie's character, who is really a cab driver, thinking he is the international secret agent who happens to own a two billion dollar Tuxedo.
The most interesting thing about this movie is what the tuxedo can do. It doesn't give Jackie a chance to show off what he can do best. In fact everything is ""enhanced"" and in some parts - it looks phony.
Directed by Kevin Donovan (His First Film!) this film is even trying to take itself seriously. There are a few funny gags but nothing makes this movie interesting at all.

1449587,1,B00005JL8Z,"""The Tuxedo"" is a comedy of almost unimaginable badness, easily the worst movie Jackie Chan has ever made.  What can one expect from a film whose opening shot is a close-up of a deer urinating in a mountain stream?  Unfortunately, things only go downhill from there.
Chan has made a career out of playing well-meaning schnooks who just happen to be extraordinarily skillful practitioners of martial arts acrobatics.  Chan, thanks to his amazing physical dexterity, deadpan delivery and infectious likeability, has usually been able to rise above his material, which has not always been great but which has, in the past.  I also will not attempt to recap the movie's plotline but will merely note that the story hits new levels of mind-numbing imbecility.  In an attempt to overcome the witless incoherence of the film's screenplay, director Kevin Donovan has his characters running around in a madcap frenzy, yet the movie itself sits lifeless on the screen.  It's appalling to see all that talent and energy expended and wasted on so humorless a trifle.
What can one say about a comedy thriller in which none of the jokes work, none of the plot details make any sense, and none of the secondary characters produce the slightest impression on the work as a whole?  Even more to the point, what can one say about a Jackie Chan film in which even the martial arts scenes lack definition and creativity?  The best one can do in such circumstances is to offer one's condolences to Mr. Chan and his gifted costar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, for having to appear in this travesty, and to wish them all the best in their next film project.",1035590400,4,1627,4.785714285714286
1449588,4,B00005JL8Z,"Action star Jackie Chan has recently expressed an interest in moving away from stunts and kung fu, and more towards dramatic roles. The thinking here is sensible and not unexpected. Chan is a bit past it to continue the jaw-dropping stunts and fights that he's famous for, and has accepted the enevitable fact that retirement must one day come.
Here, Chan gives us a few impressive fights and stunts, but mostly he plays a character part, in keeping with his new career direction.
Taking the place of his injured super-spy boss, Clark Devlin, Chan takes on the bad guys in Devlin's place. Along the way, he hooks up with another agency spy (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who falls in love with him. The bad guys are planning to corner the world's bottled water supply using a very unlikely method, and Chan must use Devlin's impressive super-spy tuxedo to stop them.
Oh, it was dumb, no question about it. But, regardless, I just plain liked it anyway. There was a lot of slapstick, and for some reason, a lot of non-PC humor. Frankly, it was just plain funny.
Probably the best thing here is the Clark Devlin character. Devlin is the perfect Bond-ish agent; suave, sophisticated, irresistable to women, and super-cool. In fact, it makes one long to see actor Jason Issacs play 007 for real in a new Bond film (sorry, Pierce).
While this would be just fine as a renter, I think you should try to catch it in the theater if possible. Dumb or not, it was a fun movie, and it may be interesting for Chan fans to see a sampling of the new direction the actor/stuntman/martial artist is trying to grow in.",1035158400,11,1593,4.5929824561403505

Ever since he started making American films, however, his action has been less exciting/audacious/suicidal (perhaps also because of age) and the plots have never been more ludicrous.  In this film, he's a cab driver that gets recruited to drive for a super-spy.  When the super-spy gets injured, he puts on the suit and inadvertently fills in for him.  The bad guys wants to take over the world by providing the only clean source of drinking water and contaminating the rest.  Ugh!
Jackie Chan is perhaps better known for his unique, slapstick style of martial arts.  However, in this film, Jackie plays Johnny Tong a cab driver who knows no martial arts and would rather hide under cars rather than confront a bully.  It's the Tuxedo that ""gives"" him his special abilities including a Fight Mode which turns him back into regular ...-kicking Jackie (but much tamer).  There were also bunch of Matrix-like scenes which I'm beginning to get tired of.
I have no major complaints on the acting, the casting or even the directing.  I do have major problems with the writers of this movie.  It's not good enough.  This is not a good Jackie Chan film.  It's something I'd like to see Dana Carvey get stuck with.  Now there's your unwitting hero.  But why sully Chan's reputation with such .... ?  Had the writers actually watched Chan's earlier films maybe they would appreciate his true abilities and write accordingly.
Don't focus on the plot.  Just enjoy how much fun Chan and Hewitt have on-screen and leave it at that.

1449591,4,B00005JL8Z,"Jackie Chan is a very cool actor from such movies as the two movies in the Rush Hour seris. Before that he was known for his amazing kung foo abilties from such movies as The Legend of Drunken Master. Now Jackie Chan returns once again in the action comendy adenture The Tuxedo.
To start I just have to admit that the preveiws for the movie were not promising a fun funny action packed movie but a boring stupid predictable movie. I finally agreed to see it only because it did so well in the box office and people seemed to think it was pretty good. I have to admit that I was wrong to judge a movie by it's preveiws as I have done in the past.
This movie was not as funny as Rush Hour was probally because it didn't have a really good comendian. Chris Tucker is always doing funny stuff and Jackie Chan's jokes are usally dry and dull but that is what makes them funny. This movie with Jennifur Love Hewertt didn't really give it the comendy that it should have gotten. The tuxedo gags were fun sometimes and the joke in the hotel room were probally the highlight of the comendy segments but that rules that subplot out.
The action scenes were plntiful. Jackie Chan and his kung foo fighting is always entertaining and even sometimes amusing. In this movie he does not let me down with his ablities to fight and it was fun to watch him battle the bad guys one again. The highlight of the action segments were probally the car scenes in the beginning of the movie.
The movie is about Jimmy Tong who is a taxi cab driver who is known for his hign speed. His driving impresses Steena who is a secret agent. She gired him to be a driver for a secret agent named Clark Devlin. Devlin is a ladies man and owns a tuxedo in which he warns Jimmy never to touch it. Jimmy and Devlin grow a liking to each other and Jimmy is heartbroken who Devlin in hurt after running away from a bomb. Clark gives Jimmy a watch and a name and tells him to ""wear it."" Jimmy puts on the tuxedo and learns that it is a device that it's wearer could do anything from fighting to dancing. Jimmy gets a phone call from rookie secret agent Del who thinks that he is Devlin and they team up to investagate a bunniness man who is trying to corner the world market through the bottled water bunniness using the tuxedo along the way!
Another highlight of the movie was a special cameo apperences by blues singer James Brown. To conclude The Tuxedo was a good movie with good action and good comendy. It's an entertaining movie that I recomend.

Jackie Chan as Jimmy he is a tongue tied cab driver trying to get a girl working in a art gallery to go out with him,  Then he  he becomes the chauffer to a Englishman.  Jackie Chan never lets us down but with this one you also get Jennifer Love Hewitt. My kids are 16, 15, 9 and they all loved this movie.",1502150400,,321,3.876923076923077
