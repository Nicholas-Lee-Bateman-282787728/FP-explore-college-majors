8513049,5,B000GNOFAC,"""Le Chateau de ma Mere"" (My Mother's Castle) continues the autobiographical story of Marcel Pagnol's near-idyllic childhood in Provence in the optimistic years immediately before the First World War. It's a chronological sequel to the first instalment ""La Gloire de mon Pere"" (The Glory of my Father), and although ""Chateau"" stands as a fine piece of cinema in its own right, it's best seen after you have viewed the first film. Both films are superbly directed by Yves Robert.

In this second film, the family arrange to spend every weekend in their idyllic holiday home, returning to Marseilles every Monday evening as Augustine (Marcel's clever and enigmatic mother) manages to fix it through an influential contact for her husband to start his teaching work on Tuesdays instead of Mondays.

At the insistence of an appreciative former student of Marcel's Papa who now has a job as a minor official on the canal, the family are given a key to all the doors along the canal path and so shorten their four-hour walk from the end of the tram line to the country home by half. This is borderline illegal, as the path technically leads through the grounds of various chateaux and so trespasses on private property- a major sub-plot leading to new friendships, much principled and moralistic soul-searching and one bitter encounter which serves to illustrate differing attitudes of generosity and malevolence found in human nature (needless to say, the author of their misfortune eventually gets his come-uppance in a humorous and satisfying denouement).

The rites-of-passage element of the story includes Marcel's obsession with a pretentious and eccentric girl (and her even more pretentious and eccentric parents), which for a time estranges him from his younger brother and his friend-from-the-wilds Lilli - until he sees the error of his ways and returns to the more wholesome values of his own family.

These films are beautiful, rich and life-affirming, spiced with humour. The stunningly beautiful landscape, the intelligent script, the meandering plot-line, the finely observed period details recalling that long-lost age of innocence, the quirks and eccentricities of the main characters (particularly the male adult leads) make for a first-class cinematic experience which lingers long in the memory. Beware you will need a strong emotional constitution watching the final scene. Voiced-over by the now-adult Marcel, it is so heartbreakingly poignant as it reflects on the fleeting nature of human life and the passage of time that it brought tears to the eyes of some in my family - no mean achievement, I can tell you. If you don't yearn to visit the hills of Provence after seeing these films, there's little hope for you!",1288915200,,2734,5.1647855530474045
8513050,5,B000GNOFAC,"A typically French, perfectly produced, evocative, involving, continuation of ""la gloire de mon pere"". Now, as a free Englishman, I must always grumble, but on this occasion my grumble is merely that my enjoyment was slightly reduced, by the Canadian produced copy having no English subtitles. But then, my French should be better by now. I recommend this film: visit Provence once more, at a fraction of the cost of real life.",1192579200,2,427,4.944444444444445
8513051,1,B000GNOFAC,This is one of my favourite films so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. When it arrived I struggled to figure how to turn on subtitles then realised there was none! Checked again on the website but it never indicated that it was french only without subtitles. Strongly recommend this film (also Glorie De Mon Pere) but ensure the version you get comes with subtitles - unless of course you are fluent in french!,1179014400,,415,4.402597402597403
8513052,4,B000GNOFAC,this is a lovely story with a happy ending and a fascinating tale to tell,1154995200,,73,3.933333333333333
