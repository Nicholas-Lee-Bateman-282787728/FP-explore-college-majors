8521929,2,B007U58BJK,"My Heart Beats is a curious movie out of Korea that I found sadly disappointing. It is the tale of a professor who begins a study of porn only to find herself drawn to it with a compulsion that inevitably finds her in front of the camera as well. On a deeper level, it is about a lonely and unhappy person searching for joy and love in a strange place.

The lead actress, played by Yoo Dong-Suk (who died after filming the movie) plays the meek and self-loathing professor with a slow moving style that becomes quickly tiresome. Every move, every glance, every look is a slow movement of her head and a blank expression. She plays her character as if permanently drugged.

The psychological journey she takes to find happiness and/or love through a diversion into the oft-sexually exploitive world of porn is an interesting take on sexuality but it's also fairly simplistic and furthermore, the story really never got going or went anywhere. It's got potential to be admired merely for what it is, but I felt it could've been so much more. It was typical art-house painstakingly slow but there were none of the payoffs (character development, beautiful scenery, and emotional resonance) such films have to have, at least not for me.",1334534400,2,1232,4.725581395348837
