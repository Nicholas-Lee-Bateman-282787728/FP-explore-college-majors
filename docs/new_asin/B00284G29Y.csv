3871853,3,B00284G29Y,"This movie doesnt hit on all levels but c'mon Ive seen worse. Val Kilmer delivers the goods. So does Eric Roberts. The plot was better than most ""direct to dvd"" plots. Hey, I finished the movie...the story held my interest. Ok, its not TOP SECRET, WILLOW, TOP GUN or REAL GENIUS. The 80's are over. Val is just getting started.
I smell a comeback.",1251244800,4,347,4.4375
3871854,1,B00284G29Y,"I was wrong. It never got better. Why Val Kilmer and Eric Roberts would sign on to do this movie is completely beyond me. Actually, why a studio would spend the time trying to make something that looks like a feature film out of that script is beyond me. Seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I should have looked for reviews before I pulled it off the shelf at Blockbuster.",1250294400,22,386,4.301369863013699
3871855,2,B00284G29Y,"Kilmer and Assante do their best with this oddly written thriller. I don't mean odd in a good way.

Zero suspense, poor story-flow, and a laughably bad ending makes me want to one-star the effort. However, Val Kilmer and Armand Assante manage to elevate the production to ""curious"". The victim's introduction scene in the steam room will be your challenge; if you can get past that, you won't be too disappointed by the time you suffer the end - you know the letdown potential is fairly high early on.

There are several ""uncomfortable"" moments which are surely worth something, but there are no shocks for the horror fan, and no neat twists or dialogue for the intellectual thriller crowd.

The soundtrack (Don MacDonald) stood out,  and Grand Rapids natives will be interested to see home on the big screen. Otherwise this is hard to recommend to anyone but a die hard Kilmer or Assante completist.",1249603200,29,900,4.787096774193548
3871856,1,B00284G29Y,"Dont waste your time or your money. I LOVE Val Kilmer and I almost cried at how bad this movie was. The ending, especially, is so stupid.",1249516800,25,137,4.111111111111111
3871857,3,B00284G29Y,"Could be better written for sure, not a lot of gore, though what there is pretty real looking, mostly a mind playing movie. You think it's all in his head then it's not, then you not sure. Pretty well shot,  nice camera work. I'm not a big fan of Val Kilmer but he plays a physo global warming professor quite well. I think some better writing would have lead to some better overall acting but it's still not too bad. I'm probably biased since this was the first movie shot in my Hometown Of Grand Rapids after the Michigan Film incentives passed but it's quite well done for a budget of only $7 mill.  It's nothing like the SAW franchise but that is the best way to describe it, a eco not very gory saw.",1248652800,7,704,4.207407407407407
3871858,1,B00284G29Y,"Let me put it this way...I would rather spend the day at work than watch this movie again. I would rather spend 2 hours in the dentist's chair than watch this movie again..I would rather go have my colon examined...I would rather wait on line at the bank..I would rather shovel snow..I would rather look at ugly baby pictures..I would rather write long winded pointless movie reviews about terrible, contrived, painfully boring movies..",1264032000,11,436,4.986301369863014
3871859,1,B00284G29Y,"Because he has fallen a long way since Batman Forever...

 I don't even know what I just watched. A movie about 6 sweaty people stuck in a sauna yelling and screaming at eachother and rambling about things that made no logical sense...not to mention the joy of all this being captured by a camera man that must of had tourettes syndrome. The screen doesn't even sit still long enough for you even to figure out who's saying what, or what's even happening. It's just yelling and someone dies, then cut to a scene of some overacting cop with a newyork accent interrogating Val Kilmer. I'm not even sure what this film was about... Globalwarming? huh? This movie is confusing as hell to watch and is a complete mind trip. I actually ended up pausing my dvd player to go on a rage punching walls and throwing chairs in a fit that I could have spent the 4.99 to rent this on lottery tickets or beer, or even donated to a charity. Instead I wasted it on whatever this is... I think the real experiment of this movie was to see how much chaos could be created by having people watch it and realize just what a mistake they just made. If that's what the purpose of this film was to be than it has certainly done its job.",1263772800,4,1212,4.31140350877193
3871860,1,B00284G29Y,"I know Kilmer likes offbeat roles, but this one reaches new heights..or depths, as the case may be. His eye twitching and facial contortions vary from ludicrous to absurd. Assante does the best he can with the role. Eric Roberts starts OK, then he too gets carried away with his role. Check this out at your local library before you spend your hard earned money on this piece of junk.",1263427200,2,384,4.5
3871861,1,B00284G29Y,"Just about the worst thing ever. At the end of the film I wished that my, ""lungs would melt and my eyes would cauterize"". That way, I would be assured to never be subjected to something this painfully STUPID again!",1263340800,7,214,4.375
3871862,1,B00284G29Y,"Ok you know a movie is horrible when you keep looking at the clock to see how many minutes are left. It had two good actors Val Kilmer and Eric Roberts so I kept waiting for it to have some redeeming quality. It didn't. It doesn't. Like another viewer said I want my two hours of my life back - it is that bad. The plot - well if you could call it that - moronic and makes no sense. I would tell you what the plot was but I honestly don't know. Something about killing people in a steam room to protest global warming. Unbelievable and gratuitous violence. The whole thing is disjointed and stupid. The acting bizarre and terrible. The ""ending"" topped the rest of the movie which I didn't think was possible in being ridiculous and fittingly nonsensical. I was saying thank god it's over. This may be the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot!",1262131200,8,856,4.225609756097561
3871863,3,B00284G29Y,"A bit boring stuff of semi-naked strangers (actually, does being completely unrelated attend a steam bath of mix genders???) truthfully depicts reality of madness surrounding a modern time natural climate change as the privileged academics did fool commons with threats of ""human- made earth environment disaster"" for mere personal gains.

Not much to watch but some nice bodies struggling for the air.",1259884800,3,402,5.483870967741935
3871864,1,B00284G29Y,"Mental patient Val Kilmer has locked up six people in a steam room for some sort of ""experiment"" and uses them as a hostage to get some article about global warming published in a newspaper. Armand Assante is the police detective who should be trying to find the people and save them but spends most of his time having boring discussions with Kilmer. Meanwhile the people in the steam room (where everything is yellow and blurry and seen from weird camera angles) start realizing they can't get out and for some reason start dying and killing eachother. They also spend a lot of time talking about random stuff.

The script is really strange. Nothing seems to make any sense and whatever plot there is doesn't follow any normal story structure.  And what's with all the never ending slow motion scenes in the steam room? It seems like the director tried to be artsy and just ended up being pretentious and silly.

I didn't expect the movie to be great but I expected to be entertained, but I wasn't. I did laugh a few times but only at how pretentious the movie was. Not recommended to anyone.",1259539200,8,1093,4.566326530612245
3871865,3,B00284G29Y,"It just did not hang together, as is true of so many films.

On the positive side, the photography was sort of artsy, like of the people in bathing suits in the sauna. But most of the film was so poor that it made the artsy flourishes seem pretentious. Too much gratuitous violence and blood. Also on the positive side it was fun to watch an overweight aging Kilmer play an intelligent schizophrenic who was overdue on his meds. I think he overplayed it, but they have to do that in Hollywood films for the mass audience, and looked at that way his acting was fun.

Not one to rave about!",1256256000,5,588,4.288288288288288
3871866,5,B00284G29Y,"Val Kilmer (BATMAN FOREVER), Armand Assante (THE ODYSSEY) and Eric Roberts (THE DARK KNIGHT) star in this bizarre thriller about a deranged scientist who wants to prove a point. I first saw Val Kilmer in the 3rd Batman film; BATMAN FOREVER co starring Tommy Lee Jones (THE CLIENT) and Jim Carrey (ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE). This movie is alright but not as good as BATMAN FOREVER or TOMBSTONE (from what I've heard). The transitions are kind of weird because in the scene with Dr. Jimmy Pettis in the Police car, he is in the back seat but the transition also makes him look like he's in the passenger seat as well. I would have to give this movie a 4.9 out of 5 star rating because it is too weird and has a poor plot.",1253491200,5,721,4.348148148148148

8355789,1,B00284G29Y,"This movie did so well as ""The Chaos Experiment"" they renamed it ""The Steam Experiment"" and re-released it. After the original came out, the state of California reacted to the film and made it illegal for Eric Roberts and Val Kilmer to be in a movie together for the greater good of humanity.

Val Kilmer shows up at a Grand Rapids newspaper and wants his manifesto published on how global warming is going to destroy the world in 2012. He claims he has 6 people held hostage in a steam bath and they are going to die. The police are called in and the movie swaps back and forth between the steam room and the police interrogation, neither of which has enough drama, acting, or clever script to hold my attention. Once Eve Mauro put her top back on, the movie was over for me. Oh yeah, there is a twist at the end which only makes the movie worse, if that is possible.

Doesn't work as a horror, drama, action, or thriller.

F-bomb, nudity, a mouthy Italian, and a cop with a pinkie ring.",1324339200,3,988,4.3297297297297295
8355790,1,B00284G29Y,"Six actors are locked a steam room. This sounds like a good set-up for a joke or a new R. Kelly song but it doesn't make for too good of a movie.

Val Kilmer continues slumming in the ""direct to video"" world along with staples Armand Assante and Eric Roberts. Kilmer plays Jimmy Paris, a nut who shows up at a newspaper office with a wild story of global warming and testing peoples' limits. He spends the rest of the film feasting on scenery with Detective Mancini (Assante). Kilmer narrates a tale of how he locked up a group of people in a steam room under the guise of a dating service. He's like Jig Saw from the Saw movies if Jig was down with Club Med.

Eric Roberts leads the steam room group in killing one another and themselves. The poor group has literally two sentences of motivation with which to work. They play things out like every other ""we're trapped in a confined space"" thriller (Headless Body in a Topless Bar, Cube, etc). The only thing missing is that their antics are being broadcast on the internet--something screenwriter Robert Malkani already did with the 2005 film Dot Kill (produced by The Chaos Experiment's director, Philippe Martinez).

The steam room scenes are cross-cut with the police interrogation, helping to make The Chaos Experiment all the more disjointed. Though beautifully filmed and with plenty of mentions of Detroit (it was shot in Grand Rapids), there's little else going for the film. This experiment has failed.",1292716800,2,1463,4.729411764705882
8355791,1,B00284G29Y,The story reminds me of SAW.  The dialog is poor and the execution even worst.  I watch the movie because I like Val but this movie does nothing for the actor that performed incredibly in Tombstone and the Saint.  Do not watch it is terrible.,1281312000,,242,4.333333333333333

I quickly started getting tired but kept thinking that the movie had to improve or that it had to mean SOMETHING so I stayed awake to find out the answer!! But there was no answer!!!  The ""mystery"" was never solved, and the ending made absolutely no sense.

All I could think of when I finished watching this movie was that I wanted those hours of my life back.  That is such a cliche, but it is actually what popped into my head when ""The End"" appeared on the screen.  Yikes.  Really really bad.

Oh, and I had the first inkling of how bad this movie was going to be when the ridiculously stereotyped Italian guy said, in all seriousness, ""fuhgeddaboutit.""",1264291200,3,720,4.409090909090909
