8427865,3,B004FK5ECK,Love her and the concept. My son loves the puppets and the music.  He enjoyed the video clip of her live concert that was offered on her website better than the DVDs.  I gave it only three stars because the quality of the DVD was poor ---- the voices are not in sync with the mouth movements and the picture quality is grainy.  Looks like it was homemade.,1434153600,,355,4.1911764705882355

8427867,5,B004FK5ECK,"We were first introduced to Sukey on BabyFirst TV. I thought she was a little odd, but my son really liked it. I decided to buy a DVD, and he watches it over and over again.",1388534400,,173,3.8333333333333335
8427868,5,B004FK5ECK,"When first watching Sukey's Circle Volume 3 DVD I noticed it has a 1970's vibe that I adore! All the content throughout the videos are handmade and you can there is a childlike imagination to how it was created.  This makes it easy for young children to understand and absorb.  Most children's shows today have lost a certain magic they used to have because they are over stimulating to the senses.  Sukeys Circle contains incredible songs, animations and puppets.  It is everything a children's show should be.
I am impressed with Sukey Molloy's camera presence.  She is very playful and has a voice that can suck you into her world within seconds.  As an adult viewer I was taken back in time to my childhood years and I couldn't help but smile and giggle watching her.  My favorite video is ""Twinkle Little Star"" a about a curious little star and his great grandfather star.
I definitely recommend anyone with kids go out and buy this DVD.  Sukey Molloy truly understands how to stimulate the minds of little boys and girls. Go out and get it!",1377475200,,1046,4.616216216216216
8427869,5,B004FK5ECK,"This is a must have for families with babies/toddlers.  My children thoroughly enjoy Sukey and her assortment of friends as they sing, dance, and do simple activities.  What I love about this DVD and all of Sukey's shows is that this is not a passive watching experience for your children.  It's interactive as they can sing along with her and copy her movements.  This is quality family programming and a favorite with my children.",1376784000,,432,4.797297297297297
8427870,5,B004FK5ECK,I highly recommend this DVD!  My boys love watching and singing the songs to Sukey's Circle.  It is interactive for the boys and sparks their imagination.,1376697600,,154,4.884615384615385
