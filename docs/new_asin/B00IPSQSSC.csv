8644546,4,B00IPSQSSC,"Dry, funny British comedy of a certain era.  Great to see Julie Christie in the big, bouffant hairdos.  An entertaining hour and a half...I think 'Too Many Crooks' has more laughs, maybe 'Make Mine Mink', too...but then I love Hattie Jacques.  Four caper Stars for this.",1451606400,2,270,4.826086956521739
8644547,5,B00IPSQSSC,"This movie is SO off-the-wall and well done.  The Master-of-Suave is at his best and the sets + photography are great.  I laughed out loud at some of the scenes.  Have never seen anything quite like it.  Ah, '62 and Julie Christie with piles of hair... or faux-hair.  Fun movie.",1428105600,2,278,4.48
8644548,1,B00IPSQSSC,Not at all what I remembered from back in 1962 in a college town theater.  Bad reproduction.  Bad acting.  Bad humor.  I must have been stoned back then to think this was a hilarious movie.  Don't bother.,1420243200,,204,4.405405405405405
8644549,1,B00IPSQSSC,Fun movie with terrific performances but sadly the DVD is not in widescreen. At first I thought maybe it wasn't shot that way but clearly it was.  A shame.,1343692800,,155,4.344827586206897
8644550,4,B00IPSQSSC,"This is a delightful comedy from the ""golden"" period of such films from England.  If you enjoyed ""Lucky Jim,"" and ""I'm Alright, Jack,"" you'll love this jewel.  If only Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers had been in the cast.",1211587200,3,220,4.7631578947368425
