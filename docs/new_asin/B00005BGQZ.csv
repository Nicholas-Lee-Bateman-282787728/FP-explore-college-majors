7937384,5,B00005BGQZ,"If you are into U-Boats, Naval History, or play any of the WWII Submarine Simulator games, this is an absolute must.  Created for Discovery Channel, this 3 part series covers the 3 phases of the UBoat Battle of the Atlantic... with drama and precision!  Vintage footage accompanies commentaries from historians, Destroyer and Merchant boat captains and the precious few surviving UBoat captains (some of who became UBoat book authors) were impactful and enlightning.  Seamen sleeping with clothes in case they were torpedoed!  Rescued survivors.  The interview snippets  with Otto Kretschmer, the most famous of the UBoat captains were priceless.

Best U-Boat documentary available... 5 Stars",1484956800,,692,5.533333333333333

That was glorious Victory Parade of returning home after completion of U-Boat operation.
Grew Beared Captain and crews were greeted by women with Flowers and Military Band.
Soon or Later, They will go out for anather Opertation like Destroying Amweican Cargos

After the U-Boat crossed the Atlantic Ocan,America became vulernabble objects from  New York
to Florida. At that times,US Coast Guards were essntially ,entirely unprepared to Attacking U-Boat.
Without any warnings from US Coast Guard, They were attacked, and sunk to bottom of the sea.
Even Americans entirely out of any knowledge about sailing U-Boats under the sea.

7937386,4,B00005BGQZ,"This is a set of 3 documentaries covering the U-boat's impact in WWII, from beginning to end.  It is well-written, and supplemented with interviews with American, British, and German survivors (and also historians) as well as a good amount of archival footage.  It is really interesting to hear the story from those who were there -- including a number of German U-boat commanders.  The breadth of coverage is good, including both German and Allied tactics (and how these tactics changed during the war), as well as technical advances on both sides.  Coverage also includes developments in the Allies' ability to read the German naval code.  I think the most valuable thing it does is provide the human story without demonizing the German sailors.
DVD quality is generally good to satisfactory.  In short, this is a very informative and comprehensive set of documentaries.  Very highly recommended.",995328000,24,898,5.151724137931034
