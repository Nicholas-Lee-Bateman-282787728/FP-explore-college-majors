7859740,5,6303952658,"""The Treasure of Lost Canyon"" made in 1952 is a surprising little movie gem.
Where has this movie been hiding all this time as I have never seen or heard
of it and I came upon it only by chance.

Don't let the title fool you.  It is not a B-Western as you might imagine but an
extraordinary tale based on a story written by Robert Louis Stevenson
(Treasure Island) which is story telling at its very best.  It is a simple,
intelligent and charming story that is full of human emotions and feelings.

There are fine character performances by all and the cast includes:
William Powell as Homer 'Doc' Brown
Julie Adams as Myra Wade
Charles Drake as Jim Anderson
Rosemary De Camp as Samuella
Tommy Ivo as David

The story which is set near the end of the 1800's, concerns David who is
orphaned at a young age when his father is shot and killed whilst they were
travelling by stage-coach to California.  After his crooked attorney fails to
honour his legal obligations and look after the boy, he continues to plunder his
finances.  David then falls into the hands of a travelling medicine show rascal
and now at 11 years of age he is a trained thief and is beaten mercilessly if he
does not earn sufficient for his keep.  However, the rascal suddenly dies and
this releases young David from his bondage.

David then meets and becomes a firm friend with eccentric 'Doc' Brown, a
seedy frontier saw-bones.  The 'Doc' and his wife reminisce the fact that they
have no children and when 'Doc' meets David he is very impressed by him and
his attitude and he offers to adopt and care for him - an arrangement which
David eagerly agrees to.

Everything is going fine but that is about to change when David and 'Doc'
set out one day to bring back a chest full of treasure that the boy had found
earlier.  Up to that point in time, 'Doc' was virtually pennyless but that did not
bother him and he had constantly said that he had no desire to be rich.
However, when 'Doc' saw the treasure and realized its value, the situation
changed dramatically along with his attitude.

David saw what was happening and did not like what he saw one bit.  His whole
happy world was beginning to crumble and the two people that he adored most
were fast becoming abnoxious to him.  David decided to return the treasure chest
to where he found it and he tossed it into a treacherous waterfall nearby.

'Doc' however, eventually came to his senses and realized that his actions
would achieve nothing but destroy his perfect lifestyle and the love of his
newfound son.  The action scenes where David recovers the treasure were
impressive and well handled and when the treasure was recovered from the
deep, 'Doc' donated the proceeds to his church.

The principal actors William Powell and Tommy Ivo handle their roles most
capably.  William Powell delivers a very believable performance as 'Doc'
whilst Tommy Ivo is perfect as the abandoned boy David.

The movie was filmed in scenic locations in glorious Technicolor and is an ideal
family movie without to-day's nonsense.

 Currently available only in VHS, the print and sound quality are both excellent.",1389916800,,3122,4.617753623188406
7859741,5,6303952658,"A rare item these days - a good family film that does not cast the boy as a hip know-it-all, nor does it try to promote misguided New-Age hogwash.  Based on a Robert Louis Stevenson tale, The Treasure of Lost Canyon tells an easy to follow heartwarming Americana story set near the end of the 1800's.  William Powell, not in his usual wise-cracking role, delivers a very believable performance as a ""good neighbor Sam' type.  Rosemary DeCamp is, as always, delightful and (TV) Tommy Ivo is perfect as the abandoned boy. A much overlooked solid performer, Henry Hull, cast as the villain of the piece does full justice to his role. Although not an earth-shaking drama, The Treasure of Lost Canyon comfortably fills the bill as good family entertainment.",1301011200,2,752,4.813953488372093
