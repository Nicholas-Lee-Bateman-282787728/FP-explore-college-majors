5940231,5,B00ANT85VY,"All I have to say is Liam sets a new standard once again. Don't miss this action-packed film. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. not too long, not too short....just right.",1226793600,22,193,4.105263157894737
5940232,4,B00ANT85VY,"Retired CIA agent, Bryan (Liam Neeson) must call on all of his past job skills when his teenaged daughter (Maggie Grace) and her friend are kidnapped by people traffickers, while on vacation in France.

I really enjoyed ""Taken"". It is a really dumb film with ""violence solves everything"" as its central message (and the incongruously heavy themes of drugs, prostitution and slavery, but lets not dwell on those), but in spite of these things (or perhaps because of them), it was exciting, fast-moving and a really fun movie to watch. Although starting to look a bit on the old side, Neeson does a commendable job as a former spy called back into action and surprisingly he makes this piece of far-fetched fluff seem somewhat believable...somewhat.

The script of ""Taken"" is co-written by Luc Besson, who is among my favourite writers, and although not of the calibre of ""Leon - The Professional"", or even ""Taxi"",  Besson is still a better writer than most action film writers out there and as a results, this film is well worth your time and money.",1223769600,2,1048,4.811111111111111
5940233,5,B00ANT85VY,"If you liked the Bourne movies (especially 2 and 3), then you'll enjoy Taken... I personally found it more involving. In summary, a great and believable action thriller, with a superb performance by Liam Neeson.",1223683200,6,211,5.057142857142857
5940234,5,B00ANT85VY,"This movie took me back to Neeson in the original Darkman movie. Barely controlled murderous anger in a hangdog face.  To find his daughter who has been Taken, Neeson does not back down. Leaving a trail of dead and broken bodies across Paris whether it be cop or criminal.  Non-stop action from start to finish. This one is a keeper.",1221955200,43,333,4.533333333333333

Liam Neeson and his particular set of acting skills is really good as the title character and the cast is terrific.  The content might be a little troubling for kids 12 and under.

Here's a former whatever with super skills killing a dozen or more people,  destroys property, shoots his Paris friend's wife and Flys off to Los Angeles like nothing happened.

Yep. It's a bad world. Sometimes you are forced to fight.
If you have a giggly daughter who thinks that she wants to just travel and have fun in the world, have her watch this film. Then remind her that you do not have the skills this the father portrayed in this film has.
Well written story which makes sense.",1501804800,,437,4.544303797468355
5940300,4,B00ANT85VY,"(4.5 stars) This movie was a bit like watching James Bond destroy the bad guys.  It's over-the-top all around.  An action movie and a violent movie.  But like my title says, it was intense and thrilling.  How Neeson's character got out of France I don't know.  Not after all the damage he caused, and people he killed or injured.  And because it's squeezed into 90 minutes it really packs a punch.  I didn't realize this movie was the first of a trilogy (as of this writing).  I am curious about the other two movies having just watched this one.  I'd give it five stars except that it all seems so unlikely.  Anyhow, this movie is recommended provided you don't mind the over-the-top violence.",1501718400,,694,4.569105691056911

Liam Neeson plays to good effect, a dogged ex-Spook who hunts for the kidnappers of his daughter. Very satisfying fight scenes as well as some solidly acted drama in the meantime. Great premise, framing out ""Human Traffiking"" which DOES happen in the world. Based on the strength of this movie, one would hope that the next movies would yield similar results...

I would then click the stop button on my remote control, and the scenic photos would stop and the film would continue until the next scenic series.  Very weird!!!!",1487462400,,443,4.802631578947368

5940353,2,B00ANT85VY,"***Correction*** - reference to Peter Sagal at the bottom (not Peter Segel)

I love Liam Neeson but this is definitely not his best work.  Well, he did the best he could with what he had to work with. The characters are so shallow and clich that I almost stopped watching it in the middle.  Then at least the action  picked  up, and I was able to make it through the rest of the movie.  Therefore, I gave it two stars instead of one.  Also it really asks you to suspend a lot of disbelief.
Aside  from the usual man pretending to be super hero and defying all odds , he committed multiple crimes on his quest to save his daughter and some of them were against innocent people and there was no mention whatsoever of him taking any responsibility for that.
And if you have any respect for women whatsoever, I don't see how you can appreciate their portrayal in this movie.  The mom is a coldhearted B, the friend is  a flirt who apparently got what she deserved when she ended up dead  and the daughter is a nave, self-centered virgin who draws  over a half million dollars in a bidding war  at the ""prostitute/slave"" auction.  But of course daddy saves her before she loses her purity. Don't waste your money buying a copy. Check it out from the library (like I did).  Peter Sagal got it right when he said it's a fantasy film for divorced dads.  In fact I don't even feel comfortable repeating what he said about the film. Soooo disappointing.",1485216000,,1443,4.388679245283019

5940415,1,B00ANT85VY,"He should be.

Taken is one of the most morally bankrupt films ever made for mainstream American audiences. The ""hero"" at it's center is constantly making repulsive choices. Or rather doing nothing when the right thing would be pretty damn easy. Time after time he breezes right by dozens of girls who are living the life of a sex slave, the awful fate he wants to save his daughter from.

After killing a bunch of bad guys at a construction site, Neeson just drives off. Doesn't try to rescue any of the girls being held there. No offer to drive anyone to a police station. Won't even offer them a few bucks for the bus.

At one point Neeson finds the body of his daughter's best friend. Does he make any attempt to send her back to her parents? Of course not. In the sick morality of this film, the best friend deserved to die because how dare she want to go the Europe? How dare she want to talk to European boys?

At the climax, a creepy sheik has the daughter and two other girls on his yacht. Neeson bursts in, kills the baddies and daddy and daughter are reunited. What of the other two girls? Who knows. We literally see them for about ten seconds and then never again. Even AFTER Neeson has what he wants, he won't life a finger to help someone else. He doesn't care, nor does the movie. And come to think of it, even the daughter doesn't say a word about helping the other girls.

I know there are people who will defend this by saying, ""It's a dumb action movie,"" ""Check yur brain at the door,"" ""its not sposd to be real lol."" If a plot is going to involve the very real world of sex slavery, there should be some attempt to treat the story and the characters (and the audience) with a shred of plausibility and a modicum of moral consideration.",1475625600,,1756,4.293051359516617

Movies that keep you on the edge of your seat and the absolute best. This does that through the entire movie. It will make you think twice as a parent letting your child travel overseas. If you have not seen this movie you MUST see it. It will not disappoint. They have a Taken 2 and 3 now. They are not as good as the first one, but still definitely worth the watch.

5940502,5,B00ANT85VY,"TAKEN

I know what you are going to say but here it is anyway, thus far I have only watched the first film in this series even though I own all three. After seeing this one again recently on TV I have decided to finally go through all three. So I had to revisit this one in Blu-Ray form.

The story follows an ex CIA operative as he travels to France in order to find and save his daughter. He was on the phone with her when she was Taken and now he is using everything he knows to track her down and hunt down her captors. Human trafficking is something he has dealt with before in his line of work and knows what she could be in for as a sex slave sold on the black market.

This was a really good flick that kinda brought back that old school feel for me. A classic story full of mindless violence but violence with a purpose, it is his daughter after all. This is Liam at his best here as the style of the film fits him perfectly. Writers Luc Besson  and Robert Kamen who both gave us this series along with The Transporter series and films like Kiss of the Dragon and the classic The Fifth Element  wrote a really good story that director Pierre Morel [From Paris with Love] took and ran with. This thus far is my favorite in the series mainly because I have yet to watch the other two, I will fix that very soon.",1462492800,,1318,4.053846153846154

5940504,5,B00ANT85VY,"This movie was so good that I kind of wish that they didn't make a part two, because it could never compare to the original.  And it didn't.  It is probably the fact that I am a father of a daughter that explains why I feel it so much, but Liam Neeson nailed this one",1461974400,,267,3.8363636363636364

5940585,5,B00ANT85VY,"""Taken"" is a film that keeps you glued to the TV the entire time, the pace is so perfect. There were 3 films made (so far) and this first film is the best one. The others are worth seeing but this one is good for repeated viewings.

Liam Neeson plays a man (a former spy) with a ""particular set of skills"" that you don't want to mess with. His daughter is kidnapped while travelling to Paris, France and he sets out to get her back. We are bombarded with these ""former spy"" dark action heros in movies and most of these films have the same thin plots, are made very quickly, rely on lots of effects and just plainly suck! This film works very well. It's mostly hand to hand combat and Neeson is convincing in the role (although by the 3rd film he's starting to look too old).

If you like this film, also check out Neeson in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"", which is similar and very good.",1451433600,,887,4.211764705882353

I don't mind suspending belief in an action movie but having to reduce yourself to such a low level for this one is a bit too much but, then again, who can argue against such believable movies like this and Fast & Furious that spawn so many more of the same. Movies are a matter of taste and this one tasted pretty sour in my opinion.",1449878400,,507,4.237113402061856

5940743,5,B00ANT85VY,"Taken is a movie that has received a huge Cult Following since its release in 2008 and has become one of Liam Neeson's most defining movies of his career and has earned him a reputation as one of the most beloved action movie stars of this generation. The story of Taken revolves around Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), a Former CIA agent who's daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), travels to Paris with a friend but are soon kidnapped by a group of Albanians. Bryan then travels to Paris and uses his set of skills to rescue his daughter before she is gone forever. There are a lot of things about Taken that makes it awesome: Liam Neeson, the story, the drama, the dialogue, and last but not least: the badass action scenes. The action scenes are so fun to sit through and just seeing Neeson's character fight his way through Paris to rescue his daughter is absolutely satisfying. One little flaw that the movie does have is that it is predictable. Other than that, Taken really is a fantastic action movie and if you haven't seen it, you are really missing out.",1435968000,,1051,4.536842105263158

5940758,5,B00ANT85VY,"Taken is a French thriller starring Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen.

Bryan Mills is a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative who sets about tracking down his daughter after she is kidnapped by human traffickers while traveling in France. He sets on a frantic quest to rescue her after the young girl is abducted by slave traders in District B13.

This is film provides a lot of fun and entertainment as a predictable action thriller. It's got all the attributes of a pleasurable action thriller - excitement, some undeniably enjoyable scenes and the absence of what it needs to be more memorable and more substantial. Also,a viewer is introduced to a new side of Liam Neeson, one that is relentless and likes to hit criminals in the throat and he makes this action movie engaging. That is why this is one excellent film despite of being far from a masterpiece.",1434931200,,885,4.815789473684211

When his daughter goes over to Paris, France with her friend Amanda to basically follow a rock band touring, he is very concerned knowing what kind of world we REALLY live in. After being virtually forced to signing a document giving his consent by his estranged wife played by Famke Jannsen, he gets the phone call he has been dreading. Both his daughter and her girlfriend have been kidnapped by Albanian thugs to be sold in the sexual slave trade in foreign 3rd world countries. Little do the Albanians know just what kind of man Bryan Mills IS. They find out one by one in a good movie that sheds light on just exactly what happens to quite a few women going overseas by themselves.

5940844,2,B00ANT85VY,"Oh dear - but this was bad - I am not sure it would have had to be - but the plot is predictable - early on you guess the daughter will get taken, the dad will save her, the bad guys cannot shoot straight and Liam Neeson will prevail against odds of 50:1 - the fact that Neeson passes himself off as a french political aide (speaking English) is probably lost on monolingual audiences, for the rest of us, you just go - hm dead giveaway - the REALLY bad guys are all Arabs and who cannot shoot straight and apparently prefer to buy American girls - oh and Neesons daughter's acting in the movie is abysmal and as she is also not particularly attractive the plot of her being sold off for a lot of money is even less believable (probably because she is American?) - this isn't of course the point, but it would help make the movie more believable.  Loads of shots of women being abused, shots of emaciated women, drugs, and torture scenes, and a lot of illogical action - e.g. if Neeson is at the airport in France and has identified the spotter - why doesn't he trail him, watch the next victim and then catch the bad guys when they show up to abduct her - I guess because that would be the logical thing to do AND because of course then the movie would only take 20 minutes.

5940949,1,B00ANT85VY,"When you take an actor such as Liam Neeson and try to put him in an action movie that tries to portray the evils of human trafficing you just end up with more Hollywood trash.

I liked John Wick because you know that movie was going to be over the top and not apologize for it. Here it seems as though they threw in the drama element about fighting for your family and the universal statement that kid-napping people to make them sex slaves is evil just to give it some viable wait in the plot. But when you put those elements into a very poorly written script that is horribly filmed then you have this movie, Taken.

5941012,4,B00ANT85VY,"""You have to see this movie!""

Those are the words impressed upon me a while back when, during a conversation about favorite films, I told a friend that I hadn't seen Taken yet. After being informed that this was one of the best movies since Braveheart, I was ordered to watch Taken lest I deprive myself of something as vital as air. Now, having seen Taken to see if was worth that hype, I realize I shouldn't have held my breath.

Liam Neeson plays a retired spy on the hunt for his somewhat-estranged teenage daughter who has been abducted in France by sex traffickers, and as I watched I quickly suspected that this was a script originally intended for Harrison Ford. The movie just had that Harrison Ford vibe, you know what I mean? A dutiful father is placed in a life-threatening situation in which he must go to extreme measures to protect his family; it's the kind of movie Ford--let's face it--is known for. But, I guess he was too busy filming that terrible Indiana Jones sequel to bother with this film, and so we get Neeson and his muddled American-ish accent.

There's not really a whole lot to say about the movie. The entire plot is preposterous and requires a fair amount of suspension of disbelief, which I can handle. I just wasn't expecting a movie that was designed less for someone of Liam Neeson's caliber than an action movie scrounged out of Sylvester Stallone's or Bruce Willis' remainder bin. Just think of Taken like this: It's what would happen if Jason Bourne got married, had a kid, then that kid got kidnapped.

It's a fun ninety minutes, don't get me wrong, but when I'm told this is the best movie since Braveheart--and that was a damned good movie, by the way--I expect a little more depth and subtext to the movie. Foolish on my part, I now realize. There are fights, chases, gun fights, more chases, and a couple of nice one-liners for Neeson. Famke Janssen appears early in the film as Neeson's ex-wife, playing the scornful wedge between father and daughter like there's no tomorrow, but her role is one of a precious few given any consideration in terms of character.

Rent it, nuke some popcorn, and enjoy. Just don't set the bar too high because Braveheart this is not.",1421193600,,2211,4.601522842639594

5941015,1,B00ANT85VY,"After the movie, I thought it was okay.  After having had a day to think about it, I realize that it wasn't.  This is typical Hollywood formulaic crap, with characters that aren't developed at all (except for our protagonist) and a plot that's simply a rehash of every other rescue-the-girl-by-killing-every-bad-guy film ever made.  What bothers me the most, though, is the manipulation of the audience--if they can make the bad guys bad enough, then we as an audience aren't disturbed at all by Neeson murdering all of them in cold blood.  In fact, we cheer for him, and we're glad these ""vermin"" are wiped out.  Neeson is decent here, but none of the other actors have roles that challenge them at all, so there's no real other acting here.  And how convenient is it that his daughter's friend is dead when he finds her, so that he doesn't have to do anything to rescue her and possibly complicate the plot?  It's also incredibly convenient that the line holding the pipe that he's handcuffed to is loose, and convenient that terrorists with full automatic weapons are able to miss him at extremely close range. . . . it goes on and on.",1420848000,8,1138,4.6318407960199

5941023,4,B00ANT85VY,"Good movie! It's a unique spin on the action movie genre, which, as we all know, could use a good kick in a new direction. The fast-paced and somewhat realistic choreography on the fight scenes and sense of suspense driven by the intensely real father-daughter relationship made the plot easy and exciting to follow. The sharply written dialogue was of a much better caliber than most big-budget blockbusters, and had me and my old friends quoting it for a good while to come. While it wasn't the next Citizen Kane or anything, it was one of the better movies I've seen in recent years and was exactly what an actor like Liam Neeson deserved.",1420588800,,642,4.640350877192983

It's got the usual super good guy who kills with impunity and a bunch of dumb bad guys to hate. And that's really the problem here. This movie will have you demanding  a major war in the Middle East and demanding that all males need to be castrated. As this ""macho' movie moves toward its climax one gets the uncomfortable feeling that something is wrong. The viewer is being manipulated into the belief that men are evil, women should rule and we need to kill every Arab and conservative  that lives.  This movie is hate propaganda.

He is believable as a skilled father and is strong in character, which in other character roles, he has been limited - either by the director and or the script. Star Wars III was poorly written and directed. In Batman, his role was believable at the beginning; but fell apart at the last. He had strong presence in Taken and Taken II, which I enjoyed both, and have watched several times. A four-star rating for me, does not infer that the movie was inferior. The script just did not hit - for me - the height, that 'Amazing Grace,' or 'Invictus' inspired me. Of course that is my opinion.",1416182400,,616,4.3652173913043475

5941171,4,B00ANT85VY,"THE FILM: TAKEN is a simple action movie about a family man with ""a particular set of skills"" that takes down a sex trafficking ring in order to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped while on holiday in Paris. While this could have gone straight to the bargain bin, what really sells this movie is Liam Neeson, who brings a everyman quality to his role as Bryan Mills. The production values by Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel are also worth noting, with just enough emotional content to make the story relatable and a kinetic style that keeps things moving along at a good pace. Generally speaking everyone gives a decent performance, but I thought that Maggie Grace was miscast as she doesn't look the part of a 17-year-old girl, and her acting is questionable at best. Story-wise, I did appreciate that the movie took time to establish characters and relationships before heading off into more standard action thriller territory but, that being said, it only taps into the basest of human emotions and tendencies. Only someone devoid of empathy wouldn't understand the sticky situation that the characters are put into. Still, despite the rote nature of the setup it works, and the latter two-thirds of the movie rarely let up. As far as the action is concerned, it is well-shot for the most part. Pierre Morel shoots the close quarters combat up close, but the editing isn't so bad that you can't tell who's fighting who, and the geography and shot compositions are decent. If there's one complaint I have in this area is a nighttime car chase which was perhaps a bit too chaotically shot/edited. Overall, this is a decent time-passer that has enough story and thrills to keep you interested, and the running time is only about 90 minutes so it never overstays it's welcome.

THE EXTRAS: There is a decent amount of supplementary material presented here, chief of which are not one, but two commentaries for the extended version of the film. There is also a Black-Ops Field Manual picture-in-picture feature (also for the extended version) that highlights geographical locations and such while the movie is playing. Additionally, there are three featurettes which highlight different aspects of the production. The first of these is an 18-minute production featurette that has interviews with Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace and Pierre Morel. What can be taken from this is that Liam Neeson really enjoyed himself, Maggie Grace enjoyed getting to work with Liam Neeson and the director went into this project with slightly higher ambitions than just making an action film. You also get to see how hands on the director was, given his history as a camera operator and director of photography for Luc Besson (who co-wrote and produced this). After this, there is a 5-minute featurette with premiere footage, and 11 minutes of side-by-side comparisons of several scenes in the film with behind-the-scenes footage of same. Overall, I'd say there is a decent amount of supplementary material that should satisfy fans who go for that sort of thing.

OVERALL: It may not be thought-provoking or engaging on anything but a visceral level, but it's effective at what it sets out to do. Not only that, but cinephiles are rewarded with a handsome set of bonus features. Recommended for action junkies and Liam Neeson fans.",1412899200,,3318,4.944444444444445

5941186,3,B00ANT85VY,"Nearly 2.5 million people are taken against their will every year and sold into the $32 billion sex trade industry. Its unfortunate that none of those people have Bryan Mills as their father. While my own knowledge of human trafficking is limited, it is clear that Taken does a poor job of reifying that topic. The storyline is unconvincing and unrealistic which makes it hard to appreciate what the film is trying to accomplish. The performance of Liam Neeson is the exception, and his acting is what makes the film watchable.
 Ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills, (Liam Neeson) has moved to California to be closer to his high school aged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Kim makes plans to travel to Europe for summer break. Upon arriving in Paris, Kim and her friend Amanda are kidnapped by Albanian gangsters to be sold into the sex trade. Mills travels to Europe to track down Kim with the help of his CIA connections.
 Even though Mills was in the CIA, this film embellishes the power and intelligence of the organization. If this film was even a close representation to what the real CIA is like, the U.S. would never have been involved in a war on terrorism. In Taken, Mills friends in the CIA are able to take a recording of the suspected captor and analyze to find out that the persons name is Marko, a suspected Albanian gangster operating in human trafficking. While Im sure this sort of voice recognition technology exists, it seems all but realistic in that given situation. There is a sequence in the film where Mills has been captured and is about to be executed. He manages to rip the pipe out of the ceiling, from which he is attached, and kill all of the armed men in the room. This provided for a great action scene but not one that had any hint of realism to say the least. These unrealistic elements of the film made it seem much like an action movie instead of a thriller because of the countless number of times that Mills is able to miraculously cheat death.
 Some scenes in the film are so unrealistic that they are actually humorous to watch. The fact that the kidnapping of Kim and Amanda takes place in Paris during broad daylight stood out as one of the most unrealistic scenes in the film. First off, why would anyone choose broad daylight to kidnap someone? How was a small team of criminals able to kidnap Kim and Amanda from their posh Paris penthouse without being seen? And wouldnt people living in the apartment be able to hear the screams of teenage girls? I think if the film had taken a more realistic approach to how these kidnappings occur then that would have made it much more horrifying.
 Thank goodness for Liam Neeson, the saving grace for this film. Neeson played the role as well as he could have given the shortcomings of the script. His signature accent and excellent line delivery gives Mills dimension. The scene where Mills is on the phone with Kims captor was hands down the best scene in the film. The scene is unique to the film; when Mills says,  I will find you, and I will kill you, it sent shivers down my spine. When he speaks he keeps you on the front edge of your chair because the tone in his voice is this weird but excellent combination of monotone and seriousness.
 I do not by any means think that Taken is a bad film but you will not be missing out on anything by giving it a pass next time you decide to sit down and watch a movie. I believe Liam Neeson fans will particularly enjoy this film, as it is another great display of his acting abilities. This film could have been great if it left you with the feeling of thinking that this could actually happen. Regardless of all of the inaccuracies, the film still made me think about the real life horrors of human trafficking.",1411603200,,3733,4.490427098674521

The good guys are (mostly) good, the bad guys, however, are rotten to the core.  I was a little disappointed that the bad guy characters were so uniformly bad (and bland) and very stereotypical. The beginning of the movie was very well done... great portrait of the protagonists in life and a brief introduction to Bryan Mill's ""special set of skills"" left no doubt as to his core competencies. Liam Neeson did as fine a job of acting as the role allowed: subtle nuances here and there, like fatigue and irritability due to fatigue, are shown in a believable fashion (and much to the detriment to some of the antagonists). Bryan's former French Intelligence contact was well-played by Leland Orser. The movie's fast pace blurred some of the weaker scenes (particularly just before the abductions).

The second is that a young woman's virginity is cherished equally by her father and members of the kind of ridiculous ""white slavery"" rings found in 19th-century pulp fiction. The fight scenes are cool, though.

And there are people around the globe just snatching spoiled rich white American girls off the street. Oh, and also, by the logic of this film, you should kill as many people as possible to get YOUR child back, but anyone else's daughter who's chained to a bed and addicted to drugs? Let 'em die. Except that one girl who has an important clue about your little precious. That's not ""heroic,"" it's selfish. I know it's only a movie, but it's kind of embarrassing that ones like this gross billions all over the world and that this is the image of America that's being put out there. Oh, and the scene where he's watching his own daughter get auctioned off to, again, some dastardly brown guys, is cringe-worthy: We're supposed to relate to a doting father trying to get his innocent girl back, and then there she is half naked on a stage with him watching? Ugh. Just creepy. Also, can the guy NEVER  drive the right way on any given street?

Taken (2009) stars Liam Neeson as a former spy who is trying to rescue his naive kidnapped teenage daughter in Paris, France.  Does he succeed?  Watch to find out.

This movie has a lot of fast action and violence.  It's definitely one of the best action thriller movies I've seen.  Neeson kicks total butt in this movie.  He's a man on a mission to find his daughter and he doesn't stop at anything to accomplish his goal.

5941241,3,B00ANT85VY,"It's not international sex trafficking atrocity according to the Japanese and it's never discussed that this aspect exists in the Holocaust and that Germany strongarmed their foreign girlfriends otherwise their families would be sent to work camps.

The Japanese took girls out of their home countries - that's the same thing as what is happening today.  They transported Chinese and Malay girls to Rabaul where they were killed in the tunnels that enslaved Indian POWs were forced to dig.

Can you imagine some disgusting Chinatown gangster named Applehead telling a fourteen year old girl in front of her Chinese father that he can make one phone call and a van will drive up and her family will never see her again?  It's not something you say to a gangster's daughter - it's something you say to a civilian family with no history of violence and no chance at fighting back.  Later, a naked apparently drugged Korean girl danced in the rain outside the father's store and he had someone call the police anonymously but afterwards, the people who would be responsible for obtaining the murder weapon to kill the father told him that she belonged to them and indeed, she was seated next to them in a doorway of a Mott Street building.",1408060800,,1235,4.779342723004695

Enough to say that the line sets the whole movie up and sets it apart from other action stars and their films. I have been a fan of Neeson since ""Darkman,"" wherein he played a very dark anti-hero.

5941280,2,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson has a way of speaking his lines and carrying himself that I like. I don't know where Liam is from but for some reason I like him as an actor. That said, this movie really doesn't offer much. I truly enjoyed the action part of the movie. I love how Neeson's character wasted no time in simply killing scumbags. That is the way I would do it, if I was put in such a situation or that is the way I would want to do it. Sure, in a real world you'd probably simply get killed in your first encounter with such dangerous scumbags. So it's nice to go to fantasy land where one guy can become an army of one. So, I really enjoyed the killing of scum but the rest of the movie was awful.

Neeson's daughter in this movie is that gal who I loathed from the tv show LOST. Now granted, in LOST the actresses's part was supposed to be loathsome. So to that extent the actress played her part well in LOST. But in Taken we are supposed to believe the actress is a teenager, that she is worth saving and so on. I didn't find the character to be worth saving. The girl was living a new life with her wife's new husband. Neeson's character bought the daughter a Karaoke machine while the new sugar daddy bought his new daughter a horse. And the wife was quite loathsome as well. Why would this character who is cast as a loser even care about such people. And there was no chemistry between Neeson's character, his daughter and the ex-wife. The plot is so thin and everything is completely predictable. I never was at a loss for anything. Everything was laid out like a 200 thread count sheet. The plot was weak, weak, weak. The family was weak, weak, weak. It was just so obvious that the director was throwing up a family so they could get to the action scenes which were fun. And I don't know but perhaps Neeson is also to blame for the family stuff not working. Maybe a more accomplished actor could have made the family more believable but I didn't believe this so called family, or ex family for one minute. To me the family was just stage and prop. So I'm saying the movie has no depth. The movie was lame. What more can I say.",1405468800,,2129,4.205378973105135

5941288,3,B00ANT85VY,"This movie has a great premise -- a taut nightmare for any parent -- and superb actors. If you sort of blur your eyes in many of the scenes, then you'll find it plausible as well. I just wish more attention had been paid to visualizing the details of what is on the face of it a very believable, gripping scenario.

There should be more stories about human trafficking, an unconscionable crime that goes on every day. To put the issue in an action movie with such top-flight talent is a good way to do it. I found Liam Neeson grimly entrancing, the setting gorgeous, and the hand-to-hand fight scenes fast and exciting. In general, the pacing and dialogue drew me in. However, it's a shame that the story includes so many tropes of the lazy action-movie writer: dodging automatic gunfire in an enclosed space (or taking cover behind car doors and sofas), keeping up with a car on foot, hot-wiring a car without any tools for getting into the steering column or stripping the wires, and (my favorite) ""processing"" a digital photo to magically increase its resolution. They add a new one on me, impersonating a Frenchman in France while speaking only American English.

The creators might say that these things are necessary in order to keep up the pace and to tell the story of one man in a lonely pursuit (rather than a team story). But instead of drawing viewers in by encouraging them to pay attention, the movie just hopes you won't notice or care about the holes.

Watch the movie for Neeson. Don't pay too much attention to the details.",1405123200,2,1541,4.596363636363637

Although slow at start since it must built the storyline and the characters, it is one of the most
fast moving, on the edge, high adrenaline film, only compared to movies such as the Bourne series.

The reborn Liam Neeson is a father with the particular set of skills that has become a hero of all the fathers
that want to protect their kids!

OK, it is a movie I know, but despite its heavy action, it also refers to the really
serious problem of human trafficking. A tremendous problem that sometimes
people should think about it! And through some powerful scenes of human decadence this movie succeeds in
pushing you think about the curse of human trafficking.

This is a great movie and fun to watch. Its's a guys movie so do not try to watch it
with the significant other!",1401321600,,847,4.341772151898734

5941333,2,B00ANT85VY,"Do you remember the middle of the last decade, when we good Americans were all down on the French and when Bill O'Reilly vowed to drink no more Cotes-du-Rhone and eat no more brie?  The days of ""freedom fries,"" in fact?  From that era (2006-07), here's a movie that shows us a real American -- willing to kill, maim, and torture in order to protect his 17-year-old baby girl.  Of course, he's played by an Irish actor, but let's forget that for the moment.  And at the beginning of the movie, we learn that his shallow wife has divorced him (he had been spending too much time protecting his country, presumably also killing, maiming, and torturing, because he's awfully good at these kinds of things), and now he has retired in order to try to maintain some contact with his daughter.  His daughter, who has clearly taken on the shallow values of her mother and stepfather, wants to go to Paris with a friend, but that turns out to be a lie.  She doesn't tell her dad that she really wants to follow U-2 around Europe because she knows that her dad won't sign the permission papers for that.  Hell, Dad doesn't feel real good about signing the permission paper for Paris.  But Mom is all for it, and Dad gives in and signs, even though he has a bad feeling about it.  Then on the very first afternoon in Paris, she's kidnapped and is about to be sold into what used to be called ""white slavery"" by a bunch of Albanians.

Dad is Liam Neeson, and he's a very competent killer, formerly employed by the US Government on matters of national security.  He has recently retired, so his skills have not atrophied.  He can avoid hails of AK-47 bullets, while dispatching his pursuers with well-placed single shots, and he can drive a car at speed the wrong way on Paris's one-way-streets like nobody's business.  By the time he gets on to the boat on the Seine where is daughter is being held, we know that the 10 or 12 men on the boat are as good as dead -- and very soon they are.

This is one of these movies where style or presentation trumps moral judgment.  You can't fault the pacing or the production values, and the visceral excitement of the chases and the fights tends to distract us from the fact that this a man who will torture and who is willing to kill even innocent people to do what has to be, in his view, done.  There's no remorse, no second guessing, no weighing the cost to his soul.  At the end, returning his daughter to the shallow mother, he seems untroubled by the whole experience, and his daughter seems remarkably untraumatized too: they haven't counted the cost -- because the genre of the movie won't let them -- to others or to themselves.  Liam is so untroubled that he doesn't even say to his ex-wife, ""I told you so"" -- so, you see, he IS capable of restraint.  He's not a monster. . .

This is a cynical and dishonest movie, pandering to the most dubious instincts of its historical moment.  Dick Cheney would have loved it, and maybe even Bill O'Reilly  . . . except that the director is FRENCH, for heaven's sake!  And the French in the movie are incompetent and corrupt, mere bureaucrats and not real soldiers for freedom.  But the French director and backers of this movie were savvy and cynical enough to know that a movie that ran down their own country might make a boatload of money in the States.  And so it did.

NOTE: My daughter had another reservation:  Neeson's character's total lack of interest in the other girls who have been put in his daughter's position.  He helps one, but only because he thinks she knows where his daughter is.  What about the rest?  After all, are these sloppy and corrupt French really going to make sure that they're OK . . .

5941385,5,B00ANT85VY,"...and if you like high body counts, gruesome and violent deaths handed out to despicable characters, and generalized high-octane mayhem, this is a great film. Sometimes I'm in the mood for something violent, but I often get too involved with the lead characters, worrying about the next bad thing that's going to happen, getting all tense, and end up not enjoying the show (I had to stop Reservoir Dogs about twenty times and come back to it to finish it. Breaking Bad? Had to quit watching it entirely).

Enter likable, non-meathead Badass Bryan Mills (caveat: I gotta say that if he were played by, say, Vin Diesel or some other muscled-up dude, I would have hated him and given this zero stars). I love not having to worry about Bryan Mills, as he is indestructible and unstoppable, a professional in a world of amateurs, dealing death with abandon and in some cases glee. He is three steps ahead of everyone at all times and is an absolute expert at freaking everything from fisticuffs to high-performance driving to torture to administering intravenous drugs. He will humiliate and beat, pistol-whip, shoot, stab, maim, or otherwise incapacitate everyone foolish enough to stand in his path. Even while handcuffed to an overhead pipe and being garroted, you know those six thugs trying to finish him off have seconds to live and it's just damn beautiful.

No, it's not realistic in any way, shape, or form--I mean, really, how many crimes (murders!) did he commit in 72 hours while still getting out of France with nary a gendarme to be seen?-- but for pure testosterone-fueled bullet-ridden ass-kicking turn-off-your-brain, bad-guys-get-what's-coming-to-'em fun, Taken is nearly as good as the last three 007 films.

5941411,5,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson is fantastic!  In the past I have liked his acting but in Takken he has shown total commitment to being the action hero.  This movie starts with an easy to follow beginning and quickly develops into a non-stop action thriller.  Liam Neeson was so believable in this role and he showed the world what action is all about.  An incredible performance.
Luc Besson has done it again.  As when I choose a book to read, I look at who created it.  Koontz, Brown, Tolkien, King, I know I will like, Luc Besson is the Tolkien of the screen in my view.  If Luc Besson's name appears, I know it will be a kick-butt movie.
I look for small details in action movies, the hero with a revolver that fires 100 rounds without an ammo change is fantasy, but Besson's movies have great detail and authenticity.  No one is perfect, but I see in this movie the hero puts a bullet into an enemy to make sure they don't get up again, and when he runs out of ammo, he reloads or picks up someone else's gun, (and actually checks to see if it's loaded), before taking care of more business.
Here is a director and actor who took the time and effort into making things exciting, believable and accurate.
Take it from someone who has seen a little ""real"" action, this movie shows it the way things should be done.  Take down the bad guy, make sure he doesn't get up and move on to the next threat.  Focus on the objective and do not let ANYTHING or ANYONE deter you from your path.  Dirtbags,(bad guys), should have no rights and receive no mercy, (loved the scene with the electricity), as they have none for their victims.
My only complaint or rather wish, would have been a little more back story or some involvement of his friends from the old days.  Maybe a Takken 3?",1392854400,,1756,4.336391437308868

5941415,4,B00ANT85VY,"Even if objectively this is a rather silly film, I still had GREAT TIME watching this guilty pleasure. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired super-secret super-spy. Some time earlier his wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) dumped him for a rich older guy and took his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) with her. It was only after his retirement that Bryan could move to California to be closer to his now 17-years old daughter, but it is difficult to him to re-connect with Kim, as his former wife hates his guts and sabotages his efforts in every possible way. It doesn't help also that Kim's stepfather is obscenely rich and spoils her silly and that Kim herself is a jaded brat with brains of a gerbil...

Then Kim goes to Paris with her slightly older, slutty and even more spoiled and brainless friend Amanda - and both girls get abducted by a gang of Albanian pimps... This will give Bryan a dreamed oportunity to humble his shrewish former wife, rub the face of her new husband in dirt, compensate finally for all the past humiliations, release all the accumulated anger and frustration and especially show to his daughter how much he really loves her. In the process the population of France, Albania and Saudi Arabia  will get significantly smaller...)))

Now, objectively, this is a very, VERY silly film, with some moments really outlandishly funny, like when we learn that in Paris, France the ""baguette"" is actually apparel...))) On anover hand however, the bad guys are so abject and Bryan's cause so noble (save his teen age daughter from being repeteadly raped until death follows), that it is a pure DELIGHT to see Liam Neeson cut his way through Paris underworld like a terminally pissed combined harvester through wheat...)))

Being myself a father of two daughters I couldn't help but LOVE the sight of rapists, pimps, women-trafficking slavers as well as their accomplices being viciously tortured, shot, stabbed, beaten to death, eviscerated, emasculated, beheaded, crushed with heavy engineering machines, drowned, set on fire, clubbed, thrown under speeding trucks, choked, boiled with hot steam, etc, etc.

Liam Neeson delivers an IMPRESSIVE performance in this film - honestly, even Chuck Norris would probably hesitate before going toe to toe against Bryan Mills...))) Famke Janssen also is excellent as a very attractive and distinguished cynical shrewish gold digger whom we want to bitch-slap every time she appears on the screen and Maggie Grace is even better as a teen aged girl who, even if she has the maturity and the IQ of a recently planted radish, can manipulate her dear old silly daddy into virtually anything...)))

If ""Taken"" is not taken too seriously, this is an absolutely delightful action film. Enjoy!",1392336000,,2796,5.012931034482759

Finally, justice! It's a touching story with the dad going after his daughter, too. The extended edition definitely had some footage & extra scenes I didn't remember seeing the first time I saw this film, so I was glad I bought it. It's also not overly violent because it doesn't show over-the-top gory details of the people who are killed. The subject matter is definitely adult though re: drugs, forced prostitution, murder, etc. & it's suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat. My husband thinks some of the tactics are far-fetched but I like it (reminds me of Mission Impossible) because I want to believe that a highly trained operative could solve this kind of crime.

5941441,5,B00ANT85VY,"TAKEN Produced by Luc Besson and Directed by some other French Director
i don't watch french films apart from Luc Besson's Directed films
everything about this film is excellent
Liam neeson steals the whole film of course, excellent written story, brilliantly Directed
i'm sure some of the scenes were Directed by Luc besson himself, but the credit goes to Pierre
the plot is basically about Liam's character Bryan's Daughter Maggie Grace who's been taken by Albanians in Paris
for Human trafficking and Bryan goes to get her back
some of the scenes are very Disturburbing especially the sex Hostel where many Girls have been
Drugged with Heroin and sold for sex
but Brilliant Directing, excellent performances by Maggie Grace and Liam neeson
it's full throttle edge of your seat from the first scene to the last scene
there's 2 versions the Theatrical version 90mins including credits
and the Unrated version which includes about 2mins of extra footage mainly more violence
i prefer the Unrated version myself
the blu-ray version has more special features, making of featurettes than the DVD
so best to get the blu-ray version
i definitely gave it 5 stars no Doubt about it

i've also seen the sequel TAKEN 2, which is basically the same film redone again
so i wasn't fully blown away with this sequel as i was with the original
probably about 50% blown away with this sequel
the sequel starts where the first one finished
where the father of one of the Drug dealers/traffickers that Bryan tortured/killed in the first film
 sets out for revenge on Bryan and his family with flashback scenes from the first film
and this time Bryan and his wife get Taken by the Albanians in Istanbul
while Maggie Grace tries to rescue her mom and dad
i couldn't see the point really on this sequel but just as much action as the first film
But still Liam neeson steals the film, aswell as Famke jansen and Maggie grace
Great performances No Doubt
so if you watch TAKEN, then you better to watch TAKEN 2 right after you finish the first film
cause the plot continues on from the first film

there's not much extras at all on the DVD or blu-ray version of TAKEN 2
there's no making of Documentary or anything
just a 3mins featurette on Sams tools of the Trade which just talks about his weapons really
and a 5-10mins interview with Liam neeson on TAKEN 2 that's all
the first film deserves 5 stars, the sequel deserves about 3-3.5 stars

5941445,2,B00ANT85VY,"I have looked forward to seeing Taken 1 and 2 for some time.  Recently moved and didn't have time to set up my blue ray theater system so I thought I'd relax and put the none blue ray disk into my lap top.  To my surprise I couldn't.  Windows 7 isn't compatible and there is no down load to assist. (Prompt said not enough space.)  Per Microsoft's web site, I must buy Windows 8 or 8.1 at over $100.  It also appears they are releasing Windows 9 some time this spring.  So why should I pay to upgrade to window 8.1 and then have to upgrade to windows 9 shortly after for another product.  Hey Microsoft. why don't you have a down load fix for this?  ( I recommend that there is a warning regarding this when you go to purchase this product.  That is why the low rating.  I wonder if all new release movies will have this issue?  Still haven't watched the movie.  The reason we pay more for the double disks is so we can watch a movie on an alternative player.",1388361600,,959,4.124324324324324

5941454,5,B00ANT85VY,"I missed this one probably due to lighter marketing and advertising than usual, but luckily found it on Netflix. A movie packs with a lot of actions, close-quarter combat, violations, and one's existential meaning in the context of life. This confirms my bias that spending time with my kids is way more meaningful than devoting yourself to work (or in this case, to the nation). This way, you do not become regretful once your kids are grown up and keep their distance from you because you were too busy working when they needed you the most.",1387929600,,543,4.666666666666667

5941470,3,B00ANT85VY,"First off, the mediocre rating I'm giving the movie is not because of the film's cinematic quality, it's because of the video problems I'm experiencing.  I'm not going to review the movie; it's old enough that it really doesn't need one more person's assessment (I really did like it though).  Although I am not having an issue playing the disc at all, as many 1-star reviewers have noted, I experienced horrible macro-blocking and strange light/dark bands flashing on the screen for about 2/3 of the movie.  I had rented the DVD years ago, and I actually like the movie (shameless action movie entertainment) but I wanted the Blu Ray version.  I don't know if anybody else has had the same issue as me, but you can clearly see very distracting pixelated areas in dark scenes, and huge bands about 1/3 of the height of my 1080p tv where the colors alternate between darker and lighter shades of the rest of the screen, and it kept alternating, so I would see a light picture across the top and bottom, dark across the center, and it would flip around and alternate, just to make sure I didn't forget about it and actually enjoy the movie. I played it on my PC's blu-ray player with PowerDVD 13.  I will try it in my Panasonic player, and maybe the PS3 to be sure, but I haven't had issues with any other discs.  I watched Pacific Rim, Oblivion, Man of Steel, and I Am Legend, all new (to me) Blu-Rays this week without a hitch.  Also, the back of my movie's case had a 2"" cut down the center, as if a carpet knife or box-cutter had gotten to it.  The discs reveal no physical damage damage at all.",1386374400,,1597,4.408163265306122
5941471,5,B00ANT85VY,Liam Neeson is an excellent actor. He doesn't miss a beat in this suspenseful thriller. He saves his daughter after being kidnapped while being on the phone with her.,1386374400,,166,4.758620689655173

5941484,5,B00ANT85VY,"TAKEN is one of the best hard-boiled action films ever made. Emotionally charged is how I want to describe TAKEN, but that is an understatement. Singularly, Liam Nelson's no-nonsense performance makes this film. He is sensitive and laidback, but don't get him mad. Yet, he keeps a cool head and a keen mind to his sharp intellect underneath the all the mayhem and that is what really makes this film a cut above so many other films similar to this genre.",1385510400,,454,4.617283950617284

It's one of those movies that you discover new nuances with each viewing. To me, that's the mark of a movie worth watching over and over again. I'm not going into the plot. I'm sure other reviews have already performed the ""spoiler"" function, other than saying Liam Neeson does a great job of taking his place up there with Steven Segall, Chuck Norris and all the other actors who've played ""kick-butt"" heroes.",1383955200,,546,4.47

5941504,5,B00ANT85VY,"Liam brings the action genre to real a level with his acting skills. That's why Taken is successful. Stathem and Wahlberg are fine, but Liam brings a big bag of realism to the role. He doesn't rip his shirt off before a fight or spout cheesy lines every two seconds. Up to this point action films were all the same, or maybe the acting was just okay. The story here is good & simple and Liam elevates it. I look forward to Taken 3 that they announced will happen. Great decision for Liam to cross into the action world as a leading star.",1382054400,,537,4.223300970873787

5941510,4,B00ANT85VY,"This was not necessarily totally new material (we've seen tons of kidnapping movies, including with determined fathers and even movies with sex trafficking as the reason for the kidnapping.)

I think what made this good was:
1) Liam Neeson...perfect role for him.  He's such a dapper, international man.  The obvious plastic surgery is bothersome, but he is forever a 6'4"" hunk and hero.
2) All the smart little ways he was always tricking the bad guys and getting what he needed.
3) Paris.

The daughter was an annoying, spoiled brat and the ex-wife was an ice queen.  Ick to them both.  Honestly, were it not for Neeson, this would be much less of a ride.

I would not buy it, but by all means it's worth a rent.",1381017600,,714,4.53125

5941515,5,B00ANT85VY,"This is not an action movie HOWEVER all of the action scenes are great! this movie is all about what a father is willing to do to save his daughter from international scum bags. Liam Neeson is a great actor and is perfect for this Revenge/vigilante role. Neeson plays a Retired international intelligence agent; who will do anything to save his daughter from international bad guys. The movie did a good job of getting its point across without getting too gruesome, sappy or preachy. Sure it's not the most realistic action movie ever made but it is Reality based and not completely unrealistic like most action movies. if you like Suspense, Action, or just want to watch a well scripted movie then Taken series is a good place to start.",1380672000,,737,4.676923076923077

5941521,5,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson plays an agent who retires so he can reconnect with his 16 year-old daughter, who has grown up with his ex-wife and her second husband. When the daughter gets a chance to accompany her best friend on a trip to Paris, her father reluctantly gives her permission, but makes her promise to call him as soon as she gets there. During that phone call both girls are violently abducted while the father, helpless, listens. The rest of the movie is his desperate, frantic attempt to find and rescue her before she is sold as a sex slave. Graphic violence, car chases, fights.  I enjoyed it and my husband loved it.",1379548800,,619,4.526785714285714

""Taken"" has a beautiful picture, with very accurate colors (as with the flesh tones, for example), vivid colors, and it's very sharp.  The audio is excellent as well. I'm very pleased with this purchase.

GREAT job on this film's Blu-Ray picture, just beautiful HD quality. One of the best blu-rays, quality-wise, that I've seen!

Totally engrossing, fast-paced, spellbinding action movie, too.  Truly one of the best movies made, of ANY genre, since the year 2000, in my humble opinion. (Generally, I'm not even into action films.)  Liam Neeson, and I'd guess perhaps a double he may have had, are incredibly good-- looking really talented, very believable, at fighting (usually against men with weapons!)-- in the several fighting scenes.",1378598400,,851,5.13768115942029

The movie reveals what Muslims are really doing in the present world. They are real villains. I only had to suspend disbelief a few times, as when Liam manages to kill large groups of the villains; but then so does Bruce Willis. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that I reserve 5 for movies like Avatar, Back to the Future, and the original first three Star Wars movies.

American Southerners, which are the three choices you have when casting bad guys in movies.

Liam Neeson went above and beyond in this role. It makes you never want anyone to mess with him. And while I'm not a parent myself, I can see how the premise of this film could potentially terrify a parent; No one wants their child taken hostage. God forbid my future children get taken hostage, but if that ever happens, I'd legitimately want someone like Liam Neeson to be there to get them back.
All of that being said, I highly recommend this film. I enjoyed it so much that I inevitably made everyone around me watch it for themselves. (They all enjoyed it. And I'm sure you will, too.)",1370649600,,862,4.496815286624204

5941618,3,B00ANT85VY,"Taken is the sort of film where you pretty much need to leave your common sense at the door and just have a good time. Yes it's about as predictable as it get's, and there are some issues that make it rather silly. Liam Neeson is a superb actor but as dumb as it sounds this role would be better suited for someone like Kiefer Sutherland. Basically the character Neeson plays is Jack Bauer with a different face. But a more important issue is how silly the whole story is. Neeson's character is a highly trained ex-government agent who has a daughter who wants to travel to Europe following U2's tour dates as they travel. Neesun's character knows the world all too well and is concerned for her safety. He tries to talk her out of it knowing how dangerous it is to travel to another country. To make a long story short- He gives in an let's her go. Well she arrives, and in less than a few hours She get's kidnapped by criminals who want to sell her on the black market as a sex slave. Like the audience is actually supposed to swallow such nonsense? Naturally he must go and rescue his daughter on his own, and he expertly kills at least 50 people on his journey until he finally finds her. He's (of course) left almost unwounded through the entire affair. The good news is that the film is filled with some excellent and well crafted action sequences that make it worth seeing. But if you are a 24 fan it's nothing you haven't seen a hundred times.

distinctly American story: given that the authorities are bound to be
incompetent or corrupt, you have to go rogue to get anything done,
such as saving your daughter from white slavers. This is a brutal
film, with an unending supply of bad guys and only one good guy, and
the suspense is tremendous. What holds it together, really, is Neeson's
steely command--amid all the action, he is steadfast, smart, and
incredibly resourceful. Don't as much as blink, because the surprises
come so suddenly that you'll miss them.",1367884800,,585,4.801980198019802

Pretty predictable as a movie goes, but still well worth my pittance paid out for it.",1367798400,,506,4.260416666666667
5941622,4,B00ANT85VY,"This is NOT normally the type of movie that I gravitate towards (lots of violence), but it was easy to be taken in with the good guy/bad guy plot and rooting for the good guy. The basic storyline is that a retired anti-terrorist type of guy's daughter gets kidnapped and he goes to rescue her. In the context of that story, I was able to cheer when all the murder and mayhem happened.

The action NEVER lags. Even though the movie is largely about ""beat up this guy, kill that guy"" the way in which it is done is entertaining. Since dad has 96 hours to find his daughter, you always have the sense that time is running out. This makes the movie move very fast.

Liam Neeson is always good. The other actors are also good. The weak link would be the daughter though. She acts goofy (running everywhere with her hair flying), but it doesn't detract too much.

5941630,3,B00ANT85VY,"Taken is an enjoyable film for what it is.  The plot is nothing new.  Many other action films have similar plots like Commando.  So, it all comes down to how well and different it is executed.  I think Taken is executed fairly decently.  Though, this is mainly due to Liam Neeson and his performance, like in the famous telephone scene.  Without Neeson, this movie would not be nearly as enjoyable.

The acting is alright.  No one did a bad job performance wise.  The only character worth talking about is Bryan Mills, played by Liam Neeson.  He is very likable, very driven, and kicks ass.  There are times were he comes off very mean and extreme.  However, I still liked him as a character, because of his situation.  I'm glad he came out on top in the end.  The rest of the characters are bland.  Maggie Grace's character is the typical teenage girl that gets kidnapped.  I did kind of feel for her, but not much, because I barely got to know her.  Famke Janssen, I did not care for at all.  She did nothing, and was very mean throughout most of the film.  The villains, I thought, were kind of nothing villains.  I did not find them intimidating.

The film does move at a good pace.  The action scenes are fun and well-choreographed.  The final fight I really enjoyed.

Overall this is a generic, but fun action movie.  Its saving grace is definitely Liam Neeson and his character.  I recommend this to people who are fans of action movies.  Those who are not fans of action films, I would skip this.",1367020800,,1504,4.453874538745388

As I've said before, every decade has a film or two in the action genre that defines the age; Dirty Harry 70s, Lethal Weapon & First Blood 80s, Point Break 90s.

I remember spotting a commercial for Taken on YouTube several months before the film arrived in the US. The film opened in Europe and made it's way slowly about the world. I kept tracking its earnings and was psyched to see it. I was not disappointed.

Taken is a relentless action film. When Brian Mills' (Neeson)daughter is taken by sex slave traders while on a trip to Paris, Mills, a former CIA special services type springs into action.

Seldom does a move live up to it's trailer. Usually the trailer showcases the best action scenes to lure an audience in. Not so with Taken. Taken delivers on the promise of its trailer. Daughter taken + Daddy goes ballistic = lots of dead scumbags!

I cannot overemphasize this last point. Every scene in this film serves only to give Neeson more people to kill...all to our delight. I saw this in a theater with a good crowd. People were cheering with every shattered skull, ruptured larynx, bullet between the eyes or steak knife to the heart. Neeson is a force of nature as he moves from one act of carnage to the next.

He even shoots his friend's wife! How's that for badass?

There's also some great dialogue to boot.

'I'll tear down the Eiffel tower if I have to!' (He says this to his friend in the French Secret Service!)

'Now's not the time for dick measuring, Stuart!' (He says this to his X-wife's new husband!)

'You either give me what I need or this switch will stay on until they turn the power off for lack of payment on the bill.' (He says this to a dude he's electrocuting)

and who could forget...

'I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.'

Jeepers. I'm ttrembling as I type this.

Be warned, there's no philosophy here. No attempt to understand why they do what they do. Nobody plants a placenta in a garden or remembrance or any of that nonsense. Neeson just leaves the dirty buggers behind. I don't know how many people he kills in this movie. I tried to count but lost track in all the excitement.

For those of you who haven't seen Taken see it. And just remember...there is a Taken 2. And yes, the dummies come after him again.

Liam Neeson is the perfect character for the over-protective father figure.  I admire his passion to have a safe return of his daughter.  I understand that this movie is not based on a true story, but I am guessing it can relate to the real deal.  Going into the second movie, there was never a dull moment in this one either.

5941716,5,B00ANT85VY,"The toughest part of making a good action film is the story. When creating an action film, it's very easy for the director to get ""action happy"" and leave the story behind. What makes ""Taken"" special is how while the story is nothing complex or mind boggling, the prelude into the action is done in such a way where you truly care about Bryan Mills, (Neeson) so later on when the action picks up it's not mindless, we are in Neeson's corner.

""Taken"" is about a divorced man named Bryan Mills. He is an ex C.I.A. operative which drew him away from his family. Now retired, he decides to move closer to his only daughter who he at best has a rocky relationship with. His daughter Kim is invited to spend the weekend in Paris with some friends, but needs her father's signature in order to leave the country. Reluctantly, he signs the papers with numerous conditions that she must follow. When Kim and her friend arrive in Paris, Kim's friend reveals to her and a random, handsome looking man they shared a cab with that they have the apartment all to themselves. This mysterious man from the cab volunteers to pick the two girls up for a party he invited them to. However, when he returns, he brings his fellow East Europe gang members who kidnap the two girls and begin to sell them into prostitution. Bryan Mills uses his skills from the C.I.A. to rescue his daughter.

While this plot seems simple and overdone in the film industry, what makes this film work is how director Pierre Morel works the character development and the wonderful performance from Liam Neeson.",1361232000,,1569,4.580071174377224
5941717,2,B00ANT85VY,"I purchased this movie because it was strongy recommended by a trusted friend and I was buying another movie anyway, so i thought for the price I would just purchase this one rather than rent it since my frined had told me it was a great movie.  It was just ok, I probably won't watch it again and I'll end up giving away the DVD.  Liam Neeson is good in this movie and it's a good action movie, which I normally like, but the plot was just way too far fetched for me.  I also found the character of the daughter and ex-wife very annoying, as the daughter was just a whiny spolied rich girl that gets whatever she wants and the ex-wife seemed very mean unnecessarliy to the exhusband, which made it hard for me to find any sympathy for those characters.

5941733,3,B00ANT85VY,"Never go to Europe. Never! It's pretty much a foregone conclusion that you'll be groomed and sold into sex slavery the literal second you step off the plane. Paris in particular is swarming with prozzies and greasy crooks from some former Soviet block hellhole who kidnap pretty young girls, hook them on drugs, and sell them to morbidly obese Sultans while setting-up sex cabins on building sites, holding sex eBays in the basements of upper class parties, and living in all-male rape communes with the proceeds from their unscrupulous businesses being kept in a coffee can on the kitchen shelf.

And producer/director Luc Besson and Pierre Morel are French too, so they know what they are talking about. Liam Neeson knows it too, but his sullen ex-wife believes the world to be full of sunshine and candy and has no problem with sending their unnaturally juvenile 17-year-old daughter off to Paris with her slut best friend. Just as daddy predicted, the dirty foreign animals grab her and hoist her away for auction.

Luckily for daddy he has a very particular set of skills that make him a nightmare for foreigners and he goes off to Paris to raise hell. The detective element is played down, down, down (Neeson collects hair samples for no particular reason, never bothers to hide his accent) and the merciless xenophobia is cranked up, up, up. It's not much different from Death Wish in that the crimes established in the first act are merely there to justify the sadism that follows.

The film is not that vivid however. Had it been made in the 80s I am sure that the violence would be visceral and effective, but in the post-Bourne world it's shot and cut in a way where you can't really see anything, regardless of which version you are watching.

The material is thin, the action is only slightly above tepid, and the killing never really goes beyond gunplay. Taken was a huge, surprise hit when released in the US in early 2009 (several months after its European release) and seemed to naturally tap into America's distrust of other nations and hunger for killing.

If you want to take the movie's advice then it's best to stay on US soil, where no one has ever been the victim of violence.

The Blu-ray features a nice 2.35:1 1080p picture with DTS HD-MA sound and a small amount of features.",1360627200,2,2303,4.702233250620347

I also didn't know that the closing credits are where the Alex Clare song ""Too Close"" got its break, but that's a great reason to stick around.  If you're looking for dramatic depth and all that junk, go look at some Oscar nominated schlock.

I watched this for the first time last weekend (2013) long after its release and I had missed it.  We did a double feature with Taken 2, and the combo was great. Action packed, emotionally gripping, great work all around, and just enough pathos to be more than pure popcorn.

5941738,4,B00ANT85VY,"Bryan (played by Liam Neeson), retired, has very special skills honed while a top-notch field agent for the American CIA. Bryan is also a divorced, very divorced from his ex-wife's perspective, parent of a precocious teenage daughter with singing aspirations and a yen to head to Europe, Paris first stop, in order to follow the international rock group U-2 (?-for a 2008 teenager but we will let that pass). Those Bryan honed spy skills turned out to come in very handy, once he relented and let that wayward daughter head to Europe. See almost as soon as she (and her dippy friend, her older girlfriend) , as single good-looking teenagers on the loose, are spotted and violently kidnapped by a nefarious international gang of white-slavers who are looking to place young girls in their whorehouses or sell them off to the highest bidder.

Thus, we have the perfect storm between a man with a ruthless set of spy skills and a previously neglected daughter in distress and Bryan must use every one of them before he is through. The bulk of the film revolves around Bryan chasing, hitting, shooting, beating, torturing, shooting (oh, I said that), interrogating, driving, leaping, mano y mano fighting, and just plain being a mal hombre as he works his way through the litany of bad guy involved in the white-slave trade from lowly thuggish Albanians (who seemingly collectively cannot fight off one guy) to middle- man pimp daddy French society figures to paid off French security agents to oil-soaked depraved sheiks who specialize in deflowering young girls before he saves his still chaste daughter (naturally) and sends her back to California and a grateful mother, and more respectful ex-wife.

Recently in reviewing another protective parent drama, 2001s The Deep End,  I noted that I had been listening to a ""high brow"" talking- head discussion about the sea-change that has been occurring in the way American parenting has evolved over the past thirty years or so (the speakers however covered themselves with the caveat that this trend excluded certain ethnic, racial, cultural and class exceptions, in short, this was about how middle, now middle, and upper class parents raise their progeny the cohort of that and this film). The gist of the argument was that the new ""coddle"" generation (say those under thirty, okay) have never learned to fail, their parents have never allowed them to experience failure, and therefore they have never learned how to fly out of the nest unaided and therefore are ill-equipped to face the wicked old world and its snares. And that is a future problem, no question. However I would amend that statement here and say that old Bryan, with remarkably few scars, won the parent of the year award here, protective or not.",1360454400,,2761,4.946120689655173

5941740,5,B00ANT85VY,This is a different type of role for Liam. He was great in it. Reminds me of the 80's actioners,1360454400,,95,3.8
5941741,4,B00ANT85VY,Liam is a soft-spoken bad-ss as he does anything and everything to get his daughter back from the bad guys.,1360368000,,107,4.4

5941745,5,B00ANT85VY,"Yes, its only an action movie; Yes, the script has more holes than the victims of the main character! Yes, Neeson's rampage in Paris is very implausible; Yes, its not Oscar material... but its a very good movie. I give it a solid 9. I left the movie feeling very satisfied. Its that kind of movie that is fun and thrilling and brainless at the same time. Doesn't get tiresome. When its outrageous its funny... when the action gets going you feel right in it all.

When you finish seeing the movie you do wonder why Bond and Bourne aren't as macho or mean. Niam's character
Bryan (""B"" letter too) beats up baddies way better and he looks more scary and real somehow than those other agents. A great flick for action junkies, or just anyone who wants to spend some time watching bad guys getting what they deserve!",1360022400,,812,4.449664429530201
5941746,5,B00ANT85VY,"I purchased this CD for my daughter and grandchildren to watch and insisted that they watch the CD prior to my daughter and granddaughter's trip to New York last year.  My daughter and granddaughter were also quite insistent that it was safe for my granddaughter to travel alone to Korea to visit one of her Korean friends.  Instead of watching only a little bit of the CD, my daughter and grandchildren were spell bound and could not stop watching this CD and learning from it.  The contents were instilled in their minds, so much so, any future plans for my granddaughter to travel alone to Korea have been squelched.  Also my granddaughter who prior to the film told her Mom that she wanted to be with her friends while in New York and didn't want her Mom to be following her around now begged her Mom not to let her out of her sight.  You can tell young and older people about what to be careful of when traveling, etc.; however seeing what could happen and did happen is ever so much more powerful than the spoken words.

An aged good guy armed with hand guns vs a truck load of bad guys in their prime with machine guns. As always, bad guys' machine guns can't hit a thing, even at close range. And of course, the good guy never missed.

I watched it based on the rave reviews here, but I just couldn't get into it. A barely armed guy in his 60s wipes out a truck load of young guys with machine guns. That's just too much, even for Hollywood. Unless, Liam was secretly using the Force.",1359244800,,538,4.173076923076923

The plot of letting your daughter go to France on her own with her friend and then being kidnapped is realistic. After the problem surfaced, the action takes place one scene after another. You will not get bored. There is always something happening. If you want to watch something that takes your mind away from work or school with lots of scenes that differ from daily life so that you can feel like you have escaped, then this film will do the job. The end result satisfied you at the end but not until the end of the film does the action stop. So I recommend this film to keep your mind from being preoccupied with your daily ritual.

Top notch acting,great film work,outstanding fight sequences and a storyline that is compelling for any man or woman out there with a pulse. More spellbinding than any horror flick,because this is a reality based concept.

What I find most commendable is that as violent and adult in nature as the theme of the movie is,there is precious little profane language,little or no graphic bloody scenes and no nudity that I can think of.

5941843,3,B00ANT85VY,"A parent's protective, desperate fury is a fantastic vehicle for justifying the kind of unabashed mayhem and destruction that Taken delivers.  Liam Neeson channels righteous anger in very focused ways, making some of the questionable things his character does seem purposeful, despite running counter to what the ideal action hero would do.

The primary story of an abducted daughter, kidnapped on a trip her estranged father felt was too dangerous in the first place, almost would have performed better against a generic backdrop of ""some other city"".  The unique character of Paris and the foreign way that police and intelligence matters are handled served as unnecessary distractions.

At the end of the day, the design of the movie feels like a good idea hijacked by movie execs.  Light spoiler alert, but as an example, the movie's hero moves mainly unscathed through numerous violent encounters with villains until, surprise, the super-evil and smarmy looking second-in-command manages to wound him in a gunfight.  Fear not, as he was ruthlessly, but justifiably, stabbed by his own knife/impaled on a stick/thrown down a well.  Honestly, I can't remember as I had really started to lose interest in the specifics by this point, but I hope you get the general idea.

Taken is probably best watched when you're at home, sick with the flu, passing in and out of consciousness from the lingering effects of last night's Ny-Quil.  It's not horrible by any stretch, but ends up as a bit of a disappointment.",1357257600,,1509,5.05241935483871

I like that the movie tackled this subject, but viewers should be aware of the fact that some scenes in the movie are emotionally disturbing because they show kidnapped women involuntarily strung out on drugs and being used for sex. It's a movie worth watching more because of the subject it tackles than because of the action, so viewers should be prepared for it to be heavier than a Bourne movie.",1356912000,,539,4.74468085106383

You cannot get more simple than an estranged  father, trying NOT to be estranged, while everyone else; ex wife, daughter and ex wife's new husband, doing everything in their power to keep him estranged, and then showing this man on the outside being the ONLY one who can save the daughter after she is kidnapped and is about to be sold into the sex trade. He does everything he can do to find his unappreciative spoiled, but missing daughter. More importantly, he has a special set of skills that are useful in tracking and killing anyone who gets in the way of him finding his daughter. Now, add Liam Neeson and martial arts, and you have a high octane mix ready to blow you away.  There is no deep thoughts here...no mystery, no thriller twists, just a hard hammered fist of a man plowing through people, trying to find his little girl.

The thing that detracts from the realism, that many movies are guilty of, is how the lower-level bad guys get taken out of commission with one punch or kick, while the bosses take several minutes to incapacitate.

If you don't mind some great fight scenes bloody bodies, and things getting blown up then this is the movie for you.  It is a very enjoyable movie and I never get tired of watching it because of the great acting by Liam Neeson, the plotline, and the scenes of Paris landscape.  It is one of few action movies or movies in general I can watch from start to finish in one setting, so if you have yet to watch this movie pick it up and savor a great action movie with lots of elements for the fans to enjoy as they watch the movie, you won't regret buying it trust me.",1355961600,,824,4.093167701863354

5941922,4,B00ANT85VY,"First, I don't like that Amazon integrates all the various formats into one review section.

Second, as a movie review, I really like this movie. I know a lot is unbelievable and even impossible. I like the basic storyline and the intense action. It also hits on a real life issue of human trafficking. Exposing issues like this may help make people be more aware and help to stop such heinous acts. Again, as a movie, I think some people are reading too much into it giving it undo lowered ratings. Movies are for entertainment and this movie is entertaining. I  think Shrek is an entertaining movie and I don't expect to see a large green ogre appearing around the corner.

Third, as a bluray DVD which I purchased, I am very disappointed. The quality of the picture is only about equivalent to a standard DVD and the dark scenes are very grainy looking worse than VHS if any of you out there even remember VHS. Some good with the DVD format is the extra scenes and a cool death/injured counter throughout the movie. Again, all for your entertainment.

Overall, I give the movie a strong 4.5 stars and the bluray disc only 3 stars giving a total of 3.75 stars for the bluray movie of Taken.",1355184000,,1192,4.47926267281106

Then Taken will have to file a restraining order against you, because you're about to send it a ""fan letter"" gushing about how much you love it, in individually cut-out newspaper and magazine letters. After putting this piece of cinematic history-making bliss into your DVD player, one of two things will happen: You'll never be able to hit the eject button, or, you'll fall victim to spontaneous combustion after witnessing such skull fracturing terrorist slaying wickedly gnarly coolness, exuded by the then little known William John Neeson. Read on...

Liam (Or ""Li-li"" as I call him) is a cherished friend of mine, and when we hang out on the weekends when our schedules allow, it's such a blast drudging up ole' set stories from all the insanity that ensued while filming the eventual sure-fire global sensation that was at the time titled ""I was Zeus, trained Batman, and mentored Jedis, and you took my daughter!?"" (It was later decided that ""Taken"" seemed more fitting for box office marques). Oh boy, I remember the time Liam leaned over to me off-camera between takes, and said ""Hey, Aaron... give me some sort of hardcore ominous monologue that I can use when I'm on the horn with Marco from the sex-slave trading bizz,"" and I immediately lit up like a Christmas tree when it hit me: LIAM, TELL THEM YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS! Now you know, the rest of the story.

If you don't own this Blu Ray DVD, Liam will find you... and he will ask to be invited in for a screening with you. He is, after all, an overly polite gentleman. So, buy this Blu Ray, because Li-Li has a habit of showing up at the earlier hours of the morning.",1354147200,4,1725,4.671052631578948

Problem was the streaming,
The movie stopped several times due to lack of bandwidth, I tested my internet  speed immediately (Ethernet to the modem) to be more that 10Mbit (15 peak) every-time it froze, so I believe the bottleneck was on the server side of amazon.

I guess is better to get the disk on redbox or try the non-HD version next time, as the 2X extra cost for the convenience of streaming  was destroyed  with the extended pauses, I don't know why they do not increase the buffering on streaming",1353888000,,535,4.589473684210526

Now Kim's father, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is an ex-CIA man and is immediately on the case. The rest of the film is about Bryan's attempts to track down the kidnappers. There's lots of action as Mills demolishes all the Albanian and Islamic opposition as he rescues his girl, but the number of victims he manages to execute while hardly sustaining a scratch himself is scarcely believable.

5941973,4,B00ANT85VY,"If you like the type of movie that has plot twists, unexpected turns, and requires some thought to predict what may happen next, this is not your movie.

I found ""Taken"" to be standard fare for action/thrillers; it's the skillful acting and the exacting of revenge for an unspeakable crime that kept me watching and wanting more. If my daughter (or niece) was kidnapped and sold into sex slavery, I'd definitely want to do to the ""bad guys"" what they get in ""Taken."" Liam Neeson is a great actor and can convincingly play any role, and that applies to his character in this movie. Maggie Grace performs well in her role, and Famke Janssen (for whom we see too little) is also very convincing. The other bit players were well cast.

The biggest complaint I have is kind of trivial. After some of the more intense action scenes, I came to realize there wasn't any blood being spilled. Sure enough, when I slowed the movie down to single frames, none of the actors have blood packs on them when they get shot. The blood is added afterward. This was especially apparent when Neeson's character shoots someone in the face at point-blank range and instead of his head exploding, his head snaps back  no blood at all.

I have heard that Taken Two has been made an is out or to be realesed soon. I can't wait to see this movie. I am sure it is a sequal. I have heard that it is better than the first Taken. If it is better it will really be good. This movie is equalivent to a James Bond movie with all the fast action just not as much teck stuff.

I only deducted one star because the body count explodes above what is believable in movies and up into video game territory.  It looks almost too effortless for him to track down and eliminate these bad guys though they certainly deserved to die down to the last man.  If you liked the 1980's ""one man army"" type of movie you will instantly feel at home watching this.",1352160000,,469,4.559523809523809

5941996,5,B00ANT85VY,"""Taken"" is a very good film for those who really like a lot of martial arts and action films. Liam Neeson is a""retired government employee"" who over the course of his many years had acquired ""special skills""; which is exactly what he uses to rescue his teenage daughter from Albanian human traffickers in Paris. When he encounters many ""bad guys"" in a particular spot, it didn't matter to him if it was 4 or 9; he could take them all on! Liam Neeson is of course known to many Sci-Fi fans from the 2nd set of ""Star Wars"" films; and earlier than that he played the lead in ""Darkman"".",1351987200,,582,4.348623853211009

The preview looked good and I decided to order the movie, even though a friend thought I wouldn't like it.
It was an action-packed story, well acted, and despite the heavy action throughout, it still found time to touch on relationships and the human desire to be part of a meaningful relationship.  It showed that the true meaning of love will motivate endeavour and sacrifice.
When I saw that ""Taken 2"" was in the pipeline, I signed up to be notified when it became available.....but then, I have found that Liam Neeson is a wonderful actor and brings something special to his roles.",1351900800,,735,4.6106870229007635

5942006,2,B00ANT85VY,"I hate to say it, but this is a perfectly awful film.

Right from the start, there is something wrong with the tone of the film, as the retired agent is trying to get close to the daughter he alienated by his long and mysterious absences.  The viewer gets dished up a dripping melodrama about a painful divorce, with all the hot button scenes - trying to get her attention with a gift, his ex-wife standing in the way the whole while with bitter sarcasm, and the innocent (beautiful) daughter pampered by her new dad - that are supposed to pull at the heartstrings.  The acting was so wooden and the dialogue so stilted that I couldn't believe any of it.

Then suddenly, the tone shifts:  dad excessively worries about the daughter going to Europe on her own at 17, and sure enough, she is immediately abducted by the worst kind of guy and gang.  But dad happens to be available and puts his ""special skills"" to work, becoming a sudden superhero, in a blur of brutal violence, questionable methods to put it mildly, and an entry into the underworld of modern slavery and prostitution.  This section is better, if you are looking for an action film with a lone good guy fighting packs of baddies.  I enjoyed this part more, though wondered about the PG-13 rating.  It is raw, ugly, and full of blatant stereotypes.  That he rescues her - miraculously not violated or even deflowered, but right at the moment a fat ugly sheik is about to have his way with her - is to be expected.  But all credibility is lost - seeing that he is also now a criminal fugitive in France, you wonder how he gets her out.  It is so ridiculously unbelievable that I could never completely go with the flow for fun.

It is shocking how stupid this all is.  What a disappointment.  Not recommended.",1351468800,,1773,4.462732919254658

HOWEVER , the THINKING side ; father lost daughter to criminals ; OH YEAH !! all that destruction and MAYHEM is possible . i would give this movie 10 stars for keeping the action in  REAL WORLD . the ACTION is excellent and done with MUCH forethought and planning . Liam's character chases down a CARTEL of sex slavers wrecking half of FRANCE to find his daughter ; simple , basic theme covering all human time and emotion .
  if you want explosions and ""RAMBO"" , it aint here , AND still gives you a similar feel . ""Never mess with mama bear"" a common phrase .... well , watch this movie and see what POPPA BEAR might well do . OH YEAH !! not enough humor , is my only true complaint . too intense too long and still movie compels one to watch it over again .
  STUDY for the underlying REDEMPTION idea woven in story base . Many a blue collar guy will feel a good ARGH ARGH !! POWER !! near the end .

One might argue that this is meant to be a fast-paced thriller that will provide a couple of hours and entertainment and nothing more.  But for my part I couldn't lose myself in this movie on account of being unable to believe that Liam Neeson could be this sort of man, or that anybody in the world had such a skill set.

Also, ***spoilers below***.

The Film: I don't know what people expect from movies - I don't know exactly how some people can think this is a 5 star movie while others think it's the worst thing ever made.  That just seems implausible.  But there's no accounting for taste, I suppose.  For me, this is what good action movies are like.  There are very few frills, the pace is a dead sprint after the initial set up, and there isn't anything in the story to get in the way of the action.  This is an action movie, right?  Maybe you want something different...in that case this movie isn't for you.  I don't think you're wrong.  I don't think you have bad taste.  I just like simple, straight forward action movies.  That's what Taken is, as far as I can tell.
Is Liam a good guy?  I don't know.  Not all movies are about good guys vs. bad guys.  Some movies are about a slightly-past-his-prime bad ass who wants his daughter back.  Oh, that's this movie.  Do you have to suspend disbelief throughout...yes...but...that's what movies are about, right?  By the end of the movie Liam's character is limping, stabbed, bruised, and exhausted.  Is it TOTALLY believable?  No, of course not.  If it were totally believable the movie would have ended with Liam heading home never to see his daughter again, probably only after the US negotiated for his release from French prison for running amok, etc.  Do you want to see that movie?  I don't.

So, the movie is simple and linear.  Ex-preventer bad ass Neeson goes and gets his daughter back leaving a trail of bodies in his wake.  Either that's your cup of tea or it isn't.

So, why the 4 star rating?  Well, the Blu-ray didn't want to cooperate with my player.  The super-impressive and action-packed menus apparently overwhelm my bottom of the heap Blu-ray player.  Call me crazy, but it seems like a blu-ray release should play on the lowest common denominator.  The movie looks and sounds great once my player grunts and slogs through the menus and gets started, but it took like 20 minutes - no kidding.  Someone please tell me that it's my player for sure and I will sort that out.  Until that time, though, I'm calling the blu-ray release a stinker.",1342656000,2,2410,4.619385342789598
5942079,4,B00ANT85VY,"It's been a long time since I watched an action movie and was so involved, riveted to the screen, and rooted so much for the main character as when I saw last weekend the thriller Taken (2008) written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel. As the action movies go, this is very entertaining and dynamic picture.

The plot involves the kidnapping of an American girl (Maggie Grace) vacationing with a friend in Paris, by the gang of Albanian human traffickers specializing in selling young women into forced prostitution. Her estranged father Bryan (Liam Neeson), a retired CIA agent, the member of the elite ""Special Activities Division"" Black operations is on the phone with his daughter at the very moment of kidnapping and he's got just a few days to find out who is behind the crime and to try to get his daughter back before it is too late. If you've seen the trailer for the movie, the Neeson's close up and his short but convincing speech addressed to the invisible unknown man who is listening to his daughter's cell phone, tell you everything you have to know: ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" The film follows this statement closely, and makes it a really fast running 93 you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long minutes. The plot is anything but new - back in 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger as retired elite commando had only a few hours to find and rescue his daughter from an exiled dictator. The first and by far the best season of hit TV series 24 had Kiefer Sutherland as LA based CTU Agent Jack Bauer chasing of all sorts of terrorists who taken his teenage daughter. In its bets moments, Taken brings as much excitement and adrenalin as these classics. Another thought came to my mind while watching the movie, if ever Liam Neeson was considered for the part of Bond, James Bond? If not 007 himself, he could have easily been s Bond's older brother, less glamorous but as dangerous and deadly.

Taken touches on horrific but sadly existing and blooming business of international women trafficking, the slave trade of our times. Do not expect the movie make some serious social comments or provide the deep insight into the dirtiest business possible. Neeson's hero is not out to save thousands of lost forever young women, he is trying to find and safe one girl only who just happened not to know how lucky she was to have a deadly killing machine for a dad. I don't recall when was last time I felt as satisfied as when Bryan let disgusting and despicable villains of different social standings have it with great vengeance and furious anger. I saw perfectly clear all movie's weaknesses and clichs while I was watching it but it never bored me, it was non-stopping action, and it had a hero whom I desperately want to succeed. Perfect or not - I liked Taken a lot and would recommend it without hesitation.",1342310400,2,3214,4.464285714285714
5942080,3,B00ANT85VY,"This was a pretty good one, though like another poster said, Liam Neeson hasn't done any bad films, IMO. It is satisfying and exciting, especially since all the bad guys are preying on innocent girls. They deserve whatever they get, all of them, only more slowly. As with any kind of ""right vs wrong"" story, I wonder how those who started out as human beings, with hearts and souls, became so devoid of humanity that they would do these horrible things without blinking an eye.

The one thing that really really REALLY annoyed me was the exwife. She clearly had her issues with Neeson's character as a husband, and that was fine, but to see her take every opportunity to interfere and take verbal jabs and sabotage his relationship with his daughter was infuriating, as well as really bad parenting. No one in their right mind would just say, ""oh you want to go bebop around Europe alone, with no supervision of any kind? Sure let me sign the permission,"" without even having a moment to think about it. Of course IMO no parent in their right mind would let their teen daughter do it anyway. It seemed as though the exwife was willing to send their daughter into as risky a situation as she could, just to spite Neeson, with his concerns born of knowledge. I wanted her at the end to just say she was wrong, but all she would say was ""bring her back to ME,"" as though Neeson were merely the deliveryman, and had no real emotional stake in it. I thought it was pretty cold of the daughter to leave him alone at the airport as well. It seemed that both parents consisted basically of trying to outdo each other in giving the daughter everything she wanted, not stellar parenting there either.

While there was quite a bit of implausibility, the thing that got me was that the rich dudes at the auction would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for sex with a virgin girl? I mean, really? I am no expert on this but it seems to me that that is alot of money for something not that big a deal. It seems more likely to me that people would pay more for ""different,"" less mainstream sexual tastes.",1342310400,2,2092,4.431168831168831

His movies (The Fifth Element, From Paris with Love, The Transporter movies, Le Femme Nikita, The Professional, The Big Blue) are one's that i love to watch over and over.
 I only wish there were a lot more of Bryan Mills in the world so they could take out more of these scumbags who kidnap these girls, drug them up and have them turned into prostitutes, and once these girls are of no use to them anymore they throw them away like a piece of trash. All mothers and fathers of daughters need to watch this movie. I would never allow my 17 year old daughter to go alone with her friend and visit a country she doesn't know much about. I am just angered that this is still going on, human trafficking needs to be something of the past. Even in the United States we have human trafficking and this movie just opens peoples eyes to this disgusting trade.

Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.
----------------------------------------

**Brief Review**

I have loved watching Liam Neeson for some years now.  The man just makes great movies.  Hell, even 'Darkman' is pretty decent.  But he really SHINES in this feature.

**Movie Details/Some Spoilers Ahead**

The film centers around ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson).  A divorced man trying desperately to form a closer relationship with his daughter.  He ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) has long remarried, to a filthy rich man, and is not that worried about Neeson getting close to his daughter.

Well summer comes and Neeson's daughter desperately wants to go to Paris, to ""study"", yeah right...  Neeson must sign a parental consent form for her to leave the country unattended by an adult.  After much goading from Lenore and his daughter he relents.  He soon discovers though that she is actually going to Paris with her friend to follow the band U2 (or maybe it was Blink 182) around Europe.  He is furious about being deceived.

Neeson has been around to say the least and knows how dangerous the world actually is.  Well, his daughter is no more than 10 minutes off the plane in Paris when she and her friend are ""marked"" by some flesh peddlers.  These monsters steal women, and auction them off into sexual slavery.  Sad to say this is REAL, and something that the international police forces are trying to desperately combat.

As you probably have seen on the movie's trailer, Neeson is on the phone with his daughter when she is kidnapped.  And as you've seen off the commercials ""he has a particular set of skills..."".  He's a badass to say the least.

In no time at all Liam's on a plane to Paris ready to kill anyone who is between him and his daughter...

--Summing Up--

This film is HIGH on the action scale.  It is a tad slow for like the first 15 minutes, but after that never stops.  Plus the acting is superb.  Forget 'Ransom' with Mel Gibson, 'Taken' is the film to see.

There are very few people who have not seen this movie.  But if you are amoung the few who missed it, definitely check this out.

Is this worth buying.  ABSOLUTELY YES!!!  This is a re-watch times 10.  I have personally watched it apx 3 times, and will no doubt watch it again soon.  In fact just typing this review I am getting the urge to get my copy out and pop it into my aging DVD player.

Well, that's my 3 cents worth on this movie.  Wait, holy crap there's someone in my house, help me Liam!!!",1340323200,,2750,4.683438155136268
5942084,5,B00ANT85VY,"A retired CIA agent lets his ex-wife twist his arm into letting their daughter round all over Europe.  He warned them of the possible and we would not have a movie if the possible did not happen. Yep the daughter was abducted by a ruthless cabal or two to serve in an unsavory capacity.

""Let her go and you won't die."" Now how many movies have we heard that in? Well a lot. But Liam Neeson can run with the best of them. He fights the odds and so-called friends to shoot, drive, stab, and what not his way through Sleaze Town and more.

Will he succeed? Will we have fun kibitzing? Why do you find yourself sweating? Oh no you're going to watch it again aren't you?",1339891200,,666,4.1875

5942087,5,B00ANT85VY,"Believable, semi-logical, and well paced. Although it takes it to the extreme, people lack the patience and determination to think through scenarios and take into account multiple variables before acting.

Too often we act on emotions and don't care about possible consequences.

Life is not simply a random bag of occurrences. The eventual end comes from the decisions we make along the way. We can  change things if we see and plan.",1339372800,,434,5.0
5942088,2,B00ANT85VY,"This movie is pretty mild after having seen Hostel and its horrid sequel. It is also a much better movie. I hated the gore in Hostel. Taken was much more serious. Unfortunately, despite the good message it could have had, it was full of too many impossible situations. But in any case, I am glad I didn't see any of these three movies before going to Europe on my own at the age of 22.

The father (the former spy) is concerned about his daughter going to Paris. Understandable. He seemed a little over-protective. But he was totally balanced out by the mother who was completely unconcerned about anything and went so far as to help the daughter lie about her plans! ""She just couldn't tell him the truth,"" the poor girl. So museums aren't for everybody. Personally I find sculptures and ancient relics much more interesting than paintings. But I must ask: why would ANYONE travel to a foreign country just to pick up the first hot guy they see and follow a rock band around and go to parties and do other things they could just do at home? Oh yeah, ditzy teenagers.

Well, lo and behold, the daughter gets kidnapped, just like the father feared. And she happened to be on the phone with her father at the time. How lucky that he could record the incident! The movie wasn't bad up until this point but shortly afterward all the unbelievable things started to happen. Suspension of disbelief is one thing. But the guy was a former spy, not Superman.

*SPOILER ALERT*
The father goes to two different places where they are holding girls to turn into sex slaves. Naturally his daughter is not in either. He kills everyone he comes across and never gets one little scratch. Then he starts attacking everyone in his path just to get by them. He shoots this one guy's innocent wife just to get him to talk. He goes on this crazy car chase down the wrong side of the highway. Yeah, risk the lives of another innocent 50 people just to save one. Sorry, that's just wrong. Finally he finds his daughter. She wasn't at the other places because she was one of the special ones who was being sold to an individual buyer. Not just that, but they were ""saving the best for last."" Gee, what are the odds? Why, exactly? Well, she's American, and speaks English and French. Come on, she wasn't even that pretty. I think he didn't find her until the third place he looked because they needed to make the movie longer. Anyway, they capture the father. But even with his hands tied up, he manages to kill another ten bad guys. Yep, a Superman. So a little more drama, and then they come home, and all of a sudden he has his arm in a cast, even though he killed like 60 people without ever getting a scratch. This could have been a much more interesting story, if only it had been better executed. Or if it had been a superhero movie.",1339113600,2,2814,4.418111753371869
5942089,5,B00ANT85VY,"Great movie. The directors cut version is better, I say that because it has a little more revenge in it. This movie has some of the best lines ever spoken.",1339113600,,155,4.2
5942090,3,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson..is a superb actor. There is no debate. FACT. But seriously, even the most well trained 'security"" agent simply cannot ON HIS OWN, defeat an entire entourage of thugs. Would have been a little more realisiic if he had a partner working with him. I also notice a similiarity in this characters actions and kn owledge as a direct origin of the PERSON OF INTEREST lead character. There are a lot of things wrong in this film. the family he ""loves"" and is ""saving"" (his wife and daughter) are so spoiled you almos twant them to FEEL some pain of the real world. Very little information is given in this VERY brief 92 minute film of the true nature , organizational skills, methods, and sale destination of girls. Seems a very generic trip to the internet for 'facts. I personally know some young women overseas in Ukraine, latvia, who were trafficked last year.

5942091,5,B00ANT85VY,"An urban legend comes to life!  Young girls (and boys) should watch this as a precautionary tale to anyone who is going to travel abroad or domestic, or when you meet a stranger here or there.

Liam Neeson plays a semi absentee father who has been working as a highly trained operative on missions around the world.  His time away from home cost him his marriage, now his teenage daughter has asked through his ex wife to take a trip to Europe.  At first she tells him that they will be going to museums and doing touristy things, but he finds just before she leaves that they are really going to travel across Europe to see U2 on the European leg of their tour.  Reluctanly, he agrees (even though he is angry that his daughter and his ex wife lied about it to him) and signs the papers to allow her to travel.  In typical law enforcement manner, Liam demands that his daughter call and let him know where she is at all times.  His daughter and her friend, however, being the stereotypical flaky teenagers they are, say hello to a random stranger they meet at the airport.  He seems friendly enough, offers to share a cab to their destination, then gets their phone number.  Little do they know they are being lured into a trap.  And what a trap it is!  In a panic, his daughter tells her father on the phone that they are being kidnapped.  Liam immediately jumps onto a plane and heads to Paris to track his daughter down from the sex slavery ring she has been lured into.

The older I get, the more I see the signifigance of a story like that.  Having traveled abroad and been hassled and hustled by many a suave European man, be cautious.  You never know who is going to take you for a ride.  They may not be pulling you into sex slavery, but they are looking for something else.  And it also happens right here in the US, in your own backyard.  I have several friends in law enforcement, they question everything and anything I do.  ""DO you know that man you were talking to over there?"" ""Yes, I know him from ___"".  Paranoid?  It has merit.  A stranger is not just a friend you haven't met, you must be very careful with people with what you do and say, because you simply do not know what others are capable of or what they are after.  As a kid, you do not believe that people will treat you like a piece of meat, but they will.  Just wait until it happens to you.

Some words of criticism?  It was a bit hoaky that Liam would actually find his daughter with all the hoops he had to jump through.  Granted, he plays a spy who had access to certain information that the average person would not otherwise.  But, after all, this is entertainment about a not so pleasent subject.

Be warned, kids, the world is a crazy and dangerous place.  Be tough, street smart, and keep up a shield.  You will need it.",1337904000,,2809,4.293333333333333

5942094,5,B00ANT85VY,"TAKEN is a great movie to watch with your teenaged daughter. I have tried for a very long time to make my child understand that sexual slavery is alive and well so I don't have to worry *as much* that she will let herself get into a precarious situation. I've recounted numerous real-life human trafficking cases to her, went through the Polaris Project's website with her, showed her FBI statistics which show that selling girls is the 2nd most profitable criminal enterprise in the world (drugs is #1,) and still felt like I was talking to a brick wall. All I got in return were eye-rolls and infamous, I-am-the-invulnerable-teenager quotes like, ""Mom, you worry too much. I'm not stupid and that is soooo not gonna happen to me!""

Then we watched TAKEN... finally, finally, finally she is starting to get it!! This movie does an excellent job of showing how quickly traffickers work and how slick they are with little girls. It conveys the terror a girl is engulfed with when she's kidnapped, how easy it is to be kidnapped, the horrible sexual and physical abuse the victim suffers (without actually showing it,) and how the average little girl would never be found because they don't have a former spy (Liam Neeson) for a parent. After watching TAKEN my daughter's entire attitude has changed for the better. She is learning martial arts, staying cognizant of her surroundings, and is also more interested in the real-life cases she didn't want to hear about before. (An excellent non-fiction book to give your teenager to read after viewing this movie is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Slave-Next-Door-Human-Trafficking-and-Slavery-in-America-Today-With-a-New-Preface/dp/0520268660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Slave Next Door: Human Trafficking and Slavery in America Today, With a New Preface</a>&nbsp;- actually, everyone should read it.)

For those not interested in a mom's perspective and are reading reviews for the cinematic experience, TAKEN is a fast-paced thriller that snags your attention and keeps it the whole way through. The only truly unbelievable character in the movie is the mother, Liam Neeson's ex-wife. She's one of those TSTL (Too Stupid To Live) characters that thinks more like a know-it-all 16-year-old girl than a mature, grown woman. Luckily, she's just a side character and not in much of the movie overall.

5 stars! Definitely worth owning",1333324800,5,2428,5.417989417989418

5942096,5,B00ANT85VY,"I'm not a big fan of action movies. They tend to focus on violence and killing as many people as possible in the most original ways, but a select few have more depth. Taken falls into the latter category.

Why is it so good?

If you had told me that a 56-year-old actor would make one of the best action movies I've ever seen, I would have laughed and thought how bad Roger Moore's version of James Bond was in A View to a Kill and Octopussy. Action movies often feature actors who look the part, but who can't really act. Arnold Schwarzenegger springs to mind. Liam Neeson changes all that with this one performance. He doesn't look like he could take on the world, but his acting ability is so good that he convinces you that he's capable of everything he does in the movie.

Bryan Mills (Neeson) used to work for the government as a CIA operative. He still associates with friends from his previous job, but he's given up that career in an attempt to get closer to his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). She lives with his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and her rich stepfather. When Mills takes Kim a thoughtful gift on her seventeenth birthday, her stepfather gives her a horse. Mills doesn't seem to have a chance of winning her respect. What's more, Lenore apparently hates him.

Mills is given another chance to make a connection with Kim when she asks him to sign a consent form so that she can leave the country for a vacation. As she's 17, she needs the permission of both parents. Mills isn't happy about the idea. He's seen a lot of criminal activity in his former line of work and understands the dangers involved. Is he just being paranoid? His dire warnings seem exaggerated, but we soon see that they are justified.

Kim goes to Paris with her 19-year-old friend and trusts everyone she meets. The day she arrives, an Albanian gang take her and her friend captive. We learn that they intend to control her through drugs and turn her into a prostitute, or perhaps even sell her to a willing buyer.

Perhaps the best moment in the movie is when Mills talks to Kim's captor on her phone:

""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.""

He says it with absolute conviction.

I won't give away any more of the story. That setup takes around 25 minutes. If I have done a good job, perhaps you can understand why Taken is different. Mills is real. We understand his motives for giving up his job. When Kim is taken, we start to see some of the skills he claims to possess.

If she was your daughter, how would you react? What if you had the requisite skills to seek her out yourself? Is there anything you wouldn't do to save her?

Director Pierre Morel doesn't waste a single minute. At 93 minutes, the movie is lean and the action rarely allows us time to breathe once Mills kicks into action. He's a relentless killing machine, but, unlike most action heroes, his abilities seem authentic. To make things seem even more urgent, we experience everything from his point of view. Expect to see plenty of fast cuts during chase scenes, just as you would in The Bourne Trilogy.

It's easy to root for Mills because of the strong characterization. Neeson excels in this role and carries the movie throughout. I wonder if we'll start to see other good actors cast in action roles as a result? Taken is an enjoyable thrill ride with almost endless replay value.",1332633600,5,3778,4.381428571428572

5942099,4,B00ANT85VY,"""They kidnapped my daughter!"" I can't remember how many action movies start that way, including flicks with Bruce Willis, Steven Segal, Chuck Norris, and just about anyone else you could name. It's one of the most heavily used jumping-off points for getting the story going. So, since the basic premise is so well worn, what really matters is where the movie jumps to.

Neeson, with hair color not quite matching the lines in his face, does a great job as the wrong guy to mess with. He pounds his way through the seamy side of Paris with grim inexorability, from its grubby underbelly to the highest ranks of society and authority. As you might expect, the bodies of bad guys stack like cordwood. For all that violence, there's remarkably little visible bloodshed, but one or two moments seemed gratuitous. (Was that 'flesh wound' really necessary?)

If you're looking for a macho fantasy of righteous wrath, carried out by an implacable and seemingly indestructible loner, you came to the right place. You'll have to suspend disbelief for a while, but this movie's suspense repays the effort.

5942101,3,B00ANT85VY,"First of all it's a compelling action flick, albeit ridiculously unrealistic.  This movie portrays Dad as the Super-Hero to his daughter:  he's all-knowing, all-powerful, completely bullet-proof and one who beats the crap out of her many kidnappers.  I get the feeling that the Hollywood industry is chock full of divorced Dads who feel like failures to their children, and this movie is kind of an over-the-top fantasy to compensate.  OR the producers are targeting this film to middle-age Dads who feel inadequate, and/or the children who fantasize about having an all-powerfull protective father.  At any rate, this action fantasy certainly hits the psychological mark for the intended audience.  Liam Neeson is a perfect selection to portray the 50ish former CIA action guy who rescues his daughter from a ring of Albanian kidnappers and traffickers in young prostitutes, in France.  He's smart as well as tough, basically is invincible, beats up any number of pathetic bad guys, shoots a bunch more like Rambo, and doesn't get a scratch.  But, really, there's too much of this psychological ""Father Figure Worship"" going on here.  Even how the movie starts out, with Neesom hired to be a bodyguard to some cute young female pop singer.  She gives him attitude (""the Old Guy"" syndrome), then he saves her from a psychopathic fan, and of course she worships him.  What older guy wouldn't want to be idolized by a young, famous, attractive female?  So it starts out a little bit cheesy in that respect.  But this initial episode is just a forerunner to the real action when SUPERMAN DAD starts kicking Bad-guy butt!

The plot then moves on to the worldly, divorced Dad telling his 18-19YO girl (on a trip to France OK'ed by her Mother, travelling with a stupid partying friend) to be careful.  Under the influence from her dumb (and doomed) friend, she's not, and they get taken virtually seconds after they get off the plane.  A truly compelling scene is when she calls Dad (who's living in the US) on the cell from Paris, hiding under the bed as the Albanians enter their apartment, and then you hear a scream, a commotion, and some thug with a thick accent taunts Dad over the phone (this will come back to haunt the thug!).  As the cliche goes, it's ""Every Parent's Worst Nightmare!""

Superman Dad springs into action and tracks her down with a number of ingeneous moves, getting himself targeted by the French police in the process.  So Neeson's character has to track her trail through all of Paris while beating and killing many bad guys in the process, all the while avoiding the French police.  I.e. typical Hollywood super-spy stuff.  It REALLY taps into one's psyche: if YOUR daughter were kidnapped, could you save her with such ruthless and efficient aplomb?  Not a chance!  But our hero Liam Neeson can!  It is a good ride if you totally suspend your disbelief.

Now let's compare to REALITY for a second: the ultra-dangerous world South of our border where Mexico is now rated the WORST country in the world for kidnapping!  Literally hundreds of people a year get taken there, and how many of them get saved by their parents or even by the Law??  Not many.  Even Americans are getting kidnapped, because the cartels know that they can squeeze their family for $$$ before they kill them.  (Bet you didn't know this -- our pathetic media don't want to tell you for some reason!!!) It's a horrible scene.  I really wish that we could turn 100 Liam Neesons loose in Mexico to wipe out all the criminal murderers, torturers and kidnappers.  Let's dream on!  So to stoke your own revenge fantasies, all out there who have some deep emotional feelings about this sort of Evil (and kidnapping is truly Evil) should watch ""Taken"" and maybe you'll feel more inspired and less cynical about it than I do.",1329264000,,3811,4.788667687595712

5942107,5,B00ANT85VY,"I wish I could say that the plot of this film is contrived, unrealistic and would never actually happen to anyone in real-life. I really do wish that were the case.  Unfortunately, the opposite is true:  the plotline is about as accurate to what happens as a plotline can possibly be.  It sheds a light on a crisis of growing proportion in the world, yet one that gets all too little exposure:  human trafficking.

Bryan (Liam Neeson) is an ex CIA spook whose daughter is ambushed / kidnapped while on a trip to Paris.  Luckily for her (and unluckily for her captors!), his skills give him an unexpected advantage in tracking down the thugs who took her from him.  Bryan takes on the HT network with all the grace of a wrecking ball ramming into a 100 year old building!

Kidnapping for ransom is something that tends to only happen to the wealthy.  After all, kidnappers who are after $$ have little incentive to kidnap people who are of a modest financial worth.  Human trafficking, on the other hand, is an entirely different animal.  It can happen to anyone, anytime, as selling the person to a 3rd party is the objective, rather than selling the individual back to their family / friends.

For this reason, this movie is a must-see as it sheds a much needed light on an all too frequent egregious practice.  It points out how the culprits operate in preying on ""soft targets"" who are far from home.  I can honestly say that viewing this movie could actually save lives in the ""real"" world in which we live.",1326585600,,1511,4.527675276752768
5942108,2,B00ANT85VY,"I had very high hopes going into Taken, mainly because I think Liam Neeson is an amazing actor and has a reputation of participating in good movies (until recently -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clash-of-the-Titans/dp/B002ZG977Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clash of the Titans</a>&nbsp;and possibly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-A-Team/dp/B002ZG994U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The A-Team</a>). The first half-hour of the film was very engaging and the scene of the daughter's capture was intense. It stayed fairly intense for the rest of the movie, but my interest slowly declined from there, mainly because of the character progression of Neeson. Again, I will do my best not to spoil the movie for those who still have not seen it. In the beginning, Neeson is a very likable lead character. He portrays a credible father through the entire movie, there is no question about that. The problem arises when Neeson's daughter is taken and he assumes his role as ex-spy. Neeson throws away the good-natured, fatherly persona and becomes a violent James Bond-like figure, killing anyone and everyone that he sees. He almost becomes the bad guy in the film, lacking the qualities that set him apart from his enemies; basically becoming a mindless killing machine, especially by the end of the film. You still get the feeling that he'd do anything to get his daughter back, but you begin to wonder at what price. It's a pretty vengeful movie.

**Spoiler Alert**
The movie ends pretty quickly. Neeson finds where his daughter is, bursts in, guns blazing, and kills everyone in a matter of minutes. The thing that bothered me the most about this film is after Neeson gets his daughter back. They return to America and suddenly everything is back to normal and its like the whole thing never happened. Everyone's happy and wonderful and untraumatized. Sure, the daughter has a better relationship with her father, but other than that, nothing has changed from the beginning of the movie. I hated that! Annoyed the heck out of me. It's like they could have cut out everything in-between and you still would have had the same ending. Grrr.. never do that; completely takes away anything to be gained from the film.

As far as questionable content:
**Spoiler Alert** - The daughter is part of a large group of women that are being sold as sex slaves to foreign men, so you can imagine what the women are all wearing, or almost not wearing, during the bidding scene. There are a couple other scenes that deal with this content that are a bit risky.
**Non-Spoiler Alert** - The movie is a fairly violent film. Lots of shooting and hand-to-hand-to-knife combat stuff going on. So, be ready to see violence.
There is some profanity, but no ""F""-bomb. Because of the nature of the theft of the daughter, there are sexual references.

3. Kidnap daughter and daughter's friend (whose sole purpose in the movie--btw--is to die)
4. Go rescue daughter

Items 3 and 4 are the meat of movie and what give it its entertainment value...but the road you take to get there is so long and boring. For instance, there is a scene in the beginning where Bryan carefully picks out an inexpensive present for his daughter and meticulously wraps it. The director clearly demonstrates Bryan's love for his daughter, lack of funds and attention to detail with this one scene. That's enough for us to get the gist, but now we have to experience a BBQ with his buddies who regurgitate what we already know...and badger him into a small mission so he can get some money. It was 20 minutes of the movie that could have been completely removed. Liam MAKES this movie. He is so great! Without him, this flick would've gone straight to video.",1318464000,,1177,4.685990338164252
5942121,5,B00ANT85VY,"A weapon, by simple definition, is a tool used to protect one's self or others from harm.  The hero in this story is a living, breathing weapon who, in his own words, was a 'preventor' when he worked for the government in an obviously highly skilled special ops unit once the action starts.

The cost for his dedication and diligence was his family.  His wife left him and took their daughter, marrying a very wealthy business man who raises up his daughter as his little princess while the ex wife clearly allows her bitterness to show to their daughter.

So, when Neeson's character 'retires' to civilian life, all he has is a home movie of his daughter's last birthday under his roof, a single digit birthday where she gives a happy, adoring smile into the camera to show off her missing front tooth and blows out the candle on her birthday cake.  He has a single photo album in which he has a single photo from each of his daughter's subsequent birthdays until this one, her seventeenth.

He is a man who has the time to consider everything he does with purpose when it comes to his daughter and her happiness.  He keeps his distance from the ex and the new husband, but makes an effort to maintain a pleasant relationship with the man who is helping to raise his daughter in his stead. He obviously loves his daughter and she loves him, managing well enough not allow her mother's bitterness to cloud her relationship with her father, but as any teen would, she does use her mother's feelings to her advantage as we soon see.

As you watch the first few moments of the movie you get a picture of how lonely this man is, how much he sacrificed and while he does not regret that sacrifice, he does wish that he knew how to make things better, to re-establish a relationship with his daughter when she is on the cusp of adulthood and spreading her wings.

And her first act of spreading those wings is to go to Paris with her best friend to stay at the friend's cousin's home.  Now, because Neesom's character knows how ugly the real world is, he's not on board with this, especially with the way daughter and mom spring it on him the day after her birthday.  Because she is underrage they need his signature on paperwork to allow her to travel out of the country, and if Daddy doesn't approve, she can't go, so little missy turns on the water works and Daddy caves.  Unfortunately, when they arrive at the airport, he discovers that his daughter isn't going over to Paris for a simple vacation but they're following a band across Europe to attend all their concerts.

Angry at being lied to and against his better judgment, he allows his daughter to go on the trip and within an hour of the girls arriving at their destination, they are kidnapped.

His daughter happened to be away from the action with it first starts and she's on her cell phone with him, relaying what she's seeing through the window as her friend is being physically hauled out of the apartment.  His training kicks in and he's now a father and a highly trained special ops soldier and while he's telling his daughter what he needs to know in real time, he also has to tell her that there isn't going to be any way to stop her kidnapping.

The look on his face when he hears his daughter screaming for him makes you feel that moment right in the pit of your stomach and when the kidnapper picks up the cell phone after they take his daughter, he spells it out for them loud and clear:  I don't have money but I have a specific skill set.  You let my daughter go or I will hunt you down and kill you.

The bad guys think he's joking or blustering but he is serious and with the help of his old team and resources, he's on the move, heading to Paris and he starts with the creep at the airport who targeted the girls for the crew to kidnap and works his way up the foodchain.

He's been told his clock is 96 hours before he'll never be able to find his daughter and he's not wasting a second of that time playing nice or taking prisoners.  His daughter has been sold into a prostitution ring and he's not letting anyone who had any involvement in the organization off the hook.  He doesn't stop, he doesn't negotiate, he doesn't quibble, he's hunting for his daughter and every time another truly sleazy bad guy bites the dust you can't help but cheer for him.

The uncut version vs. the theatrical version is superior only in that you see him serving out the punishment these pigs deserve and it gives you a certain sense of satisfaction and justice that they don't prevail this time and they won't get a chance to victimize anyone else.

While there is a good deal of violence, it's not gory like a horror film, and there is alot of high intensity action that culminates in the rescue that you're holding your breath for.

It's a thrill ride and entertaining but it also has some clear lessons about the consequences of the choices we make.",1318291200,4,4913,4.408185840707965

5942130,3,B00ANT85VY,"""Quickly! There's no time!"" Review must start now!

Don't bother buying this version of the DVD as all you get is two versions of the movie--the theatrical release and unrated version. There are zero extras.

Having said that it's an entertaining thriller in which Mel Gibson...oops, I thought ALL movies where the dad gets angry and seeks revenge as a one-man team by himself starred Mel...it's Liam Neeson in this one.

Huge plot holes and improbable one man vs. everyone where (it's Hollywood, 'natch) all he suffers is a hurt wing in the entire movie but takes out approximately 9,555 Albanian (yes, Albanian!) criminals in Paris (yes, set that movie in a foreign locale to boost that overseas box office).

The dumbest plot device (or non-device) is the fact we are introduced to his three other ex-CIA buddies who now work security for a pop singer. Now, to me, rather than going it alone to Paris given he has only 96 hours to save his daughter from a life of white slavery, he only enlists one guy to do some research on the criminals who may be involved with the kidnapping of his daughter. You don't think these guys would take 96 hours out of their lives to help their buddy, if asked?

I just didn't get that. Why introduce these guys as his friends and have them bond at a backyard barbecue then on a job working security, then say bye bye. Did they not have enough in the budget to pay them all to fly to Paris?

Anyway, there are some cringe-inducing drugged out scenes of horror as young girls are forced into prostitution so fair warning those who don't dig needles, disgusting room conditions and the whole world of human trafficking. Other than that plenty of bad guy fu, explosions-a-go-go and all around non-stop action.",1314144000,,1741,4.636363636363637

5942135,5,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson is a government retiree who has devoted his life to his work. His ex-wife has since devoted herself to a new husband, and now Neeson attempts to reconnect to his teenage daughter. We get a glimpse of his prior life when former colleagues coax him into a security detail for protecting a pop star. With cat-like reflexes and skill he quickly dispatches an attacker and gets his star to safety.

Cynical about the world he worked in, Neeson is pressured by his daughter and ex to allow the girl to take a chaperone-free trip to the City of Lights. He is torn between his fear for his daughter's safety and losing a relationship with her by saying no.

The trip soon turns ugly when her daughter sees her friend being abducted from another room. She knows she is next and quickly calls her father on the cell phone he gave her. When the abductors find her she leaves the cell phone on and it is picked up by the abductor. The father offers a carrot and a stick. If they leave his daughter alone, he will forget their crime, otherwise he will find them and kill them. The abductor is foolish enough to say, ""good luck!"" before he hangs up.

When he arrives in Paris, the action really begins and there is a spike in metropolitan crime with what he does and what he learns.  A father is out to rescue his daughter and there is no time to spare. It leaves him no room for subtlety or diplomatic courtesies. The dialogue is intelligent and fast-paced, and Neeson is always convincing in whatever role he plays. In fact, you even forget the others except for the French inspector.

If you like to see death by Kleenex, where one person dies slowly over the course of the script, this is probably not your cup of tea. ""La Chocolat"" it is not. However, if you like to see a lot of strangers die violently throughout the movie than hold on to your black belt, because this is right up your alley.

""Taken"" should be borrowed or bought and watched. I've even watched it twice.

He is relentless, fierce, methodical and cold blooded as he dishes out the same level of pain and punishment practiced by those he pursues.

5942139,4,B00ANT85VY,"So says the films protagonist Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson)talking to his daughter's kidnapper over the phone. If you like your action straight up,no chasers,then Taken,released in Feb. 2008 and put onto DVD in /09,is THE film for you. Once the action starts,it's a hold-onto-your-seats thrill ride that never lets up.
The plot is pretty straightforward. An ex CIA special agent Bryan Mills is attending his daughter's birthday party. From the get go Mills we see is meticulous in his personal habits,all stemming from his background training. His CIA days are behind him but he still keeps in touch with some of his former close associates. His daughter Kim's(Maggie Grace)mother Lenore(Famke Janssen) has remarried and Bryan's relationship with her is quite strained. When Mills meets with his daughter and ex for lunch,Kim asks for his permission to go to Paris with her girlfriend. He is reluctant and he thinks about it. He eventually comes around and Kim is away,with a few stipulations her dad has made on her.
The two arrive in Paris and head for their rented flat. On the way they meet a nice looking young man who they arrange to attend a party with later on. While the two are unpacking some unknown men enter the apartment and Kim's friend is taken away in a big struggle. Kim has been talking on the phone with her dad and she describes to him in detail what is taking place. Frightened and barely hanging on, all due to her dad's calm demeanor/training,she hides in an adjacent bedroom under a bed. He tells her she will be taken but to leave the phone open as long as she can and,most importantly,he will come for her.
Kim is dragged away as Mills listens. Springing into action he contacts not only her mother but his old associates who offer some technical skills in obtaining background info on the kidnappers. Mills only positive lead is that he has heard the sound of one of the kidnappers. He flies to Paris and clandestinely enters the girls apartment. He tenders the help of an old Paris police detective which leads him nowhere. From the memory card of his daughters smashed telephone he garners a picture of one of her kidnappers. He tracks him down at the airport and just when it seems he has eluded Mills he gets killed by a passing truck.
Mills knows that an Albanian gang,specializing in human trafficking,is the group responsible for taking his daughter. This leads him to a construction site which also houses a brothel run by the gang. He puts a temporary stop to the place by almost completely demolishing the operation but in the process gets a lead in the form of a heavily drugged girl who has his daughters jacket. He takes her to a motel and dries her out and gets the address of the place Kim might be at. He poses as a French policeman there to renegotiate his ""fee"" to keep quiet about their operations and enters the den of the Albanian traffickers. While there he fingers the man whose voice he heard briefly on the phone and after some further""negotiations"", leaves with his man.
Using some plain old fashioned torture,he gleans the info that his daughter is now in the hands of a wealthy Parisian socialite who specializes in the sale of human flesh. Mills attends that function and poses as a waiter serving champagne. While in the small room with a buyer he finally sees his daughter,which he forces the buyer to obtain. While leaving the room to get his daughter(with the buyer in tow)the security there gets the best of him and his is held downstairs to be executed. Before they can do him in he is able to get free and turn the tables. He rushes out after his daughter who is now aboard a yacht owned by a wealthy Sheik. Through a car ride to beat all car rides he tries to catch up to the boat and eventually is able to jump aboard and overcome most of the security with all the usual lightening fast moves he has so far displayed throughout the film. He finally comes face to face with the Sheik holding his daughter at knife point. At the very moment the Sheik is about to negotiate with Mills,Mills shoots him dead with precision aim.
Daughter Kim safely back in his arms,they both fly home.
Famed French writer,director Luc Besson(The Fifth Element)uses a deft hand in his control here. The editing is top notch;no filler and all meat. The action once it starts,is breathtaking to watch as Mills' former ""training""/""special skills"" are something to behold indeed. Neeson is right in the zone throughout which adds that much more to the believability and intensity of the proceedings. The supporting cast is great and the stunt work wonderful.
Technically is the film has been transferred onto DVD in its original 2:40:1 a/r,and is clear and crisp. This version has both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film. There is commentary,the trailer and a making of featurette. There is however something the buyer should be aware of and it is in the making of the DVD itself. There is a scene where Mills enters the Albanians lair(behind the red door).He presents a card to one of the kidnappers. At that moment there seems to be a layer change and the film briefly stops ans starts. This is a common thing but here the sound actually goes out of sync with the actions/mouths on screen. I have checked this on a couple of players and it does it on both. It's a manufacturers glitch and should have been taken care of but of course these things never are unless the release is successful enough to warrant a future re-release. Gotta love this industry don't you?
All in all a top notch effort by all involved. Neeson is the intense protagonist who you just KNOW is going to get his man,or in this case his daughter. We know the ending before it really gets going but the trick is to sit back and enjoy the ride,and what a ride it is. 4 1/2 stars,recommended viewing.",1309132800,,5815,4.624758220502901

5942141,1,B00ANT85VY,"No.  Judge Dredd is the worst, but TAKEN easily moves into second place.  The writing, editing and acting are all atrocious and manipulative.

The movie starts with a montage of a father flipping through pictures of his daughter as a child, a banal attempt to set up an emotional connection with the viewer, which utterly fails for anyone over the age of about six.  More failed emotional blackmail follows as the father buys a present for his daughter, then takes it to her birthday party (and proceeds to make an ass of himself, to show us how 'tough' he is and will be), while the movie tries to show us the father is the 'good' parent and the mother is a bitch.  Daddy gives the present to his daughter, she loves it, then rich step dad brings out a horsie for the little girl (she is 17).  Spoiled little rich girl drops daddy's present and runs to the horsie.  I almost cried.  No, make that almost retched.  Daughter is going to Paris and Daddy has to sign a form allowing her to travel out of the country?  Really, could this possible be true?  He's opposed but gets emotionally blackmailed into allowing her to go.

To cut to the chase, once in Paris Daddy's little virgin is kidnapped by Albanian sex slavers and Daddy, ex-covert ops superman, goes on a rampage to save her.  The movie, previously attempting, and failing, to set us up to care about these flat, lifeless characters now goes all out into ""Die Hard"" mode.  Daddy finds daughters hotel room, actually talks to the kidnappers (WTF!) and finds a camera.  He takes the camera to a photo booth, inserts the memory card and instantly finds a pix of daughters kidnapper in a reflection in one of the pix.  How does Daddy know this guy is the kidnapper?  Because Daddy is SUPER SPY!  This is the first of many unbelievable plot contrivances that take up the entire rest of the movie.  Daddy now goes to the airport, finds the guy (who is wearing the exact same highly recognizable clothing) and proceeds to chase him through the streets outside of the airport, causing massive vehicular mayhem the whole time.  Bad guy gets away, only to stand on a highway and get smashed by a truck.  No Paris police or airport security seem to care that Daddy is causing dozens of car wrecks while doing this as the movie simplistically moves us on to the next scene without any problems for Daddy, not even a traffic ticket.

A couple of scenes move us forward, one in which Daddy talks to a buddy who just 'happens to know' that it is Albanians who are totally in charge of kidnapping beautiful girls for sex slaves in Paris.  He then meets up with an old French police buddy who gives him some additional info to move the plot forward a bit.  Since Daddy has lost his source to find the Albanians (got smashed by a truck) he goes to a Rue where streetwalkers hang out and talks to one of the girls.  He acts like an a** and of course one of the Albanians is watching, walks up to Daddy to get rid of him.  Daddy places a wireless bug on bad guy (he has an Albanian interpreter with him) and finds out where the bad guys hang out.  Daddy goes to a construction site where he finds the bad guys selling girls to the construction workers.  His daughter isn't one of them so he goes on his first rampage, killing dozens in a stupid and unbelievable car chase, once again with no Paris police caring at all that their city is being shot up.  At one point he is in a car with a girl he taken with him.  A bad guy car is right next to them and the bad guys are firing automatic weapons directly into Daddy's car.  Is Daddy or the girl hurt?  Noooo!!!  Why?  Where did all the bullets go?  Who knows?  Who cares?

Moving forward a bit, Daddy once agains finds another bad guy hideout (how?  don't know and don't care) and presents himself as a Paris detective.  Does Daddy speak French?  Noooo!!!  Do the bad guys speak English?  Yesss!!!!  Does anyone care?  Noooo!!!!  Daddy proceeds to blow away all these bad guys, after recognizing the voice of one of the bad guys as the same person he spoke with on the phone.  Really?  Who cares anymore.  Stupid plot contrivance abound.

Daddy now finds out his old Paris police buddy is protecting the bad guys (another unbelievable plot contrivance) and goes the detectives house to confront him.  Detective refuses to help (he needs the money the bad guys pay him) so Daddy shoots the wife (sample line: ""It's only a flesh wound"") to get the cop to talk.  Of course, the cop's two kids don't run out to see what happened when their mother was shot, they are asleep in bed.  The copy tells Daddy where to go next.  After all, the plot is so thin and stupid that someone is always telling Daddy exactly where to go, or he figures it out himself somehow.

Daddy next goes to a fancy dress ball/party where he once again presents himself with his fake French Police ID, which of course totally gets him instantly into the party without him speaking a word of, um, what is it?  Oh yeah, French.  Daddy spots the bad guy.  How does he know that this one guy in a tux out of hundreds of guys in tuxes is the bad one?  Who cares!  He knows, he just knows.  Follows the bad guy into the basement where pretty young girls are being sold in an auction.  Of course his daughter is there, is the prize of the sale and Daddy buys her (don't ask how) only to get caught.  Bad guys prepare to kill Daddy but he is SUPER DADDY so he proceeds to kills off another dozen guys with guns without him getting even winged.  After he kills all but one bad guy he shoots him a couple of times to get him to say where is daughter has been taken.  Where?  Another actual line from the movie ""There's a boat, on a quay.""  And that's all the info Daddy needs, because this is Paris and after all, how many boats on how many quays can there be in Paris (I'm guessing several thousand on several hundred)?  In typically stupid fashion, Daddy kills another bad guy, runs outside and sees the limo carrying his daughter and proceeds to chase it for several miles through the streets of Paris.  Any cops around?  Don't be silly, of course not.  And how does he know that this particular limo is carrying his daughter?  Who cares, he knows this is the limo leaving the party (out of dozens) which has his daughter.

After more vehicular mayhem, Daddy jumps from a bridge onto the luxury yacht, proceeds to kills a dozen more bad guys without a scratch, then kills the middle eastern sheik who is holding a knife to his daughter's throat.

And they all live happily ever after!!!!!

5942144,5,B00ANT85VY,"I was working in Paris in 2007 at the American Embassy, and when I was leaving work one day during the summer...I happened to bump into Liam Neeson, and paid him a compliment on ""Batman Begins"".  He was very nice, and actually struck up a short conversation.  I asked him what he was doing here, and he said that he was working on a movie called...yep--""Taken"".
  I remembered that about seven months later, when this movie premiered in France (I don't believe that it reached the States until almost a year later).  In many ways, the story has been redone in many different forms--Mel Gibson's ""Ransom"" in the '90s; I even believe there was a George C. Scott variation in the late 1970s.
  Lack of originality does not go hand-in-hand with lack of entertainment, however.  If you combine Luc Beeson's knack for high-adrenaline action with Neeson, who is a LONG human being (IMDB lists him at 6'5""--I think they're a couple of inches SHORT) who certainly hasn't been afraid of taking big dramas (Schindler's List) or over-the-top action (Darkman, of course)...and the mix ends up pretty good.
  Neeson pretty much carries the film.  Love Maggie Grace as the daughter Neeson's Bryan Mills wishes to establish a relationship with, Famke Janssen--looking slightly older, but still a knockout--as the ex-wife who wishes the ex-husband would go away...until the daughter gets kidnapped in Paris; Xander Berkeley as the richer, more stable second husband who GETS OUT OF THE WAY when Neeson's Brian Mills goes on the warpath; Leland Orser and Jon Gries as coworkers in Mills' former life...
  But this is Neeson's film from the start, and he gives many sides to Bryan--the father who never forgets his daughter's birthday or misses an opportunity for her to pursue her chance to sing, the estranged ex-husband, the ""preventer"" when working in a bodyguard team for a singer (nice quick turn there, Holly Valance), the badgered male when the daughter wants to go to Paris--and the mother browbeats him into signing off on it...and last but not least, the ex-covert operations operative that goes medevial when his daughter is kidnapped by white slavers in Paris.  The movie's catch phrase--the whole line that Neeson delivers leading up to the ""I will find you, and I will kill you"" line is, in many ways, the early 21st century equivalent to Clint Eastwood's ""Do you feel lucky?  Well, do you...PUNK??!?"" speech from ""Dirty Harry"".
  Sure, the premise isn't original; and the characterizations are sort of staid.  But Neeson carries this movie, both with his emotional input and his physical presence.  Combine it with Beeson's take on action in movies...and we end up with a pretty good ninety minutes.  Highly recommended.",1307404800,3,2717,4.969026548672566

5942148,4,B00ANT85VY,"Parents, if you're tempted to allow your teenagers to travel on their own to Europe, watch Taken before you decide. Today's Europe is a far cry from the romantic picture that many Americans still imagine. Bad things can and do happen to naive teens arriving for an adventure.  Having visited France, the setting for Taken, several times in the past decade, I can say firsthand that this country has been inundated with emigres from eastern Europe, and not all of them are innocents in search of freedom. Organized crime has assumed a new face with new mobsters, and in some cases, the newcomers are more ruthless than the natives.

The plot of  Taken centers upon a former CIA agent Bryan Mills, portrayed by Liam Neeson, whose daughter is off on a European jaunt, only to be victimized by Albanians eager to sell her virginal charms to the highest bidder.  Film maker Luc Besson, whose rep was made by  such action thrillers as  La Femme Nikita, ramps up the tension by having the abduction take place during a phone call from father to daughter, during which he coaches her to feed him vital info about the thugs. When one of them picks up the cellphone, Mills warns them to release his daughter or face his considerable, professional wrath. Of course, they blow off his warning. But two days later, he's onto them, and never, ever lets go.

Neeson displays his physical side, literally mowing down anyone who stands in his way with an arsenal of awesome martial arts moves and laser-eyed shooting ability. Keep in mind that I normally abhor films with brutal scenes of torture and endless chase scenes. I've recently read a lot, however, about sex trafficking, and have to admit that I was rooting for Mills to turn up the electricity and take out those SOB's. Much of the action is totally implausible, but the crime is so heinous that I don't care. Neeson brings a knife edged, single minded, merciless sense of purpose to this role,  and while the daughter and her mother are mindless social twits, it's hard not to pull for him every hard-won, a** kicking step of the way.",1305158400,3,2079,4.676712328767123
5942149,4,B00ANT85VY,"The movie Taken was very good. The action sequences were very good and the acting was decent. The movie is about a retired guy named Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson) who's trying to retire. His daughter goes to France with her best friend and she gets kidnapped. I will not say anything more about the storyline of the movie. But  I would like to say this though. The movie is pretty disturbing once you find out what happened to his daughter and why. I won't spoil it in how it was disturbing but I would say that people ages 15+ could see this movie. But if younger viewers would want to see the movie, than I reccomend them watching it on a clearplay filtering system which would take out the sexual stuff and more disturbing violence.(for more info, go on clearplay.com), THank you for reading my review.",1304985600,,800,4.517241379310345
5942150,4,B00ANT85VY,"Most people love it and a few hate it and both sides have valid points.  Viewed purely as an action movie it does what it says on the tin!  If you want to start analysing it as if it was an art house film then, of course, you can find fault because clichs do abound.  First off there's the air-headed 17 year old daughter, Kim, doted on by the ex-CIA specialist killing machine played efficiently by Neeson, who's been cast aside by the blinkered, indulgent mother, played by Janssen, for the safer and much richer second husband, Xander Berkeley.  Next, Kim decides she wants to do the groupie thing with her equally air-headed mate and troll around Europe after a rock group.  Naturally, doting father, who knows the ways of the world, fiercely objects but dumb mum sees no problem with this - after all, you're only young once!

The girls reach Paris safely, the first stop on their tour, but fall foul to the most horrible of scams.  Enter the East European nasties!  This is the bit, of course, that plays in to the most profound of our prejudices about the yellow peril, going back to such pernicious heavies as Dracula himself; the peril from the east!  This time, though, it's not Transylvania getting the bad press but the Albanian mafia, trafficking young women for prostitution, and Kim and her mate fit the bill nicely.  Dad duly brushes the dust from his skill set and proceeds to track down the kidnappers killing anything and everything in his way, with apparent impunity.

So what's the problem?  The action is handled brilliantly and, whilst the inevitable fight scenes do stretch the boundaries of probability, the baddies well and truly get their just deserts.  Just think about this: if your daughter was snatched and sold into slavery to be the sex toy for some rich sheik and you were a CIA trained killing machine with powerful financial resources available to you would you let anything stand in your way to rescue her?  Of course not! So the premise is fine: the baddies have to come from somewhere so why not let Albania have its turn; there have been plenty of nasty Brits - think, Die hard?  And as for the many improbabilities - it's fiction for crying out loud: albeit fiction, which has, unfortunately, echoes of the sometimes, very unpleasant real world.

He plays a father whose daughter has been taken and he needs to use his special skills to recover her in the next few days before he loses her forever. Though there are many killings in this movie they are for the most part quick and impersonal.

Neeson acquits himself impressively as a no-nonsense action hero. The unrated director's cut remains preferable to the studio-imposed PG-13 edit.

5942157,4,B00ANT85VY,"ust actually got around to watching this and it turned out to be a pretty good soild action film. For fans who like Bourne Indentity and ""24"" this will fit in just fine. The central character is played by a great actor Liam Nelson whose past involves ""The Goverment"" using his ""special skills"". He's given that up since his world revolves his daughter which is now living the life of the rich & famous thanks to her mom. The daughter has no clue what dear Dad use to do.

Daughter decides a trip to ""France"" is needed and from there it's one pissed off Dad (Liam Nelson) becoming  one-man wrecking crew in order to save his daughter who has been kidnapped for selling on the human market. In a race against time (96 hrs before she's gone off the grid) Nelson enacts a ""24"" tempo and lets nothing get in his way. At each turn it seems the world of Human Slavery and underworld prostituion becomes more evil and dark. For anyone who is a ""Dad"", you want to cheer Nelson on to just ""kick-the-crap"" out of every single one of them which he gladly does.

The film is visually solid with a nice DTS track to it. The fight scenes (which are plenty of) actually does produce some nice low end along with some gun battles. It's not say Rambo sound but the hand-to-hand combat scenes really do sound and look good. I'm giving it 4 of 5 Stars but on a scale of 1 to 10 it would be a 8.8.

Oh, and the expenditure of countless rounds of ammunition, and a jump from a bridge to a boat, perfectly timed after speeding thru streets and causing untold collateral damage.

5942165,5,B00ANT85VY,"I am a fan of Liam Neeson, I just believe his charisma in front of a camera is cool no matter what movie it may be. The trailer of the movie caught my attention right away, the story may be a little thin but the action and constant pace of the film will keep you tuned in.

Taken is a story about a CIA retiree named Brian Mlls who is a father to a 17 year old girl with ex-wife who remarried a rich man. The connection between the mother and father is very disjointed, they don't agree on everything and their only conenction they have with each other is the daughter. The daughter decides to go on a trip to Europe with a friend and ends up getting kidnapped and trafficked, being sold as a prostitute to a slum lord and now the father must use of all of his acquired skills as a CIA agent and try to rescue his daughter before it is too late.

Now while the story may be very simple, it is the action that is truly entertaining to watch. Liam Neeson may be old but he can still whoop some serious ass. His character is relentless and will kill anyone that will get in his way of saving his daughter. Liam Neesons character is pretty damn resourceful and highly intelligent, I would say that this is basically another ""Bourne"" type movie but with a more mature protagonist. While it may seem this character is just a murderer in every sense (I would say he kills about 30 people in this movie) its the drive that comepletly makes the viewers overlook all of the violence and just root for Liam hoping he finds his daighter in the end.

Then I bought a Blu Ray player recently and decided I would not re-buy Blu Rays of all of my DVDs except for a select few that I watch most of the time. Naturally, Taken was one of those movies so I bought the Blu ray disc. Unfortunately the picture quality in some scenes, notably night scenes, seem to actually be worse than the DVD version. The night scenes have more grain to them and there are scenes where there is a distinct horizontal line through the middle of the screen where the colors are actually different above and below the line. This is most notable in the night scenes. I even exchanged the Blu Ray thinking there was no way they would actually release that and the disc must be defective, but the replacement is exactly the same way. I compared scene by scene on the same blu ray player the blu ray and DVD and actually recommend the DVD version of the film. Sure, the day scenes are not as crisp as the Blu Ray, but it is more than made up for in the night/dark lighting scenes. If this movie was my only impression of blu ray movies, I would steer clear, but fortunately, I know blu ray is generally a much better media than DVD.

So, in summary, unless this Blu Ray is much cheaper than its DVD counterpart, I would recommend the DVD over the Blu Ray. 5 star movie, 1 star Blu Ray.",1297209600,,1470,4.212765957446808

In essence, you feel his pain, his sense of potential loss, and the calm he must exude to persevere through the emotional entanglement that now has been thrusted into his lap.

There are tons for Christmas, Thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day and even Guy Fawkes Day got V For Vendetta. Who would've guessed that Liam Neeson of all people, would bring us seemingly the only Father's Day movie, and make it a great one as well? Ok fine, the movie doesn't quite have anything to do with the holiday, but this is such a movie for dads that it might as well be, and will definitely be one I start watching yearly every June. I'd also like to state that this totally clears Liam's name from The Phantom Menace as well.

Bryan Mills is a former Special-Ops agent, who describes his former title as a 'preventer' when he was overseas. He now lives in Los Angeles to try and reconnect with his daughter Kim, who lives with her mom and her new husband who's pretty much rolling in money. Bryan is very protective of Kim, and wants what's best for her, and even tries to get a pop singer he bodyguards one night to help Kim out since she wants to be a famous singer. But one day, against her dad's wishes, Kim takes a trip to Europe with her not-so-smart friend Amanda, and things go wrong almost immediately. When they make it to their hotel, their room is broken into by strange men who take Amanda, while Kim sees the whole thing from her window in another room, while at the same time talking to Bryan on her phone. Terrified, she tells him what's going on, and he tells her that she's going to be taken, and to list as much info about the captors as she can before they nab her. One of the men picks up the phone while Bryan's listening, and Bryan gives them a bone-chilling warning that he's coming for them, and that he -will- kill them if they don't let her go immediately. The man simply answers with 'good luck' and hangs up. With his connections from his old job, Bryan takes after them right away, and won't stop at anything or anyone that gets in his way, regardless if they've helped him in the past.

Normally, I get bored with the 'one man army' kind of action movie, but not here. Taken is so well done that the movie never drags on, and even when it seems like it's going to get to a boring moment, something new happens, and we're at a new scene. The pacing is so perfect, and the first time I watched it, I couldn't believe the movie was over because it went by so fast and smoothly. Liam does a fantastic job as Bryan, an effective force of a man who realistically and brutally dispatches of his enemies. A lot of the moves Liam does in the movie are very practical moves from martial arts like Wing Chun, and nothing ever gets fancy. When a move works and takes out the opponent, it's over for them, and he doesn't keep going to the point of overkill. It was nice. I was emotionally attached to his character, and wanted him to bust the bad guys in the worst way possible for taking Kim, and even more after seeing what was being planned for her. What makes the movie work is that Bryan isn't a monster who can't be stopped. Sure, he plows through enemies, but he's not brainless- he is very much human, and the audience can relate to him, and might even let his actions slide because of the circumstances. Compare Liam, who's nearly 60, to a slightly older actor like Sylvester Stallone and usually plays the same character in his action movies, and you'll see a clear difference between the two, and how it's easier to like one more than the other, and how Taken isn't exactly like the other shoot/beat 'em ups out there.

Unfortunately, the blu-ray doesn't look that great, and that's a big surprise considering how much of a surprise hit the movie was. Some colors are too faded while others are over saturated, some deep black look a bit green, and there's even some grain in a couple of scenes. It's a shame because this movie could've looked great on the right set up. The audio's much better at least, a Dolby 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, and Spanish and French tracks in Dolby Digital 5.1. Everything sounds strong and nearly perfect here. I actually re-watched a few chapters when I first got the blu-ray, before letting the movie finish, because they sounded so good.

The special features are robust, but a mixed bag, starting with the international edition cut of the movie, which has a bit more violence than the regular version. You'll probably just end up watching this one and ignore the regular cut. There's a commentary track in French with the director and cinematographers that only the biggest fans of the movie should check out since reading a commentary track is never that fun. It's definitely informative, but there's another commentary track with co-writer Robert Mark Kamen that's just as good. Le Making Of is your typical set of interviews with the cast/crew, going on about how great it is to be working on the movie. There's also a little bit of footage from the premier of Taken, though it's more on the promotional side. Black Ops Field Manual is a useless extra that shows where the characters are as the movie progresses, and finally are trailers and a story board comparison. Basically, nothing too exciting for casual fans of the movie, and the only thing worth checking out if you have time is the commentary with Robert.

I also love this movie because it highlights a topic we often like to ignore-- human trafficking.  This movie follows a father who is using his former skills as a U.S. government ""preventer"" (aka some type of special secret service) to track down his kidnapped 17 year old daughter in Paris, France.  His relationship had been strained with her and her mother for most of the daughter's life because of his job, and now he is using those same career skills to find her.  He only has a short window of time before she will disappear forever.  Liam Neeson is intense, and the action is so real.  He is an intelligent trained killer and will stop at nothing.  This is one of our favorites that we love to see again and again.

Trust me.  Paying a few extra dollars for the Blu-ray is worth it!!!",1293753600,,1188,4.410138248847926
5942181,5,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson delivers a tight, solid and entertaining action movie in ""Taken."" His lack of empathy for the bad guys, even as weep and whimper upon breaking, is satisfying to watch.",1293667200,,179,4.806451612903226
5942182,4,B00ANT85VY,"'Taken' was originally advertised as a sort of mystery thriller about a kidnapped girl and a father who is out to rescue her, similar to Mel Gibson's 'Ransom' from over a decade ago. First thing's first - this is NOT that type of movie, and that probably is a good thing, as the advertising was genius as it seemed to draw just as many women as men, yet in the end, it would be the men that would be most satisfied.
'Taken' is really your run-of-the-mill action movie, starring Liam Neeson in an pretty standard performance as an ex-CIA father who let's his somewhat shy, pretty and fairly dorky 17 year old daughter take a vacation to Paris (played by Maggie Grace who by the way puts on a very adorable performance), yet upon arrival his daughter gets kidnapped by a gang of sex-trafficking hoodlums. Neeson's characters knows this during a pretty intense, well shot and greatly written scene as he talks on the phone to his daughter as she is being kidnapped, then boldly utters the movie's tagline: ""I will find you, and I will kill you."" Up to this point, all performances are fairly stale, especially Neeson's, but what Neeson lacks in character drama he COMPLETELY makes up for as a one-man Rambo martial arts action hero. It's surprising to see someone of his age basically go all around Paris beating the living snot out of just about everyone. And I do mean everyone.

There really is no sense of mystery or intrigue as the plot is pretty straightforward and linear (to a sometimes disappointing degree), but through the good cinematography work and talented editing, it makes this physically appear more intelligent than it actually is (at only a 90 minute length, do not expect anything epic). There were some good opportunities for good plot twists that were never taken advantage of in any way, and although this is somewhat disappointing watching the film as a critic, the action, fighting, fast cars and Liam's completely bold, relentless, almost completely inhuman I-will-do-ANYTHING-to-get-my-daughter no-nonsense character will probably turn you off as much as it turns you on. He doesn't care about being a hero, he hurts and kills ANYONE who will get in his way, and the average macho-rebel wannabe will love every second of it.

Personally, I found this movie to be incredibly entertaining, and while you don't need much intelligence to watch this movie (even though at the outset it seems you will), it really doesn't matter, the bottom line is you'll be entertained just as I was. This is one of those movie's perfect for a Friday night with friends or family (well, those over 14 as there are some fairly sexually graphic scenes of kidnapped, drugged and sex-trafficked young women and men taking advantage of the, minus any nudity though, but it does come fairly close at a couple of points), it's also a movie that can be watched over and over again.

which have very little credible story line, at times poor acting, and usually
what story line it has wriiten around senseless violence with very little purpose

this movie has a good story line, a good cast, violence where needed for story

for the action and/or story line to move on. The only real thing I can imagine
that other reviewers may not like with this movie, is the lack of gore, which
is another thing that makes this movie so good. It's well worth the aasking price

5942188,1,B00ANT85VY,"Picked this up because I like Liam Neeson, but boy, this was poor.

It starts off eerily similar to an early ""24"" episode (indeed, even the daughter's name is Kim) - This time, an ex-government agent's daughter is kidnapped, and dad uses his spy skills to rescue her and take the bad guys down.

Unfortunately, it stayed in ""24's"" implausible mode, so I stuck with it for the yucks.

Along with the bad dialog, some of my favorites:

-Liam Neeson's anal guy character studying what looks like the actual, folded karaoke machine manual (no, not some hardcopy he printed off a website) before he buys the thing. Must be some type of spy skill.

-Liam Neeson's character going to great lengths to acquire an Albanian interpreter, but check it out - virtually everyone in the film speaks better English than the interpreter.

-All of the bad guys are out of the 1960's James Bond school of sterotypical villans, especially the fat letch shiek on the yacht.

-Kim, of course, ""the best for last"", gets auctioned for a really, really high bid. Ha-ha. Dad's high bid. Ah, ha-ha-ha.

-The guys on the letch sheik's yacht somehow know that it's Kim's dad that is after them (the dead guy that sold her to him must have taken the time to warn them before he was offed). Orders are to kill Liam Neeson's character -'if necessary'. Maybe he'll listen to reason?

-The whole sappy bookend spiel about the rock singer girl - was waiting for evreryone to start singing ""Kum Ba Yah"" at the end...",1292716800,5,1480,4.6183206106870225

I understand you don't look to movies like this for realism, but it's hard to believe that the French authorities wouldn't have some interest in taking action if a couple of American teenagers had been kidnapped.

5942192,4,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson impresses all in Taken. When he took part in this film, he was around 55-56 years of age, and to see someone as old as him in good, fit condition to perform some of the stunts...it's quite an amazing feat. He plays a retired CIA agent, trying to reconnect with his daughter that the stressful job has kept him away from for many years. If there's one thing Bryan Mills (Neeson) hasn't missed, however, is his daughter Kim's (Maggie Grace) birthday. Every year, no matter what, he'd be there, he'd buy her a gift. Mills had split with his wife, who had re-married into a rich family, and Kim's been under their custody. Following her 17th birthday party, Kim wanted to go see a band tour in Europe, and reluctantly, Bryan agrees.

This is where things get interesting. It reminds me of the game, Heavy Rain's tagline, ""How far would you go for the ones you love?"" During the trip, Kim and her friend Amanda get kidnapped by a crime organization specializing in drugs and extortion of female teenagers. Luckily for Kim, she was on the phone with her father at the time of the kidnapping, and managed to give him a few key details on the situation, clues in which he uses to find her. The action gets intense as the film goes on, with car chases, hand-to-hand combat, and shoot-outs, in typical action format. What makes this film stand out more than the generic action 'X' films, though, is the goals and acting performances. The plot helps back up Neeson's edge to find the daughter, showing that he'd do whatever it took to get her back, including shooting a former friend's wife...pretty crazy, but you can't help but side with Neeson's character, I'm sure any parent who has even but an ounce of care for their children would do the same if in that particular situation.

I know action films include Supermen, and Neeson plays a Superman here, but the badassness of it all overshadows the impossible bits, heh. I really liked the plot of this movie. It shows possibilities, in today's world, I wouldn't be surprised if extortion of this caliber has occurred. But really, Neeson's perfomance is phenomonal, and this film has even appealed to non-action fans that I've shown it too. Highly recommend it. I'd give it a perfect score but I was slightly disappointed by the lack of human flaw in the movie. Still, superb action-packed, suspense-thriller.",1291593600,,2363,4.691566265060241

I believe if I saw this movie before I had any kids, I would've rated it 3 stars.  The movie is too perfect in setting up Liam Neeson's character to be sympathatic.  Also, he's overly protective which crosses into obsessive paranoia.  Anyway, this has got to be high on the Father's Day gift list for now.  It's fun and gratifying.  I've seen the non-extended cut on cable and the only difference is the extended cut has a bit more ""oomph"" in violence in key scenes which adds a lot to the character.  Get it dad.

5942195,4,B00ANT85VY,"Taken surprised me. I thought it might be good, but I didn't realize how good. Taken is harsh, intense, prejudicial, and it packs a not-so-subtle punch.

If the Star Wars series wasn't qualification enough, Liam Neeson has now stepped into the ranks of the finest action heroes. He is superb in the role. The stunt work and car chases rank with Bourne or better.

I won't go into descriptive plot details, except to say -- nothing could be more primal to the gut than to have your own daughter kidnapped. On this premise, ex-spy-operative Bryan Mills (Neeson) is now granted a  license to leave a trail of dead bodies in his wake as he conducts a vengeful search for his kidnapped 17 year old daughter in the most corrupt dens of Paris.

Mill's rampage seems justified, and throughout this amped-up movie I found myself screaming ""DO IT!"" as he slaughtered one bad guy after another. The unrelenting drive and ingenuity of Mills as he races against time is what makes this movie so interesting.

Still, while my lower brain gleefully submits to the revenge killing, my conscience is disturbed. This film also happens to be perfect to show to future troops the US Government would send into the Middle East or Eastern Europe, with the troubling, simplistic message ""Keep our children safe.""

""Taken"" implicitly concludes that torture and murder are OK (in fact, ultra-cool) in the commission of a rescue; in other words, the end justifies the means -- Which seems to be the intrinsic, inescapable, primal message of Taken. And there is a strong thread of xenophobia against brown-skinned people that for me sends up a red caution flag.

It's evil subplot of a criminal culture that is auctioning young girls for prostitution is also reminiscent of the earlier 1970's film, ""Prime Cut.""

A very enjoyable thriller, but with no-so-nice political and racial overtones.",1288915200,,1864,4.895238095238096
5942196,5,B00ANT85VY,"It's rare to find a film like ""Taken"" nowadays.  In a world overcrowded and over-saturated with action films, ""Taken"" may appear to be simply another ""run of the mill"" style of films found within the genre.  However, this assumption couldn't be any more wrong.  The truth is that ""Taken"" is a truly deep, emotional, and inspiring film that depicts what one man is willing to risk, and do, in order to save the ones he loves.  The story is well developed, and the characters are easily likable, making the film that much more enjoyable.

The film revolves around the tale of ex CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) who is currently working as a security guard for a major musical star by the name of Sheerah, a pop star singing young woman.  Taken as a joke, initially, by the woman, Bryan quickly redeems himself after fending off a would be assailant who attempted to assault Sheerah with a knife after her performance.  To thank Bryan for his help, Sheerah agrees to assist Bryan's daughter Kim in vocal lessons.  However, when Bryan attempts to tell his daughter of the good news, he is never given the chance to speak since Kim is more excited about the idea of her and her friend Amanda traveling to Paris.

Reluctant at first, Bryan agrees to let his daughter leave, under the circumstances that she contacts him as soon she gets there.  Breaking her promise, Kim does not call her father upon arrival in Paris, but instead her and Amanda decide to go get ready for a party that a young man just told them about.  Kim gets a call from her father who is angry that she did not call him back, in the midst of their conversation, Kim witnesses Amanda being kidnapped from within the house.  Bryan walks Kim through the steps to try to stay safe, but ultimately he realizes that the kidnappers are going to get her no matter what.  Before she is taken, he tells her to shout out as many details about the men's appearance as she can.

Bryan tells the men that he will find them, and that he will kill them, and using his skills he has acquired from the CIA, he does just that.  Despite being hundred of miles away, Bryan is capable of piecing together pieces of the crime, establishing a trail to the men responsible for the kidnapping.  The film depicts all of the actions that Bryan must undergo in order to save his daughter.  Using his talents in the field of investigation,  he learns the reasoning behind his daughter's abduction, as well as the source.  He learns that due to the circumstances, he only has a few hours to retrieve his daughter, this quickly turns the film into a race against the clock, as Bryan only has a few hours left to save his daughter, or risk never seeing her again.

The film's story is deep and emotional, allowing the audience to feel Bryan's pain and suffering and his pure devotion for his daughter Kim.  His actions make the film a truly amazing action movie, utilizing hand to hand combat as well as weapons to overcome obstacles, yet never feeling too over the top, but rather sticking to more believable acts of human strength.  Utilizing stealth, and cunning and well thought out plans, Bryan is capable of overpowering his enemies at every turn, even when things look extremely grim for the man.  ""Taken"" is a film that shows the power of love, the determination of a father, yet still contains the necessary formula and scenes that are required to make a great action flick.  Rather than sinking as low as other action movies that rely more on action sequences and less on storyline, ""Taken"" finds a great balance, making the film truly worth watching.",1287964800,2,3598,4.577223088923557

5942203,3,B00ANT85VY,"Taken is an easy movie to watch, and it passes quickly at only an hour and a half. The plot of the story has already been discussed, so suffice to say that it isn't at all a realistic movie. It isn't really believable that a man in his fifties will outfight dozens and dozens of armed, young men, no matter how well trained he is. Especially considering that at many points in the movie, the bad guys have clear shots at him, yet inexplicably miss.

There are logic gaps everywhere. For example, in the scene where Neeson visits the home of his friend the chief inspector of French Police (or whoever he is), the friend sneaks a gun to the dinner table and tries to kill Neeson, who had earlier emptied the gun of its bullets. What was to prevent the man from checking his gun to see if it had any bullets in it, before coming to the table?

Silly risk. Anyway...

If the movie were done with a tongue-in-cheek, self aware attitude it might be more fun. The insertion of techno music during action sequences (the sort of action sequence where Neeson looses five or six rounds and kills five or six men, and those same men miss Neeson with one million sub-machinegun bullets) seems to indicate that this is that sort of picture.

However, the movie seems to take itself too seriously. How come Neeson kills five billion (maybe fewer, whatever) people but doesn't have to face any cops for what he did?

Was his daughter emotionally scarred at all from all of this? She seemed pretty okay at the end of the film, even though it all happened recently (her dad's arm was still in a cast). Then it's implied she will become a professional pop star. I guess as a reward for being spoiled her whole life and ignoring her father's warnings.

I wonder if she cared that her ""best friend"" died horribly of a drug overdose while being abused by thugs.

But never mind, she will be a pro singer.

Hey, why did Neeson shoot the French guy's wife? Oh yes, to prove he meant business! He really wanted his daughter back!

""Hey, I'll murder your wife, your kids, and then you, mister. My kid's life is the only thing that's important!""

Lots of random, innocent slobs get killed, too. Like some party security guy watching an elevator, or a guy carrying champagne. Probably just earning a salary and waiting for the clock to indicate it's time to go home to their apartment and maybe play a DVD and relax.

But NO! They got in Neeson's way, so NECK-SNAP!

That's the trouble with this movie. We're supposed to believe that Neeson is the good guy, but he's selfish. He kills people who may not even be evil, just to accomplish his goal.

But at least he did accomplish his goal. Hey, he DID call the police about all those girls he found, being used as prostitute slaves, didn't he? He DID, right?

No? Well how about his daughter's dead friend's cousins? What did they think about their relative dying horribly?

5942204,3,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson's characterization of a highly trained black ops operative desperate to retrieve his kidnapped daughter who is for sale as a sex slave is excellent.  He portrayed a wide range of emotions in the film and did them all well and is especially good as a father competing with his daughter's rich stepfather for her affections.  When he assumes his black ops persona, he has a subtle way of making you believe that he would tear your face off if necessary and move on impassively.  But two words kept popping into my head during every one of the film's action scenes:  JACK BAUER.  It's all there: the automatic weapon fire that always misses our hero until the obligatory non-fatal shoulder wound at the film's climax; the pistol fire the hero uses that NEVER misses; the impossible odds our hero always overcomes; the flaunting of every rule in the book and getting away with it; dozens upon dozens of bad guys dying by his hand, etc.  Taken is a well crafted thriller and Neeson is very good in his roll.

In it Neeson plays a man who use to work for the Central Intelligence Agency and finds himself embroiled in trying to find his teenaged daugher who has been kidnapped by maniacs working for an Albanian sex slave operation in France.

 The film is not for the weak: the torture scenes are violent, graphic, nail-biting, and extremely hair-raising which is why some of the scenes in the original version had to be cut in order for the film to receive a PG-13 rating. Those scenes that were cut are available on this two disc edition.

 ""Taken"" is a well-acted, fast-paced movie that will not only please fans of actions movies, but fans of Liam Neeson; it's nice to see he finally has a huge hit on his hands.

5942207,5,B00ANT85VY,"If you're going to Europe, and you're young and relatively naive - which is a nice way of saying you're a dumb American who takes personal safety for granted, or if you are the parents of someone like that - do yourself a favor and watch Taken. It might keep you from making a worse than stupid mistake.

No, I'm not a paranoid freak, but I have traveled a good part of this globe and seen things. A couple of summers ago, I spent some time in Italy. I was amazed at the blatant stupidity so many American kids under the age of 25, exhibit. I don't know if it's because they've seen a gazillion teen movies where the thing to do is go abroad and get laid or what. But I saw teen girls hanging out of their hotel room windows, accosting men passing beneath their window. They were looking for a good time with a cute Italian boy.

So, is Taken an accurate portrait of what can happen to naive, unsuspecting young women? Well, let's just say it may not happen every day (I hope), but it happens. Unfortunately, when it happens, (SPOILER ALERT) I don't think the young women are ever rescued the way the girl is rescued in this film.

This isn't just a non-stop action film, it has emotional depth, portrayed subtly, yet effectively, by Liam Neeson's craggy features. His daughter is his whole life. He's lost everything else, and he knows it. And he knows why. He's determined to solidify the bonds with his nearly-grown daughter. His devotion is shown in the way he carefully selects her birthday present. With careful attention to detail, he wraps the present himself. With every strip of tape he tears, he's pouring his love into the wrapping of a present that's modest compared to the expensive gifts given by his wife's wealthy husband. He hangs in there which is sometimes the hardest thing for a man to do when his wife and child have moved on. Most men write it off and move on also.

Taken is an action thriller, but it's also the portrait of a man who will do whatever it takes to save his child. Though most of us don't have the Jack Bauer-skills, as possessed by the character in this film, that willingness to protect our children is something we all identify with. That's the universal truth that makes the film work, and that's why there's emotional resonance in Taken.

The film is written by Luc Besson; known for the La Femme Nikita franchise, The Fifth Element, and The Transporter franchise; and Robert Mark Kamen; known for Taps, The Karate Kid franchise, Gladiator, and A Walk in the Clouds as well as The Fifth Element and The Transporter franchise. The two work in what I call the uncommon hero action thriller.

All of Besson's heroes are men of adventure now doing prosaic jobs. In Fifth Element starring Bruce Willis, the hero was driving a cab. In Transporter, the hero, once a Ranger, was a driver who transported whatever. In Taken, the hero is a retired spy/black ops/whatever who's working security gigs. He uses his old skills to save his daughter who is being forced into the sex/slave trade.

I suspect Kamen brings the emotional resonance to the partnership. His previous works are emotionally charged conflicts. In Taps, the hero is tortured by the demands of honor and obedience. In Karate Kid, the hero is young and untried and faced with standing up to bullies despite the consequences. In A Walk in the Clouds, the hero, played superbly by Keanu Reeves, is offering his protection to and falling in love with, a young woman, pregnant out of wedlock in the 1940's.

Universal truth is the difference between a good flick and a great one that will be remembered. Taken will be remembered.",1280707200,,3625,4.5919629057187015
5942208,5,B00ANT85VY,This movie is amazing and everyone that i know has enjoyed seeing this film. it has a great plot along with suspenseful bloody action. The acting is amazing and everyone should at least rent this movie a couple of times if not buy it.,1280448000,,234,4.340909090909091
5942209,5,B00ANT85VY,"So many action movies just have spectacular and unrealistic explosions for their own sake. You won't find much of the pointless effects in this one. This one has a story behind it.

Enter Brian, a retired special forces operator who wants only to spend time wiht his daughter, access to whom is blocked by his estranged ex-wife and new husband. While he does his best to ensure she knows he loves her, she is a teenager and is really only concerned with herself. When she lies to him for permission to go to Paris, he reluctantly allows it provided she follow some requirements. She cannot even fulfill the first, which is to call him when the plane lands. While she is an innocent, he has traveled the world trouble-shooting and knows the dangers that await the unwary. Dangers that find his innocent daughter when she is kidnapped to be sold into slavery.

Now, while he had been retired to be close to her, she has not been taken from him. Retirement is postponed. His pursuit is fast, brutal and relentless. The criminals who seek to prevent his recovery get shown no mercy. We see wonderfully choreographed fight scenes, quick and severe as they should be considering the stakes. We get to see the difference between mere thugs and a trained military professional. The criminals don't deserve mercy. Plowing through the seedy underworld of Paris, Brian moves further and further along the chain until he learns where his daughter is being sold.

Overcoming adversity after obstacle after impediment, Brian refuses to give up. The final scenes show this determination come to the fore as he ignores wounds to continue his mission. While some of the gunplay near the end gets a bit extravagant, with automatic weapons being sprayed as stunt performers dive behind furniture somewhat reminiscent of Bruckheimer movies, it is for the most part well-done and not over glorified. It's a dirty business and it's shown that way.

The stunt driving is extraordinary, not as fantastic as Ronin but certainly close to the same league. The story marches on without needless diversions, and while the resolution comes somewhat abruptly, with no bridge between the final act of retribution and the return to the States, it's forgiveable.

While I would have liked Brian to tell his daughter off a bit about why he'd given her the rules in the first place, he's just not an ""I told you so"" kinda guy. He does what he does, he loves his daughter, and he's forthright about it all.

While this version does give the theatrical and extended versions, there are no other special features. If you need the commentaries and behind the scenes features, you should limit yourself to the two-disc set. If you just want to watch a gritty and well-done action movie with realistic action, characters, and plot, then you should check this out.",1280016000,,2821,4.830227743271221
5942210,4,B00ANT85VY,I love this movie!  Who knew Liam Neeson would be SUCH an action star!  He's really good and VERY believable.  It also has a good story.  The action is pretty much non stop.  I would definitely recommend this movie.  It's a fun movie.,1279497600,,234,4.325581395348837
5942211,4,B00ANT85VY,"It is my proposition that Taken should be considered as two separate things. For the fan of the action movie genre Liam Nesson plays the ultimate in kick ass bad guy as a former CIA agent who is out to take souls and break lives after his daughter Kim is abducted by Albanian gangster terrorists on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda. Nesson takes no prisoners and is quite sympathetic in his role as a father battling an incompetent governmental system to save his daughter and there's plenty of bloodshed and bad guys that end up on the wrong end of his gun, along with several edgy car chase scenes. As an action fan, you won't be disappointed with this film.

As someone who has read a great deal of the problem of human trafficking, I was disappointed in the portrayal of human trafficking. Firstly although abductions do occur most domestic trafficking occurs through false job offers. Secondly, its' hard to believe that no one would take notice of an abduction that was that blatant. Furthermore, although the scenes featuring the girls as drug addicts are quite pointed, they felt to me more like an avenue to get to Nesson's character to kick some more ass rather then focus on the actual conditions that trafficked girls face. If I was doing this movie from a trafficking perspective, I would've spent more time focusing on what happens to Kim between abduction and rescue. Not only do you get more powerful visuals, but it would make Nesson's character even more sympathetic because the audience would get a broader view of Amanda's captivity. As a trafficking movie, the movie isn't the greatest at giving a realist view of the phenomenon.

However, if your action movie buff who's looking for a ninety minute killer and are not looking for an expose on human trafficking. You'll enjoy Taken because it doesn't feel like ninety minutes.",1279324800,,1853,4.751552795031056
5942212,4,B00ANT85VY,"5 stars for the fast-paced action minus 1 star for allowing the bad guys to get off so easily. Yes, you read that right. The bad guys got off too easily in this serious movie that tells of a serious real-world subject. Why spend less than 5 minutes of screen time playing with Marko the kidnapper?

Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA officer (Bryan Mills) who single-handedly kicks up a minor storm in France while trying to find his kidnapped daughter. The girl, along with her loser female friend, got kidnapped by human traffickers while preparing to follow U2 band across their European tour. Upon touching down in France, the girls were befriended by a handsome local male. Unknown to them, this guy (Peter) was in league with a human trafficking ring. Suspense and fast-paced action follow that moment on as Bryan Mills tracks down the kidnappers' trails and leaving accidental corpses of bad guys here and there. The crooked French cops don't want to see Mills running loose in the city of Paris, but a man's got to do what he's got to do, especially since the local cops are so useless. Finally after some Steven Segal-type battles, Bryan Mills gets to rescue his daughter and they go back to America safe and sound.

If you like action movies, this Liam Neeson movie can fill your collection.
In a sense, this movie reminds me of ""Death Sentence"", starring Kevin Bacon.
In ""Death Sentence"", the cops are also so useless that the victim's father has to find justice on his own.

STARRING: Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Leland Orser, Holly Valance, Katie Cassidy, Xander Berkeley and Oliver Rabourdin

WRITTEN BY: Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen

DIRECTED BY: Pierre Morel

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Action / Thriller
Release Date: 30 January 2009

There is almost nothing more rewarding in a film, than one that can entertain you and stimulate your brain on current events simultaneously. Taken is marvelous at this because its premise is not only something that makes for a great action thriller, but is also a huge problem in the world today, often overlooked by many: human trafficking.

Liam Neeson gives a balls-to-the wall performance as ex CIA operative Mills. Neeson may not look like an angry stud like Willis, Schwarzenegger or Stallone; but trust me, after seeing him here, he's more than convincing. I enjoyed seeing him play a ruthless villain in Batman Begins, and he takes that same dark edge and brings it to our hero in Taken.

Mills has lived a vey fast paced life and seen action in numerous global conflicts to include Afghanistan. All that is behind him now though, as he has made plans to mend his tattered relationship with his teenage daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Between the hurt feelings of several missed birthdays and Christmases due to the excessive travel of his job, and Kim's mother's new insanely rich live-in boyfriend; Mills has his work cut out for him.

At 91 minutes, Taken is a very short film, especially for its genre. But it never seems short and it gives us everything we need early on, to care for its characters and the events that happen to them. The relationship between Mills and his daughter is crucial to the story and had it not been believable, the film would have suffered. It is believable. He cares for her more than anything in the world and wants nothing but for her to be happy.

So naturally, when his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and Kim need his permission for Kim to leave the country, to follow U2 to France with a friend, Mills wants to oblige them. It's painstakingly hard for him at first, as he is more than aware of the dangers that face a young girl traveling without adult supervision in Europe; but we already know from the film's title that he will let her go.

Mills is super-smart however and exceptionally well prepared. He buys her a universal cell phone, and only agrees to let her go if she will in turn agree to calling and checking in with him at his approved times.

On the first day in France, Kim witnesses from across the hall, her friend being kidnapped. The film's pivotal moment is a phone call between Kim and her father as she explains to him what is happening.

When I first saw the trailer, I thought Mills was in on it, by his freakishly calm comment to his daughter, ""They're going to take you."" But the only reason he is so calm is because he realizes he only has a few precious seconds to tell Kim what to do, before these heinous men take her. He tells her to hide under the bed and to shout out every detail that she can about her captors, and that he will come for her. The suspense builds from there as one of them actually picks up the phone, and Mills delivers some of the best one-liners in any action film of recent years. The scumbag's response? ""Good luck.""

Having obviously recorded this conversation with hi-tech spy equipment, Mills uses sources in Langley to assist in narrowing down the list of suspects. A nice little game of `I told you so', and an immediate plane ticket to France from his ex-wife and her rich boyfriend, and he's off.

Taken could have easily been over the top and unrealistic but Neeson plays Mills so genuinely, that we never doubt he'd be capable of pulling any of these things off. Yeah, there are a few one guy takes on several guys action sequences, but they are executed well and initiated with Mills' brains, rather than bronze. His wits and extensive training allow him to infiltrate these European trafficking layers with great ease.

I have no idea how they pulled off a PG - 13 rating, but they did! The action is intense and in your face and the suspense could shatter bones. Mills has no mercy in this film and we love him for it. Watch for the scene that takes place at a dinner table, while Mills visits an old friend. You will never see what he does coming; you'll know the one I mean.

I really enjoyed the actors they cast to play the villains in the film as well; you really want to see them suffer for what they've done to these young women. In case you are unfamiliar with the term human trafficking, let me simplify it for you. They kidnap young women, drug them, and sell them to rich men to use as sex slaves. Many of them as is the case with Kim are minors and virgins, and they go for the most cash. Make no mistake, this may be a big Hollywood movie, but this goes on every day in our world.

I've read some skeptical reviews on the film from writers who seriously doubt that this world exits to the extent that the film portrays. I'm more than convinced that it's not far off. I've seen some truly evil people in my life and I've seen how money can corrupt people too. Give evil men money and power and what do you think they'll do with it? No-one can deny that these women go missing, so where are they going then?",1273708800,,5308,4.466942148760331

And this movie does that.  Liam Neeson plays a terrific role in this film.  5 stars was an easy decision for me quite simply because I really enjoyed watching it.

5942230,4,B00ANT85VY,"During the summer of one of my college years I got a phone call from the father of a friend of mine. He needed me to take on an emergency house-sitting assignment. I agreed to do so, and then asked for the story behind the request.
 Parents John and Marg had for the first time left their 18 year old daughter home alone as they went on vacation. It was Fair season in Sonoma County, and Janet (the daughter) went with a friend. At the Fair, the girls found what most teenage girls are looking for: cute guys. Janet invited her ""new friends"" to her house to play pool. A good time was had by all, and the guys invited Janet and her friend to meet them the next night at the Fair.
 The next night, Janet couldn't find the guys at the Fair. She returned home to find that her home had been robbed. She called her parents in a panic, then went to stay at a friend's home. That's when I was called to house-sit. Janet's foolish choice to trust these strangers could have led to something very much worse.
 In the film Taken, a daughter's choice to trust a cute guy does lead to much worse. On a trip to Paris with a friend, she is abducted by sex slave traders. The sex trade is a real problem, but I would think the cable news networks would be giving the Paris airports a little more air time if they were as dangerous as they are portrayed in this movie. But realism is not this film's strong suit. It is a fantasy about a father who will do anything to save his daughter.
 And it is a fantasy many Americans have been anxious to share. This low budget French production screened in Europe a year ago and just hit American screens in January. With a fairly low wattage cast (no offense to Liam Neeson who played Oskar Schindler and Qui-Gon Jinn) and is very credible in his role) the film is looking to make $150 million  and has had a remarkable staying power in theaters.
 I think much of its popularity is due to its playing out two fantasies (really two sides of the fantasy coin.)
 One side of the fantasy is for the parent. Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a former government agent whose job kept him far from home, damaging his relationship with his daughter and ruining his marriage. His daughter thinks he is overprotective and worries too much. (When his daughter tells him he should worry less, he responds that is like telling water it should be less wet.) His daughter ignores his advice and goes to Europe with a friend. When she's abducted, it's up to her father to rescue her.
 And if he can rescue her, she'll see that her father was right, and she will finally appreciate him. Columnist Jonah Goldberg wrote a very funny review of this film in which he called it ""Patriarchal Porn"" -- not at all in the sexual sense, but rather that the film appeals to a parent's basic protective instincts. As a father, he wrote that the film fulfills the parental fantasy of seeing a child realize that indeed, father does know best.
 The other side of the fantasy is from the perspective of the child. (I did have a little difficulty seeing Maggie Grace as a ""17 year old child"" in the film, since I watched the actress play an older character in the first season of Lost a few years ago.)
 Still, the fantasy of a Rescuing Father is a powerful one: the idea that no matter how dire the situation, there is someone who will stop at nothing to rescue you. And Neeson in the film will certainly stop at nothing. He breaks international law, risks his own life and quite ruthlessly takes others' lives. At times, he makes 24's Jack Bauer seem rather effeminate.
 He will stop at nothing to save his daughter.
 Don't we wish someone cared for us like that?
 At this time of Easter, we remember we do have someone like that. We've made stupid choices. We choose to sin, and sin leads to death (Romans 6:23). But Jesus entered the world, and He would stop at nothing to save us. But instead of taking the lives of others, He gave up His own life (John 15:13, I Timothy 2:6).
 Watching the film, unless you are a much more worthy person than I am, you can't help wanting to cheer when you see corrupt kidnappers and sexual predators meet their nasty ends. In the real world, God sees even the worst of sinners as rebellious children that He loves and desires to save.
 When Jesus died on the cross and rose again, He proved Himself the Ultimate Action Hero.",1269388800,2,4348,4.357231149567367
5942231,3,B00ANT85VY,"Well, all props to a suspense-thriller these days which has the nerve to posit an Arab as one of the villains. Heck, that hasn't happened in a mainstream movie in simply ages, not since Ah-nold was only a movie actor and not the Governator of California. So, here is a taut and swift-moving thriller, with a seemingly indestructible hero/family man, single-mindedly boring through Paris like a runaway oil-rig drill, utilizing old contacts, old friends, mad spy skilz and no little willingness to pour on the specialized brutality - in search of his kidnapped daughter. And quell horror, she's been kidnapped by some middle-European baddies involved in what used to be called a white slave ring, which is what they used to call low-life traffickers in women for sex ... a plot that is probably as almost as old as the oldest profession. And Liam Neeson does very well, as the retired black-ops veteran, hoping to reconnect with his teen-aged daughter, even if his ex-wife has married a fabulously wealthy man who can offer the girl everything except rescue, when she and her best friend fly off to Paris for a bit of un-chaperoned adventure. Of all the A-class movie leading male talent, he actually looks rather battered, weathered, as if he has had a life - and a strenuous one at that. He is a man, not a pretty boy dressed up in a man's costume. He is believable as a retired spy; old enough to be experienced, but young enough to be physically believable as an action hero.  And while it might not be quite believable that the hero would be allowed to leave France without spending at least a little time answering some fairly serious questions down at police headquarters - ""Taken"" moves at such a brisk pace that one doesn't even think of such questions until afterward.",1269043200,,1777,4.732258064516129

5942234,4,B00ANT85VY,"""Taken"" is a well made action flick and also a fantasy of revenge and redemption, starring Liam Neeson as retired CIA operative Bryan Mills. It's the kind of role that Harrison Ford might have done well with 10 or 15 years ago. Neeson is very good, but he doesn't have Ford's humor, and the script is mostly humorless, too.

Mills's ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen, Jean Grey in the X-Men franchise), dumped him ostensibly because Mills's CIA work kept him away from home, but she then managed to marry some very rich guy. Mills lives in L.A. to be closer to their teen-aged daughter, Kim.

Mills gets his chance to prove his worth -- when everyone else seems worthless -- when Kim, on a trip to Paris with a girlfriend, Amanda, is kidnapped by an Albanian gang that targets young, attractive Western women and, we learn, forces them into prostitution and sexual slavery. Mills tells the kidnappers on the telephone, ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.""

Through the rest of the movie, Mills makes good on his promise.

Along the way, the flick shamelessly panders to American prejudices. I dunno; maybe other people share the same prejudices. The Albanian bad guys seem to be Muslims. The French may be civilized, but they are useless, unprincipled, and corrupt. The most repulsive bad guy is an old, rich, corpulent, lascivious Arab sheik. Another really bad guy is an American businessman. He tells Mills not to take things personally, because selling Kim to the highest bidder was just business. (Maybe this is supposed to sound like when a health insurance company cuts off coverage to a customer who's gotten sick; that's just business, too. Nothing personal.) Mills doesn't reply but shoots the businessman dead.  Mills doesn't negotiate or hesitate; he's a pure man of action. He tortures. He kills. He shows no mercy. In one key scene, a bad guy holds a knife to a hostage's throat. He starts to say, ""We can nego--"", but Mills shoots him in the head.

There's nothing erotic in this PG-13 flick, but there are strong sexual themes. Much is made of the fact that Kim is a virgin. Mills at first refuses permission for Kim to go to Europe, which he sees as dangerous and corrupting, but he eventually gives in to the lies and manipulations of his ex-wife, Lenore.  Even before the kidnappers show up, we learn he was right to be wary. Kim's friend, Amanda, sees the trip as a sexual adventure for the two of them and nothing at all like the harmless trip to visit Paris museums that Kim and Lenore had described to Mills. This is not spelled out, but Lenore, like Amanda, probably saw the trip as a chance for Kim gain sexual experience. After the kidnapping, Kim's virginity saves her. It makes her a valuable commodity unlike the experienced and hence disposable Amanda. At a subsequent auction of abducted women, Kim is offered as the last and most valuable item because of her ""certified purity."" Mills's race to save Kim sometimes seems like a race to save her virginity as much as her life. Make of this what you will.",1268697600,,3455,4.536115569823435

It's primarily a revenge thriller and it does that job quite well.  The burning need for retribution is an extremely powerful force in the human psyche and this movie plays on that emotion quite effectively.

5942236,4,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson shares a trait that all great actors possess - they can do something completely ridiculous and remain entirely believable.  If you're watching Patrick Stewart play Jean-Luc Picard on ""Star Trek - Next Generation,"" you're watching an actual Star Fleet captain rather than a ham actor over-acting on a cheesy set.  If you're watching Sigourney Weaver in ""Alien,"" you're watching Ripley take on the universe's most dangerous monster rather than an actress dancing with a rubber suit.  If you're watching Meryl Streep in ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" you're watching an egotistical editor of a fashion magazine, not a drama queen emoting for effect.

From ""Darkman"" to ""Star Wars"" to ""Taken,"" Neeson has always remained believable and compelling no matter how ridiculous his surroundings or god-awful the dialogue.

In ""Taken,"" we have to believe that Bryan Mills (Neeson) is a lethal espionage/security guy, one of the best in the world, whose dedication to the job cost him his family.  Too late, he realized his error and quit so he can live in unemployed drudgery and snatch a few moments here and there with his cherished daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace).  Bryan's ex, Lenore (Famke Jannsen, in a thankless role), has custody of Kim and has remarried a sugar daddy who is actually a better person than Lenore.  Kim desperately pleads with Bryan to let her go to Paris with her friend Amanda to tour museums.  Bryan reluctantly consents, going against his better instincts that his 17-year old baby is going to a dangerous place and is not ready for it.

Unfortunately, Bryan is right - within minutes of landing in Paris, things go horribly, horribly wrong.  If you saw the trailer for ""Taken,"" you know that the movie is about Bryan's hunt for Kim across the Parisian underworld.

This is where ""Taken"" takes flight in a ""Bourne Ultimatum"" kind of way.  There is virtually no character development - the question is whose arm Bryan will break (or worse) as he hunts for his daughter, and how efficiently he'll do it.  Like Jason Bourne, Bryan Mills is not an acrobatic martial artist who will jump, twirl, and kick for dramatic effect - he'll rip your ears off and snap your legs with economic fury.  He's not doing it to be cool.  He's doing what he needs to do to get his daughter back.

Woe betide any man or woman who gets in his way.  ""Taken"" strings together a preposterous chain of events that could never happen in a gazillion years, but you won't have time to figure that out until after the movie is over.  For 90-odd minutes, you'll be taken on a compelling thrill ride, courtesy of Neeson and team.

Full disclosure - while this movie owes an obvious debt to the ""Bourne"" franchise as far as the feel and look of the film is concerned, it is considerably darker in both subject matter and tone.  This is far from a feel-good movie - you get the sense there are no winners here.",1267401600,,2894,4.725099601593626

5942256,5,B00ANT85VY,"I wouldn't advise watching this movie just before you go to bed; it is a visually disturbing movie. Yes, there is a lot of exciting action, great chases, one on foot, and plenty of the bad guys getting what they deserve. That, for me, was not disturbing. I did watch the unrated version of the movie, not the theatrical version; it may be that some of the scenes which I found most disturbing are not in the theatrical release.

The disturbing part to me was the picture of young people, especially young women, taking chances that can ruin their lives. The old saying that teenagers had better do what they're going to do while they're teenagers and still know everything seems to fit this movie all too well.

A number of scenes showing the depravity of the slave trade are very saddening. Young women, imprisoned as prostitutes and chattel, graphically show the dangers that can lurk in societies today.

One lasting impression is that there are too many really evil people out there today. I'm afraid that too many Americans have no notion of how bad things can sometimes get; they seem to believe that bad things only happen to someone else.

I may watch the theatrical release later and see which scenes were deleted. The scenes in the unrated version made a convincing case for all of the actions taken by the father as he attempted to rescue his daughter.

One of a number of issues that were glossed over was the lasting psychological impact of the experience on the daughter even after her rescue; she would never be the same again and would, I suspect, require extensive counseling to have any hope of resuming a normal life. Post traumatic stress disorder would be as much a problem for her as for any soldier; it could take years for the negative effects of this experience to be overcome. In that regard, the ending was much too much Hollywood Pollyannaism.

If you can set aside your reason and just take the movie for what it is, it offers a fast paced, action packed movie that won't let you go; at 91 minutes it's relatively short and is over rather quickly. With the caveats mentioned above I can recommend this as an exciting action movie.",1264291200,,2159,4.609375

5942264,4,B00ANT85VY,"2008's extremely violent thriller ""Taken"" features Liam Neeson as Brian Mills, a retired spy whose daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped by white slavers from her apartment in Paris.

Mills puts the skill set of his former employment to work.  He is prepared to rescue his daughter by any means necessary.  What follows is a thrill ride across Paris, through streets, cellars, apartments, offices and bridges, as Mills methodically and ruthlessly wrings information from various felons and follows the clues to a final showdown on a barge in the Seine River.

The action is fast, furious, and fatal, as Mills leaves a trail of corpses behind him.  The good news is that they all had it coming.  The bad news is the PG-13 rating should be taken seriously.  The short running time (90 minutes) and almost continuous action cover up some gapping plot holes, while leaving little room for moral ambiguity.

With few clues, Daddy goes to Paris to recover his daughter. Simple plot idea, extremely well executed (hence my shout-out to Neeson). This is a violent and tough movie; Neeson's body count is around 50 and most with graphic and quick kills. Don't shoot at him, you'll only make him mad! Impressive how he follows from clue to clue.

5942270,5,B00ANT85VY,"This movie seems to be a big DVD hit, and for good reason.  Taken is a return to some 1980s-type revenge movie antics, with Liam Neeson fitting into the hero role where we often expect a more musclebound star.

If you've seen the trailer...you know where it's going.  Neeson is some kind of ex-CIA operative, a ""preventer"", whose daughter is kidnapped about 10 seconds after landing in Paris.  Using some spare info she gave him on a long distance mobile phone call, he travels to Paris, and within minutes is cracking heads.  The villains are a band of Albanian kidnappers who grab travelling girls and sell them into prostitution.  Neeson single-handedly takes down a good portion of the crew in the course of this film, wiping folks out with chops to the throat, bullets, and even a makeshift electric chair.

The movie is pure audience manipulation, and you'll be rooting for Neeson to bash heads with glee.  The daughter and her airhead friend are helpfully stupid, immediately talking to strangers who work for the kidnappers, Neeson's ex-wife is appropriately awful, and the ex-CIA-guy-as-Superman cliche is amply employed.  The movie is very brisk, has several action set pieces (including at least two car chases filmed like car commercials, of course), and knows that you know it's getting ridiculous but not letting up.  Neeson is very convincing as a calm, collected, demolition man who knows all sorts of random, McGuyver-esque tricks and barely breaks a sweat as he chases cars on foot, takes out a dozen guys in a minute, and breaks all manners of bones and heads, while wrecking parts of Paris, to track down his daughter.

The American version was surprisingly rated PG-13, even with Neeson taking out about 30 guys, and with the plot of international prostitute smuggling cheerily explored.  The Extended, Unrated version adds some more gunshots and chops in, and indeed is less jerky since you could tell things were cut to get the softer rating.

Highly recommended for fans of fast-paced, man-on-a-mission revenge flicks, this is great for repeat viewings, and very ripe for sequel or even franchise potential.  They'd be crazy not to explore Neeson whooping some other gang-du-jour in a prequel or new episode where his puppy is kidnapped.",1261872000,,2261,4.994666666666666

5942275,4,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson does an unexpected about face from his usual touchy feely roles and makes an inhuman turn for the best in this ultraviolent yet strangely touching action film.

Brian Mills is an ex-CIA agent/ex-Marine/ex everything, I guess, who has spent most of his life doing very undercover dangerous James Bond things.  At the beginning we see a lonely man who, to all outward appearances, seems very gentle and attempting to make up for lost time with his gorgeous daughter, Kim.  Having spent his life dealing with dangerous people and preventing ""bad things"" (where was Brian Mills on before 9/11? Couldn't a guy like this grab Osama Bin Laden in five seconds?)

Anyway, against his advice, his daughter goes to Paris with a few of her friends.  Brian is concerned because he is aware that there are people who are into selling young girls into a slave trade for high class criminals.  And, of course, his daughter gets kidnapped.

Neeson does a superb job of turning within the course of about fifteen seconds from a concerned father into a walking, barking, unstoppable killing machine.  The reason the film is believable is because of Neeson's blank facial expression, his ability to switch off his emotions in a deadly second, and his ruthlessness.  Whoever trained the actor in whatever martial art/self defense skills did a good job.  And Mills is no angel.  There are scenes in which he way too far.  There is nothing sentimental about it.  He wants his daughter and nothing going to stop him unless it's a very well placed bullet.

Though some of this might strike the viewer as a bit far fetched, it is Liam Neeson's performance that makes it worth watching.  A riveting, chilling movie.",1261094400,,1700,4.833910034602076

5942277,3,B00ANT85VY,"One recent moment of great humor for me was watching 72-year-old Charles Bronson destroy bad guys and outrun automatic weapon fire during the fifth installment of his ever popular ""Death Wish"" series. That movie, made in 1994, was the end of the line for fans of that particular series. While Charles Bronson apparently wasn't available to play the lead here, ""Taken"" seems to have, ahem, taken up the mantle from ""Death Wish 5"" with ridiculous levels of action and heroism.

If you've been living in a cave somewhere, the plot of ""Taken"" is Liam Neeson's 17-year-old daughter goes to France with her teenage friend -- over dad's objections -- and is almost immediately kidnapped. This happens while she's on the phone with dad, a former security expert, who ends up talking to her kidnapper and vowing revenge.

Having apparently no financial worries, Neeson flies to Paris, almost immediately finds out who did the kidnapping, finds the guy and chases him to his death on a freeway ramp. This begins a lengthy discourse in ultra-violence and bloodletting rare even for this genre of film. You probably can figure out for yourself without seeing the movie the sequence of events and ending, so I won't bother with them. Suffice it to say the body count is high and the action plentiful.

I found myself both involved in this movie and laughing through much of it. There is no indication the filmmakers were trying to create a parody and the leading man certainly does nothing to generate laughs. He is completely serious throughout in the same way the steely-eyed and thoughtless James Bond of Daniel Craig contrasts to the cool, tongue in cheek and sophisticated superagent portrayl of Sean Connery.

If you like action, revenge and/or violence, you should watch this film at your earliest opportunity. It's pretty good as these films go with fine production qualities. Neeson's characterization, while not credible because of a flawed script and lack of vision, is compelling nonetheless. You'll probably root for him whether you like the movie or not.",1260489600,,2055,4.982507288629738

TAKEN is not for Sundance audiences or art houses; it's grand edge-of-your-seat escapism that takes the viewer on a wild, bumpy ride as former CIA agent (at least, we assume he's former CIA) Bryan Mills goes to Paris to kick some serious bad guy arse.

After grudgingly giving his teenage daughter (who lives in the lap of luxury with her mother and ultra-rich stepfather) permission to spend the summer in Paris with a friend and the friend's ""cousins"", we are not surprised to see the daughter get violently kidnapped by Albanian thugs running a sleazy prostitution ring.  Well, they picked on the wrong teenager, as agent Mills (Liam Neeson plays this delightfully close to the vest) is about to show them all who's your Daddy.  Putting all his clandestine skills to task, Mills mows through the Paris underground like a weedeater on acid, doing mega damage to all who stand in his way.  Of course, his relentless, cold-blooded, calculating pursuit ultimately pays bloody dividends and last-second heroics, making TAKEN one fun ride--even if none of it is believable.

""Taken"" is an outstanding, suspenseful, action-packed thriller about Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), a former international spy whose teenage daughter is kidnapped while on an overseas trip with one of her friends. Bryan hurries to Paris and uses all his old spy skills to track down the creeps who have taken his daughter and plan to sell her into prostitution.

5942281,4,B00ANT85VY,"There are literally thousands upon thousands of films to watch these days; films in any genre that you can possible think of.  Some of these films are great films, some are horrible and some are horrible and great at the same time.  It really all depends upon you mood and what you want to watch at any given time.  Now I normally like romantic comedies or films such as The Princess Bride.  But that being said, I also like a mixture in the type of movies I watch.  I do not like a complete steady diet of just one type.

There are times I enjoy seeing a complete bang, bang kill everything in sight type of movie; one where the bad guy is really, really bad and get his or her just reward.  Call them revenge films, retribution films, breaking all the rules films, or what ever.  Now I would not want to watch this sort of film every day, or even ever week or month, but sometimes it can be a good thing.  It seems to satisfy some dark inner beastie lurking somewhere in my psyche.  Well this film filled that need, sort of like a fix, and I will be good to go now to other films for a few months.

The story is quite simple; if simple you want it to be.  A young woman joins her good friend and they travel to Paris to spend the summer. This is against the better judgment of her father, played by Liam Neeson, one of my favorite actors.  As chance would have it, the girls are captured by some really evil, despicable, cruel, and thoroughly dislikable men and are to be sold into sexual enslavement.  The father, Neeson, happens to be an ex CIA agent with remarkable skills in seeking people out and killing them in uncounted unique ways, both with his hands and various weapons.  The story is about the father's search for his daughter and his efforts to locate her and restore her freedom.

The story starts out rather slow which allows the story and characters to be set up and developed, if you will.  Only one act of violence is shown at first and it is rather mild compared to what is to come.  The entire cast of good guy characters are rather likable, even the ex-wife and her super rich husband who you want to dislike but really don't.

Once the story gets started, i.e. the father arrives in Paris, then indeed this becomes a nonstop action thriller.  Like several other reviewers, I completely lost track of the body count after the first ten for fifteen.  These bad guys kept springing up all other and the nice thing about it was that they were the kind of villains you just love to hate.  The Neeson efficiently kills them all, some in groups, some one on one and in various ways using his many skills as needed.  Justice is swift in this little world and absolute. The father seems to be completely free of any restraint what so ever as far as the law goes and what little law there is to stop him is quickly brushed aside.

Now is this the best action thriller ever made?  No.  Is this a movie similar to Neeson's past work, such as Schindler's list?  No.  Are the special effects award winning?  No.  Is this a highbrow movie that  you would want to take your date or wife to in order to impress her with your intellectual choice of cinemagraphic art, and set for hours afterwards spouting effusions and pontificating as to its greatness, noting subtle nuances she might have missed?  I don't think so!

What this is, is a movie about a guy that kicks a lot of tail, kills a lot of people who richly deserve to be killed, and if you like such movies now and again, you will enjoy this one. It is a fantasy film and the deeds performed by our hero would indeed be quite impossible to perform in real life, or at least quite improbably.  That is what is nice about this film...it is hard core, high violence fantasy with out the blood and gore you are served up in movies such as the never ending Saw movies.  The acting is quite adequate and the story is interesting enough to hold your attention.  Watch if for what it is and just enjoy.

5942282,2,B00ANT85VY,The story line doesn't come close to being plausible.  The action scenes are absurdly exaggerated.  It's hard to get into this film because it's so silly.,1260057600,,154,4.884615384615385
5942283,3,B00ANT85VY,"Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired and divorced ex-spy, who now lives only for his estranged daughter.  The trouble is, while she seems happy enough to see him when he manages to meet her, usually she won't give him the time of day.  She's got all she wants from her enormously wealthy stepfather, and all she wants from her real father is permission to go to Paris.  He's reluctant because, as an ex-spy, I guess, he knows that Europe can be much more dangerous than most people think, especially for a naive young woman.  It turns out he's right, because the moment his daughter arrives with her friend in Paris, she's targeted and kidnapped by sex traffickers.  She manages to get a phone call off to her dad before she's abducted and immediately he's on the case - figures out who they are and plans do do much more than kick butt on his way to saving her.

Directed by Pierre Morel, this film has all the marks of its producer and writer, Luc Besson.  Mills is a classic Bessonian hero - who does what he does without remorse, and ruthlessly, but all in the service of good old-fashioned family values.  Luc Besson's heroes tend to be jaded professionals, highly competent at killing but without direction in their lives until they discover that they are meant to save some innocent, to fix some kind of family crisis.  It's a weird mix of visceral violence and sentimentality.  He takes on anyone who gets in his way, anyone who threatens his daughter, anyone who even refuses to help him on his way, and, according to the bizarre but effective Hollywood action film logic that Bresson distills to its essence, it's all okay, it's all morally acceptable, and it all comes out in the end.  The basic principle is that the ends always justifies the means, especially if family is at stake.  In films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>, there's something else at stake (lots of innocent lives, money, national security), but family is at the heart of it, and in this film that becomes the whole of it, sex trafficking merely becomes the vehicle, the focus for a father's rage.  Of course if you stop to think about it, you have to realize that this guy is a psychopath, and that there are proper channels for a reason, given the number of innocent lives he puts at risk on his quest to stop the bad guys - even though most of the bad guys he actually dispatches are truly bad.  Still, it's strange how easy it is, watching a film like this, to buy all that, and how hard it is not to.  It's a precise, taut, effective, action thriller, and Liam Neeson brings just the right mix of emotional intensity and ruthlessness for the audience to care about him and his emotional quest in spite of themselves.",1260057600,3,2815,4.751540041067762
5942284,4,B00ANT85VY,"Remember last year when you seen NOTHING but previews for this film?  I remember this VERY well.  The hype this movie received was almost too much to take!  It got to the point where the hype alone was turning me off.

Well it's been a year later, and I watched Taken tonight for the very first time trying to forget about those annoyingly repetitive commercials.

I started out VERY disappointed.  I have to be honest about that.  The very beginning of the movie shows the single father having memories of his daughter's birthday party from when she was just a little girl.  We've seen the same thing a MILLION times in other movies.  I was preparing myself for a very overrated and predictable film.  Some of the scenes even had a low budget feel to them.

The next 20 minutes didn't win me over either.  The father goes to his daughter's birthday party (he wasn't dreaming about it this time) to bring her a gift.

Then the fathers ex-wife enters the picture.  The two of them start talking and obviously they don't get along (filled with sarcastic little shots in between of course!)

Of course, her new husband enters the picture as well, pretends to be friends with the daughter's father, but you know very well they could never be friends because they talk in a way where it's plainly obvious they don't care about each other in the slightest, and then the father leaves the birthday party and returns home.

That's the first 20 minutes of film- horribly predictable story-telling we must have seen a million times.  So it's VERY important to keep watching past those 20 minutes.

When the actual story kicks in concerning the daughter having to get her fathers approval to take a vacation to France (by way of a signature signing taking place in a restaurant) *this* is when the plot development really gets interesting.

The father is reluctant to send his daughter to a foreign country for safety reasons, but eventually he gives in.  Otherwise he'd been considered a horrible father.

When the daughter arrives to France with her one friend, you see them having fun and dancing around in a hotel room.  The daughter walks into another room, and through a window she sees her friend being attacked and kidnapped by three or four strange men that walked into the room.  She panics, so she hides under a bed.

This is where you have to take into consideration the storyline is fictional, because the daughter calls up the father while hiding under a bed, and tells him what's going on with her friend.

The father then calmly and precisely gives his daughter instructions on how to handle the situation.

I was like ""Are you SERIOUS!""  Most fathers would become emotional, confused and worried if such a situation were to present itself.  Apparently this father thought he was some kind of superman who not only knew how to tell a darn good well-prepared speech, but also had an ability to remain completely calm over the phone WHILE the daughter was being taken away by the bad guys!

How is this possible?  Only in Hollywood.  Besides those little problems, the rest of the storyline is rather amazingly action-packed and features lots of shootings, violence, and killings, which is the norm for these kind of films.  I really enjoyed the movie after getting past all those predictable and impossible to believe moments.

So the film is great in the end.",1259971200,,3364,4.705479452054795
5942285,5,B00ANT85VY,"I really liked this movie. It was intriguing from the standpoint as a ""what if"", that the kidnappers made the mistake of stealing someone's daughter whose father is an extremely dangerous and capable ex-spy. A man who will be ""a nightmare"" to the kidnappers. Someone with the experience, know how and total lack of conscience when it comes to dealing with people like the kidnappers. He is willing to break all the rules to get his daughter back. And becomes vindicated to both his daughter, his ex-wife and her husband as being someone of value.
I was surprised at the choice of Liam Neeson as the lead but he did an excellent job as the ex-spy father. One can imagine what it would be like to have a child kidnapped. What would you do, especially knowing the odds would be against survival. But to have the tools that Neeson does as an ex-spy, it becomes intriguing to watch him use those tools and the extent he will go and having the capability to go there.
I looked at some of the negative reviews to see if there is something I can convey that would help someone to avoid this type of movie. If you do not believe that there are in fact, people of extraordinary skills when it comes to killing, accepting pain and surviving then skip this movie. If because your child became spoiled, brattish or similar, that you would disown them, leave them to die or suffer then skip this movie. If you would not do anything to save your child regardless of what they have done to you, how badly they have treated you then skip this movie. If you are expecting an accurate documentary on any aspect of this movie or that it should be a treatise on certain subjects, then skip this movie.",1259971200,2,1680,4.457792207792208

This movie ended quite accidentally on my DVD queue because I generally steer away from movies about the skin trade and terrorism, two genres I feel have been killed mindlessly. I watched this movie and was pleasantly entertained. Okay, this is not the most fantastic storytelling but the 96 minute running time passed quickly for me.

He gives a great performance in this movie and it seems like this role was tailor made for him.  His cool, calm demeanor really fit the character.

This movie takes us back to old school action that isn't 90% CGI like it is nowadays.  Once the action starts, it seems like it just doesn't stop until the very end.

The plot is simple. An ex-CIA agent's airhead daughter decides to take an innocent trip to Paris and gets herself into a mess of trouble. (Dad knew all along that it was a bad idea, but do they ever listen?) True to Dad's completely reasonable expectations, the daughter and her equally brainless girlfriend are immediately abducted by Albanian white slavers. Due to his CIA connections, Dad figures out who the slavers are in about three minutes, which gives you a whole hour to watch him kick, gouge, electrocute, shoot, and, in general, beat the living daylights out of the rest of the cast. Eventually, Dad finds the Arab sheik who has bought the silly girl for an outrageous (and totally unwarranted) amount of money, and there is a touching reunion--after Dad shoots the sheik. Then the happy pair fly back to California where a pop singer-

Hold on! Now wait just a cotton-picking minute! What about all the OTHER girls who were abducted while trying to get a taxi in Paris? Did Liam Neeson just leave them to their fate? Didn't some of them have well-to-do parents who might have kicked up a fuss? What about the ""hundreds"" of Albanian slave traders? I'm pretty sure Liam Neeson only killed... let me see...thirty or forty of them. How did he get on a plane after shooting all those people? Don't they have police in Paris?

OK, so it's an action flick. We can ignore all those little details. But the one thing you really can't get around is the fact that no way does a father rescue his daughter from white slavers in Paris without saying, ""I told you so.""",1258156800,8,1682,4.6375838926174495

He is very protective for her because of his training Thus he is extremely adverse to his daughter going with a friend to Paris for a vacation.

At first he totally refuses to give her permission but is pressure by both his daughter and ex-wife to sign the permission slip.  Of course the actual plans that the daughter has once she gets there is different.  She and her girlfriend let a stranger ride with them in a cab from the airport and it leads to a bunch of men breaking into the apartment where she is staying.

The daughter manages to call her father as the men break in and her tells her what is going to happen but if she follows his instructions, he will hopefully be able to find her.  The men take both girls and one actually taunts Neeson on the phone.  Neeson promises the attacker that he will track him down and kill him.

Neeson then dons a ""Jason Bourne"" personna and goes to Paris to find his daughter.  He is in a desperate race against the clock because that he is told that if he doesn't find her in 96 hours, it will be impossible to ever locate her.

Great action scenes and Neeson is relentless in his chase.  Though this movie has a lot of predictability it is still fun and Neeson does a good job playing his part.  An above average thriller!",1257984000,,1457,4.3161764705882355

5942292,3,B00ANT85VY,"Taken: 6 out of 10: Taken comes this close to being great. It had an admittedly rocky start with Liam Neeson is trying to reconnect with his virginal 17 year-old teenage daughter in a way that seems just on this side of creepy. (Dude get your own girlfriend... really)

Speaking of which; swarthy bad guys, who clearly have never heard of Nancy Grace, are kidnapping Rich American Girls and making them drugged out street walkers or selling them for millions to Arab Sheiks based on whether they are virgins or not.

So ex-CIA estranged father Liam Neeson has 96 hours to find his daughter before she is 'gone forever' deflowered and then burkaized apparently. 'A Fate Worse than Death' you can almost hear the characters thinking.

It's as if Charles Bronson was guest starring in an Ilsa the Wicked Warden film located in George C Scott's Hardcore and the entire enterprise was PG-13. And yet the film still works two thirds through. Liam Neeson is more than fine. He is kicking ass on all cylinders. It's the bad guys that drop the ball.

First a rich French guy starts quoting the Godfather. 'It's not personal it's business' For starters the quote isn't even in context. He might as well have told the gun toting Liam Neeson 'may the force be with you' for all the sense it makes. Second of all you can't quote the Godfather without referencing the fact that you are quoting it in the first place. Any screenwriter who does that should be sleeping with the fishes.

The second slap to the head is an Arab Sheik character that looked like he stepped out of a 1940's Bugs Bunny cartoon. Honestly I don't know where to begin on this silly stereotype. Why is he the film? Why does he have a knife to the white virgin's throat? Who would Oscar Schindler shoot????

The last point seems important since the Arab is basically a Juden in a dress. Same large noses, same aversion to pork, same living in ghettos in Europe (Or/and having all the money), same secret organizations paying off French politicians, same affinity to despoiling white Aryan virgins... The more things change the more the stay the same I guess. (They didn't have the Arab cook and eat a baby. I guess they are holding that back for the sequel)

Overt French xenophobia aside, Taken is a fun ride for most of the trip. (The dinner with his French policeman friend and Frenchman's wife was a particular highlight) And as I did mention Liam Neeson does kick ass.",1257379200,,2430,4.611111111111111

Well, there are only a couple of shots of Paris, and none worth a second glance -- that's all you get is a glance at anything, as the movie never stops rushing from one place to antoher, pausing only long enough for Neeson to dispose of an enemy in a few quick cuts.  There's no dialog worth mentioning in the entire movie, and the only subplot (with his French friend as part of the crime ring) so overused in detective/action movies it's blase now.  Liam Neeson's acting cannot overcome poor plot, poor dialog, poor filming, poor costuming, poor editing, and poor acting on every one else's part (his 17 year old daughter acts like she's six years old, even Famke Janssen is flat as his ex-wife).  The reason this is only an hour and a half is because of the total lack of content.

Action films when done right can be a great form of escapism, (The ""Die Hard"" Films, ""Face/Off"") however some are just plain bad, (""Wanted"" anyone?).

""Taken"" is a very and I mean very bare bones action flick that stars Liam Neeson (""Les Miserables"" ""Batman Begins"") as Bryan Mills a retired government agent who goes to look for the men who took his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, ""The Fog"" and T.V.'s ""Lost"") while she and a friend were on a trip in Paris.

Mills finds out from a longtime friend of his that these men take young traveling girls and sell them as prositutes on the black market. So with this information and a ticking clock off Mills goes.

After the first 30-35 minutes, the film is mainly one action sequence after another as Mills' search for his daughter takes him all over Paris and other parts of France, I'm guessing at least since a lot of loactions were never fully specified.

There's a really cool chase scene throughout a construction site where some men are holding some of the girls. Almost every action portion involves Mills using skills he learned over the years (basically how to kill) to get information and take down people to get his daughter back.

The action is great, fast paced and of course mostly ridiculous. The rest of the cast is made up of mostly throwaway characters and stereotypical bad guys, though Famke Janssen has a small role as Mills ex-wife and of course is Kim's mother.

Personally as silly and goofy as the film can be and is, it's a ton of fun and flies by quickly though given the 85 minutes running time it's not suprising. If you want non-stop bare bones action pick up ""Taken"" and enjoy. 3.5 out of 4 stars.",1253664000,,1690,4.576158940397351

I reviewed the fight sequences in slow motion and at speed and every move is something that would actually work. The style is not for Kung Fu enthusiasts, rather, it is based on the Applegate, Jim Grover, Fairbairn, styles of self defense that real bodyguards and experienced law enforcement use. There is even some grappling but practically applied (not MMA). The close quarters shooting is likewise realistic. I did not count rounds fired relative to each weapon but given that this is a work of fiction, unless you see fifty rounds come out of a semiautomatic without reloading, I can live with it.

Retired CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) hopes to restore his relationship with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and reluctantly agrees to let her travel to France with a friend. When Kim and her friend are kidnapped by slave runners, Bryan must resort to his special skills to scour the French underworld before she disappears forever. Though not a groundbreaking movie, ""Taken"" is an amusing action-packed thriller from director Pierre Morel (The Transporter) and producer Luc Besson (The Fifth Element). It was released in France in February of 2008 but was released in the United States in January of 2009.

Bryan Mills'(Neeson's) teenaged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) travels to Europe where she is stolen and sold into the sex trade.  The film was rated PG-13 but its content, vaguely glossed over for the most part, is anything but.  Quite graphic, the film relies on assumption, bloodless gunfire, and knife fights to push home the point that some people will justify any action to make money. The light treatment of such a horrific crime is somewhat an insult to the film's message. Given its themes the film would have been stronger if it had gone with an R rating, or at least more artfully hinted around disturbing content.  As it was it fell flat in engaging the audience into exactly what was going on, choosing to focus on pyrotechnics and paramilitary posturing.

Neeson is not on his game in this role, though he delivers a powerful, decisive father whose drive to save his daughter rivals the darkness of those he pursues.  This is the real story.  What is happening to his daughter is an afterthought, as is his own emotional involvement with what's happening.  That lack is why the feasibility of the story falls apart.  Grace portrays seventeen-year-old Kim more as if she was fourteen, rarely taking a step that she isn't skipping and pouncing like a puppy.  The need to convey her as being innocent and naive is overdone.  The only thing missing was pigtails.  Between the vague content and the over-acted archetypes of powerful father and innocent daughter, the result is this film turns a traumatic experience into an action-oriented thriller, his daughter's story largely lost beside his campaign for conquest.",1251072000,,1701,4.909090909090909
5942327,4,B00ANT85VY,"Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), the non-nonsense hero of Luc Besson-produced ""Taken,"" is someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Commando"" without one-liners. He is a gentle father (and retired special agent) who turns into an invincible war machine that no one can stop. After his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped in the Paris apartment, he flies to France and starts his ""investigation"" on his own.

Using the knowledge and skills he had learned in his former career, he chases every suspicious guy and corners him. To save his daughter, he runs and drives in the Paris streets (sometimes in the wrong side of the road); he beats up and shoots anyone who stands in his way. He's got only 96 hours before it is too late, and as I said before, this Jack Bauer-like former spy is played by Liam Neeson.

The 55-year-old Oscar-nominee veteran Liam Neeson, whose previous roles include Michael Collins, Alfred Kinsey and Oskar Schindler, is cast against type as the star of this tense action film. He is surprisingly convincing as a vengeful retired agent trying to rescue his daughter. Well, maybe this is not surprising because Liam Neeson is no stranger to action movies, previously seen in such films as ""Darkman"" ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" and ""Batman Begins."" He has worked with Sam Raimi, George Lucas and Christopher Nolan, and this is a quite impressive list.

""Taken"" wisely focuses on Liam Neeson's character. His charisma grabs your attention immediately, and with his riveting performances, some nice fights and the slick direction from Pierre Morel (""District B13"") the film is never boring. Supporting actors, however, are unmemorable or just annoying. Famke Janssen as Kim's mother and Bryan's separated wife only stands and looks worried before the camera. Maggie Grace (""LOST"") plays the spoiled daughter Kim, who is so irritating.

As far as the major plot holes go, few films can beat ""Taken"" (the script was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, a writing team for three ""Transporter"" films). This is a guilty pleasure you can enjoy only by suspending your disbelief. (Some characters seem to believe Bryan, who doesn't even speak a single French word, is a French police detective.) ""Taken"" is 90 minutes of fast-paced, unapologetic escapism and as such it delivers.",1250985600,,2323,5.057441253263708

Another Jack Bauer, a superman who can beat any number of assailants, who guns down approximately 300 of them in the course of this film, who is completely impervious to pain, who has no hesitation in resorting to torture, who has the most amazing luck and physical fortitude, and who rescues the fair damsel (in this case, his daughter) from nasty foreigners who talk funny. If one watches these sorts of espionage/agent films, be they Bond, Bauer, Bourne, whoever, one has to buy into the mythology that these people can really do these things, the way cowboy films required the acceptance of the fast draw that never existed and deadly accuracy from guns that couldn't hit a barn door from inside the barn.

Anyway, the plot is entirely predictable, the characters flat and the baddies completely dastardly (and therefore doomed). We won't even start on the many totally outrageous plot strands.

Unfortunately, she is kidnapped by slave-traders in Paris, and this is a race-against-time, as father pulls no stops to rescue his daughter. In a window of 96 hours, he has to engage his resourcefulness, military skillfulness, quick wits, and fearless conviction to battle a vicious European syndicate hell-bent on profit.

Neeson plays the role of the calm and composed father very well, and when he springs into action - he is vastly differently, and unpredictable. He is the equivalent of Jason Bourne (protagonist in the Bourne trilogy), except he is middle age. Neeson is still athletic, and he plays this character very well. The action scenes are well choreographed, and do justice for this action-thriller genre. The body count is very high, and the violence is real, although not gratuitous. It is not shot in the artistic style of John Woo in `A Better Tomorrow'. The scenes of how gullible girls are drugged and `traded' are disturbing.

The pacing is fast, so there is no `dead time'. This can be strongly attributed to the co-writer, auteur French director, Luc Besson (of `La Femme Nikita' and `Taxi' fame) who created a believable character and plot. The father-daughter relationship is the centerpiece of this gritty film, and the viewer will be encouraged to be optimistic and hopeful. There is nothing more powerful than parental love.

There's plenty of violence, though it's not over the top.  Most importantly, an action movie should succesfully create and maintain suspense and tension, and this one does that.

Liam Neeson does an excellent job playing the lead good guy, and his performance is perhaps the greatest strength of the movie.  Sterotypically, the bad guys are almost exclusively foreigners.  And the portrayal of the main daughter character is also weakened by stereotyping.

Overall, I can recommend this movie if you're looking for some decent action-oriented entertainment, and not expecting anything that will expand your horizons.",1250294400,,836,5.287878787878788
5942336,4,B00ANT85VY,"Taken / B001TODCII

*Spoilers*

I think it's probably safe to say that no one is going to be terribly surprised or thought-provoked by ""Taken"". The movie is straightforward and simple, almost quaintly so in an era where we've come to expect every movie to have a dramatic twist ending in which it turns out that an ancillary character (the best friend? the aging husband? the bitter wife?) was the actual mastermind behind everything. ""Taken"" has no such twists, partly because they've become a bit overdone in the movie industry, but mostly because such a twist would have undermined Neeson's hard-earned 'I told you so' as well as the (probably unintentional) movie subtext that pretty young women should never leave their fathers' homes - or for that matter the motherland.

Indeed, it's difficult to say how much of the movie is meant to be a searing attack on women... Neeson's ex-wife palatably drips evil and malice, and his darling daughter is almost a caricature of the stereotypical spoiled brat - throwing a temper tantrum that would shame a three-year-old when Daddy doesn't instantly sign off on an exotic European getaway. When the daughter and girlfriend are kidnapped into white slavery for being imprudent enough to flirt with an attractive stranger on a busy street in a foreign country, the sexually active girl dies almost immediately and is never mentioned again in the film. Neeson's daughter, on the other hand, is a pure-as-the-driven-snow virgin, allowing him a crucial extra few hours to try to save her as she is shuttled off to the expensive and exclusive 'virgin auction'. Although I'm probably reading WAY too much into the movie with all this subtext - after all, this is supposed to be a fun, mindless shoot-em-up, not a dissertation on the evils of society.

All tongue-in-cheek aside, ""Taken"" is a fine action movie if you're just looking for people to get blown up, shot, and run over by cars. Quite a few of the characters fail to act sensibly (like the slave-trader who is uncooperative for no reason at all except as a method to work in a torture scene), and some of the action feels a bit too pretentious - like a deliberate attempt to push the envelope. For example, when Neeson shots innocent people in order to get their loved ones to cooperate - the action doesn't make sense and simply doesn't fit the character, but we're out to push buttons here, not build a believable storyline. I recommend ""Taken"" for a fun, mindless action movie to pass the time, but I wouldn't waste too much time trying to find sense in it - this is a spectacle movie, not a philosophical one.

Like Tchaikovsky's music for Swan Lake, this film begins very quietly and continues to smoothly, evenly ramp up a cresendo to absolute ferosity.

You meet some of the people with whom he used to work and the frienships he's maintained. When his daughter wants to go to a trip to Paris with a friend you understand his reaction - and why he gives in. Everything is nailed down in the first act. No loose ends are left for later. The avantage of this unusual but obviously deliberate approach is that, as the cresendo continues and the action begins, there is nothing in the way. It's a straight line from what's this about to Whoa! I can breathe again. This would be a great action thriller by any measure.

5942339,4,B00ANT85VY,"Let me confess one thing at the start. I have got the blu-ray of Taken, but I have so far been unable to watch it. But I did watch the Digital Copy that came with it, installed on my PC, during a plane ride. One thing I noticed was that the Digital Copy was of very good quality, with little or no artefacts despite the many night scenes.
My first impression was, who would have thought Liam Neeson would make such a good hero ? Credit goes to whoever took the decision to cast him as Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA type with deadly skills. His daughter's kidnappers in Paris would learn what these skills are as the film progresses from one action scene to another. It barely pauses, except for the initial 20 minutes when there's not much action.
There have been a number of `rescue-your-kidnapped-daughter' films, most noticeably Man on Fire and Commando. These two featured much younger daughters than Taken. But in the end, Taken is more emotionally satisfying (if you can use that term for a film in which around 50 people get killed) than either of them.
I saw somewhere on the Net Taken being described as a `horror' film. Yes, it is a nightmare for parents for if their offpring is `Taken' by kidnappers.  Neeson is superb as the distraught father, though his acting won't win Oscars in a film like this. The storyline, though containing some plot holes, is believable. Trafficking in young women is a serious problem especially in poorer countries, though the West is not immune, as depicted in the film. Taken producers deserve thanks for highlighting this problem.
Taken is a thrill ride you will not forget in a hurry. The camerawork is excellent, the action sequences are brilliant and the dialogues are snappy. Action must be Taken to buy this film.",1249689600,,1756,4.646302250803859

So I was VERY disappointed to see the reason why they kidnapped her. Yes, I understand that is a real problem in this world but I would've liked to have seen spies after him. There were ""edge of your seat"" moments but not enough to make me want to watch the movie again. I'd rather give it 2 1/2 stars but that's not on the menu so to speak.

First of all, not for one second did I believe Neeson was the father of that girl.  It just didn't feel real at all.  Second he was so earnest and good that he's not a believable character.  Never really gets angry...he's just this warm ray of goodness in all he does.

Then the action ramps up.  Some of it didn't excite me; in particular there's a car chase that really bored me.  I also wish he would have been more passionate in disposing of the bad guys.  If I were slaughtering the men that stole my daughter, you can be sure I would have enjoyed it.

The whole time I was imagining how much better say...a smart-allecky Bruce Willis would have fit the bill.

I do have to say...there is one REALLY good ""Oh ****!"" moment that I won't spoil for anybody.  Man that was great.  But it doesn't make the film for me.

And then the end...not to give anything away...but it just seemed pointless, tacked on and hokey.  The emotional core of this film just isn't there.

If you're really desperate for some gunshot wounds and broken bones then this will do.  But I can't recommend it to anyone...except my parents.  They're a sucker for any thriller.",1248912000,,1183,4.402777777777778

5942352,5,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson is a tremendous actor and I was intrigued when I saw he was in this movie.  Though he has done many roles, I often associate him more with roles such as Michael Collins, Schindler's List and Gangs of New York, as oppossed to more the action roles - though of course he has done turns in those types of movies.

This is a CIA/spy type movie where Liam plays a retired operative whose daughter decides to take a trip to Paris.  As a concerned (divorced) father the premise and relationships are set up nicely at the beginning (with some good scenes of Liam hanging out with his spy friends).  He is really just a normal guy who wants good things for his daughter and is clearly caring for her.  The birthday present and shopping scene was great, not to mention the presentation of the present.  Then his daughter is kidnapped shortly after the arrival in France.

Of course there is the element of spy power, guns and exploisions, but there are so many good scenes that it all works well.  The phone convervastion he has with the kidnappers at the very beginning - you believe every word he says.

Overall a very well done movie with good plot elements, but which does not tie itself down in trying to make the plot too winding and difficult to follow.  Enough twists to keep it entertaining, enough action to keep things moving and ultimately a set of charactors that you wind up caring for and beleiving.

This is quite simply a comic book superhero disguised as a human being.  Liam Neeson is better than this and I'm frankly surprised he accepted this absurd role.

C'mon folks, look at the film for what it tries to tell you.  This guy travels to Paris and within minutes finds his daughter's first contact.  He then miraculously walks right in on the bad guy's lair and proceeds to shoot them all without a scratch on himself.

He then plays tough guy with these elite movers and shakers of the slave trade and manages to shoot them too, while jumping onto their boat off of a bridge.

I was hesitant about the film because it dealt with kidnapping women for the sex trade.  I don't want any porn (or soft porn) in my life so I try to avoid sex and nudity in films.

The film dealt with the female sex slave trade very discreetly and amazingly there was no tantalizing nudity in the film.  (My wife and I are very happy about this).

The only negative thing about the film is the blasphemy.  When the girl is abducted she uses the famous ""OMG"" about 6 times... and the father records the event and listens to it many times.  As a rule I think we should avoid blasphemy, but under the circumstances calling on God seems understandable.

5942357,3,B00ANT85VY,"Bryan Mills is a retired CIA operative whose seventeen-year-old daughter is kidnapped by a bunch of Albanian white-slave traffickers the moment she arrives in Paris.  Instantly, Mills launches into secret agent mode, utilizing all the tricks-of-the-trade he picked up during his years in the service to single-handedly track down his daughter and bring her abductors to justice.  Clearly, James Bond has nothing on this guy.

As action thrillers go, ""Taken"" is considerably less plausible than most (which is saying a great deal), filled as it is with preposterous coincidences and feats of superhuman dexterity, but director Pierre Morel does know how to get the adrenaline pumping - which, let`s face it, is all one really asks for from a high-octane popcorn movie such as this one.

To make the movie more ""relatable"" for the audience, screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen have concocted a rather dreadful scenario in which Mills has quit his job and moved to California so he will be able to spend more time with his daughter, only to find that he now has to compete with her gazillionaire step daddy for her attention and affection.  But all that malarkey is done away with in the early stages and - good news for action fans - once the movie hits the throttle, it never lets up.

The European tourism industry is bound to take something of a hit with this film - and, seriously, all of this just to get some rich guys laid?  Don`t they have just regular old call-girls in Paris anymore? - but the commercial success of the movie has been nothing less than a godsend for Liam Neeson's career and pocketbook.

Using fighting skills (equally choreographed to Bourne's IMHO) from his former life as a protector, he makes his way through the bad guys in this perfectly paced action flick.  While he's almost too super human, receiving few injuries, the film still delivers simply because Neeson is that convincing and owns the screen.

He is completely believable as the retired CIA assassin who goes to great lengths to return his kidnapped daughter.  Now granted that suspension of belief is key to any movie but Taken really tests this. For one thing, no one but Neeson's character seems to be able to shot straight and he is mysteriously impervious to bullets.

Also, he can overcome any security system and much like the Rambo movies, if there is a place guarded by 100 armed men, he can take it single handily. The other characters are superfluous and the other friend who goes to Paris with Maggie Grace might as well have one of the old Star Trek red shirts because we know she's going to be sacrificed to show how bad these dudes are.

It is worth watching again over a phone while waiting in line etc.  The movie itself is headed by what I would describe as a real actor.  Some may disagree but Liam is super in this role.  His character almost appears real.  Almost because he is such a wimp when it comes to his ex and his daughter.

5942371,5,B00ANT85VY,"The premise of a kidnapped child rescued by an incredibly skilled father has become something of a film genre over the past three decades, with the parent usually portrayed by an action movie icon (Bruce Willis, Charles Bronson, John Wayne, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example). The latest addition to the category, ""Taken"", treads on familiar ground, but succeeds in breathing fresh life into the concept through the unusual casting of Liam Neeson as a retired special ops agent; eschewing glamor for gritty determination, Neeson is so good that the film becomes a homage to not only the genre, but to a father's devotion to his child in an increasingly dangerous world.

Neeson is clearly a dinosaur, not only among the flashy, media-savvy operatives of the intelligence community, but as a parent, as well; his over-protectiveness of his daughter is scoffed at by his ex-wife (Famke Janssen), and his ongoing surveillance has a nearly creepy quality. Yet when his instructions are ignored, and his daughter is abducted by a white slavery ring in France, Neeson quickly proves himself to be their worst nightmare, a relentless, unforgiving adversary.

While a legitimate argument can be made that the story's resolution is too 'sugar-coated' and pat, it does provide an optimism that is too often lacking in recent films, and I enjoyed it...

I loved it.  So much in fact that I bought the Blu-ray the day it was released.

Neeson plays such a likable character, he's put into a situation that's easy to see yourself in.  Bryan Mills (Neeson) is a retired CIA operative who has a less than stellar relationship with his daughter.  He decides to be the good guy for once and agrees to let her travel to France.  She eventually becomes kidnapped and sucked into the human trafficking world.  This is where the excitement picks up, Mills travels to France and puts his CIA skills to use hunting down his daughter and killing anyone who gets in his way.

Lets get onto the Blu Ray specs.  The film looks great, the grain isn't too bad, the image looks very sharp.  The audio is perfect, you're going to hear every gun shot, every punch.  The audio is full of depth and sounds great on a 5.1 system.  The supplements are good as well, you get two audio commentaries, two featurettes (both shot in HD), script to screen, a digital copy, and a Black Opps Field Manual which I believe to be exclusive to the Blu-ray.

His concern about his daughter's trip to Europe turns out to be correct when she is kidnapped, and he spends most of the movie doing whatever it takes to rescue her.  The rage and violence that Neeson shows is credible in light of the brutal kidnapping of his daughter, allowing him to be more complex than the heroes in many action thrillers. The action is non-stop and includes some great sequences.  The subplot involving police corruption adds to the story instead of bogging things down, and emphasizes that Neeson is on his own with his rescue mission.

See it for yourself; you won't be disappointed.  Liam Neeson is outstanding in this intense, but satisfying thriller about a father whose daughter is kidnapped while vacationing in Europe.  Unfortunately for the bad guys, Neeson makes Jason Bourne look like a pussy cat as he tries to get her back.  The action scenes are excellent, but violent.

Some have criticized this movie for not pausing to question the morality of Neesom's rampage, but ""Taken"" has a very raw and straightfoward purpose - to connect the viewer emotionally to Neeson as he singelmindedly pursues his daughter.  I get the sense the filmmakers recognize that at some point, with all of us, family and paternal bonds trump moral dilemmas.

I think every teenage girl and young woman should see this movie. Both Amanda and Kim, the two teenage girls portrayed in the movie were very naive and too trusting and therefore easy prey for the sex slave merchants. Their actions practically said ""take me, I am here alone in a strange city with no one to protect me"". Not every young female is going to have an ex-CIA dad to save them.

What I liked about Liam Neeson character is even after his daughter and her friend were kidnapped, he didn't berate his wife with ""I told you so, you just didn't listen"". He seemed more interested in getting his daughter back safe rather than making his ex feel guilty and foolish.",1245974400,,931,4.43859649122807

5942392,3,B00ANT85VY,"This movie seems to follow a pattern of action movies in recent years...dark, gloomy, serious. What happened to movies like the James Bond movies with Roger Moore? They were ENTERTAINING. The Bourne movies...another example. They're great action flicks, but kind of one-dimensional. Everybody's serious, dark...ready to either kill somebody else or their own self at any moment. ""Taken"" is like that.

OK, I can understand the constant seriousness if the movie is portrayed to be generally realistic. After all, there is nothing humorous or entertaining about a teenage daughter being kidnapped. However, this movie is definitely NOT realistic, almost to the point of being laughable. I wish I had a dollar for every bullet that missed Mills (Neeson's character) that was pointed straight at him. And I'm trying to decide which was more unrealistic...Mills' ability to dodge bullets or the stupidity of his ex-wife and his daughter's friend. Total airheads! (Well, on second thought I guess there are people that stupid out there.) The movie, while definitely action-packed and exciting in many places, just seemed to move too fast (not surprisingly, it's only 90 minutes).

Anyway, this flick is great for a QUICK action movie, but just not ""well rounded"" enough for me.",1245888000,2,1271,5.25615763546798

About the only thing I couldn't handle in the film, are the scenes when his daughter is running in the house...she looked as though she had a handicap.

For those who don't know, ""Taken"" is about a ex-CIA agent who has retired to spend more time with his teenage daughter. When his ex-wife and daughter convince him to let her go to Paris, he's wary of it, still the usual overprotective dad, but agrees to let her go. Of course, she gets kidnapped and he has to go find her and save her. Simple plot, lots of action, lots of cool, revenge-driven dialogue, and one of my favorite actors Liam Neeson.

THIS is the Father's Day gift that any dad (especially for ones with daughters as I can speak from experience) would appreciate. My only problem with the story is the very ending. I can't really say too much without giving it away, but all this stuff happens and then at the very end, SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT: Neeson and his daughter carry on almost as if the trauma never happened.

After, there are more suspense/thriller movies that make a good trailer and that is about all.  However, I must say I thorougly enjoyed the movie and thought Liam Neeson was great.

Of course, you have to be willing to let a few unbelievable coincidences and plot liberties slide, but by and large this made for some very entertaining and captivating time.  I will say, it was also difficult to watch from the standpoint that there are plenty of depressing and sick reports to confirm the growth of a worldwide sex slave trade run by crime syndicates.  I give the movie credit for tackling a tough and important issue without being gratuitous or also downplaying the reality of the problem.  Lastly, I thought the movie hit the right time limit to keep it from becoming absurd or repetitive.  Many films like ""Taken"" often go 15-30 minutes too long, trying to squeeze out more drama and achieve nothing but diminishing returns.

5942400,5,B00ANT85VY,"I picked this up to watch and then read some of the reviews on Amazon about it.  Thank goodness I ignored what most of the naysayers had to write about this one.  I found it highly entertaining, fast paced, and in its own weird way, a sweet story.  The people that say the daughter is a brat, I don't know where they got that from.  She is a naive, slightly goofy 17 year old who at the last minute realizes she got herself in some deep trouble.  She treats her dad (Liam) with respect, and yes, her dad is protective and a bit behind the times, but he is exactly what a dad should be.

  And about the violence and body count.  Yep, Liam kills some people.  But each of his 'victims' was tied into the sex slavery business and knew exactly what was going on.  Plus, most were trying to kill him too.  The bad guys didn't mind killing innocent ones, so  they shouldn't have been surprised when their time came.

  Some complained about the pipe scene and the shooting of a wife (I don't wanna give too much info away), but if you actually watch the movie, listen to the dialogue, those scenes made sense and worked fine.  Sure, if you missed a few lines of dialogue about why the woman got a flesh wound, then it would seem a bit harsh.
  I watched this with my teenager, yeah, it was chancy I guess, but she enjoyed it and wants to see more adventure movies.  It had a few bits of dialogue she didn't need to hear, but was otherwise pretty clean, except some blood here and there.  This did not bore us like Mall Cop and Bedtime Stories.

5942403,4,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson lets loose a mean dose of delicious thuggery in Taken, a taut thriller that puts the viewer in the passenger seat right next to a hell-bent father seeking his stolen daughter and the blood of those behind her abduction. Deftly directed by District B13's Pierre Morel from a script by Luc Besson and writing partner Robert Mark Kamen, this tense actioner doesn't spend much time setting things up, nor does it decelerate once the flick picks up steam. Not one to overstay its welcome, this suspenseful tale is an economic exercise in delivering the goods for those who are interested in a two-fisted Liam Neeson vehicle to soak up, bask in, and then leave behind as soon as it's over. Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA agent who's left behind the service to help care for his teenaged daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), even if she spends most of her time with his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and her wealthy husband, Stuart (Xander Berkeley). Mills shows off his competence in combat early on after thwarting an attempt on the life of pop star Sheerah (Holly Valance), whom his daughter idolizes. Soon after, the 17-year-old is off to Paris, but only once she agrees to a strict set of rules, namely that the family knows where she is at all times. Plans derail when Kim is kidnapped while she's checking in on the phone with her father, who coolly deals with the situation and stays on the line long enough to deliver a killer speech to her captors. What follows is Mills' one-man mission to get his daughter back within 96 hours, using whatever European contacts he has left and the special lethal skills he's quite adept at dishing out. And dish them out Neeson does. Audiences get a clear idea of what sort of pain is in store for the bad guys early on during the pop-star rescue, which sets up the kind of swift brutality this character is capable of. The actor finds a cool partner in Morel, who delivers the action with a satisfyingly steady hand -- especially in the knife-fight finale, where a full-frame, one-take technique is honored in order to pay off the claustrophobic cabin setting without resorting to superficial style to keep the audience's juices flowing. In the acting department, Neeson is a single-minded, stone-faced wonder -- ready to pummel whoever needs to be knocked down in order to get to his daughter. As the daughter, Grace fulfills the dual nature of her character's arc, delivering both doe-eyed innocence and wide-eyed hysteria with competence. Sadly, Famke Janssen gets lost in the shuffle for most of the film, though to be fair, this flick isn't as much about the mother back home, but the trained torturer dad who'll stop at nothing to bust some slave-trader butt. Taken might still be on the fluffy side (the emotional beats, especially, feel forced), but it is of a higher pedigree than what action buffs have come to expect from French movie mogul Besson, whose post-directorial writer/producer stints range from the Transporter films to the tongue-in-explosive-cheek Taxi series. While cinephiles certainly won't flock to the flick, the inclusion of Neeson will hopefully tip some audiences off to the fact that there's something a little more to this intimate package than just your normal whiz-bang-pow big-budgeted romp. For fans of tough cinema, this is an installment worthy of comparison to the British crime films of old, which certainly share the narrow-minded propulsion of the plot, as well as having a venerable lead to chew the scenery as he pummels his way through a mystery. Needless to say, if you happen to be snatched up against your will, you could do a lot worse than have a Liam Neeson type waiting in the wings to brutalize his way to your rescue. ~ Jeremy Wheeler, All Movie Guide",1245542400,,3762,4.816074188562596
5942404,2,B00ANT85VY,"""Taken"" poses a number of fascinating questions, but provides few answers to discerning viewers. The many issues raised by this provocative film are:

1. Will a gang of eastern European thugs and white slaving kidnappers, living in Paris, accept a middle aged, former American CIA agent with a thick Irish accent as a Paris policeman, just because he shows them a French Police ID that he stole with a French name on it?

2. Can an American just arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris involve himself in a violent manic foot chase and wild fight with another man all over the arrival area of the airport, resulting in the death of the man being chased, and then suddenly appear in central Paris without much interest from the French police?

3. Can the distance between two nearly adjacent bridges in Paris be stretched enough to allow for a lengthy car chase that is really unnecessary because the hero could have walked to the next bridge in less time than the car chase takes?

4. Can an American, former CIA agent, with a thick Irish accent, pretending to be a Paris policeman, leap from the Pont des Artes onto a passing yacht and NOT have the yacht be filled with evil, Arab mobsters?

5. Can a movie involving a good but hard to get along with American former CIA agent, with a thick Irish accent, with a gorgeous ex-wife who has left him for a rich guy, possibly get to the end of the movie without the ex-wife admitting that her rejected former husband is a worthy man, a good man, a man she should have treated better and appreciated more?

6. Can the daughter of an American former CIA agent be kidnapped in Paris and turned into a drugged out, white slave whore for Arab mobsters and forced into prostitution, then saved by Dad in a bloodbath on the Seine, quickly get back to life as usual when Dad drops her off at the now appreciative ex-wife's house in Beverly Hills; will Mom & the American, former CIA agent with a thick Irish accent, reconcile?

These issue are profound, and frankly the answers are hard to come by from the film itself. It's worth thinking about, seriously...",1245542400,12,2103,4.5476190476190474
5942405,4,B00ANT85VY,"This is perhaps the best action-thriller to come along since the BOURNE movies.  It has a good, straight-forward plot, characters that we care about and action sequences that may, at times, get a bit ""over the top,"" but never to the point of being ridiculous.

Liam Neeson stars as a retired CIA agent, working an occasional security gig, who is forced back into action when his teenage daughter is kidnapped by white slavers while she is visiting Paris with a friend.  Liam knows that he has only 96 hours in which to find the girl before she disappears forever, and the French authorities are no help whatsoever.  In fact, many of them, are corrupt and on the payroll of the kidnappers.

Like DEATH WISH, Taken is one of those movies where you actually cheer when Neeson kills one of the bad guys...and he kills a lot of them.

5942412,5,B00ANT85VY,"The Liam Neeson/Luc Besson action film ""Taken"" pairs the Academy Award-nominated actor and noted action film director, writer, and producer in a story that focuses on the human trafficking network in Europe where young girls are forced into a life of drugs and prostitution.

Neeson plays Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA operative who has retired to spend more time with his daughter, played by Maggie Grace. Mills spent most of his career around the world pursuing danger, so much so that he ended up being divorced by his wife, played by Famke Janssen. Janssen has remarried a wealthy businessman, and her relationship with Mills is still frosty. Right after her 18th birthday, Mills' daughter asks for his signature on a permission form to travel to Europe with a 19-year old female friend. Mills balks, but after tears and a cajoiling from his ex, Mills signs the paperwork.

No sooner does she get settled in her guest accomodations that the daughter is kidnapped by an Albanian group trafficking in young girls from overseas. Mills springs into action, and travels to France, where he becomes a one-man wrecking crew bent on finding his daughter and returning her to safety.

Neeson handles the action scenes adroitly, and since this is already his territory, Besson and his director, Pierre Morel, produce a high-octane film that is fun, entertaining, and even manages to put a spotlight on a problem that is beginning to draw attention worldwide.

In addition to the riveting action, the subleties and no-so subleties of beign a divorced parent on the outside are handled accurately and poignantly. All in all, Taken is a great action film with a number of nice nuances around the edges.",1245283200,,1686,4.968085106382978

Neeson intimidates, maims and kills every bad guy in his way. Taken has no use for its PG-13 rating: only the absence of blood and graphic violence keep this flick just barely from getting the R.

The movie has nice action sequences, a lovely setting and some intense moments, but ultimately is too implausible and sometimes even silly. The acting is marginal, and the plot has some large holes. That said, watching scumbags get blown away by a grim-faced and seemingly indestructible angel of vengeance dad is fun enough--especially if you enjoy popcorn action flicks (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Commando/dp/B000RW3VCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Commando</a>&nbsp;anyone?!?). Just be aware of what you're getting here: this is 80 minutes of bad-guy beat-downs with a plot exists simply to try and pull it all together.

Neeson plays an ex-CIA 'preventer' turned remorseful dad trying to earn back his daughter's affections in typically silly single-dad ways. When she decides to head to Paris with her teenybopper, valley-girl friend, overprotective dad begrudgingly agrees to let her go, but lays down some rules, and gives her an international cell phone to call him with each morning and night (something he might have learned in a previous career as a parole officer). Of course things go horribly awry and the girls are kidnapped by some deviant Albanian sex-traders. Albanians appear to be the new Russians in post cold-war thriller movies. I guess the Russians deserve a break; they had a good run.

The first 30 minutes of the film are spent on the set-up, and by the time Neeson finally lands in Paris and starts to administer a few butt-kickings, my response was 'it's about freakin time!' since I had been led to believe this was in fact a thriller/action flick, not a commentary on overprotective, guilt ridden fathers and their whining, uncoordinated daughters--Remember when I said the acting was marginal at best? Maggie Grace who plays daughter Kim, spends most of her screen time awkwardly running from place to place, arms and legs akimbo-- or yet another divorced dad/mom are both jerk stories.

The story thunders forward with all the subtlety of a freight train running off its rails as Neeson beats up roomfuls of villains with an ease that makes the viewer believe he could probably still do it with one arm tied behind his back. He is also most definitely a marksman; I believe he never misses who he's aiming at through the entire film--in fact he seems to administer single shot kills like Kobe drains three-pointers. Overall, his amazing marksmanship and Batman like superiority even in 10-1 combat scenarios are what really destroyed the movie for me: there is never a time when the viewer is forced to worry for Neeson. There is no 'burden' on the viewer to pull for him. We already know what's going to happen.

In the entire film, Neeson is in real jeopardy for about 3 seconds. That's right, three seconds. That is during a brief stint as a captive in the basement of Mr. St-Clair (by far the movies most compelling baddy, a sort of super-pimp selling girls to the worlds richest scum bags) before he immediately locates an escape route and continues with his reign of holy terror. It is also St-Clair who tells Neeson ""You have to understand, it was always only business,"" to which Neeson replies ""It was all personal to me,"" a classic one-liner for which I've bumped the movie up a half star. It made me laugh.

If there is one thing that Neeson's character is not, it's conflicted about doing what's necessary to find and save his daughter. He is as unconcerned with torture as he is with collateral damage or even shooting a complete innocent in the arm just to prove a point. Nothing is more important than saving his daughter, and while that might make him a pretty awful neighbor in real life, it comes across as refreshing in a Hollywood environment where soul-anguished mamby-pamby heroes seem to be all the rage.

By the film's conclusion, Neeson has succeeded in killing probably about a 100 thugs, creeps, perverts, and scum bags. --SPOILER WARNING!-- He's got his daughter back, is safe in the States, and has even earned the respect of his Ex and her Mr. Monopoly husband. Not bad. However, it was all so easy, so painless (for Neeson at least!), and the darker underpinnings of the movie handily swept under the rug (like the fate of Kim's valley-girl friend or the implications of ends-justify-the-means torture) that watching Kim head off to voice lessons with a Jewel/Brittany hybrid in the obligatory Hollywood ending is just too sappy & stupid for my tastes.

2.5/5 Stars. Silly in many ways, but there is some fun to be had watching jerks getting head-shotted by an angry Uber Dad. Too bad it wasn't built around a better plot with a bit more intelligence (something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Punisher/dp/B000XHSL9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Punisher</a>&nbsp;but directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Hugh Jackman--Now that I would happily pay to see).",1245024000,3,5210,5.277442702050664

5942425,3,B00ANT85VY,"I thought Luc Besson directed this, but it turns out he is the producer (and a writer). I do like some of Besson's movies, particularly Femme Nikita and The Professional. Likewise, I've always felt Liam Neeson's films had a certain level of class.

Taken is written at a surface level. The characters are not developed very deeply, and the movie is mostly about intrigue and action -- a bit of the former, but mostly the latter. Action is of the Jason Bourne type -- walk into a roomful of bad guys and render them all helpless in 15 seconds. A little unrealistic for a man of any age, let alone Neeson's. Think Indiana Jones in revenge mode.

As a pure action movie, it is competent and exciting, if a bit formulaic. I'm afraid that I've seen enough of these types of films that the sheer kinetic energy of some of the scenes is not enough for me. I think a quieter, more sleuth-like sniffing out the trail leading to the hero's kidnapped daughter would have been more dramatic, even if it induced less adrenalin. And a lower body count, with slower kills of the really really bad guys might actually have been more cathartic.

The ending seemed a bit abrupt. For example, there's no exposition on how the French authorities cleaned up the messes our hero exposes and leaves behind, and how they deal with the corruption in their midst. I wanted to see that resolved.

And while the cause seems just, I'm still just a bit uncomfortable with the special forces-style vigilantism that is glorified here.

If you don't want to think too hard, and watch a lot of nameless sinister folk get quickly shot or pummelled into submission, Taken will occupy you for an evening.",1244937600,4,1667,4.5993265993265995

5942427,4,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson has never made a bad movie in my estimation; he is a phenomenal actor.  Though the subject matter is rough (trafficking of young naive women); the action and plot is riveting.

Liam Neesom plays a newly retired and lonely agent; he gave up his career because he loved his daughter more.  He was very good at his job but appears to be vulnerable now and weak because he is without career, family, and everything he once held dear.  His wife has moved on to greener pastures and he is left trying to pick up the crumbs of his former existence.  His friends still hold him in high regard and try to get him to give life and his talents another shot.

When his daughter and his former wife lie to him about an upcoming European jaunt, the situation goes from bad to worse and Liam has to leap in and save the day.  While attempting to save his daughter and balance the scorecard; he seems to rediscover himself and his daughter along the way.  Despite some of the subject matter (which I do not believe is appropriate for the younger audience) the plot and the action is fast paced, real and powerful.

Liam Neesom's character is named Bryan Mills, his daughter Kimmie is played by Maggie Grace who I think does a very good job in the role (although some other reviewers have disagreed).  Taken was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and directed by Pierre Morel. Luc Besson who is known for his action films Transporter trilogy and The Professional comes through in spades with Taken.  You may have a difficult time judging whether Bryan Mills is good or bad; what you discover is that in his job he has become a bit of both.  I think he could have played James Bond with aplomb.  After seeing this film,  I am convinced that he would have been a match for that role.

I have to say that the sex trade is usually not my type of film; but this movie reeled me in and I found it exciting, well acted and unfortunately very believable; it is funny how many of us discoonect from the sordidness that is a reality out there in our everyday existence and just live in our cocoon day in and day out.

5942430,4,B00ANT85VY,"Leem Neeson is fantastic.  He's the entire film and it's worth your time.  I kept thinking of Charles Bronson, with class and an accent.  This film could have been 1979 with me and my friends at our hometown drive-in cheering on Neeson dispensing justice as he searches for his daughter.  It's also a throwback to those older films because it's virtually devoid of gore.  It's violent as all heck, but it spares the viewer the typical modern producer's fascination with super slow-mo, buckets of blood, flesh specks and mini-cams strapped to bullets.  It leaves that aspect to our imagination and thanks to other films, imagination is quite enough to drive home what he's doing.  Human trafficking is a horrendous crime that's taking place every day all over the world.  It was a real pleasure to see Leem Neeson taking several dozen of them out.

5942431,5,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson channels the best (and worst) of Charles Bronson to make TAKEN a riveting, chilling and unforgettable vigilante tale.  Retired from the CIA, his divorced-dad character knows all the dangers that lurk in the world. But he can't quite convince his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and 17-year-old daughter (Maggie Grace, last seen on Lost) to take his ""worst-case scenario"" fears seriously.  Until they all come true.  He's on the phone with his vacationing-in-Paris daughter when she is, indeed, taken by a violent gang of drug dealing sex slave traders.  This scene is handled with such a tragic, heart-stopping sense of reality that the viewer is primed to forgive Neeson anything in his quest to find her.  With just enough clues and former-CIA connections to speed his against-the-clock chase, Neeson blazes through Paris with a deadly focus and a brutal efficiency.  He's willing to use hands, guns and electricity to equally lethal effect.  And he's fortunate that he has what appears to be a force field around him that makes it impossible for the bad guys to shoot him, no matter how many thousands of bullets they fire.

5942436,4,B00ANT85VY,"This review might seem a little contradictory to anyone who recently read my `Quantum of Solace' review.  These two films are virtually the same movie (not plot wise, but in the idea that they are all action, very little character development) and yet I'm giving this one an extra star.

Why?

Well, as anyone who has read my review of `Quantum of Solace' knows, I expected a lot more out of that film.  In fact, `Taken' delivers exactly what I expected it to, and in some areas even more; yet, while `Quantum of Solace' basically offers me the same thing it fails to live up to the hype spilling over from `Casino Royale'.

`Taken' tells of a former spy Bryan Mills who has given up his former life in order to try and regain a relationship with his teenage daughter Kim.  His ex-wife Lenore makes that extremely difficult by constantly degrading him and purposefully keeping him out of reach of his little girl (well, not so little anymore).  When his daughter wishes to go to Paris with a girlfriend Bryan feels it is a mistake, but under immense pressure from Lenore he gives in and allows Kim to go only to regret the decision almost immediately when his daughter is kidnapped in order to be sold into prostitution.  Bryan then embarks on a mission of his own to track down and kill the men responsible for this crime and rescue his daughter.

The film is brisk and exciting and always engaging; filled with one action scene after another.  While this is nothing special or extraordinary, it never lets one down.  The thing about `Taken' is that it actually delivers what it promises.  No one going into this is expecting a drawn out character study, and while they know that Bryan is worried about his daughter they are not expecting a father/daughter bonding film.  They are expecting things to blow up, people to get shot and their attention to be kept.

`Taken' delivers on all fronts.

Liam Neeson is a surprisingly adept action star (he should do more films like this one) and he carries this film from beginning to end.  He is intriguing, attractive and heroic; all the qualities needed to make a film like this work.

In fact, `Taken' is so good at what it does that I was tempted to give it an A, if not for the last three minutes or so.  Yes, an action film that for once appeared virtually flawless falls to ridiculous pieces right before the final credits begin to roll.  I won't spoil the films ending for you here, but I will say that it is not what happens but how it happens that upset me.  The film had a real sense of gritty realism, even if the majority of the action sequences were highly implausible.  The thing is, the films handling of the emotional reaction to this type of tragedy was beyond ridiculous and almost insulting.

Like I said, it's the last three minutes.  Until that point, the film works wonderfully.

So, I highly recommend this one despite the ending.  It is one tightly woven action film that delivers the thrills it promises and then some.  Liam is perfectly cast (and I was iffy about that one going in) and Pierre Morel's direction is impeccable.",1244678400,,3096,4.5533453887884265
5942437,1,B00ANT85VY,"""Taken"" is so lackadaisical in laying out its backstory---Liam Neeson is a retired CIA heavy, his wife has left him for a richer, wussier man, and his daughter chafes at his overprotective ways---that by the time the daughter is kidnapped you're rooting for the baddies to take her already just to get things underway.  The pace picks up once they do, and you get something like your money's worth as Neesom jets off to Paris and sets about gunning down a small army of oily Albanian white slavers.  With its implacably violent avenging father in foreign country premise, the rest of the movie plays out like a really stupid version of ""The Limey"".  However, the bad guys are so cartoonishly bad, and Neesom's craggy-faced James Bond so dully invulnerable, that the movie has no sense of danger to gin up the righteousness it needs.  It's just a grind until eighty minutes later (Spolier Alert!) Neesom gets his daughter back.

No vigilante movie worth its salt should let you get away without feeling morally compromised.  ""Dirty Harry"" is brilliant precisely because it sticks a toe over the line into fascism.  ""Taken"" made me feel queasy too, but not because I was empathizing with Neesom's paternal killing machine.  He's a resentful hang-dog divorcee so overprotective that he thinks that flying to Paris is asking for it, whose love for his daughter is all bound up with a need to infantilize and control her, all of that laid over a core of suppressed ultra-violence.

5942441,3,B00ANT85VY,"Taken is basically a more intelligent version of any Steven Segal or Jean-Claude Van Damme movie.  It is basically senseless action, but without 99% of the [...] that makes a Van Damme film so horrible, and regretable.
Those types of movies have their use, so I don't mean to disrespect them too much.  Sometimes you want just a reckless revenge tale, without the cerebral stimulation, or good dialogue...or believeable situations.

I want to point out that in the opening scenes of the movie --home video of the daughter opening gifts on her birthday-- the film's score plays two lines of music that sounds like a note-for-note rip off of Clint Mansell's score to The Fountain.  I don't know if Nathaniel Mechaly (Taken's composer) did this as an ode to Mansell or not, but it was so strikingly similar I paused the movie and brought up the final track on The Fountain's soundtrack: Together We Will Live Forever (the melody that appears about 51 seconds in) just to make sure.  I rewound and played the film's version again, then played The Fountain track. Identical. Taken's version is even in the same key!!

So while the themes, plot points, motivations, and even the score of Taken are not original or unique, they take what a lot of horribly executed movies (Segal and Van Damme) try to do and Taken one-ups them.

No. Luc Besson (""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Professional,"" The ""Transporter"" series), who co-wrote the screenplay and more or less breathed life into this thing as producer likes his action scenes big, and his hit men sentimental-yet-efficient.

And Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, is certainly that. He's divorced from his wife (Famke Janssen) for logging too many hours in hot zones for the CIA, and since she's remarried to, of course, a billionaire (Xander Berkeley, not the villain, if you're guessing), Bryan has idealized his gangly, selfish daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), and transformed her into his Reason For Living.

But Kim cons him into signing a release so she can go to Paris with her slightly older, sluttier friend. It's only Bryan's zeal for worrying about every little detail - she forgets to call him upon landing in France, so he calls her - that allows him to hear his daughter getting kidnapped by Albanian slave traders.

Inexplicably, her kidnapper picks up the phone. That's enough for Brian and his connections at the CIA to start the manhunt.

The second and third acts of ""Taken"" are, frankly, one mass killing after another, each unlikelier than the last. In the background, we see the pale, starving figures - some alive, some not - of other kidnapped girls. At one point, Bryan looks for his daughter in what appears to be a giant Port-A-Potty divided into tiny rooms by cloth curtains with a bed, a slave and a client in each. Bryan eventually finds the Albanians' home base, which is a hive of, well, drugged-out women and presumed venereal disease.

The movie is structured almost like a video game, with a number of bosses to kill and levels to complete. Brian's most daunting challenges lie in the bowels of a Paris brownstone at a million-dollar auction and aboard a ship headed for the Middle East. Whether Maggie is there, and whether he saves her, I'll let the film reveal.

Let it be said that Maggie Grace, a veteran of the ""Lost"" TV series, was 25 years old when she filmed the movie. She's lost any useful clue on how to play an innocent 17-year-old, and thus turns in one of the more embarrassing performances of the year. There is a way to pout - Kim is required to do it in just about every scene - and a way not to, and it's a mark of Grace's inelegance that she never carves out an ounce of chemistry with Neeson, whose Bryan is risking more than his life, his moral compass and years in prison to save her.  And, unfortunately, she is also not cute, as a scene near the end so drastically points out. You'll know the one, and you'll be asking yourself, ""Her?""

Neeson slips nicely into the role once given to Harrison Ford. His Bryan is sharp and ruthless, and the movie's key ""find you/kill you"" monologue is delivered with menace and precision. You'll want to watch it twice. Janssen and Berkeley have bit roles, as does the excellent Leland Orser as one of Brian's CIA buddies.

A subplot involving a pop singer is so extraneous and unnecessary that I think it exists to be extraneous and unnecessary, as if to show the audience a modicum of 1980s decency. Everything in ""Taken"" - the Eurotrash baddies, the body count, the ""heart's on fire"" hero of steely resolve but pudding heart - feels stolen from 1986. In other words - good for a pizza night.",1244246400,5,3884,4.5997109826589595

5942450,5,B00ANT85VY,"If you are looking for a movie with a lot of action then look no further. Taken has it all...great storyline/plot, great cast, GREAT chase scenes, and A LOT of action.  The previews do NOT do the justice for the movie. There is a lot more action sequences than what is shown in the previews. I was really impressed that it has a lot of action but it had a great enough storyline to keep me interested and entertained. This movie is really believable and heartfelt because it is about a father's love for his daughter and he will do anything for his daughter. There are not that many movies out there anymore that makes the father out to be the HeRo like this movie does.

Short storyline: Former CIA Agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) daughter,Maggie, goes on a trip out of the country to Paris with her friend only to get kidnapped by a group of men who ""sells"" (traffics) them to the highest bidder. Mills has to use every skill that he knows to find out who these men are, find out where they live, and stop them before his daughter gets hurt. He doesn't let anything or anyone get in his way of finding his daughter.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good storyline and to anyone who likes a lot of action. There is killing in this movie but it is NOT the over the top gory kind which is another reason I liked it.",1244073600,,1329,4.265873015873016
5942451,5,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson is literally back with a vengence.  We've seen Liam in action before, notably so in Rob Roy, and even The Phantom Menace, but never at this level.

At 56 years old, Liam proves he has not lost any of his edge.  One of my favorite aspects of Taken is the realism.  Of course, take that word with a grain of salt as I am talking comparitively.  Compared to other actioners, Taken let's you believe what is happening could really happen.  It is not so over-stylized that, while fun to watch, is not believeable.  THis is due in large part to the coreography of the fights.  Coreographer Olivier Schneider relies heavily on the reality based and brutal martial art of Silat.  Silat is a no-nonsense martial art, with strikes that are meant to stop an attacker in his tracks, not to show off.

This film has been compared a lot to Bourne Identity.  Personally, I think Taken is better; for two reasons.  First, it has more heart, and based on the very serious matter of trafficking.  Second, the action scenes are not edited so quickly that you can't see what is happening.  With Bourne, the fights are edited so quickly that you get the FEEL of action, without actually seeing as much of the techniques.

As mentioned, I appreciate the awareness Taken brings to the very real problem of human trafficking, especially with young girls and the sex trade.  The film is great action with a great story, and made that much better by exposing an important social justice issue.  This is a movie anyone can love, not just action fans.",1244073600,,1535,4.584558823529412

5942455,5,B00ANT85VY,"Former CIA Agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has 96 hours to find his daughter who has been kidnapped and who may be forever lost.  His daughter, played by Maggie Grace (Lost seaons one and two) goes to Paris with her friend, all with Mills' reluctant permission.  Mills then goes into hyper drive working to find his daughter, reaping vengeance along the way.

Neeson is very strong and the mood of his intensity is set from the beginning.  He has friends who he was worked with in the past that give us a view of what he was like before he retired to be close to his daughter who lives with ex-wife (Janssen).  The movie helps us to appreciate Mills who after years of neglect, feels a need to be there for his kid.

The movie takes us to Los Angeles and to Paris.  There are some very interesting chase sequences, one in a construction site at night, interesting sensation for sure.  There are a few intense fights that are seemingly unrealistic, however, who cares, he is trying to save his daughter.

Each encounter with the bad guys gets more and more intense.  The movie crescendos at last with a fight scene on a yacht.  Better than any James Bond type of view, and very interesting indeed.  I think this could be a prequel with Mills and his friends doing their actual work.  I think it would make an interesting story line.

I got the Single Disc Extended edition.  Not sure what was added that the movie lacked in the theater.  This is a great movie as I watched it.  This disc was a little lacking in extras, that I would loved to have had to fill in some of the details of the whys and hows of the movie after the fact.

Liam Neeson is an extraordinary actor and he adds a little bit of coolness to an otherwise cliche repetition of the same old thing.

5942459,5,B00ANT85VY,"Let there be no mistake - Taken is a no-holds barred, balls-to-the-wall action film.  But it also has first rate acting and a gritty feel to it.  Liam Neeson is well cast as a former covert agent for the U.S. Government who has retired to spend more time with his seventeen year old daughter.  He is unhappy when his daughter decides to embark on a tour of Europe with just a female friend.  His fears are confirmed when the two girls are kidnapped as soon as they land in Paris by mobsters who turn their victims into prostitutes.

Neeson then goes on a one man ""Dirty Harry""-like rampage to track his daughter down.  There are also a few plot twists along the way that keep things interesting.  The only thing that I didn't care for was the fact that Neeson was cast as an American and so had to lose his Irish accent.  They could have had him play an ex-MI5 agent who had married and moved to the USA etc. to explain his accent.  Nevertheless, its still worthy of a 5-star rating.  Now if you'll excuse me, I am going to go buy the extended director's cut version.",1243814400,3,1067,4.316582914572864

On a movie like this, once you know the ending the reason I watch it again is to fill in some of the little bits that I might of missed.  Doing this on my iphone while waiting for the doctor or some other appointment is a great way to re-live the experience.

5942461,5,B00ANT85VY,"I'm not huge on the whole movie-review thing. Usually, because I can't come up with anything worth while to say for most of the movies today. But, in this case--with this movie--I have alot to say...

First off,(without spoiling the plot for those who haven't seen it)I want to commend the screenwriters--or novelist--for even thinking up this movie.  It was gutsy and bold--despite the PG-13 rating. Few screenwriters want to even express the truth that this film holds. The subject matter is a bit controversial, and few people would touch the idea w/ a 10 ft pole.

Secondly, I want to commend the talented actor Liam Neeson for portraying the character of Brian Mills so eloquently and with raw emotion. Have I ever seen a movie of yours that I didn't like? I think not. You bring the emotion from the screen direct to us...the viewers.

And finally, to the director and producers: Despite the slight--and I mean slight plot holes--you guys tied this movie together almost seamlessly. Full of action, emotion and adrenaline. This movie left me surprisingly impressed.

In short, I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 13--due to the violence and subject matter.

I think all young people should watch it--and I am a young person, so I can say it is an eye opener for me. It might provide a much needed wake up call to those unaware of the trafficking of American girls into slavery in foreign countries.

Buy this movie! Lol",1243728000,,1444,4.729083665338646
5942462,4,B00ANT85VY,"I usually enjoy movies like ""Taken""--violence with purpose and edge-of-your- seat action--but this time, I was too aware that I was watching a movie, not experiencing the story, and unable to suspend my disbelief. Bottom line: Although the story is plausible (a slaver underworld run by ""foreigners"" is rife in Paris), I couldn't get past the fact that this was a movie.

First, I appreciate that Liam Neesom had the opportunity to play this character. In an interview some years ago Denzel Washington explained his role in ""Virtuosity."" His son was a little embarrassed that HIS father had not performed in the role of an action figure, thus the film with Russell Crowe. I suspect Neesom had reasons, too, to step out of weighty roles into a vengeance seeker. And he is certainly allowed!

However, here are things that took away from my 5-star commitment:
1. I'm sorry but Neesom is too old to do all the physical things he did. The viewer should have been given some clue that Neesom was still physically fit, e.g. working out in a gym, playing handball, something. Showing him wax nostalgic on his sofa over emotionally losing his daughter through years of job-related neglect made me think the opposite: uh-oh, couch potato in early retirement. Also, the tricky camera shots usually in a darkened atmosphere made it easy for a body double to do the stunt work in those one man against many fights.

2. His daughter Kimmy was impossibly silly. I will leave it at that.

3. The mother allowing two teenage girls to track a rock group across Europe was impossibly silly. What was the woman thinking? What world does she live in? Oh yeah, the world of the rich and pampered. I congratulate Neesom's character for not saying, I told you so, at the end. Justifiably, he could have!

4. Where did that bag of fluids come from that he used on the poor girl he ""took"" out of slaving? I don't doubt that he has done that before (put in a drip), but how did he get it? Just one of those things he was carrying in his duffel bag? That seems really far-fetched.

5. And the girl!! What happened to her? Does he just leave her? Note: I just learned that the girl is left at a safe house. Thank goodness!

6. And the worst: When Neesom is finally caught and suspended from a pipe, how he escapes is really too much!

7. Somehow I find it difficult to believe that even a retired ""government worker"" could leave Paris without being detained. There were too many dead bodies after Neesom rampaged through Paris. We know he didn't leave Paris without seeing some doctor. His arm was bandaged when he stepped off the plane.

On the other hand, there are many believable points: totally devoting himself to salvaging his relationship with his daughter, saving the rock star and earning her undying gratitude, killing without remorse in the cause of rescuing his daughter, unflinching violent action when needed, forging ahead fearlessly. It's these kinds of things that make or break an action movie. Because of Liam Neesom's commanding presence and talent (not fully utilized in this movie), as well as the points listed in this paragraph, I DO recommend the film with a nod of acknowledgment to what I consider less than perfect components.

New point: Kimmy didn't know the nature of her father's work, making their alienation caused by long-term absences more real. On the way to the airport, he told her he was a ""preventer."" By movie's end she saw exactly what he did--up close and personal--and had a new appreciation for her dad. That alone is worth the ticket price!",1243728000,,3560,4.69983948635634

THIS is why we are protective of our kids.  Liam does an awesome job and this is the kind of dad I'd like to have.  One that would stop at nothing and never give up on trying to protect me/save me, etc.  I actually think I'll buy this one. It's worth keeping around.",1243641600,3,582,4.142857142857143
5942464,4,B00ANT85VY,"Critically Acclaimed writer/producer/director Luc Besson (""Taxi"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""La Femme Nikita"", ""The Transporter"" and many more action films) returned with an action-packed film which was released in France in early 2008 and released in the US in Jan. 2009.  Besson known for giving crew members opportunities, gave his cinematographer for ""The Transporter"", Pierre Morel his first major International film with ""Taken"".

Written by Besson along with writing partner Robert Mark Kamen (""Gladiator"", ""The Karate Kid 1-3', ""Taps"", ""Lethal Weapon 3' and many more), ""TAKEN"" would feature an all-star cast which includes Liam Neeson (""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""Batman Begins"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian), Famke Janssen (""X-Men"" films, ""The Wackness"", ""GoldenEye""), Olivier Rabourdin (""La cour des grands"", La face cachee"", ""La Clef) and Maggie Grace (""Lost"", ""The Fog"").  ""TAKEN"" which cost around $25 million to make, was financially successful as it grossed over $220 million worldwide.

""TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT"" is featured in an ""Unrated"" extended-cut version which includes two extra minutes over the theatrical feature (which is also included).  There is a two disc version which includes a digital copy file on the second disc.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""TAKEN"" is featured in Widescreen (aspect ration of 2:40:01) and where many films tend to show the beauty of France, Director Pierre Morel wanted to show the real France, which include the seedy areas where prostitution and European gangs are located.  So, you get the gritty side of France and overall, picture quality is pretty good.  Granted, this is on DVD but I can imagine that on Blu-ray, this film's transfer would be wonderful with the amount of detail, outdoor scenes and action scenes involved.

As for the audio, audio is featured in English 5.1 Dolby Digital  (Spanish and French audio tracks in Dolby Surround are included).  This film sports a lot of action scenes.  From a car chase, many gun and machine gun shots, a pop concert and crowds galore, this  film utilized all 5.1 channels.  I was very impressed that I can only imagine how much immersive the Blu-ray DTS-HD Master Audio would be. Overall, the DVD's audio is well done at Dolby Digital 5.1.  I also watched the film in French and was very impressed by the quality of the voice acting!  Well done!

Subtitles for ""TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT"" feature English, French and Spanish subtitles.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""TAKEN"" is a magnificent, action-packed film!  It was also interesting to have a action-based International thriller that is not centered around terrorism but a real life problem of human trafficking and kidnappings of young women forced to take part in prostitution and forced into a life of drug addiction.  ""TAKEN"" features a perfect blend of action that is not overdone but most importantly, a well-written storyline that complimented the action scenes.  Director Pierre Morel who is very experienced as a camera operator knows what kind of shots he wanted and Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen together again for another well-written action-packed thriller.

I also have to say that I was surprised when I first heard that Liam Neeson would be the action-star of this suspense/thriller.  Even listening to the audio commentary, the writer Robert Mark Kamen was surprised but realized that Liam Neeson is a tall and fit actor, and Director Pierre Morel felt Neeson was perfect for the job.  Granted, we have seen Neeson fight before in films like ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" but his performance as a Jack Bauer-style agent who will do whatever it takes to find his daughter was impressive.

Personally, I want to see more of Neeson as the character of Brian Mills.  I think there are a lot more storylines that this character can take part in and similar to a film like ""DIE HARD"", I really hope the planned sequel is just as action-packed as this first film.

I also enjoyed the performance of Maggie Grace.  Having enjoyed her performance in the first and second season of ""LOST"", I was surprised to see the popular blonde from the show as a brunette.  But Grace did a wonderful job in playing an older teenager who seemed quite reserved but most of all, hitting her emotional scenes effectively.

The special features were quite interesting, especially learning how Director Pierre Morel likes to be behind the camera while he directs but also hearing the enthusiasm by the people involved with the film and the audience in France.  Also, it was very touching to see Liam Neeson together with his wife, the late-Natasha Richardson and how loving the couple were and even having her share the same stage with him during the press photography with both Besson and Morel in France.

Overall, ""TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT"" is an action-packed film that takes you on one heck of a wild ride.  Well-done job for second time director Pierre Morel, beautiful cinematography by Michel Abramowicz, well-written screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen.

Also, wonderful performances by Liam Neeson and the rest of the cast.  But combined with a DVD featuring an immersive and aggressive soundtrack with well-done utilization of all speaker channels, ""TAKEN"" is an action thriller worth owning on DVD and having in your collection.  I'm guessing that the film is much more impressive on High Definition for Blu-ray, so if you have a Blu-ray player and want an excellent action film, ""TAKEN"" is title worth checking out.

In the likes of James Bond, Jason Bourne and even Jack Bauer, I definitely want to see more of Brian Mills!  ""TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT"" is highly recommended!",1243641600,,7399,5.041152263374485

No $500,000 price tags on those girls.  Liam Neeson is over the top in the action scenes, destroying everything he comes into contact with, all of a sudden is supposed to be French without speaking it, (he does try to speak Albanian - by the way, Albanians seem to be the last group you can be politically incorrect about) kills everyone he sees no matter how outmanned he is, even shoots someone's wife for no real reason -  it is a joke!  And at the end he comes home free and clear without any ramifications of the destruction he has left behind.  We laughed all the way through it.  At least 007 is supposed to be funny!

5942468,4,B00ANT85VY,"One of the most exciting and interesting movies to be released in the first-half of 2009, TAKEN is a thrilling movie about one father's journey to rescue his daughter from Eastern European kidnappers who intend to sell her as a sex slave to the highest bidder. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired CIA special ops man who has recently moved so that he can be closer to his teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) who is living with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and her wealthy stepfather (Xander Berkeley). Bryan loves his daughter deeply, but feels disconnected from her and because of the posh lifestyle she is currently living. He is concerned that she might be loosing her way. When Kim is presented with an opportunity to travel with a friend to Paris for the summer, Bryan is against the idea. His work with the CIA have taught him how dangerous it is for young women to be traveling alone across Europe. Besides that, Kim is underage and her protective mother and stepfather have been overprotective and sheltered her from any knowledge of the real dangers of the world. However, after being reassured of Kim and her traveling companion, Amanda's (Katie Cassidy), supervision by a family in Paris, that there would not be any globe-trotting alone, and Kim's promise that she would call her father every day, he consents to let her go. It is only later that he learns the girls aren't going for any sort of educational reason, but to be a band groupie following a particular group on their European tour. Bryan is furious, but is still trying to reconnect and against his better judgment allows her to go.

Upon arriving in Paris, Amanda & Kim are met by a handsome, young Frenchmen who invites them to a party later that night and rides with them to the place where they will be staying. Kim is a bit unsettled by the many, but Amanda is smitten with lust. Upon arriving at the residence Kim is shocked to discover that Amanda wasn't being completely honest with her either because the family they are to stay with are gone for most of the summer and the girls will be left on their own. Shortly after, while talking to her father on the phone, Kim watches Amanda being abducted and sees the men coming for her. It turns out the man at the airport was the frontman for a group of individuals who make a fortune from kidnapping young foreign women, addicting them to drugs, and then selling them as sex slaves. Bryan tells Kim what to do and she obeys his every command right up until the point she is taken herself. Knowing that he has right around 48 hours to find his daughter before she is lost from him forever, Bryan begins calling in some favors and takes a personal jet of his wife's husband to Paris and begins looking for his daughter and hunting down the criminals who have taken her.

TAKEN is an action-packed movie that doesn't really stop once it starts. The first 15 minutes or so of the film are expositional in nature to introduce the audience to the characters, but from the moment that the kidnappers break into the Paris home until almost the very end of the picture, the movie is non-stop action. Liam Neeson is a wonderful actor and I have yet to see him give a bad performance.

Besides just being a good action movie, TAKEN also examines some subject matter that most Americans are unaware but should become more familiar. There are some coincidences in the movie used for dramatic purposes, but the portrayal of how the women in the movie are abused and victimized isn't just startling, but is also quite accurate. The kidnapping and selling of women as sex slaves is something that does happen and in some parts of the world has almost become common.

Overall, I found TAKEN to be a very good movie. There are certain parts of the plot that are predictable, but the movie is action packed and makes for an afternoon or evening of enjoyable viewing. It's also a movie that any parent with a daughter should watch.

The two-disc version of the movie includes both cuts of the movie (PG-13 & Unrated versisons), two commentary tracks, a making of featurette ""Le Making Of"", a video of the movie's premier entitled ""Avant Premiere"", a featurette that illustrates how some of the action scenes were made, and some trailers.",1243555200,,4249,4.615079365079365
5942469,5,B00ANT85VY,"Wow, I was really surprised by this movie.  I was tired of Liam Neeson because of his roles in Star Wars and Batman Begins - he just didn't pull them off to me. Moreover, I wasn't really interested in seeing another save the kidnapped girl or daughter movie, until I read a few reviews of this blu-ray disc. I was looking for some more good blu-ray discs and so I checked this out. After watching the first half of this movie, I immediately thought of Seagal's Out of Reach 2004 DVD and Man on Fire 2004. Similar plots, but Liam actually out performed Seagal.  Liam's acting was intense and very convincing and he was taking people apart just like Jason Statham in Transporter, etc.  There were also hints of Jet Li's Kiss of the Dragon (find the kidnapped girl in France while breaking a lot of bones). His personality was more like Denzel in Man on Fire - relentless get the bad guys at all costs.  He comes up with these implausible ways of figuring things out, but it is very satistfying to watch.  Also, reminds me of the revenge scenarios in Bronson's Death Wish.  I have cited a lot of good movies here - most of which you may not have seen - however, if you check out Out of Reach, I think you will see that Taken is far more intense and well acted and more on a par, but even surpassing Man on Fire in many ways.  Anyhow, revenge is a dish best served cold (Kahn) and this movie shows that even this worn out plot can be redone effectively and this director did a fantastic job of doing it and Neeson was unbelievable - a perfect mix of Seagal and Statham - and on blu-ray the picture was fabulous - I loved it!",1243555200,,1620,4.257328990228013
5942470,5,B00ANT85VY,"""Taken"" is one of those movies for your personal library. Liam Neeson does a convincing job of demonstrating the virility and vitality of the aging Baby Boomer. He's what Jason Bourne grows up to be.  Neeson's character doesn't knock you over with quick quips and a bevy of beauties.  He's merely a dedicated former government agent who has learned some ""tricks"" of the trade.  The screenwriter did an excellent job of creating a ""He-man"" without becoming a clich'. By Neeson recovering his daughter where his ex-wife's new rich husband isn't able to rise to the occasion, says the man who can really protect his family with sheer prowess is the better man. How could the ex-wife go back to a normal life when the real man (Neeson) lives across town? Of course, all this is subtle subtext.

The salient point is that Neeson is amoral, doing what is appropriate for the situation to affect an ideal outcome.  Neeson does the unthinkable in ways that are believable. No extraordinary special effects, no superhuman feats only possible for a man 20 years younger. In short, just plain old ""Americana."" Man encounters challenge. Man meets challenge head-on. Man triumphs!

I highly recommend ""Taken"". Neeson exhibits the subtle charisma of a Harrison Ford.

If you thought that Liam was bad (and by bad I mean gooood) as Ra's al Ghul in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Begins/dp/B000PC6A3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Begins</a>, wait 'til you see him as an ex-spy whose daughter is abducted while visiting Paris. Unfortunately for the abductors, Neeson was trained to ""prevent bad things from happening."" So when you combine a loving, overprotective father whose daughter has been abducted with a ruthless cold-blooded ""preventer of bad things from happening,"" you'd better not be in his way.

While some of the scenarios in Taken go a little over the top, the action is thrilling to watch, and Neeson is flawless in his role. I don't mean this to be a Neeson love-fest, but the fact is that the movie is 90% Neeson; he's on-screen in at least 90% of the scenes. It is indeed Neeson that takes Taken from being an average movie to being a really good movie.

You won't fall asleep watching Taken. Surprisingly the movie is PG-13; even the Unrated Extended Cut doesn't cross the PG-13 line (as far as I remember anyway). There's lots of action. Good acting.

Shooting an innocent woman in the arm to make her husband talk does not make me admire the so-called hero in the story, and neither does his leaving a man to be electrocuted repeatedly until the power eventually goes off.  Yes, I get that he is trying to rescue his daughter, but if it were so easy, there wouldn't be so many women still hidden away, as they are right now.

But I was trying to reconcile how Americans can love a movie like this so much (where a former CIA operative beats with extreme prejudice, tortures with extreme prejudice and kills with extreme prejudice) and yet turn all kinds of squeamish and hand-wringing when it comes to dealing with real-life terrorists really trying to kill us.

Does it have to be your daughter before you care?  Would you trust Liam Neeson to do the waterboarding?  Is it easy to ""pretend"" to like this stuff in a world where it isn't ""pretend""?

Just something I wondered after listening to friends after the movie.

5942482,5,B00ANT85VY,"TAKEN is a movie only marginally enjoyed by critics (57% at Rotten Tomatoes) but loved by the American public. Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, a retired government employee who has moved to California to be closer to his daughter Kim, played by Lost's Maggie Grace. Bryan is hesitant when Kim says she is going on a trip to Europe with her friends, but agrees to let her go if she promises to call. Kim does call from Paris, and while she does, Kim witnesses her friend Amanda being kidnapped. Suddenly, Bryan isn't retired anymore. He goes into ""government employee mode"" and tells Kim that she is going to be kidnapped and that he will come and save her.

While working for the government, Bryan was a ""preventer."" He prevented bad things from happening. You get a picture of what those skills were when he begans encountering and dispatching with thugs easily in France. The action is fast paced and brutal, but not overly gory since this is a PG-13 movie.

Bryan's CIA friends tell him he only has 96 hours to save his daughter. Neeson effortly displays the passion and desperation of a father about to lose his daughter. The villians are solid, and Maggie Grace is good as Kim.

I enjoyed this movie and believe it did so well at the theaters because it is about a father saving his daughter. It is about good versus evil. There is no gray area, if you are bad, you are killed by Bryan Mills, angry father and killing machine. There's no message in the film about the environment or terrorism or anything else that many big movies try to slip in to appease the critics. It's a simple movie where you know right away that all the bad guys deserve to die and you'll feel good when they do.",1242950400,2,1694,4.475728155339806

5942484,1,B00ANT85VY,"This film has more holes than my Kuru-riddled brain.

Treating a pernicious industry like the sex-slave-trade in a comic-book fashion is ludicrous and irresponsible. I've lived in SE Asia, working not in but alongside crusaders fighting this sorry malignancy. I know...it's only a movie. It's only the well from which our culture draws its knowledge.

The good guy (Liam) has less dimension than a straight line: he is simply not believable and thus is never engaging. Liam is always liam, whether in kilts, Jedi rags, WWII garb, Les Mis stripes, or chaps. Abysmal, our movie icons.
Anyway, the bad guys are NEVER shown being brutally bad, thus there is little reptilian satisfaction in their roastings, plumbings and guttings. Being one of the largest money-making businesses in the world, all of its prime-movers and lick-spittles are not morons, surely.

The film allows the viewer to know only a spoiled, perfidious, reckless teen-aged daughter...so where's the emotional investment for her plight?
Her mother (bitter-bitchy-ignorant but beautiful and shapely) is ex to Prozac-Crack-Liam, trophy-wife to handsome, rich-as-Croesus indulgent step-sugar daddy? No stereotypes here. Briefcase full of valid passports, ID's in reflections, homicidal trucks, venal trusted friends, etc...all original themes.

The final rewards are delivered at the endings (2)...landing at LAX, without a warm and fuzzy welcome from Interpol and the FBI? A singing audition for the air-headed kid? Did she learn nothing? Obviously a product of our public schools.
Come on, Hollywood, work on your introductions and endings (and everything in between). For instance, how the hell did they get off the yacht (with the other girls...he can't hand them over to the authorities) and out of France, severely wounded, with the miscreants and the police hot on their spoor? There is a good story there. A great story. Getting back across the Pond and into the US without the daughter's passport could have been another challenge...well, all right, fictionalize THAT challenge. And finally, disappearing into the fabric of LA/USA/upper Chad with reasoned vigilance and disabling paranoia would have been a reasonable exit.

You may enjoy the ride until there is a synaptic snap somewhere higher than your mesencephalon. If not, mark your territory again, just in case your essence is growing faint. Rehydrate yourself with another brew.

Taken has a little too much grain through most of the movie with the worst scenes being low-light situations (especially right after the construction site scene: at this point it looks like the movie was projected onto a rough tweed backdrop). If the filmmakers did this for effect it was a bad move because it takes me right out of the movie and gets me thinking about stupid things like transfers...

He also produced and co-wrote the popular Transporter films so he certainly knows what audiences around the world want to see.

The film delivers exactly what it promises: an excellent and entertaining thrill ride with no frills. It is as single-minded as its protagonist's mission and plugs in exciting car chases, fight scenes and gun battles. And yet, you are still emotionally invested in Neeson's character - you care about what happens to him and his daughter. The result is a truly satisfying and engaging film.

You have the option of watching the theatrical version or the unrated cut.

There is an audio commentary by director Pierre Morel and cinematographers Michel Abramowicz and Michel Julienne. They decided on two distinctive looks for the film: sunny and vibrant colours for Los Angeles and a darker vibe for Paris. They talk about the differences between American and French film crews. They also praise Liam Neeson's ability to play a loving father and a deadly killing machine. They also talks about the challenges of working in a city like Paris.

Also included is a commentary by co-screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen. He mentioned that he's been writing for 30 years with 15 of them with Luc Besson. They met on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fifth-Element-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B0006GVJE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fifth Element (Ultimate Edition)</a>. He worked with the filmmaker on creating a production company in Europe writing ""low-impact action movies."" Kamen says that the premise of the film was based on a story Besson heard from a French cop. Kamen also talks about how he writes with Besson and praises his ""cinematic vision.""

""Le Making Of"" is fairly standard if not engaging press kit material with the main cast talking about their characters and the story with clips from the film. There is plenty of behind-the-scenes footage of some of the film's exciting action sequences being shot.

""Avant Premiere"" features footage of the film's world premiere in France with Neeson, Morel and Besson doing interviews on the red carpet. There is haunting footage of Neeson and his late wife Natasha Richardson who was also in attendance.

Finally, there is ""Inside Action: Side by Side Comparisons,"" which takes a look at six action sequences being filmed along with the finished product.",1242777600,2,3059,6.034562211981567

The action is just a bit too unrealistic.  We see Liam beating up five guys at once who are all half his age, but we never see him pause to catch his breath once.  I don't think he ever bleeds or bruises at any time.  This is a shame, because seeing Liam's character at risk would have drawn the viewer deeper into the story.

5942490,5,B00ANT85VY,"This is a review for the 2 disc version:
Taken blew me away. It's a tight, well written action flick. Luc Besson wrote and produced this and the character building of Bryan (Neeson) reminds me a lot of ""The Cleaner"" in Leon: The Professional, which was an earlier work of Besson's. The action reminds me of the Bourne series but more satisfying in a way than Bourne. The first 30 minutes is awkward. But a lot of what Besson writes is awkward, but charmingly awkward. The extended cut is the European cut. They decided the American audience couldn't handle some of the scenes. There is NO nudity in this film at all and none in the extended cut.

But what you get on the 2-disc version and not on the 1-disc is the following:
""The Making of 'Taken'"" (18:22) - a featurette of the making of.
""Avant Premiere"" (4:37) - video of the premier night in Paris
""Inside Action: Side by Side Comparisons"" (11:05) - what it says
Plus, two tracks of commentary.
The second disc is nothing but the digital copy which is extremely annoying.

Is the 2-disc worth it? If you are a hardcore fan of Taken, then yes. If not, then buy the 1-disc cause that also has the extended cut. Buying the 2-disc is worth it for the commentary and 18 minute featurette.

Cons:
For me, the let down was the acting by Maggie Grace, but I'm not sure it's her fault. She is in real life a 25 year old woman and here she is unconvincingly playing a 17 year old teenager. I'm not saying she's a bad actor...she just doesn't pull off the age thing right. Her portrayal doesn't kill the film, and at times she nails it but at others it's just weird. They should have gotten an actress closer to 17 in real life. Even the ending was not realistic but I'm not sure it was Grace's fault. But at the same time she only endured the ordeal for less than 96 hours so I guess she might not be as traumatized as one would think she should be.

The film moves so rapidly, with the skills of cinematographer Michel Abramowicz, that the various other characters who populate this drama scarcely have time to establish an identity (Famke Janssen, Radivoje Bukvic, Maggie Grace et al).  The violence is constant but due to Bryan Mills' skills each death is so rapid that the camera doesn't linger  There are scenes in the brothels where the drug induced young girls serve as prostitutes that are quite disturbing, but again the camera doesn't pause long enough to make them gruesome.

This is a fine performance by Liam Neeson who demonstrates a mastery of the action roles that likely will lead to others in a similar vein.  It is a wild ride, but a very fine one.  Grady Harp, May 09",1242518400,2,1508,4.758620689655173
5942495,5,B00ANT85VY,"I had my doubts like most other reviewers here upon watching this movie. However after i had watched this movie it was clear, the movie had exceeded all of my expectations. A fantastic top notch thriller.

Liam Neeson play Bryan Mills a retired CIA agent who knows how to punch. He must call upon his past skills in order to save his daughter who has been kidnapped during a holiday in France by people traffickers. This is one of those things that is unfortunately very real and does happen.

Here you see Liam Neeson in one of his finest forms yet (however he has aged considerably). The supporting cast is good, and includes Famke Janssen as Neeson's ex-wife and features a good lengthy back story which helps develop Nesson's character. This international thriller is a very dark gritty masterpiece featuring some of the coolest close combat fighting which is up there with the Bourne triology and backed up by some top notch camera work making this a very fast paced movie that is entertaining and well worth your money. Neeson does a great job at holding this movie together with his gravitas and emotional availability that make his character the usual action fantasy of impossible competence and righteous fury. An extremely entertaining thriller from the legendary writer/producer Luc Besson.",1242432000,8,1301,4.936073059360731
5942496,1,B00ANT85VY,"Thanks to a torrent of derivative divorced-but-still-relevant-dad nonsense, (he gifts his princess the karaoke machine, the step-dad answers with a thoroughbred) plus an imaging trick first imagined in ""Blow-Up"" -- with a later techno-twist in ""Bladerunner"" -- some thinly imitated Bourne-Trilogy action sequences all triple-cherry topped by an incredibly tone-deaf (considering Bush-era policy) instance of torture, ""Taken"" should simply be given back. And because all that Liam's improbable rescue manages to accomplish is to assure the music industry the possibility of yet another teeny bop pop singer, after a 6,000 mile-long bloody trail we the audience aren't even rewarded with a happy ending.

Neeson is a fine actor, his presence being the only draw here. But the writer and director have him behave like Lancelot at the Wedding (Grail, The Holy), leaving a wake of mutilation and death that easily outweighs the main character's more ennobling purpose. It's a shame Neeson has chosen to add his name to the canon of these mindless revenge films that posture in reality while constantly resorting to fantasy in order to advance the action (after all, there is no extant plot to advance).

For a much more penetrating view of this particular form of moral complexity, please consider watching Ron Howard's underrated ""The Missing"" (again: daughter kidnapped to be sold as a white slave, rescued by estranged [grand]father and his daughter, her mother)  or ""Shotgun Stories"" (sister murdered) instead, films which forgo reflexive fatalism -- unlike this clich and corrupting bit of fluff.",1242432000,17,1596,5.401606425702811
5942497,4,B00ANT85VY,"By now, everyone has seen the promos of this movie with Liam Neeson talking on the phone with his daughter's kidnapper. ""I will find you, and I will kill you,"" being Neeson's last words to the kidnapper before the kidnapper replies, ""Good luck.""
  From that point early on in the movie, the action begins and doesn't hardly let up on the gas until the very end. Neeson tracks the kidnappers to Paris on his quest to rescue his daughter using his 'training' as a preventer.
  Some have compared this movie to 'The Bourne Identity' but I don't think it quite gets there. That's the only reason why this movie doesn't recieve five stars from me. But definately worth the 96 minutes.",1242432000,,679,4.586776859504132

While the theme and concept are good, the reality of REALITY is just ignored and create success in each pivotal scene just absurd.  They're just not even remotely plausible.  Liam's character seems to be a combination of a Navy Seal, James Bond, Batman, and maybe a tinge of the six million dollar man who never misses a shot, escapes all harm . . . effortlessly and just ridiculously cannot be stopped by machine guns or anything else.  This makes me want to see a science fiction movie just so I can get a plausible story line.

Interesting!",1242345600,17,776,4.460992907801418
5942501,5,B00ANT85VY,"First of all, when one thinks of a big action star, they tend to have names like Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the such spring to mind.  Then there's the typically quiet and reserved, yet strong character that Liam Neeson plays in so many films. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)</a>)(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nell/dp/B00013RC84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nell</a>.)

Every once in a while, however, a story and script come along which gives the likes of the powerful gravitas Neeson brings to the screen which allows him to kick some serious BUTT.  ""TAKEN"" is such a film.

From the get go, we get a few things thrown at us about this great man, loving father.  He's meticulous, he adores his daughter (even though he and his wife split long ago and she now lives with his ex and her new multi-millionaire husband.)  We also learn soon that he has a very unique past wherein he's a retired spy.  And throughout the course of the film, we find out that he's a very WELL-trained former spy.

This movie is easily one of the types that normally last around 2 hours plus. One beautiful thing about this film is the fact that it doesn't go too deep into the characters backstory.  We don't know what the true reason was for the breakdown of the marriage, how did the ex-wife get with the millionaire? What group of spys did Bryan Mills (Neeson's character) work for, etc.

The point is, we as the audience don't HAVE to know all this stuff.  The movie is just there to let us enjoy the white knuckle ride we're about to strap ourselves in for.

Near the beginning of the action, Neeson's daughter, played brilliantly by Maggie Grace (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-Fifth-Season/dp/B0019LY5IM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost: The Complete Fifth Season</a>) tricks her father to letting her go overseas.  He, being the concerned and wise father is quite leary about what she's up to and her safety (any parent.)  As it turns out, shortly after her and her friend land in Paris for a visit, they are kidnapped while she's talking to him on the phone. (By the way, this information is in the trailer, so no real spoilers if you're concerned.)

From the moment the daughter (Kim) drops the phone and the kidnappers pick it up, the tension is sky high.  We all know Neeson is a force, a hurricane covering a typhooon with tornados embedded in his rage to find out who has taken his daughter.

Using his skills and knowhow, he travels overseas to find his daughter and the ones who took her (and her friend Amanda.)

Action packed is an understatement for this full throtle movie!  There's so much great about this flick, it may soon be in my top five favorites with the more viewings I give it.

The emotion seen in Neeson's eyes, the subtle nuances and grimaces that he flairs upon his face speak volumes about what is going on inside his head, how the cogs of his brain are working non stop on plans A, B, C, D and beyond for his next steps.  Nothing, and I mean NOTHING will stand in his way to getting his daughter back.

The cast, as I said, is brilliant.  The script may have had a plot hole or two.  But more or less it's the type(s) which make you just shrug it off and say: ""Ack! it's just a movie!"" (the ACK is very important when making the aforementioned statement.)

To enhance the nailbiting action, the use of violin music (or maybe cello) really gets the heart pumping, the legs jumping and the fists clenching.

Then, on to the editing and sound.  Usually these are two categories which get overlooked by the general public.  However, in ""TAKEN,"" it's quite important and quite frankly very hard to miss.  Those punches, thos chops to the neck, the grueling torture is nothing short of awesome.

Needless to say, I loved this movie.  If you like action without a terrible amount of bloodshed (I watched the unrated version so I'm sure there was more in that version) and if you like a non-stop thrill ride that only lasts roughly 90 minutes, then ""TAKEN"" is certainly the movie for you.

Check it out indeed!

Watch, and enjoy!

5942502,5,B00ANT85VY,"They don't make good action flicks like they used to. Nowadays everything is CGI matrix style (which I have no problem with) but sometimes, a guy kickin' butts and busting heads is extremely refreshing. Neeson's performance is superb. Flawless. This guy is like a hybrid between Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer. The sound in the movie is also awesome. If you have a good Home Theater system (How someone can own a Blu-Ray player and a have bad Home Theater system is beyond me), put this movie in your Blu-Ray player, get some popcorn and blast away. Let the neighbors complain. Who cares. Liam Neeson stole the show on this one.",1242345600,4,625,4.63963963963964
5942503,5,B00ANT85VY,"When I was a soldier stationed in Germany in the 1970s there was a raid on a Turkish-owned bar on the outskirts of Frankfurt A/M. German Polizei and US CID (US Army Criminal Investigation Division) broke up a white slavery ring that had been operating out of the bar for some time. The bar was a way-point in the transportation route of young European girls (preferably blonde) who had been kidnapped throughout Europe and were being smuggled to be sold in the harems and brothels of the Middle and Far East. The police found some twenty girls in the basement of the bar, some from as far away as Denmark and the Netherlands, waiting to be shipped further down the pipeline.

The German police and Interpol had been watching the bar for some time and were hoping to trace the route farther down the track to take down the ringleaders. The white slavers made the mistake of kidnapping the daughter of a US Army colonel whom they thought was a German national. The Colonel learned about the investigation and refused to allow his daughter to be held by the white slavers and victimized so the police could gather intelligence. As it turned out, I learned later, the raid eventually did lead to the disruption of this particular ring because the guys busted talked.

So, when I learned what this film was about I went in with a certain amount of understanding of the subject matter. Let me say here that this film hits the nail on the head in presenting its subject matter and the way young women are victimized by ruthless animals only out to make a buck. (SPOILER) The scenes where they show the young women being made into drug addicts to control them are particularly disturbing to me as I've seen the impact drugs had on young girls working as unlicensed street walkers in Germany (a nation that legalized prostitution to make it ""safe"").  As disturbing as the film was I am glad I watched it and if I had a daughter (I had all sons) I would make her watch this film when she reached an appropriate age in hopes it would make her more careful in how she behaved when I wasn't around to protect her. This is a film every parent should watch - it is a film every teenaged girl and boy should watch. It's sad, but things like what happens to the girls in this movie go on every day.

Having said that, the next question is, is the movie good?

Well, I've never seen Liam Neeson deliver a bad performance. Even if I didn't like the movie (and he's done a couple turkeys) he has always been superb. No exception here. Sadly, most of the negative comments about this film seem to be from people who don't like action movies. But Neeson elevates this even above the typical action movie. This is a story of family. When I watched Neeson's reaction to what happens to his daughter and his response I imagine it is what Natalie Holloway's daddy wishes he could have done, what every father of a child who has been abducted and brutalized wish they could do.

As a professional soldier and former martial arts instructor I find Neeson's action scenes are superbly executed and realistic. Don't look for a superhero leaping tall buildings with a single bound, but watch an expert, who may not be as young as he once was, doing what he knows best for a good cause. The fights are brutal, ruthless, and efficient, pros doing what they do. Even the violence is understated, brutal, but avoids the spectacular many audience have come to expect. What Neeson does is violent but considering the circumstances and motivation, necessary to save his girl. Great stuff.

The alleged coincidences do not strain or insult the intelligence overmuch, this is an action movie for folks who think.  Of course, if you thought ""The English Patient"" deserved the Best Picture Oscar you'll probably hate this film. Otherwise, it is a don't miss. Neeson brings to the revenge flick empathy and gravitas lacking in other such films.

As I watched the film I thought of that Army colonel fighting Interpol and the German police to save his daughter. I hope he was able to see this film, I think he'd approve.",1242345600,783,4076,4.572602739726028
5942504,5,B00ANT85VY,"SYNOPSIS
Former government operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) had given up his career as a so-called ""preventer"" to be close to his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Even though Bryan joins his former colleagues for side jobs to make ends meet, he spends most of his time to be a part of his daughter's life again. Soon, Bryan gets hit hard when Kim requests permission to go to Paris with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy). Knowing what dangers lie ahead in a foreign country, he says no at first, but Kim's disappointment leads him to a reluctant yes. Soon after they land, Bryan's fears are soon realized when Kim and her friend get abducted by unknown assailants from their apartment - in broad daylight. Before getting dragged away, she phones Bryan and starts leaving him clues. This begins the longest 96-hours of his life - a hunt that will take him to the deepest, darkest corners of Paris and face unbelievable nightmares worse than he experienced in black ops. And Bryan will make sure that no one will stop him from saving his daughter.

MOVIE
What can I say? This is one hell of a roller coaster ride from beginning to end! This is Liam Neeson at his best! Taken delivers on the action, drama and suspense it promises. There is never a dull moment! My favorite part of the movie was when his daughter gets abducted, the assailant picks up her phone and Liam tells him:

""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.""

This will easily be one of the most memorable movie quotes for many years to come. Phenomenal movie!

PICTURE QUALITY
Other than some grainy shots in a few scenes, the PQ is perfect. Nice, sharp gritty picture.

AUDIO QUALITY
Whoa mama! Fox sure knows what to give its customers - a reference quality audio experience that can deliver. This can easily be used for a demo display to showcase the power of high definition surround sound. Remarkable and flawless!

5942509,5,B00ANT85VY,"The plot centers around an American agent who formerly worked for the US government in the Middle East and other foreign locations. His daughter is kidnapped by thugs from Eastern Bloc countries e.g. Albania in a reference to those who control much of modern sex trafficking. The 17 year old daughter and her friend are kidnapped and drugged along with many other young women and sold to rich men, particularly in the Middle East, another reference to reality of the sex trade as it exists today. The film also shows the complicity of some Western government functionaries who supplement their income by aiding and abetting these crimes.
The central character,played by Neesom, then uses all his skills to locate and rescue his daughter.
The movie is riveting from the first frame and Neesom depicts grim and resolute desperation in a way that can be understood by anyone who has ever asked themselves how far they would go to save a loved one.
This is a movie which should be seen by every American as it reflects the ugly realities of the modern world unburdened by political correctness. TAKEN is quite simply a terrific movie!",1242259200,2,1130,4.829896907216495
5942510,2,B00ANT85VY,"It appears that several dozens of people liked TAKEN despite its many plot holes (several of which are listed in the professional review on the first page of this marketing site). This film does have much that would appeal to teenage boys: lots of fast-cut action with flying fists and bullets, plenty of ""foreign"" villains who get wiped off the face of the earth by an American good guy with a righteous cause, and miles and miles of car chases! And, for middle-aged women, it has LIAM NEESON--towering over other men, emoting, flexing his middle-aged muscles, and saying all sorts of heart-fluttering semi-off-color things.

There are many other heroic-fantasy films which are just as good when it comes to fast, violent action: the BOURNE trilogy, the TRANSPORTER series, and HITMAN with Timothy Olyphant come to mind. If a person, for whatever reason, prefers to see fast action mixed with an erotic component, then HITMAN is superior to TAKEN and these others.

In this film,  Famke Janssen, as Neeson's character's ex-wife, is physically quite good looking (but unattractively bitchy most of the time). On the plus side, when it comes to screen presence, Liam Neeson still has it, and his delivery of the few witty lines of the script is effective.",1242259200,,1254,4.961904761904762

5942512,1,B00ANT85VY,"In my personal opinion, I don't think Liam Neeson is cut out for James Bond type of action thrillers. Even though he pulls it off, he is too intelligent of an actor and the roles he has played in his other films have had more depth and substance to them. The story of the film is interesting and reminded me of Mel Gibson's Ransom which is similar in that both actors play fathers whose child is kidnapped. There were multiple ethnic groups represented as the ""bad guys"" and I didn't get a sense of how they were all connected to each other. The film moves very quickly without much continuity between the scenes unfortunately. I like Liam Neeson as an actor. I did not like this film.",1242172800,3,685,4.4015748031496065

Besides, I always like to see the bad guy get his due. One of the most memorable parts of the movie was his line about having special skills, I will find you, and I will kill you. I thought Liam did a good job portraying his character. It had a good ending as well and that's always cool, for me at least. I and my wife sat there watching the movie and just went for the ride it took us on. In all, I just plain liked the movie.",1242172800,15,567,3.896551724137931

5942515,5,B00ANT85VY,"This is one of those great action movies where the hero isn't burdened by doubt, ineptitude, or guilt.  He knows what he has to do and he does it coolly and ruthlessly!  What he does is kill bad guys...  Lots and lots of bad guys of all nationalities, races, and creeds who deserve what they get.  Very efficient and ecumenical...

I lost count, but Liam Neeson must have killed about 50 bad guys in this one.  And they keep on spawning so he has more to kill.  I haven't seen one hero take on so many bad guys who keep on reproducing since Steven Segal made ""Hard to Kill""...

The action is non-stop and the retribution is very satisfying.  There is a lot of violence, but this is not an explicit blood and gore film.  Just good old Hollywood movie violence that hits you at the gut level.  ""Taken"" is a nice vicarious vigilante thrill for all the rest of us who must play by the rules.  Liam Neeson does an excellent job!  Highly recommended for action fans...",1242172800,203,962,4.337078651685394

I liked everything about this movie.  Most of the time I'm frustrated by martial arts movies that seem so choreographed that the heroes never get knocked down or injured during a fight.  I hope that Liam does another movie of this type maybe a sequel or even a prequel to this movie would be great.,1242172800,7,475,4.541176470588235

5942518,4,B00ANT85VY,"""Taken"" is one of those action thrillers with a main character who is or was a double-dog secret government wreaker of mayhem.  Written by Luc Besson, who also made ""Leon: The Professional"", ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""The Transporter,"" you go into this film expecting that there will be several scenes featuring our hero single-handedly taking on a room full of bad guys and, as my Granny used to say, whuppin' the tar out of them.  Actually - he does more than whup most of them.  Most wind up looking pretty dead, although no one stops to check for a pulse once the bodies start piling up.

The distinguishing characteristic ""Taken"" has over its brethren is the star.  Instead of Jason Statham or The Rock (20 years ago it would have been Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme), ""Taken"" stars lauded Irishman Liam Neeson.  The guy who played Schindler brings a degree of gravitas to a role not yet earned by most action stars.  There's a reason he provides the voice of Aslan in the Narnia films.

In this film he plays Bryan Mills, who spent most of his married life on the road doing secret C.I.A. stuff, and enjoying it, but neglected his wife and daughter.  As a consequence Lenore (played by Famke Janssen) is now his ex-wife, and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace from ""Lost"") lives with mom and new step-dad, a super-rich businessman.

Bryan regrets not being a better Dad and husband, so he has retired from the agency and moved near Kimmy, but when Kim lives in a mansion worthy of an NFL owner, it's tough for Bryan to compete for Kim's affection.

Kim is invited with a friend on a Paris vacation and Mom pressures Bryan to sign the necessary forms so that Kim can leave the country.  After years of dealing with the world's shady characters, Bryan is reluctant, but signs the forms after giving Kim a few rules - mainly to stay in touch with an international cell phone Bryan gives her.

Kim is in her opulent Paris digs for all of about an hour before Albanian drug and prostitute slave traders break into the apartment.  Dad is on the phone chastising Kim as the bad guys break in, and Bryan is able to piece together a few pieces of information when he tells Kim to give him as much description as she can before she is kidnapped.

The rest of the movie consists of Bryan tearing apart Paris, one room of bad guys at a time.  At least four times he strolls casually into a situation surrounded by four or more baddies, and after the first few times the Mrs. and I would turn to each other and predict ""I think THOSE guys are about to have a BAD day"" each subsequent time he encountered more eurotrashy guys.

At an hour and a half, Besson and director Pierre Morel keep the pace at a level that barely gives you time to catch your breath.  It's entertaining in a Bourne kind of way, and it makes me feel better seeing a man ten years my senior able to whup the tar out of a hundred bad guys.",1242172800,2,2898,4.415413533834586

5942521,1,B00ANT85VY,"THE MOVIE:
Watch Man On Fire or The Brave One instead. This is a sad, sad attempt to capitalize on the revenge movie genre. At no point can this movie ever be taken seriously. The dialogue is laughably convenient with the subtlety of a sledge hammer. Neeson's character is comically professional at what he does; remaining perfectly stone-faced and professional as his daughter is abducted and kidnapped. His character is beyond ridiculous and everything he says or does is utterly hilarious.

The beginning of the movie is exceptionally artificial and transparent because every scene is so clearly an excuse to bluntly tell you something about his character. NONE of it feels natural, which is okay on a certain level but the movie tries to take itself seriously and that's where it all falls apart.

The acting is pretty bad overall, despite many of the actors being very good in other movies. This is a sign of bad directing and bad editing. This is likely because the director's previous movie was District B-13; an enjoyable action movie that is very short and in which 2/3 of movie is action. The problem comes when this director tries to make an action movie with drama and everything falls apart.

The most important ingredient to a revenge movie is motivation and the movie just has none. Despite its many attempts to establish characters, I never felt anything for anyone, least of all the daughter. The only thing we have to go on is that they tell us the girl's his daughter and some nights he sits looking at childhood photos of her. There's no reason to care about her, especially when she blows off her father's heartfelt gift because her rich stepdaddy bought her a pony. That's right, a pony. Could it get anymore cliche?

Seeing a shallow, 60-year-old man brutally beat up and shoot countless people, only made worse by the juvenile directing and editing, was the source of immense hilarity to my friends and I. I don't know why Neeson doesn't turn and wink at the camera spouting off lines like ""[I'd sacrifice everything for her]"", ""[I'll tear down the Eifel Tower if I have to"", and ""[I could follow you across Europe. I'm very good at not being seen]."" Neeson's attempt at the [Batman voice] was also hilarious; ""WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER!"" He's way above this material but even his acting is crap.

There's 0 drama in this despite the constant attempts to force it down your throat. In my mind, I cannot imagine anyone taking this movie seriously. It really is an unintentional parody of the highest calibur right up there with Wanted. I also can't believe this movie was written by Luc Besson. He has made excellent action films like Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element, and Unleashed. It seems like a 12-year-old wrote this. Then again, he was involved in the Transporter movies and those are meh but at least they DON'T TAKE THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY.

Also, pretty much every time someone dies in the movie it's so poorly handled that it's to the point of parody. The shots he uses and the context of many of these are hilarious. Like a truck coming out of nowhere and running over someone, or showing a guy look through a port hole only to have Neeson pop into frame quickly and shoot the guy in the face through the port hole. Or the part that takes the cake is when Neeson quickly stands up and shoots an innocent woman in the arm... FOR NO REASON! Maybe in another context many of these things could have felt more natural, shocking, or interesting but it's all so hilarious here. I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater because I would have likely been kicked out for laughing so hard.

It's a terrible movie overall, but an excellent choice for a comedy rental but no one should ever own this trash.

5942527,4,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson as ""Bryan Mills,"" reminded me of Denzel Washington's role in ""Man On Fire.""

5942533,5,B00ANT85VY,"This title won me over with one of the best guilty pleasures I have encountered on a Blu - and it was an awesome film.

I have read a plethora of reviews covering the story, and honestly it is simple enough in that of a dad looking to rescue his kidnapped daughter. The quality of the Blu had loads of opportunity to fail with all of the close quarter hand to hand and nighttime action, but they did quite well. There is some hints of grain here and there but it seemed relevant to the scene. Otherwise - a nice transfer. The DTS was superb and bolstered Liam's resounding voice properly. The outer channels did not get used as much as I had hoped, but fortunately they did not score this film where voices and action get drowned out.

Now for the fun stuff. I watched the extended version (1:33:25 vs. 1:30:55 on the rated) and turned on the Black Ops option. Two things occur here: 1. A semi-decent trivia track that provides some relevant facts regarding human trafficking and 2. A body count meter, time remaining watch (the 96 hour window) and a miles traveled listing. I loved it. This option finally answered those nagging questions (in an action movie like this) of did that bad guy really die or not, or is he coming back to wreak havoc. For instance, when a car crashes did it really kill every bad guy in the back seat or are they coming back in the next scene - killed meter clicks up 2 spots - answer is no. Spoiler: final count 33 dead, 13 wounded, 12K miles traveled in exactly 96 hours. The only drawback is it removed the subtitles to play the tracks, so you lose all of the French conversation translations. Most of the rated/unrated version differences are towards the latter half of the film (violent half) as at 41 minutes there was only a nine second variance.

2 of the commentary tracks are exclusive to the unrated, the side by side documentary provides comparison on the actual shooting stock to the final film cut, a 20 minute making-of provides some nice insight, but then I was hit with a rare emotional moment on a BD supplement. There was a nice film premiere documentary with interviews of cast and crew on the carpet, but most noticeably some very touching footage of Natasha and Liam. Some brief but genuine moments that speak for themselves.

Sure, it's cliched, and sure, almost all of the stunts here are theoretically impossible, but the amazing thing is that you never really care.  Liam Neeson's quest to save his daughter from the world of sex slave trafficking is a rollicking ride, fueled by Neeson's acting chops (finally, an action hero who uses his brain as much as his fists, and not to mention some silver-tongued threats) and director Pierre Morel's sense of style.  (Let's also not forget writer/producer Luc Besson, who's brought us such contemporary action classics as ""The 5th Element"" and the genuinely awe-inspiring ""Leon, The Professional"").  TAKEN isn't necessarily an action movie with brains; it's more of an action movie where you don't care if it has brains or not.  It has gravitas (in the form of Neeson, and let's face it, that was probably one of the best and most surprising casting decisions of the past decade) and skill, and will leave you gasping for breath and cheering for a genuinely likable hero who has ""a certain set of skills"" and knows exactly how to put them to use.",1241222400,2,1439,4.864754098360656

5942540,4,B00ANT85VY,"""Taken"" combines elements of the James Bond films with the tale of a father's attempt to build a relationship with a daughter for whom he was never there in her younger years.  It is a fast-paced, exciting action thriller made with style and polish.  If analyzed too closely, its preposterous and coincidental events would strain any reasonable credibility.  But never mind.  ""Taken"" is a neat, roller-coaster ride of a flick.

 Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his CIA job and relocated in order to be closer to his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who lives a life of wealth and privilege with her mother (Famke Janssen) and stepfather (Xander Berkeley).  Bryan reluctantly gives his consent for Kim to spend the summer in Paris, on condition she call him every day.

At the Paris airport, Kim falls under the charms of a handsome young Frenchman who is actually part of a ring designed to kidnap young, foreign women for sale to Arab sheiks.  Kim is conveniently on the phone with Bryan when the kidnappers arrive.  Bryan immediately contacts his former friends in the CIA to piece together evidence he has culled from the brief phone call, which he had the foresight to record.

The balance of the movie follows Bryan as he attempts to track down Kim in Paris.  During his quest, we see that this quiet, soft-spoken man has an entirely different side; he is a highly trained field agent who knows his way around self-defense, weapons, bribery, interrogation, torture, and forgery.  Working mostly alone, he takes on a bevy of bad guys and scurrilous types as he follows the trail to his daughter, dispensing with a good deal of civility along the way.

""Taken"" is not a great film, but the kind that draws you in and holds tight for ninety minutes.  Director Pierre Morel has staged some exciting set pieces, a nifty car chase, and explosions, and tossed in a collection of surly thugs and rich, well-dressed villains to spice things up.  We root for Bryan because his use of violence is directed only against those who deserve it.  He is ruthless and doesn't subscribe to the unwritten cinema rule that the good guy must be fair, upright, law-abiding, and moral at every turn no matter how difficult the going gets.  Bryan has no compunctions against knocking off anyone who might have had any part in his daughter's abduction.

Neeson is an interesting choice for an action hero.  He looks more like a college professor, and that's the point.  When he springs into action, it is unexpected and his proficiency is startling.  He refers to his former occupation with the government as a ""preventer,"" but it soon becomes clear that his job involved more than polite roundtable diplomacy.  Like Jason Bourne, Bryan thinks in nanoseconds, sizing up his immediate surroundings, assessing the degree of danger he's up against, and determining his offense or defense.  We, the viewers, are often surprised by his swift, efficient moves.

Michel Abramowicz's photography enhances the film's action sequences and Frederic Thoraval's editing makes scenes shot piece by piece look seamless.  This is especially evident in fight scenes, which are abundant.

It's surprising that ""Taken"" is rated PG-13.  Its violence, sexual content, plot references to drug use, and strong language would seem to justify an R, but strange are the ways of the MPAA.",1240704000,24,3348,4.930357142857143

5942544,5,B00ANT85VY,"Released in the U.S. in January, 2009, ""Taken"" is one kick-axx movie! In fact, it's the best I've seen in a long time.

THE PLOT: Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent whose 17-year-old daughter is abducted by Albanian sex-slavers while vacationing in Paris. Neeson immediately flies to Paris and utilizes all his skills to find his daughter and mercilessly punish anyone involved in the sex-trade who gets in his way.

""Taken"" plays out like a James Bond flick but without the goofiness and boring parts. Once Neeson gets on the trail of the sex-slavers it's non-stop suspense and action until the end.

What makes the film work so well is that, like Neeson's character in the story, the viewer is left totally outraged by the sex-slaver's abduction of his daughter; hence, you're passionately rooting for him throughout the rest of the flick.

It's true that Neeson is a veritable one-man-army in the film but it's presented in such a way that the viewer is able to suspend disbelief. In other words, it SEEMS believable. More than that, you WANT it to be believable because you want him to get his daughter back and annihilate the scumbags. Besides, Neeson is realistically portrayed as a father ruthlessly driven and pulling no punches. He has the emotional edge and determination that the slavers lack. He's an unstoppable force pure and simple.

The film addresses a scary subject -- the sex-slave trade. This really happens. I know of two beautiful young girls locally who have disappeared while vacationing abroad; one was in Cancun and the other in Africa. The parents and siblings are left devastated and scarred for life. What happened to the girls? No one knows, but the sex-slave trade is a very real possibility. Not to mention the Natalee Holloway case; Urine Van der Sloot confessed in an interview that he sold Natalee for $10,000 and a boat came and picked her up. This would explain why no remains have been found. Although he later retracked the statements the strong possibility remains that Natalee may have been sold into the sex-slave trade.

The moral of ""Taken"" is simple: Anyone involved in the sex-slave trade deserves nothing but instant and merciless obliteration from this plane of existence.

Incidentally, I read Roger Ebert's review before seeing the film and he gave it a mediocre 2.5/4 Star rating. Nothing could be further from the truth. ""Taken"" pulls you in and and takes you on an enthralling thrill ride throughout its runtime. Not to mention it's well made on every level. But let's remember that Ebert gave the overrated and pretentious ""No Country for Old Men"" a perfect 4/4 rating. Unbelievable.

The film was shot on location in France and runs a short-but-sweet hour and a half.

5942546,5,B00ANT85VY,"Who would have ever thought that Hollywood would attempt to include an important topic to serve as the basis for one of its typically generic, yet entertaining action films? Generally these films are created to provide mindless escapism along with a hefty dose of guns and fist-fights, or just to be another brainless vehicle showcasing the action star of the moment. In the case of ""Taken"", a much more serious topic, the trafficking of women, serves as the catalyst for all the mayhem that ensues over the course of the film.

""Taken"" is the story of a young girl named Kim (Maggie Grace), who takes a trip to France with a friend for the summer; however, what should have been a trip filled with good times and fond memories, turns horribly wrong when they are kidnapped for the sole purpose of being sold into a dark underworld of sex and drugs. What the kidnappers didn't count on was that Kim's father, Bryan (Liam Neeson), is a man of rather ""special"" talents that he learned during his time spent working as a spy for the United States government. With his daughter's life in jeopardy, Bryan must call upon every deadly skill he's ever learned to track down those responsible and save his daughter before it's too late.

Filmmaker and writer Luc Besson (""Transporter"" series) has made a career out of delivering to audiences bone crushing, overly stylized and over-the-top action movies that entertain us, but don't really give us anything new in terms of story or emotional range. With ""Taken"" Luc Besson, along with co-writer Robert Mark Kamen (""Transporter 2""), imbues the story with a much more serious, emotionally charged backbone. The seedy underworld of kidnapping and trafficking women for sex is one that exists without a whole lot of attention being called to it, thus making this film's message all the more important. The story is wisely written in such a way that it gives us just enough of a glimpse into this world that we become more enlightened as too some of the new threats out there, but not so graphic that the film is too shocking for most people to see. By handling the subject matter in this somewhat delicate manner, some would say it just glossed over the evil done in this so-called ""business"", but the message is able to reach a much broader spectrum of people than a harder edged movie would have been able to. For those feeling that the film didn't do enough to expose the despicable nature of this world, I do agree, but I understand why it was a better decision not to go too far with it. Because to go too hard and gritty with this movie by being too explicit, you run the risk of limiting and/or alienating your audience, which is not something you want when dealing with such a serious topic.

Even with the much heftier subject matter, ""Taken"" still could have run the risk of being just a slightly above average action movie if not for the considerable talents of star Liam Neeson. Liam brings to the character of Bryan a gentleness and an obvious love for his daughter in the early portion of the movie, so that when the rubber really hits the road, the actions he takes to find her, and the ferocity in which he acts is completely believable. Regardless of how brutal Bryan may act towards these undeniably deserving adversaries, he never becomes inaccessible to the audience. This is because Liam's gravitas and at times emotional performance keeps the audience invested in his character and his mission. Sometimes in an action movie, the action can become too front and center that the how's and why's of the story (no matter how important and central they may be to the action) get forgotten about until the very end when they are conveniently re-introduced to the audience as a reminder. For ""Taken"" this is not the case, as Bryan's love for his daughter and unwillingness to give up on finding her always remains front and center, even during the action sequences.

Other members of the cast included Famke Janssen (""X-Men"" trilogy), Maggie Grace (""The Fog""), and Leland Orser (""The Bone Collector""). Each of these supporting actors and actresses do a good job with the little time they do receive onscreen. Primarily this movie belongs solely to Liam Neeson, while the supporting roles are nothing more than glorified cameos, which suits this type of film perfectly. Out of the supporting cast, Maggie Grace probably gives the best performance, because had it not been for her emotional connection with Liam in the film's early scenes, the audience wouldn't have been able to connect with him as much later on. Sure, the story would have still impacted us in some way, but by having their relationship feel so realistic, it made our connection to him throughout the remainder of the film all the more palpable.

Lastly, first time director Pierre Morel brings his keen eye for action to the proceedings with great effectiveness. Pierre's work as Director of Cinematography on the action film ""War"", starring Jet Li and Jason Statham, clearly served as great preparation for his work on this film. While I didn't enjoy the aforementioned film all that much, the action scenes were handled very well, much the same way as they are here. Unlike many of writer Luc Besson's action films, ""Taken"" contains none of his trademark over-the-top, overblown action sequences that while incredibly fun to watch, are completely unbelievable. Instead, Pierre opts to keep the action realistic and up-close and personal, while still providing plenty of hard-hitting, fast-paced (somewhat stylized) fight sequences, that don't really feel all that unbelievable or obviously choreographed.

""Taken"" is a great action film that offers plenty of violence for the action junkies, while at the same time providing some solid acting, and a story that shines a light on a dark world that needs to be exposed and put to an end.

""Taken"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.",1240185600,5,5927,4.8450148075024675
5942547,4,B00ANT85VY,"Perhaps it is the torturous and troubled times we live in. Perhaps it is because so many of us feel powerless so much of the time. Whatever the reason, it is hugely satisfying to watch Liam Neeson's cool and highly skilled ex-special operative take control of the horrifyingly dangerous situation his (extremely typical) teenage daughter puts herself in. The fact that she's traveling in Europe and far from her pampered American home sweet home, and the fact that he's a wounded divorced dad struggling to keep close connections with her, add exquisite pain and suspense to this taut thriller.

5942548,2,B00ANT85VY,"Taken made by the same French team that made the Transporter flicks. Clueless mother lets her daughter go on a trip to Europe with only another girl who just supposedly turned 18. They get kidnapped by an Albanian ring who specialize in white slavery, etc. Liam Neeson, the father, is an ex some kind of special op's for the government. In other words, he knows how to take care of business. He goes over to Paris and proceeds to become a one man Albanian butt kicking crew. I believe he kills or maims half the Albanians in Paris before he gets his daughter back! If you have ever seen Mystery Science Theater, with the robot making fun of the proceedings , then that was I watching this flick. Neeson does a great acting job keeping a straight face throughout. Lots of silly action and over the top fighting and graphic violence. Give it a 2 for the amusement factor.
  The glowing reviews for this film makes me believe that the criteria for the action genre has sunk to a new low. The plot is so obvious that a 7 year old can follow it. It is simplistic, banal, and utterly predictable. The film takes itself too seriously, and has little relation to the actual kidnapping problem in Europe. The film would have been more palatable if done tongue in cheek. Where is the nuance? The bad guys take incompetence to a new level, while the good guy performs at superhero level. I think that these types of movies appeal to the reptilian brain in all of us. We jettison all critical facilities because our deep emotional needs for order are met at a basic level.",1239926400,8,1560,4.470175438596491
5942549,4,B00ANT85VY,"I missed this flick in theaters but saw it last night on BD (UK ed). Fox presents an adequate transfer (unfortunately rather rare for the studio), but the DTS sound was a pleasure. It was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and Panasonic BD35 player. Given the extensive fighting, shooting, and other action scenes, I thoroughly enjoyed the DTS treatment. The picture was grainy in some dark shots, but overall very crisp.

Though some reviews across numerous sites have remarked that Liam Neeson was an odd cast for this highly physical film, I disagree. In order to take on an underground women prostitution smuggling ring, singlehandledly, a mature, seasoned and perfection-driven type would need to be cast. He portrayed the girl's father and his skillset in a convincing manner.

The pace of the film is very fast, and was a bit too fast for me, in rushing along the character development. The acting was a bit robotic in parts, especially of the daughter, who seemed overly excited and hysterical in normal scenes (not after she had been kidnapped, obviously). In parts it seemed like the director or actors ""tried too hard"" to create drama, and whether in the script, or the execution, it was a little ""over the top"". The story was over the top, of course, and quite dramatic, but the delivery seemed a bit overblown.

Still, I can see how this was dubbed one of the best action movies of the year, as the centerline story of a dad fighting for his daughter in a very dangerous situation is a very powerful concept for humanity. The story was relatable and fast paced. Highly recommended!",1239753600,2,1593,4.7644927536231885
5942550,5,B00ANT85VY,"Released overseas about half a year ago and widely acclaimed, Taken is the new action flick written by Luc Bession, who did the very famous Leon: The Professional. If you were satisfied with the pure straight Balls To The Wall action style that Leon offered, look no further than Taken, with Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace! Taken is an action movie that just is pure energy and action from beginning to end.

In ""Taken"", Liam Neeson plays Bryan, an ex-CIA agent who is divorced from his wife, yet still sees his Daughter on a regular basis. His latest thing he's done is protect a repressed pop singer from a violent riot that happens after a concert of hers. Later, he learns that his daughter wants to go to Europe with her friend, and he very reluctantly lets her. Within the very first hour of their arrival in Paris, they are both captured by two people, and Bryan, being the overprotective flake he is, learns that these two people addict the girls they capture to drugs, and eventually, within 96 hours, they become prostitutes in the European Sex Slave Trade. Bryan travels to Paris to save her. He has 96 hours to find her and get her to safety or it's too late!

More effective than an energy drink, this movie wastes no time and just gets straight to the point right away. There's lots of great action, and the finale on the boat is a total ""WHOA"" moment. The only problem I had with this film is that even though I loved it, I had the feeling as if I had seen it before somewhere. Usually, with these types of action films, you've seen one, you've seen it all.

Most of us would lack the skills and resources to pull off the heroics, but not the resolve.

Someone takes Bryan's (Neeson) little girl Kim (Grace), but doesn't realize he is a very dangerous man capable of some serious damage when provoked.  The rest of a movie is a chase to find Kim, where Bryan uses his vast array of skills acquired as a former FBI agent to track down the evil criminals involved in her abduction.

Before allowing Kim to go on vacation to Paris with a friend, Bryan insists on precaution.  He's hesitant in the first place, denying her initial request; however, he eventually relents but with a few requirements.  Kim gets a cell phone and must stay in constant contact with her father.  Off she goes to Europe away from daddy's protection.  Within a single day, but not too quickly, his daughter calls her father.  While on the phone she sees her friend get kidnapped, and her father lets her know she is also going to be taken.  Dad is not pleased, informs the bad guy as much, and the bad guy's reply, ""Good luck.""  The hunt is on.

Make no mistake about it, get in Bryan's way and you'll be punished.  If he has time, and you pose a particularly burdensome obstacle, you may even die.  For the most part he drops various bad guys with single head shots.  Other than Captain Kirk's infamous neck chop, there has not been such one-punch precision in the history of combat.  Every criminal element involved is essentially a punching bag, rag doll waiting for the coup de grace.

Will he get to his daughter in time?  The power of this movie is the suspense, not knowing if he'll make it in time to save Kim from danger, or if he'll find her at all.

This turns out to be a hit (it's already grossed $143 million thus far) thanks to the casting of Liam Neesom (Schindler's List; Rob Roy).  A physically imposing actor of great presence, Neesom brings this physicality to the role of an retired CIA man brought back into action when his daughter is kidnapped in Paris.

When his French counterpart asks him if he would go on tearing parts of Paris apart in the pursuit of these men he quickly replies that he would burn Paris to the ground to get his daughter back.  As the father of a beautiful daughter I can understand his rage as well as his reply.  That line resonated with me because I would paint all of Europe red with her captor's blood to get my little girl back.

5942556,4,B00ANT85VY,"The great thing about a movie like ""Taken"" is that it knows exactly what kind of movie it is.  There is no awkwardness, no ""message,"" no random and unfulfilling subplot--just a good set-up followed by a relentless pursuit.

Liam Neeson plays ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills, a haggard retiree who lives alone and wants only to have a good relationship with his semi-estranged daughter.  Bryan's buddies needle him about a life with nothing to do, and convince him to protect a famous singer for a one-time job--which allows for the obligatory ""you don't want to mess with this guy"" scene early in the movie.  He then very reluctantly allows his daughter to go to Paris, where she is kidnapped by a high-end prostitution ring.

That's the first act, and although it takes a little while to unfold, all the elements are necessary for an understanding of what happens later in the movie.  Once Bryan Mills is off and running, your eyes will never leave the screen.

Neeson is perfectly cast here, using his athletic, intimidating physique (he was once a boxer) to great effect in many confrontations.  ""Taken"" is a white-knuckle pursuit, and both the chases around Europe and the fight scenes recall the James Bond and Jason Bourne movies, and the rather underrated ""Ronin.""  In fact, it occurred to me while watching ""Taken"" that Neeson might have made a better Bond than Pierce Brosnan.  Neeson is a bit too old for it now, and Daniel Craig has shown himself more than capable as everyone's favorite spy.  But Neeson's brutal physicality, combined with his emotive physiognomy, makes Bryan Mills a character everyone roots for.

If you're looking for complex character development, Bryan Mills is no Oskar Schindler--but that's hardly the point of ""Taken.""  It's a quick and gratifying ninety-four minutes when you're looking for a well crafted, suspenseful thriller.",1238457600,4,1859,4.996753246753247

5942559,4,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson plays the lean hard guy surprisingly well in this efficient if brutal thriller.
He is divorced and has given up his career as a government agent of some description, to be near his 17 year old daughter, who lives with his ex-wife and her new rich husband.
When she is kidnapped on a trip to Paris, all his expertise kicks in to get her back.  And really, that is about it - in an era of sophisticated thrillers with labyrinthine plots, the narrative here seems very simple and told in straightforward linear fashion, with few if any surprises.
And yet, it works - because it is lean and fast - the action is brutal and frenetic in close up Bourne style, and once events kick off it really does not let up until the unsurprising conclusion.  Neeson is lithe and believable as a trained killing machine, giving the film a huge boost of credibility.
There is it has to be said a mean streak in Neeson's character at odds with the family man, as he mercilessly kills off any and everything that gets in his way.  In fact, it becomes almost unpleasant that the film is purporting an American has a right to do whatever he likes in Europe to protect `his own', including torture, on the spot assassinations, and untold collateral damage.

5942563,4,B00ANT85VY,"A lot have complained about the similarities with the Bourne franchise. A lot have said that it's your typical, superficial action flick. They're right.

Yet why does it work so well? Surely, if it was bad knockoff, people wouldn't be rating it 5 stars. It's the cast. They, led by the impeccable Liam Neeson, carry the movie. Neeson is charismatic and believable as Bryan Mills, former CIA operative who tries to make up for the years he was busy doing what he does best: being invisible. He's lived most of his live in the shadows and wants to know what it's like to walk in the sun.

At first, it seems to work out well. His 17 year old daughter, humble and kind despite the luxury her mother and her rich stepdad bathe her in, welcomes her father back into her life with open arms. Her mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) seems uneasy in his company, using every opportunity to jab at him. This seems like an attempt to convince herself she made the right choice rather than the character really disliking him.

All is well until daughter Kim tells Mills she wants to go to Paris with her best friend. This request seems innocent enough (I for one have visited Paris on my own when I was merely 16) but warning bells go off in his head. Maybe his life on the dark side got to him, or maybe it's that and a dose of concern for his only daughter. He says no, but after both Lenore and his daughter hounding on him, he grits his teeth and hands his daughter a whole list of places to stay out of.

She goes to Paris and what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime turns out like a visit to hell. She and her slutty friend Amanda don't seem to get along well at all and to make things worse, their sloppiness as a civilian got them kidnapped and sold into prostitution. Luckily daddy has some tricks on his sleeves and comes after her.

Where most good dads are like Teddybears, Neeson is a grizzly with some damn sharp claws. The tricks he uses are in the Bourne territory, but entertaining to watch nonetheless. The pacing is fast and what really helps the film is that Mills doesn't screw around. This guy pulls no punches. He doesn't tell his victims what will happen to them or why he does what he does. There's no fade to black or miraculous interference at the last moment. The scenes are thrown in your face and that's what makes this film work.

What I also liked is that Maggie Grace, (the 25-ish actress who plays Kim) really got into her role and made her character very believable even though she seems like your typical damsel in distress. She works with what she has and it adds to the movie.

The material might not be fresh but its executed so well that the flaws are forgivable. Sit back, enjoy the ride and when you want something that turns the wheels in your head, go watch Shawshank Redemption.

So why no five stars? For one, I would've liked the trafficking part to be fleshed out more. Showing what the girls went through would've added more punch to the movie whilst adding to the urgency of Mills' mission.

The movie's beginning will get your attention. Early on there's an exciting scene with Liam saving a pop singer from harm as a part-time security man.
 At times Neeson seems to have super-human powers, a super-hero impervious to bullets. Why are the bad guys after firing off fusillades of firepower unable to hit their target? Bad aim? Neeson's car is riddled with countless bullet holes, yet he emerges unscathed. He's Superman without the tights.

5942566,5,B00ANT85VY,"As if the lousy economy weren't enough of a reason to say ""Hells to the no!"" when your kids plead and beg to go on a European jaunt, here comes TAKEN, a film that you can show on a back-to-back-to-back screening marathon along with the HOSTEL frightfests. That should make the kids waver a bit. And I bet those poor souls in HOSTEL were wishing for a parent like Liam Neeson. My favorite part of TAKEN may well be the low key yet very ominous promise Neeson makes on the phone to the kidnappers who had just snatched his daughter. I got dem shivers of anticipation coursing up and down the spine, watching him deliver this speech in the film trailer; in the actual film, it resonates with even more power. And I'm sorry - I need to quote him:

""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have... are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you. I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you.""

The response: ""Good luck.""

Oh, it is so on now!

Plot, simple: Ex-black ops agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) retired so that he can spend time with his neglected 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), although nowadays Kim doesn't really have much time for him. But she manages to guilt him into signing his permission for her to go holidaying in Europe. Mills doesn't like it one bit. He knows how the real world works, but his daughter just wants to follow a rock band as it tours across Europe. Mills' worst fears surface when Kim and her friend are promptly kidnapped in Paris. Except Bryan Mills isn't your ordinary dad.

Clocking in at slightly over an hour and a half, TAKEN is a stripped-down, bare-knuckled thriller; it doesn't try to be fancy, doesn't overcomplicate the story. It's about a father, trained in espionage and combat, willing to do whatever is needed, willing to take on anyone in his way, to get his daughter back. And that's it. Above all, this movie works because it's Liam Neeson propelling the story. Neeson is a first-rate actor and the man can convey seething rage and righteous fury like nobody's business. And, for someone somewhat in his dotage, he brings such big physical presence to the screen that you buy into his character being this dangerous and capable and ruthless.

A geriatric version of Jack Bauer? Yes - this man does not eff around. Some of the brutal things Mills resorts to has him straddling the fence between good guy and villain. But I tend to forgive him, given what's driving him. But, heh, it's pretty much a given that his friendship with his French contact is now effectively ruined.

Holes in the film? Yes, some. Although it's just about a given that Mills is able to survive hail after hail of bullets; that just seems to go with the territory, in these films. But Bryan Mills, impressive spy skills aside, does get by some on preposterous sheer luck (especially with the jacket). And then, after wreaking so much havoc in Paris, he seemingly is able to get out of France with his daughter fairly easily. See, father and daughter reunite and hug it out in Paris. Next thing you know, they're strolling in L.A.X. (although, okay, for all we know, they may have spent frustrating weeks in Paris swimming thru red tape; the movie doesn't indicate how much time has elapsed). My biggest gripe lies in the shakedown scene, when Mills accosts the Albanians in their HQ and pretends to be French authority - while talking in English with not even a French accent, much less actually speaking in French. And the saps buy this? Unless, of course, Mills pulled the old Jedi mind trick on them. In which case, it all makes sense.

But I'm just nagging. Liam Neeson is so good an actor that for the most part he sweeps you into his character's obsessed hunt. Regardless of plot inconsistencies and action movie cliches, TAKEN turns out to be a lean and mean thriller, and worth watching. And Liam Neeson, he runs this joint.",1237334400,,4182,4.479002624671916
5942567,4,B00ANT85VY,"Whoa!  ""Taken"" written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel moves quickly through its 94 minutes with the assuredness of a film that makes no claim to be anything than what it is--pure adrenaline producing action that entertains.

Don't expect any hidden political agendas or veiled messages about the state of the world.  Don't analyze each and every segment thinking that every ""i"" will be dotted and every ""t"" crossed.  Just sit back, buckle an imaginary seatbelt and prepare yourself for a wild ride driven by the pathos of a loving father whose winsomely innocent daughter finds herself at the mercy of the big bad world.

""Taken,"" starring the ever-endearing Liam Neeson as an ex-CIA operative whose one-track mind seems rooted in the desire of seeing Kim, his gangly, albeit charmingly so, seventeen year old daughter maturing happily and comfortably under his meticulous auspices despite the fact that she lives apart from him with her rather angry mother (Famke Janssen) and rich stepfather, shoves the nasty demimonde of crime organized to feed the exploitive tastes of rich degenerates in our faces.  As horrific as all this is, the quick pace of the story, forces us to react as quickly as Neeson does as he forges along through his once familiar stomping ground foiling the plans of an Albanian gang intent on human trafficking when they snatch the virginal Kim during a vacation in Paris.

Neeson takes no prisoners.  He is a one-man killing machine.  Ludicrously, the bullets fly, the fists slam into faces and kidneys with the same lethal accuracy displayed by celluloid hero, Jason Bourne played by Matt Damon but without Bourne's robotic nonchalance.  Papa Neeson's face bleeds with anguish raw enough for the audience to warily sense like some automatic hormonal discharge that one can smell and taste and rawer still to barely interpret as something so distressful, lingering on it for too many seconds would shatter the rationale to a point of being unable to function.  Neeson conveys this reaching of his emotional limit and his need to turn away from dwelling on it to perfection.  As he stumbles through a tented makeshift whorehouse on a construction site, pulling back curtain after curtain revealing one stoned and under-aged girl after another, we see the pain in his eyes.  The images flash with such feral brutality and stark intensity that we know he must push them from his mind to achieve the goal of finding his girl. Neeson works this part with such emotional nuance, that when he flattens each of his adversaries, there is no question in the audience's mind on how he did it.  We simply believe it.

Bottom line?  ""Taken"" follows the Bourne trilogy school of rapid-fire action cinema.  Its fun, escapist fare and Liam Neeson hones his part like a master craftsman as a concerned papa looking out for his only daughter.  Some grisly scenes of torture, adult themes of sexual slavery and stereotypical Eastern European and Middle Eastern bullies abound. Nevertheless, recommended.

5942568,5,B00ANT85VY,"Saw this one in the movies and what a great movie!  Granted, this is sensitive subject matter, something that you have been hearing about repeatedly in movies and television specials over the last couple of years.  This movie is about human trafficking--in other words, stealing young girls, rendering them helpless with drugs, and then selling them into prostitution to the highest bidder, usually in a foreign country.

With that said, Bryan (Neeson) and former wife Lenore are divorced.  Lenore has remarried a rich businessman.  Bryan and Lenore's daughter Kim is now 17 and lives with Lenore.  Bryan sees Kim when he wants but Lenore is kind of icy toward him, still apparently blaming him for the years he wasn't there for mother and daughter.  As a now retired CIA field operative (apparently well thought of and quite proficient in his job), Bryan wants to get to know his little girl better now.  The movie begins as he reminisces about Kim's 5th birthday and subsequently takes a present to her 17th birthday party at the mansion.

In the very beginning, Bryan helps a few of his CIA buddies with a side job as a bodyguard to a singer at a concert and befriends her when he saves her life.  You see Bryan's well choreographed protective moves as he puts down the offender and your confidence level in Bryan's abilities soar.  The singer offers to help Kim get a start singing (if she is as good as Bryan says).  Excited to tell Kim, Bryan is mentally slapped in the face when he finds that Kim wants to meet with him over lunch only to get his signed permission to go to Europe with her girlfriend.  Reluctantly, he agrees to sign and off she goes, with conditions to check in daily on the cell phone Bryan gives her.

No sooner does the plane land in Paris, than the girls are greeted by a 2-legged snake who is part of an Albanian trafficking ring.  Peter offers to share a taxi with them (to split the expense).  Finding out where they live, he is able to contact the thugs who show up to grab them.  Kim is talking to her father on the cell when she sees the bad guys grab her girlfriend from a window and it is a chilling moment when Bryan says ""You will be taken"" and to leave the cell phone on.  A few moments later, my heart sank as they grabbed Kim, screaming and thrashing and drug her from under the bed.  Bryan tells the kidnappers to turn her loose and he won't kill them.  Of course, the ego-driven, invincible bad guys tell him something similar to ""good luck"". Well, the Albanians just unleashed their worst nightmare! Bryan, with all his training and skills in tact, is quickly on a plane to Paris on a hell-bent mission to get Kim back, no-holds barred.

This is a kick-butt movie, full of intense action, stunts, car-chases, and killing.  While I'm not normally big on watching people get killed, I have to admit, the bad guys and their crimes were so despicable that I did enjoy seeing them get taken out, one by one.  There is edge-of-your-seat action as Bryan hunts down the bad guys one by one and weaves his way through the network of filth to try to find his little girl.

Although extremely unlikely that he would have ever found her, it was a great movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Considering the subject matter, it was done fairly tastefully, too.
From what I remember, you did not actually see the sexual acts or the girls getting drugged.  A lot of people do get shot and someone does get tortured to find out needed information.

Quite possibly, more of our teenagers need to be sensitized to the facts that these things do happen.  Although no one should live in fear, young women do need to exercise sufficient caution about where they go and who they go with. I hope this film will both entertain and educate our young people.",1237075200,2,3774,4.51840942562592
5942569,3,B00ANT85VY,"This movie was incredibly unoriginal and very typical. I could have seen the outcome a mile away. It is so unoriginal that you could have predicted the outcome if you know your film qualities. People that gave this 5 stars must be those that are easily satisfied. Nowadays, you can't just judge the quality of the film just based on directing and acting, but also how unique their ideas are.

Why make a film that has been made dozens if not hundreds of times over? Don't encourage filming of this kind, they need to be more original. I'm hard to please, but at least you're hearing it from someone that has some idea of what he's talking about.

This is still my opinion and to be honest, I would give this film a 3.5 almost 4 because it is slightly entertaining. It has your typical fighting action, those found in Steven Seagal movies.

Watch me sum it up in a few short sentences, this is when you know the movie's plot is actually really lame. Ex-CIA predicts something bad will happen and the other person that he warns it to still does it, then they get in trouble, then he tells the bad guys he's going to catch them, then he goes and catches them.

YES! Don't believe me? Watch it. It is still a decent watch and it entertained me, but expect nothing original.

Stop giving it 5 stars, that's why 5 star movies among numerous other things on amazon are not taken seriously. People are sometimes paid to give movies 5 stars or some people are just simply way too easy to satisfy. I've never written my reviews to have people agree with me, just a thought that maybe it'll make you think a bit harder next time when you see glowing reviews about something.",1237075200,6,1663,4.403908794788274
5942570,3,B00ANT85VY,"This was much better than I expected it to be. Liam Neeson is a teriffic actor of that there is no doubt, but my fear was that this would just be another formula action movie, which would give the makers an excuse to have a lot of explosions and car chases.

In fact its a decent thriller, which at around an hour and a half doesn't outstay its welcome. The first half of the movie is surprisingly well controlled, giving you a chance to both sympathise and get frustrated with Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) already difficult relationship with his daughter.

The movie changes up a gear at the halfway point and for me this doesn't quite work. The plot gets less and less beliveable and our hero avoids thousands of rounds bullits. However, its still better than a lot of formula actions movies. This is mainly thanks to Liam Neesons fine acting (as always) and the good use of locations in France. Its always great to see a film shot outside of the U.S.

Overall then if you suspend belief this is a fine action movie. Its not in the same class as the first Bourne film, but there are many many worse films out there.",1236988800,14,1114,4.398058252427185

So called ""white slavery"" is very real and Leeson pulls no punches in the single-minded pursuit of dealing the first deadly blow to those who profit from the human trade.

This very fast-paced actioner does not rely on gimmicky technology or special effects.  One-to-one human combat (Isreali style?) prevails in tightly choreographed fights that are believable.

I saw the Euro version -- probably a few minutes of added intensity.

Neeson ought to consider this character as a franchise.  Kinda made me think of a slightly older Bourne.

What parent couldn't identify with that?  Taken has just enough story build up to interest you in the characters and give a basic idea of the family dynamic, before all hell breaks loose. It may not have perfect character development to those looking for deep and involved stories, but just the right amount for Taken.  You will be rooting for the character, period.  Once it is started, the action is non stop...realistic action and reactions, with some very satisfying moments I might add.  Without spoiling anything, as a whole it is probably not too realistic (although its a very nice thought), taken part by part very well done.",1236470400,3,772,4.7669172932330826
5942574,4,B00ANT85VY,"'Taken' is a great action movie.  Liam Neeson is cast in the role of an ex-special agent who has left his job to live nearer to his daughter.  He and his wife are divorced and his daughter lives with her mother and step-father who are quite wealthy and not as protective of her as Liam Neeson is.  His daughter travels to France with a friend and is abducted by white slave traders shortly after she arrives there.  Just as she is being abducted she is speaking to Liam Neeson on the phone.  He gives her instructions on what to do.  The abductors pick up the phone and Liam Neeson tells them to release his daughter or they will be sorry. The rest of the movie is non-stop action as Liam Neeson flies to France in order to find his daughter.

One might think that this casting is out-of-character, and it is, but it is brilliant!  Liam Neeson may well be the next great action movie actor.  He is toned up and trimmed down.  Whoever did his training for the moves in this film is to be commended.  He kicks butt!

I have no doubt in my mind that this film will save some girl's life this summer. It has been a huge talking point in Europe, and I have no doubt that this debate will continue in the States over the coming months.

The kidnapping scene of Liam Neeson's daughter is well orchestrated with some neat editing that adds to the tension. The film doesn't waste much time getting down to the core of the story, and once it moves to Paris, this movie is a real roller-coaster of a ride.

I agree with one reviewer that this is Liam Neeson's best action movie since Darkman. The version I saw was the European dvd edit that I assume is a bit stronger than what is currently shown in North American cinemas at present. A word of warning, this movie will make you extremely angry at how young girls are manipulated in the sex industry, I guarantee it.

As already been mentioned by many reviewers, this is the best action movie in years, but most important, it sends out a strong message about young girls travelling abroad. It's been a long time since I stood up and applauded a movie, this happens to be one of them.",1236124800,2,1208,4.312775330396476

Mills reluctantly agrees (after pressure from his ex-wife) for his daughter to go to Paris with a friend, but shortly after she arrives, he receives a call from her telling him her friend has been kidnapped. Mills next words are chilling: ""You will be taken."" He instructs his daughter to put the phone on the floor and describe her assailants. When one of the kidnappers picks up the phone, Mills offers him the chance to return his daughter or die. And from that point on, the movie is constant action. Neeson reminded me of an older Jason Bourne, a man determined to do what needs to be done. He will stop at nothing in his efforts to find and rescue his daughter, and lets no one get in his way.

5942577,4,B00ANT85VY,"Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is thoroughly out of touch with his 17 year old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). For her 17th birthday, he gives the girl a karaoke machine while her rich stepdad gives her the horse of her dreams. He is very much in touch with the too-real world of crime being a retired 'fixer' for an undisclosed US government agency.

Bryan gives Kim grief when she wants to spend vacation in Paris with an older friend.  He signs her parental permission to go out of country with a long set of stipulations:

1. call when she's landed
2. call every night
3. call when she's ready to take off

Yet, the minute Kim sets foot on French soil, she's doomed.  She's not there a day before Albanian white slavers kidnap her and her friend.

Luckily, Kim's on the phone with her Dad when the kidnappers strike.  She gives Dad who has 'a particular set of skills' enough description that he's headed for Paris to get his daughter back and he's got 96 hours to do it.

""Taken"" shows you a very hard man with a very human side. Neeson's depiction of Bryan Mills is what makes an otherwise stereotyped impossible odds film very real and compelling. All through the white-knuckle suspense, you are rooting for Mills and Neeson just does not disappoint.

""Taken"" is not a film for really young kids.  It just barely comes in with a PG-13 rating, but it's definitely a film that teenaged girls could benefit by watching.  And action fans are going to love this one.

5942578,5,B00ANT85VY,"""Taken"" is great! This is how the story goes: Former government operative Bryan Mills begins the longest 96-hours of his life--and the hunt for the fearsome organization that has taken his daughter Kim. Mills had only recently given up his government career as what he calls a 'preventer' to be near Kim, who lives with Bryan's ex-wife Lenore and her new husband. To make ends meet, Bryan joins some former colleagues for special security details (like guarding a pop diva), but most of his time and energy are spent re-connecting with Kim. Bryan's familial goal is nearly derailed when Kim requests his permission to spend time in Paris with a friend. All too aware of the dangers that could lie ahead for Kim in a foreign land, Bryan says no, but Kim's disappointment leads him to very reluctantly relent. Bryan's worst fears are realized when Kim and her friend Amanda are suddenly abducted--in broad daylight--from the Paris apartment at which they've just arrived. Moments before Kim is dragged away by the as yet unseen and unknown assailants, she manages to phone Bryan, who begins to expertly piece together clues that will take him to the darkness of Paris' underworld, and to the City of Lights' plushest mansions. He will face nightmares worse than anything he experienced in black ops--and let nothing and no one stop him from saving his daughter.

The cast led by Liam Neeson (as Bryan) is great! The directing by Pierre Morel (who also directed ""District 13"" (2004) & the upcoming ""From Paris With Love"" (2009) is great!

The music by Nathaniel Mechaly is great! The cinematography by Michel Abramowicz (who also did the cinematography to the upcoming ""From Paris With Love"") is great! The film editing by Frdric Thoraval (who also did the film editing to ""District 13"", ""Angel-A"" (2005, which Besson also wrote, produced, and directed), & the upcoming ""From Paris With Love"") is great!

Sorry but Bourne holds no candle to Stallone and Neeson in these 2 films.

But both TAKEN and RAMBO are more than just action movies... they also have a message about our world today.

There is a difference between IDEALISM and REALISM and ignorance is not bliss.

Especially in America today Political Correctness seems to have made a large part of our population oblivious to the fact that real evil exists in the world and has to be dealt with.  Instead we have too many people turning a blind eye to so many bad trends and warning signs developing in our changing culture but they choose to stick their heads in the sand and think ""everything will be OK, people are inherently good"".

With RAMBO it was the well intentioned missionaries who could not believe they would run into problems in Burma (But Rambo knew better).

With TAKEN it is the naive, socially liberal family that thinks they can travel the world without a care (But Neeson's character knows better).

In both films, our central character has to rescue our idealistic, naive victims from the harsh realities that truly exist in the world.

5942580,5,B00ANT85VY,"The Liam Neeson/Luc Besson action film ""Taken"" pairs the Academy Award-nominated actor and noted action film director, writer, and producer in a story that focuses on the human trafficking network in Europe where young girls are forced into a life of drugs and prostitution.

Neeson plays Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA operative who has retired to spend more time with his daughter, played by Maggie Grace. Mills spent most of his career around the world pursuing danger, so much so that he ended up being divorced by his wife, played by Famke Janssen. Janssen has remarried a wealthy businessman, and her relationship with Mills is still frosty. Right after her 18th birthday, Mills' daughter asks for his signature on a permission form to travel to Europe with a 19-year old female friend. Mills balks, but after tears and a cajoiling from his ex, Mills signs the paperwork.

No sooner does she get settled in her guest accomodations that the daughter is kidnapped by an Albanian group trafficking in young girls from overseas. Mills springs into action, and travels to France, where he becomes a one-man wrecking crew bent on finding his daughter and returning her to safety.

Neeson handles the action scenes adroitly, and since this is already his territory, Besson and his director, Pierre Morel, produce a high-octane film that is fun, entertaining, and even manages to put a spotlight on a problem that is beginning to draw attention worldwide.

In addition to the riveting action, the subleties and no-so subleties of beign a divorced parent on the outside are handled accurately and poignantly. All in all, Taken is a great action film with a number of nice nuances around the edges.",1235606400,3,1686,4.968085106382978

I remember watching the trailer in the theater and leaning over to my friends with a look of glee and amazement.  We all knew we were going to see that movie on opening night.

And we did.

It did not disappoint.

It takes a minute to get rolling, but I think it only felt that way because the movie is so short (I think it's about an hour and a half long).  It doesn't feel like very long, though, as, once the action starts, it blows you away.  It's quick, gritty camera angles that really make the film come alive.  Some of the violence is so out there, yet realistic, that you have to cringe when you watch it.

At it's heart, it's about a man, desperate to find and save his daughter, and willing to employ any means necessary to get her back.  As the title of this review suggests, it's a little like 24 - okay, a LOT (with one scene ripped straight out of day 5, fans will know what I'm talking about), the man's daughter's name is Kim and she's been kidnapped and he's gotta do crazy bad things to get her.  It's enough to hold me over until the real 24 movie is out, BUT, it's good enough in its own right.

I love Liam Neeson in this role, if only because I was surprised that he could pull it off.  I kept hearing Aslan as he was making death threats and it was a little disconcerting.  But he makes me believe he's Brian Mills in every second of the movie.  The only thing I didn't believe was that he and Lenor were ever married.  They just didn't click.  At all.  Maybe it's good that they divorced!

It's definitely worth the rent, but even more so, it's worth the buy.  I can't wait until it's released on DVD.",1235260800,68,1807,4.2128279883381925

The 96 hour window our hero is given spreads thin as he uses his extensive training to find everyone responsible for her disappearance. Great movie, great effects. One of the first in awhile where I didn't find too many flaws, everything came together. It made sense and it wasn't just someone running around killing everyone, there was intelligence behind it.",1235001600,2,897,4.475609756097561
5942585,4,B00ANT85VY,"It's not often that Liam Neeson gets into 'butt-kicking' gear, but he does here for the Luc Besson produced 'Taken'.  The movie takes a while to set up (say, 25 minutes?), and from there on, it's non-stop action.  Imagine Jason Bourne as an older, retired dad.

The action scenes are done well, the violence is fairly graphic, and the movie feels very short (which is a good thing).  The plot has a few holes, but I guess that's to be expected with the plot moving so quickly.  Neeson does a great job, the rest of the cast is merely filler.

If you really want to laugh during the movie, watch Neeson's daughter when she runs.  It's hilarious.

5942588,5,B00ANT85VY,"I simply did not think this would be as good as it was--and I have NO idea why I thought it would be that way, but I was wrong--BIG TIME. I like Liam Neeson, but putting him in the same category as Jason Bourne, James Bond or Jack Bauer? I don't think so...well guess what? Liam was awesome as a father bent on undeniable, raging vengeance after his one and only daughter is abducted shortly after arriving in France.

The first 15 minutes of the movie sets the stage for what follows, and when the rubber hits the pavement, man oh MAN hold ON! We see all the behind the scenes set-up you'll need to accept Liam as a divorced father who spent way too much time away from family, ultimately paying the price as he finds himself divorced, complete with a relationship with his daughter on life-support. He clearly regrets missing out on quality time with his little girl, and attempts to forge a closer bond with her when she deceives him into granting her permission to fly to Europe to tour museum's when its nothing more than a ruse to cover her desire to hop from one country to another seeing one concert after another.

When his daughter fails to call him at the appointed time, he desperately tries to get in touch with her, and when he finally does, he discovers that she is moments away from being abducted. He fights back the urge to fall apart and gives her some valuable advice and sets out to find and then punish those responsible.

What an adrenaline RUSH. The film quite literally flies by so fast that before I realized it, the movie was over. At first it felt like I had been there barely an hour, but it was longer than that--it just flew by quite rapidly. I seriously doubt that Liam will receive any acting awards for this roll, but I honestly don't care. His acting was superb (as usual) but this type of film is usually ignored at award shows anyway, so no big loss there, right?

In short: if you enjoyed or really loved any or all three Bourne films with Matt Damon, give 'Taken' a shot, I believe you will be pleasantly surprised at how honestly GOOD it is. Personally, I loved it, and can hardly wait to see it again.",1233532800,4,2142,4.374371859296482
5942589,4,B00ANT85VY,"""Taken"" is a workmanlike action-packed thriller directed by Pierre Morel and starring the excellent Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills, a retired and divorced CIA agent with a daughter he dotes on.  Think Jason Bourne family man.

Mills can't hold a candle to his ex-wife's current husband, a Los Angeles fat cat with beaucoup dollars to shower on Mills's daughter dearest.  While low-rent Mills gives her a karoake player for her seventeenth birthday, Mr. Fat Cat lavishes her with a pony.  Mills leaves her birthday party feeling like a loser.

Though Mills is eking out a living from his retirement checks, what he does have, unlike his ex's husband, is a ""certain set of skills"" that make him highly dangerous.

The white-slavery kidnapers of his daughter find this out in brutal fashion posthaste when Mills rampages through Paris hot on their trail, much to their dismay.

Mills will do anything to rescue his daughter, even in one disturbing scene when he shoots the innocent wife of a Parisian bureaucrat during her home-cooked dinner to obtain the name of the white-slavery racket's ringleader.  Yes, Mills is a bit of a bastard, but he must be to deal with the vicious kidnapers holding his daughter hostage.

Co-written by Luc Besson (who directed La Femme Nikita), ""Taken"" is a fast-paced thriller that doesn't let up.

5942590,5,B00ANT85VY,"Don't let the trailers for Taken fool you, this is an awesome action flick.  The trailers might lead you to believe this might be just another corny action movie, but Qui-Gon Jinn kicks so much posterior in this movie that you'll be wishing for a sequel.  Liam Neeson is nearly 60 years old, but he looks at least 20 years younger in this film.  There are at least 5-6 big action scenes, with a lot of hand-to-hand fighting.  And there's none of the shaky-cam footage from Bourne Identity here- it's raw, and it's brutal.

Don't come in here expecting the English Patient.  There is little plot to be developed, few characters to delve into.  In fact, most of the bad guys don't even have names- the lucky ones might have a first name.  They're the most one-dimensional bad guys ever, but it doesn't matter, because they exist to be beaten up by Mr. Neeson.

The US theater release has been cut to a PG-13, whereas the original UK cinema version has been released as the Extended Harder Cut.  Action fan?  The extended harder cut is a much more visceral, and dare I say, more enjoyable, film.",1232668800,5,1092,4.520408163265306
5942591,4,B00ANT85VY,"The most succinct way to describe this Luc Besson scripted revenge flick starring Liam Neeson is to picture what would happen if Jason Bourne retired and had his daughter kidnapped in Paris. However, this film is a revenge film and not a spy thriller, so don't go looking for any heavy character development or government mysteries. Nor does this film  have a Bourne-sized budget, and some of the ""bigger"" action scenes suffer for it.

What this film does have is Liam Neeson as a one man dispenser of asskickery who pistolwhips and throat chops more bad guys in one scene than Damon did in all the Bourne films combined. Maggie Grace (Remember her from seasons 1 & 2 of LOST?) does an amicable job as the daughter in distress, but the main attraction for action fans is seeing in what way Neeson's PO'd poppa is going to exact his brand of justice next.",1232323200,,854,4.57516339869281

Nowadays everything is CGI matrix style (which I have no problem with) but sometimes, a guy kickin' butts and busting heads is extremely refreshing. Neeson's performance is superb. Flawless. This guy is like a hybrid between Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer. The sound in the movie is also awesome. If you have a good Home Theater system (How someone can own a Blu-Ray player and a have bad Home Theater system is beyond me), put this movie in your Blu-Ray player, get some popcorn and blast away.

When a simple trip abroad puts his daughter and her friend in danger, he must swing back into action.  Visually, the movie is very well shot and will be a pleasure to watch in standard definition or Blu-Ray.  But the weak story holds back a movie that could have been much better.

This film deals with kidnapping and human trafficking, very serious problems which have become overused in films of recent memory.  This film is entertaining as an action movie, though somewhat predictable.  But as a movie about human trafficking, the script is filled with numerous holes and inaccuracies that make it less than believable.  The less you know about the topic, the easier it will be for you to suspend disbelief and enjoy this as surface level entertainment.

As Bryan Mills, Neeson attempts to channel a composite of Matt Damon's character from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Identity/dp/B00023B1LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Identity</a>&nbsp;with Denzel Washington's character from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-on-Fire/dp/B00005JN0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man on Fire</a>.

Bourne's odyssey and skills are easier to believe because of the economy of dialogue and the way the back-story is slowly fed to us.  In addition, the script of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Identity/dp/B00023B1LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Identity</a>&nbsp;was clearly well vetted and researched.  Here, Neeson's character says and does things that no trained security professional would ever do, like warning the villains that he is a trained security professional and that he is coming for them.  He is clearly no Bourne.

In comparison with Denzel Washington's character, Neeson is not given nearly as much to work with in terms of emotion and dimension.  Denzel was given a character we could relate to through his human frailty.  But Neeson is given a wooden role with one-dimensional motivation.  One can even think to Russel Crowe's role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Proof-of-Life/dp/B00005BCKF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Proof of Life</a>&nbsp;as another point of comparison.  It's easy to see how little Neeson is given to work with here.

The supporting cast is good, and includes Famke Janssen as Neeson's ex-wife.  However, there is a rather lengthy back-story that attempts to develop Neeson's character.  We get to meet his former security buddies and get to see how he interacts with his ex-wife and how much he sacrifices for his daughter.  By the time we get to the heart of the film, it's clear that much of that back-story could have been told in half the time to better effect.

About half of the early cast could have been cut.  Similarly there are a lot of supporting scenes that could have been trimmed to maintain the suspense at a higher level.  The result is a movie with choppy pacing that drags on and feels longer than it is.

The irony of that is that there is already an extended ""harder"" cut set to be released on Blu-Ray.  I will suspend disbelief till I see the extended version, but it's difficult for me to imagine making this movie better by adding scenes.  It seems like much of what was included could have made this movie better by being pared away.

**** MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD -- STOP NOW TO AVOID ****

As with any action movie, there are a number of fight scenes where Neeson seems to gain super-human dexterity, unlimited strength and omnipresent knowledge of all of his enemies.  Believe it or not, I can somewhat accept his ability to defeat any number of opponents as an action movie standard.  The fight choreography is actually very good as a whole.

However, it gets worse. The numerous errors in the supporting sequences make it difficult to suspend disbelief.  With almost no information, he is able to ID his adversaries from some imaginary database that could only exist in the mind of a Hollywood producer and would never work in practice.  It's hard to believe that Neeson goes to Paris, after having been retired from overseas duty for several years, and somehow all his contacts are still there in roughly the same roles ready to provide him lodging and resources.

Of course, everybody in Paris speaks English to him with pleasure.  Did any of the writers actually go to Paris for research before this movie?  It's difficult to accept that he could wander into a crime den masquerading as a French security agent while speaking English.  Then again, considering the same people he confronts have already gotten a visual ID on him, it's absurd that he isn't immediately shot.

But then, to insult our intelligence even further, once we get to the climax scene and witness the people actually engaging in the human trafficking, we are shown a scenario that makes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000UNYK3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>&nbsp;seem plausible.  I don't want to give too much away.  But if you do get to see it ask yourself, ""would people breaking the law do so in this way?""

Once again, if you can suspend disbelief some of those many things will not bother you as much.  But this is just the tip of the iceberg.

CONCLUSION

This movie is OK, hence my average rating.  It's a good way to pass the time, and those who love foreign thrillers and action movies will enjoy the fight scenes and top notch camera work.  But the predictable plot and factual errors undercut what could have been a much better movie.  Neeson is a very good actor, but he can't make up for a script that needed to be vetted by several fact checkers before the final cut.

Judging by the enthusiastic foreign response to this movie, I can only hope that a completely separate cut was release for the European market.

This is worth seeing for mindless entertainment, but if you're expecting something as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Identity/dp/B00023B1LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Identity</a>&nbsp;you will likely be disappointed.

5942595,5,B00ANT85VY,"Front and center are Liam Neeson's strong acting skills. Just seeing Neeson's versatility made the whole film worth it.

This is one of those types of films that keeps you riveted to your seat during the first presentation, but on successive views the film begins to stretch the limits of plausibility. For example: What is the likelihood that Neeson's character could go into a house full of mobsters and pose as an English speaking French police officer-- and use English as the language of extortion? Another example: What is the likelihood that someone would choose to execute a person and just as they started strangling him that the pipe on which he was suspended break in such a way as to knock out two of the would be assassins? Third: How is there a party with so many people (with automatic and semi automatic weapons) where young girls are  being sold that happens-- and not authorities know that this is happening?

One thing that this does make the viewer want to do is investigate further into different types of sexual slavery-- if for no other reason than to ascertain the plausibility of the plot.",1230854400,3,1114,4.731958762886598

Written by Luc Besson and directed by a young director, Peter Morel, this thriller is told according the basic rules of this genre. It carves in relief the state of things in which the daughter of a divorced couple plans to make a trip to Paris in company of her friend Amanda (secretly they have decided to follow the musical schedule to U2), but his father who worked into the Intelligence Service is well aware about the dangerous situation.

Liam Neeson (an actor of multiple artistic skills who should be more requested) makes a very credible performance acting like the avenger father who will travel to Paris breaking any kind of law to find her, because he just has 80 hours to avoid she was sent to other destinies.

Full action, marvelous car chases, brutal violence and bloody scenes make this movie an admirable vehicle of entertainment.

Somehow this movie made me remind that psycho thriller of the 80's Frantic directed by Polanski and acted by Harrison Ford, in which his wife is kidnapped, in Paris.",1230681600,2,1272,4.794520547945205
5942597,5,B00ANT85VY,"Liam Neeson is one of those actors that although you will admire their work, Taken is a movie you could never expect them to be the lead in. It's a full blown action movie that challenges the 56 year old and his acting ability to appear cool. The film has its drawbacks, but they are all massively outweighed by the better parts of the film.

The film focuses around retired spy Bryan Mills (Neeson) whos daughter is kidnapped whilst on a trip to Paris with her close friend. He's a man who wasn't there for a lot of his daughters life due to his job, but is trying to make up for lost time with overprotective, suffocating fathering. Kim (Maggie Grace) and her friend are kidnapped by Albanian human traffickers whilst Bryan is on the phone to Kim. He tells her not to be scared and he will find her, he also tells the Albanian kidnapper who taunts Bryan on the phone. This leads into a series of events where Bryan is investigating the human traffickers in France using vigilante methods, but this is at the displeasure of the French authorities and an old friend of Bryans who simply want him out of France. He promises his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janseen, who quite frankly creeps me out) that he will return her safe and sound, at any cost but the only drawback is he has 96 hours.

This is a really good and fast paced action movies that has some excellent chase and combat scenes. Neeson seems to hold his own well and can display some excellent ability when it comes to those action scenes (although I'm sure a stunt double was cleverly placed in those scenes). Some of the dialogue is quite cringe worthy especially when Neesons character is on the phone to the kidnapper and he tells him that he has experience and he will be coming for them. It's something very clich and annoying in some respects but quite cool in another. The other gripe I had about it was the accent of Neeson. I'm not sure where his character was meant to hail from but it certainly wasn't American born and bred, or at least I hope not. Neeson's a good actor but he really needs to work on his American accent because it just destroys any role he's in when he's meant to be an American but his Irish accent clearly shines through.

It's a great film overall though and I would strongly recommend it to any action movie fan. He's good in this role, but I can't see him doing another role like this ever again as although he held his own, he seemed at times to be quite uncomfortable in what he was doing. The supporting cast are OK but nothing to shout about, the story is well done and seems to be quite intelligent in what it's talking about when on the subject of human trafficking. But what do I know, maybe this is the most inconsistent movie I've ever seen. If it is then it certainly hid it well. I just have one request to any future movie makers, please don't cast Famke Janseen, she's just weird.",1227398400,2,2887,4.382462686567164
