There are just no English subtitles, only Japanese. I knew going forward with this purchase would be a risk as the cover art used for this print was a known Japanese exclusive, but I was more than willing to take the risk and buy it seeing that this film goes for $150+ used! Also, I had noticed that many other American distributors (Target, B&N, Best Buy, etc) had listed this film around the same time.
I consider this movie a ""must see"", but unless you can read Japanese or understand Chinese, this is not the way to do it. I shall sit here patiently waiting for another Criterion Collection print I suppose...",1492819200,12,754,4.316901408450704

This is okay and I was already too old to take this very seriously but this is the kind of movie that someone who might live a  Charlotte Sometimes kind of life (melancholy for no reason because it makes my face look prettier, asian american, asian american, twee am I) might regard as the original to their bootleg.

I think the second half's inarticulateness is kind of spazzy.  I just liked the wry Cantonese in some of of it - not enough of it.

I am meh about this film but Tony Leung rubs his wife's leg in Grandmaster as a shoutout to this film.  Grandmaster is my kind of movie.  This one not at all.

I think this was a movie about being pretentious by someone who is not pretentious but is aware of the pretentious audience that would feel that this was THEIR movie.

The narrative style and the handle of camera is a delightful-watch. Wong kar reminds me too much the young Godard (specially for Pierrot Le fou).

819813,5,6304267835,"Chungking Express (1994)
Comedy, Drama, Mystery, 102 minutes, Cantonese Language
Directed by Wong Kar-Wai
Starring Brigitte Lin, Tony Leung, Faye Wong and Takeshi Kaneshiro

If you look at the cover of Chungking Express, you will catch a glimpse of some of the stylistic choices made by director Wong Kar-Wai. This is a film that intrigues me because of its style rather than the plot itself. Many of the images are blurred deliberately to reflect Hong Kong's fast-paced life. Other segments are shown in slow motion.

The story is in two parts and shows a glimpse into the lives of two policemen. The first has just broken up with his girlfriend, but he's in denial because it happened on April 1 and she might just be playing a joke on him. He decides to give her one month to reveal that she's joking. As she likes pineapple chunks, he decides to buy one can per day until she comes back to him. The cans must have an expiry date of May 1 as that's when her time expires. When she fails to return, he eats all of the 30 cans in one night. I mention that scene as an example because it demonstrates just how original the script is. The way the characters think and behave is extremely strange and that's part of the reason the film works so well for me.

There are essentially four characters in the movie. The first cop, after eating the 30 cans of pineapple chunks, decides to talk to the next woman he encounters. She turns out to be a drug dealer with an interesting story of her own.

The second story is probably the stronger of the two. It concerns a second cop who is about to break up with his girlfriend. She leaves a letter for him at a food bar he regularly frequents. A woman working at the food bar has a crush on him and steals the key to his apartment from the envelope.

The film contains a lot of humor, as well as drama and romance. It's just interesting to visit this strange world and hang out with the characters once in a while. The color palette and quirky plot reminds me somewhat of Amelie and it's not meant to be taken completely seriously. The story offers some thoughts on how random life can be. We can pass strangers in the street and they could become an important part of our lives in the future. One of the characters loves listening to California Dreamin', so be prepared to hear that throughout the second story.",1330473600,2,2351,4.407834101382488
819814,4,6304267835,"Lost love in the Hong Kong shuffle from four different, very mildly intertwining, perspectives. Moving at the irregular pace of life, its intentionally uneven gait is mesmerizing at times, slow and repetitive at others. Though the four alternating leads aren't the most varied bunch in cinema history, (the two men are overly self-absorbed and detached, while the corresponding ladies share a propensity to crazed social disorders) the inward-staring confessional nature of the story itself gives them each a special chance to shine as unique, relatable characters. There's a certain degree of the audience in each of them, and that makes each story tough to turn away from, even on the occasions when the plot has slowed to a walk. Though occasionally a bit over-ambitious in the wide variety of different shooting techniques it employs, the film is beautifully composed if somewhat firmly planted in the early '90s. Unspectacular at a glance, it's also strangely hypnotic and potently personal.",1328227200,2,996,5.310126582278481

That's my fault though for not properly researching more about it (I assumed it was region free).

819937,1,6304267835,"It's a bold statement, I know, but the multitude of positive reviews on this film only serve to fuel my distaste. If I can save just one person the agony of being subjected to this for two hours, then I will feel at least somewhat redeemed. That said, this film is truly terrible. I've tried to suppress my memories of it, but it is disjointed, repetitive, nonsensical, and utterly unbelievable. After looking at all the positive reviews, I am always astonished; did these people watch the same movie? Wong Kar Wai does just one thing well: he can recognize beauty. You put Maggie Cheung in a cheongsam and, whatever it is, I'll watch it -such as in ""In The Mood For Love"" (another basically bad movie). Put her in for even ten minutes, as in ""2046"", and I'll still watch (it's even worse). But he's just not someone who should ever, ever, direct a feature film. So, I'm saying it here: this is the worst film I have seen in 34 years of movie-watching. Do yourself a huge favor and avoid it at all costs, in spite of what all the art-house poseurs might say. It's just awful.",1282089600,8,1075,4.434343434343434
819938,5,6304267835,"Chungking express is one of my all time favorite films.  It is a story of human despair and loneliness told with a good measure of comedy; as such, it can be seen as a spin-off of the black comedy, which usually deals with more morbid issues such as death.  Although Chungking Express dwells on human despair, there is always a lingering feeling of hopefulness.  When you see a down-trodden person, there are three ways to go about:  you could either walk past the person with an air of apathy, you could kick him while he is down, or you could wrap your arms around him and hoist him up; this film is the kind of film that sympathizes with the characters and attempt to hoist them up.  It shows the audience that sadness and desolation are natural parts of life, but what one must always strive to do is look forward with optimism.
The direction of the movie is excellent.  The camera works in such a way that it feels as though you, an audience member, is right in on the action, standing beside the characters as an observer; as such, the movie has a deep, subjective feel to it.  The movie is jarring at times, but that adds to that subjective experience.  There are various points where the movie jumps ahead in timeline in very quick succession, giving the audience the feeling of the fleeting nature of time.  The movie does not spoon-feed you, rather, it asks you to think and to feel.  The acting feels very natural, almost improvisational, and it is required for a movie such as this.  Wong Kar Wai, one of the auteurs of world cinema, has made many great movies since, but to this day, Chungking Express stands out as his best, and one of the best movies, in my opinion, of all time.",1272844800,2,1694,4.432258064516129

The actors are stellar in this cast: Tony Leung, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Brigette Lin & musician Faye Wong in her debut role. A lighthearted look at life's relationships, this film is gem that shouldn't be missed.

819944,4,6304267835,"It's easy to see why this film catapulted Wong Kar Wai's status and is considedered one of the best films of the nineties. Not being a fan the first time through, the blu ray resparked my interest for this film so I decided to give it another chance. Lucky for me I made that choice.
  The first half of the film is rather funny dealing with a heart broken cop who runs into a blond wig wearing woman whom he falls for exactly 57 hours later. This is great stuff. The comedic timing of Kaneshiro and Lin are spot on. The smooth transition from the first story to the next is also marvelous. Wong's direction of this film is fresh and invigorating and gives a new meaning to say chick flicks. I prefer the first part over the second however many will tell you they like the second story which deals with a cop who, you can tell is pretty good at picking up women, but the one that interests him now catches him off gaurd so to say. Either way you look at it both stories are great and you get a little bit of everything which makes this a very special film. The blu ray release is perfect and I'm sure it's pretty much exactly how Wong Kar Wai would want anyone to see this film. Picture quality 5/5 Audio quality 4.5/5",1232841600,2,1218,4.200854700854701
819945,5,6304267835,"I really love this film.  ""CHUNGKING EXPRESS"" is the ultimate pop art film that won a lot hearts when it was first released and continues to this day.  And not only has the film jumpstarted the film careers of Wong Kar-wai, Christopher Doyle, Takeshi Kaneshiro and Faye Wong (despite having an awesome music career), ""CHUNGKING EXPRESS"" is one of those non-action Asian films that has continued to become a fan favorite for fans all over the world.

This film is now part of the Criterion Collection and when Criterion's name is on a film release, you know that you're going to get a quality release.
 So, what did Criterion do for this release?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Criterion is known to making their final masters to what the director's had in mind.  In this case, presenting the director's requested aspect ratio of 1:66:1.

The new high definition transfer according to Criterion was created on a Spirit 2K Datacine from a 35 mm internegative and a 35 mm interpositive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System and Pixel Farm's PF Clean. For a film that is nearly 15 years old, the goal for Criterion was not to give a crisp and clear picture but to make sure that the requested aspect ratio was successful and removing all the dirt and scratches that have plagued previous releases of the film.

Oh, and I just have to say that things that were cut out of the US VHS/DVD release are intact in this Blu-ray version. But as far as video quality goes, you will find the colors noticeable especially at the bar when you see the CD's in the jukebox spin and see the vibrant colors.

I have caught a few instances of color pulsing (due to the older print) and there were no artifacting. As for the audio, the original soundtrack was remastered by Tuu Duu-chih at 3H Sound Studios in Taipei under the supervision of Wong Kar-wai.  According to Criterion, the audio restoration tools have been used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.

The audio is what I loved about this release.  While watching the film and knowing that the majority of the film is dialogue-driven and as expected during the music scenes, to hear the music really become prominent but what I didn't expect to hear, which put a smile to my face is the rear surround and hearing the people talking, the cars beeping and while the front speakers were busy with scenes such as the lady in the blonde wig with the Indian smugglers, you hear the whole life of the city come alive through the rear surround.

Suffice to say, I was quite happy to hear the audio channels used effectively in this dialogue-driven film by taking the city's ambiance and having it come alive.  Well done!  And for those passionate about the film, hearing the tunes of ""Baroque"", ""California Dreamin'"" and Faye Wong's cover of the popular Cranberries song ala ""Dreams"" is just so fun and how music, even a few songs really made this pop art film truly shine.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

In the past release, we had Quentin Tarentino's introduction to CHUNGKING EXPRESS"", this time around with the Criterion release, we have the following:

  * An audio commentary featuring Asian cinema critic Tony Rayns who has talked to Wong Kar-wai in regards to certain scenes and also, we learn about how Chinese culture influenced certain situations such as the use of dates and certain phrases in the film.  Also, the reason why certain music was used and pretty much how commercials really influenced Wong Kar-wai for this film.  A very informative commentary.
  * A 1996 episode of the British television series Moving Pictures featuring interview swith Wong and cinematographer Christopher Doyle - This segment was made in 1996 thus the quality despite being in HD, is not too great.  But nevertheless, it was very fun to watch this 15-minute segment and watching these interviews with Wong and Christopher.  Really awesome details as the two walk into the places where the Midnight Express was shot and also the apartment actually was Doyle's apartment.  Very informative.
  * Then the US Theatrical trailer which was loved by American critics but unfortunately the film company didn't know how to market the film, thus it didn't do to well in America.
  * A booklet featuring a new essay by critic Amy Taubin - For those familiar with Amy Taubin's work on ""Sight & Sound"", Taubin really gets into the film and definitely writes about the film and its characters in a unique way.  Definitely an entertaing read for those who watched the movie.  Do not read this booklet first if you haven't seen the film.

The Blu-ray is presented in a digibook type of case with a slip cover.

I've owned so many variations of this film already that I can't help but smile throughout the film and just seeing how beautiful it looks on Blu-ray and how good the sound quality was and hearing so many things all around me.

For those who were expecting a digital remastered version that will have a pristine, crisp and vibrant look as some older Blu-rays have managed to have, the Criterion Edition is beautiful but not spectacularly gorgeous but for those watching a Criterion release, the goal is not to change the film and change the colors.

Their goal was to present the film with  the supervision of Wong Kar-wai and Christopher Doyle and how they wanted the film to be. If you watched the original DVD version or previous versions, this film has aged but with the Criterion edition, the video looks beautiful without the scratches and all the dust and looks cleaned up.  Personally, I don't know if we'll see the film any better than this presentation.  It's truly an awesome release on Blu-ray and absolutely love it!

I really hope that Criterion possibly considers releasing the third story via the film ""Fallen Angels""on Blu-ray.  Wong kar-wai created the third story for CHUNGKING EXPRESS"" but because it would make the film to lengthy, he cut it out and carried it over to his next film,  ""Fallen Angels"".  So, knock on wood, I hope that Criterion considers it because the treatment they gave for ""CHUNGKING EXPRESS"" was well done and definitely enhanced the whole experience for me, I found it quite beautiful.

Perhaps I'm a bit biased because I enjoyed this film so much but overall, this release is solid and definitely recommended!",1230768000,43,6325,4.755270394133822

820056,3,6304267835,"Criterion has all these great films sitting around begging for a release... why are they wasting time on films like this and Bottle Rocket, which have already been released on other labels for cheaper? Okay okay, they can add documentaries, director-approved transfers, better color, etc., but god damn it, why not release Pressburger & Powell's A Matter of Life and Death, or Godard's My Life to Live instead? It's not just Criterion, everyone prefers to rerelease stuff already out in ""better"" versions rather than give us the stuff that's just sitting on the shelf for ten years that no one has seen. Urgh! Anyway, I don't like Wong Kar Wai, I think he's overrated and between the grinding repetition of the Mamas and Papas song, the cheap flash of the ""action"" color blurred still montages, and the binge eating (don't tell me you ate four caeser's salads in a row from room service, that's expensive AND disgusting) I can't even think of this movie without getting nauseous.

He starts things off by talking about the origins of the film's title. He points out that both stories pair a veteran Chinese actor with a relative newcomer. Rayns touches upon Wong's multicultural background and how it informed the film. The critic also provides a brief biographical sketch of the filmmaker and how he to the point in his career where he made Chungking Express. Rayns also defends the film against the criticism that it is all style, like some sort of MTV music video. This is a very informative track with loads of production details that fans of the film should enjoy.

""Moving Pictures"" features an excerpt from this British television series which takes a look at the films of Wong Kar-Wai. He and cinematographer Christopher Doyle take us on a guided tour of the Chungking Express' key locations with Doyle cheekily re-enacting a couple of memorable moments from the film. This is a brief yet fascinating look at his films and filmmaking philosophy as well as a nice snapshot of where he and Doyle were at back in 1996.

820058,3,6304267835,"I really wanted to like `Chung Hing Sam Lam'; really.  All of the praise the film has received and all of the adoration fans shell out to director Kar Wai Wong, I just really wanted to like this, especially since my first experience with Wong's work (`My Blueberry Nights') was less than impressive.  I don't know if maybe it was a cultural barrier, but I just didn't get it.  I mean, I got it, as in I understand the point he was trying to make, but I didn't get the love for the film.  I pride myself on being able to indulge in foreign film, in fact some of my favorite films stem from Europe (Germany and Italy for the most part), but I have never really gotten into Asian cinema, and I understand that it is a completely different breed of filmmaking over there so maybe I just need a little more time to grow accustomed to it.

`Chung Hing Sam Lam' is split into two stories, both telling of a police officers loneliness and need of affection.

The first story tells of He Zhiwu (or Cop 223) who has just broken up with his girlfriend May and has decided to give her a month to come back to him.  May loved pineapples and so he decides to buy a can of pineapples every day for a month with the expiration date of May 1st and says that if she doesn't come back to him by that date then he will move on.  In the meantime he is hot on the tale of a woman in a blonde wig smuggling drugs.

This roughly takes about forty minutes to tell; which is sad because it was by far the most engrossing tale of the two.

The second story tells of cop 663 who has also just ended a relationship and is persuaded by the owner of a snack shop to ask out his new employee (and niece) May (a different May).  May is into American music (she listens to the same song over and over and over which serves as a hindrance to ones enjoyment of the film) and soon becomes infatuated with cop 663 (he is never given a name), but 663 is still hung up on his old girlfriend, a flight attendant whom he had a tryst with.  May winds up entering 663's apartment when he's not home just to be near him in a way and 663 finds that he is thinking more and more of May.

This section of the film was the weakest link for me.  The acting was superior to the first section yet the overall feel and pace of the story was dry and lacked any real connection.  Tony Leung is raved as one of Asia's finest actors, and he is (from what I've seen) a very, very good actor; and he is the best part of this film, but the material he's given is rather bland.  You'd think that his story would be interesting, but the film moves at such a pace that the emotional conflict between 663 and May came of dulled and vapid.

I just didn't care about anyone in this film, and in order to connect with a film you have to care about the characters.

In the end I have to say that Kar Wai Wong has a nice visual style (that's what makes the first section of the film so engrossing) but his decisions as a director sometimes weight down his films.  Both of the films I've seen of his don't seem to be refined or very well thought out.  For instance, I mentioned that May listens to the same song over and over, and that song is permanently imbedded into the soundtrack, even when it's just background music, and that comes off as an annoyance.  Same with `My Blueberry Nights', which kept the same Norah Jones song on repeat.  It is small details like this that can either elevate the feel of a film or drastically lower it.

I'm going to give Wong another chance (three strikes right?), especially since the most raves he's ever received go to his work on `In the Mood for Love' and I have yet to see that movie.  If `In the Mood for Love' proves to be worthy of the praise and accolades it's received than I'll look further into the catalog of Wong's filmography, but if it turns out to leave me cold like this one then I think I may need to give up on him altogether.",1219968000,5,3916,4.129117259552042

Many fine actors contribute but I must give special praise to tall, skinny and gamine Faye Wong. She's charming in the same way that Audrey Hepburn was -- but prettier and sexier. Like Audrey often did, Faye plays an ultra-free-spirit and is she a heart-breaker! Scantily-clad Valerie Chow provides some potent sex appeal in a couple scenes.

Quentin Tarantino provides an on-screen Introduction and Afterword. The Intro is a perfunctory welcome. The lengthier Afterward has some neat behind-the-scenes tidbits -- altho, he mistakenly states that this was Faye Wong's first movie.

820179,4,6304267835,"""Chungking Express"" is one of Wong Kar Wai's best-known films, and it is a good introduction to the work of this Chinese director. If you only like traditional movies, you will probably not appreciate ""Chungking Express"". On the other hand, if you are open to the unexpected, you may well fall in love with it.

This film has two different stories, connected by the fact that they are both about love, isolation, hope and despair. The stories are part of the plot, but the important thing here are the characters, and their feelings. You learn about them, and even begin to understand what they feel, thanks at least in part to the fact that you can hear their inner monologues.

The first story is about Cop 223, He Zhiwu (Takeshi Kaneshiro), who has broken up with his long-term girlfriend May, and is terribly sad. He reflects on his love problems, saying that ""We split up on April Fool's Day. So I decided to let the joke run for a month. Every day I buy a can of pineapple with a sell-by date of May 1. May loves pineapple, and May 1 is my birthday. If May hasn't changed her mind by the time I've bought thirty cans, then our love will also expire"". What can you do, when you watch his character buy lots of cans of pineapple that expire on May 1, believing that doing that will help him to regain May's love? Or when he says things like ""We're all unlucky in love sometimes. When I am, I go jogging. The body loses water when you jog, so you have none left for tears""? He is hopeful, but in despair, and the spectator cannot help but feel empathy.

The other story is about Cop 663, Chiu Wai (Tony Leung ), that broke-up  with his flight attendant girlfriend (Valerie Chow), and sums up their relationship in a few words, saying ""I thought we'd stay together for the long haul, flying like a jumbo jet on a full tank. But we changed course"". He is so sad that he begins to talk to his furniture, and doesn't even realize that Faye (Faye Wong), the young woman that works at the deli where he buys his dinner, has fallen in love with him.

What will happen with these two men and the people their love, or that love them? To know that, you have to watch ""Chungking Express"". Please pay attention to the beautiful dialogue, and the kaleidoscopic filmaking. I promise ""Chungking Express"" will be many things, but never boring. Recommended  :)

820180,1,6304267835,"Everybody I know loves this film. In today's environment, when WKW is being hailed as the premier director from Asia, and one of the world's best, I don't know how many really actually love the film, and how many don't have the courage to state a contrary opinion. Make no mistake, I think WKW is one of the greatest directors I have ever watched - how can somebody who makes a movie like ""In The Mood For Love"" (ITMFL) not be? Actually, his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like ITMFL, but in his versatility. It is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both ITMFL and Chungking. Well, his greatness notwithstanding, I can't stand this film. And no, I can't sit, lie, or do anything else with it either.

So what is it about this movie which gets my goat? The directorial style, and the cinematography. Actually, I think parts of the latter are great, and the parts I don't like are influenced by the former, so let me just talk about the former. WKW uses a particular style which extends across most of his other films, including ""Happy Together"" and ""Fallen Angels"" (yes, I've seen all of them, and hate almost all of them uniformly). The hallmark of this style is a very modern, staccato, piecemeal approach, stringing together relatively disparate ideas, scenes, or action sequences (almost reminiscent of Godard's ""Breathless"", as the editorial review says here, though not quite). His style is further marked by characteristic filming styles - for example, the slow shutter speed effect. Actually, this is one of his peeves, which even spills over to ITMFL, where it oh-so-doesn't-fit-and-stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb. Having watched nearly all his films, and having seen the wide array of situations across which is deploys this mechanism, and having spent hours analyzing the potential connecting theme, I can assure you that there is absolutely no uniformity and sense to its usage. It gets used for dream-like sequences, for grounded reality; for sentimental togetherness, for aloofness; for tears, for laughter; for thoughts, for action; the list goes on. WKW similarly uses other weapons in his vast director's repertoire to some bizarre effects, taking improvisation to an extreme where it stops being laudatory.

The above notwithstanding, let me round off by saying that if the kind of style I have delineated above appeals to you, then you should definitely watch this film, for outside of his jarring style, WKW has pieced together a great story and actors. As for myself, I will continue to watch every one of his films, living in the suspense of what this genius will do next - make me fall in love, or hate.",1156636800,14,2668,4.900442477876106
820181,5,6304267835,"I had previously seen Wong Kar Wai's two most recent full-length films (In The Mood For Love and 2046) and enjoyed them greatly. I just recently purchased the rest of his catalogue and have been viewing them in chronological order. Tonight I watched Chungking Express.

This film, like all of his films, deals with isolation, loss, and missed connections. It contains two separate stories which, on the surface, are not related. The first story I found to be intriguing though not really so inspiring. The second (which comprises the bulk of the film) was simply amazing! WKW really has a way of placing you into the emotions of his characters! His is an extremely voyeuristic style to film-making. As the story progressed I started to feel uncomfortable as a result of one of the characters' behavior. Then the discomfort gave way to exuberance and I was smiling and even laughing along with this character. I began to sympathize and (god forbid!) even condone what was happening. When the character's game came to an end (as it had to do) I was scared for her but was relieved when her victim(?) also sympathized and condoned her behavior. Then, the story took a turn and it broke my heart in a most profound way. WKW's stories always break my heart, but this one REALLY HURT in a more personal way! I'm not really sure why. But after all the sadness and pain, this story turned around and put the pieces back together!

Beware! This is not a film for mainstream junkies! If you enjoy challenging and thought-provoking movies, then this is a definite must-see! If you have primarily subsisted on a diet of mainstream Hollywood fare but are curious to see the treasures that are possible with daring film-making, then this movie is an excellent gateway drug!",1152316800,2,1759,4.7639344262295085
820182,5,6304267835,"""Chungking Express"" is one of my favorite Wong Kar-Wai movies.  It is lighter than ""In the Mood for Love"" and more accessible than ""Ashes of Time"".  At the same time, it captures beautifully the cramped, frenetic nature of life in the city that never sleeps and in particular the wierdly compelling Chungking Mansions which function as the backdrop and unacknowledged co-star of the movie. The action moves back and forth between Kowloon and the Central district of Hongkong Island and this ping-ponging backwards and forwards sets up one of the movies interesting modalities.  Another interesting contrast is between exteriors and interiors. In fact, much of the movie is shot inside buildings. For non-Hongkies this is a good introduction to just how much life in HK goes on inside, this is partly because there isn't much outside to be in particularly in Kowloon and on the island, and partly because so many of Hongkong's shops and restaurants are located inside neon-lit arcades and  shopping centers.

The original Cantonese title ""Chungking Forest"" actually gives a better sense of the closeness of the buildings and of the ways in which people bump up against one another and then interact or don't interact. Cop 223's (Takeshi Kaneshiro) opening monologue sets the stage for one of the movie's main ideas: the importance of random chance and the way in which characters are caught in webs of habit or mind which prevent them from connecting with others.  The physical landscape: dense, crowded and disorienting then becomes a metaphor for the disconnection of the human inhabitants of Hong Kong. A couple of interesting reviews that help to place the movie more explicitly within the Hong Kong landscape can be found on the websites LoveHKfilm  and HKcinemagic.ifrance

In addition to the backdrop, this film provides layers and layers of small details that add to the sense of place.  One of the best examples is the Indian kitchen-staff of the  inaptly-named Midnight Express (I'm guessing there is a film insider's joke here) take-away joint who provide a subtle chorus to Faye Wong's eccentricities.  It's this kind of attention to detail (another would be the incredibly sexy performance given by Valerie Chow as Cop 663's errant flight attendant girl friend), that distinguishes Wong Kar-Wai as one of the masters of atmosphere in modern cinema.

For me, the thing that makes this movie so engaging is the way in which the women are so much more interesting than the men, and yet so opaque as well (perhaps part of the attraction?).  Brigitte Lin's blond-wigged female gangster has the least to say of the four main leads and yet she is magnetically forceful from behind her perpetual sunglasses.  Even when asleep she commands attention and her character has the only body-count in the film.

So much has been said about Faye Wong's amazing and charismatic performance as Fay, the counter-help at the Midnight Express, that it seems superfluous to repeat them.  Wong is luminously beautiful, funny and alarmingly odd in equal measure. Forget the superficial similarities with  Audrey Tautou's fairly pedestrian performance in Amelie.  If you want any comparison, I would say that Fay resonates most strongly with the other great, semi-benign home invader in Asian film: the stellar Jae Hee in Kim Ki-Duk's 3 Iron.

Both Lin and Wong play women who are extremely hard to read.  Their actions are unexplained, their faces remote. Even as they both act on powerful emotions (betrayl and fear in one, obsession and fear in the other), they do so in a way that keeps the emotions themselves well below the surface.  These women are seemingly not tortured or unsure of themselves and in this regard they are far more self-possesed than the men in the film. I'm reminded a little of the way in which Ang Lee's female characters (pre Broke Back of course) always seemed to be the more intriguing and fully-developed than the male ones.

The way beyond the surfaces and the failure to connect, Wong seems to be saying, is through courage.  Andy Leung's wonderfully rendered Cop 663 is unable to face the reality of the situations he finds himself in, until he begins moving toward his own authentic life. Rather than continue to spin his wheels like Cop 223, he quits the force and reinvents himself. It's not until he's done this himself that he's able to take Fay up on her offer to fly off and see the world together.

This is a good-humored, beautifully executed and decent-hearted movie. It deserves a much greater following outside Asia than it currently has.  If American audiences ever learn to bust out beyond kungfu and cop films, this is the best introduction to intelligent, adept and perceptive Hongkong film for thinking adults you could ever hope to have.",1142121600,2,4777,4.971105527638191

820293,5,6304267835,"Chungking Express is cut into two distinct but tangentially related stories. The first involves a police officer recovering from a breakup with his long term girlfriend May. He is so obsessive that every day he buys a can of pineapple juice with an expiration date of May 1st (also his birthday). Eventually his paths cross with a cocaine smuggler who has been double crossed. The two make an unlikely pair, but the film is smart enough not to play up the theme of lovers (well, more like a lonely pair who happen to occupy similar space) from the opposite sides of the fence.

The second story involves another police officer and a local restaurant worker. This is where things get good. The second police officer has also recently broken up with his stewardess girlfriend (stolen from him by the police officer from the first story). The stewardess leaves a Dear John letter and the keys to the officer's apartment at the restaurant so he can pick it up. What follows is an energetic, funny, and ultimately emotional love story.

Much of the success goes to Faye Wong, who admires the police officer from afar (and eventually from not so afar). She's charismatic and an absolute joy to watch on screen. In fact she has enough energy to match Wong Kar-Wai's frantic camerawork. The role could have easily been annoying or downright creepy. She's downright charming. I should probably continue with the review lest my fawning will be seen as annoying and creepy.

I enjoyed the second story so much that I almost wish the entire film was devoted to it (although a majority of the movie is). Wong Kar-Wai seems to be playing with the theme of urban isolation. The contradictory feeling of seclusion when you're surrounded by throngs of people. Yet somehow, despite the competing cultures and fast-paced non-interaction, there is a thin thread connecting you to everyone around you.

I don't really know what Chungking Express is about, but I do know that it's fun. It's easily the best romance I've seen in a very long time. I can't remember the last time I've seen an American romance that was any good (do they make American romance films anymore, or are they all comedies with romantic endings tacked on?).

820295,3,6304267835,"I am always suspicious when I come across a movie that others are calling the greatest film of all time.

I'm also suspicious when others are praising the behind-the-scenes production, the camera work.

I have a very straightforward response to movies.  Either they reach me or they don't.  This one was somewhere in the middle.  I did enjoy watching it, but it just went in circles and didn't get anywhere, and some of the actions taken by the characters were incomprehensible, not really human at all.

The main action that stands out as incomprehensible is the woman who left, just left, rather than claim the man she had been in love with.  What is that about?  It seems that the only constant in this movie is that boy doesn't get girl.

Why did she get on a plane, when her idol, her obsession, the man whose house she had been sneaking into while he was away, was ripe for the picking?  Don't tell me that's the reason, that she didn't want reality to intrude on her fantasies.  Sorry, but that doesn't fly with me.  Even Amelie eventually kissed the boy she loved.

There were two love stories in the film.  I've described the second one.  In the first one, a man has just lost a longtime girlfriend, he gives her a month to return to him, he collects a month's worth of cans of pineapple slices and eats them on the last day of that month (his birthday), and then he tries to pick up a woman who is a drug dealer/smuggler/killer.  She seems nice enough, actually.  She is completely uninterested in him, and falls asleep in a hotel room next to him.  The end.  Nothing happens between them, and apparently nothing will.

So nothing happens in either story, and I was confused about the connections between the characters throughout the film.  There are two different cops going to the same deli?  They are both heartbroken?  At first I didn't realize that they were two different people.  I didn't realize that what I had here was two films, not one, and that I wasn't supposed to tie it all together.

Now for the strengths of the film.  Some of the characters are excellent.  I could really feel for the heartbroken man counting off 30 days for his beloved to return.  I enjoyed the character of the female drug dealer.  She was very interesting to watch.  The one character I had a problem with was the ditz who played California Dreamin' constantly on her boom box, kept sneaking into the apartment of a man she had a crush on, rebuffed his friendly advances, and took off without him at the end.  Try talking to a wall.  She made no sense to me.

One other problem I had with the film is that it kept bothering me with California Dreamin'.  I never liked that song.  I still don't.  I can see the concept of dreaming of a better place to be, escaping the northeast and its cold weather and businesslike atmosphere.  I have no problem with the lyrics.  But I hate the music.  It was a number one record way back when, and the radio played it every half hour.  That's too much punishment to take.",1120262400,5,3008,4.457720588235294

His way to study and follow the life of individuals, most often young and lost dreamers, trought beautifully colorful cinematography by Christopher Doyle and with some moody pop-music, has been an obvious inspiration for Sofia Coppola in her latest work Lost In Translation.
  Wong Kar Wai is a really unique filmmaker. As auteurs like Lars Von Trier also Wong Kar Wai tends to tell the same story over and over again.

820298,5,6304267835,"Like a sweet dream half-remembered, ""Chungking Express"" wavers on the back of your consciousness, seducing you into its semi-fantasy/semi-honest world of the chance of romance, and the necessity of proximity (0.01 of a centimeter is the distance of attraction) to filling an empty heart.  It is appropriate that ""California Dreaming"" is the background for much of the film, because dreaming is what the characters do, moving sluggishly through a life not quite real.

It is difficult to know what to make of the film at first.  There are two stories, interspersed with each other in through the film, both love stories involving policemen, a deli shop, and women whom they would love. Unlike ""Pulp Fiction,"" they do not meet up at the end, and the strangers remain strangers.  There is no neat package.  Rather, like Banana Yoshimoto's novels, they are linked thematically, with the same tale being told with different cast members, to see how each person finds their own ending, regardless of the beginning.  While Yoshimoto is Japanese, and Kar Wai is Chinese, there is a similarity in Asian story-telling evident in ""Chungking Express.""

As to this DVD, while it is great to see Quentin Tarantino bring Kar Wai's films to a wider audience, I find his commentary a bit annoying and self-serving.  Taratino makes some great flicks, and Kar Wai is an obvious influence on him, but he doesn't have the personality to comment on something so sweet and subtle as ""Chungking Express.""  This is just a personal observation, however, and others may disagree.

Director Kar Wai Wong is a rising star of cinema, seeping to the public consciousness slowly and surely, becoming less of a ""Hong Kong Director"" and more of an important contributor to modern film.  ""Chungking Express"" is a fine introduction to his work, showcasing his subtle love stories, use of atmosphere and disorientating techniques, such as multiple-languages and film manipulation.  Anyone who has seen ""Lost in Translation,"" ""Amelie"" or ""Kill Bill"" will find his films familiar.",1106524800,52,2041,5.114457831325301
820299,5,6304267835,"Located in the heart of mainland Hong Kong, the Chungking Mansions loom huge and ramshackle over Nathan Road.  Wags and scoundrels haunt its gates, along with a ragged assortment of Indian touts, whores and long-term transient workers from Africa.  Restaurants, tailors, psychics and a whole host of other occupations - some undoubtably illegal - infest the bottom floors in tiny, grimy compartments.  Chungking is also the backpacker ghetto of Kowloon: guesthouses offer rooms as cheap as $10 a night, and the loose, chaotic atmosphere is appealing to the more adventurous traveler.  When I visited Hong Kong for a week in 2002, there was no other realistic option, for finance concerns and the `lust for life' drive, than the infamous Chungking: intrigue seemed to lurk around every corner.  While staying there, my guesthouse manager suggested I rent and watch the *Chungking Express*, a 1994 film by Won Kar Wai, loosely connected around the building.  I never got around to it...until three years later...and in a way I'm glad I waited to watch this delicious romp about love, obsession and betrayal, for it sparked the nostalgia cylinders and left me in that awed, giddy state that only the best of films can do.

Made on the quick by Won Kar Wai as a means of rejuvenating his creative energy, *Chungking Mansions* originally consisted of three interlocking stories, but one met the axe (to resurface as its own film) to give proper attention (i.e. running time) to those that remained.  Of the two stories, only the first has any relation with the Chungking Mansions: a hard-luck dame scours the sleazy corridors for drug-mules, and I must say that the general ambience of the Mansions is faithfully captured.  The second story occurs in Kowloon and on the Island, and is connected to the first by one chance encounter (~a brilliant means of transitioning chapters) and the underlying themes of loneliness, disconnection and desire.

In the first tale, undercover cop He Zhiwu (Takeshi Kaneshiro) broods over the disintegration of his relationship with `May,' pining for his lost love with a rather unrealistic `period of absence' scheme and, after a time, seeking comfort from any chance encounter.  ""I'll fall in love with the next woman I see,"" Zhiwu vows in a fit of desperation; and who should come along but Brigette Lin, a mysterious figure whom we've already seen in dire straights in the bowels of Chungking.  This story has the visual glamour of noir - red-lit bars, blur-motion fragments of violence, a femme fatale betrayed and subsequently `saved' by the gentleman Zhiwu - yet the dialoge really makes it stand above more typical entries into the genre, especially Zhiwu's internal narration, which ranges from clueless to insightful to downright hilarious.  Slight but charming, with enough visceral action and mystery to keep the pace from flagging.

The second story is by far my favorite of the two, and most audiences agree on this, taking into consideration critical acclaim and the reviews on this page; it is easy to see why.  A cop (Tony Leung) stops at the same deli every day for his coffee and chef salad, where he meets and slowly develops a relationship with Faye (Faye Wong), a not-quite-sane nymphet who promptly falls in love with him.  Acquiring a key to his apartment, Faye begins to sneak in and rearrange her secret love's living quarters while he is gone.  Leave it to the Chinese to make stalker-obsession cute and poignant! Yet it works, due in large part to the natural sounding and psychologically keen dialogue of the script, and therein made effective by the acting of the two leads.  Faye Wong, perhaps the biggest pop/rock star in China, makes her screen debut here, and what a debut! It is practically impossible to not fall a little in love with her furtive, wild-at-heart character.  Wong articulates more with a mere look or throwaway gesture about the titanic struggle of repressed desire than most professional actors seem capable of.  Tony Leung, a veteran of Hong Kong's silver screen, shines as usual as the lonesome, half-oblivious cop, and his energy with Wong feels right, so natural.  This is very important in the later climax of the film, when the director stretches the tension to a breaking point and even manages to milk some well-earned trauma from these circling, faraway (so close) lonely souls.

Watching *Chungking Express* brought back a lot of memories.  In the background and seeping through the surface, Hong Kong glitters and roars, and the film itself eventually feels like an organic growth of the city, in tune to its rhythms and real-life atmosphere.  But one not need be acquainted with the City of the Nine Dragons to appreciate the quality of *Chungking Express* - this is movie magic in its finest form, infectious and reflective, a paramount example of Asian cinema at its most illuminating.

820301,5,6304267835,"Great film, but I believe ""somebody nobody"" is incorrect to call Faye Wong the ""Madonna of Mandarin"".  Perhaps he confuses Faye with the late Anita Mui?  Though Anita was primarily a Cantonese singer, not a Mandarin one, she - at least - had been occasionally compared to Madonna, given her wild onstage fashions and manner.  Faye Wong, on the other hand, shares nothing with Madonna that I recognize.  Instead, she has frequently been compared to Bjork and that gal from The Cranberry's (both of whom Faye has covered), though I think these comparisons pretty much begin and end with the covers (especially in Bjork's case).

Otherwise, ""somebody nobody""'s review is on target.

820429,5,6304267835,"This movie brings together a great cast, including the legendary Brigitte Lin, and the indelible Faye Wong.  Loosely speaking, Chungking Express is the unraveling of two not-so-separate stories about love and obsession.  The connection between the two stories is like a subtle undercurrent.  At more than one point we see the characters of the two stories cross path, much like anyone of us cross paths with hundreds of unknown faces everyday.  They are unaware of each other...why should they?
The film explores the nuanced boudaries of love and obsession, of fantasy and reality.  The characters are cops, a drug dealer, and a fast food clerk.  Their lives occur against the backdrop of the urban jungle that is modern day Hong Kong, where escalators are built so close to apartment buildings that when you look out your second floor apartment, you see shadows of strangers riding up and down your neighborhood.  In this postmodern and unreal landscape plays out the primal desires of love and obsession where hope, disappointment, rationality, irrationality, reality, and fantasy plays tricks on our minds.  All this is well put together in a tantalizing and sexy film.  (spoiler alert)  It pits one conventional love story ending with one not so conventional.  I've watched this film numerous times, and every time I come away with a reminder of how my desires is a delicate balance between sense and non-sense.

Yes, there is some stylish and neat directing to find here, as well as some weird and offbeat scenes once in a while, yet the movie is ultimately too long and it seems to lack a point. What begins as an appealing story (or stories) about urban alienation and the isolation of some japanese youngsters soon turns into a repetitive, tiresome and, at parts, irritating cinematic experience (""California Dreaming"", anyone??). The characters range from frustrated daydreamers to annoying and erratic losers who can`t seem to find a goal for their lives.

How does Hong Kong look like?  The marine club as in 007 Die Another Day?  As in Lara Craft?  NO NO NO!!!  The real Hong Kong is in Wong Kar Wai's movie.
Chung King mansion is a very special place, situated in the centre of the famous and glamorous shopping and commercial site Tsim Sha Tsui, is an old building full of mysterious people (mostly Pakistan)and events upspoken of.  The outdoor escalator in the second story is in Sheung Wan.  This is a monumental icon in HK, since the commercial sites are near the coast at the north side of Hong Kong Island, where the old and residential buildings are near south towards the hill.  The escalator is for joining both areas for people.  Wong Kar Wai is the only director who can bring these representable sites for foreigners.

  ""Chungking Express"" was shoddily filmed, slapped together quickly, and gives one the impression the plot could have been conceived by someone standing in line at a Hong Kong Burger King. I can't recall ever watching a film with such an insipid collection of  characters! I almost dozed off several times as I watched the one-dimensional cast plod their way through the mundane script.
  This embarrassment is an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialogue (a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that ""tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to mop up.) The same character is also seen carrying on a deep, meaningful rapport with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. The shaky, wandering, hand-held camerawork was another annoying feature I could have done without, but the most unbearable part of this artistic disaster is a long, drawn-out sequence where ""California Dreaming"" by the Mamas and Pappas is played over and over ad nauseam.
  Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company, though I can't for the life of me figure out why a man with his vision would bother.

I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised by the pace and humour of this film. Martial arts films are often either too serious or have a straight-faced humour running through them. This on the other hand was lighter in tone and even made me laugh out loud a few times. This tells us a lot about Hong King life and it is interesting to see how anglicised the (then) colony was.
I was baffled by people's comments that there were two cops in this film, I thought there was only one until I read the cast list, and it does seem surprising that Wong cast two similar looking men in two identical costumes. That's something that often trips up Hollywood directors, casting two lead men who confirm to a romantic ideal of what handsome leading men look like - i.e. slim, black hair, tanned skin, no facial hair and definitely no spectacles! There is no such problem with the three leading ladies, who look so different, it's clear who's who, although I must confess I was expecting the woman in the blond wig to have turned out to be one of the other characters by the end of the movie!
Confusion aside, this is great fun, and contains a skilfully chosen soundtrack, particularly the reggae track (which sounds like Maxi Priest, but there's no credits) and California Dreamin'. It's not a bad idea to use recurrent themes through movies, rather than to jam snippets of tracks in for the conventional soundtrack album, and this is just one of many ways in which Chunking Express is a welcome change from the norm.",1007683200,,1610,4.517123287671233

820645,5,6304267835,"The overpowering things about this movie were the feelings that it managed to capture.  The first story (which, for those who complain the second one is too long, is shorter in some versions) has a darker, lonelier quality to  it.  The second story (which didn't go on long enough for me) was  light-hearted and happy in a weird sort of way. Principally, this movie  turns around a place and a theme rather than a set of characters and a  single plot.  As with any serious artistic endeavor, the important thing is  the feeling.  Watch and feel, rather than analyzing-at least the first  time. For those who say it has no plot, well, it has more plot than those  movies you like!  It has TWO plots!  Twice as much as most movies! The  other important quality, for me, was the subtlety of how everything was  fitted together.  Much more is suggested than actually said.  In  particular, watch for the first scene Faye shows up in!  It's much earlier  in the movie than you might expect.",952128000,,985,4.551724137931035
820646,5,6304267835,"If you have any passion for the art cinema, any affinity for the French new wave and any tolerance for a non-static camera, then there is a good chance you will like or love Chungking express. To fault this movie for  having ""no plot""(and by the way, it certainly did have a plot -  just not one in the classical hollywood mould) seems quite ridiculous to  me. There are many categories of film - hollywood narrative, art cinema and  experimental to name a few. Wong Kar Wai is quite obviously attempting to  make a film in the tradition of new wave auteurs and independents like  Godard and Cassavettes. To fault a film in one category for not living up  to the conventions of another is akin to my complaining that a grapefruit  doesn't taste much like watermelon or that a documentary about giraffes  didn't have any wild boar in it. Do NOT buy or rent CK Express, expecting  it to be just like a Tarantino film.",949968000,11,915,4.457831325301205

Alanjay wanted a sequal to this one?  Oh please! If  you want exceptional cinematography, a beautiful lead actress, and A PLOT,  I suggest that extreamly weird flick ""The Pillow Book"".  Although  ""The Pillow Book"" wasn't that much of a good movie, at least it  had everything that all of the reviewers here claimed that this movie had.",949622400,8,506,4.629213483146067
820736,5,6304267835,"Wong Kar Wai's previous effort ""The days of being wild"" was a film which actully gave some warning about the CK Express in advance. CK Express is a film that opens with high energy camera shots and continues to  blast its way with an MTV style atmosphere with all the necessary camera  work and wisely chosen tunes. Story (or beter, the stories) are built on  main characters loneliness and one's search for salvation which will be  brought by a very very interesting soul mate for a short period of time.  Brigitte Lin was already a famous actress who successfully portrayed a drug  smuggler with a blond wig, trying to make her way out of the mess caused by  the betrayal of the loved one. Real surprise of the film was Faye Wong who  managed to pour even more energy to the film with her restlessness and  childish innocence. Camera work captures all the emotions especially with  the night time shots and Wong Kar Wai builds his stories brilliantly on  these ,portraying HongKong as the original neon city with lots of lonely  hearts. This film is a real art house treat to asian pop cinema lovers and  a referance movie for the students of cinema and movie makers world wide.",948326400,11,1180,4.588516746411483

820738,5,6304267835,"Whether you are a fan of Wong Kar Wai or not, the film is still, in my opinion, one of the finest art films to come out of Hong Kong.  The film is comprised of two independent stories, though some of the characters  cross-over, that deal with love with a very MTV kind of energy.  The film  stars Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Bullet in the Head, and Takeshi Kaneshiro, who  is in Chunking Expresse's sort-of-sequal Fallen Angels, another fantastic  film.  Hong Kong pop singer Faye Wong stars as does a blonde-wig wearing  (Brigitte) Lin Chin Hsia.  The film is very unique and entertaining even  after repeated viewings.",940377600,2,613,4.644859813084112
820739,5,6304267835,"Set in post-breakup No Man's Land , where everything and nothing proceeds in a half-awake haze, Movie No. 4 by the unstoppably cool Wong Kar Wai ,traps  the kinetic bustle of its polyglot milieu ( i.e. Hong Kong,  premillenial and agit ) on-cam , making this  engaging diptych about two  bachelor cops on the tailend of a jilt (Takeshi Kaneshiro and Tony Leung)  and their elusive and spanking-new objects of affection (Brigitte Lin and  Faye Wong), the most hyperactive movie about stasis.  Part Godard, part  guerilla , Wong Kar Wai is an iconoclast  infatuated with the pursuit of  happiness in a crumbling lifescape and ""Chungking"" is his  most  spellbindingly romantic. Despite its kinetic bustle, its traffic-blur  action and its throbbing pop mantras , all HK movie standbys,  ""Chungking"" has ,at its core, an intimate calm and wistful  melancholy closer to  Jim Jarmusch (""Stranger Than Paradise"")  than Ringo Lam.

That everyone no matter what their background is  experience the same up and downs that love brings.  I love watching this  movie, and I tend to watch it when I have the Blues.  The characters in the  film are so real, and they go through what I am usually going through.  The  positive thing is that it leaves you on a positive note.  So when ever I  feel the blues I love to watch this film.  It is one of the best films that  I have ever seen, because the characters go through what everyone goes  through no matter what their culture or background is.",924912000,5,726,4.197080291970803

I find the two main men hilarious and endearing (they're just so sad omg and Officer 663 talking to his wash cloth is the cutest thing) and Faye does an awesome job with her 'quirky' but adorable character. In addition, the movie does have a really great soundtrack, although I think if I played California Dreaming one more time my sister might actually hit me.
I don't really think this movie is for everyone; it's very different and doesn't align with the storytelling methods we're accustomed to, so some people will get bored. I do think, however, that it is absolutely worth watching, if only for the experience. It's great artsy movie to make you think along a different vein than normal.",1503619200,,828,4.879432624113475
