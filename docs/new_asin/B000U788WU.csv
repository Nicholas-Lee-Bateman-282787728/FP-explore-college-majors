One key missing element in telling the story of the boatpeople, however:  I do not recall any scenes depicting life in the refugee camps that spawned all over Asia during this period.

2917182,5,B000U788WU,"Seldom have I seen a film that almost brought me to tears. This film by writer/director Ham Tran did, and believe me when I say it is no easy task for me to be so moved and touched by a film. ""Journey from the Fall"" is a tale about the ""boat people"" from Vietnam, I've never seen a film that absolutely, accurately portrayed the harrowing experiences of these people. I was extremely lucky to have seen this film in a limited engagement in theaters early this year. (My friend Ken Lee has been relentless in convincing me to see this film, I'm very happy he did!)

The story revolves around a fictional family (based on real people) who because of the father's decisiveness to stay and defend Saigon from its invaders during the Vietnam war results in his family's hardships and eminent inner heroism. After the communist side won the war, Long, a husband and a father to a son, was captured and sent to the so-called re-education camps. He urges his wife; Mai, their son Lai and the grandmother to ""hop"" on the first chance they get to leave for America. Mai, Lai, and the grandmother; Ba Noi manages to reach America with the aid of the boat's captain who has developed a fondness for Mai. Upon, learning that his family has reached safety, Long becomes determined to escape and join his family in America...

The director's hard work and talent is awe-inspiring. I've read that Tran actually interviewed numerous Vietnamese refugees and survivors of the re-education camps, even examined photos to visualize/recreate the brutal re-education camps. His efforts are well worth the wait. The father's character Long's experiences are just the tip of the iceberg. The harrowing set designs of the said camps is very realistic; ironically, the camps have a sign that says; ""Nothing is more precious than Freedom"". Within these camps, prisoners are brutally abused by the soldiers who guards them, beaten to near-death and locked up in small windowless boxes; heated by the searing heat of the sun during the day and cold in the evening. They are told that they will be released after they've been re-educated but Long fears that he will die within these walls.

Tran doesn't hold back with the graphic nature of this film. Next up, he shows the experiences of Mai, Lai and Ba Noi in a small fishing boat headed for America. The director effectively took me to the dark, cramped space, full of seasick women and kids, so accurately that I almost felt that I was also in the selfsame cramped boat. It was very difficult to watch every painful moan of a sick kid, ailing women, the sequences had that very claustrophobic feel. The folks in the boat are in the mercy of the elements; shifting waves and the weather make their journey very perilous, and to make matters worst, the boat is attacked by pirates who indiscriminately kill, kidnap and rape the women. They tear their children from their mother's arms, all this brutality is very hard to stomach.

After Mai, Lai and Ba Noi finally do make it to America, settling in Orange County, you may think everything will be fine. Now, they will have to adjust to their new life in a new community where some welcome their presence while others disdain and gives a hint of discrimination towards them. Ba Noi takes care of Lai while Mai works her butt off in a sweatshop. Young Lai also has his own problems when he becomes a target of school bullies. I suppose one may say these hardships are nothing compared to their previous experiences. Once Long hears word of his family's arrival in America, he becomes obsessed and determined in escape.
Does he succeed? Watch the film...

The film's main strengths come from its excellent cast headed by Long Nguyen and Kieu Chinh (Joy Luck Club). Diem Lien is a Vietnamese pop star but in her role as Mai, she proves that she is more than a great voice; she portrays her character convincingly. The entire cast is outstanding; they all give the performances of their lives including the young kid who plays Lai. (In my opinion)

""JOURNEY FROM THE FALL"" is a true masterpiece. It takes us from the jungles of Vietnam, to the harrowing experience of the re-education camps and the horrific boat ride to the land of opportunity. Tran's talent shines through with his attention to detail, it shows that he made this film direct from his heart and with loving care. Tran's film is a fitting homage to the real-life tales of those survived this ordeal and gives honor to the survivors after the fall of Saigon; paying tribute to those who lived and those who did not.

As depressing the film's premise may be, I found one strong, very moving message; it is not glamorous and is one of the dogged against all odds lesson of human survival:
"" No one is going to help you, you may not be capable and your efforts may end up in failure. But if you may struggle hard enough to survive, then MAYBE your next meal is ALL the reward you will need"".
This message may not be pretty, but there is a lot of HONESTY that lasts beyond its end credits.
Nothing...I mean nothing can touch the human spirit....

2917197,4,B000U788WU,"I loved this story from beginning to end. Very, very powerful and emotional. It makes you appreciate what many of the boat people went through and why they needed to flee Vietnam after the Fall of Saigon.

The acting was great from all the main actors, and even the supporting cast. I watched it in Vietnamese with English subtitles, which added more authenticity to the film. I'm not very big on dubbed movies, and I'm glad I watched it this way. I'd suggest you do the same to get more of a feel for the movie, unless you aren't a fan of subtitles.

My only complaint was the continuity. The movie jumped back and forth timewise quite often, and I didn't think it benefited the story any. In fact, it made things confusing at times. I just wish they had a linear timeline, or a couple of flashbacks here and there at most.

Other than that, I loved it and plan on watching it again.",1371427200,2,884,4.345454545454546

2917199,5,B000U788WU,"Wow. What can I say - that I was blown away on every level?!!

What really lifted this movie for me was the exceptional acting and the dialogue - the script was superb. It was poetic and original. Im a writer and director myself, so the sheer quality of this movie is no doubt due to the incredible director Ham Tran. I have to applaud him for presenting this story in such a fantastic way. Every scene was beautifully shot and it was never OTT.

You have done such a lot for the Vietnamese community with this contribution. I am Vietnamese myself and was born in the UK, but the tales about the departure and the pirate attacks is very real and authentic - so many people never made it- you just never hear about their stories.

This is a film I will never forget and I am going to watch it once every year to remind myself of the real values in life - to put everything into perspective.

The soundtrack was wonderful too. I loved the Vietnamese songs in this and have already tracked them down on Youtube.

I have never cried so much during a movie - but 4 times during this one!

A big thank you to all the cast and crew and Ham Tran for writing and directing this. Whatever else you have coming out I would definitely go and see/buy.

My only complaint (not really a complaint) is that I wish this DVD was more commonly available - Ive had to order it from the USA. OK so I watched it online for free but it's so beautiful I want my own copy to treasure.",1306972800,,1459,4.170818505338079
2917200,1,B000U788WU,"As someone who fled Vietnam himself at the age of 5, I can say wholeheartedly this movie sucks. First off, the dialogue in the movie is very stilted. Normal Vietnamese people aren't so stiff. We're a very gregarious and happy bunch. If someone who never met a Vietnamese person saw this movie, they would think we were robots. This is not a reflection of the actors but of the script. It plain sucks.

The story portrays the Boat People as being a bitter bunch, angry against America. That's not true. Vietnamese people hold no ill feelings against America. On the contrary, we're very grateful that they accepted us as refugees. The movie has a very anti-American tone.

The plot of the movie is very depressing. There's really no joy or life in any of it. As someone who's been through the journey, yes, it's tough and I experienced things that were much worse than the movie, but I look back at it with fond memories. Grateful that I made it alive.

All in all, the film thinks that depressing makes for a good movie. It doesn't. I don't have anything against depressing movies, I just don't like this one.",1279756800,14,1109,4.562814070351759

2917203,5,B000U788WU,"This was a very powerful and emotional movie for me due to personal experience. My mom sent me away one of of those boats when I was 14, while my dad was still in re-education camp (translation: hard labor concentration camp). My mom only had enough money for my ""ticket"" so she and my brothers and sisters all stayed behind. The escape and boat scenes are very similar to what I experienced. I can't say about the re-education camp scenes as I didn't have the privilege of staying in a camp, however I did visit my dad a few times and the depressive atmosphere I remember is very close to what we see in the movie.

The second half of the movie that depicts life in America is very moving for me as well. All boat persons went through those very same experiences: learning a new language, working menial jobs, adjusting to a totally different culture, having chance meetings with people you know from back home, etc.

These chance meetings are more likely than one would think, due to the fact that a large percentage of boat persons eventually migrated to a a few large population centers (Orange County, Houston, etc.). Also since older immigrants never really fit into the new country, they would continue to stay in the immigrant ""community"" and would always go to the same community events, grocery stores, restaurants, etc.

As powerful a film as it is, it could have greatly benefited from a bigger budget. This last note is more of an observation than a criticism.",1229558400,12,1473,4.636015325670498
2917204,4,B000U788WU,"After South Vietnam fell to the Communists in 1975, many of those who were seen as having ""collaborated"" with the Americans during the war were sent to ""re-education camps,"" where they were brutalized and tortured until such time as they were deemed fit to return to society fully on-board with the repressive regime's mantra of collectivist solidarity.  Others, more ""fortunate"" perhaps, were able to escape the coming onslaught, becoming known internationally as ""boat people"" - though many of these refugees tragically never made it to their destinations.  ""Journey From the Fall"" movingly recounts the story of one family that gets caught up in both of these predicaments.

Despite a flashback-filled structure that becomes a bit confusing and even disorienting at times, ""Journey From the Fall"" is a wrenching and compelling tribute to the ability of the human spirit to survive under even the most hellish of circumstances.  The movie chronicles not only Long Nguyen and his fellow prisoners' experiences in the camp but the attempt by his wife, mother and young son to flee the country by boat (in fact, the last forty-five minutes or so of the movie detail their struggle to adjust to their new life in Southern California).  The movie is sometimes hard to watch - for writer/director Ham Tran never flinches from showing us the harsh reality of the subject he is portraying -  but there's always the possibility of better things in the future to mitigate the suffering.

At a running-time of well over two hours, the movie could have used some trimming to accelerate the pace, but the quality of the acting and the universality of the theme keep us absorbed throughout.",1229126400,,1678,5.014388489208633
2917205,5,B000U788WU,"Unfortunately I bought it as a gift and the recipient already has it. She, however, lived through it and states remarkably the DVD is genuine.",1222732800,,142,4.72
2917206,5,B000U788WU,"One of the few movies which tells the story of Vietnam after America left from the Vietnamese viewpoint.  Most Americans were relieved after we left just looking at saving American lives, but the hell of living under a communist regime is often overlooked.  Thousands if not millions of people killed, many more imprisioned and/or 're-educated', and still many more risking their lives to try to escape living in poverty and oppression.

The movie was well made.  The acting was very good, the filming was great, and the stories were compelling.  Although it was confusing at parts with its flashbacks and switching locations and timeframes.  It almost tried to get too much in.  But still one of the most significant movies about Vietnam ever made and well worth it.",1215475200,,767,4.9453125
2917207,5,B000U788WU,"When I was a 2nd Grader, around 1979 at Ruby Drive elementary school in Fullerton, CA, we had a sudden influx of Vietnamese refugees at my school.  I was assigned a girl my own age, to help teach her English, play with her and generally make her life a little easier while transitioning to her new country.  We were friends for about a year, until my family moved away and I never saw or heard from her again.  I remember my mother telling me to be very nice to her and treat her well because she was a boat person, and that her boat had been attacked by pirates and she had been raped, but I was far too young to really understand what any of that meant.  It wasn't until I saw ""Journey from the Fall"" that I really gained any sort of insight as to what she must have gone through.

Opening a window into someone else's experiences is one of the great gifts of film, and director Ham Tran has proven himself to be a virtuoso.  The structure of ""Journey from the Fall"", including multiple time shifts and scene changes, leaves one appropriately disorientated as the characters themselves are.  If people are still living or dead, if they have escaped or been captured...this information is put forth in a non-linear order so the confusion and ""ah-ha"" moments are well balanced.  He demands concentration and investigation on the part of the viewer, rather than just feeding the story to a passive audience.  One must think about this film, in order to get its full intent.

There is nothing of the beauty of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heaven-Earth/dp/B00031V21M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heaven & Earth</a>, which made full use of the lush Vietnamese landscape.  The camera is tight and controlled, and the pictures are realistic and dirty.  This is a very human picture.  The actors deliver stellar performances, including Long Nguyen, who was also in Heaven and Earth, playing the detained father, and Diem Lien, professionally a singer rather than an actress, as his suffering wife.  The storytelling grandmother, Kieu Chinh (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Joy-Luck-Club/dp/B00005JKGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Joy Luck Club</a>),  is also amazing, being the heart of a family that has had its soul torn out.

I really feel like I cannot praise this film enough, and I am only sorry that it took me so long to see it.  It should almost be required viewing, especially for those of us who had some experience with this during the end of the Vietnam War.  While watching, I couldn't help but wonder about what will happen to the people of Iraq when the US finally leaves, and if we will see another version of ""Journey from the Fall"" 30 years from now.  I also wonder about my friend from 2nd grade.  I can't even remember her name, but I hope she is doing well.",1214956800,15,2860,4.981052631578947

I had no inkling what those people went through on their various journeys to get to America.  All I knew is what I was told by my teachers and what I read in the newspapers.

Recall the 2004 national elections when some left wing politicians said that some of those left behind in South Vietnam - later sent to the Viet Cong re-education camps - fared pretty well.  It was like saying the Nazi concentration camps were picnic grounds.  And while this movie makes no political statements, it does show how wrong the major media outlets were and have been for a very long time.

The story begins with the fall of Vietnam to the communists on April 30, 1975, and ends in Orange County, California in 1981. Tran follows the harrowing fate and fortunes of one family (and in various sub-plots their friends). The father, Long, is imprisoned in successive re-education camps.

2917219,5,B000U788WU,"Movies can be many things.  Some are funny and/or entertaining.  But the more important ones are dramatic, educational, or historically significant and profoundly moving.  Rarely, very rarely, are we gifted with a movie that combines all the characteristics of that second description into a marvelous whole, and provides an experience that is truly meaningful on several levels.

Journey From The Fall is such a film, combining acting, artistry, a neglected but important bit of history, and a portrayal of the human condition under the most brutal and tragic conditions into a magnificent work that leaves the viewer unsettled, sad, and yet inspired.  Made by people who themselves lived that part of history, with painstaking attention to detail that will pull you into a world you have not known, like a walk through Dachau that sears heart and mind.

It reveals in part the cost of abandoning South Viet Nam to conquest by the forces of the communist North, and paints a terribly vivid picture of the heartless cruelty of the ""re-education"" camps, and the desperate and often traumatic flights of the Boat People.  Many scenes in it are not for the fainthearted or delicate, but they are, sadly, only too historically accurate.  It follows the often painful readjustment process of those who made it to US shores, and gives the Western viewer some idea of the truly heart-tearing dilemma of people forced to decide whether to stay in the oppressive land of their revered ancestors, or flee to freedom in an alien land.

This is a story which needed to be told, to shine a light on the agony and travail of those victims of the war's end, and the incredible courage of those who tried, sometimes more than once, to escape the awful existence imposed on them by the ""liberators"" of the South.  It serves to honor those who suffered, and help their children growing up in freedom to understand what their parents experienced to bring them to a better life.  And it serves to educate the rest of us, and allow us to both understand and respect their experiences, and be inspired by them, and grateful that they have come to add their energy and their spirit to this land.",1194652800,8,2172,4.811827956989247

The only thing I find lacking is a Vietnamese subtitle track.",1194652800,6,453,4.947368421052632
2917221,4,B000U788WU,"A grim reminder of what happens when the US betrays its allies and leaves them to face the inhuman, whether it be Communism or ... something else ... and why the Vietnamese hope there is a special level of hell for Walter Cronkite and the rest of his ilk who finally broke the spirit of America by their misreporting of the Vietnam War, portraying the Tet Offensive as a victory for the Viet Cong instead of the disaster that it was for them.

It's many portraits of man's inhumanity to man ... starting with the protagonist Long's insistence on staying behind while sending off his family to the ""New Economic Zone"". It's a cruel and unexplained choice. It's further confused when, witnessing the terror in the streets because of the Communist victory, he says, ""Do you think it would be any different if America had won?"" Not sure what he means by this crazy statement, but it seems inexplicably foolish, especially since he's sending his family there ... and it's not clear why he wants to stay, or what he hopes to accomplish, apart from being imprisoned and tortured. (That's where the atheistic regime's inhumanity to man is on display, with their re-education camps and using prisoners to stumble upon mines.) Perhaps this equating an American victory with the Communist one - thanks again, Cronkite - is the writer's bit of inhumanity to us and to the Vietnamese people, a little, cruel joke at the expense of the millions who suffered under the atheistic empire.

Then there's the ordeals of his family, who become ""boat people"" to reach the promised land. Seasickness, claustrophobic quarters, and pirates, scum of the earth who ironically mirror the entire Communist government.

But there's more ... his family also commits little inhumanities to each other by keeping secrets, silly though they may be. The grandma, apparently not understanding the fundamental tenets of Buddhism, prays to Buddha and credits him for their deliverances (quite against Buddha's exhortations to extinguish all desire, and quite against the dispositions of one who has been successful in doing so (Buddha) to lift a finger to help, if indeed he could, having attained nothingness). She tells the kid to write his dad, in order to keep hope alive, even though they've nowhere to send them. The kid is ungrateful to the mom, who works in a sweatshop. And so on.

The film feels overlong, but I suppose not much could have been done apart from mostly needless ""home movie""-style flashbacks. But, apart from the confusion mentioned above, it's a timely message to a generation who are blithely unaware of the Darwinist Communist horror, which killed orders of magnitude more people in ""modern"" times than all the religious wars of past centuries combined. (Hitler, also following Darwinism, ""only"" killed 11 million, whereas the Communists killed over 100 million.)",1194566400,6,2854,4.989495798319328
2917222,5,B000U788WU,"Directed and written by Ham Tran, ""Journey from the Fall,"" is a very emotional film. The films narrative is based on fictional characters, but in a sense these characters are representative of the millions of South Vietnamese who were displaced, forced to leave their country, or sent to re-education camps after the fall of Saigon. The film reminded me in many ways of ""The Killing Fields"" starring the late Haing S. Ngor. And while ""The Killing Fields"" dealt with Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge, it has much in common with the film ""Journey from the Fall,"" in that it deals with the aftermath of Americas absence from Southeast Asia, and what befell those who were left behind. In this particular film, the director weaves three main narratives into the film.

One of these narratives revolves around the father Long (Long Nguyen). It is April 1975, and the North Vietnamese have nearly conquered the South. However, Long believes it is his duty to continue fighting for Saigon until the very end. He tells his wife Mai (Diem Lien) that he must remain behind to carry on the fight, while imploring her to leave for America with their young son Lai (Nguyen Thai Nguyen) and the grandmother Ba Noi (Keiu Chinh). I found the fathers narrative to be the most fascinating in the film. As the film moves forward, the viewer is witness to the infamous RE-EDUCATION camps that were so prominent with communist regimes. Those who fought in the former government are considered traitors, and as such, they MUST be re-educated along communist dogma---before they are allowed to fit into the new social order of the now reunified country.

The viewer sees the plight of the father as he endures years of imprisonment in the re-education camps, while at the same time, we see the emotional strain this is causing on the rest of the family. Grandmother is excellently cast in her role, as she recounts legendary tales to the young grandchild Lai. Amidst all of the emotional pain the family is going through now that the father is separated from them, is the ever present thought of escape to America. When the family decides the time is right for escape, they encounter a very perilous journey. The director did a very good job with the set designs in the open seas, as you can sense the claustrophobic feeling of the families who are attempting to escape Vietnam in a small fishing boat. Moreover, there is the ever present danger of pirates who prey on the open seas: And this is vividly portrayed in the film.

When the family eventually arrives in America, they encounter the usual hostility newcomers often face. Further, the director shows in both subtle, and not so subtle ways the discrimination that befalls the newcomers in their new home--especially those of the young boy Lai. However, there is more to the film than the families escape to America. We see the constant perils of those who are in the re-education camps and their hopes of finally gaining freedom. For while the director shows those who have finally found freedom, he also gives us a glimpse of many others who are still in the re-education camps who firmly believe and hope that they will one day be released, or will release themselves through bribery or escape from the camps. Will the father finally find freedom? I don't wish to divulge too much in this review, as there are some very important parts of the film I did not explore, which will only ruin the film for you. I recommend the film highly. For a more in-depth review, I recommend viewers take a look at the reviewer Woopak's review. He has given an outstanding review of the film.

2917223,5,B000U788WU,"I had to wait for the DVD to be released on October 30th, but it arrived 3 days later. Not too shabby.
My Vietnamese wife wanted to watch it immediately. As the movie progressed, I found it moving and very well made. The portions that use time-shifting require that you pay attention. My wife (from Can Tho) pointed out many instances where the story closely resembled the way her family members had left Vietnam or their experiences in the ""re-education"" camps. There was even a part where the North Vietnamese camp commander complains that he was mislead about his relatives poverty living in South Vietnam only to find during his first visit that they actually were better off than he was. The same story was related to me exactly years ago by a co-worker (also from Can Tho) who had spent time in a re-education camp. I have seen some a couple of the actresses in the equally moving ""3 Seasons (Ba Mua)"" and the cast of this movie is wonderful. I don't want to mention how the story pans out. I think you have to see it and get a sense of what people went through and are currently going through. Have your box of Kleenexes nearby. If you like this movie, also try ""Beautiful Country"" and ""3 Seasons"", which are also well-made, moving and informative movies.",1194134400,7,1262,4.5394736842105265
