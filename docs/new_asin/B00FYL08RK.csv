6038978,2,B00FYL08RK,"The 1970s aesthetic (quoted from the synopsis) this film attempts to produce takes some getting use to.

At first I thought the director may have been trying to use the screen-door effect as a historical time element (looking through a screen door = past) but this is evident, off and on, throughout the entire film. Are the constant amateur attempts to keep the cameras focused also part of the aesthetic? In one of the first opening scenes, the main character, Birch (Chris Graham All That Glitters - 2010 (demo reel of his 2013 films on imdb, check it out!)) is seen cutting leather (as we find out later, in order to make sandals) but the camera continually loses focus jumping from close-up of the leather to close-up of his hands, arms, etc. It is very distracting, even annoying, at the beginning of a movie.

Putting aside these production items, this is a story about a man who lives with an older man in a log cabin located somewhere in the Catskills. During the opening we see kids playing with a young, bearded man. Fast forward to the preset and we see Birch taking care of a man old enough to be his father who is sick and dying. We also briefly see an equally older woman taking care of the older man. We then see Birch setting up the older mans gravestone and thanking him with a toast of bottle of booze and a shot glass.

Birch has clothes out of Little House on the Prairie; a cleanly, well-dressed, suspendered and bearded mountain-man but when you observe him walking, it appears as if he has spent all of 5 minutes in the mountain as he carefully steps over branches and rocks, avoiding all obstacles.

We then see him being intimate (not sexual) with a young woman named Stacy (Sara Jecko) who seriously over-acts. It is not revealed if she is his girlfriend or wife but there is definite love between them. There is very loud back-woods folk guitar music playing that makes it extremely difficult to hear what the couple says to each other. Although this music continues throughout the opening scenes, fortunately it eventually fades so we can hear the main characters. I don't think it needed to be as loud to prove a point. In fact, shortly thereafter Birch asks Kyle (played by Jeremy Neal) to turn it off so they can hear each other talk.

Cut to New York where we meet 2 young men, 1 (Andrew, played by Andrew Glaszek) an obvious gym bunny and his boyfriend Kyle who is just a bunny (read: flamboyant, bitchy, rude and just as annoying as the loud music) twink who has pierced nips and a rabbit wrapped in some kind of crocheted blanket. We never find out why he is so attached to the rabbit but it is symbolic as revealed later in the film. They have a mutual female friend who plays the girlfriend part to a T with extreme over-acting. It appears that Kyle is just as much attached to her as he is to his cellphone and rabbit. They keep him too busy to really discover who he is or what he wants out of life.

As the 2 NY guys drive along in the car, the camera scans, not the countryside but the sky and when they pass trees, the camera again blurs. Is this 1970s aesthetic or just plain bad photography?

All characters were very careful to recite the horrible script word for word. The only emotion was obviously faked. It was very difficult for me to retain interest in the first 40 minutes.

We come to find out that Andrew is the son of the man who Birch has been living with and that Birch and Andrew use to be boyhood friends. Andrew had a crush on Birch in high school. Birch left the city life and loves his connection with all things nature, fishing, hunting, drinking, getting together with like-minded country neighbors, urinating outside and swimming nude. When Andrew finally tells him about how he has always felt toward Birch, Birch reminds Andrew that he already has a boyfriend (Kyle). Andrew attempts to find out how Birch feels but Birch does not believe in labeling (gay, straight, etc.) love. Kyle thinks Birch is hot but also thinks Birch killed Andrews father.

Then there is this big outdoor mountain party with all sorts of down-home mountain characters drinking and smoking dope and 1 woman (May, played by Glenda Lauten) who does a puppet play about Andrew coming out to his father and the argument that ensued between them. The only way she could have known about that is if Birch told her so Andrew fights with Birch. Well, as we all know, 2 guys fighting together is one of the best ways for males to become friends and bond so in a future scene, after they drink a bottle of Harveys Wonder Tonic we see the two wearing antlers on their heads with leaf necklaces tied around their necks, frolicking in the woods and bushes. After some talk, Birch has a very brief frontal nude urination scene and then he strips and jumps nude in the lake and convinces Andrew to follow (in his boxers). The picture on the main page here that you see of them lying in the field is taken after the swim and they are both nude (rear only). There is also rear nudity when Andrew and Kyle made very tender love earlier in the film. Unfortunately, the scene with Birch listening from the next room as they did so, was accompanied by disgustingly-fake sexual vocalizations that seriously degraded this film.

While Andrew and Birch were dancing with antlers on their heads, Kyle and May were drinking wine and smoking dope (irony that Kyle would make friends with the same woman that just reveled Andrews past to everyone!) and when Kyle started to sober up, realized that his boyfriend had stayed out all night and Kyle began to obsess. Evidently, the rabbit liked to stay outside as well. The rabbit and Andrew both liked the wild woods! So we see Kyle going off about loosing both of them. Another example of a way over-acted and very bad over-dramatized part, none of which was believable.

At about 1:23 of the 1:41 movie, it started to pixelate. I pulled out the DVD and saw no dirt or scratches (the DVD was in the original sealed case and the DVD was not loosed in shipment) but I did the standard cleaning thing anyway. Putting it back in and selecting the last scene, it still pixelated but cleared after a minute and a half running so I could watch the abrupt and rather unbelievable ending titled Resolution.

This resolution does clear up some previous questions the movie raised. It also presents a stark contrast between the perceived need for modern technology and the real need to be freed from old definitions of romantic love.",1392940800,2,6485,4.528608027327071

I am a simple, nice young christian male who just happened to want some instructional filmography on leather craft. Believe you me, if that's what you're looking for, this is not the film for you!

I am writing this review so none of you make the same mistake I did! This movie is not about leather craft at all! Its about hot steamy male-on-male gay sex! AAAHHHHH!",1390521600,7,449,4.345238095238095
6038981,4,B00FYL08RK,"Had it not been for Birch(the super masculine, sexy, hunk with the beautiful face, body, and feet) co-lead in this film, I would give it only 3 stars.

My copy was apparently poorly duplicated. The first 45 minutes the audio was irregular and there was a hazy, gray static over the picture ( i was tempted to return it), but could have just been the low-budget filmmaking. Except for Birch, the acting is either very poor or simply ""over"" acting as in the case of the queeny boyfriend. Having lived for years in the back woods of New Hampshire, I appreciated the remote setting and enjoyed the comical agony of the city-slicker's inability to get cell phone connections.

Birch and the development of the relationship between him and the son makes the film entertaining, sexy, and even romantic. Things do cum, I meant to say ""come"" together, in the end...and that's a good thing.

Leather was better than I expected though not a great film.  Sometimes, you simply want to be entertained with characters in which you can identify on some level. This film affords that opportunity for men who are attracted to men.

Be entertained. Birch, Birch, and Birch, again !",1388707200,13,1163,4.737623762376238

Most gay men want to see movies with loads of sex and pretty boys. Tho this movie has an extended sex scene you can fast forward thru it like I did. There are some big plot holes and the entire story is predictable but it's one of the better gay movies I've seen. Most gay men are shallow and seem to like shallow characters they can relate to. The characters in this story are grounded. They actually bring life to the picture. This is a thinking mans gay movie. if you are one of the shallow ones you'll hate it because it's too deep for you.

There is a mysterious wise, check forging, country sandal maker who prizes not defining himself or anyone else.  The sandal maker has also just ended his last relationship with a woman who is leaving the woods.  The son, of the not so dearly departed father, has many issues.  There is even a world wise, middle aged, independent female buddy puppeteer who adds to the psychological discussions of the movie.

The actors are better than the story, which is the problem.  If this was a horror film, the story would have had the ""kids"" making out, then killing them within a couple of minutes afterwards.

The lead actors are good looking.  The film looks professionally shot.  But, this has one dimensional people who start to ask questions, when ""Birch"", the sandal maker, brings out the moonshine.  Don't worry, be happy, seems to be his mantra.  It's written from an elite-rural perspective.  Where the rural folk are wise beyond their years, ok, that's fine.  But that the urban folk are, adrift, just waiting to realize the superiority of life away from it all... what?

The fact that most of the characters have some major character flaws, like theft, physical abuse control... and did I say theft?  There are just some things that are left open ended which makes me question being supportive of any of the characters.  At the end of this film, I felt like I had participated in a group therapy session, that included switching partners.

The people who have watched it seem pretty much to fall across a spectrum and, after having watched it, that doesn't surprise me.

Without (I hope) giving too much away, there's a rediscovered love story here that I found really compelling, and convincingly and beautifully acted.  Maybe it's for you, and maybe it isn't.  Maybe you should take a chance and find out which it is for you.

The histrionic flamer was not integrated well into the development. The main actors seemed not to be comfortable in their roles nor to have developed their own back story to enlighten themselves whom it was they were to portray.

The two main characters are REALLY hot esp. Birch. Too bad those two don't star in a porn film. The ending is retarded.  It just ends and you see this stupid rabbit name Mary Anne that the screaming queen brought for some odd reason. And there is the music which sounds like someone who knows the director.

It has some challenging aspects- the gay son and his BF get a little one note and too annoying to be consistently likable- my instinct is that it is not their acting ability but how they were directed as each has moments where they come across quite real and sympathetic- but much of the time it feels like someone off camera is saying ""bigger"" and pushing them into stereotyped behaviors- some of the fault might be the script which pushes a simplistic comparison in the country vs city argument... but ultimately I enjoyed the film and it stuck with me for a day or two. I am glad I did not turn it off in the first 20 minutes which I was tempted to do. The fellow who plays the lead (with the beard) has a nice enigmatic screen presence and in many ways he is what makes the film more than just an escape to a simpler life fantasy.",1444176000,4,865,4.216867469879518

6039277,1,B00FYL08RK,"Bad. Really bad and that brings me no joy. I am a huge fan of gay romance. This is not the worst I've seen. But it's in the top 3.

First there's the screenplay. I plays to all the typical gay character stereotypes and the usual situations. Here's what you have:  A bearded mountain man whose vocabulary seems limited. A gay couple from the city who come to the Catskills on family business. A drunken neighbor woman. (Why she is even in this I don't know.) One half of the gay couple is younger and slightly effeminate. He travels with a pet bunny (not a typo). There's a dog and a home puppet show about gay sex. You can NOT make this up. Was the writer inebriated when they came up with this.

It's got a terrible ending. The older half of the couple stays out all night with the beard and they have sex in the woods while wearing pine one necklaces. It's just ridiculous.  Then when the younger guy finds out his partner has cheated with the beard and he's being dumped, he heads back to NYC. But not before he has a 3 way group hug with the now ex-boyfriend and the creep who stole him. Really? Not in my world.

Then there's the acting. Oh they have their moments. But' it's mostly lacking in energy or power. Maybe they were as bored doing this as I was watching it.  Go watch Oh Happy Day, Morgan or The 10 Year Plan. Now those are GOOD gay films.",1442102400,3,1355,4.1923076923076925

Don't get me wrong, the story was valid and is plausible, but the framer were so long, and it just seemed to go on and on, and never went where it should have. I would go one way, and drastically change to the complete opposite then you thought it would.
The acting was terrible, there were questions unanswered, and just horrible.
Now, don't get me wrong, it is an independent film, but even still... Independent films are typically stories that no one knows about like 'Shortbus' or even 'Dog Tags,' yet this blasphemy was just terrible! I have never wanted to actually return a movie so much in my life, and typically I like movies like this, that show realistic storylines or plots, but this is was ridiculous.
The worse part, is the face none of it fit right, it would involve different characters or aspects they could have played with, that they never touched, such as when Queen Bee finds the money and the gun, nothing comes of it...
And when it finally hits the sex scene, it feels like I'm watching a porno, not a movie, and then just bounces back to scenes that made no sense.

6039288,4,B00FYL08RK,"Leather, a strange 2013 gay flick made of fragments of interest and weirdnesses. It's not about the gay leather subculture, by the way. Available on YouTube.

Basics: After learning of the death of his estranged father, urban grad student Andrew arrives at the old family mountain cabin with his incredibly infantile larcenous and unstable queen of a boyfriend* and unexpectedly reconnects with childhood buddy Birch, who'd become dad's surrogate son in the decade-long interim. Drama
ensues.

*[As I often say, right-wing ""homophobes"" cannot come up with more repulsive stereotypes than gay-originated media. This pathetic excuse for a male is a tantrum-throwing infant who cares only about fashion and his pet rabbit, Mary Anne. Really. No kidding. What hunky Andrews sees in him...?]

SOME SPOILER INFO BELOW: if you plan to watch it, you may not want to continue reading.

""Leather"" is a combo family/boyhood-friend drama. It has antique hippie back-to-nature romanticism, plus contemporary LGBT dysfunction (and contemptible and wholly gratuitous knee-jerk politics). For all its oddness, bumps and wrong turns, the worthwhile center of the story portrays, IMHO, the redemption of a lost gay male through re-connection with the boyhood friend whom his redeemed father redeemed. He moves from a retarding ""gay"" relationship to a maturing erotic relationship with another man, outside the standard identity labels.

The two men, Andrew and Birch, are opposites in a variety of ways, which makes for conflict/attraction, of course. The dark furry earth man and the gingerblond smooth intellectual man. A classic pairing of chthonic and ouranic men, ground-dweller and sky-dweller, so well described by Graham Jackson in his 1991 book ""The Secret Lore of Gardening"" .

Both of them look very fine in their own way. Andrew Glaszek especially...who's also a decent actor with a boyish but very masculine energy. And they're even better together.",1412380800,5,1944,5.420529801324503

6039291,5,B00FYL08RK,"I rented this on Netflix, and immediately turned around and bought it from Amazon -- it was that good. When the disc arrived two days later, I watched it again and it was just as good the second time

A reviewer of an unrelated film wrote ""why can't US film makers give us a gay romance film in which romantic emotions and physical acts come across in such a way that we, the audience, can SEE and FEEL the passion....the tenderness....the closeness between two men?"" That's exactly what ""Leather"" does.

I'm having trouble getting specific about this movie without giving major spoilers, so for now I'll just say that the relationship between Birch and Andrew (Chris Graham and Andrew Glaszek) was improbable but believable as it was written and acted. The two main characters showed their emotions believably, and I was fully invested in the story. It doesn't hurt that the two are both quite attractive, but the movie is a lot deeper than the usual eye candy.

The third character, Kyle (Jeremy Neal) was just annoying as Andrew's boyfriend. Yes, such queeny characters do exist in real life, but I couldn't imagine why Andrew hadn't kicked him to the curb a long time ago, Early in Act II, when Andrew reassured Kyle that he loved him, at the time I asked ""why?"" and I don't think the movie ever answered that question. That's probably the one weak point in the movie, but it was a relatively brief one. Kyle himself is there, I think, to make a sharper contrast with the quiet depth of Birch.

There's lots of bare chests and some bare butts, and while they were nice to look at they didn't feel gratuitous, not there just for titillation. I don't remember any frontal nudity; at most there might have been a brief flash.",1407024000,31,1726,4.612377850162867
6039292,3,B00FYL08RK,"This film seems to be about the simple life of Birch.  The film itself should have been kept simple.

Their should have been just three characters in this film....Birch, Andrew and Copper, the dog.  Kyle and the rabbit were so annoying and such an unnecessary distraction.

Childhood friends dealing with their own friendship years later while dealing with the death of a father and the questions surrounding the friend's relationship with the father is more than enough for an excellent film.

I am unclear whether the actor play Kyle is an excellent actor or just the opposite.  The character sure was hysterical and over dramatic  and so annoying.  His presence, both the character and the actor lessened my enjoyment of this film too much.

The only redeeming aspects of this movie is where the two friends (who have not seen each other in ten years) get the chance to be naked and make love (course the blonde is cheating on his boyfriend).  And the burly bear isn't really gay he is just a sexual person while the blonde drops his boyfriend to be with the burly bear (whose name is Birch).  They end the movie up with the two of them in bed as Birch is sending his Girlfriend who went to NYC a letter saying he misses her.

6039294,2,B00FYL08RK,"The fast forward is broken on my remote, otherwise I would have used it many times to get through the extremely hokey dialogue and plot situations.  Very little rang true in this film as every character seemed built on a cliche.  Too much time was wasted on setting up the father's death in  ""precious"" background scenes.  Much too often the various characters were drunk to no real purpose---or at least seemed to be drunk.  And what was  with the radical fairy--like woodland romp?  Puppet shows?  Filler, filler, filler.  And beaver milk cheese?---I couldn't see any city slicker being that far out of it.  Some reviewers lay the blame on the actors.

6039299,3,B00FYL08RK,"I've given this film three stars (it's Ok) as the film is borderline ok. The one redeeming feature of the film is the plot. It is a very good story and in the hands of the right director/producer/actors it could be a hit. Unfortunately none of these apply to this production. The plot is outlined in great detail by another reviewer as are the flaws - a review with which I concur wholeheartedly.

I don't know who these actors are and I hope it is their first tentative steps into the world of acting. If not I suggest they try another profession because they are never going to convince anyone they can act. I have no idea how the boyfriend with the rabbit ever got chosen for this role. He seriously cannot act and I doubt that he got the role after a long and rigorous auditioning. I assume he owned the camera or gave some funding but anyone off the street could have acted better - or in this case just read the words off the page.

The two main actors around which the story is set are less wooden as their arms and legs move but they still are not really carrying the film. You can see them 'act'.

The story seriously misses a sub-plot. As there is only one story the three actors have to try carry it and us along. They fail to do that and a little bit of distraction would have been welcome. I thought we learned too little about the father and a subplot could have been a woman who was in love with him and who reveals his past in flashbacks. Anything really to lighten the mood. The nearest the film came to breaking through was the puppeteer. She was good - if not the best actress (if indeed she was as actress) but she added much needed breaks to the other three. The problem however was that her puppet therapy pieces in the film do not go on long enough to warrant the reactions they get from the actors. They should have been longer and possibly a lot more subtle. Just having puppets blurt out bluntly that your father hated you and dumped you out of the house 10 years ago doesn't leave much to the imagination.

Birch was passable as an actor but seemed just too relaxed considering he was going to be turfed out of his house. He was also writing dodgy cheques using the father's forged signature. That isn't addressed in the plot. Although the credits list a 'leather work advisor' it would appear that making a pair of sandals in a couple of minutes is the norm. I suspect at least a day or two would be the norm. I know it has to be condensed for the film but leather work is time consuming and smells. That was ignored.

Overall the plot was strong and was worth watching just for that. The acting was terrible with not one experienced or strong actor to carry the film. It needed a sub-plot to tell us more back story about the father and his relationship with Birch who managed to remain immaculately dressed in the middle of a forest or in a workshop by the way. Watch it if you get the opportunity and hopefully someone will buy the script and re shoot the film.",1395705600,2,2992,4.279151943462898
6039300,5,B00FYL08RK,"I read the previous reviews on this site, and I had a problem not hearing all of the conversation where it was obvious from moving lips that something was being said.  It was corrected with advice from the director--nothing to do with the DVD but my DVD player.  Now my copy is problem free.

I have owned the movie for about three weeks and have watched it several times--nothing is more intimate or personal for me than the scene in the woods after Andrew completes his piece about Herman Melville.  The natural lifestyle of Birch versus the superficial one of Andrew in the city is very poignant.  Yet Andrew seems to be longing for what Birch has despite Andrew's previous attempt to not have anything to do with his earlier life in the Catskills or even worse, Walter, his father, who did not accept Andrew as his gay son.  One does have to wonder what Walter thought or knew of Birch's life, if Birch ever revealed anything.  Again Birch's down to earth personality comes through in the last leather workshop scene.  Andrew so much wants to reconnect with Birch, but Birch's honesty about Andrew's commitment to Kyle, the flamboyant boyfriend, shows the maturity of someone who has had to live more independently in the woods.

If Patrick McGuinn produced a sequel to this movie or produced another one with Chris Graham (Birch), I would be the first in line to purchase it.  He is such an adorable man.

Thanks again Patrick for this movie.",1393804800,4,1447,4.65748031496063
