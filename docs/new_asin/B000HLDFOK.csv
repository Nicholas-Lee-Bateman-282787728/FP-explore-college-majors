8325196,4,B000HLDFOK,"OK, I agree with the previous review in terms of the quality of the video BUT I have been searching for this video for over 2 months!  We found it On Demand and I did not pay attention to who it was made by.  My son, started watching the video when he was 16 months and was facinated by it.  Then On Demand no longer had it! But I had to search for it because when you ask my son, who has not seen the video for over 2 months, how old he is, he says: uno, uno, uno! He still remembers this particular counting video.  You never know what your child will like, mine like this song and the dancing robot in it.  I recommend renting it from Netflix first. I already know I have to get it.",1288742400,,685,3.8992805755395685
8325197,1,B000HLDFOK,"We bought this DVD when our son was about to be born, and wow, it stinks. The songs and video quality look like we could've done this at home, and there's nothing in here that's better to learn Spanish than parents going over the numbers with kids on their own with a little song made up for them. We pretty much felt this way about all five DVDs we bought. They all just severely underestimate how quality video production and QUALITY songs (and singing) would go a long way towards making the learning more enjoyable.",1262822400,,519,4.473684210526316
