8419985,4,B004AC6PVC,"Midnight Meat Train remains a classic.  It was my first introduction to Vinnie Jones and I was impressed by his performance.  Because Books of Blood is a bit restrained compared to the original source material, it is less than perfect.  I still enjoyed it quite a bit and find that owning this disk is worth while.",1487376000,,314,4.571428571428571

8419988,2,B004AC6PVC,"BOOK OF BLOOD: As a fan of Clive Barker, I somehow expected more/better. I was confused by most of this movie. A man somehow turns into a canvas for the stories of the dead who in their untold numbers have lots to tell. However, the stories being carved into the man's skin seem to be in a sort of short-hand but you never see the carver nor get any explanation of the symbols. Perhaps I'm slow or just suffering from a failure to understand, but it was strange. Was that the point? If this had not been paired with the other DVD, I would not have bought it. The 2 star rating was for Bradley Cooper in the other DVD in the pack. As far as I'm concerned, don't bother with Book of Blood.

MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN: This movie starts with Bradley Cooper trying to get recognized as a professional photographer. He seems to have the talent and only needs to get the right shots to be included in a show. Enter Brook Shields in a strange throw-away role. Bradley is out one night way too late when he sees some thugs about to rape a world famous model, although oddly he doesn't know who she is. He intervenes. He later sees in the paper that she disappeared, so he thinks she disappeared off the train. He begins to stalk the train and begins to follow the dark man played by Vinnie Jones in a typical role for him. Vinnie works in a slaughter house, so Bradley thinks Vinnie is killing people and adding their meat into the slaughter house meat. Bradley sets out to prove his theory. Vinnie rides the ""night train to nowhere"" and walks up the train with ""Thor's hammer"" in a leather bag, stopping for lone passengers so he can swat them in the back of their head hard enough to make their eyeballs pop out. Then the story becomes convoluted involving Bradley's girlfriend, the police and some kind of mutants, but that is never clear either. Then everyone gets killed and for no good reason, Bradley takes the place of the dark man and will use the hammer to kill train passengers to feed the mutants. Clear as mud you say? What ever possessed Bradley Cooper to make a movie like this? $$$ would be my guess!",1423094400,,2102,4.362244897959184
8419989,4,B004AC6PVC,"I will say, both movies didn't follow Clive Barkers book to the exact letters, however they aren't bad either. I read the book first before watching both and I was a bit dissapointed at the Book of Blood. The Midnight Meat Train hit closer to home than the Book of Blood.
Midnight Meat Train is one of my favorite horror movies with how grotesque it is, but Book of Blood fails to deliver the tension like the other movie. Both were not directed by Clive Barker so I would imagine that makes a bit of a diffrence. So, above mediocre but it won't blow you away. Good set of Halloween movies to watch once or twice a year.",1413849600,,620,4.262711864406779
8419990,5,B004AC6PVC,"WOW!!!  Awesome movies!  I think these are two of the best movies I've ever seen that can really ""scare"" you.  I love getting scared and I never get the chance to see two in a row.  These were great and if you love scary movies, this will be right up your alley.",1376956800,2,262,3.980769230769231
8419991,4,B004AC6PVC,I bought this for Midnight Meat Train. Its a great sick little flick. they transfer is great and the fact that these movies come on 2 separate Blu ray disks is a plus ( I didn't know that when I bought it ) I watched Book of Blood as well it was good but I liked the Meat Train better (that sounds bad),1367020800,,302,3.8095238095238093
8419992,4,B004AC6PVC,"Ok, I'll level with you. These are not great movies. What they are is very enjoyable twisted tales from the mind of Clive Barker. MMT (Midnight Meat Train) is the better of the two, with surprisingly good acting and a very interesting plot. It gets stuck in its own confusion of what it is, though. It spends an awful lot of time on the inner-workings of the main character, which provides some good payoff in the end. It does slow the action down quite bit.

Book of Blood is almost the inverse. It jumps from spooky action to spooky action, without much thought to character development.

The Blu-Rays are sharp, the special features leave something to be desired. The brightest side is that you are getting 2 high quality horror flicks for $10 on Blu. They are enjoyable and re-watchable. Take that chance and pick them up!",1299196800,4,826,4.612244897959184
