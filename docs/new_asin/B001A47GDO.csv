3445590,5,B001A47GDO,"I have been looking for older masterpieces to keep.  This is indeed a Masterpiece.  If you are in America and locked into the stupid DVD restrictive area coding, you could look for a program called Handbrake. Strictly speaking it is an encoder, but one of its virtues is, it will rip any DVD.  Once ripped, the DVD will play on any computer irrespective of area.  Better still buy Air Video (1.99 in the UK) from the App Store and then you can watch the DVD on your iPad.

Private Schultz is good enough to justify doing this for it alone.",1326067200,6,539,4.35
3445591,5,B001A47GDO,"After not seeing this a second time since it originally aired oh so many years ago, I can still reduce a friend of mine to stitches when I attribute some colossal failure of technology or bureaucracy to ""ze Technical Section of ze SS"", a line lifted straight from the series. It's also noted for featuring one Rula Lenska, the flame haired star of the British stage. And, the ending is inspired.

Please, someone, get your head out and release this for the US market!!",1307232000,7,468,4.571428571428571
3445592,5,B001A47GDO,I watched this excellent series almost 40 years ago and never forgot it. It is one of the cleverest and funniest series I've ever seen. Masterpiece Theater should air it again.,1298851200,2,176,4.709677419354839
3445593,5,B001A47GDO,How funny is this?  Well I still remember it and still want it some 28 years later!,1280361600,4,83,3.8823529411764706
3445594,5,B001A47GDO,"Back in 1982, 1983 I had just purchased a VCR (for $500.00 U.S Dollars!!!) and one of the very first things I recorded on tape (besides Monty Python on PBS) was the 6 episodes of Private Schulz.....which I'd re-watch over and over every few years. Well, one day back in the '90's, I lent it out to someone and it was never returned. I miss watching this excellent Masterpiece Theatre presentation.....the stars of it were so great (one of Ian Richardson's finest outings)  and the writing was so dark and funny....especially the final episode, which sees Ian R. playing another role (maybe 2?) and I am SO sad that this can not be found here in the U. S. and A.
PLEASE!!!!!!!!! Somebody release this here in the states! It is one of the most wonderful Masterpiece productions, alongside ""Therese Raquin"" made around the same time.
Thanks for reading my first, and most likely, only review here on Amazon.",1273449600,6,904,4.685534591194968
3445595,5,B001A47GDO,"I remember loving this very clever, wickedly funny and surprisingly endearing mini-series when it first aired on PBS - and have been waiting v-e-r-y patiently ever since for it to be made available to the home viewer.  That it continues to be essentially a ""lost"" show to American audiences is a travesty.  Ian Richardson's tour de force performance(s)alone (shades of Alec Guinness) make it well worth the viewing!",1269907200,5,415,5.088235294117647
3445596,5,B001A47GDO,"I remember absolutely screaming with laughter at Ian Richardson's performance when this was first broadcast on PBS 28 years ago, and have been searching for it ever since.  Hilarious, sophisticated,  brilliant-- the best of everything in British entertainment- the writing, acting- everything an Anglophile appreciates from our British brethren.  A classic, worthy of re-issue.  See it if you haven't yet- you'll be rewarded.",1266883200,14,425,5.698412698412699
3445597,5,B001A47GDO,"It seems a scant few American viewers, myself included obviously, remember seeing this air on PBS in the states back in '82. My god, Alastair Cooke was still hosting! Despite it being that long ago, I never, ever forgot this series. It was simply one of the funniest and most intelligent black comedies ever produced, plus you got a history lesson with laughter. The acting was excellent, the writing not only didn't insult your intelligence but COMPLIMENTED it, it's fast paced, engaging....what more do you need to make an NTSC US version of this? It would at least be a cult seller if not a rediscovered classic. It would be watched more now than it was then.

  This is also the first and ONLY comedy from one of the writers of I, Claudius & some other legendary Masterpiece Theatre classics (I believe I heard that. Correct me if I'm wrong). It works so well as a comedy, I think he should have produced others. It's not stuffy whatsoever. In fact, it reminded me of a black humored punk rock comedy like Repo Man crossed with something like post-Python Fawlty Towers.

Private Schulz is indeed private: a private treasure if you've seen it. And that's tradgedy, not comedy.

EDIT: Order the region 2 version and have it ""converted"" with HandBrake. Face it, it's the only way we're gonna get it in the U.S.",1266537600,22,1311,4.633620689655173
3445598,5,B001A47GDO,"I remember seeing this on the PBS series ""Masterpiece Theater"".  It was very clever and quite funny. In my opinion, it was better quality writing than you see coming from much of the British imports today. It would be a welcome addition to the U.S. market and frankly, I do not understand why it has been overlooked. I believe most fans of British humor would love discovering this gem.",1263686400,21,386,4.594202898550725
8275967,4,B001A47GDO,"Very funny fiction about an actual event in World War II.  Kind of a British Hogan's Heroes, with less slapstick.  I found it very entertaining.  Too bad the Beeb doesn't make this and others like it region-free, so more people could enjoy them.",1505952000,,245,4.651162790697675
8275968,5,B001A47GDO,Great dark humor against a background of interesting historical World War II facts.,1428364800,,83,5.461538461538462
8275969,5,B001A47GDO,"This is an excellent 6 part story. Based on the real life WWII event of Operation Bernhard where Germany planned to flood Britain with forged five pound notes, this story makes the most of that while spinning a great fictional story around the factual foundation.

Micheal Elphick and Ian Richardson are perfect for the roles they are in. It goes beyond the great writing of Jack Pulman, Elphick and Richardson literally bring their characters to life and they play off each other perfectly. Elphick as Private Schulz is the ultimate born loser and he always loses out in the end. Richardson as Major Neuheim is the man that causes most of the losses for Shultz during the war although he ultimately loses in the end as well. Ian Richardson also plays 3 other roles in the 6 part series.

Although listed as a comedy, it is much more. Serious subjects are treated with respect. You can literally feel the fear in Solly towards the end as he worries about his fate as well as the fate of his fellow prisoners when the forging operation is being disbanded. I would list it more as a light drama given how they handle more serious subjects.

Unfortunately this isn't available as a Region 1 DVD, only as a Region 2+4. It is well worth getting a region free DVD player just to play this DVD even if it is the only non-Region 1 DVD you ever get.",1426636800,,1340,4.483606557377049

8275972,5,B001A47GDO,"An extremely funny take on a real secret forgery operation in the Sachsenhausen Concentration camp during WWII.  The basic story is quite accurately portrayed but hilarious additions make for one of the funniest series I have seen on television.  Michael Elphick, Billie Whitelaw and (Sir) Ian Richardson lead an excellent cast at the top of their form. For a more serious and accurate telling of the same story see ""The Counterfeiters"" (2009).",1413504000,,444,5.152777777777778
8275973,5,B001A47GDO,On time and as advertised.,1405814400,,26,4.4
8275974,5,B001A47GDO,"This is as funny as the other reviews have stated.  Ian Richardson shows his acting range by playing three different parts in the series, all different and hilarious.  Michael Elphick is perfect as the unsuccessful con-man title character.  I downloaded the VLC Player (free) which recognizes most formats, including region 2/4.  Add a $5 VGA cable from your laptop to your TV and you're in business.",1397347200,,400,5.015151515151516
8275975,5,B001A47GDO,"This DVD, ""Private Schulz"", sold by DaaVeeDee via Amazon.com cannot be viewed in Ontario, Canada because it is in the 'wrong region', whatever that means.  This is most frustrating since the item was bought and presented as a birthday gift (bought March 14; given as gift May 4, 2013).  Information to the effect that this item was not viewable in Canada would have alerted me to this and enabled me not to order it.",1367625600,,416,4.608108108108108
8275976,4,B001A47GDO,"Especially Ian Richardson this comedy was
well acted and later years more appreciated.
The producers no doubt wanted to have screened
as much of the actual events of what did occur
during WWII in the copying of the British money.",1347408000,,229,4.75
