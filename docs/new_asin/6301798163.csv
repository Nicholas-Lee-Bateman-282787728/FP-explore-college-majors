About a quarter of the footage had been removed, and some critical events occurred out of sequence...basically a mixed-up mess.",1477612800,,285,4.72

7815566,4,6301798163,"This is a unique and gripping wartime drama, set in Yugoslavia during the final months of the German occupation at the end of World War Two. It was filmed on location in Yugoslavia, and most of the actors (other than the stars) are Yugoslavian; this gives the film authenticity, since the adult actors would have grown up with stories from parents, telling about the German occupation. The movie focuses on a lifeguard at a summer lake resort. German troops occupy the nearby town, but they are preparing to retreat soon back to Germany. The Yugoslav lifeguard rescues and resuscitates a middle-aged near-death drowning victim, who survives. But the victim turns out to be a high-ranking German S.S. officer. The Germans hold an award ceremony for the lifeguard, who is then given a medal for saving the life of the S.S. officer. The award is reported, with photos, in the local newspaper. The lifeguard then becomes an outcast in his own community, labeled as an enemy collaborator. His neighbors ostracize him, yet he had no prior knowledge of the victim's identity at the time when he saved the victim. No other war movie has developed this theme in the way this drama does. I am puzzled, though, whether ""white roses"" has a symbolic meaning. Nowhere in the movie were white roses mentioned or shown. Perhaps ""white roses"" denotes treason or disloyalty??
