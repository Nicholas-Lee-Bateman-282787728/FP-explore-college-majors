8255750,5,B0014IC302,"Now this one I loved! The plot was good. The actors were good, and lots of insects crunching on people! My kind of movie! Will watch this one again.",1404432000,,148,4.137931034482759
8255751,4,B0014IC302,"Pretty good movie. Lots of action and well constructed CGI Bugs.
The evolution aspect was unbelievable from Scorpians to Mosquitoes.
Lots of guns and escapes. Enjoyed this movie and will watch again soon.
Waited for an affordable copy. Finally found one. Thanks Amazon/SciFi",1264464000,,274,5.395348837209302
8255752,4,B0014IC302,The bugs in this movie are very impressive.  They look pretty real and they get plenty of screen time.  The acting is good and there is plenty of action and gore to satisfy someone looking for a creature movie like this.,1240790400,7,220,4.341463414634147
8255753,3,B0014IC302,"As the title of this review states - this is a giant bug movie. And, while I agree with the previous reviewer that it could have been better, the same can be said about most giant bug movies.

This movie delivers what this genre should - a gorgeous heroine, a dashing hero, a valiant and sympathetic secondary cast, a defintely evil villan, and some quite good (considering the probable budget constraints) giant bugs.

Angie Everhart does surprisingly well as the ""babe entomologist"", though everyone comes in a distant second to Mira Sorvino in ""Mimic"". :-)  Antonio Sabato Jr. has the look for the dashing hero, and the rest of the cast was, well..... well cast. The overall cast contains, if not Oscar contenders, a plethora of solid actors with lengthy resumes, and they do a professional job.

If you have a soft spot for giant bug movies, like I do, then you'll probably enjoy this movie. It's overall pretty well done, so pop some popcorn, put the little ones to bed - it's a bit gory in spots - and enjoy. If you're looking for the next ""Them"" or ""Mimic"", you might be dissapointed, but I think not terribly so.",1214092800,14,1120,4.585
8255754,3,B0014IC302,"Bugs originally aired several years back on Sci-fi Channel (back when they offered some watchable films ... too bad they lost the formula). Is it great? No. But it is meaningless fun. Bugs has pretty good special effects which helps offset a poorly re-written script (there had to have been a better, more intelligent script than what was offered given the
overall effort of the film). Another Sci-fi movie that is OK to watch,
but just Bugs you they didn't go to the extra effort to make better ...
it had potential to be better.",1211673600,6,530,4.589473684210526
