1648656,4,B00005QIVO,A very entertaining movie.  It will appeal to the girls and the gay boys out there.  The movie is very well done.  The acting and directing are good as well.  Great looking guys.,1004486400,3,178,4.303030303030303
1648657,5,B00005QIVO,"I love this movie. It centers around one of my favorite subjects...the dark side. Here, some blood suckers have a fraternity where unsuspecting college freshman, Chris, is their next recruit. But he doesn't expect what's coming up. It is a great movie and I've watched it many times. I love it and I greatly recommend it. If u like vampires and things of that sort you will like this movie. And another thing...Devon is hottt!!!!!(and in case u didn't know he's the ""head honcho"" of the blood brothers)",1003708800,7,502,4.715909090909091
1648660,5,B00005QIVO,Great movie recieved before the date was told. I will recommend this movie to family and friends. Will be ordering the rest of collection.,1361404800,,138,4.791666666666667
1648661,2,B00005QIVO,I DID NOT THINK THAT THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE KIND OF INTERSTING TO SAY THE LEAST. MEN IN UNDERWEAR AT THE END NOT SO GREAT.,1355356800,,122,3.730769230769231
1648662,1,B00005QIVO,"Would not play pass the first 5 minutes, it sucked!  Seem to be a good movie and was interesting, if only it would play.",1351036800,,120,4.0
1648663,1,B00005QIVO,"Well.  I bought this movie along with its ""sequels"" (I use the word ""sequels"" in its loosest context) believing that the storyline as described sounded intriguing, a little mystical, a little horror-thriller-scary, and good entertainment.  My opinion?  Don't waste your time if you're seeking any in-depth plots or *any* mystical-horror-thriller-suspense experiences.  I actually sat through it, intently waiting for it to get better.  It didn't.  I sat through the second movie thinking it couldn't be any worse than the first and I was dead wrong.  I turned the third one off about twenty minutes into it (that over-the-top sword-wielding dude replete with covered head and face -- Darth Vader meets Michael Jackson -- decked out in black with glittering adornments had me rolling my eyes).  The fourth was the most interesting plot-wise as far as I watched it, but I didn't finish watching it before passing the whole 4-DVD series on to my 21-year old niece.

Why did I pass it on to her?  Because of the series' all-pervasive theme of showcasing young male bodies clad in boxer briefs accompanied by swelling music during the many close-ups.  There were some shows of excess testosterone, some shows of weird male bonding, some shows of over-sensitive types screwing with the works, and a great deal of head-tripping follow-the-leader games.  Idiocy in abundance.

And the write-up on the back of the first movie's box says this became a cult favorite.  I'd absolutely *love* to know who in his/her right mind would enjoy this ridiculous series.

By all means, buy this movie and its sequels if you're into yawning through nonsense while waiting for the music to swell and the clothes to come off ... there's lots of rippling muscles and caressing by the camera of body lengths to see if that's your thing.

This series is supposed to contain some sort of gay connotation?  *Where?*  None of the guys moved on each other, only some half-witted groping of a few idiot women.

I think I'm too old for such ... ummm ... silliness.  I'm *waaaaaayyy* past the age of 12 ... and even 21! ;-P",1181520000,3,2089,4.880681818181818
1648664,4,B00005QIVO,"Don't waste any time thinking where is the horror in that flick, fellas.

The story of that low, 'low' budget movie is an excuse for delivering underwear homoerotic scenes of some of the most hot young males that the director could find when it shooted the movie.

So, if you like any of this like i do, apart from expend a very entertaining corny one and a half hour of your life, there's a great chance that you really enjoy it.

Personally, as an horror movies fan, i think that it's time to center the erotic interest of that movies in the males, after passing more than twenty years worshiping the body of women.

Apparently, there's a lot of people agreeing with me. As an example, take a look at THE COVENANT, one major studio horror flick that is nothing more that a David Decoteau movie, but with a real 'budget' attached to it

After all, yes; the movie is cheap. But the dvd's also.

If you like it, don't miss from the same director: THE BROTHERHOOD: YOUNG WARLOCKS, SPEED DEMON, LEECHES, VOODOO ACADEMY AND BEASTLY BOYZ.",1173571200,10,1033,4.497326203208556
1648665,3,B00005QIVO,"I kind of like how the story revolves on the main character getting into this secret society.  Although at first he's not feeling the whole idea at first.  But given some coersion from his roommate and another person.  He decides to attend and the story basically goes from there.  I would like to know though why they couldn't afford a real axe.  Because i couldn't help but laugh at the dude carrying it the first.  It was shown in the movie (i know its not a big deal).  But if i notice it, i'm sure others did as well. Overall the characters were decent and it kept me interested for most of the movie.  It's not too long around an hour and 20 minutes (give or take a few).  I would rent/borrow it first before putting down the cash just so you can know what your getting into.  Hopefully the next movie ramps it up a notch.",1165449600,5,828,4.2165605095541405
1648666,3,B00005QIVO,"This movie was really good in that several antagonisms were threaded throughout a decent story: geek vs jock, classism vs deceny, jealousy, friendship , etc , etc. Why the director just HAS to announce his gayness in his films is pointless. There was absolutely no reason for everyone to be running around in only their drawers, except for Mr DeCourteou to let us know of his sexual preference. It added absolutely nothing to the story. He could have invited the actors over to his house and paid them to strip. It would have had the same amount of relevance to this movie. The fight scenes could have been better. The movie, as a whole though is quite good. I still think this directors best film is ""Final Stab"", but this is a close second. Some of the acting, specifically the fraternity king, could have been better, but it passed. This is definatley a keeper. I also like the fact that not too much attention was given to the vampire aspect, instead of the interpersonal relationships. There wasn't a lot of fangs and gore, but just enough to satisfy us horror buffs.",1162857600,5,1072,4.617801047120419
1648667,5,B00005QIVO,"its low budget, so you cant expect much from it anyway.

i found it very entertaining and already bought it. plus it's homoerotic so that's a plus lol

worth buying.",1162080000,7,165,4.466666666666667
1648668,1,B00005QIVO,"umm...I dunno...something to do with frat brothers? It got so boring I started skipping through scenes hoping to get to a good part but that part never came.

I just have to say this: didn't they have enough money for a REAL ax? Really...they're not that expensive.

This movie was too bad to even laugh at. It was boring.",1158796800,9,322,4.440677966101695
1648669,4,B00005QIVO,"I so enjoyed this movie. A good story, nice spooky atmosphere, great looking guys, nice spin on the vampire genre.",1158192000,,114,4.75
1648670,4,B00005QIVO,"Loved it, terrible movie at it's core, but very appealing visually.  Shot well, funny, and slick.  As a fan of the horror genre (I'm of the Halloween and Friday the 13th generation) I'm used to seeing the girls in bikini/underwear/nothing for eyecandy.  This one finally gives the boys a turn, with the male lead jogging shirtless, bending and stretching in long camera shots, and showing off his nice assets.  The head vampire, who obviously adores him, is a hottie as well, and loves to hang out in his underwear with all his friends.  Recommended for a lonely Friday night.",1111017600,6,576,4.777777777777778
1648671,5,B00005QIVO,"I rented this movie thinking it was about vampires, I come to find out that its not but a play off vampires and how vampires are a myth they are the reality. Very beautiful guys actors along with one really annoying girl actress makes this movie worthwhile i recommend it to anyone looking for a short thrill you will be very pleased.",1076198400,5,334,4.403225806451613
1648672,2,B00005QIVO,"Okay, this is obviously a movie meant to turn on the guys...if you're in to hunky young flesh, this one's for you.  There's some studly looking dudes in this one.  However, other than Nathan Watkins as Chris and Josh Hammond as his buddy, the rest of the acting is junior high level.  Especially Bradley Stryker, the hunk who plays head guy Devon.  Elizabeth Bruderman is simply awful as the female lead, a whiny voice delivering lines like she was a recorded answering machine voice.  Direct David DeCoteau loves the slowmo camera as evidenced by the many shots of the four hunks strutting around campus.
The biggest sin, though:  it's not the least bit scary..not the least.
Rent this one, don't buy it.",1074211200,4,705,4.737704918032787
1648673,4,B00005QIVO,"Finally a horror movie that shows something besides girls' cleavage -- guys' cleavage.  Hunky college freshman Chris (Samuel Page), who evidently forgot to pack any shirts, becomes entangled with a secret society of guys who hang around in their underwear gazing lustfully at each other -- oh, and drink blood so they can stay forever hunky.  One might consider this a homophobic association of gay people with vampires, except that Chris has a doting roommate who sits awfully close to him on the bed and also forgot to pack any shirts.  Roomate struggles to unravel the mystery, getting himself into all sorts of dangerous spots and finally mounting a daring rescue.  At the end of the movie, they walk off together, no doubt to transfer to West Hollywood Tech.
It's been done before, obviously -- Corey Haim plays a gay boy trying to de-vampirize his brother in ""The Lost Boys.""  But never with so much eye-candy and homoerotic sizzle, and a quiet boy-next-door romance on top of it.  If only somebody had the nerve to use the ""g"" word, just once, it would get 5 stars.",1060041600,31,1072,4.736559139784946
1648674,3,B00005QIVO,"This movie was a bit of a suprize. I expected a low budget film and was impressed at how well it was made. It was enjoyable and entertaining. I would have to say that it would never be up for an Oscar, but it was fun to watch.",1048636800,2,226,3.7291666666666665
1648675,1,B00005QIVO,"There is certainly a large contingent of people who will rent this film and enjoy it - I am not one of them.  The DVD case and VHS box lead you to believe that you are to be excited by seeing some really hot young male vampires just light up the screen and frighten the bejesus out of you.
The boys may be attractive, but as soon as they open their mouths all sense of attractiveness dissipates.  These guys couldn't act their way out of a wet paper sack.  And the script....can you say P U?  The dialogue is so badly written (and even more poorly executed by these boys) that you wonder if there is now a school teaching bad film writing that gets produced.
Apparently if you are good looking and can miraculously stumble your way onto a film set, this studio will give you a role.  The actors could well be geniuses - but you couldn't swear it by me - they all appear to be as dumb as a box of rocks.
There is supposedly this whole ""homo-erotic"" thing going on.  I didn't see it.  Of course I require more than just a bunch of faces and bodies trapsed across the screen to get excited.
Disappointed by my review - think I've not really reviewed it - okay....here goes:
Hot looking fraternity boys look to recruit a new pledge.....uh oh!.... (scary music here)....they're not really boys.....they're (percussion scary music:  dum dum dum) really vampires!
If you want to associate the whole blood sucker thing with homosexuality (and surely the makers of this film want to do exactly that), then you'll be transfixed.  If you haven't had a total lobotomy, then you'll look at the DVD case; remark at the attractiveness of the boys, and move on to something worth wasting your hard earned cash on.",1025481600,8,1697,4.466019417475728
1648676,1,B00005QIVO,"This is a ""B"" movie at best!  After all the hype from reviews and such I was thoroughly let down.  Yes they were vampires.  No there wasn't blood and gore.  It was supposed to homoerotic.  One scene with guys running around in their briefs.  I still can't figure that one out.
Save your time and money.  Rent ""Interview With A Vampire"".",1010275200,,336,4.409836065573771
1648677,1,B00005QIVO,"Producer/Director David DeCoteau is trying to create a new genre of movie. I'm not sure what it is. ""The Brotherhood"" has elements of a horror movie, yet is not scary; it has elements of suspense, but does not raise any tension; it has elements of homoeroticism, but the one sexual scene is pretty darn straight (or bi, at best, featuring two guys and one girl, although the guys are focused on the girl and not each other). The genre seems to be built around young man in various states of undress (but never seen completely undressed) and is being marketed to gay audiences. Feh. Gay men would be better served by renting or buying any number of softcore movies out there from the likes of Bel Ami than pay for this lame bait and switch.
The plot is your relatively standard T&A (in this case, P&A--and I'm thinking pecs) horror movie, but without the sex or any significant amounts of blood. It takes place at a college where one frat is high above the others. What is it about the frat and its members that make it so special? (Read the other reviews, and you'll know. I won't spoil the plot, such as it is.) The college seems to exist in a time and place of its own with no real town nearby.
Into this setting come two freshmen roommates, Chris (Nathan Watkins) and Dan (Josh Hammond). Chris is your standard issue jock and Dan is your standard issue geek. If you've seen any horror movies from the 80s or 90s, you know the pair. There is an air of sexual tension in the filmmaking, but the movie takes great care to establish that the boys are straight and both interested (kinda) in Megan (Elizabeth Bruderman), one of the few girls on campus. Dan desperately wants to belong, Chris has no interest in being part of the crowd. Chris becomes seduced by Devon, the charismatic president of the top frat. (I base the assessment of the character solely on the mechanics of the plot and not on Bradley Stryker's self-conscious acting.) It is up to Dan to save his friend/roommate. It's a by-the-numbers affair with nothing to make to stand out.
Nathan Watkins is attractive (DeCoteau's camera lingers on his scantily-clad body many times) and his acting is adequate. Josh Hammond gives an animated performance, perhaps too lively. His eyes dart about constantly and his head always seems to be in motion. At least he looks alive, which is more than can be said of some of the other performers. Of the lot, his is the most appealing and interesting performances. He could have a solid future in sitcoms and light comedies if he keeps working.
The script is perfunctory at best. The filmmaking matches the script step-for-step. (That's not a compliment.) There were many cases where I wanted DeCoteau to pull his camera back. He seems to favor close ups, not giving his actor much room within the frame to move. It becomes very claustrophobic, and when combined with some choppy editing, there are times when it becomes very difficult to follow the action.
The DVD offers no extras and the film is presented in 1.33:1 screen aspect ratio. As this was probably shot for direct-to-video, I don't know if there was a version with a wider screen aspect ratio.
All-in-all, if you are considering purchasing this DVD because you are looking for a thriller with gay elements or a cheesy guilty pleasure, look elsewhere. The gay audience should put there money into movies with true gay content rather than settle for this weak tease.

1648678,5,B00005QIVO,"David DeCoteau breaks the traditional mold for low budget horror films in the The BrotherHood. Finally, a cast of beautiful boys become the centerpiece in a genre that stereotypically has ""big on the breasts and small on the grey matter"" teenage girls as victims.
Decidedly homoerotic (as is the sequel, Brotherhood II), but never crossing the line where one could say that this is a ""gay horror film"", The Brotherhood is unique in that while being highly erotic (lots of scenes in ""whitie tighties"" for the male leads), and definately an homage to the male form, the film never becomes gratuitously sexist, nor does it contain nudity.
Even more remarkable, the acting is superb! Nathan Watkins, as the male lead, Chris, is not only extremely handsome, and a delight to watch on screen, but he has talent as an actor.
Refreshing to see this new genre, which DeCoteau refers to as ""horror films for girls"" (though admits freely the homoeroticism is intentional), newcomers to DeCoteau will find that it *is* quite possible to have stunningly visual actors, great acting talent, decent plot and dialogue in a genre of films that often times just stoops to mindless ""sexploitation"" and formula.
Well done! Teenage girls and gay men who like the horror genre will find this DVD well worth it... and, news is that DeCoteau has heard loud and clear from his fans how much we appreciate it. The Brotherhood III and IV are already in production, and for those who find this film an enjoyable one (for whatever reason) will like the sequel as well, and should also check out DeCoteau's ""Voodo Academy"" (be warned though... make sure you get the DIRECTORS CUT of Voodo Academy as Full Moon initially released the film with a full 20+ mins. cut out, because of the homoerotic nature of the film.)",1006992000,17,1785,4.817589576547231

My desire to view it came from being given The Brotherhood II and The Brotherhood III.  Before watching those, I wanted to know how things started.  That being said, I found the film to be mildly entertaining...I didn't fall asleep while watching it, at least.  Unlike other reviewers, I didn't see this as a film for gay audiences, although I can understand why some viewers could choose to see it that way from the scenes featuring shirtless males.  It was a bit odd that the two of the three main male characters and the girl they're with all get down to their undergarments for a bloodsucking session--the two guys slurping blood from the willing gal.
