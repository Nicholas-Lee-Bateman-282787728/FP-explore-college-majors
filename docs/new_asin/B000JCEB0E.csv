If memory serves even Howard did not embrace this and was like warm with his review.  Arty was funny on the show so that gave my review an extra star.,1500681600,,308,4.186440677966102
2669664,3,B000JCEB0E,"I usually don't care for the films that are so local that people not from a particular community won't get. This film is kinda like that, except that despite it being a very New Jersey Film, others can relate to it. The choice of Softball helps and the local bar sponsor help. Most importantly the relationship between Linda and Artie is the type that lots of people can relate to. I deducted two stars because the profanity was excessive and the nudity unnecessary.",1500336000,,466,4.626506024096385

The movie will get you laughing man,so many funny digs at each other. It is hilarious there a bunch of drunks & drug addicts in a softball league.

The jokes and dialogue are hard to follow at times.  This was pretty weak.  Nonetheless Artie rules as a comedian.  He is one of my favorites of all time and I totally recommend his book ""Too Fat to Fish,"" but not this movie.  His other work, ""It's the Whiskey Talkin"" makes me laugh myself silly the whole time I watch.  Long live Artie Lange.

Cons:
1. Low Budget Movie
2. Horrible Acting
3. Extremely Dumb Plot
4. Crude Humor
5. No jokes or no point whatsoever in watching this movie.

Pros:
1. The old guy's line when he says "" I use to F^(% guys like you in prison"" that was the only funny line in the whole movie Do yourself a favor and rent it or stream it BUT DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS POOR EXCUSE OF A MOVIE!

I'm sure the ""critics"" gave it a half star, but thats because they only like movies like ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Milk"", or something else politically correct about gays.

There's plenty of humor and offensive jokes, so if you're looking for a lame hit like ""The Notebook"", this is not a movie for you.

You know, people call these kind of films teenage humor, but would YOU want your teenager watching a film where the sexual content is extremely high around every single turn? I know I wouldn't. Because of that, this is a guy movie.

Hey, I'm a guy and I did enjoy the movie, but there's absolutely no way you can deny how incredibly trashy this kind of humor is.

The storyline is about a team of softball players (grown men with no life) saying the most obnoxious things imaginable to each other (including frequent insults towards each other when someone would mess up a play on the field).

What WAS incredibly funny was the character of a mother always appearing RIGHT when her son was ready to have some disgusting fun with his girlfriend, haha.

2669771,4,B000JCEB0E,"This was an enjoyable movie. Not a ground-breaking comedic epic, but not a bust either. To someone of my age-group (let's say well into their 30's), it gets tiresome to lately see only comedies featuring kids always trying to ""get some"". This is a comedy for ""my"" generation, featuring actors ""my"" age. Put it in the category of say ""Clerks II"" or ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", yet honestly not as good. Artie Lange has always been a funny guy, it's no wonder Stern chose him to replace Jackie, but before radio he was a ""go-to guy"" actor. The comic second-banana relief. Now he's the star, and his second is Ralph ""Outsiders/Karate Kid"" Macchio! This movie has good humor that's never too distasteful while always dangling on the edge. Your kids won't get it, but if you consider yourself too old to be ""Superbad"", you probably will. It's worth a viewing, just don't expect it to go into your Top Ten Comedies section and you'll be fine (if yours goes up to ""twenty"", make room!).

Oh, and for all the DVD Geeks out there (like myself), some of you might remember when this film was first released on DVD as a two-disc set, while it now only is released as one. Originally it was a two-disc set with two ""single-layer"" discs. Now they took both single layers and combined them as one ""dual-layer"" and you still get 95% of the same presentation! All they left out of this version compared to the other is five movie trailers. That's it. Four for other titles by this distributor and the red-band trailer for ""Beer League"".

2669773,3,B000JCEB0E,"I've always liked Artie Lange since I first saw him on MAD TV and in the film Dirty Work (recommended if you haven't seen it) and this film here kind of has a similar structure to it.

Artie plays a slob who plays in a beer league with his friends and they end up in a brawl with another team that leads to a decision that whichever team ranks higher at the end of the season get's to stay, the other one is out.

Along the way to that conclusion Artie finds a girl, has a lot fun, screws a lot of things up and well.. it's just a comedy you'd expect from Artie. I knew it would be food, sex, babes and rock n roll from Artie and thats exactly what this movie is.

It's not a family comedy, so be part of the major majority of people voting ""unhelpful"" votes to those who say this movie is rated 1, if they expected a family comedy type of humor, then don't look at Artie for that sort of thing and just because someone is on a popular radio show doesn't mean he is going to make a movie your kids will love, and this certainly is not Bad News Bears or Major League. It's called Beer League, what does Beer and Baseball make you think of? Drunken sports players, a lot of cussing, a lot of drinking, a lot of booze babes and brawls... what did you expect it to be? ""Gentlemen Leagues of the finer men who sip the old bubbly?"" pfftt... the name clearly states it, and you obviosly don't know Artie's comedy very well if you expected anything other wise.

Some of the comedy falls flat, but a lot of it had me choking on my cigarettes with laughter and I got exactly what I expected out of Artie Lange's Beer League.

It's not a stand out comedy, it's not going to win awards, it's not got the greatest lines ever... but it's a fun movie, with that dirty Artie kind of humor that the real mans man and non uptight women will love. The rest can go watch something like Friends and be fooled by a cute actor that they stare at with a smile and never stop to think ""wait, this cute person's not funny at all""

The bonus features are ok. Some decent interviews with Artie Lange and behind the scenes stuff... whatever the first thing is, a behind the scenes shot was boring, and the ringtones thing is not funny... but the rest is typical classic Artie stuff and it's worth a gander at now and then. I actually even stayed awake through the commentary, it's not great, but it failed to put me to sleep as I wanted it to... guess I'll have to listen to Farrelly Brothers comedy to bore me to sleep at night.",1196640000,,2500,4.144329896907217
2669774,1,B000JCEB0E,"I have never heard of Artie Lange until I watched William Shatner being roasted on Comedy Central.  When Lange took the stage, he said a few things.  He had a very scathing and funny line to Lisa Lampanelli (a shock comic who is about as subtle as a hammer) ""Lisa, you're an overweight, annoying female comic.  You're seven horrible movies away from being Janeane Garofalo"".  Then Artie went on to say that he met Janeane Garofalo and she's a ""f***ing c**t"".  The first line was good, the 2nd was cheap and stupid.  So I decided to watch this when it came on the TV....

It is true that Janeane has made a lot of very bad movies (and a tiny amount of good ones, like Sweethearts and Ratatouille), but nothing she's made compares to the crapfest known as Beer League.  Artie has absolutely no presence as a leading comic man here.  He's horrible in this role.  At least whenever Janeane is in a film, she has presence and, quite often, ends up being the best thing in the film.  This film is yet another variation on the slobbish, lazy guy who mooches off his family and friends and is a real screw up, but really wants to grow up (or something like that).  The film isn't particularly well written or made, but if they had a half way decent comic/actor, there might have been something salvageable.  But, alas, no.  Artie really ruins it, and the film ends up being a real chore to sit through.  It's wretched.",1194393600,2,1410,4.4319066147859925

2669789,4,B000JCEB0E,"For the purposes of my review of Beer League, I want you to forget about Howard Stern - more to the point, don't judge your potential enjoyment of this movie based on your dislike of the infamous shock jock.  I for one do not care for Stern (and I had no idea Artie Lange was ever involved with the radio show), but I pretty much loved this movie.  Sure, it's tasteless and juvenile and has to rank near the top in terms of its curse words per minute average (the MPAA's R rating is based on ""non-stop language"" among other things), but you know what?  I say this is all about boys being boys - Jersey boys being Jersey boys, to be more exact.  As a proud Southerner, I'm not naturally drawn to full-fledged Yankees, but you can't help but feel a kinship with real, 100% men like Artie and his gang who concentrate on the three B's: brewskis, baseball (or softball), and babes.

You know how some guys never grow up?  Well, that's Artie DeVanzo in a nutshell.  He's a thirty-something, beer-guzzling, unemployed lazy slob who lives with his mother (Roseanne's Laurie Metcalf) and is still all caught up in a high school rivalry with the slick and slimy Dennis Mangenelli (Anthony DeSando).  Things get especially heated between their respective softball teams.  This year, the police chief has had enough of breaking up the annual fisticuffs, so he decrees that whichever team finishes behind the other one will be thrown out of the beer league.  This puts Artie and his buddies at quite a disadvantage, as they really aren't very good.  Artie himself likes to smoke and drink out on the field.  After an 0-5 start, though, the guys decide they might need to actually practice if they want to make a miracle comeback and give themselves a chance to knock out Mangenelli's team in the championship game.

Artie Lange is pretty funny, but he could never have carried this movie on his back; luckily, the supporting cast is very funny.  Johnny Trinno (Jimmy Palumbo) always made me laugh with his play-by-play of his .700-chasing at bats, Cara Buono is great as Artie's used-goods but improbably attractive girlfriend, and Ralph Macchio proves he has put his annoying Karate Kid character completely behind him as he plays Artie's best friend Maz (who, in the spirit of the Jersey beer league, postponed his wedding until the end of the season).

Beer League is clearly a guys' movie; unless your girl likes to engage in belching contests and actually understands the basics of professional baseball, she probably ain't going to like this movie one single bit.  It's not like Artie is a noble hero in disguise; he's a jerk for the most part (except when compared with Mangenelli), he's offensive in just about every way possible, and he's basically everything a woman isn't looking for in a man.  For us guys, though, Artie's crude gestures and words, not to mention the give-and-take and acerbic dialogue that defines this movie, are oftentimes as funny as all get out.",1182643200,6,2967,4.730097087378641

Also featuring Ralph Macchio and Jimmy Palumbo, this is a pretty funny crew.  The humor is relatively crude, but still make will make you laugh enough to enjoy at least viewing this once.

There's got to be at least 30-40 laugh-out-loud lines in the movie....I stopped counting and just enjoyed it!

It looks like everyone had a good time making this one including veteran actor and Oscar nominee Seymour Cassel who is one of several scene stealers present.

The movie despite re-creating the actual raunchy language these athlete wannabes use, is quite sweet at heart...congrats to Artie and his director.

Beer League is not for the easily offended due to its constant adult language and situations.  Nonetheless, if you have a good sense of humor and love a good raunchy joke.....this one is a Home Run & due to become some kind of comedy cult classic!

I think Beer League is a very enjoyable movie taking the viewer into the lifestyle of a softball league player and also the culture of dating in this rough/tough envirnomnent of blue-collar workers.

The humor was there and Artie's nemesis in the movie (Dennis Manginelli) played by Anthony DeSando is Halarious with a capital 'H'. Artie's love in the movie (Linda Salvo)is absolutely adorable as can be and I want to state right now, right here that I want to marry her, so Artie beat it! This beauty who plays Artie's love affair in the movie is Cara Buono, and I'm watching whatever tv or movie she ever appears in!  Is this a 4 star epic film? No. But it's definitely a 4 Star just chillin with your girlfriend or wife movie.  I highly rate this movie, and it's already known via Artie on the Howard Stern show that this film didn't do big in the box office. Fair enough. But make sure you go out and rent this DVD or do like I did and purchase it! I've watched it twice already and it made me laugh harder the second time. Niceeeeeee.....

2669825,2,B000JCEB0E,"Artie Lange's infamy as a radio personality on The Howard Stern Show allowed this deservedly straight to DVD film to get into theaters in 2006. Between the box office take and the DVD sales, Beer League might even break even on its $3MM budget. And that speaks volumes to the demographic that would find this film entertaining rather than revolting.

Beer League is not for all Howard Stern fans. There are a hand full of Howard's listeners that will find Lange's film very enjoyable. But much of...if not most of...Howard's audience will cringe at the life of Artie DeVanzo (Lange). One thing is for sure...New Jersey is cringing.

Lange's character DeVanzo is a jobless low-life that plays to the stereotypical Soprano's-esque, degenerate, New Jersey native. Do guys like this exist in New Jersey? Sure. Are there small towns where a crew like DeVanzo and his buddies can be found in Jersey. Yes. But do these guys represent the State of New Jersey and most of the people that live there. No way.

But the movie does give the impression that a visit to Northeastern, NJ and the Jersey Shore will reward you with a predominance of obnoxious behavioral displays which couldn't be farther from the way it really is in the Garden State. (Anyone figure it out by now that I'm born and raised in NJ?)

Okay. Enough about that. The movie...I must admit...was at least watchable. It was as predictable as they come. Antiheroic town boys versus the Jocks. All TV actors giving Saturday Night Live skit caliber performances...albeit R-rated performances. There are some laughs. But mostly this movie is a pointless look into the life of a rude buffoon.

So, if you're a die-hard Artie fan, you'll like Beer League a lot. His personality in the movie isn't that different from what you hear on The Howard Stern Show. And in some strange way, Artie's contributions seem to work on Howard's show. But alone...Artie and Beer League are in a league of their own.",1170028800,,1949,4.788690476190476

I liked the trailer and I am sorry to say I was not prepared for how bad the film is. I feel bad giving Artie 2 stars, but even then if you just go by the movie and not the creator, I would say 2 is really generous.

Artie is sometimes channeling Belushi, sometimes just scowling out his lines, and then occasionally pulls out a nice bit of acting. But the timing is off. The trailer was cut faster to make the comedy pop, but the movie is sooo slow and the laughs just show up and fade away without building. A good lowbrow comedy needs to build - either in grossness or the some plot vehicle that takes you in and this seemed like a bunch of bits and no cohesive plot line to care about.

Sorry to say that because I love Artie. And I find it interesting that as much as his current weight gain is discussed daily on Sirius (he is nearing 300lbs), no one has asked if he got down by the film flopping. I know he had a lot in his mind on this success and when it fizzled, that's when he ballooned. Coincidence? Poor Artie.

It's not the worst film I've ever seen; in fact, I did laugh hard probably a half-dozen times. The problem with the film is Artie Lange himself. It's really nothing more than his stand-up act set on a baseball field. It's crude and offensive, but generally not in a funny way. If you're looking for offensive humor that's actually smart, wait for 'Borat' on DVD.

I listen to 'The Howard Stern Show' on Sirius, and really enjoy Artie Lange's contributions to that program. He just doesn't fit the acting mold. Artie's kind of a poor man's John Belushi, in the same way that 'MAD TV' (from which Artie graduated from in the 90's)is a poor man's 'Saturday Night Live' (which made Belushi a star).

This movie is not going to win any awards. Yet it will be a movie that you will cherrish when you are drunk or just need a good lighthearted movie. Special bonus for the ""pitching machine"". This is a MUST SEE for Howard Stern fans.",1167782400,34,365,4.154929577464789
2669866,5,B000JCEB0E,"I'm a huge Stern fan and saw this opening weekend.  I laughed so much that I was in tears and my face and stomach hurt.  This movie's not for everyone, but if you love raunchy, politically incorrect, nothing is sacred comedy, then you'll love this movie.",1167782400,25,254,4.5
2669867,4,B000JCEB0E,"I did not see this movie in the big house......I heard it sucked and I would hate Artie cause of this really bad movie.  Well I got the dvd and watched it....I laughed from beginning to end. This thing is FUNNY!!!!  It's better than ""Private Parts""",1167782400,11,248,4.369565217391305
2669868,4,B000JCEB0E,"I'm a Howard Stern fan, but not a huge Artie Lange fan. His humor tends to be a little too dumb (racist, homophobic, etc.), but he's is a man's man and there's no denying that all men can relate.

The movie is hilarious, but the real star is not Artie or Ralph Macchio - it's Seymour Cassel (the old guy). His one-liners are spectacular. Artie acts as though he's doing standup all the time. His lines are stilted and aren't really acted out, but he is good enough. The movie is chock full of cameos (Jim Breuer, Tina Fey), strippers, some boobs, and very raw humor.

The main reason for the 4-star rating is the lack of outtakes and deleted scenes. How does a comedy like this NOT have such extras in a 2-DVD package?? There are interviews and behind the scenes pieces. How was NOTHING else captured? I might actually consider making this a 5-star rating were such extras included.

Overall it's a great, simple comedy on par with some of the best.",1167782400,9,949,4.442528735632184
2669869,5,B000JCEB0E,"Artie Lange is GREAT in Beer League. It is a wonderful movie and deservedly received a Thumbs up from Richard Roeper. Buy it, and you will be surprised at how good this movie actually is.",1167782400,9,187,4.371428571428571
2669870,4,B000JCEB0E,This movie was funny and is definitely worth watching. You will get some good laughs. I saw it in the movie theater so hearing the rest of the theater laugh helped create a fun environment but watching it at home should be just as good if not better.,1167782400,10,250,4.229166666666667
2669871,4,B000JCEB0E,"I went to see this film, and laughed all the way through it. I took a friend who had never heard of Artie, and he laughed harder than I did. The writing is sharp, the jokes are cruel but effective, and portions of the film are so true-to-life that they look almost like a documentary.

This movie took a lot of flak from certain critics... who wouldn't know a good time if it bounced a ping pong ball off their head.",1167782400,16,416,4.135802469135802
2669872,1,B000JCEB0E,"This movie just really blew. This movie is pretty much bench warmers with drunks. Artie should stick to what he is good at,KISSING STERNS A**.I saw some mouth breather said this movie was better then Old School. Come on you got to be kidding me. One more thing what happened to the karate kid is this the best he can do now days.",1167696000,6,329,4.238095238095238
2669873,3,B000JCEB0E,"As a fan of Artie's I could not wait to see this film. It's worth watching for the performances of the supporting cast; they are wonderful. There are some fun moments, charming bits and hilarious/raunchy one-liners. My criticisms are these: some of the scenes and dialogue did not seem fluid or natural, and the editing seemed odd in spots and unfortunately Artie is not the best actor. I love his stand-up but his acting chops need some serious polishing. Again see it if you are a fan of Artie's and for a bunch of fabulous segments with awesome character actors. Don't expect too much, let go and you can enjoy this movie.",1167696000,8,625,4.589285714285714

2669885,4,B000JCEB0E,"This movie didn't get the wide release it deserved. Horrible comedies are released nationally every month and very few have more laughs than Beer League. It just may end up gaining some post-DVD release notoriety, such as ""Office Space"" did a few years ago. This movie needs to be judged *as a comedy*. That is to say, it really isn't fair to criticize the intricacies of the plot. Take it for what it is: A good, raunchy, R-Rated comedy with enough great one liners and sight gags to entertain you for 90 minutes.

When Ralph Macchio's character orders an overly healthy lunch in front of his regular-guy Jersey buddies, who wouldn't laugh when Artie says, ""In Massachusetts that order could marry a dude.""?

By the way, it's easy to spot the Opie And Anthony losers that have come here to crap on this. They're the ones speaking broken English and have ""Hoo Hoo"" somewhere in their name or message.",1167696000,17,900,4.654088050314465
2669886,2,B000JCEB0E,"It seems people either think this movie is the greatest or the absolute worst.  Well I think it's somewhere in the middle.  I'm a huge Artie fan but I'm not above saying if his work sucks.  I've heard people say this movie is loaded with hilarious joke after joke....what movie they were watching I have no idea, but it wasn't Beer League.

I laughed probably a dozen times, but most of the dialogue and ""jokes"" in the movie just weren't any good.  I think Artie can be hilarious in his stand-up and on Stern, but in this movie he seems to think if you surround a bad joke with five F-bombs and A-holes it makes it funny...it doesn't.  Making matters worse they cover the same jokes repeatedly.  How many times can they try to make a Guido joke funny?  Watch the R rated trailer and you'll see half of the decent comedy in the entire movie.

The sad thing to me about this movie is it wasn't horrible.  Beer Fest is horrible.  If Artie's acting didn't suck in most of the scenes and 80% of the jokes were refined, it would have been a good comedy.  The way it is now you're just sitting through a mediocre, predictable movie about a beer league team, with a chuckle here and there.  I would say if you were ever in a beer league it might be worth renting this movie.  Maybe if you're an Artie fan or from Jersey.  But for the rest of the world I couldn't recommend it.",1165968000,17,1368,4.248062015503876

I didn't love the ending, but really...this is a movie you see for the jokes, not for the ""plot""! Good Job Artie - give us another one!",1165881600,16,302,4.224137931034483
2669888,1,B000JCEB0E,I was one of the people unfortunate enough to pay to see this movie in the theater. The jokes are not funny and the storyline has been done many times before.,1165622400,11,158,4.129032258064516
2669889,1,B000JCEB0E,"First lets take out the ""fans"" who say this is great because they like Stern and want to hear Artie be happy; Rotten Tomatoes has this ranked at 27% for Critics and 33% for users... it doesn't get much worse than that for a movie with some decent people in it.

Saw the movie when it came out and it was so predictable, so unoriginal and just horrible that we walked out and we were not the only ones doing so. It was so bad that I wasn't surpirsed that it never made it to a nationwide release. I saw it because I'm a Stern fan, I walked out because I'm a bigger fan of comedy.

Artie is funny, his stand up is very good (he is not one of the great ones, but he is way above average) so this movie being horrible is not his fault; it is a shame they put his name on it but they were hoping for the Stern fans to imbrace it... even they didn't.

Save your money, get a couple of Artie's standup DVDs instead and you'll enjoy yourself so much more.",1165104000,23,947,3.973684210526316
