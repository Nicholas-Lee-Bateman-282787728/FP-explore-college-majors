8382638,1,B002VXECFS,"I am tired of NFL Films not giving the San Diego Chargers credit for their accomplishments.  They finish the season with a record of 13-3, and yet the Titans finish at 8-8 and don't even make the playoffs.  How are they making a run for the championship in 2009?  Every other team on the cover made it to the second round of the playoffs.  Where is San Diego?  Where is the DVD of the Epic in Miami, one of the best NFL games ever played?  The only reason they received a history of DVD was due to the AFL 50th anniversary.  Please, think of the fans of all nfl teams, and not just the fans on the east coast.",1275350400,,609,4.067226890756302
8382639,4,B002VXECFS,"NFL Films rarely seem to put a foot wrong and they certainly maintain their high standards with this release. Stunning, beautiful images from the 2008 season combine with the best commentary lines and miked players/coaches to create a brilliant document of the season.
The Super Bowl in particular is expertly handled and truly conveys how exciting a game it was to witness.

The only gripe that some might have is that it is a little short when considering the price tag (the main feature is 87 mins long). This didn't bother me though as the 87 mins on display are more entertaining then most sports DVDs twice the length. You'll get good re-watch value as well.

A nice companion piece to the Super Bowl I - XL set.
