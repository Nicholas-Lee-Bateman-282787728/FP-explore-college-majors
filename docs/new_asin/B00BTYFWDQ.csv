5673408,5,B00BTYFWDQ,"I think that of all the Martin & Lewis movies this one is the best. I will also say that the live performance scenes featuring Martin & Lewis were very well done and could actually work in a real stage situation. Lewis plays the stooge and Dean Martin is the performer who wants to be successful on his own. The Dean Martin character has to concede the act is only a success with the comedy of the Jerry Lewis character, etc... etc... This is a very good movie, it's an older movie but it's very well done.",1388448000,4,506,4.22680412371134
