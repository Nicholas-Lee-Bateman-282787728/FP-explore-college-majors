3961465,3,B002OID512,I like it very much.  However it is too costly and there is no extra features like subtitles.,1264550400,,93,4.166666666666667

3961467,5,B002OID512,"I AM A HUGE PERRY MASON FAN AND HAVE BEEN SINCE 1974. OF COURSE BY THEN THE SHOW HAD LONG BEEN IN RERUNS. MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE EPISODE IS ""THE GUILTY CLIENTS"". I BELIEVE IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN SEASON 5. OF COURSE AS A CONSUMER I HAVE TO SIT BACK LIKE EVERYONE ELSE AND WAIT ON THE NEXT SEASON.

THIS SERIES HAS BEEN RELEASED IN VOLUMES FROM THE START. THERE ARE NINE SEASONS. I CAN ONLY WONDER HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO RELEASE THE REMAINING 5. THIS SERIES IS BEING RELEASED SO SLOWLY IT COULD TAKE AS LONG AS THE SERIES WAS IN PRODUCTION TO FINISH COLLECTING IT.

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. I ALREADY BOUGHT ABOUT SEVENTY TWO EPISODES, BROKEN INTO VOLUMES, FROM COLUMBIA HOUSE. I EXPECTED THEM TO CONTINUE COMING BUT JUST LIKE THE PERSON WHO BOUGHT THEM ON VHS I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY STOPPED. AND I PROBABLY PAID ABOUT $500 DOLLARS. I STILL HAVE THEM TOO. HOWEVER I HAVE NOT BOUGHT PERRY MASON BY SEASON YET. EXCEPT THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION, WHICH I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN.

WHOEVER IS RELEASING PERRY MASON IS LITERALLY MILKING THE CONSUMER. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OTHER SERIES RELEASED THIS WAY. I'M NOT SURE WHEN I'LL START BUYING THE SEASONS. I'M JUST NOT HAPPY WITH THE MARKETING OF ""PERRY MASON""

I GAVE THIS SEASON 5 STARS BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A GOOD SHOW. BUT IT HAS ONLY EARNED A HALF OF A STAR FOR THE WAY IT IS BEING RELEASED AND THE WAY IT IS BEING MARKETED.",1262822400,5,1367,4.3700787401574805
3961468,5,B002OID512,"I bought these for my neice for Christmas.  She loves them. She already has the firsr three seasons,",1262822400,,100,4.555555555555555
3961469,4,B002OID512,Have collected this set since the beginning. Just hope this doesn't end like the VHS series did (just stopped with no notice). Video quality on these sets equals or even betters the VHS tapes. My only problem with this series is the breaking up of the seasons into two sets. Would gladly pay more to get complete seasons. Keep them coming.,1262131200,4,339,4.573770491803279
3961470,2,B002OID512,"I love Perry Mason and this portion of the series is no exception, it's great. BUT, CBS TV is ripping us off. This segment has only 12 episodes on it! When other TV series feature a whole year's worth of episodes, Perry Mason's producers or whoever owns these rights has divided them up to make more money and it's a real turn off. Over $30 for just 12 episodes is just greed.",1261785600,15,376,4.236111111111111
3961471,5,B002OID512,"The second half of the fourth season suffers from the sporadic appearance of Bill Talman's masterful portrayal of Hamilton Burger, the unluckiest district attorney in history. Talman was exiled for a morals clause violation the previous season but brought back by popular demand. CBS seems to have looked for ways to keep the actor off the show. One of the few positive effects of this experimentation is found in an episode entitled ""the Case of the Cowardly Lion"" which is shot extensively on location at the San Diego Zoo and the Kona Kai resort. The zoo in 1961 was indeed a wondrous place, and quite unlike zoos of its era.

Another sixties wonder was the space race. ""The Case of the Misguided Missile"" was shot extensively at Vandenberg Air Force Base, the Pacific missile launch site. Among the cast was William Schallert, later of the Patty Duke Show and the mayor in the Best Picture Oscar winning fim ""In the Heat of the Night"". Also in the cast of that episode was  James B. Sikking, a Hill Street Blues regular.

However most times when Burger and Tragg are absent the courtroom drama lacks real sizzle. The replacement prosecutors are never haunted by Burger's horrendous won-loss record against Mason, and sort of plod along. Talman projects a hunger to win, and when he doesn't he is always gracious. These other prosecutors just disappear. In one episode, Mason with tongue firmly in cheek, tells Paul and Della that he was to rush to the courthouse because ""Hamilton Burger is about to win a case.""

As always the writers worked closely with Mason's creator Erle Stanley Gardner. They had to. Gardner had final approval of all scripts. And that is the reason this series remained true to Gardner's vision. After Gardner died in 1970, the series was revised as TV movies starring Raymond Burr. Not one of the TV movies approaches the quality of any episode in this box set. And that is all the reason in the world to add it to your DVD collection.",1260662400,48,1964,4.717201166180758
3961472,5,B002OID512,"Watched this show religiously as kid. Still getting mocked by those who favor the likes of Law and Order when I defend Perry. (Pun intended I guess). But when I bought the first one of the series I hadn't seen it in maybe 30 years. Gotta admit I was stunned by how unethical and rude he can be. Don't know why I remembered him as warm. Now he's more human in my eyes and I feel sorry for Paul Drake who appears to be the precursor of Dano in Hawaii 5--0. Purely the lackey who doesn't get the credit in the end.
Doesn't matter though. Perry always saves the day. So much the American hero.",1258329600,3,589,4.130434782608695
3961473,5,B002OID512,"Perry Mason is as much a part of American culture as apple pie and mom. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone of any age who doesn't at least recognize the name. Erle Stanley Gardner's books have millions of devoted fans. The television show it spawned was fabulous as entertainment, and today is widely regarded as one of the best shows television ever produced. Perry was the attorney you wanted on your side in a jam.

It was Gardner himself who picked Raymond Burr, even though the studio only agreed to let him test for Perry if he would test for Burger too! Barbara Hale was his pretty secretary, Della Street, who kept Perry human and was in love with him. William Hopper was the dapper detective, Paul Drake. He had a playful and flirtatious relationship with Della but every viewer knew that secretly her heart belonged to Perry. And we liked it that way.

William Talman as D.A. Hamilton Burger would almost be ready to gloat, Lt. Tragg (Ray Collins) not far behind, when Perry would spring his client by revealing the real killer on the witness stand. There has never been anything close to it in genre on television since. Its mix of drama, noir, and humor, and its truly likable central cast of characters, made for terrific viewing.

Season four was terrific. Releasing them in half seasons, the first half on volume one, the second on volume two now, is indeed an effective but annoying marketing scheme. I agree the price should be lowered, but at the same time agree that as entertainment, this is an incredible value. So, much like gasoline and food, you pay what you have to. Hopefully at some point, Amazon or Paramount will make an effort to still make a profit with a sure-fire hit, while giving fans a better purchase price.

Season four episodes, beginning in September of 1960 and ending in June of 1961, are as follows: The Case of the Treacherous Toupee--The Case of the Credulous Quarry--The Case of the Ill-Fated Faker--The Case of the Singular Double--The Case of the Lavender Lipstick--The Case of the Wandering Widow--The Case of the Clumsy Clown-- The Case of the Provocative Protege--The Case of the Nine Dolls--The Case of the Loquacious Liar--The Case of the Red Riding Boots--The Case of the Larcenous Lady--The Case of the Envious Editor--The Case of the Resolute Reformer--The Case of the Fickle Fortune--The Case of the Waylaid Wolf--The Case of the Wintry Wife --The Case of the Angry Dead Man--The Case of the Blind Man's Bluff--The Case of the Barefaced Witness--The Case of the Difficult Detour--The Case of the Cowardly Lion--The Case of the Torrid Tapestry--The Case of the Violent Vest--The Case of the Misguided Missile--The Case of the Duplicate Daughter--The Case of the Grumbling Grandfather--The Case of the Guilty Clients

This was one of the best dramas ever to hit the air. Seeing it today reminds us just how good television can be, but is often not. It's a bit of nostalgia and a lot of entertainment for TV fans. Fred Steiner's ""Park Avenue Beat"" remains one of the most recognizable themes ever heard. A must for fans of Perry Mason.",1254009600,61,3091,4.780898876404494

3961498,5,B002OID512,"Perry Mason Season 4 Volume 2

These twelve TV films from 1961 are mostly stories based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative and tell stories about life that is not experienced by most people. The books can tell you why certain things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, and how to evade surveillance and avoid leaving a back trail. Some may question the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The backgrounds tell about life in Los Angeles. It is difficult to film a scene at night but easy to describe it in a book. Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free many unjustly convicted persons. Gardner, among others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. The theme music is typical for that era. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from the late 1950s. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent on these films.. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings. The cars tell of product placement. A story adapted from a novel has the year.

3961557,5,B002OID512,"Attention: missile history buffs.  The episode ""The Case of the Misguided Missile"" was filmed on Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.  There are various shots of early versions of the Atlas rocket - the nicest being an outdoor shot of Mason questioning the Major, who is accused of murder, and behind them, in the distance, is an Atlas on the launch pad . . . .

Aside historical note:  According to the box, this episode aired on 6 May 1961.  The timing of this broadcast is interesting.  On the day before, the first American, Alan B. Shepard Jr., was launched into space on a Redstone missile.  This rocket was only powerful enough to send the astronaut on a suborbital trajectory to an altitude of 116.5 miles (187.5 kilometers.)  It wasn't until February 1962, that American John H. Glenn Jr. could be sent into orbit by the more powerful Atlas.

Yes, the series repeats a formula in each episode and it is hard to believe the guilty party almost always breaks down and confesses at the trial. But the courtroom scene is exactly like the trials I covered when I was a reporter. Raymond Burr is really believable as a lawyer, and Della is very sexy. Mason seems to work gratis so often I worry that he may not be able to keep Della on. I won't review the other volumes about because I said it all on his one.",1387670400,,594,4.173913043478261

3961574,5,B002OID512,"None of the stories are based on Earle Stanley Gardner's novels, but I found all of them to be excellent, and well-acted. William Tallman appears in a few of these as Perry's legal nemesis Hamilton Burger.  There are other actors to do an adequate job as fill-in prosecutors, including one notable one who was a defendant in a series one episode (he guests twice as the prosecutor). I honestly believe he could have been a good replacement for Tallman, had the powers that be not come to their senses and rehired the best Perry Mason legal adversary. Guest stars include actors who had small and prominent roles in Sci-Fi television shows from the 1950's and 1960's. I found myself thinking ""hey, I've seen so and so in this show...""  Great fun!",1387152000,,745,4.679389312977099

He has all the qualities one can admire such as unfailing honesty, integrity, protector of the little guy as well as biggest, unfailing good instincts, belief in true justice, and more. He has the perfect team with Paul Drake and Della Street who always provide key information just at the right time. With one interesting episode after another, what more could you ask for? Here's an era before cell phones and computers. Here's an era when our country was the best and moral envy of the world. Big cars and cheap gas were the norm, the economy was great, and all things reflected the best in the USA with Perry Mason fighting to keep justice alive.

I'm glad I did, it's nice to see shows that weren't commonly seen on TV. I look forward to getting more of the later seasons. From Season 4 forward Burger is not always the featured prosecuting attorney and some reviewers have criticized that aspect of the show. I enjoy the friendly opposition between Mason and Burger as much as anyone but I don't believe the show loses it's appeal, or quality, b/c Burger is no longer a regular. I enjoy the different locations and prosecuting attorneys in the cases Mason ends up with. I believe it adds needed variety to the show.

Guessing who did it is not always easy.  We watch them and after a few months take them out and watch them again; they are timeless.",1284595200,2,418,4.1875

3961634,5,B002OID512,I have always regarded the Perry Mason show as good entertainment and yet educational. The scenes where crimes are committed are not graphic showing gory details of the crime while at the same time viewing the law in action through court drama is informative while entertaining.,1272153600,,278,5.065217391304348
3961635,5,B002OID512,"I used to watch Perry Mason with my grandmother ... it was our shared time together.  Rewatching them today, it is not just the memories, but I enjoy seeing the clothes, interiors and cars of my college years.",1271980800,,209,4.5
3961636,5,B002OID512,This is a must-have if you're collecting the series. I will note that at least two episodes are also on the 5oth anniversary DVD.,1269907200,,129,4.416666666666667
3961637,5,B002OID512,"These DVD's are of excellent quality, and do the series justice, pun intended.
I prefer the box and individual folders packaging they started out with, as opposed to the layered in one box format.  Also, knowing that the entire series is available, I also don't understand the trickling out half a season at a time either, but so far I'm hanging in there because the shows are so good and I do want to complete them.",1266364800,,416,4.473684210526316
3961638,3,B002OID512,"I love the Perry Mason series and always can't wait to get the next one.  I usually pre order them.  I have not had any problems with the other volumes but this set won't play in one of our dvd players-the others will.  So we still have been able to watch this volume on our other player we were disappointed it wouldn't play in the room we wanted to watch it in.  That is the only reason for 3 stars instead of 5.

3961639,5,B002OID512,"When this set of DVD'S (5) became available I went for it. With twenty episodes to choose from,they all bring out one of the truely fine entertainment venues to hit the TV screen in the 50's. The writing,acting,and producing are infallible.
  If you were around then,these episodes will amaze you. They run,without interruption for about 50 minutes per. And,not to give away anything,you never know ""who did it"" until the final act!
  If this is what you want(full screen and b/w) then I advise you to scoop up these,especially the 1st year(1957-58) whis is composed of Vols. I and II.
 With approximately 950 minutes per volume, it will take a while,but it will also take you back. A fine set indeed.",1265500800,2,701,4.760330578512397
3961640,5,B002OID512,These shows are what Perry Mason fans have come to expect and the production quality is good but not wonderful.  My only complaint is that the new seasons are so slow in coming and there seem to be fewer shows included in the sets as you get further into the releases. I'm hoping Season 5 will be released soon.,1265328000,,311,4.271186440677966
3961641,5,B002OID512,"Great court room drama.  Raymond Burr was the best Perry Mason ever.

It is not Amazon's fault this great show is being released so slowly.  Many will be dead before the last season is sold to the public.  Think how much money they will lose.  Their loss!!  Hope the ones releasing this series are reading our many comments.",1265155200,,324,4.5
3961642,3,B002OID512,"the writing seems less crisp , less sophisticated, perhaps even dumbed down. Then there is the pathetic delay between volumes. I wonder what MBA bean-counter came up with this marketing strategy. I know, let's wait till the baby boomers and their parents all die off and then see how many DVDs we can sell. Right! But the characters are still there. So yep , I'll still get volume 5 , IF I live to see it come out.",1265068800,,414,4.32051282051282
