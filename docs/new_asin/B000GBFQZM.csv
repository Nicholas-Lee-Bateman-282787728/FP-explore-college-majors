8130330,5,B000GBFQZM,"This is perhaps the most outstanding video on Veil technique ever made.  Joynan explains and demonstrates clearly and effectively to allow students to master beautiful movement in conjunction with the use of proper materials needed to make veils.  This video is thorough and allows dancers at all levels to succeed.

8130331,5,B000GBFQZM,"Great tutorial for Beginners, if you are new in Bellydance this is a video for you, is a good introduction to veil technique, is challenger and fun, it shows sevelar fabrics you can use too.",1203379200,,190,4.457142857142857
8130332,4,B000GBFQZM,"Joynan is accesable to everyone.  She speaks clearly and without ""ums"" and doesn't fidget!  She stands front and center and you can clearly see everything she does (although the camera is a little grainy).  She explains things step by step and demonstrates them several times before moving on.  This is not a work out DVD (Thank God!!) so there is filler movement or repitition of choreography.  Its just instruction.

The performance sections are really poor quality camera work, but the choreography is creative (and a little akward at times).

There aren't that many DVDs solely devoted to technique, so if you are teaching yourself, this video is a MUST.",1172102400,16,658,4.981651376146789
8130333,5,B000GBFQZM,"I wasn't familiar with this dancer and so bought this ""on a risk"" I'm glad I did. It's a well put together, clear and concise tutorial on using double and single veil. Moves are put together logically and with increasing complexity. The explanations are great and Joynans warmth makes it fun to follow. Useful for dancers from any discipline and I've found some of the techniques useful with children and special needs students.",1156032000,12,428,4.876712328767123
