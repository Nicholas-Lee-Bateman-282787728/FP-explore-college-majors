831724,5,6304239815,"A wonderful story of caring community and wise mentoring friends who help us to grow out of immaturity and pride.  Great scenery, music and acting.  A winner",1182988800,7,157,4.777777777777778
831725,5,6304239815,"This Is One Of The Best Movies About The Amish That I Have Ever
Seen. It Was Very Believable And Very Well Portrayed. Patty Duke And Lolita Davidovich Are Two Of My Favorites.
The Chemistry They Had Onscreen Was Amazing. If You Miss This Movie, You`ll Miss One Of The Best Hallmark Movies Ever Made.",1088553600,7,299,4.454545454545454
831726,5,6304239815,"I've studied about the Amish for years and was very impresed with this film. All thoug I knew most of the information that was givin about them. I thought that the aded protrayl of the ""Outsiders""(what the Amish call us Englisheres) was very good. Thoguh it might not have the same pep as Wittness did with Harrison Ford.
It has more information on what the Amish go through when personal tragedy striks.
 The movie is like able and the protryal that Sally-Sal( Lolita Davidoich) is excelent.
The Amish are strict when it comes to gender positions. As this was shown in the movie. Where the sherrif asks Sally to dress more plain and not in such a low cut beautifel two piece out fit she was wearing earlier when the first met.
In fact the sheriff was suprised that Sally was sent over to Lancasater becaouse she was a women. Again another sign that the Amish still are not quite as comfterbul with wemon having more postion.
 Even so this is an excallent movie. It shows how Sally's almost none exsints information about the Amish grows through the film. And how she becomes friends with Patty Duke's character Annie.",1049846400,24,1118,4.613065326633166
831727,5,6304239815,"This is a good look at Amish people. I have visited the Lancaster, PA area. If one is interested in the Amish this tape portrays some of what happens, for instance there is one scene where the ""English"" (tourist) is trying to take pictures of the Amish. Picture taking is frowned upon based on the scripture in
Exodus 20:4  Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth etc",1014336000,7,502,4.229166666666667
831728,4,6304239815,"An Amish community is plagued by an arsonist who is burning family barns. An FBI investigator is put on the case and enters the world of the Amish. There is a tension between the cultures and values of the Amish and the  outside world. The film is about faith, community, and forgiveness. A  tender film appropriate for the entire family. Challenges us to reflect  upon our own values.",956016000,21,385,4.632352941176471

831854,4,6304239815,"Giving it four stars here, because  it gave the first inside look I've ever seen into the Amish culture. Interesting in the sense it seemed very realistic. So, realistic that it is somewhat boring however. This is obviously at least partially from a real story. The female police officer saving the baby in a barn burning down, was thrown in to add some excitement and drama to the movie, other than that a picture of the stark, and somewhat sad reality of the Amish cult.",1435104000,,472,4.552941176470588

831914,5,6304239815,"This is a mystery. The storyline sparks with the burning of a barn. Accidental? Then more barns are burned. As the characters are introduced, it becomes clear that emotions are aflame in this community. Religious beliefs, human nature, and matters of the heart collide. I enjoyed this movie. Patty Duke is a favorite and her acting never disappoints me.",1398124800,5,353,5.0

I watched it on VHS & it was very good, so I started to look for it on DVD",1391212800,2,87,3.1904761904761907
831918,5,6304239815,I originally had this on video but bought the DVD because videos took up too much space.  I love the way two women of very different backgrounds forge a friendship.,1377820800,2,164,4.466666666666667
832000,5,6304239815,"I saw this movie years ago.  I looked for it on Amazon.com and found it!  It's a great story!  I ordered it and the person who sent it to me sent a note along with it stating that she hoped I would enjoy it.  Well, I certainly do.  Great landscape and if you like romance too, you'll like it.",1376524800,2,292,3.8813559322033897
832001,5,6304239815,Harvest Of Fire is very well done. The story about the Amish people helped me learn about them. Patty Duke glowed in her role as the mother who held everything together after her husband's death. An interview with Patty is a special feature.,1373068800,4,241,4.627906976744186
832002,5,6304239815,Patty Duke shows grace and is a great teacher in this heart warming movie. It's high interest and brings real insight. I especially enjoyed the huge amount of community support displayed for a young man owning up to a poor choice.,1368748800,2,230,4.634146341463414
832003,4,6304239815,"Not as good as ""Witness"". This is a fairly decent drama. There are some twists and turns. One gets a fairly accurate look into the Amish lifestyle and how much authority a church bishop has.",1352678400,2,190,4.457142857142857
832004,5,6304239815,"I saw this on TV years ago and have been looking for a copy ever since. Patty Duke does an excellent job and the Amish life and heritage is well explained. It is very interesting to see the parallels to my own Mennonite upbringing. Good acting, great story line, and a good lesson in forgiveness that we can all take to heart.",1334016000,8,326,4.274193548387097
832005,4,6304239815,"This movie held my interest at a personal level, but I find it lamentable that anyone admires such a rigid and superstitious religious group.  The Amish sing the praises of family, while obeying edicts that include the cruel and ignorant practice of shunning.  A mother for example, who is shunned for thinking or behaving outside Amish tradition, which is treated as ""law,""must be abandoned by her family.  If she incurs the resentment of the local ""bishops,"" her husband and children can be forced to cut their ties with her, refusing even to speak to her or eat at her table.  Of course, this goes for men as well, who demonstrate the evils of independent thinking.  This pathologic adherence to severe religious law has the power to tear a family apart and leave a man or woman isolated and abandoned among their ""community"" of former children, friends and loved ones. So much for family!

Of course, not to single out the Amish, the contradictions in any religion are obvious. I thought Hallmark did a passable job here, of pointing out the evils of shunning, and the destructive consequences of this negative and archaic practice.  Amish or Christian/Muslim, it is tiresome to see otherwise reasoning adults bow in obeisance to despicable old fools who think that their anatomy and silly costumes are a substitute for decency, and an excuse to wield power over others.",1327276800,,1374,4.896551724137931
832006,5,6304239815,"I had taped this movie off the the television years ago. I watched the movie many times, until the quality of the tape was no longer any good. I was so glad that they put this on DVD. I think this is one of the best movies ever made about the Amish. Patty Duke was wonderful in it. She is one of my favorite actors and she certainly did not let me down in ""Harvest of Fire.""",1326931200,7,374,3.8701298701298703
832007,5,6304239815,I'm always looking for something of substance in the unglorified products. I find this to be a rare gem. I'm glad I gave this a shot. Ms. Kelly is a treat with no make-up. The picture of America is worth one's time.,1324080000,2,215,4.142857142857143
832008,5,6304239815,"Once again, a stellar performance from Patty Duke playing an Amish widow. This film involves the Arson of Barns in the local area, and the successful police investigation following. Apart from the legalities, the film  includes more, which depicts a forged friendship between the female police investigator and Patty Duke's character, who are; typically world's apart; but each person gleans an insight and appreciation of  each others world.  A must see, feel good movie with Christian values as a foundation. Thanks again for your quick and efficient service. Regards Mr Terry Somerville, Gawler, South Australia.",1270944000,7,615,5.4526315789473685
832009,2,6304239815,"Although because of their number the Amish aren't considered a cult,
their behavior lands in that category.
Here the shape of a barn roof causes big problems
and they almost get some ""English' into
deep trouble. Religious freedom is a ""fiction"" in the United States:
that became clear with the sending of Islamic fundamentalists to
Cuba in the Bush administration. Quakers and Amish and Latter Day Saints( Mormons)
are a few of the people who have been persecuted long term for being different.
WASP and Catholic are the ""norm"" that is tolerated.
Except for not using modern machines the Amish are
very like a lot of other Protestant sects;
more like Hasidic fundamentalist Jews than Christians maybe?
I don't think that hating people for their religion is good, but
some religions are actually damaging to the people involved
long term.
I don't think we should encourage people to think such
behavior is all right. The results are a very thorny
civil rights problem.",1250726400,,967,4.938650306748467

7867113,5,6304239815,A wonderful movie for the entire family. This movie introduces the viewer into the world of the Amish so they will understand the practices and the beliefs of the Amish people.
