5978343,4,B00FDW78K0,"For years the Super Task Force Six protected Earth until the day they no longer needed. Fifteen years has passed and the former Red Enforcer has discovered the truth. In his dying breathe, he gifted the green transformation device to an unlikely hero. With the help of his friends, Jason Oliver must learn to use the Green Enforcer powers to stop Emperor Zagel from enacting his final plan.

The characters are as followed:

Jason Oliver, a down-on-his-luck writer who must learn to overcome his fears to fully come into being the Green Enforcer. Has a pragmatic side of himself when it comes to fighting.

Paul, Jason's friend and a fanboy of the Super Task Force. Is a cross between the comic relief and the mentor.

Amy, Jason's girlfriend. Serves as the one to push Jason into accepting his new role and a bit of tech support.

Ada, the AI inside the transformation device who serves as the other mentor and tech support for Jason.

Emperor Zagel, an enemy of the previous Super Task Force who was able to take control of the world and needs the green transformation device to put his final plan into action.

Munkar, the comic relief of the villains and, yet, the most sensible one of the three. Thanks to Jason he now has a dental plan.

Azrael, the heavy of the three and the first monster Jason fights.

Super Task Force One is one giant love letter to the henshin hero genre that wears its influences on its sleeves. From Zyuranger (the scene between the dying Red Enforcer and Jason) to Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (Jason's name and the characters of the Eugene and Hunk) to RPM (the film's use of lampshade hanging humor). Fans of Super Sentai and Power Rangers would get the most out of the film. In fact, I found it to be a better celebration of the twentieth(-first) anniversary of Power Rangers than the actual anniversary season.

However, because of its shoestring budget, it is hampered in some areas. From the villains' costumes to the Green Enforcer's biker helmet and spandex to the fights (with the exception of the ending mech battle; was the most dynamic and lived up to being the climax). But the film's love to genre easily makes up for such shortcomings. After all, Power Rangers is shot on a TV show equivalent of a shoestring budget and only looks good by splicing in footage from another show, yet fans both young and old still love it for what it is.

PS: I love the fact they had David J. Fielding (the actor who's face was used for Zordon and voiced him in season 1) cameo as the creator of the Super Task Force. I also loved that the Super Task Force has an orange operator, instead of the standard yellow. It's the little things that helps it become its own thing.",1457049600,2,2701,4.559917355371901

Too bad their won't be a sequel anytime soon , but at least we get to own it on DVD ; though , I would have loved the disc to have had any level of bonus features .",1404518400,,296,3.7142857142857144

8614563,2,B00FDW78K0,"As a longtime fan of the sentai and tokusatsu genre, I can see where they're going with most of the film and what the creators are trying to accomplish. They almost pull it off too.  The script is good and the acting is decent enough as well. The low budget doesn't detract from the spirit either. Where STF1 fails though is in the really poor camera work and sub-par editing. A bit more focus on framing the action and the blocking of the actors on set would make for a huge improvement. A lot of the scenes could also use a slight tightening on the edit as well. It's 70% there, it just needed a little more focus on those fundamentals to go from unbearable to a solid genre piece. I want to really like it. But as it stands, it just bad.",1511568000,2,740,4.174825174825175

8614565,2,B00FDW78K0,"This could have been great. Like, they had the right amount of special effects, and fair enough resources for costumes. The script was actually pretty good, it was the lack of having any actors with experience that ruined the writing. It's a shame, because there were some things going for it.. but because they couldn't be bothered to find any theater or drama geeks to do the acting with their budget, didn't bother to do any real choreography for the fighting... and the bad guys all talked like a light night conversation with your long distance girl friend at 3 am.... I feel like with a little bit of effort, re-editing, and some one that actually knows anything about voice acting... This could be the greatest zentai film ever. So props to the imagination, and the editing... but major criticisms to those that wanted to be in the movie, instead of using people that could actually act the parts. That's always the hard part about low budget films. Every one just get's their friends to be in it, and guess what? Most people can't act. So find roles that fit for every ones specialty so that your movie becomes the best there is, backed by people doing what they are the best at. Like the special effects, that person did a great job. Who ever wrote the script, great job. Everything else, you should probably seek out other people for acting roles in the future. What made Power rangers great, was that they used actors, that already have a background in martial arts, or another active interest. This made their fight scenes great, believable, and even having a cheese script they still pulled it off, because they are actors, and thats what good actors do.",1504483200,2,1667,4.654237288135593

8614568,5,B00FDW78K0,"Being familiar with Director Rudzinki's later work like CarousHELL I was curious to see how he would treat the whole Power Rangers genre. I'm basically familiar with the Power Rangers, but not an actual fan. I know how the whole thing works, but couldn't quote who any of the specific actors, villains or monsters were past Rita Repulsa. It was fun to watch them take the basic premise and stay true to the basic concept while skewering some of the tropes of the series itself. I laughed out loud when the head bad guy sent flunkies to fight our erstwhile hero and was amazed that he transformed into The Green Enforcer instead of fighting them in his normal identity. There was a playground fight and while there wasn't the budget that the original show had, it still worked. Kudos to a well done tribute/parody of an iconic television show.",1482883200,2,842,4.657718120805369
