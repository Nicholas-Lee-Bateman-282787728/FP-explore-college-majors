8362446,1,B000G1TQ80,"So being a  Ducati buff and just having bought a secondhand 999R at a snip of a price with only 300 miles on the clock I was sucking up all that was the 999.... so you can imagine my disgust to get this load of rubbish, some guy on his bike on a track doing nothing and then it kept getting stuck and still nothing happens! Ducati is elegance and style and charm and Italian.... but don't waste your money on this ...I agree with the giy who says Ducati ...hunt 'em down and bury them",1176595200,3,484,4.041666666666667

ducati should hunt this chump down and cull them like a baby seal.

although, like the above reviewer, i too did not make it to the end of the dvd. maybe there were some redeeming features near the end? doubtful.

so bad.

seriously.

thanks for reminding me to think before i buy.
