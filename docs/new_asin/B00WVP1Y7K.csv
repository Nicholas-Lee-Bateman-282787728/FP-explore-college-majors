Andrews Blu-ray Review: Unbelievably, SPACE JAM is celebrating its 20th Anniversary, and to celebrate this milestone for the classic animation-live action hybrid film, Warner Home Video Entertainment has celebrated with this 2016 Blu-ray Release. This blend of Looney Tunes adventure with the patience of Michael Jordan made for a box office success that was admired by few and battered by others. If your thoughts on SPACE JAM got very negative reviews from the critics or was not very favourable for you way back in 1996, you likely will not find yourself suddenly coming around to purchasing this Blu-ray disc. For those who do have some nostalgic joy or genuinely find amusement for this type of film with combination of animation with live action and especially the admiration for the technological know-how achievement that they had at their disposal in 1996, then this Blu-ray disc is definitely for you.

SPACE JAM stars six-time NBA champion Michael Jordan and Warner Bros. classic Looney Tunes gang in a dimension-bending sports showdown. The plot is pretty straightforward. The basic story follows an alternate timeline, and in the film Michael Jordan has recently retired from basketball and is trying to make a career in baseball, but especially with his retirement was spent training with the Tune Squad basketball team in an effort to defeat the evil alien Monstars in a game of hoops. Meanwhile, the Looney Tunes have been invaded by aliens and end up recruiting Michael Jordan to help them defeat the aliens in a basketball match that will determine whether or not the Looney Tunes are taken to another planet to perform as slaves. That makes it sound darker than it is when this is actually a pretty fast-paced sports comedy featuring some cartoon favourites and Michael Jordan doing just enough to show off his affable personality.

SPACE JAM is one of my favourite films of 1995. Sure, its not a perfect film of this genre, and maybe the script could have been better put together and Michael Jordan could be less of a stiff in front of a green screen as well as the other basketball players, but despite this it is just so much fun. The Looney Tunes are at their best and top of their game, and for fans of NBA Basketball, there are constant cameos. The early scenes featuring the NBA stars on after they lose their talents are some of the funniest moments in the film. The soundtrack is an essential part of the 1990s, with so many major hits that you could play them all day long. As long as I live, I will remember the lyrics: Everybody get up its time to slam now. We got a real jam goin down. Welcome to the Space Jam. Heres your chance, do your dance at the Space Jam.

Director Joe Pytka deserves credit for doing all he can to make Michael Jordan interactions in this animated environment look great for the time. The film is no Who Framed Roger Rabbit? as far as just how solid the screenplay and merging of filmmaking ideas can be in a time where computer generated CGI was less of a thing in 1996. Still, there are some really good laughs, especially with the Looney Tune cartoon characters, in addition to noting what kind of effort went into making a convincing basketball game that involves Michael Jordan and the Looney Tune animated characters. Whether or not you laugh at all of this is another story.

There are some pop culture references here and there, plus there is a reference to the film Pulp Fiction that seems to have come out of left field from nowhere and the general zaniness of the Looney Tunes is completely present. Some of it works well enough, even if some of the mischief is toned down a bit. As for the actor Bill Murray being in the film, what the hell was the point of including him, as he was absolutely totally atrocious and was a complete pointless exercise why he was ask to be in the film, as he was to my mind the least funniest character in the film and really annoyed me. But what was also totally and equally embarrassing were the most obnoxious child actors I have ever witnessed, as they were totally ghastly and could not act in any professional capacity and should have been left on the cutting room floor.

SPACE JAM has not in my opinion really aged that much, because nothing about it has really changed. It is the same as it ever was which means you can laugh out loud without feeling embarrassed and you will really enjoy the brilliant animation effort that went into making the film. It is a sort of vanity project, especially to highlight the Looney Tune characters, but Warner Bros. had invested enough money and ideas to do what they could to make it worth their while. So all in all, this film is a totally madcap Looney Tune fun festival, especially seeing all your Warner Bros. cartoon characters in one film and I thought the brilliant effects of the actors performing with the Looney Tune characters was totally brilliant and amazed how the director Joe Pykta pulled it all together and also great praise should go to all the technical people behind the scene who managed to get everything to come together so smoothly, and to me personally it was all done in a very professional way, to make the film a very fun filled enjoyable experience. By the way, please watch right to the very end of the credits, as you will get a really nice surprise and a good ending to this fun filled rip roaring rollercoaster film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video brings you this Blu-ray disc release in a stunning 1080p image presentation and an equally impressive 1.85:1 aspect ratio. The clarity detail seems to have not attempted to remaster the film for this latest release, and SPACE JAM looks really great for a 1996 release, but nothing special. This is a consistent viewing experience that benefits from some sharp details at play thanks to the 1080p HD upgrade. The depth of field with the blending of Jordan with animation, you actually do get a sense of dimensionality here that does not go unnoticed. The Black levels are strong enough, though nowhere as deep and rich as other animated features that have come out more recently. As to the colour reproduction, you get to view brilliant colours pop out of the screen, which is great for a film that features lots of colourful Looney Tunes characters. Also the Flesh Tones you see, especially with a close up of Michael Jordan and the live-action sequences standout really well. Facial textures register appropriately enough. As to any noise and artefacts effects, especially for a film that was released in 1996, is less of an issue, given the previous attempt to remove spots and other inconsistencies.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video brings you a great 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound experience, and the films soundtrack does plenty to provide the preferred audio enjoyment for a flick featuring Looney Tunes and basketball noises. The cinematic interpretation of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and others means getting a bit more depth than usual and matching that with a soundtrack, Michael Jordan and more. It manages to work quite well here. Thanks to some choice soundtrack selections and the basketball action that goes down very well and all the speakers gets to shine a good number of times. The balance is well-handled here. All the wacky voices are heard on the centre channel, in addition to good care placed on hitting the others. As to the dialogue reproduction, everyone, human, animated, or otherwise, is heard with great clarity.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Daffy and Director Joe Pytka: Here first up is an introduction by Bugs Bunny [Billy West] to introduce this audio commentary, and informs us that Joe Pytka will be sticking his head in for a word of two. Next we hear Bugs Bunny introduce the voice actor Billy West; also next up to be introduced is the voice actor Dee Bradley Baker. But at the point director Joe Pytka walks in the room again and basically informs us he only did part of the film that included the live action scenes and especially with Michael Jordan acting his socks off. There is a lot of talk about how everyone had to act in front of a green screen, especially when they are talking to the Looney Tune cartoon characters. When Michael Jordon does the press conference and informs everyone that he is retiring and taking up baseball, well Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck snigger profusely at the announcement, in basically thinking it is a joke. Both Billy West and Dee Bradley Baker reflect when they went to the premiere of the film SPACE JAM at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and were bowled over by the brilliant colours of the animated parts of the film. Joe Pytka walks back into the room and mentions that this film would not of come about if the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit had not come out, and praises its ground-breaking concept of combining live actors with the cartoon characters. They talk about the actor Wayne Knight when he first appears in the film arriving with Michael Jordan outside his house in the beat up old car and when the film had finished Wayne had lost a lot of weight. Joe Pytka comes back into the room again and praises Michael Jordan for his contribution towards the film, despite not being a properly trained actor. Joe Pytka also gives great praise to the composer James Newton Howard for composing the music to match the Warner Bros. old style music like the used in the original cartoons. We also get a lot of technical information on how they combined the cartoons with the actors and praise the people behind-the-scene who did all the computer generated images, and also maling Looney Tune cartoons look fresh and new in style. As the credits roll up the screen, Billy West and Dee Bradley Baker say it was a great honour to be involved with the film and was hoping that SPACE JAM 2 would happen in the near future. They also praise everyone else who put a lot of very hard work towards the making of the film and how it looks. Then Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck come in again with their praise towards the film and also all the little people that were also involved with the making of the film, which Daffy Duck feels is very important. Then once again the director Joe Pytka comes back into the room to thank everyone involved with the film and that he was very proud to of been involved in the making of the film.

Special Feature: Music Video: Seal Fly Like An Eagle [1996] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:14] British artist Seal covered ""Fly Like an Eagle"" for the 1996 SPACE JAM film soundtrack, even sampling Steve Miller's original ""Space Intro""  parts in the song's chorus. We also get lots of very nice clips from the SPACE JAM film. This song version peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 13 on the UK Singles Chart and number two on the Canadian RPM 100 Chart. The single was his first top ten since 1995's ""Kiss from a Rose."" According to Seal, the executive producer of the Space Jam soundtrack, Dominique Trenier, asked him to record it. D'Angelo, who was managed by Dominique Trenier, played keyboards on the song. Seal has said that Steve Miller approved of this cover version and at one point called him ""thanking me and saying that was the best cover of the song that he had heard.""

Special Feature: Music Video: Monstars' Anthem Hit Em High [1996] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:17] This Monstars' Anthem Hit Em High is a  hip hop song performed by B-Real, Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J, and Method Man from the SPACE JAM film soundtrack. The video, was directed by Hype Williams, and is in black-and-white and features scenes from the SPACE JAM film, mostly featuring the Monstars rap singers. The rappers wore the Monstars' jerseys from the film while rapping on the basketball court. You get to see more clips from the SPACE JAM film, which to me was the best part out of this music video, as I hate and detest rapper groups like this, as I feel they are typical sexist misogynous dinosaurs of the worst kind, who just sing total crap words you can hardly understand and was a complete waste of time and should have been left on the floor of the cutting room editing facility.

Special Feature: Jammin With Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan [1996] [480i] [1.33:1] [22:32] This is basically a typical promotional video for the film SPACE JAM and is narrated by Gregg Berger and reckons it is well over 60 years we have been waiting for this film and especially seeing all the Looney Tune cartoon characters combined with the actors. Here we also get an in-depth behind-the-scenes look at the feature film SPACE JAM that shows us how they blended the live action and animation together and of course starring Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny. We get an all too brief interviews, bit despite this, it was a very welcome to hear all their comments. A welcome inclusion is the old black-and-white film of the actual Termite Terrace home where the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes animation characters were first produced. We also get to see the directors larking about and a spot with Mel Blanc. The narrator of the piece is essentially a cheerleader for the movie and its stars, and we also get to view some clips of old classic Bugs Bunny cartoons that are the most entertaining part of the whole video presentation and they include BABY BUGGY BUNNY; BEDEVILLED RABBIT; WHATS UP DOC; HARE  UM SCARE  UM; THE WILD HARE; YOU OUGHT BE IN PICTURES; THE GREY HOUNDED HARE and DUCK! RABBIT, DUCK! We also a look at some of the computer animation and special effects techniques, including Michael Jordan playing basketball with green-suited players on a green screen stage, with glimpses of production art, but this really screams for some more in-depth follow-up. At least the cramped full screen shots from the film shown here make a good argument for watching the film in widescreen. Contributors include: Ivan Reitman [Producer], Michael Jordan [Basketball Player], Danny DeVito [Actor], Chuck Jones [Cartoonist], Ron Tippe [Animation Producer], Ed Jones [CEO of Cinesite], Wayne Knight [Actor], Joe Pytka [Director] and James Newton Howard [Composer].

Theatrical Trailer [1996] [1080i] [1.78:1] [1:15] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film SPACE JAM.

Finally, if you are a massive fan of Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes cartoon characters, or just want to see how the legends performed back in their day, you will want to lace up your sneakers and hit the court for this Blu-ray disc of the film SPACE JAM [20th Anniversary Edition]. If you have siblings, the SPACE JAM is the perfect family film for all ages. On top of all that, if but you yearn for that nostalgic feeling for the clothes, music, NBA players, Bill Murray; then SPACE JAM has it all. It may not have been one of the best films you will ever see, but it is without a doubt one of the most fantastic goofy zany fun film that is had by all and you will never see here or on any outer space planet in the universe. If you haven't seen it in a while, pop it in, sit back, and relax and you won't be disappointed. Highly Recommended!
