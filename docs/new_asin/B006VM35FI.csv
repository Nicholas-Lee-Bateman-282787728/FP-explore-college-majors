8505049,5,B006VM35FI,"Spinning and turning are important skills in any form of dance, and the most common complaint of dancers is ""It makes me dizzy!"" Most instructional dance videos do not address spinning and turning directly. This video is all about spinning and turning, so it belongs in any dancer's video library. Marguerite explains things in a clear, concise and direct manner, and there is plenty of opportunity to visually see each turn and each concept demonstrated as it is taught. A sure sign of an amateur dancer is wobbly or unstable turning. As a dance instructor, I recommend this DVD to any student who would like to bring their dance turns to a higher level, and enjoy turning and it's benefits rather than avoiding it. Also love the performance on this DVD!",1354579200,2,755,4.770992366412214
8505050,5,B006VM35FI,"This instructional DVD is detailed and well done.  Both practical dance applications of whirling, spiritual(sufi)and historical information.  Did not know there was more than one way to keep from getting dizzy while spinning!  Like a good reference book, you will want to refer to this over and over again.",1354406400,,306,5.204081632653061
