8015656,4,B0001O3Y62,"this dvd is good...the bonus materials are awesome and feature actual raw game footage (as the games played on TV with announcers, crowd..etc) of great plays by the japanese players...

matsui and ichiro have many highlights here and I was impressed with so taguchi....I wish they had more shinjo highlights...they only show his world series base hit....

overall the DVD is solid and gives great all around highlights of japanese players in the Show...Hideki really shinned on this one - he has a flair for dramatic.....shows 2003 playoff and world series highlights from matsui as well as all star game highlights with ichiro, matsui, hasegawa....

good dvd",1095638400,5,659,5.140186915887851
