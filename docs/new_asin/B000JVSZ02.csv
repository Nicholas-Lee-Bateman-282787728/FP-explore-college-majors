2679607,4,B000JVSZ02,"If you want the serenity of a fish tank, with a morbid little twist - this suits the trick.

I converted it to digital, so I could use it on my tablet as a portable aquarium - and I truly enjoy it!!!

Quality is excellent; and seriously - if you've ever watched real fish, in a real tank - you're used to the repetitive nature of them.

You get a single 25 minute run, and then 5 5-minute clips with different backgrounds.

I hope you enjoy this as much as I do...",1362700800,,464,4.010869565217392
2679608,5,B000JVSZ02,"I love this DVD! It's very relaxing to watch and the ""music"" is nice for background noise - not intrusive or annoying. I can't wait to feature this video at my next Halloween party. There is a nice selection of fish - some of them with a little skin left on! I love how you can see into their skulls through their empty eye sockets. My dog even watched some of the DVD, perking up his head and ears at the fish swimming by on the TV screen. Yes, you can tell that it's all fake, but it is very well done. The scenes cycle over and over again, and there are some funny little scenes where an eel leaps out of a small cave to eat a dead fish, and the angler fish with their bright headlights are particularly entertaining. Some of the fish swim right up to the ""camera"" and so you feel like you are underwater with them. Really is fascinating!",1360972800,,841,4.134146341463414
2679609,3,B000JVSZ02,"The video has four different sections.  The graphics are good but repetitive, some of the skeletonized fish appear in all four parts with similar movements.  Skeletonized deep sea fish appear with skeletonized surface type fish.",1355270400,,228,5.485714285714286
2679610,5,B000JVSZ02,"We used this on a large screen at Halloween as part of our indoor display. Some of the little kids and afew of the older ones were so transfixed that they stopped anbd watched it at length... forgetting to keep trick or treating! Only wish it was a little longer! Will be buying several of this companies ""ZOMBIE"" features this year!",1298851200,,333,4.475409836065574
2679611,4,B000JVSZ02,"I purchased this DVD for my private Halloween Party and ran it on my 60"" TV. EVERYONE was amazed! It is like looking at a ""Dead Sea Aquarium."" The different fish, shown throughout the DVD are all skeletons and there are times you see right through the front fish's skeleton and can see other fish. This DVD is pretty cool! I am a big home haunter and also put on Halloween carnivals, with a different theme each year, for my community. Each year, I run a different DVD on a 27"" monitor. I plan on doing a Davy Jones Locker theme and this DVD is perfect! No matter what size screen you have, this DVD is well worth it!",1295740800,,617,4.19327731092437
8153343,5,B000JVSZ02,"I really like it.  Not too scary, interesting concept of swimming fish skeletons.  Great for Halloween or any time. You can play with scary music or ocean sounds.",1506988800,,162,4.75

8153346,5,B000JVSZ02,"Can't believe I'm writing a review on this, but it's worth one.  This is a stand-out among the scrolling TV screen savers that you can buy and absolutely perfect for Halloween.  I watched it through to the end - comes in segments and you can choose the background.  Not much to say about a ""screen-saver"", except this one is unique and very well done.  Worth the $20. and I'm going to use it come Halloween.",1458604800,,407,4.386666666666667

8153348,3,B000JVSZ02,"Nothing special about watching the same dead fish swim back and forth.  Although it provides 4 different scenes, they're interesting for about 3-5 minutes.  Then BORING!",1444176000,,169,5.461538461538462

8153351,5,B000JVSZ02,I've been looking for something new (video wise) for several years and stumbled on this. It was perfect and gets a great response.,1412121600,,130,4.695652173913044
