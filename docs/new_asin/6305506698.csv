1046397,4,6305506698,"This arrived as a Christmas present for my girlfriend, I was sad to find that after opening the package the DVD box is rattling a loose inside and I cant ask for a replacement only a return. So I will be ordering another one and hoping this one comes in tact, It is still unopened in the plastic wrap.

EDIT: kind of a late edit but they replaced it and all was well",1323302400,,366,4.013698630136986

1046400,4,6305506698,"I would never have expected, even with family sequels so prevalent nowadays, that anyone would think of making a movie to track the life of Rasputin's tiny sidekick in Anastasia.  I guess I'm not alone in what character traits appeal to me, however.  Interestingly enough, some days before I saw Anastasia I woke from a dream in which the villain and sidekick from Disney's Aladdin, Jafar and the parrot Iago, were floating on an abandoned raft during a nighttime lightning storm and lamenting their mistakes together.  It seemed foolish when I woke, because those characters were nothing like what my dream made them to be... but when I saw Anastasia, I was amazed at how well Rasputin and Bartok fit the bill.  I didn't think anyone else would be so charmed at how the helpful bat-like creature offered sensible advice to his evil liege even while dragging back his fallen-off body parts and displaying a general sort of affection.  What a great little guy, I thought, and what a pity he's fallen into such bad company.  It was heartwarming to see him turn to the aid of good at the end.  All that is why Bartok the Magnificent charmed me so much.  It's certainly not a sequel to Anastasia, and I'm sorry the previous reviewer was expecting it to be.  It's a spin-off, rather, for anyone curious whether that little whitebat managed to make anything of his life after abandoning his master.  What fun to see that he's pursued the life of street showman, which seems oddly appropriate.  This movie is casual and makes little effort to establish a setting, which groups it with other sequels/spin-offs and is why I give it only four stars, not five.  Chronologically, the characters shown on the Russian throne make no sense and beg the question of what happened to Princess Anastasia.  Yet, when we view this Moscow as something of an unreliable fairytale land (and the movie does follow certain tenets of fairy-tales), it seems quite believable.  Bartok is obviously the hero of his movie, and he lives up to the role well.  He is immodest, an unusual trait among genuine heroes, but it works on him.  Of especial note is the fact that while his integrity is questioned at times, hardly anyone ever points out that Bartok is quite small--so how could he make anything of himself?  Naturally, this issue itself has been explored time and again in children's movies and books, and is properly treated as a sidenote here.  For his part, Bartok is all the more inspiring by how he resourcefully makes use of the physique he has.  He is never shown doing anything unrealistic for his size or strength, and neither is there much of the inordinate luck small characters in movies like this often have in besting those larger than them.  In my opinion, that implicit honesty makes this movie a real treasure.  Bartok is more than just an amusing voice and more than just another unlikely hero--he is an inspiration for those who must confront tasks they know appear far beyond their means to carry out.  The tools at hand are determination, perseverance, and ingenuity, all of which are put fully to the test in Bartok the Magnificent, and all of which succeed.",998265600,14,3155,4.73992673992674
1046401,5,6305506698,"My very favorite Don Bluth film in all the world, and one of my favorite movies of all time, is ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"". However, I have absolutely no use for the sequel, All Dogs 2. When I sat down to watch  ""Bartok the Magnificent"", I expected the same effect. And was  pleasantly surprised!  This movie, if not handled in a very careful way,  had the potential to be ridiculous. The plot was decent, but not original  enough to loosely stand on its own. However, a few twists and turns on the  conventional storyline kept this movie interesting. My congratulations to  the screenplay writer, who managed to tell a story entertaining for kids  but could keep adults interested as well. And KUDOS to Hank Azaria and  Kelsy Grammer!  They handled their roles with excellence; I wouldn't have  enjoyed this movie at all if not for the humor they displayed in their  roles. It was a wonderful change from the usual, heart-rending dramatic  moments that are displayed in many cartoons and movies. This was simply  light and easy, keeping all entertained and laughing. Every actor and  actress was having fun with their roles, and it showed. Great, great job.  What else can I say?  Don Bluth, great job on an excellent family movie!",946425600,11,1229,4.694835680751174
1046402,5,6305506698,I got this movie thinking it was going to be one of those saturday morning cartoons and was very impressed with the quality of animation and the colors of it. It's very entertaining and funny. My kids absolutely loved  it. I hope they make another Bartok movie. He became one of my favorites  characters and my kids too.,942710400,12,320,4.5
1046403,4,6305506698,"Firstly if you're a fan of Anastasia don't feel threatened by this film!  It has nothing to do with the original, other than having Bartok as its central character, and as such its really one for Bartok fans. The film  tells the story of Bartok, a bat who really wants to be a hero but has  nothing but made-up stories of heroism to tell to the admiring street  crowds, and his quest to save the kidnapped Prince Ivan from the sinister  witch Baba Yaga, whose home is guarded by a riddling skull voiced by Tim  Curry! Hey, if its got Tim Curry in it, how bad could it be!  :-)  Has  some great lines from Bartok and good, even if not the excellent artwork  and animation of ""Anastasia"".  I think this is also the first  direct to video production made by Don Bluth, Gary Goldman and their team.",942278400,9,794,4.29054054054054
1046404,5,6305506698,"A true delight to watch.  Not since Secret of NIMH has Don Bluth been this wonderful.  A new studio at his command; one financed by Rupy's 20th Century Fox.

1046546,4,6305506698,"Let's be honest. This is not a movie which is going to blow you away, but it is a charming family film. It has great nostalgia value to me, and Bartok is a lovable protagonist in this adventure. It's a standard fairytale setup minus the romance, and it would be a great teaching model for the monomyth in a creative writing class.

If you have children that enjoy light-hearted adventures or just enjoy nostalgia for the 2D movie magic, this is a good movie to give a go.",1420416000,,471,4.3522727272727275
