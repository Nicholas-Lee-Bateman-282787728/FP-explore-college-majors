948732,5,6305012814,The protagonist of the movie is a former teacher whose face has been burnt by an unexpected accident. He lives avoiding the public's notice and one day he meets a solitary boy without father who aims at the officer school. The boy asks him to give private lessons to help him pass the entrance exam of the school. The process in which the relationship between the teacher and the student changes gradually into friendship of two men is described impressively. This is a human drama which does not seem like a movie starring Mel Gibson and it is very impressive. I thought what the true friendship is by seeing this movie.,977270400,,621,4.603603603603603
948733,5,6305012814,"Once in a while you come across a film that reaches into your heart and holds on tight. Mel Gibson's directorial debut does just this. ""Man  Without"" is a beautifully crafted film about friendship and  acceptance, set to a superb musical score by James Horner. Gibson hews a  powerful performance as a man given the chance to transcend his life of  solitude and regret, when he agrees to tutor a troubled young boy. Nick  Stahl does a fine job as the young boy who secretly studies literature with  the town ""freak"", and comes to find in his teacher the father he  never had and the friend he would always cherish. Long after the lights  have come up and the credits have finished rolling, this film stays with  you. More than just a commendable first effort, Mel Gibson's cinematic work  of art is uncomparable.",966988800,2,812,4.615384615384615

Once more, he doesn't have any recollection of his father, and  his mother refuses to divulge such secrets. His older sister, and many of  his friends think he is seriously disturbed. So he begins to question his  self worth, and begins to think he is crazy. Then he meets with resident  town freak,( Mel Gibson in his most powerful performance ever) an  ex-teacher who decides to tutor him to help him acquire his dream. The  movie teaches a valuable lesson, but doesn't come off as preachy(which is  to it's benifit) Both charachters find what they are searching for in each  other.

948737,5,6305012814,"This is the movie version of a fairly old novel written by Isabelle Holland. Gibson directs his first movie, and stars as Justin McLeod, the ""man without a face"". The story is set on a holiday island off the East coast.
Justin used to teach at a boys school. He had a tragic accident while driving one of the boys, killing the boy and becoming disfigured in the fire resulting from the crash. There are overtones about his relationship with the dead boy that are not developed in either the movie or the novel. Now he has retreated into himself, and has become the village recluse and ogre.
The gorgeous Nick Stahl plays Chuck, the fourteen year old boy who shares the stage with Gibson. Chuck needs tutoring if he's to make it into his choosen high school.
 The two begin a grudging relationship that starts with tutoring in school subjects. It progresses into a deeper relationship of mutual respect and caring. The boy comes to realize that Justin really cares for him, and will provide the love and guidance that he desperately needs.
The crisis comes when Chuck runs away from his mother and spends the night at Justin's cottage. There he is discovered by the sherrif next morning wearing only his Jockeys. While nothing untoward has happened during the night, it looks bad for the pair.
Justin is tried for assaulting Chuck. To spare the boy, he pleads guilty and is sent to jail. Most unfair!
Years later, Chuck graduates from high school, having been really helped by Justin's tutoring. Justin reappears in the background, leaving unanswered the question of the two salvaging their relationship.
It is interesting to note that this story has homosexual overtones, although very subtle one, and Gibson is, by his own statements, not gay-positive. This is the first gay theme'd movie that Gibson has appeared in.
Watch for young Nick Stahl in this movie. Not only is he a budding hunk, but he can act. He's got to be one of the better ones in the new crop of actors. I would compare him to Elijah Wood in the movie Paradiso.  END",882489600,,2035,4.665738161559888

948993,5,6305012814,"IMPRESSIVE! I loved every single scene of this film! It is even more impressive if we take in account that it was the first film Mel Gibson directed - and he immediately made a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

1968, a little town somewhere near Boston. Chuck Nordstadt (Nick Stahl), a boy about 12-years old, lives with his dysfunctional mother and his two half-sisters, an older one, Gloria, a gorgeous redhead who hates him and a younger one, Meg, who is friendly, precociously intelligent but also a little pesky. Chuck misses his father, who died in somehow mysterious circumstances and totally hates his life - he dreams of entering the military boarding school to later become a pilot but also to get away from his family. He is however a slow learner and needs desperately a tutor - and then one day he learns that the reclusive, unfriendly disfigured man living nearby, a certain Justin McLeod (Mel Gibson) is actually a former university teacher. And then the film begins.

 This is one of the BEST FILMS I saw in many years. Mel Gibson did an amazing job as director and also as actor. He very carefully adapted the original novel, changing it in some crucial aspects and I believe that he did the right thing - I am quite certain that I would hate this film if it followed closely the book. Casting was simply perfect, with young Nick Stahl giving an incredible performance, Margaret Witton being perfect as the unstable mom, Fay Masterson portraying marvellously a spiteful viper and little Gaby Hoffmann doing great as brilliant pixish Meg. The life of a little town is described with care, amusement, criticism but also some tenderness. Views are marvellous and dialogs are frequently irresistible.

I will keep this review deliberately short to avoid spoilers, because this is a film with surprises and it keeps us guessing and wondering how will it end until the very final scene. I have no words strong enough to praise it. This is a film to buy, watch, keep and re-watch. ENJOY!",1443225600,2,2036,4.7920227920227925
949030,5,6305012814,"This was a beautiful story about a boy and his teacher. It was not about a homosexual relationship, although the book it was based on was. I think Mel Gibson liked the story but is not an activist for gay rights. I think it was interesting that he would make a film about a man with a disfigured face when he was recognized as one of the most handsome men on the planet.",1438992000,,370,4.082191780821918
949031,4,6305012814,"""The Man without a Face"" was Mel Gibson's 1993 debut as director. Gibson stars in the eponymous role as McLeod, a man whose face is heavily scarred. The story takes place on coastal Maine during the summer of 1968. Several years earlier McLeod moved to the area to live in seclusion and do his unconventional work with the requisite privacy. Unfortunately, but to be expected, rumors about the mysterious recluse circulate amongst the locals, who callously refer to him as ""hamburger head."" A fatherless 12 year-old, Chuck (Nick Stahl), wants to go to a military school and therefore enlists the aid of the outcast and a good relationship develops. Margaret Whitton plays Chuck's oft-married mother while Fay Masterson and Gaby Hoffmann his half-sisters. Geoffrey Lewis is on hand as the town's police chief.

I saw this movie years ago and, despite it being a decent drama, it left a sour taste. Why? Four reasons and they all have to do with the third act: (1.) It introduces the rumor of a hideous crime where someone is falsely accused (LIKELY falsely accused) and plots like this infuriate me for obvious reasons. (2.) The crime in question is sexual molestation, which is always an uncomfortable and awkward topic, to say the least. (3.) There's a scene where a character is given the opportunity to affirm or deny the wicked allegations and he refuses; instead he answers by asking a rhetorical question. This is also frustrating. If someone didn't commit a crime then he (or she) should JUST SAY SO. (4.) Another scene struck me as stoo-pid simply because intelligent, discerning people are careful (and responsible) to make sure that what they do doesn't have the ""appearances of evil"" even though it's not evil, if you know what I mean. The character in question fails to do this and it was, again, infuriating.

Watching the film a second time, I have much higher respect for it because I now see what it's really about. The plot reveals the surface meaning  a fatherless kid finds a much-needed father-figure and a lonely outcast is blessed with human acceptance and the opportunity to fulfill his calling (teaching)  but the movie goes much deeper than this, which explains the existence of the third act and why everything else leads up to it. The subtext is a condemnation of gossipy lowlifes found in every community who destroy lives with their wicked tongues; that is, IF they're not called to account. They're judge, jury & executioners of innocent people. Their prey-of-choice is unconventional types or those perceived as a threat due to their figurative strength. Such slanderers are arrogant fools who love tearing others down, particularly those outside of their group. They feed on creating strife through lies, half-truths, negative spinning, unjust criticism, name-calling and mocking. THEY are the true monsters, not people like McLeod.

The more extreme the nature of the accusation the better, which is why these scum shoot for the most hideous of lies, such as sexual molestation. Such ignoble gossips are literally everywhere and their slander will spread and poison others' minds IF someone doesn't boldly put a stop to their lies. There's an effective scene at the end where the accused person approaches an elderly couple with whom he had a good relationship, but it's clear that the rumors had gotten to them and their minds are now poisoned because they refused to hear his defense before drawing a damning conclusion. There was nothing he could do and it's heartbreaking. Unfortunately, this kind of thing happens all the time.

While the drama of the film is solid, not great, it's the movie's subtext that breaks the threshold of greatness. The awesome coastal locations are a plus, as is the peripheral cast. While the movie's laden by the sexual molestation subplot it's justified because it ties into the picture's potent theme.

The film runs 115 minutes and was shot on coastal Maine and Nova Scotia.

GRADE: B+

***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read further unless you've seen the movie.

I've heard some seriously erroneous claims about the movie, like McLeod really did have a sexual relationship with Chuck. Nonsense. These people didn't pay attention because the movie itself thoroughly disproves such claims: First of all, there's no scene where sexual abuse is even hinted at. Secondly, when the mother asks Chuck if McLeod ""touched"" him he responds with a shrug, ""Yeah, why?"" In other words, he touched him only in appropriate ways, like a pat on the back and so forth. ""What's the big deal?"" is essentially his response. Furthermore, Chuck tries to find out the truth about McLeod upon hearing the gossip/rumors and then steals his mother's car and goes straight to McLeod's house in a frenzy to confront him. McLeod's not the type to TELL people what to believe so he asks Chuck (paraphrasing), ""Have I ever done anything remotely questionable or abusive when you were around me?"" It's a rhetorical question and the non-verbal response is ""Absolutely not."" This explains why McLeod had no worries when the police officer came to his house earlier in the story looking for Chuck after he was missing for a night. He nonchalantly responds, ""Yes, he's here; he's sleeping upstairs."" He had no worries BECAUSE nothing improper was going on. Be that as it may, their friendship ends for legal reasons and McLeod moves away, but he secretly attends Chuck's graduation 7 years later at the military school where they happily wave to each other from a distance, hardly the appropriate behavior if McLeod committed an atrocious sex crime against the youth years earlier.",1433980800,,5609,4.982905982905983

949038,5,6305012814,"I show this movie every year in my theology class because it exemplifies the relationship between faith and reason.  In order to have trust and believe in the words of another, one needs good reasons. Over a summer,  Chuck spends many hours alone with McLeod getting to know him and see if  McLeod is a deceiving person and if knows what he is talking about when it comes to teaching and friendship. The words ""Think, Norstadt, reason!""  are directed at the audience too.  Unlike the townspeople, Charles, and we, are in the best position to judge McLeod if besides the time we just spent with him, we were attentive to him and his actions.  This is the same method Jesus used with his disciples who spent the most time with him.  The apostles believed what Jesus said about Himself,not because it was self-evident, but because of the irrefutable signs that demanded trust.

But the right side, including the ear and hair, has been horribly burned and scarred. His name is Justin McLeod, but the local kids call him all sorts of horrible names. He lives alone and avoids other people for the obvious reasons.

Chuck Norstadt (Nick Stahl) is a lonely 10-year-old who lives with his much-married mother, his older half-sister and his younger half-sister. It's quite the dysfunctional family, and Mom is busy working up to her fourth or fifth marriage. Older sister Gloria simply hates Chuck, calls him a freak and stupid and all sorts of things. His younger sister Megan likes him well enough, but is enough smarter than he is that she humiliates him.

Chuck flunked the exam to get admitted to his father's old prep school, a military academy which I'm thinking is for Navy, but not sure there. So he's determined to study Latin and geometry over the summer so he can take the exam again at the end of the summer. Mom doesn't like the idea, but acquiesces.

Chuck accidentally discovers that McLeod is or was a teacher, and persuades him to tutor him in Latin and geometry. That's the center of the story, and I'm not going to spoil it with more detail than that.

One face you may recognize: Gloria's boyfriend is played by Michael DeLuise, who was Joey Penhall on 21 Jump Street. Doug's younger brother. Remember? We see him nude or nearly nude in this movie, and was he ever buffed in 1993!!!",1336780800,,1557,4.56989247311828

949229,4,6305012814,"Young Charles is the only boy who lives with his step family of females consisting of his step mother and step sisters in a quaint village in Maine in the 1960s. It is clear from the beginning of the film that the step family does not understand nor appreciate Charles's presence and as a result he longs to get out and one way is to attend his father's old boarding school. But first he has to pass the entrance exam.

In this quest, he comes across a disfigured former college professor, Justin McLeod played by Mel Gibson who lives alone in a large lake house and avoids people at every turn. Charles invites himself to be tutored by the professor in preparation for the exam as there is no one else to tutor him and therefore its the only option if he wants to take the exam.  The professor reluctantly agrees. Instead of payment for tutoring the boy, the professor makes Charles work around the house while he teaches him latin, geometry and Shakespeare.

Charles is intrigued by the professor and his disfigurement. Over time Charles becomes acquainted with the professor and learns about the auto accident that disfigured him.  As the two begin to share interests in the arts a friendship develops. Charles comes to understand that for the first time in his young life, he has found someone to love. Charles begins to see the shallowness of his step family and his friends around him as they formulate opinions about the professor based on impressions and hearsay. Charles does not tell his step mother he is being tutored by the hermit like professor that people have learned to stay away from.

It is only by chance that the boy is discovered hiking in the woods with the professor by a police officer and then the trouble starts for Justin McLeod. The step mother insists on an inquiry as to what if anything was going on between her stepson and the professor. We learn later that apparantly there was a boy about Charles's age who died in the crash that disfigured the professor's face and the professor was accused of molesting the boy but it was never proven.

The moral of the story is that for seven years Justin McLeod lived alone in that big house with his faithful dog and never bothered anyone. When he decided to get involved in another young man's life his world suddenly was intruded on but in a positive way for he made a friend but the punishment for that friendship based on his past was that the court decided he was not to see the boy ever again for the peace of mind of everyone.

This was Mel Gibson's first film as both star and director. He is terrific in conveying the essense of a man who has been rejected by the world and who has come to terms with that rejection by embracing his solitude. The supporting cast includes a very young Nick Stahl as Charles.  This is simply one of those feel good movies that include This Boy's Life and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, all produced the same year 1993 that are quite simply enjoyable for the performances, and are photographed well and each scene is rich with excellent writing that conveys the greatest of all attributes in any medium, the human condition.

949283,5,6305012814,"That's a strange film indeed. The situation is not innocuous, far from it. It cannot be considered as being a simple emotional or sentimental film, not even a social film. The stake is a lot more than that. It is a cultural film, a film about a whole culture that is being stifled, destroyed just out of bigotry, the culture of the male maturation of boys. Not even the sexual bigotry that is actually brandished to justify the rejection, and that's why it is not social or sentimental or even emotional. It is as cold as cold can be and purely cultural. It is dealing with the fundamental freedom of any child, of any man, of any woman, to dominate their lives, to choose what they want to do, who they want to love and even the way they want to love them. And the stake in the film is not even that last element since there is absolutely not one single little iota of sexuality, not even understood innuendo, between the man wand the boy. The only sexuality is between two heterosexual teenagers who are not of age. But why is that man rejected, why is that boy oppressed into severing his friendship from that man? The reasons are as ugly as any bigotry can be. First the bigotry of both men and women against any man who is not married and the father of several children. When we know the strongest criticism comes from the sheriff - whose mission that over-protective and slandering attitude may be - and from the mother who has three children from three different fathers and is raising that boy in an all-female environment with the introduction of a fourth man, husband, or whatever, to soon bring in another child probably, at least a development that might be satisfying for the mother's impulses, maybe for the daughters' impulses too who are more or less their own bosses and authorities, but a development that can only be disruptive for the son who is in that fragile moment when he needs some stability, a male presence and certainly not a mother who is multiplying her sexual partners. This film is thus a denunciation of the society that enables a mother and a sheriff to frustrate a young male teenager of the only friendly male presence he has managed to develop himself. This frustrating attitude is castrating in many ways too. And what's more it is vain because no one can get a teenager to reject and forget that friendship of his and the man will be there when he graduates, even if at a certain distance. But why is that bigotry so violent and ruthless? Mel Gibson makes it a lot more effective by making it the result of his deformed and disfigured face that was burned severely in a car accident in which a child, who was not the man's, was killed and for which he had spent three years in prison for some kind of accidental manslaughter. The local public opinion transforms it into a sexual crime that cannot be in anyway excused, especially since it never was committed. This duplicity, this obsessive fear from these people is the sign that we are sick and mad in  our own psyches, we, I mean, the normal dominant heterosexual and terroristic moralists.

Like Isabelle Holland's book on which it was based, it is a strong, poignant and excellently written coming-of-age story about a boy with a troubled family life, and yet it transcends its source material in so many ways.

Unlike the book, it is a stunning indictment of the obsessions of our times, particularly the blindness of people who refuse to believe that adult-child relationships can be non-sexual.

Poor Mel doesn't ever seem to win: everything he does is subjected to a barrage of criticism. But I am astounded that some people actually criticize the movie for not including a sexual encounter between Mel and Nick Stahl! Can you imagine the rage if he did include such a scene?

There are so many tremendous scenes, such as the depiction of McLeod's attempt at a self-portrait, but my two favourite are the devastating final encounter between McLeod and Chuck, and the ""not a trial"" scene.

949354,5,6305012814,"THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE is a quaint little drama about the deep friendship that develops between a young teenage boy and the reclusive, disfigured man who becomes his tutor.  The film stars Nick Stahl (in his feature-film acting debut) as Charles ""Chuck"" Norstadt.  Chuck lives in a broken family.  His father died when he was a boy (he doesn't remember how and no one will tell him), he has two half-sisters, and they each have different fathers because his mother has been married and divorced four times.  Charles likes his younger half-sister, but his older half-sister seems to have a deep hatred for him that at times he finds mutual.  Living in a house full of women with no male role model is tough for a boy growing into manhood.  Charles wants out and he is convinced that if he can get into the tough military academy his father went to, it will be his ticket to a better life.  The only problem is that Charles isn't the brightest kid and he's already failed the test once.  His mother gives him one last opportunity to take the test again at the end of summer.  Charles is determined to past the test, but he knows he's going to need help.

Charles eventually makes the acquaintance of a disfigured man, Justin McLeod (Mel Gibson) who lives alone at the edge of town.  Rumors abound about the man and Charles has often contributing to the mockery himself.  However, upon learning that McLeod was once a teacher at a prestigious prep school, Charles convinces him to tutor him through the summer so that he can pass his entrance exam.  McLeod begins the tutoring rather reluctantly, but he sees the potential in Chuck and gives him his all.

THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE was Mel Gibson's directorial debut.  Gibson did a good job and the experience in the film seems to have been a turning point in Gibson's career.  THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE is a smaller movie, yet it shares many of the same universal themes that Gibson explores in all of his directed feature films (so far) and many of his starring roles since 1993.  The theme that stands out most in the movie is grace.  Towards the end of the movie McLeod tells Charles how he taught him and showed him grace.  Charles' life oozes grace and he doesn't even realize it.  By the same token, McLeod displays grace towards Charles, too.

I enjoyed THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE the first time I saw it several years ago.  However, now I enjoy it even more.  When I first saw the film, I identified with Charles, but having returned to school and become a teacher myself, I now relate more to McLeod.  In the movie, their relationship illustrates the type of relationship that should exist between every instructor and pupil, something that happens infrequently in American society.

As a side note, I have not read the book that THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE is based upon.  I've been told that the book dabbles with and suggests that the relationship between the two main characters was based on sexuality.  The film does not suggest that at all (though accusations of that sort are key points in the movie) and instead illustrates how a healthy friendship between adults and older children can be.

The DVD includes a trailer for the movie as well as a short featurette about the making of the film entitled REMEMBERING THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE.  The featurette is brief, but it includes comments from both Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl discussing how the movie changed their lives.  For a short featurette, it's actually very informative.",1169078400,6,3476,4.595779220779221

Stahl is perfect as the young boy whose need for a true father figure propels him to seek Gibson's guidance in preparing for his acceptance into a boarding school.  The usually daft Margaret Whitton offers an understated and effective performance as his oft-married mother and Gaby Hoffman is good as his young stepsister.

949361,3,6305012814,"I've loved this film for ages, and although it's not as good as Braveheart, or some other of Mel Gibson's movies (where he's not shown constantly chain smoking), it's still worth having. I have to complain about my shoddy DVD, as I'm sure it's a pan & scan one, as I could move the screen about, and lose/gain some parts of the scene. Either that or I'm just discovering new buttons to press on my DVD remote.

I also love Nick Stahl in this movie, he's not the greatest looking kid to watch (although he's grown up to be quite nice looking), but he draws you into the character, and it's really good to watch.

I've always wanted to read the book, but have never found it here in the UK. It sounds very interesting, as Justin McLeod was homosexual in the book, and there is a much bigger relationship than shown in the film - but obviously Mel Gibson didn't want to include this, maybe fearing it would be too much? There are still some undertones of the Chuck's sexuality in the film, but you have to look hard to see them, and maybe read between the lines a bit.

I love the whole family around Chuck too, his mum (Margaret Whitton), older sister (Fay Masterson), and younger sister. Gaby Hoffman was brilliant as his young bra-burning, feminist sister, whatever happened to her? She's been in Now & Then, Sleepless in Seattle, this, and then she's disappeared off the face of the earth. She's changed a lot however.

There's some shocking scenes in this, including Mel Gibson's topless scene where he shows off his character's burns to their full extent, and the way Justin is treated when the story begins to pick up speed.

I never got the start of the movie, which basically opens into a dream, but connects to the scene at the end of the movie. And it was stupid having a completely different looking actor take over Nick Stahl's part at the end of the movie.

Though the nearly 2 hour film starts slow, I continued to watch.  Set in the late 1960's, the injustice served in this film is probably even more so in today's society.  Intolerable justice which leads to a painful closing; maybe bittersweet for others.  No tears, just pain.  Like other films I have watched and in some cases reviewed (watch L.I.E. or Eban and Charley for alternate viewpoints and storylines), this one deals with the bond between a man and a young boy - in this case, a boy seeking the guidance, knowledge and friendship of someone older and wiser.  The child, Charlie is from a broken family (divorced mother, nagging sisters and an alcoholic father now deceased), Charlie seeks a way to gain acceptance into a boarding school.  In doing so, he seeks out and befriends a disfigured man (played by Mel Gibson).  As mentioned, a slow start that keeps you tuned in and eventually has you hooked.  The ending hurts, and shows us once against how bigotry and circumstance continue to shield justice on our country - then, as it does now.  I would rather not share the twisted plot that results.  I would refer to this film as a sleeper, and one I very much enjoyed, and yet knew nothing about before watching.

NOTE: After writing this review, I received an email from an avid reader (of which I am not).  I have since learned the the film adaption of the book is NOT a true portrayal.  In the book, the disfigured character was, in fact, gay.  He & the teenager have a sexual relationship (although it is only tastefully referred to & not depicted).  Based on this blatant change of context, Mr. Gibson apparently was more interested in making big Hollywood money, or has some personal issues with the story line...I'm sure that is the subject of forums elsewhere.

Once more, he doesn't have any recollection of his father, and his mother refuses to divulge such secrets. His older sister, and many of his friends think he is seriously disturbed. So he begins to question his self worth, and begins to think he is crazy. Then he meets with resident town freak,( Mel Gibson in his most powerful performance ever) an ex-teacher who decides to tutor him to help him acquire his dream. The movie teaches a valuable lesson, but doesn't come off as preachy(which is to it's benifit) Both charachters find what they are searching for in each other. The resoloution is visually stunning and touching. It proves that someone you've known for only a short time can impact you for the duration of your life.",1028419200,20,952,4.6726190476190474
949438,4,6305012814,"Mel Gibson stars as a man who is hiding from a past that haunts him. In this, his directoral debut, he displayed that he was serious about his new found profession and announced that he was here to stay. Nick Stahl star's as a young boy with darkness in his own past. After having trouble at school, he gathers up all of the bravery he can muster to ask the reclusive hermit, known to the locals as ""Hamburger Head"", if he will help him with his school work. After much hesitation, Mcleod (Gibson) gives in. The first lesson he gives the boy is digging a hole, and you can guess how much the boy likes that.
The Man without a Face explores the deep relationship that can be shared after a man has been hurt, and a boy looses his father. Both of them have secrets, and both quickly develop a bond. Its one of Gibson's finest movies.
The only problem I had with the movie, was the predictable situation that the movie places Gibson and the Boy in near the end. I don't want to spoil it, but it would have been more enjoyable and less formulaic if they hadn't gone in that direction. Besides that small detail, all of the plot surrounding the incident is terrific, worth your time, and your tissues. If you want to study Nick Stahl in his other movies, he can be found in MTV'S ""Wasted"", and the great shocker ""Bully"". Also, he has a cameo (like everybody else) in ""The Thin Red Line.""",1018828800,,1382,4.319230769230769
949439,4,6305012814,"First-time director Mel Gibson is Justin McLeod, a reclusive somebody or other of a picturesque New England town.  Mcleod has wisdom beyond his years, but disfigurement after a horrific accident has cut him off from the wise, but beautiful inhabitants of his small town.  In the late 1960's, young Charles Norstadt (Nick Stahl) has come here in the tow of his mother and two step-sisters - one a supportive one, the other demanding, malicious and inwardly jealous for the love of their mother, both intellectually above him.  Chuck chafes not only under the bile of sister-Gloria, but also under his mother's drowning love, both of which - he is sure - will rob him of his chance to follow in his late father's vaguely glorious footsteps.  He is actually his own greatest obstacle - more accurately a learning disability that has him look blank-faced through the flick.  Hoping to triumph over the odds, Chuck applies to an exclusive military academy, and turns to McLeod for help in passing the rigorous entry process.  Reluctant to have any contact, McLeod breaks down and not only helps the boy, but shares a confidence which will tie the two and, when Chuck accidentally fails to keep it under wraps, force McLeod back into the open.  It will also force Chuck to examine who his father really was.  While McLeod is merely disfigured, it's Chuck's deceased father who is really faceless victim alluded in the title.  ...
For his first directing job, this was actually an exemplary flick, but it suffers because it's not clear who the flick is supposed to be about.  Gibson keeps the focus off of his own character, probably afraid he'd accidentally turn the film into a vanity piece, but he doesn't really beef up Charlie's character either.  Charlie has a low threshold for fear and pain, and he falls into a fugue whenever it's hit (mostly, the film will cut without interval to show Charlie in a trance-like state).  Frankly, I couldn't see the homosexual undertones arising from anything more than the narrow-mindedness of Charlie's self-righteous neighbors.  Surprisingly, the main characters and the script cater shamelessly to such right-wing fantasies as evil, domineering females (Charlie is the sole male in a house of hyper-intelligent women who ruthlessly and callously victimize him, not allowing his attention-deficits to hold them back) while Charlie's mother surrounds herself with wealthy and left-leaning intellectual friends, the very picture of elitist liberals that conservatives love to hate.  The town's upper-crust eastern liberals, though tossing back their martini's with pseudo-intellectual aphorisms about Vietnam and ""imperialistic, post-Hegelian, authoritarian crap"" of the stablishment ruthlessly show their own true face when they realize that McLeod is now a target for suspicion.  The opening scene is a fantasy - of Chuck's triumphant graduation from Military School - one his freely acknowledges as ""John Wayne meets Hugh Hefner"".  Whether you buy into the fantasy or not, it's the only one the script delves into, and it strips of everybody of much of their face.  Charlie himself doesn't so much learn to see the true face of those around him, as have the truth thrust in his face.  It's painful, and a bit of a botch of a movie, but still one you should catch anyway.",1014940800,3,3309,5.0626151012891345
949440,4,6305012814,"It took me a long time to rent this movie because it didn't seem like it had much action and I loved to watch Gibson shoot, hack, stab, etc.  After all, Mel Gibson is an American Action Hero, bigger than life and one of the Hollywood's greatest men of action.
I wasn't the least bit disappointed in this film, it is very good.  The story of a young man (yes it is a coming of age film) spending his summer in a resort town on an island with one strange citizen that the townspeople love to gossip about.  The young man and recluse meet and become fast friends.  The mentor and student are plunged into a crisis when false assumptions are made and the hero of the story must make the moral decision to put the welfare of his friend ahead of his own.
It is a compelling and heart felt story, and while it offers little in the way of action and adventure, it is well worth watching.",1005350400,3,879,4.183431952662722

949442,5,6305012814,"Mel Gibson's first time directing is notably successful. The Man Without A Face is warm movie with themes touching prejudice, the relationship between teacher and student, and faces of deception. Chuck Norstadt is a young boy whose mother's capricious relationships have sent her skimming through multiple marriages and developing a considerable deal of tension at home. The dysfunctional family leaves Chuck desperately looking for companionship. He finds an unlikely friend, the town's ""freak,"" Justin McLeod (Gibson), who had half his face horribly scarred in a car accident. McLeod lives in a big house on the coast as a lonely hermit whose past is shrouded in ugly rumors and fear.
McLeod becomes Chuck's tutor and his friend, although Chuck will do some teaching of his own. They both realize they have a lot to learn about each other, and their friendship develops into something stirring and honest. Things get complicated when vile rumors and intolerance threaten to separate them, though.
The script is smart, and Gibson's direction guides this film with a discerning knack for emotional lucidity and realism. Nick Stahl (as Chuck) is one of the few young actors who can do emotional expression that doesn't seem forced and stupid. This is critical, because bad casting for Chuck would seriously have ruined this movie. Gibson, of course, is great here, but what would you expect? He's a tremendously versatile actor. I do think the movie probably should have been about 10 minutes longer to flesh out the ending a bit. That's not a huge complaint...the last scene in the movie makes up for any disappointment because it is very moving and evocative in its simplicity. Ahh...truly an excellent movie.",989712000,31,1710,5.132616487455197
949443,5,6305012814,"Mel Gibson does justice to a wonderful story (based on the novel by Isabelle Holland) in ""The Man Without a Face,"" his directorial debut.  Commonly underrated as an actor because of his good looks and blockbuster action hits, Gibson is also terrific as the scarred recluse Justin McLeod, cantankerous and charismatic by turns.  Like his student, Chuck (Nick Stahl), we notice the terrible burns less and less as the friendship between the boy and his tutor develops, as we penetrate the surface to the beauty beneath.  (By the way, as one reviewer noted, only one half of McLeod's face has been disfigured - the title refers, not to McLeod, but to Chuck's absent father.)
I do wonder why Gibson chose to eliminate the homoerotic overtones in their relationship - in the novel, Chuck's yearning for a genuine father figure is inextricably entangled with his confusion regarding his sexual identity and attraction to his tutor, and these twin needs force the dramatic climax that ends their time together.  Perhaps Gibson preferred to keep the plot simpler, concentrating on the themes of prejudice, the joy of teaching, and the friendship and platonic love that his protagonists learn from each other.  Or perhaps he feared that his viewing audience would not be as sympathetic towards a homosexual McLeod who killed a previous pupil in a drunk driving accident.  Some reviewers appear to feel that the movie did not end as well as it began, and I think this could well be chalked up to the Hollywood sanitization of the last third of Holland's book.
Still, this is a quietly splendid first film for director Gibson -  a moving tribute to the transformative power of friendship and a funny, sometimes painful coming-of-age story expertly combined.",979430400,22,1746,4.979381443298969
949444,5,6305012814,"This movie was set in New England in the late sixties, but it could have been set at anywhere and any time with equal effect. What i took from this movie was an appreciation for education, friendship and loyalty. I think that we all have had a favorite teacher that inspired us and we could relate to.  This movie is about a man that lived alone and struggled with a lot of guilt, with physical and emotional scars but had a rare chance to redeem himself as an educator, and a man, in a conformist affluent town that mocks and ridicules him because he has aweful scars on his face.  MR McCloud (Mel Gibson) happened across a boy who needed help, both academically and otherwise, and made a man out of a boy, while helping to make the troubled boy's dreams all come true. The acting was impeccable, and the story was very touching.  I love this movie and recommend it to anyone, if you are willing to risk a tear. Great job to Mel Gibson and thanks for a touching movie.",978048000,3,969,4.313186813186813
