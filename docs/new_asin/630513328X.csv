972435,5,630513328X,This DVD is simply wonderfull . All the selection is under the most irish music spirit . Great .,1167782400,4,96,4.105263157894737
972436,5,630513328X,"If you liked the music of Riverdance, check this out. It's the Real Thing. The Chieftains, aling with the Boys of the Lough (not here) and DeDanannn started the Irish Trad Music revival. Christy Moore does the same for vocals. Mary Black is Etheral! Leahy (a family) with the Chieftains is superb! I have no idea why Emmy Lou Harris is introducing this show but she's onlt there at the beginning. I LOVE this DVD! No talk. Just LOTS of great music with great camera work!",1155859200,11,471,4.488372093023256
972437,5,630513328X,"I just loved this - wonderful introduction to some of Ireland's greats. I agree with the other reviewers who asked, ""When's part 2 coming out?""  Would love to have Altan and the Corrs grace the stage, as well! Some songs in Irish would be wonderful, too! BUY THIS!! You won't regret it.",1116115200,,286,4.5
972438,5,630513328X,"This is probably the first time I rented a DVD and absolutely HAD to buy it (in fact, I almost told Netflix I'd broken it and paid the fine!).  Incredible music, fantastic staging, and a much broader variety that might be expected.  Highlights for me included The Chieftains (always!), De Dannan, Mary Black, and the incredible grouping singing ""Hard Times,"" my favorite track on the DVD.  If you enjoy Irish music, or just good music in general, this is a must-have!",1089849600,2,467,4.7407407407407405
972439,5,630513328X,"Ireland is such a small island to put out the world's best music and best influenced music as its people moved about this world. Most all the groups are very traditional along with some new touches and thank goodness no U2, sorry.  The almighty Chieftains play MC to this Gale Force concert and play with a few of the acts such as Leahy, these brothers and sisters of instruments & dance will blow you away as will Ashley MacIsaac's fiddle playing & kick- thank you Canada. Sharon Shannon's accordion and band is like Irish jazz and Altan never fail to amaze me.  Stop me now or I will keep going!  Yes it is too bad that Natalie MacMaster, The Saw Doctors, Young Dubliners and several other greats are missing, I guess we need a Gaelic Woodstock for this, but there is more than enough here for a great concert.  I have the DVD and its 5.1 DD sound is all that it is supposed to be and the camera work is perfect as well.  If you are looking for a very well rounded Gaelic Concert with a touch of newness then you've got it in Gale Force, find out where America got its foundation for its country music.  Now, where is part two!?  I also recommend The Chieftains DVD ""Water from the Well"", see great shots of Ireland and great music from all facets.  See these old but young at musical heart guys play in churches, bars, civic halls, etc.; this is not a concert but all the songs are played live in whole in-between great words of wisdom. Hope this helps you out.",1038960000,8,1464,4.317518248175182
972440,5,630513328X,"I ordered this mainly for the Mary Black performance of ""Song for Ireland,"" but I have to tell you, there are so many high points, from Christy Moore's rendition of ""Hills of Donegal"" straight through to Sinead O'Connor's ""He Moved Through the Fair,"" that it's useless to try to point them all out.
  Order it...sit back...and enjoy!

Brilliant performances all round but especially from Mary Black, De Danann, Brian Kennedy and Maura O'Connell. The atmosphere in The Point is great as always.

7883836,5,630513328X,"I used to have this on video and would watch it often. I was very pleased to be able to buy it again on DVD from you. The production of this performance has been well put together with the talented artists showcased in an excellent stage setting. I really enjoy the relaxed environment created by the artists and production staff which gives the feeling of a true Irish get together and party. They do know how to enjoy themselves with the focus on historical 'Hard Times' The product is excellent and the service was great  and I recommend dealing with Amazon to my friends and family. Thank you once again.

7883837,4,630513328X,I saw this video a decade ago on a PBS fund drive and the desire to see it again stayed with me.  Some songs are dog meat but there is no denying the talent and energy of several performers.  If you want to broaden your horizons and you like Irish music definitely purchase this disk.,1304380800,,284,4.1454545454545455

I saw this for the first time on PBS during a fund raiser, and it was constantly interrupted by pledge pleas.  I've wondered for years if I could ever find a copy, and here it is!  This is a marvelous condensation of a week-long celebration of Irish music in Dublin featuring some of the best contemporary (as of 1997) performers.  Along with some of my favorites, the program includes bands and individuals with whom I was not familiar - and who joined my list of favorites as a result of their appearances here.

I can't put the disk in the player without watching three tracks in particular.  The Canadian family band Leahy plays with the Chieftains with such unbridled energy that one feels exhausted when they're finished.  The nine brothers and sisters play a charging medley in B minor that finishes with one of the girls leading off with a hard shoe volley and the rest of the siblings joining her three and four at a time.  By the end it sounds like they're about to make the roof collapse, and the applause as they take a bow is even more deafening.  Like another reviewer, I bought this disk largely on the strength of my memory of Christy Moore's ""City of Chicago"".  For years I've been wandering around singing the chorus - the only part of the song I could remember - and hoping I could hear him sing it again.  Apart from the sheer power of his words about the Great Famine in 1847, the amount of music he creates with his single guitar and his affecting voice is amazing.  Near the end fiddler Ashley MacIsaac plays ""Tullochgorum"" with the Chieftains.  He looks stark, raving, barking mad and from his facial expression the music seems to be ripping from his very soul, but his ability is phenomenal and flawless.  The crowd goes as mad as Ashley looks when he starts step-dancing without breaking stride in his incredibly energetic playing.

The most frustrating thing about Gael Force for me is that it is a condensation.  I would dearly love to see the full performances from Sharon Shannon, Altan, De Dannan, and some of the others.  I had never seen Eleanor Shanley, but I loved her a cappella performance of ""Still I Love Him"", the Irish lament of the devotion of a wife to her neglectful and emotionally abusive husband.  She clutches her silent guitar all through the song, and her voice is so powerful that I found myself wishing that I could see the rest of her set.  Afro Celt Sound Machine delivers a wonderful blend of the two styles of music and left me wanting more as well.

Some of the tracks seem somewhat out of place.  Brian Kennedy is an Irish singer who is simply doing American rhythm and blues - fine for what it is, but a little anomalous for a program of mostly traditional and folk-based music.  Sinead O'Connor has a strong voice and one of her songs, ""He Moved Through the Fair"", is traditional.  Her version is a little louder and shriller than I like - I'm used to hearing the song sung in a low, quiet delivery - but it's evocative nonetheless.

This is simply my assessment based on my personal tastes.  Others will enjoy these passages as much as I did those mentioned above.  I recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys Celtic music.",1203638400,,3194,4.532286212914485
7883841,5,630513328X,"My sisters and I grew up listening to the Clancy Brothers at my Irish grandparents' place and I've loved Irish music ever since. I remember my (Irish speaking) grandmother lining us girls up and trying to teach us to jig (she despaired at our posture but we were enthusiastic!) This DVD is terrific! I immediately recognized a few of the old songs (""Still I love him"" and ""Song for Ireland,"" both beautifully sung by Eleanor Shanley and the great Mary Black respectively) and some of the artists, as well (The Chieftains and Christy Moore.) I've always had mixed feelings about Irish fiddling (I cracked up when I learned the Russian word for violin - talk about an onomatopoeia: ""skreep-ka!"") but the fiddling on this DVD is superb - full of energy and life! So many great artists! Definitely get this one!",1202169600,,807,4.7304964539007095
7883842,4,630513328X,"There are some things I'll never understand. Gael Force was a week long extravaganza of some of the most talented Celtic artists on the planet.  From over 21 hours of content, the producers chose to capture 100 minutes of it on DVD?!

Still, THERE ARE TEN PERFORMANCES (of 24 total) THAT WILL POSITIVELY ASTOUND YOU, and that's not an overstatement. They alone are worth this DVD's purchase price.  The remainder are all solid - nothing you'll ""fast forward"" through.  And you'll probably watch this DVD a few times each year, for a very long time to come.

I can heartily recommend it to ANYONE, regardless of musical tastes. I have shared Gael Force with MANY friends, who have immediately ordered their own copy.  You will NOT be disappointed!",1195948800,,746,4.7890625
