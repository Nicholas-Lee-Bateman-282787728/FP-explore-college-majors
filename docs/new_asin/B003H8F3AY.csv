4124430,5,B003H8F3AY,"Jodie Markell has created a period piece with timeless appeal!  This never-before produced screenplay by Tennessee Williams came to light at the right time and in the right hands.  Markell's insightful direction and Bryce Dallas Howard's brilliant performance transport the viewer to 1920's Memphis with its juxtaposition of high-class southern charm, architecture and posh parties to the inner turmoil brought about through the accompanying societal expectations.  Howard's portrayal of a ""fallen"" southern belle, Fisher Willow, is both heartbreaking and breathtaking.  The high-value teardrop diamond earring she wears which is lost represents Willow's desperate struggle to hold onto her inheritance at all costs -- monetary and personal.  The viewer is seamlessly transported into Willow's world of truth vs. lies, genuine vs. fake, awake vs. asleep... as she is forced to face her past and present demons on the journey of discovering her true self (and true love, ie Chris Evans) in the process. You don't have to be a Tennessee Williams fan to get swept away by this film!",1283558400,25,1079,5.398809523809524
4124431,5,B003H8F3AY,"Tennessee Williams is the heart, mind, and voice of the South, and Jodie Markell has made an extraordinarily beautiful film of his screenplay, ""The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond.""  Exquisite in its detail and dramatic force, the director does not shy away from Williams's view of a rotting, decadent, romantic Gothic Southland.  And in Bryce Dallas Howard (with alabaster skin and raven-black hair) and Chris Evans, she has possibly the most handsome cinematic-couple since Dame Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift in ""A Place in the Sun.""
This film is a great achievement, not to be missed.",1282780800,32,590,5.135416666666667
4124432,2,B003H8F3AY,"""The Loss of a Teadrop Diamond"" is being marketed as a ""lost"" play/screenplay by Tennessee Williams, although it was not so much lost as half-forgotten.

And honestly, I'm sure Williams would have preferred that it stay half-forgotten. While Jodie Markell does her best to bring to life a world of Southern mansions, debutantes and 1920s jazz bands, the movie drags like a ballgown train in a mud puddle -- and while Bryce Dallas Howard does a great job with her thin character, Chris Evans is just DREADFUL.

To stay in her elderly aunt's good graces (and will), Southern flapper Fisher Willow (Howard) has agreed to debut in the city of Memphis, even though most of the people hate her for something her father did. So she recruits Jimmy Dobyne (Chris Evans), a poor young man with an alcoholic father and insane mother, to be her escort to the various parties. So she buys a tuxedo for him and trots him out every evening.

Additionally, she borrows her aunt's teardrop diamond earrings (for herself, not Jimmy!). But when she and Jimmy arrive at a Halloween party, Fisher discovers that one of her earrings is missing -- and when she cluelessly asks if it could have fallen into his pocket, he understandably thinks that she's implying that he stole it. Naturally, the rift between them threatens their budding romance.

""The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond"" has all the hallmarks of a Tennessee Williams story (booze, drugs, melancholy, the South, madness and a woman half-broken by the world) and probably would have made an excellent short film... say, half an hour or so. But since the actual film is about an hour and a half long, it's a swampy, slow-moving affair with lots of deadwood that should have been cut away.

Director Jodie Markell does a pretty good job with the atmosphere -- big half-decayed Southern mansions, misty lakes, luxurious ballrooms and wild places dripping with Spanish moss. Sadly, she sticks closely to the original clunky dialogue -- which is NOT Williams' best or even middling work (""I'm poor, you're poor. And that's hard, 'specially for a beautiful girl. But you got a moral decision to make!"").

And as the seemingly endless party grinds slowly by, we're treated to lots of scenes seem to have been inserted just to prop up the sagging storyline (Fisher visiting a paralyzed opium addict... what was this scene for?). Most embarrassing of all is a scene where Fisher chugs some opium-laced ""medicine"" and takes a trippy walk around the grounds, mumbling about having been in a mental hospital.

It also doesn't help that the characters of Fisher and Jimmy are pretty unappealing -- I couldn't muster up enough interest in Fisher to care what happened to her and Jimmy. The saving grace is that Howard is a simply brilliant actress, and she almost distracts us from the fact that Fisher is a greedy, rude, self-absorbed brat, and I couldn't find myself caring about people being mean to her. And Evans just stands around like an upright log, looking confused and drawling in a strained ""Suthun"" accent.

""The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond"" has moments of beauty and a brilliant actress, but it feels like a short film was stretched out over an hour and a half. Not Williams' best work.",1278979200,5,3219,4.808318264014466

4124436,5,B003H8F3AY,"Spectacular, more modern, interpretation of his work. The leads were wonderful and understood the material. There is no writer closer to the human, flawed, tender heart than Williams. His experience is that of his own era and location so many may not understand it in this generation, but it doesn't lose it's validity. He tends to write his female characters more deeply and obviously close to mental illness, while his male characters  are not as detailed, and seem to act as simply catalysts for the female exposure. Knowing some of his personal history makes the study of his written expression quite interesting. Compare this with some of his work using Elizabeth Taylor, Geraldine Page, Carol Baker. Paul Newman seems to be the only man he writes with depth. Even Cliff Montgomery is explained through Elizabeth Taylor's part as his companion, who was isolated by Cliff's mother so the truth couldn't be revealed.  Women always drive his stories, They are always impaired by the truth, the inner need to reveal the truth, and those attempts to hide it ( physically, chemically, emotionally) by themselves and others. Williams was a Master of his own genre, so understanding him as well as an inability to relate to his work as dated are both legitimate ways of trying to understand his gifts.",1498608000,3,1298,4.9495412844036695

4124439,2,B003H8F3AY,"Bryce Dallas Howard acted circles around Chris Evans who did not display one modicum of facial change or expression throughout the entire movie.  Really, it was as though his face was paralyzed in one permanent position.  In fact, it seemed as though Bryce overacted a bit to attempt to compensate for Chris' lack of acting skills.  The story itself was interesting, but it didn't translate from a book to a movie as well as it could have.  Plus, the storyline of purposely giving an overdose of pils to an older person is somewhat disturbing.  So, unfortunately, I cannot recommend what I had hoped was going to be a great movie.",1497571200,,630,4.6909090909090905

4124449,2,B003H8F3AY,"Actually, I found the story rather confusing and boring. Williams creates some crazy Southern women without explaining exactly why they are crazy.  In this case, we are told the young woman had been in psychiatric care in Europe but we don't know why.  If her condition had something to do with her father's behavior, there is a lapse in the time factor.  The film opens with her father having a dam blown up which floods land and causes loss of jobs and farm land. She appears next after her time in Europe demanding a young man become her escort.  The young man's father is the grandson of a former governor but he is reduced to alcoholism and managing a commissary but we don't know why.  The young man's mother is in a mental institution but we don't know why.  I don't even understand the importance of the diamond because the young woman is willing to leave it behind at the party.",1484265600,,887,4.478260869565218

4124455,5,B003H8F3AY,Tennessee Williams.....what more to say but it was well acted,1483315200,,61,5.2
4124456,5,B003H8F3AY,"Tennessee Williams had the market on heart wrenching stories set in the south long before our beloved Mr. Nicholas Sparks. Mr. Williams excelled in setting up characters that were deeply troubled on many levels, due to his own upbringing being just as troubled and turbulent. His characters probably due to their many flaws, are always scrambling and scratching to piece themselves and those around them back together in a semblance that only they can understand the design. Due to the deep rooted longings and misguided intentions, there are always conflicts of social, and personal natures.

The Loss Of A Teardrop Diamond is no exception to the rules of Williams creations. Though lesser known, it is delightfully created in this film with talent, purpose, craft, thought, and design. Chris Evans and Bryce Dallas Howard dared to take on these unknown roles by a giant of an author. It would be like taking on a lesser or unknown Edgar Allan Poe, such as Stonehearst Asylum (2014), which is also brilliant. Chris Evans', Jimmy Dobyne, is tragically holding on to the fraying bits of his family's honour, and trying to keep the slivers of pride he still has intact by his good deeds. Which keep being undone by the misdeeds of his alcoholic father, and mother who resides in a deplorable state run asylum. He has been ""chosen"", shall we say, by Bryce Dallas Howard's, Fisher Willow, to accompany her as her escort through the social season. Fisher is an outcast in the area due to (in no particular order) her European education; her readiness to speak her mind with a waspish tongue; her more 'forward' or 'modern' thinking while living in the midst of the deep south; and the worst offense, her father's actions of flooding land that took the lives of men the year before.

It is obvious from the opening scene our Fisher is a lost soul, another Stanley Kowalski, stumbling through day to day life. Then she has to worm her way into the attention of Jimmy, at least enough to get him to escort her through the season. Fisher's aunt holds the strings to a pretty sizable inheritance, and insists on Fisher completing a debutante season, therefore enter Jimmy, the grandson of a previous governor we learn. Through the many parties they fumble and bumble, with Fisher growing increasingly attached. Whereas Jimmy is as pragmatic as the beginning. Then we come up on Halloween night, and a party that blasts it all to bits. Old romances get a new blaze, gossiping socialites there to criticize your every gesture, mysterious relations with tantalizing confessions and petitions, and (gasp) the loss of a $5,000 teardrop diamond earring. With all that going on, who has time to spike the punch? The way the characters fight and grapple their way free is similar to watching a car crash on the highway, but seeing it all the way through, till they haul the cars away, clinging, and leaving bits behind. The frame still holds its dignity, but there is something that will never be the same.

The film from cinematography to acting, at times has a quiet, still, patient quality to it. And then has a gritty, desperate hunger, clawing at you. Those are the earmarking's of a Tennessee Williams piece. Something that makes you thankful for what you have, and frightened of what you can lose. A story that shines the light on a little corner of the grime of what humanity can offer, and the hope that stands side-by-side. He is simply amazing with being honest.",1483056000,5,3455,4.803361344537815
4124457,2,B003H8F3AY,I normally like Tennessee Williams plays but this one was not very good.  Never really clear who the characters were and why I should care about any of them.

4124474,2,B003H8F3AY,"Love Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Evans.  They are both heartbreakers but not my favorite film or performances by them.  Typical Tennessee Williams story line with lots of inner turmoil and social pressure, just too much of nothing as far as I am concerned.  Didn't come together but I get the gist of it just; seems to leave the characters under developed for my tastes.  I do applaud the drawing in of Fischer Willow where you root for her but then she falls back into character and continues in her detached ways.  The climactic scene at the party was so over written and over played when the camera closes in on her playing the piano in what was supposed to be her breaking down was just no feeling with it or caring what happens by that point.  I wonder if that was the director or the acting or both.  Since I know both Howard and Evans can deliver a deeper gut wrenching performance I tend to think this was the director.  But then again this is Williams with minimal dialogue and skimming the characters where the reader/audience is supposed to connect on their own.",1477699200,,1075,4.505154639175258

4124526,4,B003H8F3AY,"After reading John Lahr's biography, ""Tennessee Williams: Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh"" (2014), I became so interested in Williams that I read or reread many of his works and watched several of the movies his writings inspired. I have posted reviews of many of Williams' works here on Amazon. At the time I read Lahr and explored Williams, I was unaware of Williams' screenplay, ""Loss of a Teardrop Diamond"" and of the film that resulted in 2009.  Lahr does not mention the work in his book. Williams wrote ""Loss of a Teardrop Diamond"" in 1957, and the script was either forgotten or deemed not worth pursuing. At about the same time, Williams wrote another original screenplay, ""Baby Doll"" which became a film infamous in its day under the direction of Elia Kazan.

It is fortunate that Williams' screenplay has been preserved and filmed. Those who love or are interested in Williams' writing will have this movie to see which otherwise would have been lost. It is unlikely that this screenplay will be filmed again in the foreseeable future, and this movie is a more than good ---  in fact it is a fine rendition that does the script credit.  The film was independently produced and the product of several years' effort. A young Jodie Markell directed the movie with Bryce Dallas Howard in the leading role of the young socialite, Fisher Willow, and Chris Evans playing the role of her escort, Jimmy Dobyne V, the grandson of a former state governor whose family has fallen on hard times. The film received mostly negative reviews when it was released in 2009 and did not play in many theaters. I think it will have staying power.

The movie is set in the Mississippi Delta in 1923 and was filmed entirely in Louisiana.  The period settings are beautiful and convincing and include poor hardscrabble fields, lush mansions, and jazz clubs. The accompanying film score of jazz, pop, ragtime, and a bit of classical piano adds to the story and the setting. Both the leads could have brought more passion to their roles, but their characters and their stories come through. Supporting actress Ellyn Burnstein offers a highly dramatic, brief performance is an opium-addicted, dying elderly woman.

In the story, Fisher Willow is a highly wealthy, educated, independent young woman who is shunned by her society because of the reckless actions of her father and because of her own high spirits. She hires young Jimmy to be her escort at social events.  Jimmy's father is an alcoholic and his mother is institutionalized. Fisher wants Jimmy to be more than her escort to parties, but he resists her advances. At a fashionable Halloween party, Fisher loses an expensive diamond earring. The loss of the teardrop diamond becomes the occasion for Fisher and Jimmy to sort out what will be the nature of their relationship.  The film shows Williams' treatment of the South with its decadence, sexual undertones, and repressions. There are scenes of illicit sexuality, drug use, and extensive alcohol use. The movie captures a feeling of place and sadness and of the search for love and meaning characteristic of Williams' writing. The pacing is a little slow in places, but the script is Williams' and the movie is effective.

This is a small screenplay and film and would never be confused with a major work of Williams. Small slight things can still be beautiful as for example a Scarlatti sonata, a Schubert song, or a teardrop diamond earring. This is  a lovely film in its story and atmosphere.. It is delicate and intimate and repays close attention. As with so much of Williams, the characters are frail underneath their exteriors.  This is a fragile work, but it is successfully done, and moving.  I was grateful for the opportunity to see this film here on Amazon Instant Video. The quality of the print was excellent.

4124531,5,B003H8F3AY,"I agree with many of the positive reviews here.  This is an affecting film with fine performances by Bryce Howard and Chris Evans.  In fact, Howard and Evans' aesthetic and manner are reminiscent of Liz Taylor and Paul Newman in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" (though I also see shades of Vivien Leigh too).  The cinematography is wonderful too.  The closing shot at the end is similar to a scene from ""Gone With the Wind.""

Some reviews state Evans is not given much to work with but I think his character, Jimmy Dobyne V, is as equally layered as Fisher Willow. A lot is hinted at but not explored in depth which did not bother me.  He is a governor's grandson which suggests he not only was wealthy at one time but that also due to this he and Fisher more than likely became familiar with one another walking in similar circles.

Then after some kind of financial calamity takes place Jimmy and his father accept employment by Fisher's father perhaps as a favor to Jimmy's grandfather. Due to their financial situation his mother breaks down, and his father takes to drinking. He has affection for Fisher too and all of this is churning inside him so he explodes believing Fisher is accusing him of stealing her diamond earring when clearly she has NOT.

He believes he can not act on his affection because his social status has changed even though the Dobynes' good reputation has not.  He keeps his guard up with her accordingly, and the scene where he helps her up after she falls on the stairs is sweet because he lets his guard down.  In contrast he is matter-of-fact after having sex with Vinnie at the party although her status is the same as his.  Evans' low-key, almost brooding performance is great. The first scene where he visits his mother his emotion is immediate, heartfelt, and when he walks into the rain to cry is so poignant.  Great film.",1452384000,4,1853,4.531531531531532

4124593,4,B003H8F3AY,"Let me preface this review by saying that, initially, the only reason I was inclined to watch this movie was because Chris Evans is in it (I hope I don't lose any credibility for saying that!). However, once I began watching it, I couldn't help but feel that the writing felt familiar to me...turns out, it was. The screenplay for this movie was written by Tennessee Williams. I've seen other popular Tennessee Williams' movies, such as ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" or ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."" But what ""The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond"" really reminded me of was another work by Tennessee Williams' called ""This Property is Condemned"" which I loved.

I'm a 30-something woman, and I wasn't alive when ""This Property is Condemned"" was released so I can't attest to the popularity of this particular movie. But just like ""The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond,"" it is dialogue-heavy, has a strong female lead who is conflicted and trying to escape something, has troubled relationships with various people around her, and is a period-piece.

If you are a fan of ""This Property is Condemned,"" I think you will really enjoy ""The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond."" And, of course, vice versa.",1434758400,2,1171,4.763546798029557

Don't get me wrong, he does an amazing job with this role. Too good, actually (I've heard reviewers say this about him in other roles), because he gives this character a depth and a subtlty that I don't think is in the script, which seems to indicate a more simplistic character. (The quickie in the car, with a woman his character is supposed to see as beneath him, seemed particularly wrong for the depth and tenderness toward others Evans invested in the role.) I'd love to see him in a role that allowed him to explore a character with more complexity, but with the same integrity.  Bryce Dallas Howard blew me away. I'd just seen ""The Help"" and she did a good job of making me hate her. In the course of this movie she managed to make me go from rooting against her and being on Jimmy's side, to rooting for her and hoping Jimmy will fall in love with her--or at least not hurt her. The director deserves credit for making Tennessee Williams both accessible and enjoyable, although many in today's audience probably still won't find him appealing.

The script would have worked much better as a theater play, and it is obvious throughout the movie. Pacing and the storytelling suffers from transitions better suited to switches between acts on stage, and thus the flow of the story comes across as inconsistent and disjointed. In contrast, characters are well developed, however relationships between them don't get enough time to get established. I recommend this movie for a night in, if for nothing else then for understated but powerful performances, led by Chris Evans who gets to show off his capability to inhabit character fully, and to use subtle acting to its full power. It almost feel like the movie didn't dare to break out of the boundaries and limitations of the script and to unleash the full power of the underlying story and characters, and instead is teetering at the edge of greatness never crossing into it.",1409702400,3,998,5.018072289156627

I bought this Blu-ray some time ago because I love Tennessee Williams and there were good reviews. No, this movie is new. It's every bit as effective as the old classics. More so I think. I put the disc in the player when I thought I had ten minutes to begin a brain file for prioritizing my next 50 or 60 movies. I only view movies when I am in the mood. As it happens events were jump'n all around me and I was also extremely interested in every detail of the Sochi Olympics. All that is to say that in six minutes my jaw had dropped and I was a palpitating. I'm a Minnesotan. I have been interested in the south since I was in the USAF in Greenville Mississippi. The Air Force provided a local man to teach office procedures to innocent young soldiers. This man was a local and he thought we should connect with our temporary environment. He talked Tennessee Williams and southern living because the South was outside the door, and he hoped we would get it. I guess I got it. It ""took"" on me as I was developing into a life long ""activist."" The point is that there is so much more to the South than meets the eye. I traveled the Mississippi on the Delta Queen twice on a mission unrelated to my topic here. Suffice it to say, the American South is a different country. Some of it is wonderful and some is not. I have never seen a Williams film or play that I did not want to see experience again. This movie is so much more than I expected. The beauty of the South, the incredible actors, and cinematography. I was on board for the full trip. So much story and emotion and insight. Next time I'll view it on a hot day, and I'll have a mint julep with it.

4124711,3,B003H8F3AY,"This is a well made film, the story is interesting and the characters are almost three dimensional. In some ways, I think this might be better suited to the stage, even though it was written as a screen play.

Fisher is a southern belle, the heiress of two fortunes who happens to be cursed with having a father who is known as a murderer locally. Jimmy is the grandson of a former governor, but that is not something that easy to tell as his father his a drunk and his mother is in an asylum. Fisher decides to hire Jimmy to be her escort to various social events to avoid having to deal with her social pariah-ness.

The problem is that Fisher actually cares more for Jimmy that she was willing to admit. While Jimmy is too cautious of Fisher to feel that way for her.

The performances in this are great. Ellen Burstyn is fantastic as a woman who could be Fisher's future self. She gives Fisher some fabulously sassy advice. Ann Margaret plays Fisher's aunt (owner of the Teardrop Diamond earrings), its rather fun to see her being so prim and proper. Bryce Dallace Howard nails it as Fisher who is a very complex character. In the hands of a lesser actor Fisher could have come off as very unsympathetic and bratty. Instead we are privy to a very layered character (via Howard's layered performance). She is both vulnerable and strong, confused and determined, overwhelmed and overwhelming. Its really amazing to see. Chris Evans as Jimmy does a good job of being a sort of moral center for Fisher and himself, he is self righteous and confused but also sees Fisher with both eyes. She may not be someone that he thinks he can love be certainly he shows he is someone who cares for her. He does a good job of portraying how Jimmy wants her to be a better person, for herself.",1384992000,5,1779,4.450920245398773

4124732,5,B003H8F3AY,"I watched The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond without making the connection that I'd seen a Tennessee Williams film before; it is a masterpiece in a day of too few such films.

The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond really pulled me into the story. I became part of the characters' lives and struggles, and was left profoundly moved. The pace of this remarkable film captures the laid-back South in the early 1900s, but it never drags.  This is, however, a movie that the viewer has to pay attention to; it demands that the viewer be engaged, it provokes thought. So much is said in few words as well as with no words. All words, even words spoken in the background, are significant, as are looks, touches, gestures, body language. Nothing is superfluous. Each scene is well-played and necessary. The one soliloquy, with its changed lighting, is superbly done.

Lighting is used to exceptional effect throughout the film. All the scenes are well-planned and well-executed; even the side characters are portrayed effectively. The entire cast was chosen with keen perception; together they achieve a truly memorable film.

The acting, direction, music, cinematography...all are so well done. The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond is artistic, moving, and often heart-wrenching. There is also some humor and lightheartedness. I cannot praise the superb acting highly enough, particularly that of Bryce Dallas Howard (as Fisher Willow) and Chris Evans (as Jimmy Dobyne, full name James Dobyne the Fifth) in the lead roles, likewise the flawless instinct and direction of Jodie Markell.

In the case of the main characters, Fisher Willow and Jimmy Dobyne, both have two essentials in common: 1) the importance of strict honesty, and 2) the keeping of promises. Each has a deep sense of honor and strength of character despite their human weaknesses and imperfections.

Similarly, they both seek, almost desperately, to really connect meaningfully with someone. Another commonality is that Jimmy and Fisher are each out of their element in some way and the problems this creates for each is very human.

There are intense moments in this film that could be disturbing and even harmful to some viewers, like the scenes between Fisher and the bedridden, incapacitated and elderly Aunt Addie (her friend Julie's aunt). If one keeps Fisher's and Addie's interaction in perspective, seeing the significance of Fisher's dedication to keeping her promise, as well as the compassion and courage that are part of her character, then there probably won't be a problem. Anyone with a long-standing chronic illness (or who has thoughts of suicide as a way out of suffering) might be badly affected by this part, so proceed with caution or skip this film. Also, Aunt Addie has some powerful words of insight for Fisher who proclaims and clings to her honesty, including significant words about ""all the teardrop diamonds in this world, lost or found...""

It is fascinating to watch the dynamics between Fisher and Jimmy, where Jimmy begins by being told by Fisher what to do (since she asked him to be her escort, bought him his suits, and they drive in her car) to a turning of the tables where Jimmy asserts himself with confidence.

The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond is exceptional. It is a cut above, full of layers, contrasts and nuance, a truly transcendent film. It is one worth watching repeatedly, there is so much to notice and see with new eyes. I recommend it highly for emotionally and intellectually mature audiences. It is not a film for families, nor is it a film for those seeking more shallow entertainment, but it is definitely for those who want a movie with depth, who can see beneath the surface and recognize what's there.",1355011200,11,3703,4.950080515297906

4124736,4,B003H8F3AY,"I first saw this movie very recently on Showtime.  I ordered the DVD because it promised additional scenes and extras, including an interview with the director.  I tried to buy the screenplay or anthology that had the screenplay in it, because I wanted a deeper understanding of the story.  How did Fisher know Jimmy if he only worked at the commissary for two weeks?  What is the background of Jimmy's family (other than he was the grandson of an ex-governor)?  What was the relationship between Fisher and Jimmy before she made the proposition?  Did Jimmy love Fisher? What was the prior relationship between Jimmy and Viv McCorkle?  And many more.  The DVD extras did not answer any of my questions, except the director did say at one point something to the effect:  ""when Jimmy loved Fisher and when he didn't."" The rest of the director's interview revealed nothing about the heart of the story, but babblings about how they tried to stay true to the great god of all things literary (or so you would think).  Bryce Dallas Howard is good in this, except when her accent changes throughout. Her overwrought piano playing almost caused me to turn off this film. I think the real star of this is Chris Evans.  He did an impeccable job (with what little was given him to work with) and his accent was spot on and believable.  The scene where he gets back in the car after Fisher races back to the house to get her coat and kill off Aunt Addie was remarkable.  The range of emotions on his face shows his skill at conveying exasperation, frustration, the release of anger and resignation is fascinating.  All along Jimmy was furious with Fisher, but it turns out that it was Miss McCorkle who stole the diamond, kept it from Jimmy, allowed him to be humiliated in front of everyone, drove a wedge between Jimmy and Fisher, and then used sex as a weapon to get what she wanted.  She's the one who made a fool of him.  Too bad she was rewarded with the sex she wanted.  I'd like to believe that in the end Jimmy loved Fisher and that they were a good match.  He started out understanding his need to please Fisher (whatever you want) but finally ended up on nearly the same footing, which was necessary to any success in the relationship.

Bryce Dallas Howard is electrifying as Fisher Willow, a heroine as complex and engaging as any that Tennessee Williams ever created, and Chris Evans gives her excellent support.  I was involved with their struggle from beginning to end, and actually found myself sighing with relief when they finally found each other!  Jodie Markell's direction is flawless, splendidly evoking the sleepy yet dangerous languor of Williams's south.  One of Markell's strengths as director is her evident recognition that Williams was not only a dramatist but also a poet.

4124745,4,B003H8F3AY,"I find it strange (or maybe just typical for an antsy media world) that this film was shunned so widely, if not overlooked.  Also, there seems to be a recurrent animosity against Bryce Dallas Howard as an actress that I find hard to justify.  I can think of few others who are showing such promise at an early age.

And as for the screenplay that is the inevitable draw of the film, it certainly falls canonically among Tennessee Williams' lesser works; yet even his lesser works have always carried much magic, and an idiomatic command of poetic elegance that no American writer since has matched.

We all know well Blanche's ruminations about paper lanterns as a metaphor for magic in the world; people far smarter and wiser than me have called those words among the most deeply felt ever written in the English language.  In this film, Fisher Willow has her moment too, hers more nuanced than the melodramatic flourish of Vivian Leigh's delivery.  She pines for the company not of strangers, but of people who have meaning, who aspire to art and creation, and so forth.  They are words meant to be heard spoken, rather than spit out in this no-name review on the Internet.

So all of that is to say, the best you can do is ignore the shrugging critics and watch this film.  It does the legacy of Tennessee Williams justice, it is beautifully shot on a very low budget, and it is a fine performance by a budding actress who absorbs the playwright's intentions elegantly.",1284249600,32,1472,4.630769230769231

4124747,5,B003H8F3AY,"""The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond,"" is a real gem but it is not for everyone.  If you are not a big Tennessee Williams fan, you probably will not like it.  If you are unfamiliar with Tennessee Williams, then you are better off watching ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" or ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.""

Admittedly, this is not one of Williams' best stories.  The reason the film works so well is the acting and directing.

I had seen Bryce Dallas Howard in a few other films but they did not prepare me for this absolutely thrilling performance.  This is not just the best performance of the year but it is the best performance in the past several years.  She brings the character of Fisher Willow to life the way that Vivian Leigh did for Blanche DuBois.  In many ways Fisher Willow is like a young version of Blanche.

Fisher is a typical Williams' heroine.  She initially comes off as a selfish, self centered, Southern Belle but underneath she is much more fragile than anyone suspects.  Bryce Dallas Howard is able to bring this out with such complexity and nuance that we can sympathize with a character that we should not care about so much.  Even in her best moments she seems as though she could shatter at any moment.

This performance alone is enough reason to see this film.

The story follows the familiar themes covered in other Tennessee Williams stories:  loneliness, loss of wealth, fall from grace, and battling interior demons.  The teardrop diamond could represent the wealth and status her family once had.  It is not just a $5000 jewel.  It is a symbol of what her family once was and what was once the old South.

Jodie Markell does an impressive job directing.  Her style is old school.  She knows when to let the camera linger and when to let the scenes play out.  The film does not seem rushed and it never drags.  The cinematography is gorgeous with burnished orange dominating the color palette.

""The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond,"" may not be one of the four best movies made from a Tennessee Williams story but it is not far behind.  This is mandatory viewing for any fan of Tennessee Williams.",1284076800,16,2110,4.547872340425532
4124748,2,B003H8F3AY,"THE LOSS OF A TEARDROP DIAMOND is a film that tries hard to be significant and important and barely keeps the viewer seated until it is over. The 'screenplay' is credited to Tennessee Williams (who has been dead since 1983), having been written in 1957, a year after 'Baby Doll', and while the screenplay may have been completed by Williams, it has obviously been 'touched up' by someone else: Williams more than likely never planned to have the work on celluloid. The cast is adequate, given the material, and the direction (Jodie Markell) is pretty shoddy. It probably would have been best to leave this 'screenplay' by one of America's greatest playwrights on the shelf.

Fisher Willlow (Bryce Dallas Howard) is from wealth in Tennessee, but her family is disliked because of a levee built by the father that ruined the hopes of farmers in the area. She is a shallow, resented, needy, attention hungry woman, unmarried and past her Southern prime, having spent her 'debut years' abroad studying in Paris (and being hospitalized in Zurich for mental illness). She returns home, fancies the hunky Jimmy Dobyne (Chris Evans) who is the grandson of the ex-mayor of the town, but who spends his time caring for this alcoholic failure of a father (Will Patton) and his institutionalized mentally ill mother (Barbara Garrick). Not having viable social connections, Fisher invites Jimmy to be her social escort, buys him tuxedoes and clothes to make him look like a wealthy suitor, borrows the family teardrop diamond earrings from Cornelia (Ann-Margaret), and is off to a Halloween party hosted by Julie (Mamie Gummer). On the way into the party Fisher loses one of the teardrop diamonds, and flies into a panic. She is summoned upstairs by the mother of Julie - Addie (Ellen Burstyn) - who has had multiple strokes and longs to die. Knowing that Fisher is a headstrong woman, Addie convinces Fisher to 'assist' her death by handing her what amounts to be an overdose of pills. Meanwhile, downstairs, Jimmy has taken up with a guest of Julie's - Vinnie (Jessica Collins), who has a history of being a salesclerk in a drugstore thus making her not of the same echelon as the others at the party. Apparently Jimmy and Vinnie had been friends before and passion enters seemingly binding the two social misfits. But reality steps in when Fisher discovers the developments and the social rules win out. The ending is too sanguine to mention.

The elements that were the recipe for Tennessee William's highly successful plays and films are repeated here, but now we have no character with whom we can empathize: everyone is a plagiarized caricature of Williams' popular tropes.

Not much if any hope or goodness and left much to be desired as far as the plot goes.  Wish I could have that time back is the only thing it made me realize is that really are people in this world with no hope.,1526774400,,389,4.328767123287672

8396898,5,B003H8F3AY,"I am a big fan of  Tennessee William's classic southern dramas: Streetcar named Desire, The Night of the Iguana, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, also Baby Doll . etc, I recommend ""Loss of a Teardrop Diamond"" It's a newer film based on another of his scripts and fits very well into the classic mold (except for one sex scene). I am not very familiar with the lead actress, but her performance reminded me highly of Elizabeth Taylor and Viven Leigh in his other classic works. I am surprised at how well this modern film fits into the classic oeuvre of the earlier age. They did a great job with this film.  Yes, it does feel a little stage bound at times, because he wrote most of his works for the stage. But overall, it's a great film.",1508630400,,728,4.268115942028985
