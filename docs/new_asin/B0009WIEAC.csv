8068378,2,B0009WIEAC,Read the books some 70 year ago . Cute but low budget. Ransome was the best for 10 year olds.,1501372800,,93,3.7
8068379,5,B0009WIEAC,"All of the Swallows and Amazons series get five stars!  On the ninth of the twelve books, now, with my kids.  Ordering the hardcovers from the UK, now, because someday I want to read them to my grandchildren.  We watched this after finishing the book.  Wonderful period-accurate boats, clothes, area, etc.",1475798400,,305,4.921568627450981
8068380,5,B0009WIEAC,"I first read these books when I was in grade school; my dad was a fan, too. They hold up exceptionally well as it's more than 40 years after the first reading, and I still enjoyed the novel.",1453075200,,190,4.026315789473684
8068381,5,B0009WIEAC,"I have read and re-read all of Arthur Ransoms Books with the Swallows & Amazons,and enjoyed them very much. The Coot Club TV/Movie version portrayed the books so well.  Made in the 1980's but portrayed the 1930's was well done and some good acting by the younger cast. If you wish to turn back the clock to those lovely days without TV's and computer games and escape to 'simpler' times and to the back waters of rural England, and are still a kid at heart, then this is for you.",1361577600,3,479,4.322222222222222
8068382,4,B0009WIEAC,"A touching story with charming actors, The Big Six follows the wildlife-preservation efforts of a group of young people in England. Great message, compelling storyline, and engaging actors! A great film!",1360022400,2,203,5.580645161290323
8068383,5,B0009WIEAC,"My husband bought the VHS movie years ago and loved it.  WHen we got rid of our video player, I wanted him to have it on DVD.  He loved receiving it and watching it again after so long

Thank you for prompt delivery.",1359590400,,216,3.9767441860465116
8068384,5,B0009WIEAC,"This sequel to ""Coot Club"" is equally nice.  Unfortunately availability of the ""Big Six"" has been a problem (why I think there are so few reviews), which I hope will be relieved.
Both videos are faithful to the books, and if you like the books you'll like the video.  Both are sort of ""masterpiece theaterish"" in terms of novelty (for today's kids) both due to period dress and being a bit slow by modern slam-bang kid-vid standards.  Whether this a plus or minus depends on taste... for me it's a plus.",1063584000,,503,4.5054945054945055
