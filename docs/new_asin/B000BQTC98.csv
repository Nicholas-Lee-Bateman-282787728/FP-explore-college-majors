2437850,5,B000BQTC98,"The works of venerable horror writer H.P. Lovecraft have, in some ways, become the backbone of the genre, especially cinematic horror.  An astonishing number of relatively contemporary horror flicks and genre TV shows--everything from 1965's DIE, MONSTER, DIE through Rod Serling's series THE NIGHT GALLERY (1970s) to Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD (1981) and beyond--have either borrowed elements from Lovecraft's literary mythos or attempted to adapt one of his stories.

In spite of Lovecraft's unquestionable influence on the genre, few filmmakers have been able to accurately or faithfully translate the writer's works to either the small or large screen.  At best, most attempts to adapt Lovecraft either vaguely evoke the nihilistic subtext of the author's work (e.g., Stuart Gordon's 1985 classic RE-ANIMATOR) or pay simple homage by making a reference or two (as Raimi does by building his EVIL DEAD stories around Lovecraft's ubiquitous fictional book of the occult, the Necronomicon).  Until now, that is.  Under the guidance of director Andrew Leman and screenwriter Sean Branney, the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society has filmed and released a little film entitled THE CALL OF  CTHULHU (2005), based on the author's story of the same name.  And it is being praised by critics and fans alike as being one of the most faithful Lovecraft cinematic adaptations ever.

The film follows the three-part narrative construction of Lovecraft's original story, using flashbacks and similar devices to shift back and forth to various time frames.  The story centers on a young man who has inherited his late great-uncle's research documents pertaining to the Cthulhu Cult. Intrigued by his uncle's obsession with the cult, the nephew studies the documents closely and pieces together the dread implications of the research, and soon after he himself resumes his uncle's investigation of the Cthulhu Cult. When he finally understands the dreadful and disturbing reality of what his uncle has uncovered, his own sanity begins to crumble. Unable to cope and ultimately institutionalized, he passes the information on to his psychiatrist, who in turn hears Cthulhu's call....

In a daring but clever and creative move, filmmakers Leman and Branney decided to cinematically adapt Lovecraft's influential 1925 horror story THE CALL OF CTHULHU in the form of a faux early silent film, complete with black-and-white photography, title cards for dialogue, and a classical music score.  There are even artificial scratches and wear marks, making it appear as if the film were indeed made in mid-1920s--the period in which Lovecraft wrote many of his famous works--and only recently pulled from the studio vaults and dusted off for posterity.  By making the film look like a product of 1925 instead of one from 2005, the filmmakers have been able to utilize old-school FX like stop-motion animation, in-the-camera trick-photography, and miniatures, avoiding the temptation to heavily rely on CGI and other high-tech contrivances that could bog the film down and cause distraction or deviation from the actual story. The result is a ""vintage"" film that draws the audience into another place AND another time as it faithfully unfurls Lovecraft's tale of ancient mystery and hair-raising horror.

The cast does an excellent job in realizing director Leman's Lovecraftian vision and writer Branney's script. Acting in a silent film requires skills foreign to most contemporary actors, and it is consequently a dying art.  Yet the performances in THE CALL OF CTHULHU are very effective.  Especially good are Matt Foyer, who portrays the nephew, and Noah Wagner, who plays the captain of an ill-fated island expedition.  It is obvious that, before stepping before the camera, both actors carefully studied classic silent cinema to learn the pantomime and exaggerated facial expressions required to relay emotion without the benefit of sound.  Not only do they and their fellow actors do an on-target job of recreating the ""feel"" of a genuine film from the Silver Screen's silent era, they also do a great job of acting and thereby create a credible populace for the world of Lovecraft's mythos.

In addition, the special FX by Dan Novy and crew are very well executed and totally believable within the context of the film.  Dream sequences are reminiscent of the German Expressionist silent classic THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (1920), and the stop-motion sequences are a clear nod to the master of the form, Ray Harryhausen. True, some of the sets and FX are obviously of the low-budget ilk, but this really only adds to the overall old-school charm of the flick.

The DVD edition of THE CALL OF CTHULHU from Lurker Films is well worth the price of admission.  Not only does it offer a pristine digital transfer of the faux silent-era flick, it also offers a very interesting making-of documentary (with sound) that features some behind-the-scene footage and interviews with cast and crew.  Even the menu screens on this disc are cool, evoking the style of the art-deco movie houses of the 1920s and 1930s.  This DVD is a must-have for fans of Lovecraft, and it will make a fine addition to the film collection of any true fan of horror cinema.",1131926400,207,5223,5.191666666666666
2437851,4,B000BQTC98,"That was a great movie short. The wife and I are keen Lovecraft & Clark Ashton Smith fans, so we were very excited at a Cthulhu movie based on one of HPL's most famous stories! It did not disappoint and made for a good late night experience.

I think the decision to film it as a 1920's style silent film was a good one. If they had made one back then, then it would probably been shot-for-shot like this production. We even enjoyed the stop-motion Cthulhu part as well. It evoked memories of the first King Kong movie. It was a very polished production and not an amateur fan movie which we feared it might be.

I think only one thing betrayed the video source of the movie and that was the glare from the torches during the Legrasse scene. But I understand the ease (and cost saving) of shooting to video as opposed to film. That was my only criticism.

Otherwise, you can see a lot of love and dedication went into this and I hope they do more!",1131926400,4,947,4.25
2437852,5,B000BQTC98,"It's black and white, and silent. Not a combination that would excite a modern movie fan.  But this is the very best movie of a Lovecraft story yet made.  One other reviewer said that the stop action Cthulhu was cheesy.  Well, yeah, but cheesy in a wonderful way.  If you are a Lovecraft fan, you need to see this movie.  Very well done, a lot of fun to watch and very true to the original story.  Well worth 5 stars, or more.",1131753600,6,426,4.134146341463414
2437853,3,B000BQTC98,"Its obvious from the very first frame that the filmmakers revere Lovecraft, and they went to great lengths to deliver a product that is true to his spirit.  I really want to root for them, that's why I'm reluctant to say anything negative about this product.

The good news: this is the most faithful adaption of a Lovecraft story that I've ever seen.  Its even more impressive given the limited budget that the filmakers had to work with.

The bad news: Cthulhu himself.  The stop motion model at the end, which I waited through the entire movie for, was a major disappointment.  It looked amatuerish, phony, and not at all convincing.  Sorry, but that's the truth. I know they wanted to use technology that would have been available in the silent era, and I can respect that, but all that ultimately matters, in my opinion, is the image that ends up on screen.  They should have hired an experienced CGI artist.",1131062400,7,913,4.627329192546584
2437854,5,B000BQTC98,"In the past, adaptations of horror writer H.P. Lovecraft's short stories have been downright awful (The Dunwich Horror) or faithful in spirit only (Dagon). Some of the best efforts (In the Mouth of Madness) have been more homages to his fiction than actual adaptations. The clever folks at the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society have filmed their own adaptation of one of Lovecraft's most famous stories, ""The Call of Cthulhu"" and done it as a silent movie that looks and feels like it was made in the 1920s - the time period in which Lovecraft lived and set most of his stories in.

The Call of Cthulhu faithfully recreates the look of 1920s silent films complete with a slightly scratchy, artifact-laden print. The rich, black and white cinematography (filmed in Mythoscope no less) of David Robertson is fantastic. It has a texture to it that looks just as good as Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow's retro-sepia tone look but for a fraction of the budget and with no CGI anywhere to be found. The cinematography also gives the movie the atmosphere and mood of a classic horror film and creates believable and very authentic feelings of dread.

The special visual effects by Dan Novy - especially the dream sequences - are well done and totally believable within the context of the movie. A trip to a foreboding, unearthly land is something right out of Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari  with a dash of Ray Harryhausen for good measure. There are a few moments where the effects take on a slightly fake quality but it only adds to the charm of the movie. In this day and age it is so refreshing to see a film that does not rely on CGI but opts for real, tangible effects that are still as effective as ever.

The film's trailer, presented in ""Mythoscope"" sound, effectively conveys the look of the movie without giving away too much.

""Hearing `The Call'"" is a 28-minute making of featurette. One gets the impression that this was a labour of love done by a group of friends who got together and made this wonderful film. The cast and crew talk about their experiences with good humour for this highly enjoyable extra.

""Photographs From the Set"" is a three minute montage of behind the scenes pictures.

There are ""Production Stills"" from the final film.

Finally, there are eight minutes of deleted footage, including several takes of the stop motion Cthulhu doing its thing and some amusing improvisations by the actors because they didn't have to memorize dialogue.",1130371200,106,2485,4.749419953596288
2437855,5,B000BQTC98,"Lets see, if I could sum up this entire review into one catchy phrase to quote on the back of the DVD case, ""Wow!"" would have to be it. When I first found out about this film and watched the trailer some seven or eight months ago, I was instantly excited and thrilled by the prospect. Normally I find myself skeptical and playing the role of the cynic when it comes to movies, but not this time. Not only does it do great justice to the Lovecraft classic, but its an extremely pleasing film regardless.

The directing is perhaps the most obvious part of this films genius, as it is presented as it would have been in the 1920s. The use of shadows is especially nice, oftentimes creating quite a bit of ambience through backlighting and solid silhouettes in the foreground. There are even added imperfections to the film, such as dust specks and the occasional hair. Following in suite right after these facts is the music and acting, obviously both are quite important in a silent film. Music is half the battle in creating atmosphere and, as an understatement, it succeeds. Depending on how well you favor orchestrated scores, it might even be worth purchasing the accompanying soundtrack. The acting on the other hand might not come off as something that would make or break the film, but that ideology would be wrong. In a silent medium where phonic acting is an impossibility, the overdramatic hand gestures and facial expressions are crucial. Thankfully, the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society has found a slew of talented individuals to fill the huge amount of roles that the film supports.

Before watching the Call of Cthulhu, I was worried that it would be far too short of a film. At just under an hour (forty-seven minutes), the film does manage to build the story up and resolve what conflict was introduced. I don't believe any of this would have been possible had the film been a talkie, but seeing as its silent, the style gives it the illusion of being longer. This is in no way a problem, but interesting to note nonetheless. Not only is this sense of 1920s style present in the film but in pretty much everything concerning the package. The printed address label on the package was mimicking something thrown together in a typewriter, the pleasing invoice found alongside the movie was printed out as a telegram and even the cover art captures the period feeling perfectly.

Overall, as much praise as I have given the film, I must also point out the few flaws that I had perceived. The music during the meeting between the police officer and the professors received a rather odd transition from the music of the prior scene. It seemed fitting enough for a party, but the shift was odd. Aside from that, some of the swamp scenes looked odd, but this was assumingly places where a green screen technique was used. In all fairness, it did look appropriate for the period, so maybe thats what was intended anyway. Similarly, the stop animation Cthulhu was well done and yet sadly not shown much. Its understandable in order to maintain the desired sense of fear, but disappointing when one considers just how much work must have went into the creation of that creature. What shots are shown tend to be extremely brief and would probably only confuse viewers who are not in the know, as it were. Lovecraft fans should have no problem, but the ending may be a little perplexing for the uninitiated.

The entire cast and crew deserve far more admiration than they will probably receive. As a relatively no-name film with an almost nonexistent budget its hard to standout amongst all of the CGI centered blockbusters that Hollywood throws out each year. If you're the kind of person who is willing to break away from the norm of popcorn thrillers, then the Call of Cthulhu will not disappoint. If you are, however, illiterate or dependent on Hollywoods overuse of sex and violence, then you may not be as pleased. In any case, I just hope that the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society receives enough exposure from this release to warrant a second film... perhaps the Shadow Over Innsmouth?",1130284800,8,4097,4.7258741258741255

I guess my only complaint was Cthulhu, himself...not quite as frightening as I would have liked.  I didn't quote like the way he was shaped.  The actors were fine.

Horror stories with zombies, blood and guts, sawn-off limbs, etc...are just cliche, tiresome and gross. THIS, folks, is horror done with class and mystique. (I'm talking about both this movie and about HPL's writings in general.) My only problem was the cost...$20 dollars for a DVD where the movie wasn't even 90 minutes long.

Cthulhu and his kind, weren't just aliens, they ruled the world as gods, their Cults were hiding in the shadows , waiting... In the 1920's the world was more fragile and vulnerable, we were no match for these creatures, and only the brave few had been barely able to save humanity from their clutches.
 The brilliant move, to make ""The Call Of Cthuhlu "" into a silent movie, keeps the eerie feel you get from reading the story, the atmosphere, and suspense come through.

2437885,5,B000BQTC98,"This movie was made with a little budget and unknown actors by people I never heard about - but after the first minute I completely forgot to care about it! I believe that Andrew Lenan (director-producer) and Sean Braney (scenarist-producer) were right on target when they decided to make this film silent and turn it in white and black - exactly as movies were made in 1926, when Lovecraft wrote ""The call of Cthulhu"". It gives an absolutely unique effect, which, I must admit, caused me to freeze before the screen for the whole 47 minutes...

""The Call of Cthulhu"" story, although quite short, is one of the most powerful, most disturbing and most influential things in the whole fantastic literature. Nobody ever tried to film it, because the challenge seemed too difficult - when one thinks about the CGIs necessary to make a credible Cthulhu and a credible city of R'lyeh, it is easy to understand why nobody even tried to make such an attempt.

But all this difficulty was avoided by making this film in the style which both Fritz Lang (""Metropolis"") and F.W. Murnau (""Nosferatu"") would recognize immediately. Expressions on the faces replacing the words convey a greater sense of fear and impending doom than any special effects. The LACK of details in some scenes is more disturbing than the overdose of pixels in the best Blu-Ray - and the obviously cheap decorations in the city of R'lyeh surprisingly created (at least in my perception) more awe and shock than the best shots of Mordor in ""Lord of the Rings"". Bottom line, the settings in this film allowed Lovecraftian magic to play in a very powerful and pure way.

The very brief and very vague apparition of Cthulhu was very well done, with the maximum use of his shadow and only a little glimpse of the Great Old God himself. On another hand, small figures of Cthulhu worshipped by his cultists are very well shown and they are REALLY scary!

Actors performed wonderfully! I really had the impression that I watched a genuine film from 20s and that Doctor Mabuse would enter through that door at any moment...

To conclude, I was absolutely conquered by this movie and I am really, really glad that I bought it! And I am absolutely keeping it to rewatch it from time to time!",1380499200,3,2242,4.694656488549619

The ""con"", in this case, is the fact that it's a silent movie: stop messing with your volume control, sit back, and relax. Another ""con"" is the use of obvious stage props, particularly for the dream sequences and for the sailors' discovered island temple (the sleeping city of R'lyeh, where one of the Old Gods, Cthulu, has obviously been awakened from his millenially-long sleep and is equally obviously disturbed about it--where can a guy get an uninterrupted night's rest around here, huh?). However, the big pro is that this film sticks faithfully to the Lovecraft short story by the same name. The characters' facial expressions show appropriate shock, horror, and awe; Cthulu seems at least adequately scary; and the threat Cthulu poses by film's end is consistent with Lovecraft's attempts to convey truly cosmic horror. Getting back to Jung, might there be some things too dark to look at for very long? Perhaps so, my friends. Perhaps so.",1365033600,,1058,4.949438202247191

2437897,3,B000BQTC98,"I can't score it very high on production values, and it's appeal will be limited to Lovecraft fans, but I'd have to say this is the ONLY video or film I've seen of any H.P. Lovecraft work that makes a serious attempt at rendering the original story on screen.  Usually, shock/exploitation movies like Reanimator or From Beyond just steal a title, some character names, and a few monstrous ideas from the story, but otherwise ignore it.  Lovecraft's deliberately archaic writing style and turn of the century sensibility (cosmic horror really is rooted in a horror at confronting the cosmos newly discovered by Einstein and Hubble) are hard to translate to modern media, and most filmmakers don't even try.  The clever conceit here is to make it an ""old"" movie in the style of a silent film from the 1920s.  It allows the characters to act and speak (well, mouth words before they're displayed on dialog cards) much as they do in the original story, and incidentally saves a bundle on sound editing (there's just music) and special effects (a nifty exercise in what you can accomplish with more imagination than money).  The result is quite satisfactory, and I enjoyed it.  The 3 stars are for a more general audience.  If you've read and enjoyed Lovecraft you should definitely check it out - I'd rate it a 4 for fans of the Mythos if only for a chance to see what this stuff looks like in a good faith movie adaptation (and heck, a 5 if you're a fan AND on Amazon Prime and don't have to pay for it!).",1363132800,,1502,4.561338289962825

2437902,5,B000BQTC98,"I have watched this move twice, and I will watch it again.  Made in the style of a 1920's black and white silent horror flick the director, cast, crew, and special effects personnel pulled off a flawless tail of terror.  By using the film quality and special effects of the 1920s silents to absolute perfection, the film's spooky character is enhanced far beyond what it would otherwise be.  The film run time is also perfection.  There isn't one unnecessary moment.  If you have watched recent blockbuster movies, such as the Twilight series, you know how the current trend is to include more - much more - than necessary.  The masters, Monet for example, knew just how much was needed.  To add too much was to destroy the message.  Try it yourself.  Print out a Monet and then remove one element, no matter how small, and you will instantly see that the element cannot be removed.  The very same thing goes for adding something to the master's work.  I used to paint copies of Monet's works to try and improve my painting ability, and I would try taking out or adding small elements.  I instantly saw that changing anything destroyed the picture.  The true master's hand is unerring. That describes this movie.  Every element is needed, but anything additional would hurt the film.

The story is actually related in reverse, starting with a doctor interviewing a patient in a dreary room with harsh lighting and distinct shadows.  The patient is assembling a puzzle of Va Gogh's Starry Night, which is near surrealistic and sets the background for the twisted yarn.  The lighting is magnificent throughout, often reverting to the total white washout in parts of the scene so familiar to viewers of silent films; however, the washout is never without an exacting purpose.  As the patient tells his tail the doctor flips through a stack of files, and these files provide a continuing connection between parts of the story as it progresses backward through time, through the investigations of the patient's ancestors.  A short glance at the file label precedes the viewer going into the story contained in the file and marching back to the evil they chance upon as events reach their conclusion.

In one section of the plot the frayed crew of the damaged vessel Emma boards the Alert they find drifting in the south seas' night.  We watch through dirty windows, spying on the crew as they examine the wheel house of the abandoned ship while a single light, swinging wildly from a long cord, illuminates their search.  Scattered clues tell the shoddy searchers little until they stumble across the ship's log entries directing them to an apparently uncharted island,  the ship's last stop.  The bedraggled crew manages to reach the dark shore as lightening flashes along the cloud's rims.  They climb the surrealistic landscape of misshapen rocks to discover... well, that you will have to watch the movie to unearth.

A first class horror film that lovers of movies will watch over and over to discover new clues to the making of this masterpiece.

This movie is pretty faithful to his story: ""call of chlulhu"" as far as the story goes. However for some reason they decided to make this movie as if it were the silent movie days of pre 1927!. They match the effects of that  era and if this were made in that time frame it would have done well at the cinema. It looks like a movie from that period exactly and it's silent. However I really DIDN""T need them to add scratches and lines and specks to the films print to make it look like it was 85 years old! After all back then a movie didn't start out that way! (scratched up). I didn't like that in those modern grind  house movies either. When I buy a grind house movie I want them to repair the damage if possible. This however doesn't jump or skip, it just has lines and specks. The effects are just from that time period and it could have been made back then. It's a very atomspheric tale in spite of the lets recreate the 20's type of filmaking. ( I love those REAL old silent  movies though and wish more of them were on blu ray etc) so that's not the problem here. The musical score here though is awesome and really well done.  Why not just make it using todays effects? I don't know , it's a good silent movie that tries to be from that era. Why not make a silent movie with todays effects? I guess they wanted to recreate film the way it was when Lovecraft wrote this story. I did enjoy this effort though it's unusual and a real homage to the old silent movie days. If it were a real movie from that era I would five star it , just like I would Phantom of the opera"" ( 1927) or any such film.

2437908,5,B000BQTC98,"H.P. Lovecraft was an obscure writer who wrote ""weird"" fiction in and around the early 1930s. His work centered on indescribably horrible things that could drive men (HPL didn't have women protagonists) mad at the mere sight of them. His work was only marginally popular with publishers and he would have faded from view if not for August Derleth and his Arkham House publishing house, and beginning in 1981, Sandy Petersen's Role Playing game named for what is arguably Lovecraft's most accomplished novella; The Call of Cthulhu.

The story covers several generations of investigation into a cult and psychic phenomena that result eventually in the description of a horrific menace lying dead (but undead) under the Pacific Ocean waiting for the time when The Stars Are Right, when it will emerge to take possession of Earth. The very touch of Cthulhu's psychic dreams drives men insane. Its image in stone is unsettling and unwholesome. Its cultist worshipers are debased scum of the very worst sort.

The popularity of that RPG has enshrined Cthulhu and Lovecraft in three generations of people who otherwise would likely never have heard of him; the story is today famous, and more than one person has struggled with how to bring the ultimate horror of Cthulhu to the big screen without it all falling flat.

Which is where the HP Lovecraft Historical Society comes in, with a really very clever idea.

The idea is ""Mythoscope"", which put simply is that a film of a Lovecraft story should look and feel as though it were made in the period during which the tale was written.

Thus a high-contrast black and white movie using quite basic special effects, many of which would in another context be laughable but because of the late twenties ambiance of the production (which is superbly convincing) the viewer buys into without a qualm. And thus a stop-motion animation Cthulhu that is at once cheesy but also scary and so appropriate to the setting it works and works well.

The actors do a fine job of conveying the various dramatis personae. The sets conjure swamps and universities and doctors offices and Pacific Islands of dubious unearthly geometry not as they are but as a late 1920s audience would have expected them to look.

And it all works. I don't know who had the idea of Mythoscope but they had an honest-to-gosh brainwave when they did and deserve as much recognition as any Hollywood innovator.

The movie is a lot of fun and well worth your time. Buy it. Watch it. Invite your pals around and watch it again.

2437909,4,B000BQTC98,"Lovecraft's work has been a pleasure of mine since childhood but--like many others posting here--I've always been disappointed by efforts to bring his work to the screen. The principal reason, I think, is that much of the power of Lovecraft's fiction lies in what is implied, not what is shown or described, and even when the text is specifically descriptive in Lovecraft's work, the superiority of print over image comes into play, since we can imagine a horror derived from narrative far more awful (in the old, 'fearsome and awe-inspiring' sense of 'awful') than what even the best modern Hollywood special effects team can produce. In his fiction, Lovecraft often refers to the shortcomings of the finite, human mind to fully grasp the sheer cosmic magnitude of the forces in play. Lovecraft's work deals with vast enormities of time, for example: billions upon billions of 'strange aeons'. He writes about alien beings who are, well, completely alien to the human experience. Lovecraft's writing style, seemingly cumbersome at first, is solely devised to evoke moods and sensations, almost like a separate language of his own creation. The closest comparison I can make to the intent of Lovecraft's writing style is that of literary icon Henry James, strangely enough. Both Lovecraft and James are masters of the implicit and indirect, although I very much doubt James would appreciate the comparison.

Anyway, Lovecraft's work doesn't translate well to film for lots of reasons. This film, however, came close. The only time the project failed, in my view, was when the budgetary constraints became evident, especially when attempting to depict C'thulu which were clunky and amateurish even by low-budget standards. That said, the cult worshiper sequence in the swamp was first-rate film-making, and the use of a silent-movie approach as a story vehicle was downright inspired. Budget-related faults aside, I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Lovecraft. You won't be disappointed. For once.",1349481600,8,2012,5.26791277258567
2437910,4,B000BQTC98,"Speaking as an elapsed cultist but also as someone not that well-versed with things Lovecraftian, I found THE CALL OF CTHULHU to be perfectly enjoyable, although there is a caveat. Upon its release, THE CALL OF CTHULHU was touted as the best adaptation yet of an H.P. Lovecraft tale. And, yeah, its predecessor by decades, THE DUNWICH HORROR, does suck a--. Since ""the Father of Gothic Horror"" penned this in 1926, the filmmakers arrived at the conceit of shooting their adaptation as a silent, black and white picture, which is how the world would have viewed the film had it come out minutes after the story was published. Accordingly, the ""Mythoscope"" process was applied, a neat gimmick that combined vintage and modern filmmaking techniques to best convey that feel of the classic 1920s movie. So we're treated to old school intertitle cards and an original symphonic score and way too much eye shadow on the actors. Cue the trick photography and forced perspectives and the smoke and mirrors and the actors' exaggerated gestures. We'll gloss over the bit where the production crew, working with chump change, also gets to save money. Yay, Mythoscope!

It's a short film, running at near 47 minutes. It succeeds in bringing to the screen a work of literature that was touted as one of the most unadaptable stories. If you've read the source material, then you're aware of how the narrative - presented as an unearthed manuscript - doesn't quite adhere to a linear structure. The film circumvents that by use of copious flashback segments, and incorporating those segments into the framing narrative. The film mostly keeps faith with Lovecraft's renowned horror story. It had better, since the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society did the film distributing.

If Lovecraft has got it right, I'll be crapping my pants now. He posits that man is this insignificant mote and certainly not master of his domain. Beyond our ken, malevolent cosmic forces are at work. Listen to this ominous bit: ""Great Cthulhu waits dreaming in the sunken city of R'lyeh. The stars will again be right, and He shall return."" Lovecraft is like the anti-Hallmark greeting card.

The plot: Named the executor of his recently dead great-uncle's estate, a man chances upon the old man's locked box and, upon opening it, rifles thru its disquieting contents, a collection of manuscripts which reveals the existence of a murderous global cult that worships an ancient sleeping god named Cthulhu. And even as the man peruses the manuscripts, terrible things are befalling the world: earthquakes and riots and plagues of madness. Some say that these events are harbingers of a coming doomsday, that the sleeping god grows restless in his slumber. It stirs...

3.5 out of 5 stars for THE CALL OF CTHULHU. So the caveat is this: The film is best enjoyed when you regard it as an arthouse curio, done out of shallow pockets and guerrilla craftsmanship but with abiding love of Lovecraft lore. Because if you peek too close, you can't miss the cheesy production values. Although, okay, one guy's ""cheesy"" may be another guy's ""inspired."" For instance, in ""The Madness from the Sea"" sequence, the cast and crew couldn't afford to actually sail out to sea, so instead black fabric material was substituted for the deep waters. And, of course, shooting a film in black and white is more forgiving, tends to add richness and texture where there aren't any. And while the movie does manage to instill jittery atmosphere and a sense of growing dread, all that gets torpedoed when the fearsome, behemoth squid god finally surfaces... but in awkward stop-motion. I have no doubt that some will think this quaint or cute, but, for me, it's close to an anticlimactic payoff. I had to tell myself, ""It's a shoestring budget, this is the level of f/x that would've been around in the late '20s."" I couldn't quite fool myself. Still, this is an arthouse curio, right? And if you've still got a yen for movies about Lovecraftian horror, may I suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whisperer-in-Darkness/dp/B006LMRMMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whisperer in Darkness</a>&nbsp;or maybe&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cabin-In-The-Woods/dp/B008WB33LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cabin In The Woods</a>?

2437925,5,B000BQTC98,"There are 100 or more reviews already so I don't know how much I can add but here are my impressions.

I was turned on to this by listening to the HP Lovecraft Literary Podcast. I was reluctant to purchase a silent film because with few exceptions (Thief of Baghdad, for example) I haven't been much impressed. This film was one of the exceptions. It's a faithful adaptation of Lovecraft's story. Since there is no dialog in the story the ""silent treatment"" works far better than might be supposed. The only reservation I have is that the structure of the story might have been simplified. Lovecraft's story is deeply layered with flashbacks within flashbacks. I think the story might have worked better for film if the top layer had been omitted for clarity.

As much as I enjoyed it I didn't feel I got my money's worth until I perused the special features. The Behind-The-Scenes feature is almost as long as the feature itself and is utterly fascinating. I usually don't care much about these ""Making of..."" features but this one was particularly interesting because of the low budget of the project. When one sees how the project came together one is quite impressed with how convincing the final product is.

I highly recommend this; decide for yourself if this is your cup of tea.",1318204800,2,1286,4.706666666666667
2437926,3,B000BQTC98,"It was OK. I rate this as a pretty good student film project. Try to find it used, I'm sure there are plenty in this catagory.",1316304000,,126,3.8846153846153846
2437927,5,B000BQTC98,"It has been said that most of Lovecraft's works are considered largely 'unfilmable'. We have watched Hollywood try and try again... From Beyond, The Reanimator, Dagon, and the probable 'best', At the Mouth of Madness. These are films that deal specifically with the themes of cosmic horror, which by its own nature is 'unfilmable'. The major conceit is that the evil is always beyond human perception and understanding.

The Call of Cthulhu silent film is made by the fans for the fans and with barely a budget. It was a labour of love. It is, to date, the most faithful representation of Lovecraft's work and would probably made the old man proud... if he could get past his hatred of film. If you have read the short story, then you know what happens in the film. If you haven't read it, watching the film will have much the same effect - they are THAT close together.

There have been a few reviewers stating that the stop-motion film footage of the High Priest of R'lyeh is less than spectacular. In the film's defence, the creators left the model draped in darkness and mostly obscured... and in my opinion this serves the 'unknowable' qualities of something 'beyond our understanding' and it does so well.

As for special features, prepare for the ride of your life. There is an in-depth behind the scenes wherein the cast and crew laugh out loud and say time and time again that they could not believe that they were doing this. And perhaps the best is the laundry list of subtitles, insuring that fans across the globe can get the same level of enjoyment as anyone in the English speaking world.

As a fan of the mythos, I cannot express the positive nature of this adaptation well enough. For the newcomers, you cannot do better unless you start reading his stories today.

2437936,5,B000BQTC98,"I'm leaving the well-placed accolades for this film in the hands of those who have come before me; obviously from these other reviews, the class and brilliance of this indie film has not been lost on the fans.

For my two cents, I just want to say that I've never seen a more faithful, gripping, and inspired cinematic version of Lovecraft's work, and I've seen them all.  Making the film appear to be one created at the time the story itself was created was pure genius...I have to admit, I didn't think I would be that impressed, but these filmmakers obviously put a great deal of passion and respect for the source material into their work, and it shows in spades.  I would never have believed that a film contrived to look old would capture me and build the suspense that it does...the foreboding sense of dread permeates the film as it did for me reading the short story...and I certainly believed that THAT kind of brilliance went it's way with Murneau.  Even the various soundtracks are inspired, although on my sound system the ""Mythoscope"", while haunting, didn't sound as good as the regular track, but I suppose that's part of the ambiance of it appearing to be a ""discovered"" silent film.

Overall, however, I say with no reservation that this film is an amazing work of art...a tip of my hat to those who created this.

Now, for those of you who may not be fans of Lovecraft or are expecting a typical horror fest or ""Clash of the Titans"" type special effects, you would likely be better off moving along, but if you're a student of horror cinema and can appreciate palpable dread with an open mind, you owe yourself a screening of this one.",1284249600,4,1654,4.552188552188552

Still, I like it. For once, mood plays the main part in a movie and not gore. It would have to in an accurate re-creation because the terror of the Cthulhu in Lovecraft's story is nearly all mood. In fact, the threat of the Cthulhu is far more psychological than physical. Even when a freighter's crew gets chased by a Cthulhu in the Pacific. In addition, that it is a silent film, which requires overacting, leaves some distance between us and any horrors. I judge both that it is mood driven and there is some distance a plus although others might judge them a minus.",1282435200,,737,4.386861313868613
2437938,4,B000BQTC98,"We're spoiled with Industrial Light and Magic's sorcery and CGI effects.  This movie is an example of what can be done with the most basic tools of film-making; silent black and white.  The music is austere and true to the instruments commonly in use in the 1920s (no electronics, not even a theramin), the effects are almost non-existant.  Despite these limits, and the relative brevity (46 min), suspence builds, and the creepy vibe steadily escalates.

A man stumbles onto critical elements of a terrible secret from before the dawn of humanity.  Bizarre, ancient artifacts and contemporary nightmares lead him to an unspeakable truth and a threat to the existance and sanity of all mankind.

A must for Lovecraft fans, and an excellent flick for horror fans of any stripe.

The silent movie feel suits the material very well. The acting is serviceable but in keeping with the overall tone of the film. In the end this is a very suitable telling of Lovecraft's classic story.

All that being said, to make the purchase of the film worthwhile you really have to be Lovecraft devotee. I could see where someone new to Lovecraft might not ""get"" the film. Previous reviewers are correct in their criticism of the special effects. While the Cthulhu monster fits into the overall feel of the film, it lacks the terrifying zing modern audiences have come to expect in their onscreen terrors.",1276128000,2,863,4.633986928104576
2437941,5,B000BQTC98,"So, having a bit of spare time and an obsession with silent movies since I first saw a Buster Keaton film in its entirety... in a theater... with a live organ player... I watched the Call of Cthulhu, a modern rendition of the short story by H.P. Lovecraft done in a film style strongly reminiscent of 1920's cinema.

Now you might be thinking, ""Wait... What?"" The movie is silent  and uses primarily film techniques of the 1920's but was made using modern cameras and occasional digital image compositing. The result is very, very close to period in image quality. One has to look closely and know what you are looking for to spot the tiny differences in picture quality and lens focus. As a way of making a low budget movie look good and not low budget, it works incredibly well.

I thought that the unusual choice of film style suited the story told. I'd be lying if I said I was overly familiar with the source material (it's been a while since I read it), but I thought that the presentation of things going strangely awry in a series of events that seem unrelated until one man starts piecing things together worked better without sound or color. I like how the truth of where he actually ended up as a result of his curiosity was left until the end. The shots of him hesitating with the last piece of his picture puzzle are also an excellent manifestation of his internal conflicts. The limitations of the style put a lot of the suspension of disbelief on the characters rather than pretty imagery. The acting is pretty awesome.

I do not usually mention DVD features in reviews because I think that the story of the film itself should take primary importance and  rightfully so. However, because this is a film where the camera's microphone was on during the shooting and it's easier for actors to actually say improvised lines rather than mouth words silently, there are monologues... Hilarious, quoteable monologues. Also the little ""making of"" feature is pretty funny as well.

This was an awesomely watchable film and I love it immensely.'",1273449600,4,2050,4.664819944598338

2437947,5,B000BQTC98,"Don't let the rather lurid & out of focus [left] poster fool you, this is an extraordinarily splendid interpretation of the HP Lovecraft masterpiece. It is lovingly crafted & elegantly produced by the H.P. Lovecraft Historic Society. I love the term for the special technique used in the film ""Mythoscope.""

It is a black & white silent film with a specifically orchestrated music score--a score that is a masterpiece in itself. I can visualize people who haven't seen the movie, sort of scratching their heads and thinking, ""What? I silent film in the 21st century?!!! You must be nuts."" That's possible, but it's one of those things that has to be experienced to appreciate just what a raving artistic success THE CALL OF CTHULHU is.

It's wonderful & represents all the central themes of HPL.

There's the human-marine biological transmorphism, the hints of secret manuscripts & other works of magic, the feeling of sinking into a nightmarish state in which the dark side increasingly overcomes the day world of light, and a sinister reality sometimes called Typhonian Gnosis. There is a definite link in Lovecraft's artistic vision of these primordial forces (that have their origin in outer space) with the philosophy of Jane Roberts (Seth Speaks, etc.) Roberts describes our everyday, conscious personality as just the tip of a psychic iceberg, and at deeper levels we not only function as other personalities, but that we are interconnected to these deeper levels with other people, collectively forming a super-persona. The main difference is, where Jane Roberts teaching are decidedly positive, Lovecraft's vision is, if not completely negative, is often frightening & monstrous.

The Gnostic Pagan Tradition termed this hidden consciousness & archaic forces daemonic reality. It was suggested that, in an allegorical sense, darkness is essential to give form to Light.

This complex system is at the basis of Lovecraft's work, and THE CALL OF CTHULHU is no exception. That this system effortlessly weaves in and out of interconnected stories & times all within the span of 47 minutes is an outright miracle (if one can use ""miracle"" darkly). When the viewer experiences the film in all its complexity, one comes to understand why words (as in film parlance ""talkies"") would only be distracting. I don't believe that the decision to make a ""silent"" film was really one of choice, but more of necessity. It couldn't be any other way.

There are 2 scenes that really gripped my imagination. The first one was a scene in bayou  country where a sort of dark Sabbath was taking place. It was eerie, frightening & magnificent. The second scene was towards the end of the movie. A small group of sailors land on a mysterious island in pursuit of the meaning of the evil relic that seems to have caught them in its dark--as it has all others who have had the misfortune of being associated with it. This island scene is staged on an expressionist set accentuating the forbidden nature of the environment. Keeping in line with the expressionist background, the sailors are choreographed in their movements & reactions. The viewer gets a ""feel"" of the sailor's personalities in just a few frames. They are very sympathetic--which makes their ultimate fate much more chilling.

I viewed THE CALL OF CTHULHU 4 times in 2 days.

2437950,5,B000BQTC98,"I bought this with some reservations... after all, how good could a silent version really be? The answer I give now is ""exceptionally good""!

""The Call of Cthulhu"" is unquestionably the most faithful adaptation of Lovecraft's work to date, and very effectively conveys the weirdness and horror of the story. The choice of making this a silent film was inspired, and suits the tale perfectly. I especially enjoyed the third act, which eschews intertitles entirely in revealing the terrible fate of the Emma's crew. The music and silent acting in this sequence is the best of the film, and even the titular terror himself is wonderfully realized and surprisingly effective.

If you're on the fence about this because it is silent, don't be. This outshines any other Mythos adaptation you've seen. ""The Call of Cthulhu"" is a marvelous film, and I recommend it highly.",1245283200,,864,4.993055555555555
2437951,5,B000BQTC98,"I do not want to rehash all the excellent things in the reviews of my fellows. But I too exult that we finally have an adaptation of a Lovecraft story that cleaves almost precisely to the story. (The only major changes in the story being making Thurston, the narrator, an inmate of an insame asylum, and his uncle dying in bed rather than from what is probably an assassin in the form of a ""Lascar"" bumping him on the street.)

For having been made on so small a budget, its realization of the more fantastic elements in the story-- the risen city of R'lyeh, and Great Cthulhu him(it?)self, are splendid. The expressionistic geometries of R'lyeh are admirably brought out.  And as an added bonus, the filmakers actually went to Providence and filmed at the real Fleur-de-Lis Building,  so vividly described in the story (and one can see how true Lovecraft's judgment of its style is!).

In my opinion, the many previous ""adaptations"" from Lovecraft have ranged from abysmal to fair; the best, perhaps, though again not being totally true to the stories, being two segments on NIGHT GALLERY-- their rendition of ""Pickman's Model"" and ""Cool Air"".  Among film adaptations, many have been wretched. In fact, some of the most Lovecraftian films have been only just that-- ""Lovecraftian"" rather an an adaption of a specific story;  a good example being GHOSTBUSTERS, minus the broad comedy elements.  Another is THE THING, adapyted from a story (""Who Goes There?"") itself inspired and party adapted from what is arguably one of Lovecraft's greatest, ""At the Mountains of Madness"". Even AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON was extremely Lovecraftian, more so than actual film adaptations of his work (till now, at least!).

Anyhow: HIGHLY recommended even to real aficionadoes of the master; we can only wait with baited breath for the release of the HPLHS's next work, said to be an adaptation of ""The Whisperer in Darkness"", done in the style of a 1930s Universal horror film.

There aren't any high tech CGI monsters here either, just good old fashioned stop-motion animation which is extremely well done which also adds to the film's appeal and its feeling of authenticity. The film clocks in at a brief 45 minutes or so, but there are at least that many minutes of special features which are just as much fun to watch as the movie is. The story concerns a young man who is called upon to manage his dying uncle's estate and in the course of discharging his duties he comes across some mysterious papers detailing his uncle's lifelong obsession with the bizarre and secretive Cthulhu Cult. Before he knows it the young man is drawn into the mystery himself and his uncle's obsession becomes his own. THE CALL OF CTHULHU is a well-crafted work of love that should be seen by every fan of the genre. On second thought, don't just rent it--BUY it!",1241222400,2,1256,4.662162162162162

2437954,4,B000BQTC98,"I've always loved scary stories. One of the few positive memories I have from my childhood was staying up with my father and watching classic Universal monster movies in a rocking chair. I loved scary comics like CREEPY and EERIE and monster comics like Marvel's WEREWOLF BY NIGHT (I remember, when I was about 9 or so, scrambling around the desolation of our suburban neighborhood by moonlight in a torn shirt pretending I was the werewolf). I could quote Edgar Allen Poe, and read all the horror I could get hands on from DRACULA to ""The Monkey's Paw"" to SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES. Well, I read most things I could get my hands on. But horror was among my favorites.

The first fiction I ever read that actually scared me, though, was H.P. Lovecraft's story ""The Dunwich Horror."" This tale offered up an unspeakable invisible horror terrorizing a New England landscape that took root in my imagination with such force that I remember laying in my dark room at night, wanting to sleep, but watching the window waiting to see a thing I could not see...which of course doesn't make sense, but to my kid's mind it sure did.

That tale, I found out, was just one in Lovecraft's cycle of stories that are known as the Cthulhu Mythos. These stories tell us that beyond our ken, out in the darkness of space or in the depths of the sea or in other dimensions, ancient gods older than time are hungrily waiting to get back to our world and destroy our reality. Chief among them is the sleeping god Cthulhu...

Lovecraft's work has been highly influential, and Cthulhu and other elements from the mythos have appeared widely in other creator's work. Neil Gaiman and Stephen King have written tales involving these ancient evils, as have Robert E. Howard, Robert Bloch, and Ramsey Campbell. Rod Serling's NIGHT GALLERY adapted some of Lovecraft's work, the creators of the film ALIEN cited Lovecraft as an influence, and The Simpsons and Jon Stewart have made Cthulhu references. A huge library of Lovecraftian material for roleplaying games (traditional face-to-face games, not video) exists, springing from Chaosium's classic CALL OF CTHULHU (titled after one of the original stories). Lovecraft allusions pop up in the songs of Black Sabbath and Metallica. There have been Cthulhu video games, like ""Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth"", and many, many bits of lore and homage in games from ""Alone in the Dark"" to ""World of Warcraft."" Mike Mignola's Hellboy, both in comics and in film, draws heavily on the Cthulhu Mythos.

And there have been movies. Stuart Gordon's RE-ANIMATOR and FROM BEYOND are popular adaptations of Lovecraft's work, though they supply an over-the-top gore and campiness that are a far cry from the humorless, dark terror of the original tales. Gordon's DAGON, an adaptation of ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth,"" was far more effective, and creepy, telling the tale of a coastal village overrun by the cult of Dagon, one of the ancient gods who turns his followers into mutated fish-folk.

""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" is one of my favorite Lovecraft stories, and DAGON is my favorite Lovecraft film. I like the Dagon stuff so much, in fact, that the evil threat in my  novel DOC WILDE AND THE FROGS OF DOOM is an in-the-face homage to the fish god and his followers. The book's as much a love letter to Lovecraft as it is to Doc Savage.

Tonight, I watched one of the more recent films based on Lovecraft's work, 2005's THE CALL OF CTHULHU, based directly on H.P. Lovecraft's 1926 short story. This flick, a selection at both the Sundance Film Festival and the Seattle International Film Festival, was produced by the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society. It's not just a perfect rendition of Lovecraft's tale, it's brilliantly made in the style of a 1920s black and white silent film, the basic conceit seeming to be ""what would a film of the story be like if it had been made when the story was published?"" The conceit works not just for novelty's sake and atmosphere, it allows the low budget special effects to shine, resulting in a stylistic, almost German Expressionistic, feel that really suits the story.

This movie works perfectly. I can't recommend it highly enough, both as a Lovecraft adaptation and a work of film art. Apparently the filmmakers are currently at work on a followup, THE WHISPERER IN DARKNESS, based on Lovecraft's 1931 story. The producers are continuing their strategy of filming according to the style of the time the story was published, so this one will also be in black and white, but will be a talkie. It's supposed to be out some time this year. In the meantime, get your hands on THE CALL OF CTHULHU, it's a treat.",1236988800,3,4675,4.784386617100372
2437955,5,B000BQTC98,"When I first discovered H.P.Lovecraft in my early teens, I was ambushed - I'd not known such writing even existed - and before the night was through, not only had I finished the slim collection of stories, but I sat, bolt upright in the middle of bed, laughing at myself but not yet daring to stick so much as a toe out from under the covers on the slight chance some tentacled Eldritch creature lay beneath me, fetally curled and waiting.  That was the power of Lovecraft.

Sadly it is true that all things pass away, and though I still remember fondly the nauseous horror and gangrene infested foetid smelling tales of the Old Ones, those stories just don't hold the charm for me that they once did.  I don't think the rigid grooves of my older brain are capable of projecting that kind of visceral imagery anymore.  Maybe that's why, over the years, I've never stopped hoping for a faithul adaptation of Lovecraft's works on film, something to compare to even a fraction of what my mind's eye saw at thirteen.

How excrutiatingly long that wait has been (Beyond the Wall of Sleep, anyone?).  And even those filmmakers that attempted it, no matter whether a direct translation or an homage, the film always suffered from at least one of two things, if not both - either the adaptation was poor, or, in the end, they had to show the monster.  And what studio, what creator could possibly portray these monstrosities and infuse them with the shattering effect Lovecraft was able to tease out of my imagination?  None.  No one can.  But 'Call of Cthulhu' is as close as I'll probably ever see in my lifetime.

In the end, horror as a genre is a partnership between creator and viewer.  A commitment.  Usually, as I sit down to watch a movie, the director has my initial investment up front - it's up to him to lose me, and make me forget I'm supposed to be suspending my belief.  The creators of 'Cthulhu' must have been aware of that, or lucked into it by budget constraints, because as a silent film, the viewer must invest even more heavily right from the beginning.  From that point, though, they skillfully leap over the first hurdle in filming Lovecraft's work - the adaptation.  Faithfully, they follow the strange story of a man obsessed with a shadowy cult that his great uncle had been tracking for years prior to his death.  Strange events are collated and pieced together by the nephew (executor of his great uncle's estate) until a frightful picture emerges of an alien god who once walked the Earth, and the cultists' efforts to raise him again.

This is where the creators face the second problem - how to show the monster.  There are fans and casual watchers of this film who will not like the way that Cthulhu was created for the screen.  In my mind, it was maybe one of the only ways *to* do it.  The more real filmmakers have tried to make their images of the 'Old Ones', the less believable they are.  By use of the stop motion techniques, once again, I was required to lend a hand with my own imagination, which is where the true picture (or sensation perhaps) of dead Cthulhu really dreams in his sunken city of R'lyeh.  Does the technique make it believable?  Of course not.  That would be one hell of a movie to convince me of a 25 ft tentacle-faced alien nightmare rising out of the sea.  I'd pay good money for that.

But what the creators have done is set up the possibility - if the viewer allows it and, more importantly, wants it - where one's imagination can go hand in hand with the film, complementing it and bringing the tension and creepiness to a higher level than just film alone.  That's the true success of this film - whether intentional or not.  It's as though the filmmakers fell into a perfect storm of budget constraints and dedicated people - the making of feature is one of the most interesting I've ever watched.  From the musical score (fantastic) to the acting (mostly excellent) to the adaptation (only purists will find fault here), this group of enthusiasts have accomplished what no one else (from what I've seen) has been able to - a credible tribute to Lovecraft's work.

A quick note to those unfamiliar with Lovecraft - though you may not have the background to appreciate this film on the level some of his fans might, this is still a highly enjoyable film.  Yes, it's in black and white, and yes, it's silent.  It was also filmed with almost no money, so the effects will reflect that too.  But if you have a little patience, and let yourself go, this is a simple treat of a movie, one that engages the viewer instead of bombarding him with sound and flashing lights, and one who's payoff is directly proportional to your investment.",1236729600,3,4691,4.5386444708680145
2437956,4,B000BQTC98,"""The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.""

Lovecraft</a>&nbsp;is that the author's mind-bending prose simply would not translate into spoken dialogue or voiceover.  Indeed, the only man worthy to speak such words aloud passed on many years ago.  But even if Vincent Price were still with us, seeing Lovecraft's genius plastered across the screen in black and white accompanied by a lush classical soundtrack just seems the perfect way to pay homage to a master.  Indeed, every frame of this film is a labor of love.  Love for the author, love for classic science fiction and horror, love for the tried-and-true filmmaking techniques that have thrilled us since the advent of cinema.  After all, what could be more true to a work of fiction than to adapt it using the same techniques available at the time it was written (1926)?  Consider this a must-see for fans of the old-school or students of cinema.

The story revolves around a bizarre cult worshiping a deity named (can you guess?) Cthulhu.  The protagonists investigate and wind up setting sail for the source.  What they find is a living, breathing nightmare.  Fans of stop-motion animation, brace yourselves for a nerdgasm because&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong/dp/B00003CXAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong</a>&nbsp;ain't got sh!+ on him.  But for as low-budget as this production is, it works on most every level assuming you are not a heathen who sniffs at the thought of a black-and-white film with dialogue cards.

The film is a very short 47 minutes. While this is a perfect length to avoid padding the story, it does make for a poor bargain as far as DVD prices go.  Thankfully, there are some killer bonus features.  First off: several deleted shots featuring mighty Cthulhu in glorious full-color.  It's like porn for stop-motion animation fans and every shot's a money shot.  Sorry, was that too gross?  Moving on.  There is also a color version of a ranting scene with full audio to capture the actual performance of the actors.  This is made awesome by the fact that the ranting actor is not speaking lines from ""The Call of Cthulhu"" at all, but reciting Dwight Frye's dialogue from the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula/dp/B000GPIPSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula</a>.

So gather around, kiddies, and let uncle trashy tell you about the good old days before directors had to rely on CG, vapid celebrities, and shameless sex appeal to cover up their shortcomings as filmmakers.  They used to have things called ""ideas"" and ""creativity"".  There even used to be people who made the kind of movies they actually wanted to see just because they liked to; not only so that they could make 100 million dollars on opening weekend.  I know this is all long ago and far away, but it's great to be reminded of those times now and again.  ""Call of Cthulhu"" does exactly that.",1231113600,4,3811,5.289036544850498
2437957,5,B000BQTC98,"While H.P. Lovecraft is one of the 20th Century's most respected horror writers even though his acclaim took decades to materialize, there are a suprisingly small number of films that are based on his work.  He is quite simply not a very filmable writer because much of his work is devoted to monstrosities that the feeble human mind cannot comprehend without going insane.  Anyone who tries to make a movie with that in mind is setting themselves up for failure with at least half the audience - and possibly a tar and feathering from the other half.  And let's face it, some of these Lovecraft fans are fanatical.

Yet sometimes fanatics are the only people for the job.  Take the Howard Phillips Lovecraft Historical Society.  On paper, they are rank amateurs when it comes to filmmaking.  Worse than that, they have no studio backing for production and promotion.  Sounds like a recipe for disaster except for a couple of added ingredients - love and determination.  Seeing their treatment of the classic HPL story is yet another reminder of why I can't stand much of Hollywood tries to pass of as horror nowadays.  Rarely have I seen anything so respectful of the source material.

What they did was film the story like a 1920s silent movie with subtitles.  Considering the almost nonexistent resources the crew had to work with when you compare it to the umpteenth-thousandth PG-13 remake, the results are staggering.  Some modern audiences who have been spoiled by all the CGI may be little miffed by the stop-motion Cthulhu, but I thought it was neat how they envisioned how a 1920s filmmaker would do ol' Tentacle Face.  I'm not going to describe the special effects or set design processes since that would spoil the mystery for potential viewers, but what I will say that it makes me respect the old-school effects crews that much more for their imagination and hard work.  I also thought the sound track was amazing by being majestic, hypnotic, and bone chilling.  It stinks that it isn't for sale anywhere that I know of.

This is what the moviemaking world needs more of - people who love what they do.  It probably won't put a stop to all the PG13 remakes made by accountants who's idea of horror is golfing a bad game in front of the studio head.  What it is however is one film that can't be put into the watered down filth genre we have been subjected to for years.  One film may not sound like much, but when the right thing is done - that one film gets my respect.",1229990400,2,2484,4.61503416856492
2437958,5,B000BQTC98,This is by far the best film adaptation of Lovecraft's fiction I've ever seen. It's done in the manner of black & white silent films but with better quality than that era could manage. The story was stuck to religiously and nothing was added for profit motive. My only suggestion would be to put two stories per disc since they're short. That might help more people than just hardcore Lovecraft fans decide to buy them.,1226880000,,419,4.6
2437959,5,B000BQTC98,"Being a long-time fan of the Lovecraft stories, I have been nothing but disappointed with the attempts by Hollywood and others to put HPL's stories into celluloid (except for ""Dagon"", and even that is a little short of the mark).  I was given this DVD as a gift, and have to say that I was skeptical of what I would find inside.  But, after reviewing all the content on the DVD, and watching the film, I saw what I know many other reviewers see here.  This film was nothing short of a labor of love from a group of dedicated HPL fans.

To me, as a fan of sci-fi and some horror genres, sometimes the only way you get a film that stands up is to have people with dedication to the original material be involved, and have control of what actually ends up in the release.

This film is an example of that.

So, while my review is short compared to some, I can say this.  If you are a fan of indie film, and also a fan of HPL and his works, this film will not disappoint you in any way.  It is true to the story, and the delivery of the story on film is nothing short of inspired.

2437961,5,B000BQTC98,"The H.P.Lovecraft Historical Society's adaptation of the classis horror story The Call Of Cthulhu is probably the most clever and brilliant attempt at trying to bring to cinema a story that most filmmakers would think almost impossible to film, and it is a successful one at that.

Using both a mixture of modern and early film making technique, the story is presented in a classic silent film format, using limited special effects, but loads and loads of atmosphere.  The result is a dreamlike presentation that starts off as a mystery and ends as the ultimate in horror.  The film also succeeds in filling in all the terror of this story into less than 47 minutes.

In an age where modern film makers rely on big name stars, tons of CGI effects, and in the case of horror, buckets of spurting blood, the HPLHS pretty much abandons all of that, and instead lets the story itself shine forth. It is very clear the people who made this film love and respect the works of H.P. Lovecraft.

And they succeed wonderfully! The distancing effect of silent film actually makes it MORE convincing by creating a complete, self-contained world & atmosphere. And as for complaints about the deliberately primitive stop-motion animation for Cthulhu -- the recent version of King Kong certainly looked more realistic than the original ... but did it look more REAL? I don't think so. The old-fashioned approach lends a certain dreamlike (or in this case, nightmare-like) quality to the figure.

Might be heavy going for the non-enthusiast, due to the silent format (albeit with very atmospheric music) and a film style which is very reminiscent of 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' or maybe a mixture of 'Metropolis' and 'Nosferatu'!

All in all, it's worth seeing, and it's a cool idea, but it's just not great.  The dvd cover is more impressive than the actual film.  Sorry guys, good try.

And they pull it off.  The Call of Cthulhu nests many flash backs within flash backs, but manages to tell the story not just acceptably, but incredibly, remarkably well.  The use of vintage effects and modern (some) methods creates a wonderful experience that I would recommend to any fan of silent film, H.P. Lovecraft, or well made movies.

This one is a winner.",1197331200,3,540,4.631578947368421
2437977,4,B000BQTC98,"H.P. Lovecraft is often credited with launching the true horror genre we know today. Many claim him as an inspiration, including the current master of dark dreams Stephen King. Difficulties in bringing his cerebral literary content to the silver screen have been mentioned time and again, and with good reason. How can you explain a man's dream experiences that even he can't explain?

When I learned that a society dedicated to Lovecraft's work decided to take on a movie version of his most famous story, THE CALL OF CTHULHU, I cringed. How could a small group of people do justice to such a magnificent piece of horror fiction?

Well the cast and crew do it justice even if the script fails a bit. The black-and-white silent picture theme went exceptionally well with the telling of a tale so old (1920s). The sets were equally impressive, especially the pivotal dreamscapes and the retelling of the Pacific Island that belonged to Cthulhu, this terrible being from the beginning of time.

Since not many of the cast were actually established actors, it was an excellent idea to do a homage to the silent film era, too. Undoubtedly, if forced to do a modern-style film of Lovecraft's story, they would've failed miserably. But as it stands here, this film pays homage and respect to both old filming styles and a Lovecraftian feel.

It's also a blessing and a curse that the film is only 47 minutes long. The blessing is that most movie watchers of today couldn't handle a 90 - 120 minute silent film (or at least few could). The curse is that the script jumps around a lot. We move back three time-frames at one point, each time adding confusion for the viewer (""Where are we again?""). I realize that the crew wanted to remain true to Lovecraft's work, but cinema often takes liberties with the written word, and I feel this film could've benefitted from a bit of that as well.

Even so, this is a fresh piece of cinematic work that entertains and surprises. The special features on the DVD are also worth watching (except when the director is talking while eating a bag of potato chips), including commentaries from the cast and crew about this monumental undertaking from such a small band of dedicated Lovecraft lovers.",1195776000,3,2226,4.741602067183463

A lot of people have been very critical of the climax of the film, saying the the Cthulhu ""monster"" was very unrealistic looking.  The whole feel of the movie was supposed to be from the old days!

Not only does the HP Lovecraft Historical Society manage convincingly recreate the flavor of a 1920s silent movie, but they stick faithfully to the story of ""The Call of Cthulhu"" as HPL wrote it!

What an unprecedented concept, to do a screen adaptation of a literary work without grossly mangling and re-writing the original story...  Somebody should have done it long ago.  But the fact is, nobody has until now.

Lovecraft's stories are not easily made into movies, since they require non-Euclidian geometries, and weird visions that drive men insane. I doubt any modern special effects could do it justice, so a replica of a 1920s movie was definitely the right decision.

It's also a very faithful adaptation of the Lovecraft story, which is a godsend for those of us who grit their teeth every time a director takes liberties with a storyline. On seeing it for the first time I couldn't detect any deviance, but I'll read the story and check. If there are any changes from the story it's so minor that it doesn't matter.

There's just one little quibble that keeps me from giving it 5 stars, it's from the part where the protagonist is in Australia: They didn't have fluorescent tubes in the 1920s. The first mass produced fluorescent tubes came out in 1938. It may be subtle, but it really stood out for me the first time I watched it.",1191974400,2,1112,4.522388059701493
2437984,2,B000BQTC98,"As a fan of the works of H.P. Lovecraft I anticipated the release of Call of Cthulhu, but the results were dissapointing. The problem is that the original short story plays not as a story, but a synopsis of a larger more interesting story or novella. When you read it it implies that there is much  more to the story than what you read. The makers acted as a stenographer to the synopsis, rather than crafting the larger story that it implies, so when you watch it you think that's all there is to the story and nothing more. The movie simply isn't creepy or scary, because of the formal style of presentation. The silent movie technique, though sounding good on paper, actually distances the viewer from the story. As a viewer I feel one step further removed from the narrative than reading a second hand account from a journal. The movie should have gone the other direction and bring us closer to the events. On the technical side, they made odd choices, they used a phony miniature forest  where using miniatures were totally unnecessary. The sacrificial body looks like a GI Joe doll. The Cthulhu creature was fine but his lair looked like they ran out of money. I know there are those that champion indie films right or wrong, but just because it's independent that doesn't automatically make it good. In fact for those who hate Lovecraft movie adaptations in general, the ugly fact is that most of the Lovecraft adaptations were independently produced. Or those who automatically deride CG seem unaware that it is the artist not the tool, which make the product good or bad.",1191715200,4,1581,4.663082437275985

If you're a fan it's worth a look, and not just to snicker and disparage. Consider what the creators were aiming for and you'll see how much they were able to capture the hopelessness of Lovecraft's mythos; the sense of despair at being unable to stem the tide of the cult's influence.",1191456000,2,526,4.422680412371134
2437986,4,B000BQTC98,"There are basically two prevailing schools of thought regarding how a H.P. Lovecraft story should be adapted to the screen: 1) there is the Gordon/Yuzna method (see Re-Animator) which goes for camp and irreverence by basing a modern yarn very loosely on a Lovecraft original; 2) there are the purists whose spirited amateur attempts (sometimes silent, usually black & white and ALWAY set in the 1920s) constitute the fare at HPL film festivals.

The latter camp, despite an unswavering fidelity and admirable affection for Lovecraft's works, rarely produce anything that doesn't come off as forced and hoakey. These attempts don't even have the benefit of campiness enjoyed by the delightfully goofy Re-Animator or From Beyond because they take themselves way to seriously to be deliberately funny.

The Call of Cthulhu, however, breaks this mold. For the first time I feel, watching this, that I am watching a genuine silent movie. The people who put this production together took all of the enthusiasm of the afore-mentioned paradigm and somehow brought to bear a variety of skill sets that have hither-to eluded this niche sub-genre. The result is the first film that I can say (in my humble opinion) really deserves to have the name ""Cthulhu"" in its title.

If you are a huge HPL fan (like me) and have longed for a serious and well-done adaptation of an original Lovecraft story (let alone his most iconic tale) you would do youself a great service to buy this DVD and watch it late at night.

The Lovecraft Preservation Society really put forth an effort to make a faithful Lovecraft film, which as we all know, never really happens.  The decision to do this in the old silent film style is a nice choice and fitting to the story.  You can tell that the film was made recently because of the quality(and clarity) of the film used, regardless of attempts to show aging.  There's just no substitiute for aged film like real aged film, but who wants to have this film sit around and corrode for 70 years before releasing it?  That's not a complaint by any means.  Everything else-the lighting, the camerawork, the acting-is dead on, just fabulous.  You know that Hollywood would never get within five hundred miles of a project like this(unless it was a two and a half hour cgi packed action extravaganza directed by Michael Bay and starring Vin Diesel), but the recent Grindhouse has taught us that when someone tries to do a film in the style or genre of a bygone era, no one understands it, thinks it's dumb, and it flops.  Fortunately Cthulhu is a much more hush hush production made on a shoestring and won't have to worry about box office bombing.  It was made for fans by fans(I mean, who the hell's really gonna watch this other than Lovecraft fans?), and it's nice to know that things like this still happen in the film world.  If you like the Lovecraft story or are a Lovecraft fan, this film should be a no brainer for you.  We all know that Lovecraft translates differently from reader to reader, so folks may not consider this a perfect adaptation.  But it is very accurate and very well done.

And the idea of a silent movie seemed a little precious, trying to emulate the era of the stories themselves (or even a bit before them, actually).

But it turned out really well, and very entertaining. The bit on the island moved fast and was very well done, with the expressionistic cityscape, the groovy stop-motion monster, and my favorite part, where one of the crew manages a seemingly-impossible demise straight out of the book. There were lots of clever little touches, a lot of care and effort, and while somewhat short, there was never any feeling like any extra would've added much. The effects were just cheesy enough to be fun, but not so over-the-top as to be condescending or snide; enough affection for the source material to keep is straight, but still with a sense of fun.

2437995,5,B000BQTC98,"If you know what my title means (i.e. ""In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming"") then chances are you were hooked on H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos long ago, in which case this film really is meant for you. There have been so many film adaptations of Lovecraft's work and themes that there is even a Lovecraft film festival every year in Portland, OR; yet none of them have seemed to get exactly right the sort of nameless horror and ineffable dread that Lovecraft writes about so memorably in his stories. (How could they? Any attempt to match his effects is ultimately doomed to failure since his point always has to do with a kind of sublimity in horror that cannot be matched on the screen.) Probably the most ingenious method to circumvent this is this film, which takes the most central story to his entire mythos and imagines it in the filmic terms Lovecraft himself might have been familiar with when the story was written in 1926, presenting the story as a silent film with period costumes and sets, scratchy film stock, stop-motion animation (a la the original Twenties version of THE LOST WORLD), and a very effective symphonic score (available either in high-fidelity on the DVD or in ""Mythosound,"" which reproduces the mono effects of the period). The result comments not only ingeniously on Lovecraft and the Cthulhu mythos but also on early film as a genre, and suggests that the two might have been mutually influenced by some of the same ideas (such as shown in post-Impressionism--the film begins with the execution of a jigsaw puzzle of van Gogh's ""The Starry Night""--and German Expressionism). This is what indie film should do--challenge our expectations and make us see things in a new way, while simultaneously providing a rattling good show.",1181520000,4,1777,4.867986798679868

It achieves it's goal of communicating a VERY ""unfilmable"" story into a cohesive, well structured film that absolutely 110% captures Lovecraft's vision.  I can only imagine what kind mind torturing film this would have been if Hollywood had been involved, made it color, added 10,000 digital effects, etc.... it would SUCK so hard, the theaters would develop black-holes!  Being a silent film works SO well in this movie because, in the story, there isn't alot of dialogue - it's all imagery and impressions.

I was excited to see this movie, and to say I was disappointed would be more than an understatement. When I saw the movie's representation of Cthulhu, I almost had physical symptoms of nausea at the injustice the filmmakers perpetrated against HPL. I could nearly hear Ray Harryhausen roll in his grave.

I would recommend this movie to use as a coaster. I've seen better infomercials. I've seen silent films (e.g. ""Metropolis"") and know they were trying* for that silent film feel, but sorry, you all did not get it.

2438000,5,B000BQTC98,"When I saw this listed as a DVD release I was hesitant but also elated because, as far as a lifetime of wishes are concerned, I have always wanted a Lovecratian tale that didn't make me wonder why I bothered watching Lovecraftian tales in the first place. The things I had heard about the construction of the movie were somewhat soothing as I paced the floor with memories of Cthulhu Mansion and the like, hoping for the best and maybe even more. I kept remembering how many filmmakers said that doing Call of Cthulhu was impossible because it would require too much to do correctly, and how that had scared off so many from making an effort. Then I FINALLY watched  the movie and saw that the makers of Call of Cthulhu had managed to silence so many a critic because (1) they did the source material a great amount of justice in the way they present it (2) they re-imagined the things people have been trying to do for a long time and did not get caught up in trying to make an expensive movie with a little flash of ""monster"" because they understood the aforementioned source material and (3) they did something different and attempted to capture an entire mood instead of a partial emotions. The movie basically sidestepped a lot of issues thrown at it in the now by taking the film out of the now and placing it where it belonged - in the 1920s. And it is so good to say that, for once, I didn't cringe when I saw the name ""Lovecraft"" connected with a story.

The one really interesting thing about this movie was the fact that the film was shot as a silent piece (with musical overlay), allowing the viewer the feel of the 20's and the world that story belonged to. The way the people were portrayed, the way the cultists were portrayed, and even the way some of the props were made really felt like something that belonged to something older (and perhaps better in terms of conception, considering many of the themes seen in modern movies) and added the ambiance of a world wide open to new and horrific discoveries. There was this feeling that the movie projected of a world that existed outside that of the examined world, allowing cults to thrive in the shadows and islands to exist in the heart of the still-vast ocean. This worked beautifully with the ""when"" of the film, with some of the tale examining evidence as far back as 1870. Personally I attribute a lot of that to the way the material was presented, leaving a lot of today's technology behind and aiming for something that a least allowed for a much wider and unexamined world. This is not to say that there was no modern appeal to the movie - far from that, in fact. There were modern tones hidden in the arrangements of shots and in some of the additional props, giving the movie a great mix of the ""then and now"" without it being too overt. This meant that the dream sequences really had a disconcerting feel, perhaps not frightening in a modern sense of the word but really conveying the source behind all the dreams and working toward the overall goal. The same goes for the island sequences and the times Cthulhu - I don't want to say much on Cthulhu but I have to say that I enjoyed the things that came from something so beloved in almost every horror circle and so crucial to this tale.

Additionally, the DVD has a few things on it worth mentioning. First, the insert itself is entertaining and explains the people behind the effort and allows one to check into buying a ""movie prop of terror."" The disc itself contains some deleted pieces, a trailer, and one thing I really liked - access to the prop Bulletin that appears in the movie via computer for both reading leisure AND printing (provided you can use Adobe). It also has intertitles in 24 languages, something I commend as well because everyone should know about poor Chtulhu's plight. You basically get 47 minutes of beauty that does a real amount of justice like this to the tale of old ones, taking you beyond the modicum of blah movies and finally landing you in the middle of a story that has needed to be told since - well, let's just say I never thought I would see it on DVD and am happy to get to review it here.

and garages, the authors shoot a film, silent and

expressionist, as if it had been released at the time

of Lovecraft, recreating both Providence in the 20's

and the non-euclidean megaliths of R'lyeh. This

straordinary effort, made by amateurs filmmakers,

flows in a peculiar work, enthusiastic and deeply

devoted to the original subject. Andrew Leman, Sean

Branney and the rest of the HPLHS know very well the

arts contemporary to Lovecraft, because in the film

there are many details deserving a note: the art-deco

idol found in the swamp by inspector Legrasse (David

Mersault), the forced and futuristic perspectives of

the dreamviews, the prologue and the epilogue that

reminds the narrative frames typical of the silent

era.

""The call of Cthulhu"" becomes also a singular and

conscious tribute to the expressionist cinema, other

than a reflection on Lovecraft and his cinematic

adaptability, that this time seems particularly smart,

new and efficacious.

In few aspects the technical performance shows some

faults, even though one could also think to forget

them, due to the homage nature of the movie and its

fully amateur production. The stop-motion Cthulhu, for

example, is quite inefficacious as a monster and

nearly degrades the emotional apex of the story.

Anyway, if we consider it as if it had been created in

the 20's, we can also skip over its aspect and accept

it as a technological quotation, even if a deeper

consideration on its trustworthyness would have raised

further the movie level. Another main defect, that

however lacks any justification, is photography:

scarcely effective, with a very poor greyscale,

sometimes too artificial and ""digital"", with a final

effect of flat shots - and this a pity, because the

camera work is amazing. Some scenografic tricks, like

the restless cloth that stands for the ocean, are

quite ridiculous, but even in this case the

technological quotation hypothesis can be true.

Leaving these defects off, also because we can partly

excuse them, over all comes out the work made by the

screenwriter Sean Branney, that represents one of the

best points for The call of Cthulhu. The novel's main

aspects are adopted with great care and there are also

some famous Lovecraft quotations, pronounced by a

character or written among missive lines. Some

sequences are highly symbolic, like Wilcox's dreams

that resemble the hypnagogies of ""The student of Praga

(S. Rye, 1913)"", or the asylum scenario, that is

similar to that of ""The cabinet of dr. Caligari (1920,

R. Wiene)"". Absolutely beautiful is the opening shot,

where the camera spins over the ""Starry night"" puzzle,

that preludes to the ""piecing together"" of the

investigation about which the man is going to tell. In

the ending, the puzzle game is broken by the same

character, because his mind evidently doesn't want to

""correlate all its contents"" any more and returns to

the ""placid island of ignorance in the midst of black

seas of infinity"", represented by a dark doorway into

which he is carried on his wheelchair.

The prologue and the epilogue of TCOC cite ""The

cabinet of dr. Caligari"" and ask the same questions of

the Wiene's movie to the spectator: what we have seen

is only a wicked fancy, the dream of a madman, or the

narrator is sane and we can only ""flee from the light

into the peace and safety of a new dark age""?.

This ""Call of Cthulhu"" from the HPLHS is fully devoted

to the original novel, but primarily to Lovecraft's

poetics and Weltanschauung.

No special effects to speak of (some brief stop-action animation). In fact, I think in some scenes they were deliberately making sure you knew that it WAS fake: e.g. when they're in the rowboat, it wouldn't be too hard to have the rowboat actually on water, but they make sure you can tell it's on sheets that are being moved up and down to look like water.

2438006,5,B000BQTC98,"I have just viewed the film and thought that it was excellent.  It did a fine job of capturing the feel and atmosphere of Lovecraft's stories in general, as well as being fateful to The Call of Cthulhu in particular.

I was also impressed with the skill in which the film was crafted.  These folks did so much with so little!  This became especially apparent to me after I watched the ""making of"" feature.  The R'lyeh set and models translated very well, transporting one to another world.  The other set piece that stood out was the swamp.  That sequence was just great, I felt like I was watching a classic horror film from years gone by, and yet, it also had a surreal quality to it.  The Alert and other sequences on the water were also done well.  In fact, I didn't consciously register the fact that the cast wasn't on real water until I watched the behind-the-scenes.

On the whole, the cinematography was very effective, the chosen camera angles evoking a dramatic and creepy atmosphere.  The director made good use of light and shadow.  In particular, I liked the fact that Great Cthulhu was kept in the shadows (or, in some cases, ONLY being able to see his shadow).  This left more to the imagination, and gave the creature more impact.

The cast were all great, particularly Matt Foyer as The Man.  He was the epitome of the Lovecraftian protagonist: a sensitive intellectual who is at once repelled by, and yet drawn to, the horror he is discovering.  Oh, I almost forgot!  Clarence Henry Hunt was excellent as the unhinged cultist Castro.

I would go as far as saying that this version of Call of Cthuluh would exactly be as Lovecraft would have visualised it to be! Even though Stuart Gordon does a good job of transfering Lovecraft's stories into film he has to make changes in them to make them work in the new medium.

This filmatization follows the written story almost exactly - the filmmakers only remove some overtly racial parts which could be misinterpreted today. The film makers show they have understood both the written story and the medium of the silent movie.

While not scary, the film is distinctly creepy. The black and white and the shadowplay mirrors the various protagonist's search for truth. The shadows also allows the filmmakers to only hint at the horrors, thus enabling the imagination of the viewer to kick into action and fill in the dark areas.

The acting and the sceongraphy are on the whole excellent, with one or two exceptions - but nothing that detracts from the overall value of the film.

2438015,4,B000BQTC98,"The Call of Cthulhu, produced by the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society, is an interesting bit of amateur filmmaking. Much praise has been given for this silent film version of Lovecraft's short story, which is set in the 1920s.

It is an intriguing challenge: creating a black and white silent film for today's audience is a dicey proposition ; just look at all the iPoded simstim-heads out there, wearing white-wired headsets as a fashion statement. Then there is the one shoestring budget for an amateur production; how do you create special effects for a hypertechno-affectualized audience (probably still wearing their iPods)? It is a hard sell, and I am sure the audience draw for this is limited. But for those that can remove their iPods for a spell, enjoy some 'how the hell are we going to do that on this budget?' styled special effects,  and allow themselves to drift into a well-directed (by Andrew Leman) excursion into classic horror, the reward is there.

The opening credits are a fun homage to Universal Studios 1929 globe circled by biplane logo, combined with a retro-look text that evokes the opening credits of earlier horror films. The onscreen intertitles, used to convey dialog and narrate story points, are done with exacting period detail. Toward the end of the film, though, one or two intertitles were flashed on screen too quickly to be read properly (okay, at least by me, anyway).

While I can quibble with some things, like merchant marine sailors wearing clean, pressed clothes and spotlessly white and uncrumpled caps, and everybody, except for the Cthulhu swamp worshippers that is, looking so darn clean cut and unrumpled, the film overall is a wonderful work of art. It captures the building sense of terror in the story, and Lovecraft's fatalistic mood, as no other, more lavish, production has. This is a credit to the actors, whose performances are greatly enhanced by the lack of dialog sound, and superbly aided by the moody score.

As I watched this film, I was reminded of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari . Here, the use of close-ups and tightly framed shots, along with an occasional dutch shot (horizon not parallel to the frame), overshadow the low-budgeted sets. The island where the ill-fated crew meets the big C, with it's expressionistic, starkly angular landscaping, like the streets where Dr. Caligari and Cesare prowled, is imaginative and creepy.

The Tale of Inspector Legrasse segment of the film, which corresponds to the same section in the short story, is nicely handled on that one shoestring budget. David Mersault is a great choice to play Legrasse. His look and manner are spot-on, and the mist-shrouded swamp encounter with the ""indescribable horde of human abnormality"" worshippers of Cthulhu and the Great Old Ones, is an exciting mix of scoring, model and greenscreen work, and full-scale set design. The only fault I can find with the scene is that it lacks more kinetic energy in the fight scenes, both within the separate scenes themselves, and in how the scenes are intercut. What should be a bloody knock down and drag out affair comes off a little luke-warm. The lack of combatants--there's that small budget again--also minimizes the intensity of the confrontation.

The climactic confrontation between Cthulhu and the ill-fated sailors, The Madness from the Sea segment of the film corresponding to the same section in the short story, is another fine example of doing much with little. Again, model and greenscreen work, and imaginative, full-scale sets combine to realize the otherworldliness of Cthulhu and his ""hideous monolith-crowned citadel"" jutting up from the sea. The use of stop-motion to portray Cthulhu, for the most part, does not work well here, and should have been eschewed for a more shadowy, mostly hidden from view perspective of the thing that ""cannot be described - there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order.""

The documentary on the DVD describes the tenacity, angst, and artistic juryrigging that made this film a reality. It also provides an informative introduction to the Lovecraftianites that would not let a miniscule budget stand in their way. The Call of Cthulhu is an entertaining and faithful cinematic version of the classic story, and required viewing by any self-proclaimed Lovecraft aficianado.",1149552000,11,4403,5.097087378640777

Oh yes, there have been some feeble attempts that credit his work but really don't truthfully follow his story line, or others that liberally borrow from this writings without really connecting with the true and horrible terror behind his work.

In 'The Call of Cthulhu' we finally have an honest and trustworthy attempt to capture the true indescrible horror and nature of Lovecraft's work. Leave it to his true fans, the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society to do what the large Hollywood studios have refused, or been afraid to do. It is filmed in old-fashioned silent movie fashion, which is not only perfect for the time period being depicted, but also perfectly done. There is a haunting, dream-like quality to this film that is absolutely mesmerizing. One is ultimately left to ponder whether the images being viewed are on the television screen or within the inner recesses of your mind. Truly a one-of-a-kind production!

Let's be honest, the horrific images and happenings that Lovecraft's writings inspire could never be matched on film. The human imagination will always be far superior to the images that can be provided on celloid. This film made in old fashioned silent film format comes as close as anything I have seen so far. I still hold out the hope that sometime in the near future a large studio with a big budget and an inspired director will do justice to this tale like Peter Jackson did with 'Lord of the Rings.'

For me, the major problem here is that the last half of the film probably won't make much sense to anyone who isn't familiar with the source material. If you're not already a Lovecraft fan, this video probably won't work for you.

However, if you are a Lovecraft fan (and I am; he's practically my patron saint) this DVD is a must-have item. While the videomakers were just trying to work around the severe restrictions of a shoestring budget, the gimmick of making a faux silent film of the late 1920's works wonderfully and adds to the feeling of a dark secret emerging from the past. Moreover, it provides the perfect excuse for setting the film in Lovecraft's day rather than the modern era, and frankly I just don't think this story would work very well if it were set in contemporary times. Much of the videography is very striking. The special effects are crude, even amateurish at times, but a real silent film of that era probably would not have done much better. And the sets for the sunken city of R'leyh work! I never would have thought that someone with practically no budget to work with could communicated the feeling of a city with twisted geometry and distorted space and time so well. What is more, the voodoo orgy really does give the feeling of a primitive, bloody ritual. There are moments when it's obvious that this was shot on videotape rather than film, but fortunately they're not distracting or intrusive enough to break the illusion of watching an old, silent film.

The extras are very interesting and amusing, too. The ""making of"" documentary is more than half as long as the video itself, and the excerpts of Cthulhu emerging from his lair are interesting.

However, it is absolutely astonishing what the HPLHS crew has done with it!

 A story that could well have been stodgy and static (I've often thought it could best be realized as a one-man presentation, sans sfx!) was instead fluid, suspenseful, eerie; undoubtedly the best Lovecraft adaptation I have ever seen, far superior to all the ""professional"" productions of the Old Gent's work.

I have very little complaint with the acting; some reviews have mentioned wooden performers, but I could not disagree more with that assessment.  The scriptwriter has brilliantly solved the problems in bringing this story to the screen, beginning with the decision to make it a silent film!  I recall Dan O'Bannon once stating that he couldn't get beyond Cthulhu's appearance, but Branney's framing story and finale brings the tale to a satisfying, frisson-inducing end. The Lovecraft quotes at the finish have a delightfully chilling resonance, exactly what Lovecraft himself would have hoped for, I'm sure.

Cthulhu, seen only in brief glimpses and largely manifested through shadow and the reactions of the actors faced with the horror, could not have been more alien.  The animation process itself makes the entity bizarre and anomalous (see Outer Limits' ""Zanti Misfits"" or ""It Crawled Out of the Woodwork"" for other examples).

Only the fight scenes in the swamp seemed a bit ridiculous, quite stiff, underchoreographed, perhaps... but the slow crescendo of atmosphere during Castro's grim interrogation makes up for that in spades.

Just awesome.",1490313600,,323,4.406779661016949
8091132,5,B000BQTC98,"Perfect adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's 'The Call of Cthulhu.' Stays true to the original story and is wondrously executed as a silent film. The main thing that wasn't authentic, was that nothing was shown for long enough. A real silent film would show everything good and long. So, that's not a complaint, the editing on this film was smooth, snappy, and suspenseful. The climax scene especially was fantastic. I love that we don't really get to see Cthulhu quite clearly, as it should be. The best thing was the wonderful, haunting score. Loved it!",1488412800,3,549,4.851063829787234
8091133,5,B000BQTC98,"As many others have pointed out, this little gem of a film is an outstanding adaptation of Lovecraft's classic story, and highly enjoyable. Even though it is clearly a low-budget production, the devotion to both the story and the creation of late silent-era style and atmosphere is impeccable. Highly recommended!

Ps. Since another reviewer mentioned loving the film's musical score, I'll just add that the soundtrack album is available on CD and as an MP3 download from the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society website and is an additional treat for fans of the film.",1487808000,,566,5.086021505376344
8091134,5,B000BQTC98,"I've watched this film a couple of times. Shot as if it had been made in the era of publication, 1926, black and white, silent film. Very good production, really enjoyed it. Also, the special feature with background on the making of the film is well worth watching.",1486339200,,265,4.541666666666667
8091135,3,B000BQTC98,It got here pretty fast but the dvd case has been cracked because of handling I assume. I have OCD with the conditions of my movies and books so this really disapointed me. Other than that I believe everything to be alright,1483574400,,223,4.333333333333333
