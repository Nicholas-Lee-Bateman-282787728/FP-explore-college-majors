8598297,1,B00DVH4AAK,"I bought this as a gift for my husband and he could not wait to watch it!  Unfortunately, the disc doesn't play in any of our blu-ray dvd players. ""All Region"" apparently does not include the United States.",1391385600,2,206,4.421052631578948
8598298,3,B00DVH4AAK,"CD is great!!!  But I returned the DVD because it would not play on my dvd blu-ray player (United States), even though it said it was compatible for all regions.  Updated everything they say to do before I returned it.  The blu-ray dvd I received after returning the original had the same result.....obvious it will not play on my system, but I refuse to return it since I am sure it will eventually play on a newer rendition of my DVD player once it goes out of print.  My system is fairly new (less than 2 years old), so was surprised it would not play.  Someday I will have a big smile on my face and be able to bob my head rockin' style.  Keepin' the faith!!!  Any suggestions??????",1385251200,2,686,4.271317829457364
8598299,5,B00DVH4AAK,"For anyone who still yearns for the 70's Quo,or for any Quo fan who's just not old enough to know what they were like live back then, this is a must buy for you. Earlier in 2013 the original Status Quo memberss Francis Rossi, Rick Parfitt, Alan Lancaster and John Coghlan, commonly known as 'The Frantic Four', reformed to do a British reunion tour. This is the full Wembley concert from that reunion tour. There is also a back stage documentary, fan interviews and the Blu-ray edition also includes all 9 reunion shows in mp3 format. All songs featured are from 1970 - 1976. This really is the original Status Quo just as they used to be live back in the early - mid 70's, loud and hard rocking. For all American Quo fans who rarely got the chance to see them live this is a must buy. the show also features Bob Young on Harmonica, just like the old days.",1379548800,10,856,4.3229813664596275
