8487108,5,B005USB1VY,"Marvellously staged, sung and played, this wholly deserves at least a try, a fine sample of italian baroque opera at its best and that should definitively erase the belief that there's little more in Vivaldi than his concerti (pace Stravinsky). After watching this video and listening to this gorgeous opera, you ought to proceed towards investigating other similar works or Vivaldi's significant religious music output.",1455580800,,420,5.476923076923077
8487109,5,B005USB1VY,"Absolutely fantastic. A must for all Opera lovers and a masterpiece of Vivaldi. Spinosi is a miracle, and the perdormers are all wonderful. Don't miss it",1391126400,,153,4.923076923076923
8487110,5,B005USB1VY,"VERY HAPPY WITH THE DVD. IT WAS DELIVERED QUICKLY, AND IN A SECURE PACKAGE. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ARE ASKING FOR MY REVIEW AS i HAD REVIEWED IT AT YOUR REQUEST BEFORE.",1357344000,,166,4.0606060606060606
8487111,4,B005USB1VY,"I write this with a heavy heart. The work really deserves five stars. The opera is one of the best Baroque operas, the singing is superb, the acting is powerful and convincing, and the musicianship is immaculate. However, unfortunately, the staging is gloomy and really boring, and the costumes are the worst aspect of this production. I was particularly offended by Marie-Nicole Lemieux's 'look', this wonderful contralto who really deserves to be lauded for her polished performance in this production looked ridiculous in the way she was presented.",1340323200,9,551,5.2727272727272725
8487112,4,B005USB1VY,"Musical performance is really good. All musicians involved in this production are in the true ""baroque mode"": acrobatic, extravagant, florid and virtuosic. Jean-Christophe Spinosi, a regular contributor to Naive's Vivaldi Edition, leads Ensemble Matheus & Choeur du Th&eacute;tre des Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es in a spirited performance. The (soloist) singers are always musical and dramatically engaged, even though not all of them are on the same highest plane. Philippe Jaroussky (Ruggiero) is expectedly very fine, but he is slightly less than his splendid top form. Ver&oacute;nica Cangemi's Angelica is dramatically engaging, but her tone production can be less than perfectly even or smooth. The crown jewels of this production are, in my opinion, Jennifer Larmore's Alcina and Marie-Nicole Lemieux's Orlando. Their knock-out performance is absolutely ravishing! In fact, their arias and duets got numerous encores/replays when I first watched this DVD. On the whole, the soloist team is (almost) as good as one could wish for.

As for the stage production, this is Pierre Audi's boldest opera production known to me. As the story progresses, the dramaturgy slowly fades into the mists of symbolism, and by the end of Act III, the narrative structure is dissolved into disjunct, avant-garde style of experimental theater.(*1) It is never less than interesting, but instead of serving music it perhaps draws too much attention to itself. The sets and designs are beautiful, but the costumes can be a little bit overbearing. For example, Lemieux's ""beards"" makes her look more like Baba the Turk (in Igor Stravinsky's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rake-s-Progress/dp/B002GBQUSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rake's Progress</a>) than the Mad Orlando.

The worst aspect of this DVD is the sound. Only one single sound track encoded in the heavily compressed Dolby Digital format is provided. Perhaps, Naive is trying to save a few Euros by cramming 190 minutes of video and audio into a single (dual-layer) DVD-9 disc. The detrimental result is unacceptably poor flat sound. Forget the ""home theater experience"". Think of youtube sound instead. It is perplexing that a label (Naive) purporting to promote Antonio Vivaldi's music (think of Vivaldi Edition) could have made such a poor decision.

There are only 4 DVD sets of Vivaldi's operas currently available and two of them are of Orlando Furioso, arguably Vivaldi's most famous opera.(*2)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-San-Francisco-Opera-production/dp/6305701318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The San Francisco Opera production</a>&nbsp;has Marilyn Horne's splendid Orlando, but it is otherwise quite-dated and heavily cut. Worse, it is out of print for some years, so this Naive production is really the only choice.

Here is a suggestion to Naive: Please reissue this performance in 2-DVD format with (at least) LPCM and DTS 5.1 dual sound tracks and higher resolution video. Or better still, reissue it in the blu-ray format with a 5-channel uncompressed sound track.

5-star musicianship and 4-star staging in 1-star sound. Recommended with reservations.
