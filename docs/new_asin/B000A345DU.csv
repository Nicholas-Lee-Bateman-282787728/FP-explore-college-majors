2355424,5,B000A345DU,"This was everything I was hoping it to be, which is an anointed video to experience the presence of God. This is one of those videos that you can play to help you tap into God's glory. It's just as good as his CD. It showed me the parts that I wanted to see where the music would fade out on the CD to experience the event. It even showed me the part where the power went out and came back on during the time Bishop Eddie Long was speaking and showing them praising God for the victory. Good thing they had a back-up generator and the power didn't go out while William was singing.",1133481600,8,581,4.060869565217391

8073821,3,B000A345DU,"Beautiful music for the soul.  William Murphy and the singers give the listener polished, beautiful music.  There was too much talking in between building up to what was about to happen.  Overall a good DVD to listen to uplift the spirit and soul.",1422403200,,247,4.6976744186046515

8073823,5,B000A345DU,The DVD was recorded live and truly ministered to people's spirits and souls.  It is incredible that God can use even a recording to meet us right were we are.  Witnessing the vocal fundamentals was thoroughly impressive.,1353024000,,221,4.945945945945946
8073824,5,B000A345DU,Worshipping runs in his blood and must be in his DNA. William is a great worshipper and obviously this anointed singer got his gift from God. It is obvious it's in his blood: his dad and grand dad sings the same way,1314057600,,215,4.142857142857143
8073825,5,B000A345DU,"I've heard William Murphy sing many of times at the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship, but to experience him this way was anointed and a blessing. I love his singing, but something he said just made me holla (I'm not going to tell you. You just have to get it to find out). It's worth the money.",1173916800,,299,4.2631578947368425
8073826,5,B000A345DU,"This is an absolutely fantastic video. I watch/listen to it over and over again. My favorite song is ""Created to Worship."" What a testamony!!",1168300800,2,141,4.916666666666667
8073827,5,B000A345DU,"I bought this DVD and cd, and I can not stop watching it. Every time it plays I am constantly reminded of how precious the presence of God really is. I recommend this product as well as his cd to anyone who is really trying to get into the manifested presence of God, just for who He is and not for what he can do. It is obvious that Mr. Murphy truly loves God with all his heart, mind, soul, and body, and there is no doubt in my mind that God IS pleased with his worship! God Bless",1139961600,5,483,3.888888888888889
