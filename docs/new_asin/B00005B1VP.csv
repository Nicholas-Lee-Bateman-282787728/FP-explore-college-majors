1420607,5,B00005B1VP,"I loved this movie.  Both characters were played exceptionally well.  You could truly feel the chemistry between them (it was very sensual, very real)  and the story was well written.  The park and garden scenes were visually rich and shot beautifully.  The tension between the two races/religions was strongly felt and quite riveting.  I especially enjoyed the string over beats in the score as well as Tariq's performances with his band.  I hope to see him in more movies.  Props to the director as well.  Slam was a wonderfully made film as well.  Peace. CLB.",1007856000,,562,4.821052631578947
1420608,2,B00005B1VP,"This movie, at first glance, seemed promising. A sort of Romeo & Juliet thing with a Crown Heights spin on it- but it falls far short of its mark.
The protagonist is 1st generation American Rastafarian, and ends up romancing a Hasidic girl, informally engaged.
I'd give the story a 2 or 3 if it ended there. But the story, overly simplistic to begin with, was compounded by the negative stereotypes scattered throughout the movie. Clearly, the director, Marc Levin, has had no contact with Hasidism. Or if he has, he has had only negative interactions. We are not shown a single sympathetic figure in the entire Hasidic enclave, except for maybe the grandmother, who dies -coincidentally, the night that the girl and boy have pre-martial sex- a BIG Hasidic no-no.
The Hasidism are portrayed as pushy thugs, who stop at nothing to get what they want, be it sex, marriage, or revenge.
The other side is just as oversimplified. We are shown several Bob Marley caricatures- old men in dredlocks hanging out in the back of their stores, smoking marijuana and spouting hippy-istic nothings- but nothing of real substance.
The narration is absurd- someone rapping about what we've just seen and making fake rap sounds with his mouth as an interlude.
The ending is nonexistant- the boy is rapping his ""masterpiece"" about Brooklyn Babylon- hence the title- and we see a bunch of clips throughout the movie of him and the girl. The final shot is the girl pusing a bi-racial baby in a stroller. No resolution at all, when in real life there would have been so many more issues to it!
The different families' reactions to the relatioship, for one:
Will Sol (the black boy) convert? Is Sara (the jewish girl) going to leave her community? Nothing. We don't even know if they get married.
Very dissapointing.
Hasidism have to suffer so many slings and arrows of indignity in films- either they are nonexistant backdrops, or warped caricatures- see ""A Price Above Rubies"" if you don't believe me.
You'd think a Jewish director would have at least ATTEMPTED to get it right.
I give this film half a star for some interesting background on Rastafarianism and 1 star for portraying a black protagonist as  intelligent- possibly this film's only saving grace.",1007856000,,2240,4.833333333333333
1420609,4,B00005B1VP,"For being a low budget movie this was pretty decent compared to the movies contributed by Snoop,Master P,DMX and Fat Joe.(Mostly all weak).Black Thought really held his own. If your into good rap themed movies then this is one to get. It deals with prejudice between black and jewish people with love and a baby resulting from the lead characters. Very good!!!!",1007769600,,361,4.838709677419355
1420610,4,B00005B1VP,"First off- I gotta say that Mark Levin is the man!! He is well on his way to developing a film language that speaks to the depth and beauty of hip hop culture.  Like ""Slam"", this flick is structurally adventurous and beautifuly acted. Cats in Hollywod betta watch out- Tariq Trotter (aka Black Thought) is not only a dope MC- he's also got madd thesbian chops! Karen Goberman gives a beautifully subtle performance- and Bonz...well Bonz is pure charisma.
The film's strenght lies in the chemistry between the two leads. Most flicks depict interracial relationships as either silly and shallow (Jungle Fever) or corny and sentimental (Save the Last Dance).  Trotter and Goberman build a smoldering yet subtle connection that helps this flick rise above the usual ""Can't we all just get along"" propoganda.
Spend dat money!",994723200,2,820,4.978102189781022
1420611,4,B00005B1VP,"I find it shocking that almost everyone saw this as a retread of the Romeo & Juliet or West Side Story kind of forbidden love tale when the device the plot actually hinges on is the Biblical Song Of Solomon and the Ethiopian legend of Solomon & Sheba.  The story and plot follow the story told in the Song Of Solomon much more than they do Romeo & Juliet.  As a Jewish man, who happens to be a hip-hop artist, that is married to a Jamaican Rastafarian Brooklynite woman, maybe I found this story just way too irresistable.
No Brooklyn Babylon isn't a cinematic classic, but it beats almost everything else geared towards the young urban demographic with it's intelligence & relatability.",994118400,5,687,4.622950819672131
1420612,4,B00005B1VP,"Excellent music, excellent performances by the roots and even Spragga Benz, I'd like to get the soundtrack if its available.  The story bases itself loosely around the Song of Solomon, and lets you know of how the rastas see themselves as descendant of Solomon (jewish king) and Sheba.  The garden scene and others all mirror that earliest and greatest of love poems, and that's where the narrator gets his stuff from.  I thought the movie was better than most people did, maybe a little cliche, but well acted, not overacted, and just good to watch, good brooklyn scenes. Even the cameos are well done (slick rick).",993427200,4,616,4.7924528301886795
1420613,3,B00005B1VP,"So here we got another interracial Romeo and Juliet story.  The most distinctive thing about it is that it features acting and a soundtrack by the great hip hop band The Roots.  Tariq ""Black Thought"" Trotter delivers a charismatic performance... of course he's a charismatic MC playing a charismatic MC so it can't be too much of a stretch for him.  Karen Goberman is his attractive and likeable love interest, and the two generate a little chemistry... but they are not helped by the script.  The racial tension here isn't tangible.  It basically is retreading territory that ""Do the Right Thing"" covered much better, the only difference being that the Italians are replaced by Jews.  In DtRT the tension boiled off the screen.  Here it feels forced, even though these tensions are very real.  Of course fans of the Roots will enjoy the soundtrack and the performances by the band, which are by far the best thing about the film.  This would be a two star film without them.",993254400,,975,4.72189349112426
1420614,4,B00005B1VP,"Alright, this film is plain horrible.  While I admit that this isn't the most original telling of the most original story, there's much more to it than that.  To whoever had a problem with the ""racism"" in this film, the importance of Rastafarian ideals is obviously paramount to the movie, and failure to recognize this can lead to failure to understand it.  The narration of the movie is one of the coolest things I have ever heard.  Rahzel, the Godfather of Noyze, showcases his vocal talents in this narration, and it is very artfully done.  Just as Black Thought and Rahzel fit together in the Roots, they fit in this movie.  Perhaps one needs to understand the offbeat nature of Roots art to get the film.  All in all, the story is well acted and the fusion of the Roots into the movie is one of the coolest things I've ever seen.  I hope the Roots do this more.",992304000,,867,4.408805031446541
1420615,3,B00005B1VP,"I have to disagree with the first reviewer.
This film is easy going, mellow and uncomplicated. In other words, it's realistic in its simplicity.
Sure, the Romeo and Juliet storyline has been done many times before, and ""Brooklyn Babylon"" isn't some grand retelling of R & J.
And that's why it's strong.
Unlike ""Romeo + Juliet"" and ""Romeo Must Die"" this film doesn't rely on flair, flash and occasional overacting to drive the story.
The relationship between the two leads is believable and yes, while at first, it's the differences between them that attracts them to each other, when you break it down, they love each other DESPITE those differences.
And they do make a good couple on screen. The pairing of Tariq Trotter and Karen Goberman is much more believable than that of DiCaprio-Danes and Jet Li-Aaliyah in their respective movies.
At first, I thought the ending was too abrupt, but after I let the film sink in, I grew to appreciate its symbolism.
At the very least, if you're a Romeo and Juliet fan, rent this movie. Approach the film with an open-mind, not with that of a professional critic or with the mindset of someone looking for the meaning of life and the question of why we are here.
It does have insight if you allow it to show you that.",991267200,4,1257,4.616071428571429
1420616,1,B00005B1VP,"this film is just horrible:
1. although this movie is nominally concerned with the evils of racism, it uses some really ugly racial sterotypes.  the west indian day parade is depicted at a mindless orgy of primitives in strange costumes.  in fact, there's an important spiritual side to carribean festivals, which this film totally ignores.  the black folks are shown to be just a bunch of weed-smoking, irrational fools. consider the bizare advice sol's ""father figure"" gives him, and note the sceen where one brother procures some explosives -- and from whom?  an arab.  there's also the standard ""big momma"" character with a fake sounding west indian ""you mus get an educaaashun""-type accent thrown in.
2. the film is narrated in a very way.  not only are his vocal effects overdone, but the narrator breaks in to explain what's going on at times when doing so is unnecessary.  there's never a need to have a narrator do a recap; the story itself should be clear.
3.  the two main characters don't work well together.  there's no sense that these two people would ever like each other, much less fall in love.  the only thing it could be is the attraction of ""the other"" which was emphasized in mississippi masala, but either ignored here or handled in a trite -- ""can i touch your hair"" -- and offensive way.
4.  brooklyn babylon just doesn't add anything to the genre.  from ""west side story"" to ""china girl"" to ""romeo must die"" we've seen r&j material explored from a variety of stupid angles. why add another film to this mess?  what was the director's new vision?  other than changing the racial/gender dynamics slightly, there's no difference between this and any other r&j clone.
okay, the sound track is great. and, at times, the two main characters demonstrate some acting talent.  So there are a few good spots, but there's not nearly enough to go around.",989280000,3,1868,4.75776397515528
1420656,5,B00005B1VP,I love the roots as a rap group and now to see them in this movie is great. I date outside my race so I could relate to this movie very easily. I highly recommend this movie if your in a relationship outside of your race very positive outcome.,1355875200,,243,3.979591836734694
1420657,4,B00005B1VP,"The DVD came on time but the plastic film was ripped. that wasn't good, cause it was a Birthday present.",1261353600,,104,4.25
1420658,5,B00005B1VP,I saw this movie on BET before and I liked it so much that i wanted to see the unedited version.  I thought it was really good and i even gave it to my jewish boyfriend to watch.,1192147200,,178,3.6842105263157894
1420659,3,B00005B1VP,"When I ordered this movie I thought it was going to be about the Crown Heights riots of the early 1990's but it turned out to just be a story about two young people from Crown Heights from diff't sides of the street who want to break the racial barriers so that they can be together. As a movie depicting life in Brooklyn, I can't say how much it really makes you feel like you're there, the shots of the city are great and the film makers really captures the feeling of the small scale neighbourhoods of the city that one isn't really familar with unless they've lived there and you can associate the image the a hot afternoon sunset and flock of pigeons with the sound of squeaking brakes and the smell of dinner cooking. I was dissapppointed that overall the story seemed to lean in a direction which darkened the image of the Jewish people. Although, both groups in this movie are depicted as enemy to give you the sense of resistance that both characters are dealing with as a couple, by the end the story it seemed to me as if they were illustrating the Jewish community more as the bad guy and just racially unjust. It's not a bad movie and I get inthe mood to watch it once in a while  only because of the scenery, but it really wasn't what I though I was getting. The main characters spend most of the movie just walking around the neighbourhood and somehow always running into eachother which is silly, not to mention the girl just took on this persona of being a cute lil bimbo that made me feel like it was a movie made by a guy for a guy, especially in the scene where they are ""together"".",1191715200,,1602,4.287128712871287
1420660,4,B00005B1VP,"Okay, I have to admit, I bought the DVD only because Black Thought was on the cover. Being the huge Roots fan that I am, I felt obligated to give it a viewing. I was not greatly impressed with the script until I considered the source, Bonz Malone (he plays Scratch in the film.) The original script was only 10 or so pages long, meaning that a lot of the dialogue is improvised and it feels that way. Tariq does hold his own as does the female lead, to me, the ""supporting"" cast is where the film folds up shop. This is a great film that can be used in an educational setting perhaps in a Social Studies class. Reason being because it focusing in on tolerance and helps to bring to light some of the parallels that the two waring fractions have in common. This is best demonstrated during the dinner scene at Sara's house. At any rate, I guess I have to justify my rating of four stars. Two stars because of the soundtrack alone, which by the way is not available (what a pity). The other two stars are earned because of what it is trying to convey; despite the differences that society has being focused on for eons, we still have more things in common, one of which is the ability to love.

Just give it a viewing if you know someone who owns the movie and make your own decision. That is my two cents worth.",1101081600,7,1310,4.219123505976095

1420662,5,B00005B1VP,This is the best hood love story i have seen. Black Thought and the rest of The Roots had a great performance. Black with his love for a jewish girl and hate for the rest of the jews. He lets his heart decide and not his mind or boys. Him and his crew are the best in the music business.if you like this movie I recommend you to get all their cds. Peace.,1021852800,,354,3.863013698630137
1420663,3,B00005B1VP,"This is an independent film about forbidden love and the ensuing violent cultural clashes between Brooklyn's African-American and Jewish Communities. The storyline is somewhat predictable, but the film's musical score, detailed cinematography, and suprisingly decent acting make it a worthwhile watch. The chemistry between the main characters Sol (Tariq Trotter) and Sara (Karen Goberman), was not entirely believable, and the acting by the secondary actors could have used some touching up. Allusions to Ancient Babylon and King Solomon's Empire put an interesting twist on the story. You will see visually spectacular footage of Brooklyn's Carribean Festival (a kind of Mardi Gras celebration). If you've never seen or heard the Roots perform, you are in for a treat. They present an evocative style of Hip-Hop, without relying on those played out themes (i.e. money, sex, violence). The sound they create is truly organic and full of musical integrity. Yes, we've seen forbidden love stories before, but none quite like this.",1014422400,10,1029,5.477987421383648
1420664,4,B00005B1VP,"This movie was an excellent display of the Rastafarian backround and the Jewish backround.  Both of the characters did an excellent job and also the supporting cast too.  It was very, real, modern, and entertaining.  The music was superb and displayed a great mixture of both worlds.  If you haven't seen this movie, go see it.
