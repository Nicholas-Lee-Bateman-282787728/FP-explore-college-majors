1684262,5,B000062VXE,"This DVD is a discussion of BB King's technique with the King himself talking and demonstrating on the guitar throughout. There are more licks here than you can shake a stick at, and BB makes every effort to make sure that the viewer understands what is being played. This is no mere interview, and the DVD accurately demonstrates and teaches BB King's guitar style.

The DVD is a superb learning tool, but there is no tab, so you will need to use the repeat feature of the DVD player and watch and listen attentively. I don't think a moderately skilled guitarist would have any difficulty figuring out what is being played, but this is not aimed at the beginner. There is no presentation of scales or playing positions, so you should regard this knowledge as a pre-requisite.

The DVD is a collection of 3 VHS tapes, with added features. Frankly, none of the added features, except for the Live Band Performance and tuning, add to the quality of the package, and the DVD would have been better without them. What makes this DVD so attractive is BB King demonstrating his guitar technique and his approach to improvisation. I enjoy this DVD immensely, and I expect to be viewing and learning for years to come.",1240272000,3,1210,4.649532710280374
1684263,1,B000062VXE,"There's no TAB book with this DVD.
The camera angles are not good enough to see what BB is playing.
This is not a Instructional DVD.
It's just an interview with BB playing a few licks.
Don't waste your money.",1218153600,5,208,4.225
1684264,5,B000062VXE,"This DVD is a compilation of several VHS tapes which were made in the 1990s. The DVD is quite pricey and I, mistakenly, first bought ""Highlights"". I originally thought they were different items, the information on the DVD did not include a track list. This DVD ""Blues Master"" is the complete version and ""Highlights"" is the scaled down version of this set. However, I am more than happy with this product. B.B.'s performance is easily his best live work in the last 20 years and the sound is excellent. This is much better than say ""By Request"" or ""Jazz Channel Presents"". If you are a guitar player you will get hints from it, but its not a real instructional lesson ( I agree with the previous reviewer in that regard), it's more like an interview and overview of Mr King's career. If you want instruction, buy one of the many books available or the new Guitar Signature Licks DVD.

I feel as a historical record of Blues material the performance section of this DVD(which you can play alone)is more than worth the price. BB plays with the band he has worked with since the late 1980s. These days when the Blues Originals are leaving us yearly, this is a great record of B.B. at the end of his career. He even stands up and plays ""Everyday I Have The Blues"", something I haven't seen since the early 90s. Other highlights are ""Three O'Clock Blues"", his first hit, ""You Upset Me Baby"" the lead off tune and his sexist ""Paying The Cost To Be the Boss"", a superb Jump Blues. If you like B.B. get this DVD for the historical value and great performance presentation. If you want to play like him get lessons (if you can really learn the Blues).",1113436800,16,1642,4.473333333333334
1684265,1,B000062VXE,"BB's performance's are ok; but you will find better somewhere else. As fas as this being an instructional DVD - it is awful; probably doesn't get any worse. I have never EVER felt compelled to write a review of anything until I bought this. If you haven't figured it out yet, do NOT buy it.",1112659200,7,290,4.290909090909091
1684266,5,B000062VXE,"This has some of the most valuable and comprehensive blues video instruction material you'll find anywhere.  It's an absolute treasure trove  of blues guitar knowledge and chops. There's something for everyone:  beginner, intermediate, advanced, pro.
But it goes way beyond that: A  real bonus is that the set includes a number of  B.B-with-full-band-in-studio performances.  Anybody (player or not) who  loves the blues and B.B. King should own this set.
The set does not  include printed (or displayed) music or tablature, a disadvantage for those  in the early stages of developing their ability to learn by watching and  listening. My advice to beginners (and non-beginners too!): Stay with this  stuff and your time and concentration will be well rewarded.
If you're  one of the many players who have become adept at learning by ear, I'd say  use this as a supplement to (but not replacement for) learning from his  audio recordings.
There is interesting coverage of the mechanics of  B.B's sound, including first-finger string bends (ouch) and getting that  famous vibrato.
Some of the most valuable material (for me) is where the  discussion gets inside B.B.'s head, where he describes what he is thinking  as he builds a solo, his approach to entertainment and the audience, how he  approaches building on a previous solo, and using a playing style to take  the band and the music in a certain direction.",967852800,11,1412,5.08296943231441

1684273,3,B000062VXE,"Great to see the old master talking about his life and influences - but the whole thing is a little short on teaching content. Nice way to fill a few hours of watching and listening [and, of course you may well pick up some useful tips along the way], but don't expect to learn a lot of specific playing techniques.",1399939200,,315,4.266666666666667
1684274,5,B000062VXE,"If you love B. B. King like I do, this is a rare opportunity to hear him explain in his own words, his techniques, his ""heroes"" as a young guitar player, how he approaches blues solos, and much more.  Like any artist who's been working at their craft for a lifetime, it's hard for him to put into words a lot of what he's learned over the years, but boy, it's great fun to hear him try.  This DVD may not make you a better guitar player, (it's not really a ""how-to"" session) but anytime you can spend a couple hours listening to a master talk about their art, you can't help but learn and grow. Imagine if someone had filmed a couple hours of Robert Johnson showing us his licks and explaining who he learned from. This feels a little like that.",1375488000,2,745,4.2027972027972025
1684275,5,B000062VXE,"This recording sticks out from all the blues tuturials and lessons I know because here you have one of the most influential blues guitarists of all times as your teacher. Admittedly, this DVD is not for beginners but for intermediate and advanced guitarists because there are no tabs. This should have been printed on the DVD's cover. But this is its only downside. For me, seeing B.B. play his solos in close-up has taught me a lot. 10 stars for this DVD!",1348963200,3,456,4.573170731707317
1684276,5,B000062VXE,Essential for anyone who wants to really understand his style. I lost my first copy and am buying it again. If I find the old DVD I have a gift for someone.,1281571200,,156,3.90625
7957686,4,B000062VXE,This is a very engaging and helpful instructional detailed DVD to learn BB Kings lines Id also suggest getting some of his earliest recording switch can help and also getting the Imperial recordings by T-bone Walker this will help a lot too and just sitting with it and being patient and make sure that you have the phrasing down and then get the timing down but this is totally worth it are used to have this on VHS totally worth it,1525046400,,433,4.3580246913580245

I have had the privilege of seeing bb at least 10 times. the best being with albert &bobby blue bland.saw him the last time he played the venetian room.got to meet the man hisself.he asked my wife and I to stay for the second show even bought us a bottle of wine. the point being two crackers gave more of a crap about bb than all you all. and this dvd sucks!!!!!,1489276800,,439,4.116279069767442

7957693,5,B000062VXE,"Who are the people who gave this less than five stars?

This is the best B.B. King video I've ever seen. It's not a performance video, so if you were expecting a concert and gave this one star, you need to be slapped. It's a video of King talking about how to play blues guitar.

In this video, he tells you everything. His influences. How to do his vibrato. The gauges of his strings. The thickness of his pick. The kind of amp he uses. How he sets the amp. What he has studied. How he practices. You name it; it's in here.

This video can take years off of your aimless wandering. You won't have to rely on bad Internet guesswork when you want to find out how B.B. did it. You'll know, because the man himself told you.",1455667200,4,721,4.135714285714286
7957694,5,B000062VXE,"In interview format B.B. King gives a Master's Class, not only on Blues but on guitar in general. I had the unbelievable pleasure of seeing him live. One thing that stands out is his restraint and commitment to only delivering his very best. 'Speaking clearly', as he says. His depth of knowledge and proficiency in other styles is impressive. This DVD is a fountainhead of great ideas and techniques, you will come back to over and over. Any serious Blues guitarist needs this in their library.",1453507200,2,495,4.767441860465116
