8262337,5,B0016GOO72,"This is a great movie. It is not full of action scenes which most people need in order to sit in front of a screen for an hour or two. If you can appreciate the life of hari-bhajan, this movie shows transcendental experience. It is good evidence that there is more than what meets the eye in this realm of three dimensions and six sense experience. And it is a true story and Hema Malini acts the part of Meera very well.",1436572800,,421,4.146341463414634

8262340,5,B0016GOO72,"'Meera' has a lot to offer for an audience interested in the royal families of Rajasthan, India. Set in the 1500s A D, the story gives out blatant glimpses of the conflicts in all levels between the Rajputs, as well as Rajputs and the Mughals. While the story may not be historically accurate, it still goes deep into the royal way of life.

Meera is known for her devotional songs. She is considered a saint by the people of Rajasthan. Hema Malini has portrayed Meera perfectly. The photography is spectacular, the music is divine, and Hema's beauty is exquisite. The best aspect of this movie is its music, with unbelievably talented singers. They have justified Meera and her bhajans (devotional music). Vani Jayaram's voice is truly divine.",1255478400,5,744,4.858267716535433
