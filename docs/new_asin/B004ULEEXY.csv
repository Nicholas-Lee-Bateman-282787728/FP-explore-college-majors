4467386,3,B004ULEEXY,"Sebastian Gutierrez's ELEKTRA LUXX doesn't quite know what it wants to be.  It's a comedy, there's no doubt--there are some absolutely hilarious moments.  It's also an inspirational piece, and a character study, and a romance, and a study of aging and womanhood.  In these latter areas, it stumbles a bit, never reaching its full stride.

The film revolves around retired porn star Elektra Luxx (Carla Gugino).  She's pregnant now and teaching a sex class for housewives, living a relatively quiet life.  One day, a woman (Marley Shelton) approaches her with a proposition: cheat with her boyfriend.  Shenanigans ensue, and Elektra slowly finds her place in life.  The film is framed/narrated/hosted by a porn blogger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).

The cast is solid.  Carla Gugino is phenomenal, carrying the entire weight of the film on her shoulders.  Gordon-Levitt is hilarious, as is Timothy Olyphant as perhaps the one guy whom Elektra can love.  Olyphant and Gugino's scenes are the funniest in the film; too bad he's only in it for the blink of an eye.  The supporting roles are also solid (a grossly underused Kathleen Quinnan being the standout), and there is a funny/creepy/thoughtful cameo from an uncredited great actress (no spoilers).  Perhaps the most surprising thing is that the film manages to be sexy without being at all exploitative; a true wonder these days.  On the other hand, the script is a bit haphazard; there are too many subplots that meander too far from Elektra's story.  And Gordon-Levitt's character is inconsequential; the actor himself is hilarious, but his ""skits"" (for that's what they amount to) add nothing to the story as a whole.  The overall effect is a film that tries to do too much.  It's still absolutely funny in spots (again, kudos to Olyphant), and gives Gugino a chance to prove just how good she is.  But as a whole, ELEKTRA LUXX feels more like a collection of ""parts"" that never truly congeal.",1308614400,12,1942,4.975155279503106
4467387,4,B004ULEEXY,"""What kind of person are you?""  Retiring pregnant porn star Elektra Luxx (Gugino) fills her days by teaching a sexology class.  After being approached by a stranger with a tie to her dead ex-boyfriend her day starts to get weird.  If you have seen the previews to this then you think you know what the movie is about. You would be wrong.  From what I saw I expected a very funny comedy.  While this movie does have it's funny moments, at its core it actually a very moving story.  A woman who is trying to figure out where her life is is the one everyone seems to go to for advice, help or anything she can provide.  Being that the movie is about a porn star there are a few pretty raunchy scenes and dialogue, but no where near what you would have expected.  There is a shot a a male and female butt and that is the extent of the nudity.  The acting and characters are very entertaining that it makes you want to watch and see everyone get what they want.  This is not at all what I expected, it was better.  Overall a very touching, and somewhat funny story about finding out and being comfortable with who you are.  I give it a B+.

Would I watch it again? - I think I actually would.

4467412,4,B004ULEEXY,"This bawdy little film is waaaay to risque for general audiences but is audacious enough for some of you...you know who you are! It's about a semi-retired porn star, so there is very little left unsaid or undone.

  * Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Inception"" and ""The Lookout"") must have a GREAT agent! He has been in first-class projects since the beginning of his career. His character runs a blog devoted to the life and times of ""Elektra Luxx""; his attempts to film and broadcast from his mother's basement are interrupted by mundane tasks, like taking out the garbage.
  * Carla Gugino (she played this role before in ""Women in Trouble"" AND she shared the screen with Gordon-Levitt once before in ""The Lookout."") As our eponymous porn star, she sings, dances, and has an interesting scene where she plays against herself, as her tough twin serving time for a felony. The twin has a lisp and a distinctive personality. This is a great showcase for Ms. Gugino!
  * Kathleen Quinlan (""Made of Honor"") graduated years ago from teenybopper roles, e.g., ""American Grafitti."" Her character attends Ms. Luxx's adult education class: ""How to Act Like a Porn Star in Bed.""
  * Timothy Olyphant (""Deadwood"") was last heard as Clint Eastwood's voice in ""Rango."" He is hilarious in this one, and appealing as all get out! We're gonna see a LOT of this guy!
  * Adrianne Palicki (lots of TV) plays a dim bulb who is thinks maybe she should see a doctor because she might be ""artistic."" She admits she isn't ""the sharpest stool in the shed.""

This is by no means a list of the entire cast. Pretty much every actor has his or her moment to show off and the plot is all over the map, but funny 95% of the time. The Seattle International Film Festival audience laughed out loud all the way through.",1423785600,,1778,4.645367412140575

Has a lot of beautiful women in it and they are just barely dressed. Worth a look.",1350432000,4,355,4.313432835820896
4467423,4,B004ULEEXY,"A quirky little movie about a former porn star, Carla, trying to live a normal life while teaching a class at the learning annex.  Her day takes a weird twist.
Overall, I really enjoyed this flick.  Couple of spots where the flow died.  It got resuscitated each time.  Supporting cast was delight.  How their paths cross.  Who's doing what & why.  If it hadn't died those 2 spots, it would have been 5 stars.
I hate giving the synopsis of the movie when you can find it everywhere.  I don't like to give plot points away or how each actor/actress plays their roles.
All I can say is I hope you found this as enjoyable as I did.
Content, for a movie about a porn star, there is only 2 bare asses shown.  Deleted scene shows 2 more & some boobies.  Little bit of cussing.",1320624000,8,769,4.241379310344827

4467427,2,B004ULEEXY,"Some of the most beautiful and talented actresses in Hollywood are featured herein, the acting is good, but the screenplay drags it down.  ""EL"" can't seem to settle on a tone.  It tries to be a zany comedy (it's more amusing than funny), a drama, a satire (of porn movies?), a sexy romance,...it juggles all these in a somewhat unengaging, clumsy manner.  There are (too) many characters and many silly situations (events that would only happen in porn movies or cheesy sitcoms) that I guess are supposed to be seen as ""quirky.""  Much of the dialogue is stilted and lame, as in, real-people-don't-talk-this-way lame.  Carla Cugino's character does a ""Cabaret""-like song-and-dance bit that comes out of nowhere and while it's kinda cute-sexy, Carla G doesn't really sing well and it adds nothing to the movie overall.  It's worth seeing if you're a Gugino fan, but this is a mediocre movie, basically Pedro Almodovar Lite (and while I like some of his films, I think he's a tad overrated).  Watch an old Woody Allen movie instead (""Love and Death,"" ""Play It Again, Sam"").",1309392000,3,1070,4.846153846153846
