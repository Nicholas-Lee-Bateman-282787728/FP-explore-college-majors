8199810,2,B000RA3FF0,"Save your money.  It had some very basic info, but it tried to be more entertaining than anything.  I wish I had purchased a different DVD.",1347148800,,139,4.3076923076923075
8199811,3,B000RA3FF0,"I ordered this for my husband because we were so spent on all the mundane information we were getting about being pregnant and what to expect.  I thought this was a fun way for him to get the husbands information,  granted it was a little too goofy and cheesy but it had some good info that my husband hadn't thought of.  I gave it a three star because it was a little too cheesy and could have had more info in it.

This is great for a baby shower gift.  Both funny and helpful.",1341705600,,479,4.053191489361702
8199812,5,B000RA3FF0,"My husband really enjoyed this movie, and he did learn a lot from it.  It made him very aware of how variable my mood is likely to be as I'm in labor, rofl, in a serious yet amusing way.  And it made him more interested in my pregnancy.  I think ""What to Expect for Dads...""  was way to dry for him to even absorb much.  This movie isn't very long but it truly lets Dads know how important their role in the big day is going to be.",1322611200,,431,3.852272727272727
8199813,5,B000RA3FF0,"My husband and I watched this dvd yesterday (we rented it from Netflix). At first the silly dad game-show motif is a bit off-putting, but the doctors offer very good advice that my husband had not yet heard even after our 8 week childbirth class. Most childbirth dvds address the mother's point of view, this dvd is unique in that it is entirely focused on information that fathers need to know to be good coaches and informed fathers. The dads offer very practical advice from what to bring to the hospital to how to support your wife during labor. Actual doctors let parents know what to expect in the delivery room and how your baby will be handled by the hospital staff after birth. Good advice in easy-to-digest format. Highly informative and useful. Definitely recommended.",1246838400,2,779,4.777777777777778
