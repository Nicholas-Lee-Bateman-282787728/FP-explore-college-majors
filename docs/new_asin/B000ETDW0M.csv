8191767,5,B000ETDW0M,At first I thought it was silly but I tried it and lost more than 20 pounds in 3 months.  I watch the DVD once a week.  It's a bit like meditation.  I'm less hungry and eat about half what I used to eat and feel full.  This really works for me.,1152835200,,244,3.6346153846153846
8191768,1,B000ETDW0M,"This is the worst hypnosis tape I have ever heard.  It is a DVD with a ridiculous, jerky spiral thing and the repeated message ""eat half of what's on your plate"".  Not worth the money!",1151280000,3,184,4.228571428571429
