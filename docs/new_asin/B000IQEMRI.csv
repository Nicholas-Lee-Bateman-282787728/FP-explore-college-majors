2663072,3,B000IQEMRI,I was disappointed in the fact that half-way through the first cd the program was messed up and skipped and pixeled out. The second disc was fine and well as the beginning and the last part of the first disc.,1407369600,3,208,4.225
2663073,4,B000IQEMRI,This was added to the other Country Family Reunion DVD's that I already have.  They are always fun to watch.,1407196800,,108,4.4

2663077,5,B000IQEMRI,Bought this entire series 2 or 3 years ago.  Recently I discovered that one of my DVD's was broken.  Found this set on Amazon and purchased.  It worked perfectly and replaced the broken one.  Great buy.,1397692800,,202,4.527777777777778
2663078,5,B000IQEMRI,"If anybody likes country music they would certainly enjoy this. We already have many country reunion dvd's and love everyone of them.

2663079,5,B000IQEMRI,"These are the country singers and artists that I grew up listening to.  It brings back memories of watching country music shows with my grandparents.  I wish they were still around to share this with.  I enjoy their stories and music.  Reminds me of the old ""jam"" sessions musicians used to have in my part of the country.",1392076800,,322,4.5
2663080,5,B000IQEMRI,It is well done with many great artists and kids of famous artists. Love it and already have gotten hours of enjoyment,1390003200,,118,4.409090909090909

2663082,5,B000IQEMRI,"I've never written a review before, but this DVD was exceptional. I purchased it for my husband who loves classic country music.
He wanted to purchase a CD by Hawkshaw Hawkins, Jr. We couldn't find any CDs, but saw he would be a guest on this
reunion CD. It also features the children of Conway Twitty, Marty Robbins, Tammy Wynette and several others. They are
just sitting around with friends who worked with their parents, singing and telling stories. My husband was going to watch
""just a little bit,"" before going to bed, but ended up watching the whole thing. He watched it the next night too. I'm not a country
music fan, but I enjoyed it too.",1389225600,3,649,4.508474576271187

2663085,4,B000IQEMRI,"I'm hooked on the folksy chat and superb old-time country music on these reunion dvd's.  Since I was a kid when most of these stars were gaining Nashville fame, this is my opportunity to see and hear the stars perform the songs that made them famous. The Generations episode has the added interest of seeing the offspring of the stars.  Worth a look.",1386720000,,350,4.5396825396825395
2663086,5,B000IQEMRI,"highly enjoyable ,great to see some of those who have past now talking about there lives and singing together ,any country fan will enjoy this dvd",1386288000,,146,4.653846153846154
2663087,5,B000IQEMRI,"I bought Country Family Reunion, 1&2.  Without a doubt it is the best, the greatest, and beyond what I expected.  I stayed up half the night watching them even though I had to be up at 6 to go to work.  If you have any doubts, please clear them.  They are wonderful videos.  I only wish Amazon had the Looking Back series.  It is well worth any money spent on these dvds.  I hope to get all of them eventually.  There are some funny scenes, and also some touching scenes.  When you see Larry Black on the video, you will be surprised.  He still looks the same, but you can see the difference the years make.  And Bill Anderson never ages.  Just gets better.  I highly recommend that you try at least one of the DVDs.  You will be left wanting more.",1378771200,3,748,4.176056338028169
2663088,5,B000IQEMRI,"brilliant in every way  a must for any country music fan country legends Kitty Wells,  Bill Anderson ,Johnny Paycheck and Jean shepard I really enjoyed although all were brilliant",1376870400,,179,5.137931034482759
2663089,5,B000IQEMRI,"The songs & conversations presented on this DVD are just like being entertained by good friends. I felt in watching this that I fit right in with the very well known older styled country singers like Larry Gatlin & brothers, J.Ed Brown, Jean Sheppard, Katie Wells, Bill Anderson & etc. Their talents never cease &, yet, they seem like regular humble people like the rest of us.",1371945600,5,377,4.641791044776119
2663090,5,B000IQEMRI,"I love these true country singers and love the talking and sharing of stories, I enjoyed the singing but loved the stories best of all, You really got to know the person behind the songs.",1370822400,,187,4.371428571428571
2663091,5,B000IQEMRI,We watch the Country Family Reunion on RFD TV every Friday evening.  This DVD was along the same lines and was very enjoyable!,1370563200,,126,4.478260869565218
2663092,5,B000IQEMRI,This is one of my favorites and the quality is great. I will order more when they come out and will keep this one in my private collection of county Music Videos. Thanks for great service.,1369094400,,188,4.25
2663093,5,B000IQEMRI,"Truly  was enjoyed! Hope to find more to buy as there is a series of these. I watch the TV program & knew these were great to be in  a collection of mine. Prefer the earlier country singers than the present way in which is being presented by young country singers. How can one not like Jim Ed Brown, Larry Gatlin & brothers, Jean Sheppard, Roy Clark & etc even @ their advanced ages now. They are the best!",1369008000,,406,4.1265822784810124
2663094,1,B000IQEMRI,Bought this for my husband to watch and listen to on our home theater unit.  He was very diappointed that this was a bunch of people sitting around talking and occasionally breaking out into song.  Thought it was going to be more Grand ole opry style of performances.,1367366400,,267,4.541666666666667
2663095,5,B000IQEMRI,I bought this for a friend who just loves it she had been trying to order it for ages now,1367020800,,89,3.5
2663096,5,B000IQEMRI,Again the Country Family Reunion Celebration was again well worth what I paid for it. We watch it often and I think it was the last dvd of the original dvds of the beginning of the series to be recorded. I recommend this dvd to anyone who likes country music with comments from those who took part.,1366588800,7,298,4.245614035087719
2663097,5,B000IQEMRI,"Brought back many wonderful memories! I'll watch it over & over!
I can't do much anymore so this video brings me back to the days when I could dance & sing!
The price is reasonable!",1365033600,,181,4.2
2663098,4,B000IQEMRI,"Great DVD for providing a historical record of the old country and western performers and their music.  This style of music has been disappearing from the music scene for years.  If you go to Nashville today, it is hard to find traditional C&W music being performed.  Same thing in New Orleans with Dixieland Jazz.  C&W and Dixieland have been replaced with very loud rock and pop style music.",1362355200,,393,4.735294117647059
2663099,4,B000IQEMRI,The programs were great but we were disappointed that it was not  captioned.  Many elderly people have hearing problems and they are the ones who would most enjoy these videos.,1354752000,5,176,4.833333333333333
2663100,5,B000IQEMRI,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this video of the old-time great singers. I have purchased others as this is
only one of many that were made.",1352937600,2,139,4.6
2663101,5,B000IQEMRI,"An essential piece of Classic Country history and a must for country fans. Thank you Larry Black!

Country music fans owe a major debt to country music  (and, at one time, rock & roll) deejay and TV producer, Larry Black for this 2-DVD set as well as others he has produced and released through his Gabriel Communications Company. There's another review of the set here on Amazon but that just provides the musical contents. Sure there are 29 songs in this set but those take just over an hour. The two DVDs in this volume run almost FOUR hours! And it's what goes on between the music that - at least for me - was the real reason these DVDs are so important - as well as entertaining.

While this set has been available for over six years I just discovered it last month and have spent many hours immersed in the pleasures of it.

A bit a background: In 2005 the jovial Black (who now produces a cable TV show called ""Larry's Country Diner"" featuring country music guests), booked a Nashville TV studio for a few days and invited 27 country music legends to come, sit in the studio in chairs set up ""in the round"" to swap stories and sing songs they either wrote or made famous. Black kept the cameras rolling to catch every moment. The concept worked so well that he invited some of the folks back in subsequent years and added new ones. Sadly some died before they could return and these precious documents may well be the last recorded appearances of some of them. The ""host"" of this first show is country singer/songwriter Bill Anderson who, like nearly all the folks on the DVD, is a member of the Grand Ole Opry. But, after the first 30 minutes or so of ""facilitating"" by Anderson, the participants carry the ball the rest of the way. There are a few sections where Anderson asks for stories about Roger Miller (some of which had me laughing out loud - as it did those in the studio) and Roy Acuff. Dobro player Brother Oswald - who played with Acuff for 54 years! - tells some great stories and then performs Acuff's signature tune ""The Great Speckled Bird"". Del Reeves does a spot-on impersonation of Acuff . I forgot to mention that there is a five-piece band in the studio to accompany those performers who sing. Not all of the 27 legends are singers or musicians. Fred Foster produced Dolly Parton's first hit and is one of the storytellers not mentioned in the ""track list"" for this DVD.

In the four hours I learned how Roger Miller wrote ""King of the Road"", Heard Jack Greene perform the Dallas Frazier song ""There Goes My Everything"" (which won the first CMA award in 1967), heard Kitty Wells sing a gospel song, listened as Jeannie C. Riley tells about the night she ""slept with"" Johnny Paycheck and watching his reaction and listed to casual performances by Merle Kilgore, Little Jimmy Dickens Jean Shepard, and Johnny Russell (whose song ""Act Naturally"" was a hit for Ringo Starr.)

And this DVD is just the tip of the iceberg. There are more volumes in the series that I'm looking forward to. These videos are true historic documents and - unlike the ""Glad Ole Opry"" performance-only DVDs that I've reviewed, these videos will serve researchers of classic country music for years to come. A complete set belongs in every major music library. But they are so much fun (trust me the stories really are funny) that every country fan needs to know about these.

If I could give it six stars, I would!

By the way, I've had a chance to sample a similar series that Black - who shows up periodically in the volume under review - produced with rock and roll stars of the early 1960s, when - like Black - I was working a small rock and roll station. Stay tuned for my review of that set.

I hope you found this review both helpful and entertaining.

Something you will enjoy watching over and over for years to come. This is the dvd with the children of the great country stars that alot of us grew up listening to.
