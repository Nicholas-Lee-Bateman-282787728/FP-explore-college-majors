I have owned Horses for over forty years so loved these films even more, but if you think the Horse is a magnificent animal, then you will love these stories. Flimed in beautiful surroundings.

1660167,4,B00005T30M,"Two of my grandsons, ages 7 and 11, were enthralled.  I thought it was rather hokey, but remember reading and loving all the Farley books as a kid, so I could cut the movie some slack. Great scenery.  How the horse managed to survive on that island without a blade of grass or hay, not to mention fresh water (ditto the kid for the water) will forever remain a mystery.",1292112000,,369,4.257142857142857
1660168,5,B00005T30M,"For a number of years, The Black Stallion has always stuck in my mind as one of the most beautifully filmed movies that I could remember.  After the ship goes down and the boy and horse wind up on the island, a dance of fear and need occur between the two.  A tenuous, and, then, strong bond forms and continues in the ""real"" world.  The Black Stallion Returns is a continuation of the first film.  While the primary characters are in this second film, it's just my opinion that the first is much better, although, it's nice to know that this love continues over time and distance.",1264982400,,581,4.401869158878505
1660169,5,B00005T30M,"I originally only wanted The Black Stallion, but seeing these two together for a reasonable price was enough of a motivator to just buy both. They are wonderful, classic movies that I enjoyed as a child and now I enjoy them again with my daughter.",1263686400,,247,4.511111111111111
1660170,5,B00005T30M,"Great classics, good price. My daughter loves anything and everything to do with horses and you can imagine that she loves these movies. It's great to have been able to enjoy these films myself as a child and to now enjoy them with my children.",1138665600,2,244,4.444444444444445
1660171,5,B00005T30M,"The beauty of friendship and the power of love between a boy and a horse is shown in these adventure films where the gallant black horse and the sympathy of the boy make you love the films.

Besides the surrounding atmosphere and the other actors contribute to the making of these very charming films which can be seen with all the family.",1127606400,4,339,4.467741935483871
1660172,5,B00005T30M,"I have read every book that Walter and his son have written about the Black. The books always captured a child's point of view about horses. The dream of sailing off into the wind on the back of a really fast steed. I think Coppola captured that feeling in both of these movies. I like the quietness of the first one. The book was written to make you feel rather than listen to dialogue. There was little dialogue to begin with. Slightly off the subject, I think Walter had a passion about Seabisquit and had him in mind when he created the Black.
Kelly Reno was superb. A total natural around horses. Cass- ole was stunning, even in makeup. Oh, if the horse looks brown in the sunlight, remember this, no animal is truly black. They're all just a really dark shade of brown.",1038787200,9,775,4.388888888888889
1660173,5,B00005T30M,"The Black Stallion: An excellent story by Walter Farley which envokes all the emotions. After a shipwreck a young boy & a magnificent black Arabian stallion are stranded on an island where they become friends. Eventually they are rescued & meet a former race horse trainer, portrayed wonderfully by Mickey Rooney, who trains them both & enter them into a thrilling match race. The photography is superb. When Kelly Reno & the horse are together on the screen a magical presence fills the air & warms the heart.
The Black Stallion Returns: Begins with The Black being reclaimed by his true owners & taken back to the Sahara desert. Reno follows desperate to find & recover his horse. Breath taking scenery abounds as we follow Reno on his journey where he befriends a young man returning from school to partisipate in a horse race which determines the wealth or all the tribes in the desert. Reno must ride his Black to save him from being taken by the winner, his new friend must also win for the sake of his family & both are beseiged by the bad guys who want to win for the same reasons. A wealth of learning & experience is felt along the way & the movie comes to it's dramatic & tear jerking conclusion.
Both of these movies will be enjoyed over & over. I saw them in the theater 20 years ago (times flies) & have seem them often. Never have they lost their appeal or excitement.",988243200,5,1383,4.470355731225297
