I really got into the anime, when I bought them and almost watched the DVD's everyday. Fun fact, I met Masashi Kishimoto fact-to-face and spoke with him at the NYC comic con. I got his autograph and put it right next to the DVD's I got on here, since they are the first official Naruto items I ever bought/owned.",1493942400,,420,4.197530864197531
