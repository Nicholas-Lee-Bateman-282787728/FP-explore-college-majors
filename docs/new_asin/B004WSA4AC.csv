8445694,5,B004WSA4AC,Important note: do not buy this unless you have seen or purchased evil eye- series part 1.  This is the second half of the series and unless you have seen the first half you will be lost.  This two DVD set finishes off the series and we finally crown a new queen.  Will it be one of our heroines a villainess or the old queen. There are extras on this DVD the end credit song without subtitles and short skit of the girls in school of course with the gratuitous nudity.,1369440000,,469,4.131868131868132
8445695,5,B004WSA4AC,This series ends in a good way. A great story with even more great characters that you feel that you're part of the story itself! Don't miss out on this show!,1314489600,,158,4.129032258064516
8445696,5,B004WSA4AC,"As the final fights are fought, the body count rises.  Friend fights friend and hopes and feelings are put to the test.  The remaining fighters really have to dig deep with all their fortitude and willpower to move to the next level, and as this goes on Queen Aldra and her shadowy ally plot to keep her on the throne.  But a fight between Naniel and Arie gives a clue as to how to finally defeat the two of them.  Can Leena, Tomoe and the others use this to finally bring an end to the tournament.

The final part of the series comes to an explosive conclusion.  Overall I liked the show, it was well written and the action was smooth flowing.  Each character came to life with good voice acting and good development throughout the series.  And while there was a lot of flesh flashing and some rather lewd body language(the holy poses of Melfa being the main example), it actually did not deter from the story.  Give it a watch, but it is not for children.

Good luck.",1313452800,,969,4.333333333333333
8445697,5,B004WSA4AC,"Greetings;

It may be some time before I finally have the time to watch the show and give a review of the show itself, but just a few things I would like to point out to anyone who is considering buying this series. First and foremost, if you read the information that is given by amazon, it would lead you to believe that there is only one disk in the second volume. Secondly, that the language is only set in Japanese with the options of an English subtitles. Neither of these points is the case. There are actually two disks to this set and it is in fact dual language, both English and Japanese. The set also includes the last three OVA episodes 10-12, continued from the first volume as well as the first season. Each OVA episode is only about 3-5 minutes in length in general. A few other technical things to point out that might be worth mentioning is that this is produced by anime works, I have bought a number of their products and they do not tend to include any sort of inserts-ads for other available or upcoming products as you might normally receive from a funimation product. Secondly, the cases-at least in the dvd models tend to not be of the highest grade. Of the some six products of theirs that I have bought, nearly all of them seem to not close properly and those that have multiple disks in the case tend to have at least one shake loose in transit. That last point might fall under dumb luck and you all may not experience it, but all the same, I have had it happen often enough that it makes me think harder about buying online or hoping a copy becomes available locally for my inspection before purchasing.

Otherwise, do like the series. Definetly fan service oriented. Eiken and KanoKons also come to mind. All very fan service oriented and largely driven. Not necessarily a bad thing either mind you, but still.

Thank you...",1312070400,3,1855,4.45
