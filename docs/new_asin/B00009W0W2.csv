7993807,4,B00009W0W2,"Can't believe there are no songs from his 1987 album ""One Good Reason"", though.
Carrack performs a dozen and a half songs from his underappreciated career.  Sound is DTS and is stellar.  The concert production itself is somewhat small in scale, but the video experience does not suffer for that.
ONLY weak spot in the concert is when Carrack's 15 year-old back-up singer vamps a little bit during ""How Long"".  Her vocal vamping just seems a bit too derivative of how young pop divas sound when trying to show off their ""musicality"".  But that particular vamp phrase I am talking about here only lasts about 6 seconds, so maybe I'm getting too picky, huh?
Another reviewer here is right: this is good ""background"" concert music - music to play while you're doing other things.  It is not exactly a showcase performance visually, but still worth listening to.",1071187200,4,857,4.802721088435374
