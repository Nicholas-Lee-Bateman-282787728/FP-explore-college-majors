8336864,5,B001QYBPSU,"Steve got everything right on this DVD... the songs he chose to include, the arrangements of the songs, really good camera shots of the left hand making the chords, the chord sequences he uses, going at the right speed so that you can follow what he's doing... excellent work! This will definitely take you beyond basic rhythm to being a stand-out rhythm player. I have almost all of his DVD's and this is my favorite by far.... highly recommended!",1362441600,5,448,4.6835443037974684
8336865,5,B001QYBPSU,"You can't beat Steve Kaufman when it comes to bluegrass instruction on the guitar. He is articulate, patient and obviously very talented. He then goes the extra mile to share his abilities to enhance your learning experience. His lessons are definitely geared to those that have some experience (more than pure novice). I believe that a total novice could learn starting with this DVD, however, I think that anyone who is just starting would prefer learning with Steve Kaufman's Basic Bluegrass Rhythm Guitar DVD. Steve Kaufman also has several other instructional disks that are all great. He is a marvelous player/picker. I believe anyone who aspires to excel in bluegrass guitar will benefit from any of Steve Kaufman's instructional videos. They certainly have helped me.",1349568000,9,775,5.208
