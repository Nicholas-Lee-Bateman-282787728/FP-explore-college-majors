8188771,5,630369473X,"WHAT A GRACIOUS CITY. HOME OF MASERATI, FERRARI,BEST BALSAMIC VINEGAR, PARMIGIANO REGGIANO, G. ROSSINI AND THE MOST SUPREME  FERNANDO & LUCIANO PAVAROTTI.  I HAVE NOT REVISTED THIS AREA IN OVER 30 YEARS. THE  VIDEO BRINGS ME BACK. AN EXCELLENT VIDEO FOR ALL. OPERA FANS WILL SALIVATE!  VINTAGE FILM CLIPS OF CARUSO, SCHIPA, GIGLI & G. STEFANO (LUCIANO'S  FAVORITE) SINGING THEIR HEARTS OUT.  IT IS AMAZING THAT WHEN I WAS A CHILD  MANY EARLY MOVIES (NOT OPERAS) HAD A SCENE WITH AN OPERATIC PIECE BEING  PERFORMED MAINLY PRINCIPAL TENOR AS FOCAL POINT. THIS COULD BE A MYSTERY,  OR DETECTIVE DRAMA. A NIGHTCLUB SCENE INSTEAD OF A CHANTEUSE, AN ARIA OR AN  ACT WAS PERFORMED EVEN WHILE THE MOVIE'S MAIN THEME WAS ONGOING.  THE  VIDEO SHOWS THE RESPECT LUCIANO SHOWS HIS PAST COLLEAGUES AND EVEN CURRENT  ONES. THE MODENSE SHOWING THEIR LOVE FOR MUSIC  ALMOST AN OBSESSION.  EARLIER FILM OF A VERY HANDSOME LUCIANO IN JAPAN AS 'IL DUCA MANTUA'  EXTREMELY A CHOICE PIECE WORTH THE PRICE OF THE VIDEO ALONE. LUCIANO'S  REVERENCE TO HIS LOCAL MODENSE, AND AS ALWAYS NEVER A DEROGATORY STATEMENT  OF PAST OR CURRENT TENORS. FERNANDO SHOWING HIS FORTITUDE AND EVEN A  EARLIER RADIO PERFORMANCE BY HIM WAS EXCELLENT. IN HIS EIGHTIES AND HE  SINGS EFFORTLESSLY  THE SCENES WITH LUCIANO SINGING RARELY PERFORMED ARIAS  WITH THE GREAT LEONE MAGIERA AT THE PIANO ARE PRICELESS. LEONE'S COMMENTS  REGARD OPERATIC TENORS BEING VERY INFORMATIVE GIVES US ALL ANOTHER  PROPECTIVE TO ENJOY THE NEXT OPERA OR CONCERT WE VIEW. I RECEIVED THIS  VIDEO AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT AND VIEWED SAME SEVERAL TIMES.  RINGRAZIARE  LISA, MATT, VANESSA, NICOLE.",949622400,4,1625,5.011278195488722
