beheadings and many other true videos of a shocking nature.  I thought I was inured to viewing anything
of a disturbing nature; however, Megan is Missing prompted me to advise friends and family to view a
copy to protect their offspring from some very real homicidal pedators.

4425366,5,B004LXBKEC,"It's difficult to review this. My initial reaction, while watching, and after, I honestly wished I had not rented it. It's hard to watch, at times I wanted to turn it off. I've heard people say teens should see this, but I don't agree. It's to graphic and disturbing for a teen to watch.
This is something parents might want to see, but be prepared to be disgusted. As for the girls who played the main characters, both were very good. I am giving it 5 stars because it honestly moved me, and also sickened me. I would never watch it again. It is not entertainment, not sure what it is.

4425367,1,B004LXBKEC,"I am an avid fan of horror, thriller, and important message movies. These are what Megan is Missing appears to be from the outside, however beneath the surface lies a disgusting mess of torture porn which destroys the intended message. This movie is meant to raise awareness of internet predators, but the last 30 minutes of the movie are so vile that any take home message is lost and you the viewer are left highly disturbed and ready to throw up. This movie is utter trash and should not be seen. BEWARE.... the unrated rating should be R or NC-17 as disturbing imagery of young girls in sexual torture devices is shown as well as a gut-wrenching and utterly vile graphic rape scene of a 13 year old is shown. This movie had potential, but lowers itself bellow slime with the approach taken.

DO NOT WATCH!!!!!!!! DISTURBING AND VILE FILM.",1304985600,8,842,4.613333333333333
4425368,5,B004LXBKEC,This film was horrifyingly realistic and chilling to watch.  The choice to make it seem like real camera footage from cell phones and computer screens worked extremely well with the feel of the script.  The acting on the part of the two girls was amazing. I often forgot I was watching actors.  Congratulations to the director and anyone who was a part of making this important message.,1304899200,4,386,4.731343283582089
4425369,2,B004LXBKEC,"the only thing writer/director Michael Goi achieves is making Megan, 100 percent repugnant from the start. You don't care about her because he goes out of his way to present her as the kind of kid who probably deserves a good punch to knock her off her pedestal. Honestly, I was so sick of hearing her speak her petty, self-absorbed yapping, I couldn't wait for her to go missing. This is amateurish trash disguised as an ""important"" message movie.

The entirety of ""Megan Is Missing"" is tough to watch -- not because of its finger-pointing, ""it could happen to you"" approach, but because it's simply dull. If you've ever wanted to see the feet of a guy as he uses a shovel to move dirt for nearly 12 minutes -- and that's no exaggeration -- this is your movie.

Thanks Rod Lott",1304553600,5,778,4.471830985915493
4425370,1,B004LXBKEC,"This is really ugly stuff folks. This 'movie' is basically just a lot of obnoxious footage of 2 irritating teenage girls making YouTube style videos calling each other 'bitches' and 'sluts''. They throw in some fake looking 'news reports' (why can't they ever get the right words at the bottom of the screen that look like the words you see on an actual news report?), and finally the last few minutes shows the fate of these irritating girls which is actually really vile. There's no gore here whatsoever but the final few minutes are vomit-inducing and I really can't believe they allowed this thing on Amazon. Curiosity seekers will get burned badly and won't be able to get some of these sick images out of their heads and TOTAL sicko / psychos now have some new masturbation material.

4425371,3,B004LXBKEC,"Just finished watching this movie and this is my first review....

instead of doing a typical background story of the movie i think most of you know what its about if you have gotten this far.

this movie isn't bad but isn't good either.  the two girls that play megan and amy does a good job acting ""normal"". matter fact they may be the only two that are believable. this is another in the ""found footage"" genre. i wish i could say this was executed properly in a genre that doesnt have to be seamless in its delivery  and allowed to be a bit weak in traditional movie styles. in Megan is Missing the goal is in filming is to take newscast, camera phone (that i assume is to be a version of iphones facetime), webcam, and camcorder footage and sew together a story of two missing girls.

the biggest problem is its not believable  at all when it comes to the found footage. There is too much clarity when it comes to the webcam and the video calls. its hard to get pass this when you are suppose to believe tis found footage. the friends came off as acting and the  voice over work of the josh guy was just awkward. the last half hour is very chilling  to watch  as the director did little subtle things to get a rise out of the viewers. actually the last 30 minutes works better than the rest of the movie that was very slow paced  and seemed random .

there were just too many points where there was filming for the sake of filming. there are points when u think why were they recording this and points where you think how does these videos situations become logged to be watched again. all in all this is a midlevel execution of what could have been a very chilling production had it gotten a little bit more TLC and focus. if a bit of logic would have been applied in the camera work and mechanics there would have been a feel that this piece was actual footage. Megan is Missing feels more like a pitch for a movie than an actual movie. nonetheless it is worth a watch just for the last ""22 minutes of unedited footage"" . i hope i wasn't too all over the place with my review thanks for reading",1304467200,2,2100,4.225
4425372,5,B004LXBKEC,"Megan Stewart, 14, and her best friend Amy Herman, 13, though opposites in personality, are best friends. Megan carries the front of being the most popular girl in school, but this masks a lifestyle of hard partying, drugs, alcohol and indiscriminate sex. Amy, unpopular and socially awkward, clings to her relationship with Megan as a lifeline to social acceptance. Together, these two young girls forge a deep friendship based on their mutual needs. Using all the technology accessible for meeting people and chatting, the two girls regularly communicate by webchat cameras or cell phone, and even meet boys online. As Megan seeks friends who are different from her usual posse of hanger-ons, she meets a 17 year-old boy named Josh in a chat room. Megan and Josh bond quickly, leaving Amy feeling a bit left out. One day, Megan goes to meet Josh in person, and she is never seen again. Amy launches into a concentrated effort to find her friend. Josh is initially sympathetic to Amy's efforts, then begins to be abusive to her online. As the media swirls around the story of Megan's disappearance, Amy suddenly disappears as well. The movie plunges you into the hell of the real world as seen through the eyes of a child.

Based on seven actual cases, MEGAN IS MISSING is an uncompromising, gut-wrenching view of the world children live in today. Harrowing in its realism, the film uses only fact-based incidences to depict the lives of ordinary kids walking in the midst of extraordinary evil. I saw this film at a screening in New York, and it is simply the most disturbing movie you will ever see. There is a party scene that feels like the cameras just drifted into a real party and recorded all the sex and drinking that kids do when they lie to their parents about where they are at night. It is impossible to forget, and once you get over the shock of what you've experienced (and experienced is exactly the right word, because the movie is filmed in such a way that it makes you feel that it's happening NOW) you start looking at your own life and your own neighborhood in a different way. There are news broadcasts in the film that look just like you've turned on the TV in your house and there's a story about an abducted child. And without giving too much about the ending away (although the very beginning of the film has a title card which explains exactly what will happen in the film, and you are still shocked when it does happen), the final moments of the film leave you feeling so horrified and numb that I forgot to take a breath. The two young actresses in the film, Amber Perkins (who I believe is the niece of actress Elizabeth Perkins) who plays Amy and Rachel Quinn who plays Megan, give such realistic performances that it is sometimes difficult to believe that they are performers and not real people. You never really see the man who is their predator, but his presence is creepy. This is a film about children which is definitely NOT for children to see. It is unrated, but would definitely be an NC-17 or a very strong R.

The DVD is widescreen (1.78) and anamorphically enhanced. There are many split-screen sequences in the film when the girls are talking to each other on their cell phones or on the computer, so you can see both sides of the conversation at the same time. The sound is in stereo without prominent surrounds, which is in keeping with the style of the movie. There is a director's commentary track where he talks about all the actual events that inspired the scenes in the film, a producer and cast commentary track where the young actresses discuss how they felt about performing difficult scenes, a deleted scene, cast interviews and a video interview with Marc Klaas, whose daughter Polly Klaas was abducted and murdered. He talks about why the film made an impression on him and what parents can do to safeguard their children in this age of electronic communication.",1297641600,13,3921,4.656565656565657

I don't ever want to talk about what is in this or see it ever again. I'd rather watch a horror torture movie. It's seriously that hard to watch. I get the feeling that they were trying to do a good thing by putting together something to frighten parents and teens enough to be more careful with decisions they make but they went over the top. The first half will have you wondering what the fuss is about but the second half is horrifying and not in a good way.

4425396,4,B004LXBKEC,"This is a disturbing movie, and not a particularly entertaining one.  But that doesn't mean it's bad.  What makes Megan is Missing disturbing and not-entertaining is the hyper-realistic way in which it depicts online sexual predation, rape, and murder -- and in real life, these things are profoundly degrading, messy, and cruel, and impossible for any normal person to enjoy watching being done to someone.  It's worth being reminded of that occasionally.

The movie claims to be based on a true story -- whether that's a fib a la Fargo, I don't know, but it's undeniable there are adults out there who do these things to children and adolescents, and that makes it hard for me to completely oppose capital punishment.",1500854400,,719,4.917355371900826

4425401,5,B004LXBKEC,"This movie is disturbing. It's cringe-worthy. But it's also reality. To dislike it because it's ""explotative"" or ""pornography"" is to essentially turn a blind eye to our children and what they are exposed to during peer pressure. Megan was targeted from the age of 10 by older men who knows she'll give them what they want, because she likes attention - yet, at the core of it, she's a good person. I liked that they gave her character depth and vulnerable likeable personality. She was essentially the popular school party girl, but she had a good heart, and there were reasons she was the way that she was. The actress was also very good.

Her friend, Amy, was a little less believable, with the ""perfect"" family and ""virginal"" nature. I do understand that she was supposed to be a direct contrast of Megan, but she didn't seem to find that depth. She had an endearing innocence that made me like her character, but the actress wasn't as strong as the actress who played Megan. Still, I thought they were both good.

This leads me to think that the other actors in the movie are the ones being criticized (and that wouldn't surprise me because they were pretty bad...) The two main actresses carried the movie. Megan, more notably.

The film was grim, but it's a reality we have to face as a society. This is what happens to children when they are the victims of predators. We have to educate them on the dangers of becoming a victim - and in order to do that, we have to face some ugly truths. I applaud this movie for having the courage to give a realistic thriller and not pander to sugar-coating what it means to be a kidnapping, murder, and/or sexual abuse victim.

This should make any viewer uncomfortable, or the movie isn't doing its job. If you DO feel uncomfortable, then you aren't ready to face the realities of these topics. That in itself is a danger.",1497312000,2,1867,4.531157270029674

4425454,5,B004LXBKEC,"The movie was disturbing.  Yes.  I refuse to give it a poor rating because it rattled me.  And it did.  It made me sick to my stomach.  I was mad and saddened --there is not a happy point in this movie.  The reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's raw and it's an accurate portrayal of what happens when kids try to find love and acceptance through technology, sex, alcohol and drugs and popularity.  To me, there wasn't a lot of emphasis on peer pressure causing the kids to engage in risky behavior for attention, but more about what is going on inside the kids individually.  Megan's home life was depressing and what is horrifying is that I know there are countless kids trying to navigate life with the same problems.  THAT is what is most sickening about the movie to me.  I have nieces and I'm so sufficiently horrified that I am planning to sit down and talk with them about this movie.  Maybe I'll watch it with them.

I thought the acting was really good...especially by the character of Amy---I don't know how old this actress really is, but she played the part of the young, naive, innocent teen enduring a horrific nightmare amazingly well. This was worth the rental fee--but be prepared for an emotionally haunting and very disturbing story that feels (and can be/is) so real that it truly is horrifying in the scariest way ever..... even though you never actually see the ""monster"" directly.

The only reason I decided to watch this was because everyone kept saying the ending is either scary or disgusting and in my head I thought, ""Well, it can't be THAT bad."" It was. And the guy who made this film must be some sick kind of freak playing out his own perverted fantasy. He said he made this movie to show families the danger of internet chat rooms.

A scene (a long scene) where the two actresses are live chatting with one another about one of the character's first sexual experience seems overly graphic and unnecessary.

4425478,3,B004LXBKEC,"In regards to Megan is Missing as a movie goes, it's not too bad. The acting is pretty bad, but as fans of the horror genre, we usually don't care about the terrible acting that we get with the more ""underground"" style of horror movies. It's also somewhat of an original idea for a horror movie. This movie came out in 2011, and we all knew the dangers that come with internet chat rooms. long before this movie. I don't know of too many other movies that revolve around this danger. So, as a movie, I don't think Megan is Missing is too bad. I've certainly seen worse. My big issue with this movie is how the director tried to convince us that he created this movie to make parents and kids alike, more aware of the risks involved with the internet. Like I said earlier, we have all known the dangers associated with using the internet as a way of meeting new people, especially for kids/teens. I really think that the director just wanted to create a movie that would gain notoriety through controversial scenes, but afterwards realized that this is not really the type of ""controversial"" that horror fans like. So in an attempt to save face, he announced his attempt to protect the impressionable youth of today. There are far more notorious movies out there that make Megan is Missing look like a Nickelodeon flick. But what makes those movies more...acceptable.. is the fact that they are promoted as nothing more then brutal, tough to stomach films. So to me, this director looks like the guy who gets caught by Chris Hensen, asked to have a seat, and claims that he was ""only saying those terrible things to make the kid realize how dangerous the internet is"". Let's be real here, the first half of this film depicts a bunch of underage kids partying, drinking, and using drugs. That entire party scene, along with the girl explaining her first oral sex experience, have absolutely NOTHING to do with meeting someone online.

So, TL,DR:
Horror fans - give it a whirl. You have probably seen worse.
Parents - Your children probably already know the risks associated with internet chat rooms, but if not, this movie is not how they should learn.
Teens - You might feel like a loser after watching this movie, because it makes it seem like all of the cool kids get drunk, use drugs, and pay $10 to get into some goon's house party.

And to the director - We aren't fooled by your false claims of trying to do the right thing with the message you give in this movie. You are probably the ""Josh"" from this movie, who created this film as an outlet for your disturbing fantasies.",1491955200,,2580,4.534334763948498

It is, in my humble opinion, an excellent movie. There is nothing remotely fun about this film, it starts off that way, but takes a turn as dark as anything I have ever seen on film- maybe witnessed would be a more accurate term, because at the conclusion of this film, you discover you don't want to be there. It is utterly devastating, another viewer described it as gut wrenching- it is all of the above. It is the starkest example of what some individuals in our society are capable of that I have ever ""witnessed."" The acting is exemplary, I don't know how they did it!

The main characters were well played by the two actresses that played them, but the portrayals of the mean teenage friends fell very short and kind of seemed like a satire because it did not seem believable like the rest of the movie.

This movie was a bit like a snuff film, but I can see it serving its purpose by showing younger teens that same real bad people can contact you through social media.

Megan is Missing is a statement for all of us this day and age of electronic mayhem.

We can sit here and go on and on about how my kid knows better or I know the rules about not giving info out and so on but that is just not enough anymore. The don't talk to strangers rule is out of the question and broken every second of the day with social networking. The don't accept candy from strangers is out of the question as one signs on into chat rooms and game spots and text messaging as strangers use the electronic world as there new candy with look at this picture or look at that video, which makes it all the more easy to draw the one in, for the later kill.

As you watch the news as more and more kids and teenagers and adults go missing they all have one thing in common lately and that's social networking, meeting people online, total strangers no longer need to stalk in the darkness of the night or hide behind a windowless van asking have you seen my puppy.

All they have to do is send a Friend Conformation, a ping on the phone or welcome in a chat room. That brings me to this reality based film that leaves a true horrifying numbness on the viewer. Two girls, best friends one a little wild, the other an image of innocent. Megan has her demons that have controlled her life and basically created a hollow less soul joining in, to just feel as if she belongs and to cope and wash away the darkness of her past.

Megan is Missing is a movie designed to scare girls and boys off of the internet.

Review:
The first half of the movie is about the party life of a 14 year old girl. She has snobby friends and a nice friend that her snobby friends hate. The third quarter of the movie is where it gets interesting- Megan meets ""Josh"". Megan believes Josh and his lie about his cam being broken then proceeds to meet with him. After going out and mentioning Josh, Amy gets kidnapped too. To jump from everything being okay to torture and rape is beyond my comprehension. Producers and directors are supposed to know how to transition into those types of things. This movie was party, video diary, fake kid, rape and murder. There wasn't too much of a story to it. The gore was good and the rape really is disturbing. I love gory movies and the rape was it for me with this movie. The torture/rape/murder part was probably the best part not because it was boring but because the first three quarters of the movie was entirely boring.

Opinions that connect this to life:
Yes, this does really happen but like this, probably not? To the reviewer who went on about the girls being ""slutty"", I don't know where you live but girls around my area are modest, good girls with loving families. Get out of the 60's because showing skin is more common now and less taboo.

What we have to remember is that Megan was easily lured by Josh after he lied about his camera being broken. This is totally avoidable by refusing to talk to that person if they won't video chat and blocking them. The only fool proof way of not being ""Catfished"" is to stay off the internet. I HIGHLY recommend you watch Catfish if you haven't already, it's not gory and no one died but it actually happened. Use common sense on the internet and you should be okay. My generation is more gullible than I would like to admit. I'm sixteen and I have been Catfished and I did have to go to the police but that was my own stupid fault. Don't speak to strangers, it's a kindergarten lesson.",1402876800,,2043,4.428191489361702
4425610,4,B004LXBKEC,"I researched the *****SPOILERS******** and I have this to say. Because of what the spoilers described, I will watch it because I have not experienced the film and the ""spoilers"" do not bother me (from an entirely different era of thinking--though NOT from THIS era of thinking...Thank GOODNESS.....anyway, some of the reviews (SOME) were not helpful because so many of them wanted this to be a Lifetime Movie Event/ Disney ""DD"" feature where smart-ass back talking girls gain victory in the end. This is about REAL LIFE. I would not be looking to spend money on what any of us can watch on today's BS cable.

 I was not looking for that. I was looking for some one to take a chance on telling the truth. I am looking for someone finally, to tell these girls that this is NOT going to work. That mean girl mess can only get you so far in the real world.

Somethings DO remain the same, like, at the end of the cute, mean girl, shallow talk, a young man will want a wife in the end, or a real woman. You can act and look like little miss ""Hayley"" and the airbrush half naked, high pitched pre-recorded voice whiner over the radio (that unoriginal music that sounds like the same girl is singing the same lyrics over and over again) with the exact same part on the exact same side of the hair with the platinum blonde rinse and those terrible ""hoe sandalled"" heels with low riders (I can go on , but won't because they know the look and it simply gags).

Every girl even looks the same in the movie as in real life. Guys get bored with this eventually, it is all a fad for a minute and when the rubber meets the road, it's like NEXT!!!

Also, I completely disagree with anyone who believes that this is how girls behaved at 14. I would like to say, please ONLY  refer to those born AFTER 1980 because 14 year olds WERE not  REMOTELY compared to acting like this AT ALL, not even on a typical national level back in the 70s or 80s.

SURE there were levels of immaturity, but the 14 year old boys and girls TODAY are EXTREMELY immature, they truly, truly are.

The girls in THIS film, I nearly mistaken them to be at least 11-12. At 14 (in the 60s-late 80s) would not dare act this ignorantly and this loud (not even APART from our parents because parents were more mature and our communities were more mature and it was ALWAYS that our parents found out almost supernaturally"" whether you acted an ass at a party or in the public.

In our generation, there was NO WAY a young lady could get away with acting as these girls behaved. If any of us had, the entire community and the school would instantly brand you a whore (not questions asked and no explanations accepted) I mean that. You can bring another person in my age group on here and they will mirror the same sentiment and not ever read this review from me.

Young ladies just did not carry on this way using the N word and referring to their OWN behaviours and upbringing to THEIR OWN era or race. The use of the N word from THEIR mouths (any mouth) but so casually spoken is what makes them less than zero.

Young ladies did not speak this way, not any female in our generation of ANY race would have spoken as these girls and they are girls and not young ladies, in this film. It would have been a useless film if it were about being socially ignorant and completely uneducated as these girls behave.

The true HORROR of this film is that this is a nationally acceptable way of life for a 14 year old. The era in which we were raised, our community and our schools prepared us towards a mature expectation of behaviour in High School. This was crucial for all of us at that time.

Today's girls (and this is highlighted significantly) are poorly raised mistaking ""strong"" or ""mature"" for loud and needing a harness with a pull chain.

Parents are as frustrating blind about their child's behaviour. The parents today are okay with their children having an arrest record and tats and not being encouraged to move towards college prep or become a young person with a goal and skills even if they did not choose college.

The era before the kids born between 1980 and present are super lost, technology has nearly destroyed them, they are precocious and and sexually bold (believe me this is not a great badge of honour).

 It reflects where this society has spiralled and only those born between 1960 to 1977(1980 is even pushing it, because it would have truly began at those born in 1979.

These girls are a product of a already fallen and dysfunction society and the grand parents (not 30 year old grandparents) grand parents who are in their mid 60s would not relate to their own children acting or being raised in this way.

Watching the clips were even achingly awful because I could not even sympathise with the girls or their generation. Their behaviours need not warrant my feeling bad for their current way of thought process.

 If our children behaved as foul mouthed, disgusting and appalling as ANY of these kids, we truly would relocate OUT of the West or send them far away to a boarding school where they teach the guidelines of real life and groom them into responsible and pleasant human beings. Our children do not have to be inventors of the next problem making device for society and make billions or millions.

Today, all that we would want for our children is to be content with being their age, not having sex as if it were going to the cinema (don't get us wrong, we romantically and sexually interested young people as well) but you could count the whores--- both boys and girls--- on one hand and everyone knew them. And what was ""whorish"" back then is NOTHING to how it is today.

 Today, it is free for all and all of them are whorish in their mannerisms, the way they address their parents, the stealing, the back talk (the back talk and the loudness was enough to disown a kid in our days because they were considered a delinquent and a embarrassment and a criminal).

Young women who were 14 in High School... 25-30 years BEFORE THIS generation.... weren't allowed to dress in their underwear and call it an outfit and if they tried, at least they had two sets of clothing and tried to do this away from the community (this is NOT recommended either).

 Madonna DID start the whore underwear journey WAY before and the young ladies wanted the sexual appeal, but they did NOT strip into their camisoles and dare have their nipples showing (they wore TWO camisoles, a real bra and the faded jean jacket to where it was cute lacy and mysterious with LEGGINGS). Never revealing.

These were the days before it was in vogue to not have a father growing up. This was BEFORE the ""baby's daddy"" lingo. And this was not only ""suburban"" teens acting appropriate in our generation; normal teens all over the US were never like today's kids.

If they were, their community would pitch in and help because it meant that the teen needed special help and possibly meds.

The girls today are straight up the girls from LA red light districts that we used to laugh about and disconnect from; because if you acted like her, you got into HER kind of trouble meaning... pregnant and it was even rare to BE pregnant at 14 in the 80s (there were 2 or 3 girl in the entire and even THEY were at least about to graduate, they were treated with respect, and was it was STILL worrisome ENOUGH that they had to take separate classes so that the rest of the teenagers would not view this as typical or a mistaken option). Being pregnant was one of our main issues of concern because this was not the goal compared to NOW.

We were NEVER to mistreat or make them to be an outcast when we saw them, but it was an unspoken social function which spoke loud and clear that this was NOT the option. The mile shock would be (and let me repeat MILD shock .....would be to get pregnant at 17 and the average young lady was SCARED to get pregnant at 17---we had enough sex-ed and ABC After school Specials to warn us about this and sex and the music...it was enough to only make out and for the boys to be grateful with a handful under the shirt and keep the shirt on because we were THAT scared that to LOOK at a penis meant you may have missed your period.

So, I will purchase this movie, but only for the content that this is based on a true story and not to think that ANY of the behaviour in this film is adorable or even remotely humorous.

The language is trashy and the girls behave and are WAY younger acting than 14. This entire generation would be considered yesterday's losers to act this way during our teen years.

These things are not meant to insult, but it was an entirely different time. I was appalled by the difference and any sympathy was embarrassed FOR them and not in spite of it.

There is no excuse for a 14 year old to act this horribly and if this is the kind of future than any of us are looking towards where young folks act THIS nasty, then we are ALL in for more than a seat belt. We will need body armour, helmets and possibly WMD if this is what the damned future holds and none of it looks promising at this point.

If we witness any 14 year old acting like this, our community today will contact the authorities and then THEY can legally tear their little asses up with much BLESSING; if EVER the young girls or boys are acting this out of control at the mall or on their iPhones (they will be thrown in a compactor with their outfits) in our presence. You can count on it.

 If this is scary GOOD, it will save the lives of those who need to clean up their mouth and their act and KNOW that their behaviour comes from their HOME and not being ""inspired"" or ""influenced"" by another race of people that they repeatedly disrespect with their derogatory mental illness.

In fact, they seem as if all of their parents were smoking meth and 1000% proof EVERCLEAR WHILE they were"" in vitro"".

They cannot blame this new type of 14 year girl based on some videos and another race. THIS is the ignorance of this ""new nothingness of a generation"".

 Watch and learn how NOT to be a potty mouth , slutty little racist whore and then you JUST may make it to your graduation from High School in time to listen to Pomp and Circumstance.",1401926400,,10209,4.37936507936508

4425643,2,B004LXBKEC,"MEGAN IS MISSING is the story of two 14-year-old best friends who, within three weeks of each other, both fall prey to the same internet predator.  Told through video chat logs, video diaries and news reports, we watch the story of shy, reserved Amy Herman and her best friend, outgoing party girl Megan Stewart over the course of a month, during January of 2007.

Through another friend, Megan meets SKATERDUDE online, a guy named Josh who Megan thinks is a pretty decent guy.  She agrees to meet him for ice cream one evening, and is never heard from again.  Amy tells the police Megan had made plans to see ""Josh"", and ""Josh"" doesn't take kindly to this, so he threatens Amy to leave him alone.  A few days later, Amy turns up missing as well.

The plot of MEGAN IS MISSING is very simple, and I'm quite sure is meant as a warning to parents and children about the dangers of the internet and how easily kids and teens can fall victim to online predators.  Unfortunately, this is such a bad movie, the point becomes lost in a quagmire of terrible dialogue delivered through bad acting and a third act that is nothing but a gratuitous re-enactment of a fetishist's wet dream.

Michael Goi wrote and directed the movie and while I'm sure there are plenty of older people out there who have an ear for teen dialogue, this particular 52-year-old does not.  I didn't even need to check imdb to know that whoever wrote this was nowhere near the age these girls are supposed to be.  Every line sounds like it was written by someone whose only connection to the teenage crowd is through teen movies.

But maybe a decent cast could have at least read this nonsense in a convincing enough way it didn't ring so false, or at least helped Goi to rewrite some of the dialogue so it didn't sound so forced.  That's what a decent cast could have maybe done.  This wasn't a decent cast.

I've no doubt in real life Amber Perkins and Rachel Quinn are fantastic people, but the acting here left SO much to be desired.  Hey, maybe it's because Perkins was in her early 20s trying to play 14.  That could be a contributing factor, early 20s, badly-written 14-year-old dialogue, it's not a winning combination no matter how talented an actress is in that role.  And I find it hard to believe that out of everyone in this fairly large cast of supposed-to-be-high schoolers, there wasn't one good actor.  But the evidence on film doesn't support that theory.  If you're going by what's onscreen, Goi grabbed a bunch of people off the street, showed them the lines and said, ""Action!"" without bothering to make sure they knew how to read.

The law of averages aside, Perkins and Quinn were the stars, and by the time we get to a scene in the movie where they're allowed to stop reciting this ridiculous dialogue and have to actually emote and show range, we've already sat through over an hour of tediousness and we just don't care anymore.

Then there's that final 22 minutes.  Amy was abducted while filming her video diary, talking about missing Megan.  And the final 22 minutes of the movie is supposed to be the unedited footage recorded by her kidnapper.  The scenes of her captivity, torture, rape and murder add absolutely nothing to the story.  In fact, ending on her abduction may have offered the film a chance at redemption by actually going out on a dramatic moment, leaving us wondering just as Amy's and Megan's parents were left wondering.

To force us through the blow by blow of Amy's ordeal doesn't make us feel for Amy, it just makes us not like the director any more than we already didn't in the first place.

I'm sure the argument of ""but it's reality"" could be thrown in there somewhere; lots of people film their crimes for whatever reason.  But as a story element, it offers nothing.

MEGAN IS MISSING is billed as a horror movie, but don't be fooled.  This is exploitation, pure and simple.  There's no moral, there's no character development, there's not even a lesson to be learned in the end.  If I had to guess, I'd say Goi saw a story on the news about abducted kids and thought it would be interesting to see what happens to the kid after the abduction.  But you can't just have a movie of nothing but torture and rape, you have to have characters to root for.  So let's write a movie about two best friends who both have the same incredibly bad fortune to fall prey to the same guy.  Then we show them being tortured and raped and, since we got to know them, the audience will then sympathize even more.

Nope, that didn't work out so well.  It's not a totally terrible idea for a cautionary tale, but I think for a cautionary tale to really work, you have to not cringe at every line out of the characters' mouths.  This is an idea that could possibly work in the right hands, it just wasn't these hands, unfortunately.",1382918400,,4833,4.5

I saw this movie on Netflix a while back, alone in the house, late at night. One of the other reviewers said it perfectly...you have no idea what's coming as you watch. I too was laughing off this movie as I watched, nearly shutting it off, and then it took a turn. Yes, a large part of it is listening to these 2 teenage girls prattle on and some viewers are mentioning their poor acting, but I actually thought the acting was decent. Yeah, they sound ridiculous because they are 2 TEENAGE girls. That IS the way they sound! Anyway, as everyone else has mentioned, the last half hour of this movie is very hard to watch. You almost feel like you're doing something wrong by watching. Very horrifying, depressing, and disturbing. The kind of movie that leaves you afraid of the world and everyone in it because, let's face it, this stuff does indeed happen. This movie reveals a glimpse of a world that is all too real for some. If you love horror movies like myself and really just like the fun ride that they provide, this is NOT your movie. This movie is not fun.

4425649,2,B004LXBKEC,"The point that Michael Goi is making is pretty clear: Be cautious of people you meet online as they might kidnap you behind a diner and bring you to their torture dungeon.

It's just a very hard film to take seriously though until the last the 20 minutes. The acting and writing are quite terrible, plus there are many aspects that just simply don't make sense. Like apparently girls get ready for school in front of their recording web-cam (instead of, I don't know, a mirror?), and everyone used face-time on their cell phones for communication instead of texting or calling, despite the fact that the story is supposed to take place in 2007. And somehow an internet predator who knows nothing about the girl, except her name and what school she goes to, finds her under a bridge in the middle of no-where to kidnap her. I guess he could have followed her from school, but with all of the other excruciating boring details they have in this film, they couldn't have had a shot of Amy filming herself where some dude is following her? And yes, most of the movie is excruciatingly boring. But there are parts in the first hour that are so terribly acted/written that you might bust out laughing. I feel like Goi was so focused on traumatizing people about internet predators that he wasn't really thinking about how logical his way of story-telling was.

In terms of the quality of the film: zero stars. The two stars is for the message that Goi is trying to send. Yes, you should NOT meet strange people behind diners that you've never met or even seen their face because their web-cam was mysteriously broken by their brother, oh wait, dog -- no -- both.",1375056000,,1656,4.572390572390573

Judging by a lot of the reviews of I read on here, it looks like very many people missed the point.  And if they enjoyed it, they should be locked up.

This ""movie"" is more like a documentary with actors.  I'd even go as far as to compare it to reenactment scenes from Unsolved Mysteries.  Or maybe even like a 50's School-Scare film about something that actually matters.  Yes, it is unapologetically brutal with graphic simulations of rape and torture.  But that's the point.  The film examines a major problem in society and throws it in your face relentlessly.  The horror here is very real.  Kids go missing every day and a lot of times they don't come back alive.  The things that happen to them at the hands of their abductors are twisted and sick.  Megan Is Missing was meant to raise awareness about this.

4425674,3,B004LXBKEC,"Megan is missing is the story of two young teenage girls that live in suburbia. Their lives are plagued with the usually teen drama of fitting in, being popular,having sex, doing drugs, going to wild drunken parties, getting into arguments with your parents etc. etc. You know the usual things teens do (except turned up to the 19th power). Megan is an outspoken,pernicious,in crowd party girl, and her best friend Amy is a reserved,nerdy,timid type of girl. The two are complete opposites but their friends because each of them seems to have qualities that the other doesn't. In the film we watch the two girls carry out their adolescent lives and learn more about them and what makes them tick. The first half of the film basically is about character development for the two girls so you get to know them quite a bit. The 2nd half of the film is about why Megan is missing. The film itself feel very low budget with a pretty bad acting cast that makes the movie hard to take seriously (especially for the message they want to portray). If you were patient enough to make it through the ""Teens gone wild"" first half you are rewarded with the more interesting second half of the film.

 *This part will contain spoilers*

 After Megan is abducted by means of meeting up with a stranger she met online we get to see hints and clues as to what happened to her. We see her chained up in a basement and we see photo's of her BDSM style. The photo's are shocking or maybe disturbing to some people but honestly in the age of the internet these are pretty mild. The only thing that's shocking about them is that your mind recognizes Megan as a girl that you're familiar with instead of a random victim. When you see her in these ""uncomfortable photo's"" you start to sympathize with her(I actually felt more disturbed with her felicio scene at the teen party). After these incidents that's the last we see of Megan and then the story focuses on Amy who is abducted by the person that kidnapped Megan. We get a better idea of what Megan went through watching Amy's torture unfold as she is chained in a basement, raped,and forced to eat food like an animal. Compared to other movies the second half feels rushed and tries to throw in as much shock value as they can at the veiwer. When the real terror is the psychological trauma that the victim is going through. This is never established in this movie. You don't get to feel what Amy is thinking or the level of despair she is in (even though it's apparent) it's just the poor execution of this part of the film. ""The Girl Next Door"" gives a good idea of the victim coping with the trauma of the situation their in as Meg goes from a strong spirit that can cope with her punishment to a girl that is fading away and has given up and feels she is going to die.""The last house on the left"" (the remake) gives a good example of victim despair when the girl is swimming to her parents home after being raped and she's pretending she's swimming in a pool, instead of swimming for her life from her attackers. This type of mental connection is important because it allows the viewer to put themselves in the place of the victim and gives the story more impact. Shock value is okay as you'll remember being scared but you won't exactly remember how scared the girl was or how hopeless she felt which is what this film wanted to establish. Instead you just have people talking about how ""That Scene"" scared them.

Now about ""that scene"" it's probably the most if only brilliant part of this film. At the point were focusing on Amy we have forgotten about Megan as she's long gone out the picture at that point. What happened to her? Where did she go? Where is she?. Well it just so happens that Megan has been there all along. As we see the abductor pull a lid off a blue barrel that contains Megan's decomposing corpse. This scene itself is worth watching what is mostly a cheesy movie. They did an excellent job with this part of the film. The look of despair on Megan's face is perfect. The hopelessness in her captured in her eyes and facial expression in her last moments of life. You think about a girl that was once so boisterous, so lively, and so aggressive,and there you see her as a lifeless decomposing corpse with the expression of despair frozen into her face. But then, the movie just drops the ball on this and turns it into another cheesy shock factor. ""Megan!!! Megan!!! noooooo!!! *insert cheesy crying*"". This was a perfect moment for the director to have shown the psychological deterioration that Amy would have went through at that point. A complete mental breakdown would have been realistic especially after the abductor threw her into the same container with this rotting corpse. Instead it just becomes a series of ""Nooo! nooo! please let me goes"" and it's as if Megan just vanished again. Amy had a better reaction to seeing her teddy bear again than seeing her dead friend and never the less being thrown and sealed into a barrel with her.

At that point the movie flashes forward to the abductor digging a hole to bury Amy and Megan with Amy begging the abductor to let her go and telling him she loves him and yelling for people to help her. It's hard to not focus on the terrible acting and it doesn't help the impact of the scene as much as it should. This carries on for 10 minutes or so till the abductor kicks the barrel containing her and Megan into the hole and covers it up then walks away. Is the scene shocking? Yes, I guess you can say it is. Does it cross over the impact that it should of had? Not really. At this point Amy is only doing what she has since we first see her abducted and that's begging for him to let her go and screaming for help. It doesn't portray the development she should have gone through after being raped and having her virginity taken, being forced to eat food like a dog, chained up in a dark cell, and on top of that seeing her friends rotting corpse and being stuffed in a container along side her. It's as if none of this even registers with Amy and it should. The director/writers never seem to develop the victim realistically. When people are put into these types of situations they break down mentally. That break down is what the impact of the film should have been instead of the horror like shock value. A teen from a good suburban home is kidnapped and forced to go through gruesome/violent acts that turns her into someone that was far from what she started out as. That is more realistic and closer to what actual survivors of these types of situations endure if they are able to be saved. They are never the same again.

Now the thing about ""Amy is Missing"" that I think is somewhat of a deception is that the movie emphasizes on the dangers of meeting a stranger online and ""this could be you"". When that's far from the reality. This could be anyone. You don't have to meet someone online to end up in this situation. You can be abducted walking home from school, walking to your car, right in your own home, etc. etc. The type of people that do these things are predators that know how to get away (which is usually why they're rarely caught until they become over confident and make a mistake). When these predators abduct women they go after girls that people won't be searching high and low looking for like prostitutes,homeless girls,runaways,women that are minorities etc. etc.. Which cases have shown tend to be the usual victims for acts like this. When Girls like Megan go missing in most cases it's done by someone they know or someone local that's been stalking them. This film gives the abductor a blank face and a blank motive. Whether it's done on purpose so that the viewer focuses on Megan and Amy or because they just don't know how to develop characters. It just makes the movie feel like a PSA announcement for middle class Caucasian females about befriending people online and a boogie man abducting you.

The film itself its pretty over the top. Aside form the ""barrel scene"" the entire abduction is pretty generic. There's Amy's rape scene which I didn't bother to talk about because it was another ""shock value"" moment. It wasn't as impacting as it should have been because it feels like it's forced on you. It goes back to the character development and mental state of Amy when she is captive. The movie never establishes what she's thinking or her desperation. So when you see her raped it's just watching someone over dramatically being raped. ""The Girl Next Door"" had a much more meaningful rape scene as by that point Meg had given up hope completely and wasn't fighting back anymore. You had a clearer picture of what she had been through, what she had endured and what her current state of mind was. In ""Megan is missing"" this scene was were the director should have established Amy's submissiveness and acceptance into her situation as her abductors captive and at his mercy. Instead it bounces from that scene to hopeful Amy again.

Overall this movie that was to have been based on real life accounts felt completely unrealistic by the characters actions. The director should have spent more time studying real victims and predators and the psychology behind it and then writing his movie around that idea, instead of making his movie about a few incidents. In a way this movie is not as serious as it should be as it comes off more cheesy than serious and in some scenes the laughable in regards to the acting. The barrel scene was brilliant however and the truly only notable/memorable part of this film. That actually is very real, and the condition investigators do find these missing girls in. They are sometimes mutilated, decomposed, discarded, half way buried, etc. etc. What was once a beautiful woman/girl is now just a rotting shell. What makes that reality even worse is that these things happen and too often. I do hope that this movie makes some of these teen girls more aware of their actions and the decisions they chose to make. It is good that they used two girls for this film. Once that was a party girl and one that was shy and timid. It gives an example that this can happen to any girl not just the party type.

With that said I give this movie a 3/5. Very bad acting,decent shock value, but if the message gets across than it was worth it. Stay safe!",1366329600,9,10329,4.504

  Aside from the villain's somewhat over-the-top lines, the dialogue is compellingly realistic, the settings and photography are spot on, and the editing is perfect.  One of the other reviewers commented that the closing fifteen minutes are gratuitously disturbing and creepy.  That may be so, but overall, this film is hauntingly fascinating and might well discourage young people from establishing blindly trusting online relationships.  However, it also may be so over the top that young people dismiss this story as overly dramatic interpretation; therefore, unlikely to resonate with their day-to-day experiences.

  This film brings to mind ""Compliance,"" which is another horrid reenactment of twisted sexual abuse visited upon young female fast food employees with--incredibly--the unwitting collaboration of supervisors.  Both of these films are excellent productions of bizarre phenomena needing to be brought to the attention of young people and parents alike.

This film is very disturbing, could have done without the photos. I won't be able to sleep for a few days. Every time I close my eyes I see those photos. It really doesn't give you any warning for what you will watch. Teens should watch it but also shouldn't. Watch it but skip the photo part. There's also a part of the footage where it shows Megan's body in a trash can type thing, skip that part too. I believe they could have gotten their point across without those parts. I just thank god I had enough seance to stop meeting people offline and nothing happened to me when I was meeting people. It is truly a wake up call.",1360800000,2,802,4.082278481012659
4425681,3,B004LXBKEC,"I came very close to turning off Megan is Missing after ten or fifteen minutes just because the acting was so bad and the characters so annoying.  I decided to stick it out and am glad I did, as this wound up being a very effective and disturbing movie.  It is riddled with problems, however.

As the two main characters Amy and Megan, Amber Perkins and Rachel Quinn turn in outstanding performances once they are allowed to do so.  Much of the dialog early on in the film seems stilted and unnatural.  Instead of simply having the actors improvise, it seems to me that dialog was written to mimic the mannerisms of tween girls by a writer who doesn't really know how tween girls talk.  It takes a while for Perkins and Quinn to inhabit their roles but they finally do so and once the movie is focusing only on them their performances shine.  During some frank and uncomfortable scenes in which Megan confides in Amy her first sexual experiences and abuse at the hands of her stepfather the two actresses are completely convincing, even moving.

Another problem is that this movie is supposed to be being told through reconstructed footage shot via a digital video camera, cell phones and webcams, yet all the footage appears to have been shot with the same camera.  This unfortunately takes away from the authenticity of the footage, as do some clumsy fake news reports that suffer from inappropriate attempts at satire and dark humor.

The characters that populate the first quarter of the movie are insufferably obnoxious and at first make it tough to sit through.  Who wants to hang out with this bunch of self-absorbed, loud-mouth children?  It took me a while to realize that this was the point.  Megan's poor choice of friends and her miserable home life have forced her to find solace in the form of an anonymous stranger who showers her with compliments and affection.  She gets the same from her flesh and blood friend Amy, but Amy can't fulfill her longing for romance.  This is the weakness (for lack of a better word) online predators use to lure their prey.  As difficult as getting through those first few scenes was, they worked.

Overall, Megan is Missing is an uneven but ultimately effective movie.  The finale is as unbearably intense as it is heartbreaking.  I definitely recommend this movie to fans of found footage horror.  Just be aware that it's far from perfect.",1360454400,,2389,4.710843373493976
4425682,4,B004LXBKEC,"This movie was extremely unsettling. Afterwards you feel hopeless, afraid, and angry especially as a parent. When you have kids every mother knows that you have three major nightmares and they are in this order; someone will hurt your kids, your child will be sick, your child will hurt themselves. However, when you watch the real life terror that families go through on tv it is like you are watching a glamorous who done it. I am guilty of it too. Are the parents at fault? Did the police botch the investigation? Are they dead? Honestly this movie made me feel ashamed of the participation I've had in media hipe surrounding these cases. When Megan has gone missing and the media sinks it's teeth into her story, they start by telling you a child is kidnapped about every 40 seconds and then they go on to talk about Megan's case. The reporter casually mentions a young boy going missing in an inner city neighborhood, like a side note, and then returns to talking about the beautiful, young, white girl that was missing. Brilliant. Most people watching the movie probably didn't even pick that up. And that was the point. The media covers missing children's cases based on which stories make for good ratings. But even this becomes trivial at the end of the movie because what happens to these children news coverage or not is the same once they have been kidnapped. People hate this movie for the last 25 minutes, but this movie is validated in those uncomfortable, horrifying moments. Because then you understand that these cases are not glamorous who done its. You understand that there is no hope, there is no calvory riding in to save them, they will not make a galliant escape. The last few moments in an abducted childs life is pain and fear. Once these sick sadistic people get their hands on them, there is no protecting them. Their fate is sealed. That is what needed to come from this film. To get serious about protecting the most valuable thing you will ever have. The news has desensitized us, the horrors these children face are vomitted out in between tips for car repairs and cutsie cat rescue stories and they mean nothing. You have to watch this film to remind yourself what those words really mean. But you won't watch it again. Bone chilling.",1360368000,12,2268,4.658354114713217
4425693,4,B004LXBKEC,"I watched this movie over the course of a week. I started watching it one day after school because there was nothing else on netflix and a friend told me ""it would creep the hell out of me."" I watched the first half hour and was like ""I can't watch this."" Literally the whole thing was chicks talking back and fourth on webcam. I understood that eventually the main character Megan would be kidnapped but I didn't think it was worth my time.

A few days past and I asked my friend why in the world he recommended it to me. I'm a guy who loves to watch scary movies-however I very rarely get scared during horror movies. Even if I'm out in a log cabin in the middle of the woods by myself. So anyway, my friend told me he wanted me to watch it because it would scare me. He said you have to make it through about the first 45 minutes and then gets interesting. So, last night around 11pm I decided to finsh it.

Let me just say that this movie will disturb the living s*** out of you. I have never ever in my life seen a movie that has creeped me out so much. It's not a movie that you will enjoy but it will teach you a lesson. It truly shows what can happen to you when you fool around with the internet. I think teenagers who play around in chat rooms should be required to see this so they can see what can happen.

I can't say I recommend this to anyone because it is truly chilling and will distrub you. However, I have never seen a movie that has put a message out so good like this one.",1359676800,3,1493,4.02020202020202

4425695,3,B004LXBKEC,"The story is disturbing and not really ""entertainment"" but it points to real risks.  The portrayal of teens is so extreme that it may have lost its impact in in overduing it.  The movie made me sad and disturbed about society.",1357603200,4,226,4.487804878048781
4425696,1,B004LXBKEC,"So I had a bro tell me to watch this movie.  Said it would scare me.  It was messed up.  Like hostile with pedos.  So I watched this thing on Netflix one Sunday morning.  It was horrible.  Not just ""I feel dirty"" horrible, but shot like crap.  Half of the movie is lame broadcasts that look like they were made with a program that came with Windows 3.1.  The acting by the girls boils down to how well they can call each other ""bitch"" and ""slut"". The best acting in this movie went to a teenager who was acting stoned in the background of a shot during a party. He looked like he knew what he was doing.  Everyone else appears to have gotten their start on Soap Operas, community theater, Jerry Springer, or Hardcore Pawn.

Anyhow, this movie hurt me.  Seriously.  What had happened was I turned this on at about 3am on a Sunday morning.  At around 3:45, I realize I can't do this alone.  So I break out a few beers and figure since I haven't gone to sleep yet, it's not drinking early, it's partying late, AMIRIGHT?

So I pound these three beers, which are some sort of domestic light that someone left over at my house, so I've already degraded myself way past the point that the director has degraded the two lead women in this film.  I hadn't really eaten anything that night so I got buzzed pretty quick.  Anyhow, I becae quite belligerent at the television for displaying such crap.  So I whip an empty bottle at it.  The television.  But I miss and send it right through my window next to the television.  And it bounces off of the hood of my neighbor's Puntang.  It's a Mustang with some custom Punisher graphics on it so he calls it a ""Puntang"".  He thinks it's funny, but I don't get the joke I guess.  Anyhow, he loves that car. I swear I've heard him at night in the middle of heavy petting sessions with the car. He's weird.

So he runs out of his house in some sort of leather cloth diaper or some such jazz and starts screaming at me through the window.  And I'm like ""Look, dude, if you were watching this movie you'd have accidentally broken a domestic beer bottle over your pervo car's hood, too.""  For some reason it sets him off, right?  He jumps through the window like a chunky, sweaty, Italian Jackie Chan and literally tears my goatee off.  I don't mean some hair, or a handful, I mean I was clean shaven when he was done with that one swipe.  It hurt like hell!  So in the middle of this he sees the ""acting"" on my television and thinks I'm watching a snuff film.  This dude thinks I'm a freak and starts beating me about the head, neck, and shoulders.  I kicked him in the junk like five times, but it didn't stop him for a split second.  Dude was a beast fueled by hatred for bad motion picture, apparently.  Eventually he has to stop because he has to pull some of my teeth out of his knuckles at which point he becomes engrossed in the final 20 minutes of the film while silently mumbling ""yeah, yeah babs, babs can't get away"" and I just lay on the floor bleeding from several orifices and then I blacked out.  The next thing I remember, my PS3 has turned itself off due to inactivity, there are some leather undies on my floor, and I have cherry lipgloss on.  And there is glitter EVERYWHERE!

So, to boil this down, I have no clue what in the Hell happened that day except that I watched a crappy movie, drank a few beers, and lost six teeth, one goatee, and every ounce of self-respect I had.  Save your dignity.  Save your time.  Save your goatee.  Don't watch this film.",1356480000,7,3505,4.2724505327245055

4425700,3,B004LXBKEC,"I've watched this film MEGAN IS MISSING a few times now, and each time I watch it I feel that it gets stronger and stronger. The first time I watched it was about a year ago with my partner. I found it to be effective in it's own way, but was so frustrated by it that I couldn't bring myself to really like it or even recommend it. I did vow that I would never watch it again, however, because even for someone like me who has seen a lot of transgressive pictures with truly disturbing subject matter (IRREVERSIBLE, COME AND SEE, THREADS, A SERBIAN FILM, THE COOK THE THIEF HIS WIFE & HER LOVER, LIE, RED WHITE & BLUE, IN A GLASS CAGE, DANCER IN THE DARK, and BAD BOY BUBBY are some of my favorite films), some of the ideas presented here angered me significantly. MEGAN IS MISSING is not a graphic film by any means. It's content isn't even as explicit as something you'd see in most slasher films. The only difference is in it's realism and in the fact that you care about the characters. However, months after first watching it, my partner and I still couldn't stop talking about it. This is honestly quite a film. It's a very fearless and intense effort that hits very close to home for a lot of people. I had to buy the DVD because I figured any film that can get two hardened film buffs talking for so long has to be taken seriously and deserves to be explored. So I bought the DVD, watched the film (with and without the audio commentaries) and all the special features, and then I watched it again. This isn't something new for me. I do this with pretty much every film I purchase. The experience of watching MEGAN IS MISSING, however, is not unlike the experience of watching KIDS. The experience is a depressing, horrible, sickening, slightly exaggerated, but extremely important one that is most definitely not for everyone but still needs to be seen by some folks. This is a film that is worth discussing, flaws and all.

Now I'm not going to pretend that this film doesn't have problems. It does. The whole presentation, in a realism sense, doesn't quite hold water. The characters chat on their cellphones via video, which I can believe. What I can't quite believe is the idea that these video logs can be captured with utmost clarity like they are presented here. Also there is a brief scene at the end that details a camera of one of the girls being found in a garbage can in a nearby park, something I don't believe a sexually sadistic man would do if he wanted his acts to be seen. A park bench? That would have made more sense. A garbage can? No way. I don't disbelieve that a mad man wouldn't do that if he were out of his head, but in the context and flow of this film it comes across as somewhat jarring and out-of-place to me, personally. Those two flaws do bring the realism of the film down a little bit, but it doesn't actually take away from the atmosphere or the tone of the film in any way, and that's the part of the film that I truly admire.

One of the most impressive aspects of the film, to me, was the way the schizophrenia of the predator in question was depicted and explored. That's a very real concept of a sexual predator. A sexual predator is someone who often feels like an outcast in society, a man who is looking from the outside in, someone who feels like they were rejected and torched by societal standards. Take a look at the film Monster starring Charlize Theron, or better yet, Man Bites Dog, a film that is brilliant in too many ways to even describe in this review. I do feel that more and more filmmakers are really getting to understand the minds of people who like to hurt people, and I also feel that film is one of the best ways to explore the minds of the diseased and the perverted. Here with MEGAN IS MISSING we have a sexually sadistic human being whose impulse is to paint and portray himself as someone that these girls would actively desire and appreciate. He plays the role of a guy who acts tough, but he also shows a nervous and weak side to him that these girls understand and sympathize with. To me, the choice of making this mad man use that as his way of luring this one particular girl in actually has a pretty startling effect. Now, I'm not going to say that the exploration of this particular psychopath's mind is as deep, as affecting, or as intense as in films such as PSYCHO, HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, the original 1988 Dutch version of THE VANISHING, FREEWAY, or even the unrelated sequel to FREEWAY, but considering that this is meant to be a found-footage picture, Michael Goi's script does a pretty damn good job at analyzing this mad man and really getting the audience into his head. You can tell that this world of psychopaths and sexual, internet and otherwise, predators is one that Michael Goi has done a lot of research with and has spent a lot of time exploring. It's actually pretty horrific in a way to see how realistically and true-to-life the scenarios in this film are presented, and therefore I'd say this would be a good film for students of psychology and sociopathic mental disorders to really pay attention to and discuss. Like I said, this film, at times, really puts you in the head of a psychopath. The effect is quite the mind screw.

The film never truly exploits it's subjects, even when it feels like it is, similarly to what Larry Clark did with KIDS. With KIDS, Larry Clark presented to us the world of these young teens and lured us into thinking that we are going to see something really exciting and edgy and dangerous, and instead revealed to us a rather digustingly sweaty world of underdeveloped kids with bad hygiene, disgusting habits, and destructive behavior. This film lays all of that out quite early on, so we get past that fairly quickly and allow ourselves to pay more attention to what is ultimately at the heart of everything. The two lead actresses, Rachel Quinn and Amber Perkins, both give incredible performances. Quinn plays the title role of Megan as damaged, destructive, and sassy and hits every vulnerable and fearful note spot on. She is very much like a lot of girls that I went to high school with, and her role here makes perfect sense in the grand scheme of the picture as sexual predators tend to go after people who are vulnerable and damaged. They also tend to go after unpopular outcasts as well, which is where the character of Amy comes in. She is pretty much pure innocence. She is intelligent, pretty, and is widely and actively shunned by Megan's friends. Amber Perkins gives the strongest performance as Amy. She totally comes across as the kind of girl I would have been friends with in middle school. Lonely, funny, and very young at heart. I can guess that perhaps part of why she is so shunned is because she comes from money. Some camera sequences depict her stable home life with a large house and a collection of very cute toys and stuffed animals. She's a wonderful character and she's what really brought the film together in my opinion. The second half of the film explores her character while the first half of the film explores Megan's character more, similarly to Lukas Moodysson's hauntingly entertaining picture SHOW ME LOVE. Also, on a side note, (and I totally don't mean this in any bad or offensive way because, like I said, I truly love her work here) I could totally picture Amber Perkins being an amazing final girl in a slasher film. Her scream is one of the best screams I've heard in a film in some time.

So now I suppose I am to talk about the final 25 minutes of the film that is supposedly so controversial. Well, I gotta say that I'd be lying if I said that I did cry pretty hard at what I was watching. I'm a sensitive person, and the idea of someone sexually abusing young teens and children is an admittedly difficult idea for me to even comprehend to this day, despite the fact that I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to how psychopaths like the one in this film think. What happens to Amy in the final act of this film, and what is implied about Megan shortly before and during the final act, is truly morbid. However, I cannot say that I was personally disturbed by it. Depressed? Yes. Shocked? I suppose. Surprised? Most definitely. However, disturbed? Not in the least. I've read far too much about, so-called, ""evil"" people in this world for the nightmarish territory that gets explored at the end to really disturb me. You want disturbing? Read the news. Read about the war. Read about what's happening in third-world countries. Read about other missing persons cases. The thing that many folks may realize but probably can't fully accept is that the case depicted in this film is a pretty mild kidnapping case in comparison to the millions and millions of atrocities committed by other sexually sadistic child abusers who have kidnapped children and teens, sometimes from their own homes, in order to systematically torture, rape, mutilate, and kill little girls and little boys who can't even comprehend the idea that someone like this could even exist in the same world as them and would want to do such horrible and inhumane things to their poor little bodies. Hell, Mark Klass, the guy who SPONSORED THE DVD of MEGAN IS MISSING had a daughter who I'd say met a far more grotesque fate than the girls in this film, when you consider the age of the girl who was kidnapped, the circumstances surrounding the kidnapping, the details of the predator, and the time it took for him to actually murder her. I've read stories about sexual predators who have raped girls and boys for days and days on end before dumping their bodies in acid, something that many folks, honestly, probably can't even comprehend the idea of a person being cruel enough to do. I'm sorry if I seem at all insensitive, but this is an issue that I truly feel very passionate about and that's probably why I'm so fascinated by this film, because Goi seems equally as passionate about it as me, if not more. This is an angry film, and that's one thing that I especially learned from listening to the commentary on the DVD. Goi knows a lot about how these people lure children in and he obviously put a lot of heart, soul, and backbone into making sure that the experience of watching this is as frustrating for us to watch as it is for him to even think about. I recommend that folks out there listen to the commentary track recorded by Amber Perkins and Rachel Quinn, because it actually is quite revealing for them to talk about what is, obviously, difficult adult material to act, for young actresses in particular. Both of them are exceptionally down to earth and are able to safely admit that being in a film like this can be a very scary and uncomfortable experience. If you found the infamous photos that appear in this film to be disgusting and horrible, try putting yourself in the role of the actress that had to ""pose"" for those photos. She has a harder time looking at those pictures than any audience member ever will. As for Perkins, her thoughts and feelings on the entire final twenty two minutes are fully of insight and honesty that I don't think even a lot of really seasoned actors and actresses could really comfortably share. The commentary tracks on this DVD are pretty great and make the DVD actually worth buying for those who at least need some kind of closure that the two lead girls are okay, similarly to the DVD of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON with the commentary track by the two male leads. The tracks almost function as an extension of the characters themselves.

Overall, MEGAN IS MISSING is not going to be a film for everyone, even for those who love disturbing and shocking films. This film, clearly, doesn't aim to simply shock and disturb. Instead, Michael Goi highlights many issues about sexual predators that many folks (not even Hollywood) don't want to truly acknowledge, and he does a very fine job given the budget and how few days it took to shoot the film. Don't get me wrong, and think that I'm one of those people who feel that children should see this film. I am NOT one of those people. History has shown that scare tactics never work, and it drives me nuts when folks like to claim that films like this and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM need to be shown in schools. I'm also not one of those people who think that sexual predators and serial killers should all be murdered. I'm very much against the death penalty, and I think killing someone who has tortured, molested, or killed innocent children prevents us from learning from them and learning about why they felt so deeply compelled to so something so awful. Killing someone doesn't make the problem go away. It never does. Murder is one of the least productive acts that any human being can ever commit, and I'm sickened and angered that folks still don't realize that. Not to get on my soapbox or anything, but look at a recent example. We killed Bin Laden. Who's to say that another psychopath won't take his place tomorrow? There will be. There always will be. Violence never solves anything. One of my biggest goals in life is to raise kids one day, and I'm not going to stop them from going on the internet just because I've seen disturbing films like this, HARD CANDY (which was flawed, but, admittedly, very brave when it came to actually showing sympathy for a sexual predator), and TRUST (which, by the way, is another very excellent film that I think takes just as many chances as this film does). Instead I'm going to educate my children about the dangers of the internet, as well as the positive elements. It's really not that hard to educate children, it just helps if you are brave and upfront with them about it, because, trust me, they are always smarter than you think they are.",1347840000,9,13770,4.521861211391897
4425701,1,B004LXBKEC,"Torture porn is all the rage these days, with talentless hacks trying to top one another with ways to abuse, strip, and torture pretty, young, screaming women. This adds to the loathsomeness level by convincing some folks, somehow, that there's a lesson here in this exploitive garbage, that teenage girls are really asking for it by being stupid, and that if said teenaged girls would only be more careful they wouldn't wind up dead, raped, and buried alive in a barrel with the dead body of their friend.

 Some commenters have defended this swill by shrugging, too bad, so sad, it's a big bad world out there full of rapists, molesters, and murderers, and that girls should watch their step and.....act like they live in Afghanistan, it seems. Funny thing is, if it's possible to makae these ""PSA"" movies are more than one self righteous twit called it,  then it's possible to nip this kind of crap in the bud, so to speak, with men and boys.  Every time some slimebag makes a movie lovingly detailing violence fetishes for the paying masses, well, he could making one detailing what happens to rapists who kidnap and murder girls. But they never do. And yet the message here is supposedly that this is GOOD to show what'll happen to those slutty little girlies who meet boys and party.

  I tend to like pseudo documentaries, but this one is vile,  more for the self righteous tone than for technical merits. It's not a PSA. It's basically a porn movie where the clothes stay on and the kink of choice is torturing little girls and then self righteously claiming it's for a good cause, or for their own good. This is not an old concept. Moviemakers have been claiming that they're doing it for womens' own good for decades. Oh, if only those stupid silly women and girls would stop putting themselves in danger! Funny how all these movies focus on stranger danger and not the fact that women and girls are most often attacked by known acquaintances, not strangers.

 There's no way to guard against that, but if you focus on the rarest form of attack against women and girls, you wind up with this dreck,  while millions of girls get raped and abused and murdered by their supposed loved ones every year, not kidnapped by some dude with an elaborate dungeon set up.

  I agree with the great Pauline Kael, who reached her boiling point after yet another detailed rape scene on screen that had male critics raving about how great the film was when she said she wanted to make a movie showing men being hurt and tortured while having the whole world call it art, shredding the pretenses that allow sexist drivel like this to find an audience.",1345248000,8,2644,4.621794871794871

4425714,3,B004LXBKEC,"This movie has been getting a lot of hype and flack for the content. So I figured I better watch and see for myself.

Honestly the first hour is painfully boring. Its two teenage girls standing in front of cell phones or cameras talking. (all of this movie is ""found footage"" from cell phones, web cams, etc. so get used to it) Some parts they discuss first time sexual activities, or being molested. Honestly pretty disturbing for someone of my age (30) to listen to as the girls in the movie are 14/15 years old. Now, if I was their age, I wouldn't have been uncomfortable really listening to them talk like this because I'd relate to their age group, but instead it was pretty disturbing and I found myself wondering what I was really in store for.

The movie starts to get a little funny. I know, its wrong of me to be laughing about it, because it is a serious issue, this sort of thing really did/does happen, and this movie was based on a few different real cases. But the problem is that the writing in this and the acting during certain scenes were just hilarious even without trying to be. Or maybe it was trying to make you laugh during this specific scene (the scene where they show, and reenact the abduction of Megan) just so they can shock you in the next shot. With a few still ""horrific"" images. Here I am laughing about this scene and these images pop up and I shut off the movie. I was alone, late at night, kinda scared of what they'd show next. Now, later I looked online or these images, and they weren't that bad, creepy, but I guess just within the context of the movie at that moment they freaked me out.

I did turn the movie back on. But I was creeped out from that point on as really that's where it turns into ""horror"".

While the overall acting, story, etc, was pretty lame. I felt as a first watch the ending made up for it as it did spook me out. However, that doesn't mean it's a great movie by any means.

This movie is not for those who have a queasy stomach, and even if you don't, like me, you may feel the need to fast forward through parts. I had to. The beginning of the movie gives you no heads up on what you're in for. It's very deceiving, which makes the end so shocking. All in all, a movie that was a little overwhelming, but as I said because of personal experience, I can appreciate the attempt in trying to show how online temptation could end up.

Most people will find this movie really great for the meaning behind these disturbing images, but for the same exact reason many people will hate that part too. I could go either way on this subject. I feel that this movie was meant to be used to scary parents into believing this could be their child. On the other hand, did they go too far and showed too much and leave nothing for the imagination? If you can handle tough love and seeing these images than you will most likely accept the facts. If you're more of a softer person and let to be let down easily than won't like this.

The main subject involves two girls, 13 and 14 year-old getting raped and murdered. There also drug use, teen drinking, teen sex, and bad parenting issues. This is a sensitive issue because of the young girls ages and images you will see.

Since, it's about young girls and actually seeing a violent rape scene and a buried alive - some people find that very graphic and disturbing to view. Others will find that this movie hit the nail in the coffin and will be a real eye-opener. People against this movie say that they could had just wrote in all that graphic stuff into the movie and not actually show it. Other people for the movie will agree with it and to really drilling the issue into people minds.

4425719,3,B004LXBKEC,"*WARNING FOR SPOILERS*

There are parts of this film that make it obvious that it is fiction, such as most of the acting.  I have to say though, that the girl who plays Amy Herman does a terrific job during the most disturbing part of the movie, which was the ""lost footage"" that shows some of the torture that she endured, including a very hard-to-watch scene of the rape.  You believe that she is being terrorized, and you believe the fear and pain she's going through, which is what makes it so disturbing.  The other scenes that she has with her co-star who plays Megan, are not very believable.  The acting is just not good.

A few things that don't make sense in the movie:

1)Amy is a very thin girl.  I don't know why she called herself pudgy in one of the scenes, and other people made reference to her being fat.  There wasn't an ounce of fat on her body that I could see, and at the end of the film when she is only in her bra and underwear, you can see how thin she really is.  Maybe the role was meant to be for someone who was overweight?  If they wanted to make it more realistic about the character being an outcast and more unattractive, they should have had the actress gain some weight for the role.

2)The webcam and video phone chat conversations that took place did not make sense.  First of all, you can't do video chat from an old Motorola Razr phone, which was clearly the type of phone that was shown she was using.  Those phones don't have the capability to do video chat.

3)When Megan's friend Lexie has her freak-out, and blames Amy for Megan's disappearance. I didn't understand why she was blaming Amy.  How would it be Amy's fault that Megan was disappearing, especially when it was Lexie who ""introduced"" Megan to Josh in the first place?  Technically it was Lexie's fault that any of that happened because she was the one who encouraged Megan to talk to Josh.  Then she started crying about how she loved Megan, and Megan loved her... as in they were in love with each other?  Her crying rant just didn't make any sense. Plus, the acting was terrible.

4)If this were reality, the police would have protected Amy (especially after Josh threatened her and her family) and probably would have tried to get her to contact Josh as a way to entrap him, get him to confess, or trace his IP address.  Also, for safety reasons, it is doubtful that the media would have been allowed to reveal Amy's name or face as the person who had information about Megan's alleged abductor.

I have read other reviews where people have said this movie is unrealistic and/or over dramatic.  I strongly disagree with that.  There really are a lot of dangers when it comes to the internet, and that goes for adults too, not just kids.  The problem is that kids are incredibly naive and vulnerable and are a lot more likely to trust someone and take them at their word, than an adult is.  That is why they are easy targets for predators.  There are teens who meet people online in chat rooms all the time, and they think that just because they have spoken to them online several times, that they really know the person.  It's no secret that people lie about who they are online, make up fake profiles, and often pretend to have different personalities.  Teenagers can often be so quick to trust.  I know a lot of them do end up meeting people online in person, and their parents don't even know about it.  I had a friend who used to regularly meet people she met online, and she would even go alone (like Megan did).  I would tell her she was crazy for putting herself in potentially dangerous situations, but she never thought it was a big deal.  Having that kind of lax attitude about meeting with strangers is what gets young girls and women attacked, kidnapped, raped, and murdered.

I think sites like Facebook make potential victims easier targets because of the ability to stalk someone without their knowing it... which is easy to do when people freely give out their personal information!  People feel the need to ""check in"" to their locations at all times of the day, list where they go to school and work, post tons of pictures, and even list their cell phone numbers.  It amazes me how much some people are willing to share about themselves online.  I think after watching this movie, hopefully people will realize the dangers of meeting strangers on the internet and will be a lot more careful.",1326758400,7,4416,4.481852315394243

4425721,1,B004LXBKEC,"There is nothing to say that hasn't been said already except that to me this movie is horrible. It is torture porn but worse then that it is torture porn with 13 year olds. I mean the story is supposed to show the dangers of child predators, I could see the child predators they are targeting watching this and keeping it in their collection. the end of the film has absolutely no redeeming value and also makes no thematic sense. A sadist person will film 20 minutes of torture/death implicating his crime and then leave it in a garbage can to be found? Wouldn't he keep it? Also watching the rape of a 13 year old on screen can never be socially redeeming. The movie could have gone so many different ways and still shown the dangers of online predators. At least catch the bastard. In fact just in general I am so darn sick of all these so called horror films where evil,the bad guy wins. You know it's almost unheard of for anyone to actually survive one of these things anymore. So depressing, good is suppose to triumph over evil, but I digress.

In this film we are treated to showing how cruel and shallow and reckless today's youth are and also how internet connected they are. We can see the abduction coming from miles away. And all it does is put a more sadistic slant to the friday the 13'th movies of the 80's. The slutty girl dies.(but now she's tortured first). Also another lesson the film teaches, don't be friends with the slutty girl or you might get tortured too. No I'm sorry but this film is exploitation masking as an education film plain and simple. The parents are played as overbearing or dummies. The kids as snobs. You know in the 70's when a film was exploitation. people raged against it but we knew what it was. No one saw deathwish, or I spit on your grave and thought it was educational. Those films at least had consequences for the atrocities they showed to us on screen. This just shows them and says. oh well it's not really exploitation it's graphic to educate you. Yea Ok.

I am writing this review because I could not watch most of the ending (fast-forwarded through the final 20 minutes) and then was shocked that there was no ""conclusion"" (e.g. no one arrested & prosecuted, etc.) so I decided to investigate online to see what happened.  I was ENORMOUSLY RELIEVED to discover that the terrifying scenes were ""dramatized"" re-enactments based on some real-life stories, but it was not actual footage from a girl's video camera.  I don't know how many stars to rate this: it was very believable to me, yet I cannot recommend watching it: just too vivid & horrifying.  I generally like crime dramas, but when the video camera is in the hand of the predator (or the story is told from his point of view) I cannot tolerate it.",1324252800,,1203,4.682464454976303

4425734,2,B004LXBKEC,"This is one of those movies where the claim what is being shown is reenacted footage and events police found after a kidnapping suspected murder investigation. Yes, it's another Blair Witch style movie. Only this one is not about a myth or supernatural being, it's closer to real life this time around. Megan's friend Amy starts talking to a guy online who doesn't have a webcam, but is claiming he is 13 years old or so, they same age these girls are, and of coarse he is chatting them up to meet them. However when Megan goes to meet him, something goes wrong and Megan goes missing, then things follow suit with Amy. Later in the movie they find Amy's video camera that she had been making video diaries on, and it contains footage filmed by their kidnapper.

Personally, I didn't find the movie all that disturbing, but I can see why people would and will. It may sound like I have given spoilers to the movie so far, but believe me I haven't. It's when you find out what the kidnappers intentions for the girls are, and then what happens later at the end of the film that will make some people feel a little unnerved, especially parents who do not monitor what their kids are doing online.

However, what I will say about this movie, the first half is a complete snore fest. Obnoxious stupid teens being as irritating as possible. They are only 12 to 14 years old and attending parties full of sex, drugs and god awful trance music. The kid who is hosting this party is a character you just want to grab by the neck and smack him around for a while to burst the ugly little mogwais ego, or turn HIM over to the kidnapper himself. These scenes I guess where put in to show that these kids where able to go and do what they wanted, but I don't think any of it was needed for the movie itself. Do yourself a favor, and skip it. It's just pointless dribble to show Amy is younger, not as popular and gets sick at parties, shes a goodie-two-shoes... trust me, you won't miss a thing. Skip to the end, Megan gets kidnapped, then it gets boring again, then Amy gets kidnapped, and blah blah, then you see the 22 minutes found on the camera.

As I said, it may disturb some, but it annoyed me for the first half of the movie, the character development had a few things not needed to be known, and then the movie gets more interesting in the final 40 minutes or so. However, if you didn't like Blair Witch, The Last Broadcast or those kind of films, then don't bother with this, if you did, then you may enjoy it. However, keep in mind, it's another movie that says these things happened, and although I don't doubt this sort of thing could happen, the footage you see here is in no way at all a reenactment of anything found.",1321747200,3,2722,4.322896281800391
4425735,1,B004LXBKEC,"Apologies, this review has spoilers.

If you want to watch a jittery horror-porn movie with young actors, this is a good choice. If you want to watch a decent film about the dangers of internet predators and teenagers, go watch the movie Trust or a documentary or something.

Megan is Missing comes off as a fetish film barely disguised as a gritty PSA-type movie. Kids nowadays definitely do the things in this film: they do drugs, they discuss and engage in unsafe sexual activity. What the film does is zoom in all the way on it, rendering these kids down to molestation-victim-turned-party-girl and innocent-girl caricatures. There really is no need for a 14 year old to be giving a graphic description of being orally raped at the age of 10 to her 13 year old friend, there are many other ways of communicating that info. Instead the film makers decide not only to describe it, but to show a bj, then go on to show an off-screen rape where we get to look at the screaming teen's face for a few minutes. Really questionable filmmaking and writing choices here.

The film has almost no value as a PSA anyhow. While the first victim does fall prey to an older, experienced predator, the second one behaves completely out of character and the parents evaporate completely from the plot. You can't convince me that this 13 year old innocent child who still sleeps with stuffed animals is not going to tell her parents that her abducted best friend was talking to a man who is currently harassing her online. Or tell the police. Or aid them at all in any way she can. And most internet predators are probably not pedophile serial killers who are going to subject you to bondage scenarios in a dungeon and bury you alive with your best friends corpse. It's turning a real threat to inexperienced kids, rape and kidnapping, into an unnecessarily ridiculous horror movie plot.

Again, if you want to watch a film with your kids that goes into the subject a tad more realistically, watch Trust. Otherwise you're in for an hour 25 mins of stilted acting, awkward dialogue, and softcore fetish porn.",1320624000,,2092,4.661246612466124
4425736,4,B004LXBKEC,"What I find most disturbing about Megan is Missing is the apparently lack of cognitive ability in the audience to discern fiction (not true, made up story) from non-fiction (based on a true story with factual references) or the new category of faction (a work of fiction created to look like a true story, which this movie is). Folks, snuff films are illegal in the US of A; the participation, transportation, sell and possession of snuff films is illegal. If this were a snuff film Amazon certainly wouldn't be selling it. The interesting fact about this film is that so many people have such violent, emotional responses after seeing it, claiming that it was too much to see (and so on). The filmmakers obviously did well enough of a job. I liked it. I've known quite a few adult women with the same sheeplike traits as the girls in this movie; those traits come from somewhere, possibly their own teen years. Accept it, we live in an uncivilized, brutal world. Every aspect of the human condition is violent that's why we have security measures, laws, cops and military. Man is the most violent predator on the planet, which is how we got to the top of the food chain. Wealth, sex, war and food are all competed for in the human condition. The moment you forget that is the moment you open yourself up to victimhood.
Okay, enough philosophizing; let's look at Megan is Missing: both Amber Perkins and Rachel Quinn (who are both still alive and working on other projects, check IMDb) were very good at portraying the crude, semi-educated American female of the 21st Century; the drug culture, though a bit dramatic on the reality side, was harsh and brutal, and even included the creepy dregs of male society that rely heavily on drugs to get laid. Graphic depiction? Not really; this movie has a meta moment in which the vapid media re-inact Megan's abduction, revealing the level of reality of the movie itself...a re-inactment. There was even an actress mimicking Nancy Grace's loony, cliche overacting.
Out of all the ""found footage"" movies this one isn't all that bad; no more or less than the Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, REC, Paranormal Activity and Paranormal Entity. I prefer a narrative, cinematic film to found footage, but it's all good.
The great grandaddy of found footage would be the 1939 radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds, in which people believed the story so well that they actually panicked and fled cities (blame it on sound effects and the mind's ability to elaborate on spoken...and, today,on visual...information).
Returning to my original statement: it's only a movie. Anything more perceived than that comes from what we writers call the Imagination.

My daughter isn't allowed to go to partys or out on group dates yet, I think she is to young, after watching this she is lucky I will let her go to school.

I loved the first 90% of the movie. Megan and Amy are best friends. Megan is a damaged party girl and Amy is a naive sheltered girl. The first part of the movie sets up how damaged Megan is without losing sympathy of the character. One of best scenes is when Megan confesses how her she was abused by her stepfather.

Megan and later Amy are abducted by ""Josh"" who they "",met"" online and thought was just a teenage boy.

If the movie kept on that vibe and just kept the ending ambiguous, sort of like Blair Witch I would have given it a 4-5 star rating. But no...

The last 10% of the movie is just a bunch of gratuitous violence and torture. Why the director needed to show exactly what happens is beyond me. Why not allow the viewer to guess what happened to the girls? It would have been a lot more scarier.

As it is with the torture porn ending we are left with a movie that is just another Eli Roth clone.

4425739,3,B004LXBKEC,"Let me begin by saying that this a well scripted, well acted, well written, well directed and excellent movie.  However, let me continue to say that this was one of the most disturbing things I have ever witnessed on my 32"" HD television screen and I wish it were just a little blurrier.

This movie is not excessively gory like the Hills Have Eyes or any other slasher on the market, it's not even as gory as Paranormal Activity and it's not overly profane like Reservoir Dogs or even Shrek, there's no nudity and there's no visualization of any dismemberment or otherwise. But this movie truly hits a nerve as you watch it, not because of any unnecessary violence or even the rape scene itself.  For some reason watching it happen to a 21 year old on the big screen can be art and brilliance, but watching it happen to a 13 year old...I don't know, they may only show the face but the expression on her face..., but it gets you and hits you hard in your bodies deepest, most primal instincts of protecting those you care for.  The characters are well done enough that they seem real to you as you watch the movie, even if the antics of Megan's friends are way over the top of any barely teenage girl I've ever met.  Watching it, I know they created girl's characters to fit two completely different social extremes to show that these same circumstances can happen to anyone and everyone, whether you're the popular, smart student, the class slut, the good-one, or even the misfit. (They may be only two characters but they had four personalities). I think the worst part about the whole experience is you KNOW some similar circumstances have happened before on a daily basis and they'll probably happen again, and again, and again, and again. For these reasons listed above I would give the movie 5-stars.

HOWEVER,

The last 22 minutes are way to overdone, and nothing is done to give the viewer any sort of alternative or recommendation.  I get why they did it, driving the point home, but it's simply unnecessary and cruel.  And my least favorite part is the way they seem to paint the Internet as this inherent evil that plagues all those who use it to communicate.  I think technology can be as much a beautiful thing as it is a grotesque one. Information is power, fear is the theft of assumed power, but teaching is the gaining of true power.  All this movie does is steal that assumed power away, but not provide the resources to gain that true power back.  For these reasons I give the movie one star.

So as I cannot do either 5-stars or 1-star I will settle in the middle for 3, while this movie is excellent in all aspects it ultimately just leaves the viewer frightened of the world around them rather than informed of the truth that they can possess about it.",1319414400,26,2775,4.50398406374502
4425740,4,B004LXBKEC,"Read the reviews for this film and you will be met with such headlines as ""Required Viewing for All Parents and Their Daughters"" or ""Every Parent of a Teen Needs to Watch This"" film.  These reviews then talk about how, while deeply disturbing and vile, Megan Is Missing is a necessary evil that needs to be endured in order to teach teenagers the importance of Internet safety.  To some extent I have to agree.  But at the same time, I cannot and do not entirely agree with the fact that MIM is a definitive required viewing.  At least not for every teenager.

Imagine the following scenario.  12-year-old Lisa runs downstairs early Christmas morning, excited as ever to open up her gifts.  She quickly rummages through the lot of gifts, keeping her eye on that certain rectangular one  under the tree she will most certainly safe for last.  It's a gift she has a good feeling about.  Something she has been requesting since her tenth birthday party.  Alas, the time comes in which she gets hold of that fantastic rectangular box.  Little Lisa can barely hold in her excitement as she tears open the polar bear gift wrapping.  And there it is!  What she expected.  She can barely hold in her excitement as she holds up her new gift for her proud father to take pictures of with his new Nikon.  It's a new iMac laptop!

Lisa's father smiles at his daughter, pats her on her head, then tells her, ""Before you play with this, I need you to go through your Christmas stocking.""  Lisa can't begin to imagine what could possibly top her new gift.  After all, what kind of present in a stocking could be better than an iMac?!  But her father insists and so she reaches inside the red felt sock.  She pulls out a DVD.  Bewildered, she reads the title out loud, ""Megan is Missing.""  Confused, she asks,  ""Is this the new Justin Bieber album on DVD?""

Her father smiles.  ""No, honey,"" he says. ""That is a movie you are going to have to watch if you want to keep your iMac.""

Lisa slumps over, the bemused little 12-year-old not sure of what her father means.

The point I am trying to make with this little vignette of mine is the fact that not every teenager needs to, or should for that matter, watch MIM.  It's a very disturbing, vile film that will haunt and affect even the most avid horror fan.  But that is probably because this film, while not actually real, is executed so viscerally and intense that after viewing it, one is left feeling drained and emotionally disturbed.  This isn't a film for horror fans.  It's actually too much for them even.  Instead, this is a film that should be reserved for those teenagers (male or female!) who are beginning to show signs of abusing their Internet privileges (i.e., staying up late, chatting on their computers.

Parents need to talk to their kids about Internet safety.  They need to educate them about what kind of people they are really talking to when they stay up past 3am and find themselves in a Chatroom.  Teenagers need to be taught that they shouldn't request or accept anyone on Facebook that they don't actually know.

I don't need to tape a stick of dynamite to my hand and light it on fire to know that taping a stick of dynamite to my hand and lighting it on fire is dangerous.

4425741,1,B004LXBKEC,"This movie was disturbing in a lot of ways.  Whether your average 13-14 year old acts like these girls is up for debate, though I imagine that the story accurately reflects someone's child out there.  The thing that bugs me was the last 20 minutes.  I've heard people suggest that this should be a PSA, that teens and their parents should watch together. I strongly disagree with that.  When I was a teenager I participated in a safety camp as a counselor.  Part of the training involved us watching a movie about things that can happen.  Without going into any kind of graphic detail, the film showed us images of kids that were found dead after going missing (no blood, no close ups, just long shots), anyway my point is that those images stayed with me for years and to this day I remember that.  I can't say whether the director had good intentions or bad, but the last 20 minutes of this movie are way too graphic and unnecessary to make the greater point that parents and children need to be smarter due to the increased sophistication of predators.  There is a fine line when trying to convey a message and I think this film crossed it.",1318723200,4,1143,4.461538461538462
4425742,2,B004LXBKEC,"THE GOOD: As many other reviews have already mentioned, the message is there. Yes, the acting is hammy. Yes, some of the plot points are ridiculous. (There's a particularly grating plot hole regarding a video camera near the end; I won't spoil it.) But the idea is important. I won't say the movie is suitable for teenagers as a way of reaffirming the ""be safe on the Internet"" message, as they could be put off by either the ending or the terrible acting. But it's good for what it is; it gets the point across, and it does so effectively.

THE BAD: The decision to film everything in a ""found footage"" style is distracting, and takes away from the rest. With other movies (Cloverfield, The Blair Witch Project, REC [NOT Quarantine], etc.), the premise works; it covers a very brief period of time, in a continuous motion (if that makes sense). But Megan Is Missing attempts to cover a longer period of time, using very short snippets of footage. The constant jumps are frustrating, especially when some scenes are only a few minutes before cutting to black. If this were filmed using a wider variety of sources (the way District 9 combined found footage, interviews, and ""normal"" cinematography), I feel like it would have been much more effective.

THE TERRIBLE: Jesus Christ, the last 20 minutes. I understand getting a point across, but depicting it in such a brutal and graphic way is completely unnecessary. I found myself fast-forwarding through most of it. It's not excessively gory, but it is disturbing.

There is one other incredibly frustrating aspect about the movie. Twice in the movie, there are cheap ""shock"" scares. Think those ridiculous screamer videos, where a disturbing images flashes abruptly on screen. Using cheap scares like this detracts from the rest of the movie, on top of ruining the pacing. This movie doesn't feel like a ""traditional"" horror movie at all. There's no reason why these kinds of scares need to be there.

FINAL VERDICT: It's on Netflix right now, so if you have a subscription, might as well watch it. But don't expect mindless entertainment; although it shares many qualities with B-movies, unintentional comedy is not one of them. It's not exactly deep either, as the characters are portrayed in a very cliche way. And the final 20 minutes are a very jarring contrast to the rest of the movie.",1318550400,4,2343,4.82089552238806
4425763,5,B004LXBKEC,"Megan is Missing is a really powerful movie that leaves an indelible impression on the viewer.  It's a strange film, but the final twenty-odd minutes are downright chilling and very, very disturbing.  I knew nothing about this movie going in to it, and for a while I thought the filmmaker was just using the idea of Internet predators in another bid to cash in on the reality-based movie craze (the film consists of ""found footage"" from webcams, cell phones, and videotapes).  Well before the end, though, it was crystal clear that this was not the case.  Megan is Missing is, as they say, as serious as a heart attack - even more serious than that, really, because a heart attack is a natural event.  There is nothing natural about the fates of Megan and her friend Amy in this movie.  The most awful thing about it all is the fact that every incident in this film is based on an actual event - not one single event, but a conglomeration of a number of different child abduction cases.  It is truly horrifying to know that everything that happened to these girls did actually happen to one or more poor children.

The story revolves around two best friends: 14-year-olds Megan (Rachel Quinn) and Amy (Amber Perkins).  The girls could not be more different - Megan is a bit of a wild child who has already experimented with drugs and sex, while Amy is mousy, virginal, and inhibited - but their friendship is very real.  The two talk numerous times each day over cell phones, webcams, and in person.  Amy wishes she could be as uninhibited as Megan, while Megan longs for the stable family life that Amy enjoys.  One of the things Megan likes to do is to chat with boys over the Internet, and it is there that she ""meets"" Josh.  Josh's webcam is conveniently broken, but he certainly seems like a nice guy.  Finding him intriguing, Megan accepts his invitation to meet up behind a local diner - and that's the last anyone sees or hears from her.  In the days following Megan's disappearance, Amy makes a number of video diaries and works up the gumption to contact Josh herself, who tells her that Megan never showed up to meet him.  Then, three weeks after Megan's disappearance - which has since been revealed by the diner's security camera to be an abduction - Amy too disappears.  That is when the movie takes a truly chilling turn.

I would encourage viewers to go to the film's web site and read the statement from Marc Klaas and the message from writer/director Michael Goi about why and how he made this movie.  It was Goi's intention to make this film about Internet predators as realistic as possible - and he definitely succeeded in doing just that.  The conversations and partying activities of Megan and her circle of friends that dominate the first part of the movie may seem shocking (they certainly shocked me), but they are all based on the actual conversations of some of Goi's friends' daughters (who actually allowed Goi to listen in on their conversations).  As for all the young teens cast for the movie, Goi insisted that their parents read the script and be on set during filming.  Most importantly, as I mentioned earlier, all of the bad things that happen in the film are based on actual events taken from a number of true crimes.  The only thing that struck me as unrealistic about this film is the local news stories about Megan's disappearance - they are almost comical at times, especially the ""re-enactment"" of Megan's abduction.  I can only assume that Goi was trying to make some kind of statement about the news coverage of child abduction cases.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend that parents and their teenaged children watch this film together, but I do recommend that both watch this movie - and talk about it together afterwards.  I don't know of a better way to communicate the dangers that Internet predators pose to children.",1318204800,6,3867,4.658321060382916
4425764,1,B004LXBKEC,"As my title suggests, this movie was terrible. The only good thing about it, is now me and my friends have something to make fun of for a little bit. First of all, how are these actresses supposed to be 14? They were at least 17 or 18. Add their terrible acting to the mix and you've got a terrible movie. The director clearly does not know how teenagers truly act, no 14 year old would be doing hard drugs and kissing other girls. Again, that's more 17 or 18 year olds. And for the last 22 minutes, half of it was just either him digging a hole, or filling said hole up. I do not recommend this movie at all.",1317686400,6,609,4.041322314049586
4425765,1,B004LXBKEC,Wow! I was expecting a lot more. Good idea but not very well put together. Very boring and unentertaining. I fast forwarded through most of it. The ending was very disturbing and should have been edited down. It kept dragging on. Good shock value but not done very well. I definately wouldn't recommend it.,1310947200,7,306,4.685185185185185
4425766,2,B004LXBKEC,"After glancing over some of the other reviews of this film, I have to ask myself this question: Was I watching the same film as a lot of these other people? Several reviews mention words and phrases like ""graphic"", ""realistic"", and ""very disturbing"". Perhaps me being a horror fanatic and that I have seen so many horror films, that I've become a bit desensitized. Perhaps its because I have no children of my own that I don't see the true horror for maybe someone that may be a parent and then viewing this film. But whatever the case, those phrases don't really to come to my mind at all after watching this film. First off, the attempt to do a movie using ""web cam"" and camcorder footage for a more realistic movie viewing experience, is getting a bit tired. Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity 1 and 2, Quarantine are some that come right to mind. Not saying those are all bad movies, in fact I like all those films for the most part, but at some point it just gets a bit old. Perhaps the right concept is there. A cautionary tale for today's youth about using the internet for talking to and meeting strangers, etc. But it wasn't done quite effectively. First off, the acting was sub par. Their line delivery is like watching people reading off lines of dialogue (Except for Amy's character in the last 20 minutes, which was quite good). Besides that however, the Megan character is for the most part unappealing in the fact that she is pretty much a dope head wannabe slut that treats most people badly or just uses them (with the exception of Amy). For me, its hard to feel much empathy for a character that's portrayed in that way. Other problems I had were the ""cell phone cameras"" or whatever they were. How were we actually seeing the characters on their cell phones when they were talking to each other? They used the same ""web cam"" effect on the cell phones too? That made no sense to me. Another thing was the ""breaking news reports"" that were shown. They were laughable. Its like the movie was making fun of itself. At that point I couldn't take the movie seriously. The only redeeming quality this film has was the last 20 minutes or so, when you are taken into a dungeon of sorts while the killer is using Amy's camcorder to document his acts. Yeah, the implied rape scene was a bit bothersome I suppose. As well as the revealed fate of Megan. But still yet, the makers of this film managed to mess this up too, with an extra boring and unnecessary extended digging scene that seems to go on forever! The movie itself is just under 90 minutes, so maybe they were just trying to fill up some screen time. But that scene just ruined what little momentum the film had in the last 20 minutes. Overall, the film isn't the worst I've seen, and again, perhaps the concept is there, but it was done fairly poorly. Again, all these reviews calling this movie so graphic and disturbing are, in my opinion, overreacting. I've seen far far more graphic films than this. People have said this is a film that girls or teens should watch to show what could happen. And I suppose if a 13-16 year old that hasn't seen many scary movies were to watch this, it might shake them up a bit. But as for me, I would be more upset at my parents for making me waste almost 90 minutes of my life while I could have been doing something else..perhaps chatting to a new ""friend"" I met online.;)",1310342400,8,3387,4.42948717948718
4425767,5,B004LXBKEC,"As a Mother of four this movie deeply disturbed me. Is this a hard movie to watch, well yes and painful. Not only is it hard to watch poor Megan's life spiral out of control because she was doomed from her life from the get go, well it is hard to see two girls get drawn into an evil they are not aware that awaits them.
The last 20 minutes are beyond disturbing. If this movie disturbs you, well then it has done it's job. I do believe every teen should watch this from ages 13 and up. I also believe this should be shown in schools as a warning to teens. If you think this is to disturbing for them, well then good it should be. Teenagers these days think they are invincible. Parents like to think not my teen, or my kids don't do this.. well neither did Amy in the movie, she just got sucked in.
Though this Movie is fictional based on other cases, it hits home with reality as to the evil that is out there just waiting for our children. If this images burn in your mind, well good, I hope they do. As a parent they should. They should haunt us for the rest of our lives. I want them to burn in our children's minds as well. Then maybe just maybe it can prevent them in becoming victims to evil such as this.  I am giving this 5 stars because of the message it sends. I am also making my daughter watch this tonight.

4425769,1,B004LXBKEC,"Please don't watch this film. It is truly awful and you will not be able to undo having watched it. It will permanently be seared in your mind. It contains very graphic  and long images of a young teenage girl getting raped, thrown in a barrel with her best friend's dead body, and buried alive. If you are at all sensitive about visual imagery (and I'm not) please don't watch this.

I saw the film a while ago at a screening in New York and it was billed as a ""social issue"" movie, basically shedding light on the vulnerability of teenagers on the internet. It is not that. The film just felt like a realistic, graphic, horror movie. I fully understand that it's horrible that kids get kidnapped, raped, and murdered, and that society should work to prevent that. I don't think there's much controversy there, so why the filmmaker billed it this way, I have absolutely no idea. I don't need to see it portrayed this way to understand this issue.

Why Marc Klass of the Klass Kids Foundation is supporting it, I also have no idea. It seems like an awful mismatch and dishonor to his daughter. I came away from this film feeling like yes, there are psychotic people in this world who will do unspeakable things to children, but the film left me with no viable solution for this. It leaves the audience with nothing but fear and overgeneralized mistrust. It is important to be careful on the internet and to teach your children how to stay safe, but having a generalized sense of terror, like this movie creates, is not helpful.

The movie did not leave me feeling empowered in any way. The most effective social films educate or shock the audience with details about an issue and by the end of the film bring the audience to a point of understanding what they can do or change to make the situation better. This movie just brings you down and leaves you there with no solution whatsoever.

If this was purely billed as a shock and awe horror movie, I could write it off as not my thing. Having it billed as a movie shedding light on a social issue was a huge mistake and it is completely ineffective in helping this issue. The choice of shots and imagery feels exploitative. It's rare for me to feel so strongly against a film, but I really think this film failed in it's mission.",1307404800,7,2280,4.458033573141487

I disagree that the last 22 minutes was the worst. Yes, it was awful, shocking, horrible. But realistic and you will understand why I say that after you google it.
