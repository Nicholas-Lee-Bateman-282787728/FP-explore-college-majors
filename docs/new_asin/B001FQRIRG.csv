3588222,5,B001FQRIRG,"My wife and I both fell in love with the series when we first started to watch it on our Canadian satellite dish. I have the first 6 'series' (series is Australian for a season)I bought as they became available from Australia and got the whole region free DVD player etc. I recall when it was shown on our Direct TV on the WE channel, but it was so cut up with commercials and ""edited"" for US TV, we couldn't watch it! Now that the entire show is available at Amazon in region 2, it's a great show that we highly recommend! With this season we thought that they couldn't keep the action going, but they did. Something that US shows can't seem to do to well is bring in new characters, have old ones killed off or leave the show and still keep the show alive. Can't wait for season 8 which was the LAST season and the show is now gone from TV in Australia.",1236124800,,855,4.125748502994012

3588224,5,B001FQRIRG,"I have watched every season of McLeod's Daughters and Season 7 was not disappointing, although, too many character changes. But I'll stay faithfully watching through Season 8 hoping things end without too much drama of the heart.",1233964800,,229,5.216216216216216

3588226,5,B001FQRIRG,"I can't tell you how happy I was when Amazon started selling the Mcleod series.  I am completely addicted and HOPE they sell the last season.  Season 7 is very good but not as great as 1-5.  It has its great episodes and its bad ones, but I would still hightly recommend this.",1231286400,6,276,4.169811320754717
3588227,5,B001FQRIRG,"I purchased this latest season of McLeod's Daughters as a gift. This is not a well known series in America, rather it is an Australian made series.  My friend used to watch this on one of the cable channels here until it was canceled in the USA. I located seasons 1-6 on eBay for a steal and then this Christmas I found season 7 right when it went on sale on Amazon. If you are looking for a new epic series that will keep you entertained, this may be one to take a look at.  My friend swears by it, and she has gotten a few of her friends hooked on it as well.",1231113600,8,561,3.912280701754386
3588228,5,B001FQRIRG,"This is a great show with interesting characters and storylines. It is addicting, I have all 7 seasons.

3588248,5,B001FQRIRG,"One of my favorite TV series!  They picked a good time to end the series tho, as many of the original characters have died or left one way or the other.  Was starting to stray from what I loved about the beginning seasons.",1394582400,,222,4.1395348837209305

3588251,5,B001FQRIRG,"I found McLeod's daughters on an obscure cable channel many years ago.  When it stopped airing, I had to find out how the ongoing story was unfolding, so I set about buying the entire series.  Yes, it is a ""soap"" but has characters you wind up caring about.  And the setting in Australia is stunning.",1371168000,,300,4.418181818181818

3588255,5,B001FQRIRG,"I chose this rating because thru Netflix I have enjoyed all 8 seasons of the series ""McLeod's Daughters"". I have now purchased the enitre series for my home library. This is beautifully filmed in South Austrailia and the stories always have something in them to keep you coming back for more...",1358640000,,294,4.784313725490196
3588256,5,B001FQRIRG,"This whole TV series is great.  I had never heard of it until I saw it advertised in a brochure that came with a Heartland DVD I had ordered.  It is an Australian series that ran for 8 season, about women/sisters running a cattle/sheep ranch in Australia in modern times.  Of course the ranch next door is owned by a rich landowner that has two sons that are constantly involved with the women.  I will warn you up front the show can be very emotional.  Wait till you get to the end of season two and you will understand why I said that.  Over the length of the series, there are changes to the main characters as they come and go for different reasons.  However the series ties it all together very well.  I am not quite sure who the prime audience for this show is.  In Australia it was extremely popular with the women.  I suggest you do like I do, when first trying out a new series, and just order season 1 at first.  If you like season one as much as I did, you will be hooked, and then end up ordering all the other seasons.  Just one comment, don't just watch the first episode before making a decision.  Give the show a chance and watch at least the first half dozen or so episodes, if not the entire first season, before making up your mind.",1354838400,,1251,4.184100418410042

3588258,5,B001FQRIRG,If you want a movie that warms your heart then I strongly suggest you watch each and every season of Mcleods Daughters.

3588262,3,B001FQRIRG,"I have been a fan of McLeod's ever since it showed on WE several years ago and watched it religiously there until it was cancelled, then began collecting each season as it was released.  This season and the next (and final) one are neither one as good as the seasons before them, but definitely worth watching to help wrap up a complete McLeod's Daughters experience.",1252368000,4,367,4.6461538461538465
3588263,5,B001FQRIRG,The people in these movies are awsome actors and actresses.  I have come to want to be them and get so caught up in their lives I can't wait for the next.  You must see this and enjoy what you have.,1238025600,,198,3.8048780487804876
3588264,5,B001FQRIRG,"I got hooked on this series when it was on cable in the US.  It didn't start until 11pm, but it was worth being tired at work the next day.  I have purchased all 7 seasons so far and have not been dissappointed in any of them.  I do think the seasons 4-6 were the best, but all were very good.  I would recommend to most anyone, my husband is even hooked on it and I loan out my seasons one by one to my friends.",1237075200,,412,3.755813953488372
