4513624,5,B00508W3M0,"I saw this movie over 45 years ago and it made a lasting impression.
It is one of those funny feel-good movies that stick with you.
I love Glenn Ford and I love this movie.",1357430400,,172,3.942857142857143
4513625,5,B00508W3M0,"Here is a movie that's fun to watch based on actions during civil war that really bears little toward the history of that war? But for entertainment it's a great comedy with great acting by a hollywood legend! Glenn Ford provides the acting the script is so so but all in all not a bad movie! Amazon provides me the ability to continue my hobby that of collecting great movies at a reasonable price!

4513626,3,B00508W3M0,"Short and sweet. If you are an F troop fan or you need some bellylaughs because real life is now so challenging buy this movie. Great stars in this comedy. Glen Ford,Melvin Douglas,Stella Stevens,Andrew Prine,and Mr. Mcgoo himself Jim Backus as the commanding General.",1351987200,,268,5.113636363636363
4513627,3,B00508W3M0,"Suspend your need (if you have one) for a plot that is realistic in the way people actually behave.  If you do that, and enjoy watching these actors, who I enjoy.  This can be an amusing and funny movie to watch.  This is an old movie that I wanted to see again, and after some searching on the internet and other services, I found it on Amazon.",1342483200,,345,4.119402985074627
4513628,5,B00508W3M0,"I saw this movie many years ago and bought the soundtrack.  Unfortunately, it was on vinyl and is not available on CD.  I wondered if I could order the movie and turned to Amazon first!  There it was in DVD!  My husband and I watched it right away and laughed right through it!  It's a great ""feel-good"" movie that's pure ""escape-ism"" from the daily grind!  Enjoy!",1341273600,,364,4.4393939393939394
4513629,3,B00508W3M0,"A favorite movie of mine arrived from Amazon yesterday. At the top of DVD case with a bright red background, it proclaimed, ""Remastered Edition"". As I said, the movie itself is great. But the quality of the DVD with MANY white spots (the ""digital remastering"") is very poor. So, if you want this DVD right now, Amazon's poor quality transfer DVD is the only game in town. If you don't mind waiting, you might want to write the studio (Warner) and have them release an official, truly digitally remastered DVD. Also, Amazon doesn't give you a break for poor quality; their spotty DVD is full price.",1340841600,14,597,4.6415094339622645
4513630,4,B00508W3M0,"Actually, I heard the soundtrack album (TODAY, by the New Christy Minstrels)  quite a while before I ever saw the movie.  Not very surprisingly, I loved the movie, too.  With a cast that included Glenn Ford,  Joan Blondell, and all the other talented actors, how could you go wrong?  The plot was good, and didn't  cause the old I've-seen-this-before feeling that a lot of comedies do.  Enjoyed every minute of it.  My only quibble with it (and the reason it didn't get five stars)  is that for some inexplicable reason it was filmed in black-and-white.  It would have been fantastic in color.  But don't let that stop you from seeing it---I just ordered a copy anyway, and will be watching it again.",1337904000,2,700,4.655737704918033
4513631,4,B00508W3M0,"I saw the movie in the theater when it came out. I always had good memories about it. I ran into my vinal copy of ""Today"", which is the ""soundtrack"" of the movie, and wanted to see it again. The only downer to the movie was that there were only ""teasers"" of the songs.. the album is still necessary as a companion",1317254400,,313,4.064516129032258
4513632,5,B00508W3M0,"Advance to the Rear has always been one of my favorite comedies. Melvyn Douglas and Glen Ford are a hoot together. Stella Stevens is at her eye-candy best. If you liked Hallelujah Trail and F-Troop, you'll love Advance to the Rear!",1316476800,6,231,4.658536585365853

4513639,4,B00508W3M0,"Its the summer of 1862, and Col. Claude Brackenby (Melvyn Douglas), a 25-year veteran Regular Cavalry officer, has been for the last five months in command of the Fifth New York Volunteers, which is infantry and therefore a comedown.  But Brackenby has reached a sort of accommodation with the enemy.  We have a nice well-regulated sector here, he explains to his second-in-command, former attorney Capt. Jared Heath (Glenn Ford).  Every morning at six oclock the Rebs fire thirty rounds of artillery at us, and every morning at six-thirty we fire thirty rounds back at them...Keeps their generals happy, and our generals happy.  But when they're suddenly ordered to advance, the whole situation goes to hell.  As Pvt. Owen Selous (Andrew Prine) later explains it at the court-martial, [We] were movin up...when suddenly I see Colonel Brackenby on his horse hell-bent for the rear!

The court-martial, impressed (or perhaps that should be dismayed) by the number of misfits in Brackenbys outfit, decides to fill it out with misfits from other outfits, reduce Brackenby and Heath in rank (to captain and lieutenant), and send the whole lot out to Indian Territory to relieve the 11th Cavalry, which, being a good outfit, will be far more useful and efficient on the front.  But when the word of this decision reaches Confederate headquarters, its misinterpreted, and Brackenbys is described as being made up of picked men.  So the South decides to send a spy, Martha Lou Williams (Stella Stevens), to find out just what Company Q is up to.  Theres a great shipment of gold from the Western mines hanging fire; perhaps they're going to escort it.  And it happens that somewhere in the vicinity of their goal theres a renegade named Zattig (James Griffith) operatinghe says hes for the Confederacy, but were not quite sure.  Zattig in turn is on good terms with Thin Elk (Michael Pate), the leader of the local Indians, who happens to have entered West Point only two years after Brackenby.  Meanwhile, the river steamer on which Company Q is to head upriver proves to also be the transport of choice for Easy Jenny (Joan Blondell), a former client of Heaths, and her girls, whove just been run out of town by the decent women.  Now all the players are in place, and the real confusion begins.

It would be impossible to describe all the ins and outs of Company Qs experiences, but suffice it to say that all of them, from next champion of the world Pvt. Fergus Slasher OToole (J. Lewis Smith) to Cpl. Silas Geary (Jesse Pearson), whom horses delight in following, prove their worth, and Heath and Martha Lou fall in love.  This creatively scripted comedy-Western (the story treatment was penned by Western great Jack Schaefer from a novel by William Chamberlain) was for years one of my favoritesI must have watched it on TV half a dozen timesand I was happy to see that it remains just as enjoyable on DVD.",1436313600,,2905,4.816901408450704
4513640,3,B00508W3M0,"This is a movie I saw years ago when the Christy Minstrels were still new and going strong.  I bought it mostly for nostalgia reasons, but it is a fun movie and kid friendly.",1434585600,,174,4.117647058823529
4513641,5,B00508W3M0,"Advance To The Rear was released in 1964. I saw it in the theatre. A civil war comedy, it is pretty funny. Joan Blondell was wonderful as always.",1434412800,,145,4.214285714285714
4513642,2,B00508W3M0,"when this movie came out it was funny.  Has a good cast. Music is great but you need to get the sound track, the movie does not have as much music.  Probably not the career pinnacle for Glenn Ford.  Times change. Does fill a rainy afternoon with nothing to do",1432944000,,259,4.14
4513643,4,B00508W3M0,"The movie is a nice comedy worth watching. Remember seeing it when I was a kid which is why I wanted a copy. Glenn Ford is as always top notch. The movie is in black and white which is not a problem, but I found the copy to be a little dark. By dark I mean the copy was not as bright as it should be. I suppose that is because it has been remastered. Other than that I enjoyed it very much. It is very similar to the old TV show F-Troop. If you enjoyed the TV show you will like Advance To The Rear.",1431907200,,499,3.7169811320754715
4513644,4,B00508W3M0,Somewhat dated and slower moving than comidies of this sort do today.  Too slow for my wife.,1431043200,,92,4.411764705882353

4513647,1,B00508W3M0,"Big disappointment. I had the sound track album by the New Christy Minstrels, originally on an LP and now in a digital version and enjoyed it for years, but never did see the movie and couldn't find it on VHS or DVD and didn't even see it listed for a late night movie. After seeing the download (technically very good quality) I realized why I had so much trouble finding it. Despite a stellar cast, the plot is totally ridiculous and unbelievable. I'm a southerner with a northern mother and other relatives, but I was offended by the portrayal of both the north and the south in the Civil War. The sound track that I loved is only a minor part of the story with almost no actual singing. Buy the New Christy Minstrels album, not the movie.",1425945600,,742,4.384057971014493
4513648,3,B00508W3M0,"I saw this movie when I was a kid and remember laughing historically.  It wasn't quite as funny 40 years later, but it was still quite enjoyable.",1421712000,,145,4.37037037037037
4513649,5,B00508W3M0,One of the best of these type of western comedies such as Paint Your Wagon and Hallelujah Trail ...though not as extravagant,1419811200,,124,4.681818181818182

4513654,5,B00508W3M0,"remember seeing this movie when it first came out in 64-it also spawned the seies F-troop. the book the movies based on company of cowards is more serious. I watch it when ever its on, though I wish they'd colorize it. I still have the soundtrack LP from the movie by the Christy Minsterals. its always a hoot to watch Michael Pate play indians in the 60s westerns.(hes australian).",1409616000,,382,4.550724637681159

4513657,2,B00508W3M0,"I enjoyed this movie. It was not great, but quite fun and I will watch it again and recommend it to others. Glenn Ford is fun. In some ways his character reminded me of Col. Hogan in Hogan's Heroes.",1393200000,,198,4.102564102564102

8450950,4,B00508W3M0,"Classic slapstick and clever dialogue make this forgotten film a one-of-a-kind Civil War comedy. Glenn Ford and Stella Stevens do some of their best comedic work in a film that runs out of gas at the end, but is still worth a look.
