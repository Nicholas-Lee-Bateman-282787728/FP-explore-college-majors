3017575,5,B000Y9MTBK,"Korean cinema has a way of coming up with original stories told in visceral ways with inventive plots and stupendous acting and this is no exception. Director  and writer Ki-Duk Kim (The Coast Guard and 3 Iron, to name but two) sets his latest film in the world of loan sharks and these guys make the pay day loan companies look like philanthropists by comparison. Jung-Jin Lee plays Gang-Do a ruthless enforcer who helps a shady loan company lend money to poor business people and force them to sign personal injury insurance documents. Once they have their money they then ramp up the interest payments so that a 3,000 loan becomes 30, 000 in one month.

Then he arrives and when they cant pay, he works out how to maim them to get the money they are owed from the insurance company. This is really brutal and involves a manner of nasty tortures. Then one day a woman turns up at his door, she asks for forgiveness for abandoning him as a child and now wants to be a real mother to him. He does not believe her and sets her some cruel tests in order for her to convince him that she really is his mother. What then unfolds is a story of loss, redemption, deception, revenge and love.

This was South Koreas entry for the 85th Academy awards and many feel it is a masterpiece. It is filmed on locations that make it look like some sort of Stalinist failure theme park, with the scenery as bleak as the plot unfolding on the screen. The acting is magnificent and will have you feeling repulsed and attracted often in the same scene. There is a fair amount of seeming animal butchery too as he likes his food as fresh as you can get it and has a wide almost Catholic taste in food so long as it is meat and has just been hacked to death.

This is a stunningly original piece of cinema and it stayed with me for days and I found compelled to tell my friends about it almost as a way of exorcising it from my mind- which is a very good thing indeed. This is not for the squeamish and whilst a million miles away from being a feel good film it will make you think and also realise the redemptive power in familial love. One of the best films so far this year I can absolutely recommend 100%.",1381536000,3,2187,4.2626506024096384

Not sure if this film was meant to have some allegorical elements but it nevertheless provokes thoughts about the meaning of family; the value of a human being and how monied interests help define both.

3017580,4,B000Y9MTBK,"Kim Ki-duk's latest movie ""Pieta"" - the title evoking the image of a grieving mother and her dead son - is nothing conventional. You may call it a psychological thriller, a character study, or the director's candid outlook on capitalism. You may like it or hate it for the film's honest brutality and violence. Whatever your reaction may be, ""Pieta"" is a compelling drama with lots of tense moments.

""Pieta"" is about Gang-Do, (Jeong-jin Lee) a cold-hearted debt collector for a loan shark in the city of Seoul. If his clients don't pay up (and most of them just cannot), Gang-do cripples them on the spot, taking the insurance money later. He shows no mercy because he has none to give.

One day, Gang-Do meets a mysterious woman Mi-Son (Jeong-jin Lee). The sad-looking woman claims that she is his mother who abandoned him about 30 years ago. Gang-Do spurns her, but she keeps coming back to him. Strong performances from the two leads make this unique story even more compelling.

The film's story is largely set in the industrial area of Seoul. The debtors are often owners of small-scale factories whose business is not clearly doing well. The narrow streets and bleak landscapes are effectively captured, reflecting the hard and desolate life ahead of them.

""Pieta"" has its own way of presenting the world, the way that is often shocking and off-putting, but never boring. Its world is populated with people doomed from the beginning, but the film is fascinating all the more for that.",1375315200,4,1492,4.8392156862745095

But if you are looking for one that will invite you to ask questions of life such as forgiveness, family, sin and evil, redemption, and justice, this movie will provide you with a lot of issues to think about. No simple answers, though.  It is disturbing, but very thoughtfully made.",1375142400,2,464,4.3604651162790695
3017582,5,B000Y9MTBK,"I have seen the majority of Kim Ki-Duk's films. He was one of the South Korean directors that first got me into the ""Korean New Wave"" some years ago. There is something to be said for his works, and no one could argue that his stories are creative, if not original. His films such as ""Bad Guy"", ""3-Iron"", ""The Isle"", ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Spring"", ""Samaritan Girl"" and ""The Bow"" had characters that barely talked, immersed in symbolism and the emotions were expressed through action that spoke a lot for its intended narrative. Kim's films are different and he proved me it once more with ""Dream"" and ""Time"", albeit I was a little disappointed with ""Breathless"" and his experimental film ""Real Fiction"".

Winner of the top prize of several film festivals such as the ""Golden Lion"" award in Venice, as well as being the first Korean movie to win top honors in Vienna, Cannes and Berlin. ""Pieta"" is Kim's 18th feature that he directed as well as written. Once again proving that he has the determination to be different even when he does something a little more standard, Kim's ""Pieta"" is about a young man named Lee Kang-Do (played by Lee Jung-ji). Kang-Do is a heartless man who has no known family or friends and whose job is to threaten his clients' debtors that requires 10x the amount of the loan. Kang-Do's existence is the kind that he only exists to do a job, and collects the interest through insurance after he had crippled the debtor. One day, a woman (Cho Min-Su) pays him a visit and she claims to be his long-lost mother. Kang-Do denies such a possibility, and she relentlessly shadows him, and soon, he is moved by the display of motherly love expressed by this woman. Now, Kang-Do's past are set to collide tragically with his future...

The magic of Kim's films is just how he manages to express harsh reality or a way of life or emotion through the use of his screenplay. His screenplays are often rich with symbolism, that beautifully combines with violence and unnerving themes. He gave us a glimpse of the red light district, a twisted view of beauty, the cheating wife, atonement for sins and even how our dreams make us understand more and yet, see less. ""Pieta"" is rich with religious symbolism and highly sexual images may cause a lot of viewers to have rather mixed reactions. To appreciate the need for such elements in its narrative, one would have to accept that such things are highly plausible and that humanity has the capacity for such depravity. I mean, Kim had pushed the limits before, and ""Pieta"" does have a few scenes that had provoked a lot of controversy. In my opinion, such things are needed to advance the plot and for the viewer to further feel the emotions of its characters.

""Pieta"" is a highly tragic film. It is the kind of film that the less you know, the better and yet it would undoubtedly be more for the esoteric few used to Kim's many twists and turns in his writing. There are strong existential overtones and powerful themes of ""Karma"" (you reap what you sow) as Kim tries to show his viewers that such actions often have a consequence. It is a film about the many emotions that arise because of money; fury, greed, revenge, love and the feeling of a loss. It is different and very shocking, and the more you become immersed and invested with its characters then the more the power of its narrative would be. It is a twisted relationship that builds on one heartless man and a mysterious woman. The development of their relationship is one that is believable as both of them seemingly wants to 'feel' and atone, and the careful methodology that Kim uses in his screenplay is just fantastic. Once you think that you had it figured it out, then one realizes that there is more to it than you first thought. Kim immerses his viewers with such careful manipulation that one could easily feel its shocking tragic turns.

What always made his films different and bold is the manner that he handles the chemistry between his protagonists. Kim's writing brings characters that feel like real people, that how they interact with their world become very natural. He envelopes them with a certain amount of darkness while they struggle to find some light. Always nearly and sometimes achieving and yet, something remains beyond their grasp. Kim also knows how to pick his performers as Lee Jung-Ji and Jo Min-Su were able to come into the needed dramatic power in each scene. There is no doubt that Cho Min-Su stole the show, her eyes, her actions, and the way she spoke carried an enigma that aided in the film's powerful writing and steady pace. Lee Jung-Ji sold the role of the heartless enforcer, that once could see and feel his development from ruthlessness into someone who cares. Kang Eun-Jin also made such a powerful impression as the wife of a man who had been crippled. Despite her limited screen time, she was fantastic and her role added a lot to the flow of emotions.

As with most of his films, Kim uses a cinematography that borders on minimalism and yet the shots come from an angle that almost simulates the feel of a fly on the wall, a `passing' glance and of voyeurism. Close ups and wide shots are abundant, while some scenes were almost shot to mimic the view of the other character. Colors were a little subdued to give perhaps give the film a more depressing feel. This is a film where action and atmosphere played a lot in its narrative, Kim uses everything to dictate the way the viewer saw his sequences. Kim had definitely matured as a filmmaker and as a storyteller, one could easily see that he had improved his craft.

Kim Ki-Duk had done it once more, and surely this is a film that may be one of the best ones I've seen in 2013. It is magnificently paced and edited, with excellent performances that those two things alone surpassed all my expectations. Kim also presents several twists and turns, while not totally surprising, they were brought in with such an impeccable stroke that it made me feel for the characters' own tragic lives. The ending is one that defined everything that the characters had brought to bear, and maybe it is indeed all about they have wrought. Darkness is often the absence of light, and once it had been illuminated, it is always darkest before its dawn. It is a cycle that Kim had presented, and one that he allows his audience to see into with their own ways. It is a disturbing, and yet beautifully honest film. Highly Recommended.

3017583,4,B000Y9MTBK,"Pieta, at first watch, is both malicious and discomforting both in plot and in aesthetics. The mood is a constant state of depravity and joylessness, encompassed in a dark and impoverished setting. However, immediately upon completion, you can feel the dark humanistic reality of the film begin to settle within you.

As the final scene fades, the screen remains black for quite a while as the music escalates, and an uneasiness crawls over you as you come to realize that this film is much more than a one-dimensional dark and twisted film. It has existential meaning and passion that resonates with the things we define our lives by: ""Love, honor, violence, fury, hatred, jealousy, revenge, death."" Labeling the film as either morally depraved or morally passionate is a matter one's experience of the film, which is astounding despite its resonating misery. This is one film in which you won't smile a single time, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.",1365811200,10,957,4.98125

I was prepared for the brutality and general horror. However I was not prepared for the many layered psychological impact of the script and the abilities of the actors to portray their feeling, or in the case of the protagonist to appear so very cold and uncaring for the first half of the film. As he goes about his work as a loan collector his expression never changes even as he cripples people to the extent they become handicapped and can never work again. The setting is the terrifying industrial slum of Cheonggyecheon, jam-packed with small, cramped machine shops where utter poverty reigns. Though at least one character mourns its imminent transformation through urban renewal, its filmed as a place out of hell, where people are so destitute they are willing to barter their arms and legs for money. A woman claiming to be his mother eventually changes his perception of the world. Basically this film shows that love can make all the difference in a life. But of course don't expect it to end there, the denouement is at heart a redemption story with a twist.
It is difficult to say I Liked this film, but unlike so many throw away movies, this one will make you think. It is not pretty or attractive in any way, but it is a movie I will never forget.",1407888000,,1412,4.562992125984252

All I can say is that if you are already a fan of Kim Ki-Duk's directing and films, then this movie will not disappoint you at all.  The matter-of-fact quirkiness which is Kim's trademark in his films is thoroughly within this concise and straightforward film.

And one more thing, the fact that those incest scenes were necessary to push the plot forward and create a believeable relationship between the stars, says much about Kim's respect for his audiences.  Kim knows his viewers aren't squeamish and he does not play anything lightly in this latest film effort.

8231349,3,B000Y9MTBK,"This South Korean tale of revenge, death and redemption is an entirely colourless, sordid and dreary affair, which requires a pretty strong (or else insensitive) constitution to stomach, with director Ki-duk Kim playing particularly to Western squeamishness in places, I suspect.  That said, the film is more arty than it is slasher and once it settles down (and if you can abide its over-riding unpleasantness) it has a quirky and at times clever plot line that makes it worth slogging through to the end.

A Western audience may well find most of the performances far from convincing, although Min-soo Jo's portrayal of the enigmatic and mysterious woman who one day appears in the life of debt collector Gang-Do (Jeong-jin Lee) claiming to be the mother who abandoned him at birth is marvellously disconcerting. Jo Young-Jik's cinematographic portrait of the squalor of the industrial sectors of South Korea is also quite breathtaking (albeit in a bad sort of way.)  While I doubt that the film will do well in the mainstream, I would expect it to become a cult classic in fairly short order.",1386806400,,1095,4.972677595628415
