8478673,4,B005LVH55G,This was one of the best movie serials ever released. The only drawback was that there was a coding error on one of the discs that cut off the last 5 or 6 minutes of one of the episodes.,1492905600,,186,3.7948717948717947

8478675,4,B005LVH55G,"This serial was my intro to Arthurian legend when I was a kid in a sawmill town with no library. It's done as a cliffhanger and stars George Reeves, the tragic first TV Superman. Like all those old serials, it was done on a shoestring and was obviously shot in the area around Los Angeles. The countryside doesn't look at all like England. But for a cheapo it looks pretty good. I suspect that one character, the Black Knight, was George Lucas' inspiration for Darth Vader: he wears black armor and wields a magic sword (Excalibur stolen from King Arthur).

The knights' armor looks a lot like the armor seen in Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail or like the armor in NC Wyeth's illustrations for The Boy's King Arthur.

They did a pretty good job of digitizing that old film although one chapter is truncated; maybe that part of the film was missing.

If you're a fan of derring-do and movie nostalgia, this is one to see.",1472601600,2,934,4.450292397660819
8478676,4,B005LVH55G,"I liked George Reeves as Superman during the first run TV series during the 50's and reruns later on. Previous to this, George Reeves starred in this series as a Knight of the Round Table. Although the reproduction could have been better, I find this series entertaining.  It gives a feel of George's prequel to his future version of the Superman character.",1455753600,,357,4.758064516129032
