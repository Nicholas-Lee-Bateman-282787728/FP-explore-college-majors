2711261,4,B000LP5FWC,"Watching Spike TV's fantasy action/adventure Afro Samurai is akin to dreaming and watching a Quinten Tarrantino film all in one. I used to be a huge fan of animae until it became mainstream crap.

But every once in a while there comes along something unique and special.

And that, my friends, is Afro Samurai. With the spectacular voices of Samuel L. Jackson, Ron Pearlman, and the ultra-sexy Kelly Hu, this has quickly become a major hit for Spike TV.

And for good reason.

With solid scripts and dream-like quality to the animation, Afro Samurai's bloody and action-packed episodes keep viewers wanting more with each and every episode.

Will Afro Samurai become #1? Stay tuned...",1170288000,3,684,4.964912280701754
2711262,5,B000LP5FWC,"I just caught the first ep showing on Spike Tv and WOW. Insane little anime. Really worth a watch and buy. The action is fast, violent and plenty of it. Samuel Jackson does the voice for two characters(maybe more). He of course does Afro the main character, but since Afro doesn't really talk all that much, most of it goes to this other guy that follows him around, who I think might just be in Afro's head. Pretty cool plot, there's two headbands, each with a number one and a number two. Afro's dad wore number one. Until number two killed him infront of his eyes. Here's how it works. The one that wears the number one headband means no one can challenge you. You're untouchable. Only the wearer of the number two has the right to challenge. But if you wear the number two headband it means that EVERYONE and ANYONE can challenge you. And that's pretty much the plot. Afro is making his way to see and challenge number one while fighting off the others that want his number two(headband). Anyway, watch and then later buy.",1167955200,19,1026,4.462765957446808

2711275,1,B000LP5FWC,"I had mistakenly allowed a friend to 'borrow' my previous copy of this cool anime. Needles to say, I never got it back. Thank GOODNESS for I could get another NEW copy of this flick which I can watch over and over again. One of the best Manga series I have ever come across but wish they had made MORE of. Excellent movie.

UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW:
I had not really 'opened' this disk before placing the previous review so I have to downgrade my stars. This product was sold as NEWbut it was NOT a new copy. It was a good LOOKING dvd while still wrapped in cover. Decided to watch this recently again, and saw the box was a bit worn on edges and disk had scratches. Worst YET dvd does not play once disk 1 chapter 3 starts (or tries to). VERY DISAPPOINTED this was being sold as NEW when it was USED.",1488326400,,798,4.115384615384615

2711337,5,B000LP5FWC,"Samuel L Jackson in his anime finest! Here is my review for Afro Samurai!! please enjoy!!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) In the world where it takes place is a some what futureistic and kinda fudal state of Japan. Warriors fight over two head bands. The #1 headband, who ever wears it is known as the worlds most badass fighter and only the #2 headband may challenge the #1 fighter. So everyone wants the #2 head band and will kill anyone who has it. our main character is only known as Afro Samurai. As a child Afro watched his father Rokutaro who had the #1 headband get killed by a gun slinger called Justice who was the #2 fighter in the world now is #1 and tells Afro when he is grown up one day to come back and fight him for the #1 head band. This is where Afro's jouney begins. Along with his friend Ninja Ninja played by Samuel L Jackson he will fight for the head band and revenge his father's death!

Pros: The Director's Cut series here is the UNCUT and UNCENSORED version. This series was once shown on Spike TV for all 5 episodes but they had it edited for blood and swearing, this series gives you the all the swearing you know Samuel L Jackson is known and the blood in the series. It is 5 episodes long, It is full of action and fighting so never a dull moment!

Cons: Nothing really bad here. Its such a super series!

Over all: I loved this series!! buy it!!! and its movie sequal Afro Samurai Resurrection which I will give a review for soon!!",1428710400,4,1476,4.260714285714286

2711363,3,B000LP5FWC,"Hello
I recently got the Afro Samurai directors cut from a grocery store on sale ad watched it. I originally saw this on spike many moons ago and loved it but I have to admit watching it again I loved it. It does have its problems though.

First off I love the animation and the voice acting are great and very well done from Ron Perlman as justice to sam Jackson as afro and ninja to Kelly hu they have all done a great job on the voice and the animation is great it is bloody a\when it needs to be fast and sensual also, it flows great and does not hold anything back.

There are two major problems though, I could not understand the story until I saw the extras which is ok but I believe you should get the story from the show not the extras, and there were a few exchanges between characters I did not understand. still this is a very stylish anime which blends east and west and is a great addition to any anime fans collection",1399248000,,932,4.115384615384615
2711364,4,B000LP5FWC,"I heard about this dvd. I was told it was good. I it use at a Rasputin Record store. It was not bad at all.
The story is bite bloody and revange.",1397692800,,145,3.5625
2711365,3,B000LP5FWC,"Pros(+): Great animations; Great music; Superior voice acting; Amazing production value
Negatives (-): EXTREMELY POOR PLOT; Little to no character development
Summary: Afro Samurai is a very pleasing looking Anime with some of the best visuals I have ever seen. The music and voice acting is extremely well done but the writing of Afro Samurai leaves much to be desired. It is very shallow and offers little in terms of plot twists. The whole series seems to be like a very long music video which is great for the first 30 minutes but then becomes extremely repetitive.

Let me first say that I am a huge Samuel L. Jackson and Wu-Tang Clan fan and was very pleased that the RZA was working on the soundtrack of Afro Samurai. Let's start this review with the positives Afro Samurai offers. From a visual and musical production point of view Afro Samurai is extremely well done. Over the course of watching the entire DVD collection, I often felt like I was watching a very action packed and special effects intensive hip-hop music video. The art style of Afro Samurai is also very pleasing to look at; environments, characters and particles are very sharp. The overall art style of Afro Samurai seems to be a very original type of anime with a dark color saturation that is comparable to the ever so popular Death Note series. The sound quality is superb, with Samuel L. Jackson providing witty remarks that serve as a comical relief in the very dark world of Afro Samurai. As noted by it's rating this anime is very adult oriented and features strong language, intense amount of gore, drug use, and sexual content (Parents keep your kids away).

The story is just your average revenge plot where our main character, Afro, is out to avenge his death. In the world of Afro Samurai status is the most important and desired object. The highest status a person can achieve is by becoming the Number 1 fighter by killing the current Number 1 fighter and taking the Number 1 headband. The second highest status a person can get is by getting the Number 2 headband. To get them you must kill. To get the Number 1 you must kill the Number 2 and to get to the Number 2 you have to compete with everyone else that desires the status of being Number 1. Naturally our main character's father possesses both the Number 1 and Number 2 headbands which cause for a traumatic life. Afro witnesses the death of his father by the series villain, Justice. Justice then tosses the Number 2 headband to Afro and tells him to come fight him for the Number 1 after he is older and stronger. THAT'S IT. THAT'S AFRO SAMURAI'S ENTIRE PLOT IN A NUTSHELL. No original ideas, character development and/or surprises. It would have been more interesting if Afro's father was somehow targeted by his own son after he had become old enough and desired the status of Number 1.

Everything about Afro Samurai screams HUGE budget which most likely lead to it's premature demise. I read that to produce a single thirty minute episode of Afro Samurai it was costing approximately $1,000,000. Most of the costs were probably to pay Samuel L. Jackson's and RZA's salaries. With such a lackluster plot it didn't take much time for Afro Samurai to be cancelled. If you are a fan of hip-hop music and Samuel L. Jackson then I recommend you check this one out but if not then stay away. Even with it's huge budget it is not very entertaining outside of it's musical score and visuals. I would recommend just checking out the soundtrack or possibly watching some clips of the show online.",1387238400,,3541,4.635350318471337

2711375,4,B000LP5FWC,"Blu ray looks beautiful. Top notch audio, video and plenty of good little extras for those that care for that. The anime itself is pretty good but just a little too over the top for me. I love Ninja Scroll and those type of super powered characters but some of the villains here are just too absurd even for an anime. One shoots out 50 or so missiles from a rocket launcher and then has missiles busting out of his hi-tech arm all the while his partner has a patch eye that is examining everything on the battlefield and Afro Samurai bob and weaves, slides, jumps, ducks, and runs past all of that without a single hint of desperation, anxiety, worrisome or stress. That's another fault of this otherwise pretty cool anime, afro samurai is too invincible at times.",1358726400,2,764,4.503597122302159
2711376,4,B000LP5FWC,"I'm a patient person, so the fact that this came a day late doesn't mean much, since the product itself made up for it.  BIGTIME.
The good:
The packaging is fantastic; I love the artwork on it.  The discs came in perfect condition, and both the featurettes and the film are awesome and top-notch, with an interesting featurette about the background which shares some interesting facts of the events leading up to how it was made, and the relationships between the actors and creators.  The movie itself is just as enjoyable as I remember--more so.  The animation is at its best at High School of the Dead-quality animation (another good show to check out).  The fight scenes are fun to watch and it's never a dull moment.
The bad:
Like I said, a day late.  But still, not much of a problem.  One OTHER minor complaint I have is that I wished they took out the credits between episodes so that it played like a movie.
But other than that, this still earns four stars, because it's AWESOME.",1350345600,2,988,4.51685393258427
2711377,5,B000LP5FWC,I think they should make another Afro Samurai because every warrior in the world wants to have the title of God which means that they would be coming after Afro Samurai for the number one headband. Plus just is able to regenerate himself with the ability of using blood cells. That means Afro will have to find some sort of way of extinguishing his enemy and any other opponents that may be in the way. Also if he does not end up with another series he will basically be one of the shortest series of cartoons I have ever seen especially considering it's design for an adult audience to view. At first I didn't think much on the television show until my friends recommended it but as i watched it I began to love the show more and more. I also believe there is more to Okiku's story than what's given but that is just my own personal opinion.,1336521600,2,842,4.30188679245283

The plot is a bit out there at times, but that's in the best tradition of anime.  I really enjoyed both films (they were originally shown on SpikeTV in episodic format).  The best thing about them is the amazing art design.  The graphics are computer aided and look awesome.  There is plenty of violence and, of course, anime boobs.

2711386,4,B000LP5FWC,"The popular anime and manga series is created by mangaka Takashi ""Bob"" Okazaki and produced by world renown Japanese animation company STUDIO GONZO (""Full Metal Panic"", ""Vandread"", ""Gantz"", ""Samurai 7' and many other anime) brought us the popular five-episode series (which aired in the US on SPIKE TV back in 2007 ) was released as a special Director's Cut featuring 15 minutes of never before seen footage.

The short animated TV series featured a collaboration with Samuel L. Jackson, creator Takashi Okazaki and anime production studio GONZO and took three years to develop and the series was followed by a movie titled ""Afro Samurai: Resurrection"" which takes place a year later after this series.

Because of it's impressive visuals, violent action scenes, unique characters (especially since the main character is a Black samurai) and its hip hop music courtesy of RZA (of Wu-Tang Clan fame), the anime attracted many fans in the US.

""Afro Samurai-Director's Cut"" features a total of 5 episodes on one DVD and comes with another disc with special features.  Here is a spoiler-less summary of each episode:

DISC 1:

  * EPISODE 1 - Revenge - The series features Afro when he was young and watched as his father was killed during a battle.  Now Afro, grown up and a feared samurai, is now wanting his revenge on the man who killed his father.
  * EPISODE 2 - The Dream Reader - Afro is taken care of by a woman named Okiku and we see flashbacks of Afro's past as a child bent on revenge.
  * EPISODE 3 - The Empty Seven Clan - A clan sends out a robot based on Afro to take on the Afro Samurai.
  * EPISODE 4 - Duel - Afro comes face-to-face on someone sporting a bear mask (a face resembling a teddy bear that Afro's young female friend used to have) and a flashback from Afro's past.
  * EPISODE 5 - Justice - The final battle between Afro and his childhood friend and the final confrontation between Afro and Justice.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

GONZO has done a remarkable job with this series.  The animation and the painted backgrounds are well-done!  Daytime scenes are colorful and vibrant and night-time scenes are dark and work well with this series.  It's also important to note that ""Afro Samurai - Director's Cut"" has quite a bit of talent involved with the look of the film such as character designer and animation director, Hiroya Iijima (""Gantz"", ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"" and ""Black Cat"").  Also, art direction from Shigemi Ikeda (""Gantz"", ""Gasaraki"", ""Inuyasha"", Infinite Ryvius, ""Black Cat"" and many of the ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" TV series and films).

The series is featured in 169 and for the most part, the picture quality really brings out the detail of the surroundings, including the rocky cliffs to the disembowelment of several characters.  And color from the lush green painted backgrounds, blue skies and huge clouds, villages and buildings to the action sequences which showcases a lot of blood.

As for the audio, ""Afro Samurai-Director's Cut"" is featured in English 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound and English stereo.  The series actually sounds quite awesome with the clanging of the swords and the metal healing, sounding quite awesome.  Also, scenes with weapons being launched or fireworks being shot up to the sky, ""Afro Samurai"" has a solid 5.1 presentation.  I actually prefer to listen to the series with my receiver set at stereo on all channels (especially for those that have a 7.2 or higher setup).

""Afro Samurai - Director's Cut"" is featured only in English, there is no Japanese soundtrack.  Voice acting is well done by actors Samuel L. Jackson, Ron Perlman and Yuri Lowenthal.  Samuel L. Jackson definitely brings out the believability of both Afro and Ninja Ninja and gives the series that cool, funky vibe.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Afro Samurai - Director's Cut"" features the following special features:

  * In the Booth - Voice Talent of Afro Samurai - (14:48) Interviews with voice talent Samuel L. Jackson, Ron Perlman, Kelly Hu, creator Takahashi Okazaki and co-producer Eric Calderon discussing how the series came about.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I know that I'm coming on to this series quite late but for the most part ""Afro Samurai - Director's Cut"" is a solid series.  It's definitely a violent series full of blood and dismembered body parts but it's interesting to see how samurai anime-based series has come since the early 90's.  The action is fast and fierce but for ""Afro Samurai"", the series is highly stylized.  Even the blood flowing and how the colors are feature is quite artistic in presentation.

Of course, some people may have a hard time seeing characters that are non-Japanese who are samurai, especially a Black anti-hero with a huge afro.  But Takashi ""Bob"" Okazaki, who was a big hip hop fan definitely was inspired by the music and wanting to do something different and sure enough, Afro Samurai was a unique creation.  Okazaki has done a wonderful job with this series and for the most part, doing something unique and different.  ""Afro Samurai"" may feature five episodes but in the overall plan, Okazaki has mentioned, that the series is just a very small part of what he has planned for Afro Samurai and for the most part, one can only hope that the series receives a larger storyline than just five episodes.

The ""Afro Samurai"" series has star power with Samuel L. Jackson, Ron Perlman and Kelly Hu contributing their voices to the series.  You have RZA bringing the hip hop to Japanese animation, so for the most part, it's a unique blend of East meets West in bringing two cultures together.  I felt that was pretty awesome!

GONZO also has done a fantastic job on the animation and artistic backgrounds for this series.  I felt the action and fighting choreography was well done!  Again, everything is stylized.  Even down to the packaging of this release.  I have to say that ""Afro Samurai-Director's Cut"" also features a pretty awesome package design.  Featuring a magnetic case and how the folds are, it's pretty cool.

As for the TV MA rating, despite the series being shown on television, this is not a series to have children around watching.  It's violent, bloody and features nudity and a sex scene.  In fact, some might find the series a bit disturbing and too gory for their tastes.

Overall, if you are a fan of ""Afro Samurai"" that was shown on television, the director's cut features 15 extra minutes will definitely entertain you.  I personally can't comment on where the extra footage is located but I would assume that the majority of those extra minutes are the extremely violent scenes.

As for my opinion on the series, for one, its short. The series obviously focuses more on the fighting and violence and the goal for people to become #2 in order to fight the #1 fighter.  I felt that the nature of this series was keeping the Western audiences in mind but utilizing Japanese animation by GONZO.  As far as storyline execution goes, ""Afro Samurai"" is nowhere near the deepness of other samurai anime like ""Samurai Champloo"", ""Hakkenden"", ""Rurouni Kenshin"" or ""Samurai 7'.  But again, the series is short and Okazaki has not had the opportunity to have a full-length animated series.

But it's also a different style of anime that although it uses the concept of samurai and has some inclusion of Japanese culture, the series is very Western.  Afro is stoic, while Ninja Ninja could be easily too vocal or mildly annoying but what I did like about the series is its style.  Sure, it's bloody but somehow the way these fight scenes, no matter how violent they were, the execution was quite artistic in someway.

Also, the series is unique and how it tries to bring together samurai and hip hop music.  And of course, having the main character being a Black protagonist.  But ""Afro Samurai"" is a series that is literally action and style over substance.  If Okazaki was given a chance to have a full-length anime series of 26 episodes, it would be interesting to see what he would be capable of plot-wise.

Overall, ""Afro Samurai"" was entertaining, violent, gruesome but visually stylized.  It was something different and that's a good thing.  Also, the fact that you can find ""Afro Samurai - Director's Cut"" online for a pretty cheap price, definitely makes this DVD release worth checking out.",1260316800,,8729,4.82099596231494
2711387,4,B000LP5FWC,"I'm really not into the animated action flick.  I just have never been interested in action that's in a cartoon, as since it's a cartoon, of course they can do amazing action, be it slicing a bullet with a sword or falling down a cavern only to land safely.  Given its reputation as a action cartoon, I wasn't too excited to see Afro Samurai, but I did, and am glad I did.  First, I loved the multiple homages to classic kung fu movies.  The basic premise of the son avenging the father, the quite son who learns how to be a great kung fu master with his samurai, any fight after fight.  Where it really surprising me was the blending of so many different styles.  While the movie definitely is meant to be a old school samurai film, it clearly is very modern, and in some cases, futuristic.  There are cell phones, robots, guns and rockets.  Yet the towns and buildings are so old school they seems out of the 12th century.  The best part is the blending was very natural, and didn't feel like they were trying to blend too many things, but just doing what was needed and interesting in the story.

Speaking of the story, it was surprisingly complex for such a basic premise.  A story of son avenging his father is the basic story.  However, the movie finds many ways of adding interesting side stories and depth to make the story feel more real, and far more interesting.  I liked how it was done, and where it went.  As the animation, like I said, its not really my thing, but I did enjoy the way it worked.  The fighting wasn't particulalry interesting to me, but I did like how it was done.  The abundance of blood, the way flashbacks were intermingled with fights, and the way the background seemed relevant to the story were all very good.

Needless to say, I was very impressed with Afro Samurai, and it is not something of which I am usually a fan.  I suggest if you're looking for some entertainment and something different you should give this a try.",1253232000,,1961,4.4

2711390,2,B000LP5FWC,"Right off the bat I was disappointed in this because when I buy a dvd collection that says ""SEASON ONE"" i expect a season, not 5 episodes! (thats false advertising!) I did not realize this until the last episode and it was by far one of the most over-rated animes ever.
Visually speaking this is great work. the characters appearance and their mannerisms were unique. I especialy liked samuel jackson's contribution as ninja ninja and I like that it opened animes to a crowd of people that may not like anime. This gets it the two stars I gae but thats all i can say good about it.
The plot was, for lack of a better word, bad. The story was rushed, every fight scene had a well animated more or two but the rest of the fight would be a ""been there, done that"" kind of fight. The only unique battle I can recall was the fight against afrobot, it was entertaining, but not that good. Afro was a totally uninteresting character who was not likeable, I actually thought  Justice was the good guy by the end of the anime because Afro was so bland and cliche (a jimi hendrix lookin guy with an afro smoking a joint. . . wooow original) And why did they make such a big deal about the soundtrack? Not that monumental, definatley thought Rza would contribute more to a major anime soundtrack than those bootleg mixtape level beats.
All in all this was, as the title says, a recycled Samurai Champloo. This was another ""been there, done that"" moment for me becuase Samurai Champloo already conquered the Hip-Hop/Samurai Anime idea and did so in epic proportions. If you are a fan of anime then you will treat this like a mediocre painting, you'll look at it, say thats nice, and never want to look at it again.

2711393,4,B000LP5FWC,"This anime was  different from other series I have watched in its overall selling point and focus. Despite the common claim that the show is lacking in plot, I believe that something like that should be expected from only a five part series. It's obvious it's not going to be as profound as the oftenly compared works of Shinchiro Watanabe (i.e. Cowboy bebop, Samurai Champloo). The story is about revenge and that is the main push for the series. Having only that as the main part of the series should point towards obvious shallowness in plot and story because revenge is shallow. Animation was fantastic and top of the line. Voice acting was good but not amazing. Its better than a lot of american dubs like the Kenshin series (the 80+ ep. Tv one) which had a lot of problems. If you are looking for a series with character development and relationship growth, don't try Afro Samurai and look for something that you would like. This show is totally bare bones but if you are looking for pure action, sex, profanity, and gore. Afro Samurai might be for you.",1240790400,,1059,4.603174603174603
2711394,2,B000LP5FWC,"I own this DVD set.  And though I like it, that doesn't change the fact that it sucks lead bricks. Why do you watch action movies? For action.  Why do you watch ... well you get the idea.

This is an action series.  The beautiful graphics always deliver, and so do the fight scenes.  The characters, histories, items, and weapons are all very creative and original (although the plot devices are anything but original -- oh wait, did I say plot? What plot?).

And I know other reviewers got sick of Samuel Jackson's voice after a while, but I didn't at all, and was glad to continue watching the series (Of course, I often fast-forwarded with subtitles turned-on during the fast-forwarding, to get to those action scenes or those scenes that seem important without slowing the pace). I still have faith in Samuel L. Jackson's acting abilities, despite his part in the new SW trilogy.

That being said, the dialog, motivations, character interaction, etc. are all sub-par.  It's really stupid. And I mean really stupid.

If you like great martial arts, then rent this and keep the fast-forward button handy.  If you love great graphics, martial arts movies, and Samuel L. Jackson, buy it anyway, and keep the fast-forward button handy.  Just keep in mind, you'll be using the fast-forward button often.

The voicovers were good, but one of my main gripes was that Afro Samurai rarely talks. Samuel L. Jackson lends his talent, as both Afro and his friend, but Jackson speaks 90% of the time as Afro's friend. The plot is very basic and dull, just a one-tracked story of vengeance. The action was top-notch, and I did find myself pleased at the end of the series.

2711403,4,B000LP5FWC,"Afro Samurai brings to mind many classics of Japanese-American pop-art, such as Lone Wolf and Cub (the path of the doomed samurai killer) and Samurai Jack (the quiet taciturn samurai on an impossible quest...in a world that blends the ancient and the advanced), to mention the two that jump out at me.  The animation and art are fantastic and unusual; despite the strong anime influences, I initially thought it was American due to the strong resemblance to the work of Peter Chung (Aeon Flux) and even The Boondocks animated series (another possible influence).  However, I have since discovered that this is a Japanese production that was dubbed into English.

The dubbed dialog is a mixed bag.  The translated script is perhaps the most convincing I've ever heard, although the delivery of the voice actors falls a little short.  To be honest, I thought Samuel L. Jackson is a bit of a ham-fisted choice.  He works better in his duties as Ninja Ninja than as the titular Afro.  Jackson doesn't really know how to do ""reserved"" in a convincing fashion.  Ron Perlman is mostly wasted as Justice.  He shows up only at the beginning and end, and he's doing a bit of a weird semi-Southern accent.  None of the voice actors truly stood out for me.

The characters themselves are a bit flat, mostly props for the incredible action and thick atmosphere.  The script doesn't give them any room for development, but to be fair, this isn't the kind of story where everyone learns something and goes home a little wiser.  That's fine.  It's tempting to condemn Afro Samurai for being an empty exercise in flashy style, but I think there's a little more to it than that.  The themes of the uselessness and tragedy of violence and revenge are intriguing, and sometimes powerful.  This is inevitably undermined a bit by the glorification of violence in the many gory and lyrical action set pieces.

As for the style, and the art, Afro Samurai is pretty much impeccable on all counts.  From RZA's score to the creepy Japanese puppet-type cyborgs, this show hits all the right notes...sometimes, too well.  When it is too tasteful, polished and stylized, it can lose a little bit of its soul, not unlike its various old men and cyborgs who have sold themselves for power and revenge.  Afro Samurai isn't perfect, but it's damn entertaining.  The atmosphere, art, action and dramatic themes almost overcome its occasional shallowness.",1233446400,,2419,4.851219512195122

I am looking forward to season 2 and hope this time around they have more episodes than the first(5 only). I really have been impressed with Japan's interest in Black anime as of late(The Boondocks etc)and hope this continues as I am tired of seeing the same caucasian style characters male and female to tell stories that are so much more universal than what has been shown for so many years.

But that's where it loses those 2 stars.

While the animation is amazing, nothing else stands out. The story is a shallow excuse for gore and titillation; the dialouge is cringe inducing; Justice is the only unique and/or likeable character (ironically enough).

That somehow, Tarantino's steal from this genre, has redefined itself as 'Tarantino style'.

2711440,4,B000LP5FWC,"Alright, so Afro Samurai set out to answer the age old question: ""If you take an insanely high animation budget, a breathtaking soundtrack, spectacularly choreography fight scenes, and a well-known actor and combine it with a plot that's ludicrously stupid, will the result still be cool?""  The answer is yeah... but barely.  As the pinnacle of simplistic action samurai movies, this will not disappoint.  In ever other way it does.  Sadly, just some minimal dialogue edits could have down wonders for the overall story.
So I will assume you both saw the show on Spike TV or Youtube, and still wish to purchase the series.  You are now wondering ""Is the extra 15 minutes worth double the price of the edited DVDs?""  No, not really; however, it does improve the story in the last 2 episodes.  Here is a basic breakdown of what you missed on TV.
All the episodes contain small cuts of slightly more excessive gore, a few f-bombs, and long shots of scenery.  Small snippets of dialogue were also cut here and there, especially the ninja's.
Episode one- A fallen warrior that just collapses in the edited version gives a really long speech before dropping in the uncut.  The bar patrons bicker and threaten each other and a mini fight break out.  The Empty Seven talk a bit more about their plans.  Overall, I prefer the edited version of this episode.  The dead guy talked way too long about Afro's legend and the dialogue seemed really corny and fake.  The bar scene makes the whole town appear violent and psychotic.  The scene where the Empty Seven talks expands their background, but their story is severely lacking and the more you show the emptier they feel.
Episode two has some additional scenes of Afro in the orphanage that was useful to the story.  In a fairly boring scene, we see Afro's first taste of lemonade.  There was also a sort of cute but short scene of Afro hanging out with his girl while Kuma learns about sword fighting.  Nothing spectacular was cut.  There is still no more explanation for how she can read dreams.  Ninja Ninja is also slightly more vulgar.  You see a few quick shots of the chick's [...] in an expanded sex, shower, and death scene.
Episode 3-Well we learns why the Empty Seven decided to have Afro Droid fight their other assassins.  Mostly, just talking was cut.  The Empty Seven battle is the same expect we see Number 3 offer Afro tea, and he just walks by.
Episode four-Okay, so important story parts were edited out here.  There are some additional scenes in the orphanage where Kuma's own theories help shape Afro's decision.  There's a scene were all the kids say what they would like to do before dying, and the girl says see some fireworks.  Kuma also tries to persuade Afro to leave the bandanas alone, but fails.
Episode 5-We also see some more of what happened to Kuma after falling off the cliff and getting rebuilt.  These scenes were probably wise to cut because they only continue to make Kuma a more sympathetic character than Afro.  There is a bunch of additional dialogue regarding Justice, his goals and dreams, and the power of the bandanas.  These are really important scenes that should have not been edited out.  There were also a few shots of how Afro reached him, and how Justice revived his body to fight Afro.  There is a SLIGHTLY expanded ending, but it really adds nothing to the story.
The extras on the second disc total 40 minutes and could easily fit onto the first DVD.  The extras are mildly interesting, but if you miss them it doesn't really matter.  I think this was included just to try to convince you to shell out the extra bucks.
Are these extra scenes worth the additional $15?  No.  The entire series, uncut, is only worth about $[...], which is the typical Ebay price.

Probably the reason why they kept it short, so they could test the water and if it sells well, we'll see a lot more of this type of ""anime"" in the future.

2711500,4,B000LP5FWC,"I find myself perplexed over the fact that I hadn't come across this show before. While I'm usually put off by anime, this one comes across as something more. Samuel Jackson was what got me interested, and by the end of the first episode I realized what a treat it was.

'Afro Samurai?!' you say? Yes, the name is a little laughable, as is the over-the-top gore featured therein, but damn is this show fun. An aged man, Afro is out to seek the number one fighter position from the man who carries it now - the man who killed Afro's father to gain the headband (which reads ""Ichi ban"" or ""Number One"" in Japanese). Afro is the infamous Number Two, so only he has the ability to challenge Number One, his father's murderer, Justice. However, anyone on the planet is allowed to challenge Afro, so we're able to see how hard his life can be (and this partially answers the question as to why he's so silent for most of the show), and why he might have an invisible Ninja alter-ego.

I won't spoil any more of the story than that. The music is done by The RZA, and the soundtrack offers up nice beats that create the atmosphere just as much as the visuals do. It's based on a comic, and only five episodes, but for whatever shortcomings it may have (vulgarity shouldn't turn you off if you're in the market for this subject anyways) it leaves an impression. I would recommend this to any fan of anime or adult animation in general.

My favorite character is the kanye west-esque samurai (dont worry, you'll get it) The greastest thing about the show is it's brevity. Many anime fall short of being accessible to a wide audience because 25% of it is actual story and character development. While the rest of the show is filler galore. In terms of anime, afro samurai is super short(Only five episodes clocking in at 2 hours and five minutes) but every second of it will keep you fiending for more. For long time fans of anime who've always had trouble introducing outsiders to your world, this is the perfect gateway to get them hooked.

2711519,4,B000LP5FWC,"Afro Samurai is one of those ideas that doesn't sound promising on paper, but oce it's put to screen, it's so close to glory that you can't help but wonder why you thought it would have been anything different.  Originally aired on Spike TV, all five episodes of Afro Samurai are here on DVD in all it's uncut and unedited glory on DVD, as Samuel L. Jackson lends his voice to the revenge driven, title character who as a child witnessed his father being murdered by the insane Justice (Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman).  Now, Afro works his way up the food chain in an effort to become the ""Number One"" warrior in all of the world, and get his bloody revenge.  What Afro Samurai lacks in it's overall story more than makes up for it in style.  The animation is striking and brilliant with incredibly sweeping detail, and the voice cast, which also includes Kelly Hu, Phil LaMar, and a host of voice acting veterans, is superb.  The only real downsides to Afro Samurai are with the main character himself.  Afro hardly as any kind of character development whatsoever and isn't as sympathetic a character as one might think.  Despite that though, Afro Samurai still features a great soundtrack by The RZA, and Jackson also lends his voice to Afro's semi-sidekick Ninja Ninja, who provides some funny moments.  All in all, Afro Samurai is a memorable, American-ized anime with a hip-hop flavor, and this violent, uncut version is definitely worth picking up for viewers who wanted more from the TV broadcast and anime fans in general.",1181952000,4,1522,4.716981132075472
2711520,5,B000LP5FWC,"I watched Afro Samurai on Spike TV back in January when they first aired the edited episodes.  I was thrilled when I found out they were releasing a director's cut of the production with an extended ending since I could not get past how bland the show felt on TV.  For those of you who thought that Afro Samurai was a rushed anime with no real substance, the director's cut of the show fixes a lot of the shortcomings.  Spike TV not only edited the mature content but ended up cutting the scenes to make room for the half hour time lapse.  In my opinion the director's cut of Afro Samurai adds more depth to the characters and completes the series. The picture and sound are restored to their intended form creating a beautiful anime.  Aside from the restoration, yes many have commented that Afro the character lacks in personality with his jabber sidekick Ninja Ninja filling in his dialogue.  Afro is a scarred being and his sidekick is his only mental expression. Consider the story of Afro as he explores life as a boy pulled out of innocence and straight into the world of killing. The anime is for people who are willing to look closer at the message and theme the animator is telling through the tone of blaxploitation.  In the end it has many redeemable qualities with characters and story handled with a mixture of old feudal Japan and post-modern future culture. It is also a simple story about how violence and vengeance create an endless circle of carnage, destroying the chance for good in life. Afro's quest is a meditation on power existing in a world lacking in control. In the end Afro Samurai is an imaginative story, with unusual, likable characters developed by Takashi Okasaki. For those of you who are planning on watching it for the first time get the complete director's cut anime.",1181779200,10,1806,4.625
2711521,3,B000LP5FWC,"Recently I got into the show Samurai Champloo, done by the man responsible for the much-praised Cowboy Bebop. That show oozes style and panache while still maintaining a compelling atmosphere and likable characters. Afro Samurai on the other hand just tries way too hard to be cool and its emphasis on that ""coolness"" completely robs it of anything else it wants to have when presenting this old-yet-anachronistic world. Meaning this is a show where there was more time spent on its visuals than anything else and you can very much see that is the case although the more testosterone-driven people might disagree with me.

Comprised of 5 episodes, Samuel L. Jackson plays Afro who has a boy saw his father killed right in front of him by the evil Justice. Justice wants the #1 headband which says that he is the best fighter ever. Afro, growing up and full of dreams of revenge, has the #2 headband which means only he can take on the number one. Only thing is whoever is number 2 has to fight everyone and really anyone who thinks they can take him on. And so the bulk of the series is basically Afro taking on any moron who thinks they can go after him as well as revealing backstory on old friends and how he got the #2 headband back.

First I should talk about the positives because the negatives might be a little bit extensive. Gonzo Animation, known for such titles as Samurai 7, Trinity Blood, and Chrono Crusade, Gonzo has really outdid themselves with the animation here with is just as fluid and beautiful as it should be with character designs on the mark a large part of the time which was a problem I always saw with Samurai 7. One battle, taking place in a snowfield is just as serene in its atmosphere as is some of the lighting in other places. However, the fights, while cool, have a certain overeager quality or a lack of confidence and they're almost haphazardly directed and hard to tell what's going half the time. It's here where it's easy to see it's basically a case of ""if it looks cool, who cares if the action's confusing?""

Here's where I'm basically going to bomb the series. Characters aren't terribly interesting. Afro is so quiet and withdrawn that he's not the most likable anti-hero around. At least Hellsing was a likable bad***, as skillful in battle as he was cool to root for. Jackson also plays Ninja Ninja which is the antithesis of Afro's quiet demeanor. This is the Jackson you'd probably hear the most in films as he has that kind of ""I'm the man"" tone of voice and he quickly gets irritating. You almost wish Afro would pull a Fight Club on him (if you've seen the movie, I've probably spoiled this for you). As for the 2 other stars, Kelly Hu and Ron Perlman, playing Okiku and Justice respectively, they're barely in this. Not that they do good jobs anyway.

There's way better anime out there such as Bebop, Champloo, Kenshin, hell even Fruits Basket is better than this. Should you at least rent it and try it out? Sure. Some of you will love it and find ""this **** is the bomb!"" while others will find a rather hollow anime entry.",1181692800,28,3080,4.514336917562724

After the fight is over Justice takes the number one headband off of the head of Afro's father, which was not too far away from his body. Justice tells Afro something similar to what Uma Thurman said to Vivica A. Fox's daughter in Kill Bill, that if he wanted revenge he would fight him when he came for him.

Afro took those words very seriously and took a few things of his fathers including his very cool Katana. Afro immediately went from an innocent child to an almost emotionless man with a ton of weight on him as he begins his vengeful journey. Afro Samurai is a unique anime or story for that matter. You don't see too many people willing to put out a story with basically nothing but very bloody fight scenes for about two episodes before a really good story starts up. Especially in a 5 part series where the episodes are only between 20 and 30 minutes long. I can't lie because I love stuff like that and it made Afro Samurai all the more tempting to finish watching. The second is that this was a pricy anime to make costing $1 million per episode so I'm sure a few viewers from the Hip hop community were expected to watch this. Even if you're an action film fan you have to admit when there's too much action and not enough story Even in a revenge tail like Kill Bill with a certain scene that this anime could relate to 88 times over it had a mystery and story.

Afro was on the verge of being in the too much and not enough category and then a cool story hits you somewhere around the end of episode two. Flashbacks of Afro's life are showed, you see him as a kid again and the people who took him in and gave him his gritty skills. All throughout the 5 part series you see that the money was well spent because the animation is amazing and beautiful. The things that Afro does with his skills are crazy and this animation was a giant step up for anime samurai fight scene, it was flawless. The voice actors are great including Sam Jackson who is great for co-producing this and putting his foot in it.

 I think it would have been cool to actually give Afro a real name, it's cool for people that take him on to call him Afro but I think he should have had a name for his other life before he became the Afro Samurai. In other words I kind of wish the story went just a bit deeper with a little bit more complexity. I think that Afro Samurai is a great series that everyone should see especially to view its beautiful quality.",1170979200,33,3021,4.212435233160622
2711528,4,B000LP5FWC,"Come on, how could you go wrong?  Afro.  Samurai.  Samuel L Jackson.  If this isn't a recipe for awesome, I don't know what is.  If the notion doesn't immediately strike you that this is the coolest concept ever, move along; there's nothing for you to see here.  But if you're a fan of animated carnage and you think that Sam Jackson is the king of cool, then this series is well worth it.

The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world (don't they all?) and follows Afro's pursuit of the ""#1 Headband"" which is said to grant god-like power to the one who possesses it.  Just so happens that the guy who currently possesses it killed our main man's father right in front of him at an early age, hence Afro's quest for vengeance.  The trick is that nobody can challenge the owner of the ""#1 Headband"" unless he possesses the ""#2 Headband"".  Needless to say, the owner of #2 is beset on all sides by every bloodthirsty yahoo who lusts for the power of the #1.  That's where the endless carnage comes in.  Limbs and heads fly to and fro with whimsical abandon, blood splatters everywhere, death is at pretty much every stop on the Afro-train. Along the way he encounters seductive kunoichi, cyborgs, a dual-bladed opponent in a teddy bear mask, a rocket-launching psychopath, a cybernetic double, and much, much more.

The backstory is filled in with near-constant flashbacks, some of which help alleviate the confusion of what the hell you are watching, and some of which just add to it.  The series is short, real short.  Like, five 20+ minute episodes short.  This is enough to satisfy one's bloodlust and build a decent story, but not nearly enough to fully flesh out the world or the people who inhabit it.  The series is fantastic and a great introduction to the anime art form for the curious and uninitiated, but it's not perfect.  The ending kind of left me cold, as the final battle is rather anti-climactic, and it never really shows what #1's ""god-like powers"" entail; or if they are just a legend.  All these guys seem to do once they get it is sit atop the mountain and wait for the next sucker to climb on up and challenge them.  There is one confrontation that takes a full episode and half of another to conclude because it is packed so full of flashbacks.  This is acceptable when you have a full season of a show to pad, but not when you've only got 5 episodes to pack with all the awesomeness one expects from a series named ""Afro Samurai"".  Still, this one is a must-see for animation fans.

The director's cut gives us an extra dose of blood, some nudity, and a little extra much-appreciated character development that adds much to an already great series. The extra disc gives us a brief ""making of"" documentary and a well put together featurette profiling the many interesting characters Afro meets (and beats) during his journey.  There is also a very short segment about The RZA's, excellent score. Samuel L Jackson's resume speaks for itself and his performance as Afro's companion (Afro himself rarely speaks) provides constant humorous and stylish banter that does a great job of both lightening the tone of a show where nearly every character is stoic and deadly serious -if not tragic- and giving voice to Afro's innermost doubts and fears.  Ron Perlman is another who never disappoints and his performance as #1 is bone-chilling.  The very sexy Kelly Hu also turns in a great contribution.  Bottom line: if you like afros, if you like samurai, if you like animation, and if you like violence then this show is for you.",1170374400,30,3551,4.6309904153354635
