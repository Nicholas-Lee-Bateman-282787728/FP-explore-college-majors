7357924,5,B012PN6FTY,"Brilliant movie and the importance of intuition & faith in creative breakthroughs.
Hope the new movie with Jeremy Irons will be as good.  Thanks for adding to Prime....
If only he could have found a good Indian cook or restaurant provided by the
university he contributed so much math brilliance to at the time.....
Math fro me was always more about art & vision and less about science
which Einstein understood as well...",1462406400,,422,4.780821917808219

7357926,5,B012PN6FTY,"Excellent visual and audio quality documentary detailing the life and accomplishments of one of the worlds greatest unsung mathematical geniuses, Srinivasa Ramanujan. In March of 1914, against social and religious taboo, Srinivasa Ramanujan a self-taught Indian mathematician, left his wife, family and friends in India to sail to Trinity College in Cambridge, England. He was just twenty-six years old.

With almost no formal training in pure mathematics, Ramanujan made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. When his skills became apparent to the wider mathematical community, he began a famous partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy. He rediscovered previously known theorems in addition to producing new work.
During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3900 results (mostly identities and equations) Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct, although a small number of these results were actually false and some were already known. He stated results that were both original and highly unconventional, such as the Ramanujan prime and the Ramanujan theta function, and these have inspired a vast amount of further research. The Ramanujan Journal, an international publication, was launched to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by his work.
This documentary was produced in 1987 during the centenary of Ramanujans birth, and tells the insightful story of a humble clerk working at the Port Trust Office in Madras, who came to the attention of G.H. Hardy in 1913, a Cambridge mathematician and Fellow of Trinity College, when he received a ten-page letter containing many mathematical formulae and theorems.

Although no plaques or busts appear at Trinity College in Cambridge to commemorate the life and achievements of Srinivasa Ramanujan, his findings have since been published and disseminated worldwide in honor of his great work and achievements in the area of mathematics.

A really interesting, compelling and educational program for anyone interested in mathematics  this is a must see!!!!",1438128000,3,2261,5.720238095238095
8726436,5,B012PN6FTY,"This documentary is as insightful as the movie, ""The Man who Knew Infinity."" Of course one would certainly benefit more from this documentary because it provides one with different details about Ramanujan's life. A must see!",1484697600,,224,5.25
8726437,5,B012PN6FTY,"The video quality was poor on m computer screen, but when I streamed it to my flat screen TV it was much better. But this is a movie in which the interesting stuff is spoken. One wouldn't lose much by just listening to the soundtrack.",1479168000,,234,4.222222222222222
