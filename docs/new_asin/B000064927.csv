1706928,3,B000064927,"While I originally watched the movie because I enjoy Amanda Tapping on Stargate SG-1, I was pleasantly surprised.  The plot is pretty typical:  Will anyone ever invent an alternate energy source that doesn't threaten to blow up the earth?
Though Adrian Paul isn't overly believable as a nerd, with or without glasses, that doesn't take too much away from the overall enjoyment of the movie.  Tapping does a pretty good job of playing her save-the-world-scientist character differently from her Stargate SG-1 Major Carter.  The two are fairly believable as a couple.  Malcolm McDowell gives a standard performance as Adrian Paul's boss, the guy Tapping suspects is responsible for her father's death.
The movie has almost as much violence as one of Adrian Paul's ""Highlander"" movies, and even a little sex, if you like that sort of thing.",1025827200,19,837,5.08029197080292

1706963,3,B000064927,"Obviously made to capitalize on public jitters over the large hadron collider, the Void casts Stargate principal Amanda Tapping as the lone scientist who discovers a dangerous fault in a secret military particle accelerator (it blows up and makes black holes). The director of the project is willing to kill to protect his work, and predictably the only person who knows the sinister truth must use any mean necessary to save the world. These direct-to-video sci fi films tend to follow a pretty predictable formula, so I'll break this review down into its constituent parts:

Lone Token Celebrity:
Subverted, as this movie brings us Stargate's Amanda Tapping, Highlander's Adrian Paul, and Everything Else's Malcolm McDowell. Guess who plays the evil project director?

Lesson About Man's Hubris:
Moderate. If you let a crazy scientist build a supercollider without someone checking his work, he might blow up a bunch of Belgians.

Carnage:
Realistic and better for it. There is a brief and pretty well done foot chase following a murder, and some scienc-ey facilities shake themselves apart. The actual black hole doesn't make its appearance until near the end but it's decent. Fair warning: The city being sucked into oblivion on the box? That never happens. Don't get your hopes up.

Awful Effects:
The black hole itself and the debris being sucked into it look pretty good. However, eventually silly CGI cracks start appearing all over Malcolm McDowell's science bunker to drag in chairs, lab techs, and stray coffee cups, and they don't look so hot.

Romantic Subplot:
SPICAY. Tapping's character initially uses Paul's character for information but they fall in love and have nerdy, talkative PG sex. Eventually the betrayal comes to light, they fight, then they make up and have R-rated sex, using bodies that are pretty obviously not really theirs. One wonders if directors can simply buy stock reels of sex scenes with no visible heads? It's all very 90s Showtime.

Big Action Truck:
Nobody has a big truck, which is uncommon in these movies. Moreover, there are no powerboats, humvees, or other common action vehicles. One guy gets hit by a car though.

Overall, the Void is a surprisingly entertaining DtV sci-fi thriller that avoids some of the more predictable decisions such movies usually make. The cast is quite good, especially if you like science fiction TV shows, although I felt Tapping and Paul lacked some of the chemistry they were meant to have.",1357948800,,2469,5.066502463054187
1706964,1,B000064927,"I purchased this movie because I really like the actress Amanda Tapping.  The movie started out really good, and was very interesting.  But then, she decides to do a love scene, a very explicit one.  So, in the trash the movie went.  Too bad.  The premise was very good.  Liquorish",1342483200,2,281,4.52
1706965,3,B000064927,"I was able to finish watching this one without too much difficulty; I think one would have to be a disaster movie fan to watch it all the way through. I am one so I could. If you have the opportunity, watch the streaming version first then decide if you want a copy of your own.

It does have some interesting moments and managed to hold my attention reasonably well. If you're a collector you'll want to check this one out and you may even decided to add it to your collection. I'm glad I took the time to watch it.",1326758400,,516,4.108910891089109
1706966,3,B000064927,"O.k. maybe it is as standard disaster film. However it has Hallmark overtones. It even has Hallmark style background music.

 Prof. Steven Price (Adrian Paul) is being used in more ways than one buy vixen, Prof. Eva Soderstrom (Amanda Tapping).  While pilfering data from a research facility, Amanda finds that the facility ran by the autocratic Dr. Thomas Abernathy (Malcolm McDowell) is about to ""void"" the earth.

If it were not for flat screens and cell phones you would think this was a fifty's sci-fi. Oh yes they throw in cuddling scenes with bodies in the au natural. There is a ""hole"" lot of sucking. But is there a solution?",1316908800,,634,4.736363636363636
1706967,3,B000064927,"Can we all just get together and decide that creating black holes of any size just isn't a good idea?  One can't help but think of the experiments involving the Large Hadron Collider when watching The Void.  The disaster scenario that plays out in this film isn't all that farfetched, as it hinges on the arrogance of select scientists and the reckless determination of a project head more than willing to take any risk to make his decades-long pet project come to fruition.  A significant number of scientists in the real world don't play well with others, ignore or dismiss out of hand any criticism - no matter how valid - of their work, and have been caught red-handed tampering with their own data.  Yet we're supposed to fully trust these guys when they tell us there is no danger whatsoever - even after repeated delays due to equipment malfunctions - hurtling particles together at extreme speeds.  The reality is that one tiny mistake in their calculations could literally kill us all.  Needless to say, watching The Void did nothing to ease my concerns about CERN.

Unfortunately, The Void just isn't that good of a movie.  I give it exceedingly average scores all around.  Amanda Tapping does her best to save the world as academic physicist Eva Soderstrom, but the script doesn't do her any favors.  Her co-star Adrian Paul looks and acts like a human punching bag, and his penchant to make jokes during even the most serious of occasions is beyond annoying.  Michael McDowell is, of course, quite good as the bad guy, Dr. Thomas Abernathy, but I for one am growing tired of his evil scientist shtick.  The man is too prolific for his own good in movies of this type.

The folks at the Atomic Energy Commission are apparently unaware that Dr. Abernathy's project to create a clean and almost unlimited power source has already failed miserably eight years earlier in Luxembourg, resulting in the deaths of everyone involved in the project - except Abernathy, of course.  One of those victims was the father of Eva Soderstrom, who has been after the covered-up truth ever since.  She finally finds an ""in"" in the form of Steven Price (Adrian Paul), adjunct professor and high-ranking engineer in Abernathy's new company.  After hacking into the data she needs, she quickly sees that Abernathy's computations are wrong, which means his imminent new experiment is going to create an atomic black hole that will either suck the earth into its dense depths or explode - either way, Planet Earth is seriously screwed.  Unfortunately, she only has a few days to stop Abernathy and save the world, no one - including her engineer boyfriend - wants to hear what she has to say, and someone seems determined to kill her and anyone who might be helping her.

Don't let the box cover fool you.  That huge sucking sound you hear is in fact Abernathy's particle collider, but you won't see it sucking in bustling city streets.  That isn't to say there isn't some major damage brought to bear in this film - it's just not as extreme as you might be expecting.  In fact, the special effects are one of the more effective aspects of The Void.  It's just too bad the script doesn't rise to the occasion.  This could have been much more than the exceedingly average film that it is.",1315094400,2,3275,4.707017543859649
1706968,3,B000064927,"Adrian Paul has lost it since his first 5 seasons of Highlander.  Hard to believe this is the same actor.  He needs to find some cool roles where he is the hero who makes next to no mistakes and comes out on top.  Season 6 of the Highlander and the crap movies that followed brought him down.  I only bought this because of Amanda Tapping.  It seems like the Stargate cast, Highlander, Sanctuary, and various others in the Vancouver film making area are hanging out together and producing whatever they can.  This movie had potential, but I am disappointed.  I really liked Adrian's old Duncan McLeod character and he just needs to find a role like that again.  He has the potential to play the James Bond role.  He just needs to find better scripts.",1281916800,,750,4.496296296296296
1706969,5,B000064927,"This movie ""The Void"" keeps you on the edge of your seat.

1706972,1,B000064927,"I bought this movie for 2 reasons: 1) because it has Amanda Tapping in it, and 2) its Sci-Fi. The cover is as B-grade as the movie unfortunately. The acting was awful, and so much more could have been done with the storyline. The science behind the story was very interesting though. I'm not sorry I bought it, I love Sci-fi whether its good or bad. Bad movies help you appreciate the good ones :)",1222128000,4,397,4.306666666666667
1706973,2,B000064927,"The Void is a cheap-looking by-the-book science fiction movie that offers little in the way of originality.  The plot focuses on the standard mad scientist (played by Malcolm McDowell) who will not let anything get in the way of his pursuit of cheap energy through the contained use of a black hole.  The first time he tried it, many people were killed, and now eight years later, he is out to re-try his experiment on a bigger scale.

Amanda Tapping (of Stargate fame) plays a physicist who's also the daughter of a man killed in the original experiment.  She determines that this experiment is not only doomed to fail but could wipe out the Earth in the process.  With her engineer boyfriend (Adrian Paul, from the Highlander series), she tries to stop the impending disaster, all the while avoiding killers in the mad scientist's employ.

With a story right out of the Science Fiction Clichs Manual, tepid writing and not much in the way of special effects, this movie is skippable.  It has the look of a made-for-TV movie with the exception of some minor nudity (with the use of an obvious body double).  In fact, right down to the second-tier science fiction actors, this appears to merely be a cynical attempt to lure unsuspecting science fiction fans into buying or renting a movie with absolutely nothing original.",1127174400,26,1322,4.767543859649122
1706974,3,B000064927,"The only reason I bought this movie was because I am a devoted AT fan and was not disappointed with her performance at all.  She sucessfully pulls off a seemingly stagnant role without imitating her alter ego Samantha Carter.  It was refreshing to see her in a new role.

The movie was fairly good but not fantastic.  One that you can only see once or twice.  Malcolm McDowell was great, as per usual and Adrian Paul was good.  Overall, an unbelievable and unrealistic movie but perfect for that sci-fi junkie.

The plot outcome was predictable but that didn't stop a little angst seeping through.  Not edge-of-your-seat but good enough.  Almost cliched but good enough performances make it acceptable.  However, partly ignre the blurb on the back because I doesn't quite make sense.  Who is Kat Hicks?

FYO - In the second sex scene the raunchy parts are actually a body double, not Amanda Tapping, called Miranda Hermanson.  Also, for those SG-1 fans, note Dan Shea's name in the credits.",1102982400,16,990,4.78698224852071

OK, the movie features two very good-looking characters, played by Tapping and Adrian ""Highlander"" Paul, but ""The Void"" feels more like 90 hours than 90 minutes long.  I gave it two stars because it has Malcolm Macdowall, who always plays a great villian.  However, you should avoid this movie at all costs.",1066521600,4,527,4.833333333333333
1706977,3,B000064927,"First, just to make it clear to those thousands and thousands globally who see an R-rated movie starring Amanda Tapping and expect to see more of her than usual, the answer is yes and no.  The shots that merited an ""R"" use a body-double who is listed in the credits and is not artfully edited into the scene.
Second, expecting an understandable plot about ""black hole"" physics is asking a lot more than a 90-minute made-for-TV (?) can deliver.  Still, it moves along as well as can be expected and gives a somewhat different Amanda than appears on Stargate SG-1.
Disappointments include the effects, which appear cheap, and the music, which comes off cheaper.
All that said, as an AT fan, I'm glad I bought the movie.  Adrian Paul comes off well and Malcom McDowell again plays a villian, although not an entirely unsympathetic one.
