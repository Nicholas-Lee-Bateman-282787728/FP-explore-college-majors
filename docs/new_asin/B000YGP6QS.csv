I just received my replacement from Amazon and it is the same problem. ""The media you have inserted is not DVD encoded"" I have popped this into HDDVD player, 3 standard def DVD players and 2 Mac optical drives and get the same thing every time or just have the disc spit back out.

3028939,1,B000YGP6QS,"From Bandai's web site:

January 9, 2008 (Cypress, CA) - Bandai Entertainment Inc. announced today that a number of its January titles were defective as a result of a duplicator's error which created playability issues on some DVD consoles and personal computers. The titles in question are: Gundam Seed Destiny Vol. 12 regular and special editions, Eureka Seven Vol. 11, Flag Vol. 2, and My Otome Vol. 4.

3028940,2,B000YGP6QS,"The final four episodes of the Gundam Seed Destiny franchise are a must see; however, if the DVD does not work, it is a real mess. It is nice to see how Gundam Destiny gets owned by the Justice of Athrun. The same goes for the Freedom as it shuts down the Legend, and lastly, the Archangel sinking the Minerva, but the freakin DVD kept on skipping like crazy.

When you look at bottom part of the DVD, it is scratch free, but somehow it is skipping on major parts that is a must see. One example is the maneuver of the Archangel against the Minerva, then suddenly skip, and the Minerva is down. Wait, did I blink my eyes? I made a slow rewind then the dvd stopped a bit and hanged for a bit. It did that for a considerable amount of time, and I still fail to see that scene. It is very disappointing.

I exchanged the damn thing for another and the same goes for that too. I exchanged again and again and still it was happening like a bad cold. What the hell did Bandai do with the DVD?

Another point is that some portions are missing, such as the part when Lacus becomes a big whig in the Plants, and Cagali somehow leading the peoples of Earth, but those scenes are nowhere in this one. Those scenes bring some closure to the Gundam Seed Destiny saga, but those are not in there at all.

I do not know what is Bandai trying to pull here? The final four episodes are what the fans are waiting for, which includes me. But, the technical aspects are what makes watching it frustrating.

In summation, the storyline is strong and the characters really do shine. The gundam fights and the battleship to battleship bouts are really awesome and fun to watch minus the part when the DVD skips, as if the producers are giving the fans a middle finger. Furthermore, the battleship maneuvers are splendidly done, and the major gundam fights are awesome, but the DVD itself performed horribly.",1199750400,,1884,4.356125356125356

So I tried using different players and even my computer to watch this DVD but the final chapters of the disc is just not playable. I even tried downloading a freeware player thinking it might solve the problem. It somewhat did the trick but the performance was very choppy to say the least.

After browsing the web, I discovered that there was a manufacturing error regarding this DVD title (along with 3 other titles). Bandai entertainment has confirmed a recall and is willing to exchange already purchased disc with newly replicated ones. [...].

The writers of this series thought they were allowed an additional 10 episodes.  Many items were left out including the upgrade to the Atakasuki, the transfer of half the crew from the Arch Angel to the Eternal, and the final peace agreement between the plants and Orb/Earth Alliance. The final 2 chapters were very choppy.  I was able to buy FINAL DESTINY the Director's Cut and it was a bit better.  I will not ruin the actual ending for you but the final several scenes were very different which includes Athrun in the final confrontation.  What also is important in the director's cut is some very important CLOSURE for Shinn including the hand shake between Kira and Shinn.

8232732,5,B000YGP6QS,"Gundam seed is one of the more modernized Gundam entries. The 2 previous shows, Gundam wing and 08th MS Team were pretty good. Gundam Wing had okay animation, but the voice cast was bad on the english dub. 08th MS Team has ok voice acting, but the animation was kind rough. Gundam Seed has neither of these problems. It has really good animation and pretty good voice acting. The soundtrack is also really well done. The story is also more interesting. There are some major plot twists and some great conflicts between the characters. It definitely deserves the 2 seasons that it ran. With lots of great characters, a pretty in depth plot and high quality production it's definitely my favorite Gundam since the original. You should give it a chance.

Neither plot devices nor character development is well constructed.  And worst of all, Episode 50 had NO CLOSURE.  To get the real ending, one has to get the extended FINAL PLUS episode, slated for release in March.

To add insult to injury, Bandai screwed up Disc 12.  All you get is a ""Oh, we're sorry"".  I was well informed on the recall issue, but other unsuspecting buyers went to the store for exchange 2 to 3 times.  What about the hassle caused, Bandai?  I'd say at least give a discount coupon for FINAL PLUS for the hassle.  Gas to drive back and forth is anything but free, and neither is postage...and time wasted.",1201392000,,824,4.551020408163265
