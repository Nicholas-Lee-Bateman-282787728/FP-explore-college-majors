8743821,5,B01943T7QQ,I love most Nora Roberts that have been made into movies.  This one does not disappoint and Melissa Gilbert delivers as always an amazing job.  The onscreen chemistry between her and Mandalor is great.,1527465600,,201,4.882352941176471
8743822,4,B01943T7QQ,"Ordered it from amazon, but the sound is unfortunately still too low. Nevertheless it's a pretty good TV thriller based on Nora Roberts' novel.

I like Melissa Gilbert and have quite a collection of her TV movies.
However, the costume designer of ""Sanctuary"" must have been color blind: you cannot wear red, pink or purple when you have red hair. It just doesn't fit.",1524787200,,367,4.734375

8743826,5,B01943T7QQ,"I don't do ""Manufactured On Demand"" films, as it makes me feel like I'm watching a prohibited copy. However, to see this film again, I chanced it and bought the MOD, DVD-R copy sold here, by Amazon itself, and I was very pleasantly surprised that the disc quality was so high, for an older program. The quality was on par with pressed discs of the late 1990s and early 2000s, before HD masters were being remastered in 2K and then used to make 480 copies that upscaled so much better due to the increased efforts of the digital restoration artists removing blemishes and the like from the film. This has some blemishes, some issues inherent with not having been remastered, or cleaned up, as it were, but still looks very good on an HD screen and upscales nicely. The film is complete, as I remembered it, and plays perfectly in spite of being a DVD-R copy. Well done to Amazon on this one. We really appreciated it.",1515456000,3,916,4.491017964071856
8743827,4,B01943T7QQ,"It is a LMN movie and there are noticeable differences from the novel; however, I loved Melissa Gilbert's performance.  If you are a fan of the Nora Robert's movie series then this is a must have for your collection.  Definitely 1 of my 2 favorite (the other be Carolina Moon).",1505347200,,277,4.52
8743828,5,B01943T7QQ,I love Nora Roberts I have all of the released DVDs and sanctuary is just thrilling from start to finish,1502150400,,104,4.25
