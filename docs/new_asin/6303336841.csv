7845690,5,6303336841,"I wish I had paid more attention to the words in my review title. NON-USA FORMAT! It cannot be played on your average USA bought DVD player. The seller was kind enough to refund my money though which I am very grateful for. I only had to pay for the return shipping. I will be more cautious in the future in regards to Format. Seller was very flexible and I will look to them for other rare and foreign titles, paying closer attention to the Format.",1339804800,,449,4.232558139534884
7845691,1,6303336841,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen! And the book sucks to! I think if anything it makes poor people look like scum! I grew up poor, but cannot relate to any of the stuff that the beans go through. The movie is really bad, but also really hillarious. So if you are lookin for a great laugh check out Forbidden Choices, and the book The Beans of Egypt Maine.",1141948800,3,362,4.041666666666667
7845692,5,6303336841,"The Beans of Egypt, Maine aka Forbidden Choices was a major part of my childhood because when I was 5 years old I was indeed a Bean of Egypt, Maine. The movie was filmed in Washington, but I don't remember where and it was a great experience. The movie itself is a bit off, but something interesting about the movie and the book is it is based of of Beal Island in Maine, and there is lots of incest there. Beal was one of the main characters in the movie, who was sleeping with his aunt played by Kelly Lynch. Its a great story if you want to get into it.",1140393600,4,556,4.018018018018018
7845693,3,6303336841,"This film based on Carolyn Chute's novel ""The Beans of Egypt, Maine""  sports some good performances, but it's choppy as all get-out.  It was actually filmed under that title and was broadcast on PBS's ""American Playhouse.""  The title change and lack of publicity suggests that the current marketing strategy is to distance the film from its vaguely ""arty"" and literary origins.  The same kind of mentality that turned Paul Newman's version of Kesey's ""Sometimes a Great Notion"" into ""Never Give an Inch,""  (Does someone in marketing really think these are catchier titles?)
As a native of Maine, I always cringe when screen actors attempt their version of a Downeast accent.  They always seem to think that Maine is part of Appalachia or something.  Accent-wise, no one here is quite as bad as Marisa Tomei was in ""In the Bedroom,"" and I know this was a low-budget production and all, but even small theater groups have dialect coaches.  Oddly enough, Dutch-born Rutger Hauer seems to it pull off most handily.
If anyone would like my services in this department, I'll offer them cheap!  For starters, think Boston with a slight rural twang.  Think of those old Pepperidge Farm commercials.  And most of all, keep in mind that ""auntie"" is pronounced ""ahntie"" not ""anti.""
Other than the faltering accents, the acting is pretty good.  Kelly Lynch, Martha Plimpton and the aformentioned Rutger Hauer head a strong cast.  But this is one of those films where you'll come away convinced that the book was better even if you haven't read the book.
That's glib, I know, but it's just another way of saying that some stories cry for more detail and development than your typical film treatment can give.  This would appear to be one of them.",1025913600,5,1733,4.850340136054422
