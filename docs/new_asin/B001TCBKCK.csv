More importantly, this film was great!  Entertaining and insightful, I would highly recommend this documentary to anyone who is interested in New Orleans' culture.  An often overlooked and especially charming bit of southern society is highlighted here along with an intriguing peek at the history and lore that created it. I especially loved the old film clips and photographs that were used to illustrate the long and rich heritage behind this elegant tradition.  Great seller, great film!!  I highly recommend it!",1239235200,2,558,5.306818181818182
