2610930,5,B000GGS0VY,"I love working with the bands. I have worked out with Kira in her classes with the bands and the resistance training is great. It works you a little harder is some areas than just using weights. Its great, give it a try.",1151625600,12,220,4.1395348837209305
2610931,1,B000GGS0VY,"Save your money! This DVD is so slow paced and BORING! If you're someone who likes a fast paced and enthusiastic workout WITH MUSIC.....this is NOT for you! I wish I would have read Anastasia's review before wasting my money on this! It is overpriced! For almost $20.00, it should at least include music. Even if Kira couldn't get the rights to published music, she should have found someone to create music specifically for the workout.",1199059200,,437,4.7631578947368425
2610932,1,B000GGS0VY,"If you like music with your work out this is not the DVD for you. We know what muscle groups are getting the work out, but my enthusiasm for the work out gets burst by the dull instruction.",1197849600,3,189,4.0
2610933,4,B000GGS0VY,"I found this to be a good, solid workout; she's never too fast or slow.  Each time I work out I hear a little something new that makes my workout better.",1193616000,,153,3.935483870967742
2610934,5,B000GGS0VY,"I love this DVD and bring it with me every time I travel.  I always feel like I get a great workout and it's easy to bring bands with me in my suitcase.  I can do the workout in my hotel room and have privacy and space that I don't always have in the hotel gym.

This bands workout is very comprehensive and I always feel like certain muscles get worked that somehow get forgotten with other workouts.  Great job, Kira, and keep those DVDs coming!",1189036800,4,447,4.162790697674419
2610935,1,B000GGS0VY,I was under the impression that Bands would be included. That was not the case so needless to say I was deeply disappointed!,1184198400,2,124,4.434782608695652
2610936,4,B000GGS0VY,Add this title to your workout rotation. Great workout in less than 30 minutes.,1178928000,4,79,4.714285714285714
2610937,4,B000GGS0VY,"I was pleased with this workout video, it is slow paced but efficient..",1173312000,7,71,4.538461538461538
2610938,5,B000GGS0VY,Bands are an easy and convenient way to get in shape. Kira's video is a great way to tone up and help lose weight. The band workout is easy to follow and understand. I love that I can take the band anywhere and still get in a workout! I would recommend this workout to anyone regardless of fitness level.,1152921600,22,304,4.169491525423729
2610939,5,B000GGS0VY,"I came across Kira's DVDs while I was pregnant and have now tried almost all of them. The workouts are tough, yet easy to follow. She provides fantastic harder alternatives, but even the ""easier"" version hurts like heck! The bands are amazing, and work muscles that you miss when using just weights. Buy, buy, buy this DVD!",1152576000,25,323,4.684210526315789
2610940,5,B000GGS0VY,"I have another of Kira Langolf's workout dvds and really enjoy it. When I saw this one, I was excited about working with resistance bands. Everything burns and gets worked in this workout! I particulary like the innovative exercises for hamstrings and glutes in this DVD! Resistance bands are so easy to take anywhere and are very effective! I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a change of pace and a solid body sculpting program!",1152576000,22,444,4.779220779220779

8131960,2,B000GGS0VY,"Jerky filming, no music.  A home made attempt to make money.  There were even people walking behind the person exercising, just strolling down the beach!",1389916800,,153,5.08
8131961,5,B000GGS0VY,"I had been looking everywhere for a dvd that focused primarily on exercises with resistance bands when I came across this. This dvd really gives you a pretty good workout if you do the total body tone. I like that there was no cheezy music in the background and the host was actually doing the exercises with you the whole time. Some of the sections are a bit choppy but what does that have to do with the workout being effective. I am looking forward to purchasing Got Bands 2 and I hope that it will be as great as this one. Bottom line if you want an effective workout without all the cheezy music and fake hosts buy this dvd. (Resistance band NOT included, my advice would be to go for a shorter band if you are not a tall person.)",1301443200,,735,4.183098591549296
8131962,3,B000GGS0VY,"I thought I was getting the bands, my mistake probably when I looked closer it did have dvd written rather small I think but anyway guess you will get another sale now that I have the dvd and not the bands.

Thanks Deb",1296000000,,218,4.069767441860465
8131963,5,B000GGS0VY,"I found Kira through iTunes (fitgirl podcast) and am hooked!  Her knowledge of nutrition and exercise really shows.  I used to be a personal trainer and Kira's workouts still give me a run for my money!  She really knows how to get the most effective workout for everyone from beginners to experts.  The bands especially are a great, affordable, and effective thing to do at home.",1254268800,,380,4.712121212121212
8131964,4,B000GGS0VY,She's easy to follow and being able to break up your workout is nice for those times when you don't have time to do the whole thing.,1252972800,,132,3.925925925925926
8131965,1,B000GGS0VY,"I don't know if the reviewers who gave this dvd a great review got the same dvd I did?! But quite frankly, I can't understand where they are coming from after thoroughly reviewing this dvd. If there were a minus 5 rating, I would give it to this dvd.

Firstly, the footage looks like it was shot and edited by a total amateur - something you and your buddy would try to put together on a weekend. The segments cut off and start abruptly. Also, oddly, while the product description says there is no music because most viewers find it distacting, I was very much distracted by the activity going on in the background - birds swimming on a lake, someone walking next to the water and looking to see what the heck is going on, and amusingly, someone walking their dog and repeatedly throwing things in the water for the dog to retrieve. The things going on in the background are actually much more interesing than the resistance band instruction which is very slow and boring.

Secondly, I was extremely disappointed to the point of feeling completely scammed to find that while this dvd purports to have 6 workouts (3 main ones, and 3 combo ones), there is actually only one 10 minute resistance band workout which repeats 6 times. At first I thought maybe I kept accidentally selecting the same workout, but then I realized that it really is the same workout repeated 6 times, with the workout switched around a bit. Complete and total scam!!!",1237075200,29,1441,4.5813953488372094
8131966,5,B000GGS0VY,"I love the fact that this does NOT have music. She has excellent instructions. She also gives you different levels of progression.

I love her little humor every once in a while. It isn't corny. Just good fun.

Very basic...just what I wanted!",1234483200,2,243,4.627906976744186
8131967,5,B000GGS0VY,"My workouts were recently altered due to a car accident. I couldn't do my regular weight routines; so I thought I would try Got Bands.  I love it! I find that I have much more control with the bands and to my surprise, I get a good workout. Kira is a very good instuctor and emphasis is on form, which I like. I liked the first DVD so much that I bought the 2nd one.  I can even get rows in with the bands.

If you are looking for a good strength workout without going to the gym or buying a ton of equipment; this is it.",1212451200,4,521,3.850467289719626
8131968,5,B000GGS0VY,"I currently own a Bowflex and use it quite regularly but wanted to add something new to my routine as doing the same thing over and over gets boring.

I have to say that I got one heck of a workout with this DVD. I like the fact that Kira explains the various exercises as she goes and also the fact that there is no corny/annoying music to distract you. I didn't buy this DVD to be entertained, I bought it help me get into shape.

I highly recommend the DVD, one word of advice...get yourself a few bands varying in resistance so you can switch them out as your strength increases.

Now...let me address some of the negative reviews left here.

For the person complaining about being ""misled"" that bands were not included, perhaps you should read the review/description were it clearly states ""Bands are not included with this DVD"".

For the two people who complained about the fact there is no music on the DVD, like I said above, perhaps you should read the review/description were it clearly states ""Music is not added to this workout.""",1206057600,10,1041,4.51595744680851
