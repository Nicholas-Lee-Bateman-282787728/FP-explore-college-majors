531281,4,6302999804,"Just One of the Girls is a surprisingly good movie. Corey Haim, who plays Chris Calder, is a 16 year old kid interested in the music profession and, ofcourse, girls. Only his crush, played by Nicole Eggert, has a brother  who's looking to stomp Calder(Haim) into the ground, so Calder has to dress  as a girl to avoid this beating and in so doing becomes a cheereader and  best friends with his crush. Calder now has to stay focused on school, his  music aspirations, staying away from his bully, cheerleading, and his  crush, as if that were not enough, he has to do it all as a girl. No  problem!",912124800,15,598,4.390909090909091

7833614,5,6302999804,"If you have not seen this movie you are truly missing out. It is a 80's style comedy but It does live up to the test of time. Its loaded with smoking hot chicks, The acting is solid and basically you will laugh throughout the movie.

This movie prettymuch has it all for a comedy.

Youll like the shower scene as well.... TRUST ME!!!!!!!1",1209945600,,338,4.265625

7833616,4,6302999804,"I first saw this film in Sky Movies in 1994. It was a funny childish film to watch, and do recommend buying this film. Corey Hame one of the last 80's teen actors, plays a boy who undercovers as a woman to get by in high school. So if you were around in the early 90's and loved to have fun, this one's for you darling.",1127260800,,319,3.8484848484848486
7833617,5,6302999804,"I remember this movie back in 1992, and really liked it.  It's one of the last '80s style teen comedies.  Corey Haim does a great job playing the role of a girl trying to get away from a bully, then befriends the bully's sister.  Alanis Morrisette also makes a cameo appearance towards the end of the movie and sings one of her earlier dance tunes.  It's a great movie if you are in the mood for some light entertainment.",1003363200,3,421,4.291139240506329
7833618,4,6302999804,"I have to tell you that I am a huge fan of Corey Haim so I rented this movie. I expected it to be corny and cheesy, but I really enjoyed it! I think you should get this movie because of great comedy and of course,  COREY! Nicole Eggert is in it as well so if you are a fan of hers, you will  enjoy this movie too!",927936000,3,313,3.588235294117647
