189835,5,1572524537,"This DVD is a great companion to ""Max Fleischer's Superman  (1943).""  I am so happy to finally have to complete collection on DVD.  I have owned to cartoons in various formats over the years, and this is  the best I have ever seen.  Short cartoons really lend themselves to the  DVD format, as you can select the episode you want to watch without having  to fast forward.
These cartoons are great, although they are a very  different flavor from the first set.  Here, World War Two is in full swing  and Superman is more likely to battle Nazis and the Japanese than Mad  Scientist. He also tends to be a bit more destructive.  There is more of a  darker feel to these ""Lost Episodes.""
The animation is top  quality, and the use of shadows and color is beautiful.  America has never  had a better animator than the legendary Max Fleischer .  Great color  restoration, and the sound quality is just fine. My only complaint, as with  ""Max Fleischer's Superman (1943),"" is the bonus features, which  are not really features but adds for other tapes in the collection. The  nice thing about it is you don't have to watch them. IT does come with a  picture disk, which is cool.  I am very happy with this DVD.",965001600,8,1203,4.467592592592593
189836,3,1572524537,"When the Fleischer Brothers left Paramount and the Superman Carottns, Paramount decided to let another company do the next series of 5 minute animatd shorts.  While the look of Superman has been updated here to the  40s (The Fleischers looked more 20s) the animation isn't quite up to par  and the sense of wonder that filled the first series is also missing.  However what is most bothersome about these cartoons is that they are  blatant WWII propaganda, and very little else, I can understand the racist  and jingoistic stereotypes and to a certain degree I can attribute it to  the war and the needs of war, but that doesn't mean I like it and it  honestly doesn't sit well with me.  Interestingly the Fleischers NEVER got  as nasty as this series even when they did have characters of differnt  nationalities.
Honestly if you want to see these and really do the old  cartoons justice get the first set (The Fleischer not the lost episodes)  and you will see something truly remarkable, not just product.",951523200,3,1008,4.724137931034483
189837,3,1572524537,"This video, along with ""Max Fleischer's Superman"", is visually, the finest collection of these cartoons yet released. However, what holds  this video back from a 5 star rating is the sound. The ""enhanced""  (overdubbed) sound presented here is completely out of place in a 1940's  cartoon. Along with the enhancements, it seems bass was added to the  remaining ""unenhanced"" sound, making everything else sounds like  it was recorded in a tin can. For me, the juxtoposition between the  ultra-realistic enhancements and the rest of the ""tin can' sound is  unnerving. Getting past the sound however, I cannot stress enough how well  these cartoon were made. At the time these were made (1941-1943), they were  the most expensive cartoon shorts ever produced, costing upwards of 50 to  90 thousand dollars each. The quality of the animation is incredible! I  have yet to see any cartoon by any studio that has impressed me as much as  these. The picture quality of this video is also very good. The colors are  crisp and clear, which helps to show off the stunning animation. As long as  you can live with the altered sound, I highly recommend this collection. If  you are a fan of Superman, Animation, or the Fleischer's you must own this  video1",940982400,8,1243,4.847619047619047
7797795,5,1572524537,"Another great release by Winstar/Audio Galaxy, this time with the Famous Studios ""Superman"" shorts, which look and sound better than any other release out there. These shorts were produced after the whole Fleischer Studios incident and are primarily wartime shorts, and some may argue, subtle propaganda. Some may find some of these films offensive, but are significant in gaining a clearer understanding of the times they were in. Unlike the Fleischer shorts, there really is no stand out shorts, save for ""Japoteurs"" and ""The Mummy Strikes"". As a bonus, as we have come to expect from Audio Galaxy, we get extensive liner notes about each cartoon and the series as a whole, and we also get a bonus short, the Terrytoons film ""Wolf,Wolf"" starring Mighty Mouse, which has also been fully restored and enhanced. Another great release, buy it today.",1413331200,,847,5.057142857142857

7797797,3,1572524537,"Comparing these episodes to new animation is like comparing a bicycle to a space shuttle. Obviously, these cartoons are not as good as todays', say Titan AE or Batman: The animated series. But comparing this to their contemporaries, this is really fantastic.
So if you are a Superman fan, but not an animation fan, get this. It's like getting a piece of history.
Too bad, I got this DVD before the Complete Episode series came out. Check out the other DVD before buying this one. You'll get more of the same price.",1059955200,9,514,4.5978260869565215

7797799,5,1572524537,"I do not own this DVD or any other Superman DVD.  A co-worker of mine has ""Max Fleischers Superman"" on DVD.  this was release several years ago.  It contains all the episodes that do not appear on ""The Lost Episodes"". TLE was produced to finish the series for those owning the older DVD.  Do not buy both this and the complete set as recommended by Borders/amazon.com If you don't have the old release, you won't nead TLE. Just get the complete DVD.",1045094400,9,449,4.439024390243903
7797800,5,1572524537,"I'm not a particularly enthusiastic fan of Superman or animation, but I must say these movies are a real treat. The restoration is impressive, with vivid colors, clean lines and nice (if sometimes rather artificial) sound. The original artwork is, as has been described elsewhere, excellent.
Some noise has been made about insensitve racial content. Well, during the second World War the propoganda machine was in full swing. We refered the Japanese with words that today make us cringe. These items are cultural artifacts and are wisely left unexpurgated. Just as we must leave ""Huckleberry Finn"" un-Bowdlerized we must leave these WW II cartoons alone as well. Censorship is the enemy of art.
While you can observe these cartoons as historical snapshots, you can also just sit back and have fun with them. This 40's era Superman is a lot more human than the modern version; it takes some effort, for example, to stop a plummetting airliner, or rip away a steel door. The stories are fairly snappy, and they make for entertaining viewing. At this price, you ought to just order the darn thing.",1038787200,4,1094,4.918918918918919
7797801,5,1572524537,"If you've already purchased the ""Complete Superman Cartoons"", there is no need for you to purchase this particular DVD.  If you've already purchased ""Complete..."", you already have all of the ""lost"" items that are on this DVD.",1023667200,67,226,5.108108108108108
7797802,1,1572524537,"This Audio Galaxy product is a mixture of good to bad prints: some may be from videotape sources, or worn 16mm TV-station reduction prints instead of the original film.
Calling these 8 Fleischer studio cartoons ""Lost Episodes"" is merely a marketing ploy, since none of these have ever been lost, and have been floating around on public-domain ""kid-vid"" VHS tapes for the last 15 years. Audio Galaxy does try some padding with ""complete credits, production notes..."" etc., but there's nothing really compellng. You could look most of this stuff up on the Internet. Because this is only eight of the Superman cartoons, younger viewers may get an unbalanced picture of the series due to two of the titles, ""Japoteurs"" and ""Jungle Drums"" relying on blatantly racist stereotypes, reflecting the sensibilites of the mid-40's and WWII era in which they were produced.
The better bet would be to purchase another DVD Collection, ""Complete Superman Cartoons: Diamond Anniversary Edition,"" which I'm sure you can locate discounted from it's MSRP ... On that disc you will find the whole catalog of all 17 Fleischer studio Superman cartoons (including the 8 titles on the Audio Galaxy disc), many in pristine condition,
with all the same additional features. If there are any more than this 17 I have not yet found them. ...",1018051200,10,1313,5.027522935779817
7797803,4,1572524537,"Superman's first major visit to the big screen is finally captured on DVD and preserved.  This DVD is the project of WinStar, not Paramount.  I don't think Paramount in any way even sanctioned this or their logo would appear somewhere in the viewing of the DVD.
Be aware!  This is not the full collection of the Fleischer cartoons.  Only the eight episodes produced by Famous Studios are on it.  The Episodes included are:
1) Jap O Tears
2) Showdown
3) Eleventh Hour
4) Destruction Inc.
5) The Mummy Strikes
6) Jungle Drums
7) Underground World
8) Secret Agent
If you want the full collection or the rest of the collection you'll have to purchase the DVD's listed below:
Complete Superman Cartoons: Diamond Anniversary Edition
The Superman Cartoons of Max and Dave Fleischer
Max Fleischer's Superman/ Superman: The Lost Episodes
(For all the episodes)
Superman (1998) (For the other nine not on this DVD)
All are available here at Amazon.
This restoration is a very noble attempt.  The film is very much cleaned up and more enjoyable to watch.  The colors, particularly the reds, are very vibrant now.  Images hard to make out on older VHS copies are now crystal clear.  The sound quality is another story, however.  You can choose three different sound settings: Dolby Digital, Dolby Pro Logic, and Stereo.  They all still sound like they're in a can to me.  In fact, when you watch the restoration demo on the DVD the sound beforehand is cleaner and clearer than the restored sound, in my opinion.  New sound effects have been blended with the old ones.  Try to picture the old sound effects (in a can) blended with digitally crisp ones.  Do you see my point?  They do not blend very well and that can be distracting.
I'm not trying to talk you out of buying this product, just be aware of what you're buying.
Bonuses for this DVD:
It's a DVD and will never wear out - That's a bonus in itself.
It does have a very interesting history of the Fleischer Studios and the all the Superman shorts they created.
It also has the very first ""Mighty Mouse"" short that is known of included on it.  You'll note that Mighty Mouse's colors were different.
This is a worthy investment if you're like me and love any and all things that are Superman related.",1004400000,19,2245,4.628787878787879
