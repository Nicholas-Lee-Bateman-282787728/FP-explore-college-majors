8512917,3,B0079K4XC0,"this movie had all the pieces in place to be an amazing movie.. i don't give it away but if i knew how it ended
i wouldn't have wasted the time to watch it.  As an American it will leave you disappointed in both characters,
and a little less faith in society...

i would say skip it...",1471737600,,285,3.982456140350877

The ending leaves you wondering what the hell actually happens next-- which was invigorating to me and very upsetting to my boyfriend.

Enjoy this dark french film which is a doozie.",1467936000,,436,4.425

8512922,5,B0079K4XC0,"Excellent contemporary commentary on modern banking and finance system. It is no chance the main female character is called ""France"", she represents all the average people of France, stuffed around by bankers. She is the average employee, citizen. Her boss in Paris is the average selfish, destructive banker, his only loyalties are to money and himself. It could be anywhere in Europe, the UK or USA. Made in 2010 after the GFC, the bankers destroyed France's factory and thus her job, so she has to leave her children to go to Paris to survive. He screws women and businesses for selfish reasons.
Later, the factory workers and France herself fight back, against the banker and the police. The scene of them chanting ""France, France"" is a wonderful call to protest for the whole Western system. In this case, France the person represents France as a nation of ideals which is being screwed over by bankers and authorities, and France and her workmates start to rise up and resist in anger. The filmmaker is stirring up these awarenesses in the audience, a wake up call to fight back, as France as a nation. France's smile at the end says it all.
This film should be shown in Western nations every night after austerity measures are announced. For example, now in the UK while the bedroom tax is being introduced to UK citizens in government housing. That would be a beautiful use of the film. Its ideas extend beyond France, to international systems, and can relate to any nation undergoing bail outs for banks and austerity measures due to those bail outs.
A surprising little gem of a film, using very accessible and real characters to depict a complex recent social situation we have all lived through.",1362873600,2,1707,4.7898305084745765
8512923,5,B0079K4XC0,"I'd never heard of the film, the director, or the actors.  The opening credits gave me pause.  My idea of a good French film is one set either in the charming old streets of Paris or the luscious fields of Provence.  This had neither.  We're shown a struggling, single mother, with her dark roots showing under her frizzy hair, who has just lost her job at the docks in Dunkirk.  Then we see the other side of life in Paris...a financier with the morals of a snake lives and works in glossy opulence.  It happens that he is one of the brains who has shut down her factory.  As luck would have it, she ends up working as his housekeeper, and then as an impromptu nanny. Her humanity is a constant contrast to his scuzziness and yet the chemistry that builds up between them keeps you guessing.

This is a smart film, not predictable, with a lot of heart.  It's moralistic but certainly not grim or preachy; every scene is enjoyable.  The cast is perfect.  Gilles Lellouche is the embodiment of rich scum and yet, at times, we hope for his redemption.  Karen Viardi, who is interestingly named ""France"" is wonderful as the heroine. The ending made me cheer and cry.  This is a sleeper which I hope gets a bigger audience in the US. I highly recommend it.  I'm going to look up more of this director's work.",1349136000,3,1304,4.401673640167364
8512924,5,B0079K4XC0,"This film surprised me and what a delight it was along the way. I thought I was headed for a quirked-out French romance. I'm so proud right now [of this production] I can hardly write the review. I'm sorry if it's not a masterpiece. My mind is still caught up in the happenings on the streets of Dunkirk.

A factory closes, negatively affecting the people of Dunkirk. A well-loved worker, in order to support her children, commutes between Paris and home, seeking domestic work. Meanwhile, a wealthy trader used to a Paris/London commute, is looking for a maid. Unexpected events follow.

The plot was meticulous and engrossing, appropriately diverse and never slow.

If you are or ever were a fan of the Hitchcock 1h series, this titillating film will make you smile. It's real-life Hitchcock, with the life breathed into it-- like Alfred would have done it now and it is BEAUTIFUL. The viewer is left with more to talk about after the film ends, just like the best episodes of the Hitchcock era. My Piece of the Pie was amazingly well executed.

Congratulations are due to all involved, but special kudos to the cinematographer [Narrow life = narrow views, expanded heart = wider shots]. Kudos to the director -- seamless, immaculate work! The performances were pristine, raw. So beautifully cast, each character had depth peppered with just enough humanity to keep us guessing.

I loved it all. I think you will agree.",1342915200,3,1421,4.8312757201646095
