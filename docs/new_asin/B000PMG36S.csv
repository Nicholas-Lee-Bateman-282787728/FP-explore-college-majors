8192737,5,B000PMG36S,"Fatima-The Altar of the World is an excellent DVD of the events and Message given at Fatima, Portugal, during six apparitions in May through October 1917, to three little shepherd children, Lucia dos Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto. For those who are not familiar with Fatima, this is DVD that you should own.  I recommended it very highly.",1382486400,,359,4.885245901639344
8192738,4,B000PMG36S,I thought that this DVD gave a good historical background on Fatima and the events which occurred there.  I enjoyed it.,1364774400,,119,4.666666666666667
8192739,5,B000PMG36S,"I have been to Fatima and seen the area on a trip visiting my family.  To see the place where this event took place, seeing the cathedral, and seeing where two of the children were buried. Reality hits you when you see this place in person.  One may not believe this event, but an amazing story and how Catholics have an intense belief this event was factual event.
There are events in our world we can never explain with logic, but have to go on faith that certain events just happen.",1358640000,,485,4.318681318681318
8192740,4,B000PMG36S,"This dvd covers the basics of the story of the Fatima apparitions of 1917 but adds info about the Basilica and shrine grounds which isn't usually discussed in Fatima dvds.  It's a simple presentation but in the end it is yet another nice tribute to Our Lady of Fatima, Mother of Christ.",1245801600,3,286,4.5
8192741,2,B000PMG36S,"it is more of a political documentary. does not add anything more to the baffling events of 1917 that the enthusiast already knows. the political side i am not so interested in, perhaps the post-event historical aspects are quite well mentioned here. somewhat disappointed in the lack of the materials surrounding the remarkable events...kt",1224979200,,340,5.314814814814815
