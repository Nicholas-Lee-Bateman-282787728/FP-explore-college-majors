8636070,5,B004VGGYOK,"Timber Gang is the striking story of lumberjacks in Northeast China on one final expedition. Yu Guangyi spent months with these lumberjacks and his digital video provides a story that can rarely be seen. Their expedition is always in the winter because it is easier for the horses to drag massive trees over ice. This film shows the unlikely courage of these men and some odd rituals that are part of their society. I can guarantee this movie experience is unlike any you will see, and is well worth your time.",1303084800,,510,4.615384615384615
