8496713,1,B006DHAT14,"This sounded like a really cooL premise, and I was all revved up to love it. HOWever, this is filmed in what I'll call Darko-Vision for some reason, and everything takes place in the dark. The acting is awful and the story takes a wonderful idea and reduces it to utter senselessness. If that's not bad enough, they give actual lines to about a three-four year old child, as believeable as pork chops in Arabia.

  am giving this a wide ""miss."" I quit when the hero attacked a chick reporter for asking about his murdered wife---utterly absurd, even allowing for cultural differences.",1377734400,,584,4.705882352941177

8496715,5,B006DHAT14,"After recently being appointed the youngest head judge in Korean history, Kim Suk-hyun's wife is brutally murdered. After a series of eerily strange coincidences, Suk-hyun begins to believe he is living a parallel life to a judge 30 years before him- a life that places his daughter in danger. Parallel Life is an amazing mystery-thrilled, with a stunningly unexpected ending.

The story in this film is great. The concept of ""Parallel Lives"" is very interesting and adds to the mystery and suspense. Much of the film focuses on investigation, with occasional fights, tense chases against the clock, and suspenseful games of hide-and-seek. The film ultimately leads to an excellent ending; an ending packed with many unexpected twists and turns- right when you think it's over, you're hit with another vicious surprise. The acting in this film is great from the entire cast, the music is also excellent. The editing was a very minor issue for me, as it occasionally used some unnecessary flashing transitions; it isn't uncontrollably bad, but it may be slightly annoying or uncomfortable for those with sensitive eyes.

Overall, Parallel Life is a superb mystery-thriller, from its acting to its music, from its immensely interesting story to its breathtaking finale. As of 3/16/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, a purchase is highly recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.

Parallel Life has strong violence and blood, some sex (no nudity).",1365638400,3,1471,5.198312236286919
