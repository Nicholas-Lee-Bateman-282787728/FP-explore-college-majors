4387249,4,B004IO8UFQ,"I thought this aix-records blu-ray sampler/calibration disc would be more detailed in explaining various player/AVR settings based on each connection type for eachinput/output etc. Mr. Waldrep is also very dry in his delivery of his explanations. He speaks in a measured cadence which isn't too bad but his tone doesn't vary much so it comes off a bit lifeless and flat. He's not a motivational speaker and this disc is about system calibration and sound quality but it would have been a much better disc if the info he imparts were delivered by someone with more energy and personality. The music is only ok and it's not very exciting or really moving in any way. Standard stuff. The test tones/sweeps are basic and don't really offer anything more than basic functionality. I give this disc 4 stars because I guess it doesn't claim to be more than it is but, I hoped for a more detailed guide and explanations.",1389225600,4,912,4.7421383647798745
4387250,5,B004IO8UFQ,"Superb audio calibration disc. Music content is excellent, and the calibration tones and options enable you to fine tune your system to perfection. It's good to have separate test tones on blu-ray or DVD as it provides more options when setting up your speakers i.e.  they are played through a source (BR player, DVD, CD player) and can therefore be sent digitally and processed by the amp or switched to analogue to bypass all amp processing.",1384300800,3,443,4.828947368421052
4387251,5,B004IO8UFQ,Great video and audio.  Crisp video quality with very high quality audio recordings. Highly recommended for demonstration material. Top Technical Quality !,1384041600,2,155,6.045454545454546
4387252,4,B004IO8UFQ,"This is an impressive reference disc for understanding the different music and movie audio tracks available from media. The 5.1 sample music is not all to my taste but it does what is intended, gives you the impression you are actually in the room for the recording, When you add in the sound tests, this is a great disc to help you understand elements to your surround setup, whether it be 2.1, 5.1, or 7.1

If you are like me and have just trusted those microphone setups, this disc will show you the errors these can sometimes make.",1368921600,4,535,4.459183673469388
4387253,5,B004IO8UFQ,you'll also need a sound level meter along with this.  most receivers have calibration tools but I found this disc and a meter helped dial it in even better.  essential if you bypass the receiver processing using analog audio inputs from the Blu Ray player audio outputs.,1361318400,2,271,4.74468085106383
4387254,5,B004IO8UFQ,"What I liked about this Blu-ray disc is that I not only got a great audio set up disc for my
setting up of my stereo system,  but also 3 D samples of country,  jazz and classical music
Blu-ray discs and a 3 D  Rita Coolidge concert disc.  So glad I got this superb sound and
cool  3 D production.",1356998400,,296,3.8666666666666667
4387255,3,B004IO8UFQ,"The music was good (although at least one track was just an excerpt), but I was hoping for more to check out the surround sound (especially for my 7.1 system).  This is a Blu-Ray sampler, after all.  So wouldn't it make sense that it would have tracks to show the full potential effect of all of the audio channels?  Even if the focus was naturally on the music.  The calibration tracks were as described, but then I have essentially the same test tones on full video calibration discs.

Again, not bad, just not great.",1348531200,5,519,4.4787234042553195
8431004,5,B004IO8UFQ,Fast delivery in one piece. What more could one ask for?,1511222400,,56,4.181818181818182
8431005,5,B004IO8UFQ,"Excellent reference disc. I had some trouble with the Audessey set up in my Marantz receiver where the speaker levels were way off, this helped me balance them better. Also found my PS3 was not sending a 7.1 signal. Changed the settings to PCM and was able to verify all 7 channels were working. A must have to verify your system is working properly.",1508716800,,350,4.484375
8431006,4,B004IO8UFQ,"This is primarily an AIX ad to demonstrate high def music recorded in surround, but in the Setup section many useful tools are provided to check setup of both 5.1 and 7.1 surround systems.

It's also an excellent primer on surround in general, HDMI cables, proper layout of speakers and bass management -- how subwoofers are to integrat with the satellite speakers seamlessly.

Be careful not to run your volume too high as the frequency sweeps play. You could blow a speaker, especially if you set your amp to assume your satellite speakers are ""large,"" which sends full-frequency signal power to all speaker instead of sending the bass frequencies and their power to the sub and less powerful high frequencies to the smaller satellites.

The Blu-ray outputs several sets of frequency tests in PCM, Dolby Digital, Master Audio, DTS. Separate tests help you set up 5.1 and 7.1 systems independently.

You should have a dB meter handy unless you just want to trust your ears.",1488844800,4,974,4.884848484848485
