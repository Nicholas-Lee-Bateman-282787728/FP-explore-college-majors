7804623,5,6300181103,"Filmed live at the Jubilee Auditorium in Edmonton, Canada in 1981, backed by Sid Feller conducting the ITV Concert Orchestra and the five talented and attractive ladies known as The Raylettes, Ray Charles gives his all in this concert with a mix of musical genres, all performed with his unique, soulful style, making them his own.

 Though it doesn't include all my favorites (you'd need a 3 hour concert for that), among the songs he performs are: ""Busted"", ""Georgia on My Mind"", ""Hit the Road, Jack"", ""I Can't Stop Loving You"", ""Take These Chains From My Heart"", ""I Can See Clearly Now"", and ""America the Beautiful"".

 Looking fine in a light blue suit, Ray Charles was in his early 50's at the time, and with his professionalism and incredible musicality, shows that his was a life well sung.

 Ray Charles left a legacy of soul music that is enduring, always enjoyable, and a one-of-a-kind experience. Total running time is 50 minutes.",1091923200,2,940,4.807453416149069
