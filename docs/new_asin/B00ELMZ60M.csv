5927458,5,B00ELMZ60M,"Cancelled after one season the humorous James Garner turn-of-the-century western focuses on the title character played by Garner who reluctantly agrees to become sheriff of the town named after his family. Nichols is an unconventional sheriff in a transitional titme; he refuses to carry a gun, rides a motorcycle and has something going on with Ruth (Margot Kidder)who owns the local saloon.

The series had a unique final episode with the writers/producers and star deciding to retool the show because they believed ""Nichols"" might get a shot at a second season. It didn't happen but that won't stop fans who enjoy Garner's wry sense of humor and quirky TV shows from enjoying this forgotten series.

Edit: I've confirmed that apparently the edition being sold by Amazon is DVD-R only while Warner Archive is (at the moment at least) selling pressed DVDs.

There are no subtitles (an idiotic move given that the audience for a classic show like this would benefit from having them).

The menu is static with no description of the various episodes or their original air dates.

The show looks pretty good although there are some issues with color timing in the pilot (meaning it wasn't adjusted during the transfer when they noticed a shift) and the image quality goes from exceptionally good, to decent all within the same episode. During the pilot for example when Nichols first arrives in town the image quality degrades clearly pulled from an inferior dupe (probably due to damage to the film). Contrast varies within the same scenes from one shot to the next going from lighter to darker within the span of a few shots.

Some episodes are better looking than others but Warner does a good job of not overcompressing the image quality limiting 4 episodes per dual layered disc.

It looks to me that there was little restoration done here which isn't a surprise given that Warner Archive releases tend to look relatively clean (except for occasional speckles which are taken out during the restoration process)and uses the best source prints available.

This just indicates that little was done to adjust the show during the transfer for DVD. Colors shift a bit as well due, again, to the age of the film and passage of time. This series is exceptional and most of the episodes look from decent to exceptional. I didn't note any glitches or issues with playing the show on my Blu-ray player or on my computer.

Unfortunately we don't get any special features for this set (not a surprise) although an interview with Garner, Kidder (in one of her first major roles), John Beck or Stuart Margolin to discuss the production and how the producers tried to reboot it in an unusual (and daring) method at the time.

An unconventional turn-of-the-century western, fans of ""Nichols"" will be happy that this is finally released. The series varies a bit in terms of image quality but, on the whole, the show looks pretty good. Unfortunately a cult classic like ""Nichols"" (not very well known unless you're a fan of Garner)isn't going to get the extensive restoration that I would have liked but the fact that we get it on DVD is a big plus.",1377734400,81,3134,4.830223880597015

5927466,5,B00ELMZ60M,"I bought this TV series not knowing what to expect, except that I like James Garner in The Rockford Files and in the B/W Maverick shows airing on the classic TV channels in our area. The show was a little hard to get into initially, but the by Disc 3 when the shows title was changed to ""James Garner as Nichols"" the shows got a lot more interesting and then I couldn't wait to watch them. I finally finished watching the last episode and was initially saddened. I understand that James Garner wanted it this way but it was still sad. Nichols identical brother Jim was an interesting character almost the opposite of Nichols, but the same in many respects.

You know how some shows have a dream sequence wherein the entire episode is shot in another time? A few of the episodes reminded me of The Rockford Files which was yet to come when this show was made. Others reminded me of Maverick. All in all I give this show 5 stars despite being somewhat difficult for me to follow initially. It's definitely not the typical Western in that the Sheriff rides a motorcycle instead of a horse and doesn't carry a gun but knows how to use one. He's always involved in some get rich scheme but never loses sight of morality & always wants to help in making things right. I can see why James Garner said that he enjoyed making this series. The supporting cast is good and Becks dual role as Orv was even better than his primary role. Margot Kidder and Stuart Margolin were very good as well.",1478822400,,1481,4.405109489051095

5927484,2,B00ELMZ60M,This show is a weakly written version of The Rockford Files set in the early 1900's.  This is not the Maverick or Support Your Local Sheriff/Gunfighter Classic James Garner if that is what you are expecting.  The closest i can come is the character he played in Skin Game and even then not up to that standard.  It is generally a very lighthearted story of an ex veteran who returns to his home town of Nichols and becomes the sheriff.  He is supported by Stuart Margolin as his sidekick deputy (he played Angel on The Rockford Files).  Margot Kidder plays a bartender and her talent seems completely wasted.  John Beck's acting talent seems held back as he plays a somewhat bumbling adversarial role.  The woman who plays Ma Ketchum is probably the strongest character.  Great talents are guests on every episode.  A bad show and I am a big James Garner fan.,1446854400,2,859,4.598684210526316

From concept to scripts, casting, and look, it's a fully formed Garner classic. Nichols was the first series made utilizing Garner's own in-house production crew (Cherokee Productions) and also initiates his artistically rich, Yin-Yang on-screen relationship with Stuart Margolin (later as Angel Martin in The Rockford Files). Among James Garner's many television endeavors, this short lived (one season only) series was his personal favorite. I think that says a lot!",1444780800,,576,5.556818181818182

5927488,3,B00ELMZ60M,"Being generous with 3 stars.  James Garner is my favorite TV actor.  Rockford Files is my favorite of his series.

Where to start.  I like strange & offbeat .... but the writing was really bad, especially incoherent in the pilot episode.  Maybe they were trying too hard.  With Garner, they could have used formula TV western story lines + a pinch of ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" humor and made a good series.

SETUP
The Ketcham family now runs ""Nichols, AZ"" - a town Nichols' family founded.  Garner's / Nichols character is sort of home from the army, retired, trying to settle in back home.  The characters in Ketchams' family ""Ma"" Ketchem, and the oldest son - just called ""Ketchem"" for some reason... are the main thorns in the side of Garner as Nichols.

MAIN CRITIQUE
It's sometimes very hard to follow what should be a simple (lazy) good guy/bad guy formula series.  Some scene set ups and endings are confusing.  The editing of scenes.... let's see, I think they had 5 extra scenes for each show and they just threw darts which ones to delete - even if they were important for continuity.  Sometimes a scene seems like it ends 5-10 seconds too early... either someone was heavy handed with the editing (due to commercial TV needs) or it's just poor writing/directing/filming or all 3.

WikiPedia says Meta Rosenberg was promoted to produce Nichols.. I guess this was her first effort - later series were much better.

Examples
- A silly one:  Margot Kidder & Garner camping scene.  Funny setup.  She can't light the fire can, throws down lighter.  She hates cooking.  Next scene, she's cooking, fire, pan and food come out of nowhere.  Who lit the fire?

- Another is the con-man that meets Garner getting off the train (the con man train-hopped illegally to Nichols home town).
This character is so under-developed and confusing that they later have him stealing Ketcham's car - apparently just to have a posse chase scene to exercise the horses.

- Ma Ketcham - seemed mis-cast.  There had to be a toughie that ran the town, forced Nichols to take the sheriff job to repay debts, but the writing and this particular actress didn't seem strong enough.  That persona could have played well against Garner's Nichol's character - keeping him on a short rope, etc. but her character is often lost in the confusion.

Part of the charm is everyone wears a gun in this town (except Garner's ""Nichols"") but no one seems to be able to shoot straight.  No one gets shot except by accident.  It's like watching an old episode of ""A-Team"" or ""Riptide"" - lots of bullets - no hits...  I'd say it's the safest, armed town in TV Land.

MORE ON DIRECTING/EDITING
Another thing about scene transitions.  Hey, if it were satire or Police Story with Leslie Nielsen, great.  One scene, Nielsen disheveled and bleeding, tie torn; 1 second camera cut later, he's perfectly made up, different suit - that's funny, expected.

But Nichols is bad in areas that weren't meant to be bad.

NOTE:  Until episode 11, Frank Pierson (creator) was writing most of the episodes.  Episode 11 ""Away the Rolling River"" was the first with director Ivan Dixon and writer Juanita Bartlett (who later wrote much in the Rockford Files series)...

So, the early writing and story lines and continuity gaps (gaffs?) make this hard to watch, directing is painful - scene transitions often confusing... but maybe if you can get to episode 11, it will even out.

I really wanted to like this series, it's Garner in one of his better anti-hero roles.  It may be best binge-watched (to get it over with) or just start at episode 11, 1st season after watching the pilot.

For early 1900's motorcycle buffs, Garner rides a 1915 or so Harley Davidson.  The episode ""Ma"" buys Garner the bike (to use as sheriff) is especially satisfying.  They went out of their way to film the up-close starting ""routine"" for this old motorcycle - I mean EACH step.  What a treat.

I imagine Mike Wolf & Frank from American Pickers will find this ""Harley bike used in Nichols TV series"" as a barn find in a future episode.",1442361600,6,4062,4.684582743988685

I'm an unabashed Garner fan, who's enjoyed everything he's done...well, maybe not ""Sunset"", but it wasn't his fault. Go ahead and get the Nichols set.

As part of the Warner Archives series, there are no extras on the DVD set but it was a failed series from the 1970s that would be forgotten if Garner had not gone on to have success as Jim Rockford in The Rockford Files and brought Stuart Margolin with him from Nichols.

I decided to return it, and came to find out that they charged me an $18.50 restocking fee - more than 50%of the purchase price - and they have the darn video too? Is that the kind of trust they show their cistomers?
I would warn you to not trust amazon to do the right thing -- they have proved that trust is only when they want it to be.

5927543,5,B00ELMZ60M,"When people think of the actor James Garner most likely they will think of ""The Rockford Files"" or possibly ""Maverick"". But in between those two TV series there was another show that starred Garner. It lasted only one season back in 1971-72. It was called ""Nichols"" and of all the TV series James Garner starred in that was my favorite show of his. The series was a western but not like any western you had ever seen. There were no weekly shoot outs or bar room brawls as would be expected in your normal western. As Nichols Garner did not carry a gun. Instead of the brawls and gun play there was dialog and character development with humor thrown in here and there. The story lines were easy to follow yet riveting to watch. It is one of the few shows I can remember watching where you cared about the characters the actors were playing on the show. And maybe that is why the show was canceled after only one season. Too unconventional for a western plus too much talk and not enough action to hold many of the viewers attention. It is just sad that the network didn't give the show enough of a chance to find an audience because I think it was out there. It is hard to build up an audience for a TV series when all you give it is one season to try. In an attempt to draw interest in the series and hopefully stop the cancelation notice the producers of the show ended the first season on a very unusual note that as far as I know had never happened on a TV series up to that point. I will not say what happened. If you remember and are a fan of the show you know what happened. If you hadn't seen the show before then I don't want to create any spoiler alerts and will say no more. All I will say is that it didn't work and ""Nichols"" was removed from the air.

What I will say about ""Nichols"" is how disappointed in the show I am. This is a great show that deserves every one of the five stars I gave it so that is not the problem. I am disappointed and upset that this series is only available in DVD-R format. What! Really? For a long time I have been waiting and hoping that one day ""Nichols"" might be released on disc. And now it has but I will not buy this from Amazon or anywhere else apparently. Why? Because it can only be found on DVD-R. Yes when it first came out it was on DVD but they only printed so many copied in that format. But now with all the DVDs sold out you can only find ""Nichols"" on DVD-R. There is no way I am going to pay almost $50 for something, whether ""Nichols"" or any other show, that is recorded on DVD-R. For that kind of money I want the real deal not some copy.

My reason then for writing this review is twofold. First I wanted to state my position what a great show ""Nichols"" was and how much I think the viewer will enjoy this series if they take the time to watch it. At the same time this review is a warning however that you are taking chances in ordering ""Nichols"" since most likely you will not be getting the show in DVD but rather as a burned copy on DVD-R.  If you are like me you want to get the best value for your dollar when you purchase something. Paying almost $50 for what is essentially a bootleg copy is to me no value at all.",1384473600,17,3184,4.0912
5927544,5,B00ELMZ60M,"Excellent set -- James Garner has always claimed that this was his favorite series. I don't know if I would go that far (I'm very partial to ""The Rockford Files"") but this is still a great show.

However, be warned of one minor error: Disc 1, Episode 4 is NOT ""Paper Badge"" as it is labled. Instead, it is ""Ketchum Power."" And Disc 3, Episode 1 which is labled as ""Ketchum Power"" is in fact, ""Paper Badge"" -- not a huge mistake, but as Warner Brothers owns the show, you would think that they would get it right. So if you do want to watch the series in its proper order, you're going to be making a few extra disc changes.

That said, mine is one of the DVD-R sets. Maybe other sets have ""Paper Badge"" and ""Ketchum Power"" correctly labled? Just so you can make sure, the real ""Paper Badge"" episode features Joyce Van Patten as a guest star.",1383868800,3,841,4.25
5927545,5,B00ELMZ60M,"At a time when shoot-`em-up westerns were popular television fare there came a thoughtful, well written, unusual series, Nichols.  It immediately appealed to me because of the quirky, well-developed characters, and because the lead was intelligent and non-violent.

As a viewer, be prepared for a couple of things.  First, the pace of episodes is pretty ""leisurely.""  More attention is given to interactions than to big actions (like brawls and gunfights).  The payoff for you, though, is that after a few episodes you will feel like you know the principals well.  You'll recognize them as people in your own life, appreciating subtle satire in their predicaments.  Also,  you'll need to consider that the show is really more of a wry, witty, thoughtful comedy than a ""wild western.""  Once you are ""in synch"" with the show, though, you'll be rewarded.

I have grown up with television, suckling on the teats of a black and white Silvertone as a baby, thrilled by our family's first color T.V., and today streaming high-definition content to my home theater.  I'd place Nichols in my top ten of personal favorite television shows.  I suspect it mirrors Garner's true personality more than any other of his films or shows, and it is VERY different from anything else I've ever seen.  I am very grateful to Warner Bros. for releasing the DVD collection.  I will savor every episode!",1383091200,53,1379,4.965065502183406

5927548,5,B00ELMZ60M,"James Garner has said for years that this is his favorite among all the series that he's done. Anything with Garner is worth watching, but this show really is something special. It's darker and more cynical than ""Maverick"" or ""The Rockford Files,"" reflecting the Vietnam era in which it was produced. Created, produced, and sometimes written by Frank Pierson (later an Oscar winner for ""Dog Day Afternoon""), it's also a very smart show with an excellent cast, including Neva Patterson, Stuart Margolin, Margot Kidder, and John Beck.

As another reviewer pointed out, the situations that are presented are boring and you don't care how they are resolved.  Maybe Garner was trying to blow up the traditional western genre or something.  I was only 10 when this aired on network TV, so I don't really remember it.  After trying to find it on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, etc, I finally jumped in and bought the DVD set.  I just thought this would be more along the lines of Maverick or Rockford Files or even Support Your Local Sheriff.  It is none of those.  Garner turns in a solid performance, as usual, but the writing is terrible.  Most of the plotlines don't even make sense and the casting, for the most part, is poor.  They really lost me when all the men in the town went gaga over Joyce Van Patten.  Seriously?  With Margo Kidder downstairs at the bar?  Come on.

How this series got beyond 6 episodes is unexplainable and the somewhat interesting Rockford Files is at least ten times better than this garbage scow.
