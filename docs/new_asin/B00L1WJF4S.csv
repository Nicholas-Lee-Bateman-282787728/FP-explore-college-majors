Decent soundtrack, easy to listen to, even as an adult, which is a plus when your kids play it over and over again.

6461295,5,B00L1WJF4S,This has got to be my favorite Veggie Tales story!,1436140800,,50,4.1
6461296,5,B00L1WJF4S,"Last October, I bemoaned yet about Christmas story from the folks at VeggieTales and hoped theyd give us something new this year.  I was delighted this year to see them release Beauty and the Beet.  Yes, there are some Christmas lights and evergreens in the background, but this is a story that can be watched and enjoyed any time.

As Bob the Tomato is introducing this episode, Larry the Cucumber runs in.  Hes gotten an emergency letter (you can tell because it was handwritten  in crayon!) from a girl who is wondering how to handle the new mean girl at her school.  Larry has just the story and introduces their take on a familiar fairytale.

Mirabelle (voiced by Kelly Pickler) is the lead vocalist for her familys traveling band, the Veggie Tones.  They are just starting out, but with a hit song, their fame is rising, and theyve just been invited to perform at Vegetable Square Garden.  Certain this will make their career, her father (played by Larry the Cucumber), sets out just as a snow storm is hitting.

Unfortunately, the storm is worse than expected, and the family is stranded at a creepy hotel in the middle of nowhere.  With no money and no bus (dont ask), they just clean and sing for a place to stay under the nasty eye of Mr. Beet, the owner.  However, Mirabelle feels the need to reach out to him with Gods love.  Can she melt the heart of this man?  Will they ever get out of the hotel?

As if the title didn't give it away, this is obviously a take on Beauty and the Beast.  However, they have stripped out any romantic love and made it all about showing Gods love to others.  The familiar elements of the story make appearances in different ways that those familiar with the original will have fun spotting.  (No magic is involved, however.)  The result is very heart warming and really illustrates the lesson that God wants us to show His love to others and just how that can transform them  and us.

While the lesson is part of the story, this isn't quite as funny as some of the previous entries in the long running series.  That said, there is one gag late in the story that is absolutely priceless.  It may be my favorite for the last several videos in fact.  Im also not quite sure how boys will react to this one, although I certainly enjoyed it.

With Kellie Pickler voicing the lead character and the story revolving around singers, it should be no surprise that there are lots of new songs.  They are enjoyable and really fit into the theme of the story well.

And yes, there is a new silly song.  Every wondered about the birth of Mac and Cheese?  Larry sets the record straight as we go back to his great, great, greatgrandparents and learn how this combination came to be.  Its fun.

Speaking of fun, the one acknowledgement to the season is Deck the Halls, a Veggie Tones video that plays after the show ends.  Its pretty funny with a few twists on the classic carol that everyone will enjoy.

Ultimate, Beauty and the Beet is sweet and endearing while reminding us that God wants us to love everyone, even those who are hardest to love.  It might not be as funny as some entries, but it is still a great lesson told in an entertaining way.",1434758400,,3181,4.436960276338515

6461354,5,B00L1WJF4S,"Those of you who know me, know that I'm a big fan of Veggie Tales. So it shouldn't surprise you to know that when I was offered the opportunity to watch their newest adventure, that I jumped at the chance.

Beauty and the Beet is a charming rendition of a familiar story. And just as in the classic ""Beauty and the Beast"", there is a lesson to be learned about love.

Mirabelle is traveling with her band, The Veggie Tones, on their way to an important, and hopefully well paying gig when a storm hits. Maybe not quite as bad as Buffalo, NY got this week, but bad enough that they have to stop because of the weather conditions.  They have no money, and their offer to sing for their supper isn't warmly received by the grumpy Mr. Beet.

As they take on the list of chores that Mr. Beet insists that they do to pay for their meals and room, Mirabelle, alone in the family does so without grumbling. The rest of the family isn't quite as willing to repay ""mean"" with  ""nice"" but Mirabelle insists, because God loves here even though she might not deserve it, so the least she can do is love someone else.  And despite the resistance, she perseveres.

Over time Mr. Beet's heart softens in the face of Mirabelle's persistence.  And there are a lot of surprises along the way to his transformation.

A story of what God's love can do, told in a way that only the Veggie Tales can do. Recording star Kellie Pickler is the voice of Mirabelle, and the new songs will have you dancing in your seats.  And of course  there's a new Silly Song with Larry, plus all sorts of bonus features and previews.

If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?

If you've already seen it, go ahead, you know you want to watch it again. Fun for all ages.",1416528000,,1740,4.300613496932515

When we picked it up, there was a sticker of the woman on the package.  Inside the DVD case there was an insert with 4 pictures of her showing much of her chest--very inappropriate for anybody, but these are supposed to be for the children.

There was homosexual humor involving  one male character talking to another about a quiche and the other thought he said kiss.

The main character sings a rebellious song with her loving her man even though everyone says how bad he is, because after all he is special to God just the way he is.  Not at all biblical.

The video was poorly done compared to other Veggie movies and the message was bad,  Skip this one and shame on VeggieTales for trying to pass this junk off as being Christian.",1414022400,17,899,4.493827160493828
6461382,5,B00L1WJF4S,"I was in my teens when VeggieTales burst onto the scene, and I've been watching them ever since! Imagine my excitement, then, when I learned of a new VeggieTales movie for me to introduce to my children, ""Beauty and the Beet""...and right in time for the holidays! We all cozied up for a family movie night...and boy did we all get a treat. This film finds the veggies at their finest, taking a classic story and giving it a ""veggie twist"". The characters are full of life and the film is a treat to watch with all the action that fills the screen as well as the wonderful songs that will have your toes tapping along. My children were riveted from the start to the finish, enjoying the story and the songs...with Larry's silly song being one of their favourite moments of course! And I love that the movie is wonderfully entertaining without parents needing to be worried that the story will be too scary or that the kids will be exposed to something they shouldn't. Rather, like my children, yours will walk away having learned the important lesson of unconditional love and the power of kindness and friendship, a lesson easy to swallow with the good dose of laughter that the veggies always are able to provide. In fact, I will admit that while I did watch this movie primarily for the sake of my children, I think I enjoyed it just as much as they did! This is one of those movies that we will be watching over and over again, and I encourage you to pick up a copy for yourselves.

I highly recommend this movie to children and families, not only to be thoroughly entertained, but to gain some Biblical truth along the way. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

6461383,5,B00L1WJF4S,"My kids have only seen a few Veggie Tales titles, but this one is definitely a favorite so far.  My 3 year old daughter especially enjoys it because she recognizes the Beauty and the Beast store from it.  It's funny how she understands it.  The story is great for the whole family and emphasizes friendship, unconditional love, looking at someone from the inside rather than their appearance and more.  It is really a cute title and had us all watching all 45 minutes of it.  The songs are silly and the animation is awesome.  It does have a biblical tone to parts of it, as expected from Veggie Tales but it is not pushy or overtly religious.  The lessons are the main focus and I think everyone could benefit from them.  This is a title we have watched a few times already and I am sure we will continue to watch it.  Something about talking vegetable characters makes us smile.",1413590400,4,880,4.45
6461384,5,B00L1WJF4S,"How cute is the cover for Beauty and the Beet? Well the movie is even cuter! My kids LOVED this and even baby Jax who is nine months old sat and watched it a little! I think the vibrant colors, fun voices and beautiful music just drew him in!

I am a huge fan of Kelly Pickler so her music MIGHT have been the reason I sat and watched the whole thing...more than once.... Ok fine, I love Veggie Tales - I admit it! But her voice added to this made it so amazing! The music was beautiful and added so much to the story. A voice real does have the ability to touch you and move you. I thought it was so cute that Paige would try to sing along from the first time she heard it even though she didn't know the songs at all. It's just that kind of music!

I thought it was cute that Kelly's role in the movie was very much like her own true rise to stardom.

As always, the Veggie Tales are full of good lessons every parent wants their kids to learn. In the spirit of the holidays, the subject of unconditional love is a strong theme.

I love the wit and humor in Veggie Tales and find myself laughing out loud a lot. It's a bit corny and cheesy and I love that! Most importantly, it's good, clean humor. There's nothing more beautiful than the sound of my children's laughter. It's something we can all relate to and enjoy together. This is the kind of humor I want my kids to emulate.

The Veggie Tales Beauty and the Beet is my favorite Veggie Tales to date and I've seen many over the years. I loved the musical element and Kelly Pickler just made the music come to life and such an incredible part of this movie.",1413504000,,1613,4.091772151898734
6461385,5,B00L1WJF4S,"Our family is a lover of all things VeggieTales, however, I've been let down by a few of their more recent films that contained jokes that were way over the kids heads. That wasn't the case in this film. All four of my kids LOVED it (and I did, too). My kids (ages 6-12) aren't up to speed with country music, so they really had no idea who Kelly Pickler was, but they didn't care. This film rocked and taught a lot about unconditional love.

I was disappointed when VeggieTales switched from Bible Stories to classic stories, however this one came out on top. It's probably in my top 5 VeggieTales movies ever made - it's right up there with The Pirates who don't do Anything and the Easter Story.

The downside? The silly song with Larry wasn't up to its normal catchy-ness. But it was silly none-the-less.

Except for Larry's silly song, the music isn't fun and the kids didn't enjoy this video. Unless you or your children are country music or Kellie Pickler fans, pass this one by and choose another. I'm giving it three stars instead of the two it deserves because the message is inspirational and there's nothing really objectionable for kids to see or hear.

6461387,5,B00L1WJF4S,"Taking a lesson straight from the Bible and putting it into terms that kids and even adults will love is what has made Veggie Tales so successful. In the episode Beauty and the Beet, Kelly Pickler guest stars as the voice of Mirabelle, the lead singer of a rising band called the VeggieTunes. As they are working hard at finding new and bigger places to sing, they finally get the break they were hoping for, singing in Vegetable Square Garden. Only in order to get their in time, they will need to take the tour bus on the road during a snow storm. Against their better judgment, they find the road conditions are too hazardous to continue and find lodging at the Alpine Sweets Motel.

When they arrive, they find that the motel is friendly enough but there is only one other guest in the motel. With dreary interiors, they decide to stay for one night but they can only afford one room for seven guests. Bob Tomato stars as the hotel cook who prepares a sumptuous feast but when the guest claim they can't afford it, the Beet, makes his conditions known. No one gets anything free in his motel. Unable to pay for the room or the meal, Beet agrees to let the band work to pay for their stay by cleaning the room and performing for the dinner show.

Along the way, sweet potato Mirabelle soon charms her way into the heart of the Beet, whose love for music helps calm the savage beast inside of him. Mirabelle tries to teach him to sing, but soon his temper gets the best of him, and soon the band agrees that it's time to leave. As they make their way to Vegetable Square Garden, Mirabelle feels like they still have some unfinished business to attend to with the Beet and even though he doesn't deserve it, they should still try and help him out especially when an undercover news team shows up in hopes of showing viewers what a low star motel the Alpine Sweets really is. Will Mirabelle be able to help Beet save his reputation? Or will his temper simply get the best of him again? You'll have to pick this one up to find out.

It teaches the value of unconditional love utilizing the idea the no matter how people treat us, we can still show them love just like God shows us. There is even another Silly Song with Larry, ""Mac and Cheese"" which tells the story of the invention of macaroni and cheese. There are 8 songs in this delightful and truly charming DVD from Kelly Pickler that you will find yourself singing long after the movie is over. Plus there are some great bonus features, a Behind the Scenes with Kelly Pickler, Sing Along Songs from the movie, A Very Veggie Jukebox, Downloadable activities and so much more. The DVD is approximately 56 minutes in length and something you know your kids will enjoy and want to watch over and over. I easily give this one 5 out of 5 Veggie Stars!",1412985600,12,3103,4.440350877192983

8663216,4,B00L1WJF4S,"Yes this is Veggie Tales, and yes it has a great message of forgiveness, and loving those who aren't so nice, BUT the choice of songs are a little bothersome.  'Baby' is not a reference I want my 10 year old getting used to using.  It's a little 'teenage' for me.  I actually have her fast forward past that particular song in the movie.  All in all it's a great movie though.",1464998400,,376,4.180555555555555
