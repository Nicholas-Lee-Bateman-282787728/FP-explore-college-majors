7291146,5,B00ZRBQKL0,Excellent movie.  I had never seen this movie or don't remember if I did or not.  I had been wanting this movie since it went out of print a few years ago then snatched it up when it became available again.  It is definitely worth the purchase and one I would watch again.,1449446400,3,272,4.09433962264151

8720738,4,B00ZRBQKL0,"Enjoyed the story, music and just being an old fashioned movie with no sex scenes, cursing or violence.  I really liked the song at the end of the movie.  A real hit from the 40's.",1527984000,,180,4.114285714285714
8720739,5,B00ZRBQKL0,"Very good movie driven by characters and small town dynamics and theme of war, and Jan Michael Vincent is pretty hard to take your eyes off of in this movie, as all his younger movies. Richard Gere is in his prime in this movie, but just about disappeared sitting next to Jan Michael Vincent in this movie, but that happens to everyone who ends up in a JMV movie.",1519171200,,363,4.27536231884058

8720745,5,B00ZRBQKL0,"A tender, scenic backdrop sets the stage in one of his best, if you like Jan-Michael Vincent. He washes out of The Marines Basic Training & wears the traditional light blue uniform to signify not making the grade of a Marine. He meets a fine girl and enlists in the Army and becomes a soldier. The inner workings of the plot enter the film in various ways, including the search for a Native American that comes to Jan-Michael being shot.
It has that warm feeling that may make some women cry. It ranks up there with ""The Mechanic"" with Charles Bronson & Jan-Michael.",1469145600,3,566,4.504854368932039
8720746,4,B00ZRBQKL0,I liked the movie very much.  The main reason I bought it was because I was cast as an extra as a recruit in the Boot Camp scenes when I was in the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton.,1464048000,,179,3.710526315789474
8720747,5,B00ZRBQKL0,This is a sweet little romance that includes Richard Gere's first spoken lines in a film.  To me this film captures the feel of life in the USA during World War II better than any other I have seen.,1456790400,6,198,4.076923076923077
