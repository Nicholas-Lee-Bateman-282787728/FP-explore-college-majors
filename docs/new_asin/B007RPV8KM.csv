8521486,1,B007RPV8KM,I did not feel like I got much of a workout at all.  The video seemed very short.,1413504000,,81,3.5
8521487,4,B007RPV8KM,"I have never heard of BBB before so I tried it for the first time & I really liked Zayna's personality. She does seem airheaded but I think that it's her easy going personality & laid back attitude. I felt like I was working out with a girlfriend..
I do think that the upper body portion was a little lacking so I did some extra exercises to compensate. Most of the exercises and positions are probably nothing you haven't seen before although Zayna does put a little twist on them whilst adding a few moves I haven't seen before & I have every barre dvd imaginable..

So, all in all, a good purchase but I'm giving it 4 starts because I did feel a little cheated with the upper body portion..I would recommend this workout to anyone.",1397433600,,734,4.357664233576642
8521488,4,B007RPV8KM,"I love barre workouts and own many  because I need variety in my rotation to stay motivated. I have the Bar Method, Ballet Body, Pure Barre, Tracy Mallett, Pop Physique, Turbo Barre , Cardio Barre, Rocking Models, Ballet Physique etc.  I do enjoy this Boston Body Barre because it has some different elements and exercises that aren't in the other workouts and I also get results from it. Barre workouts are as hard as you make them and can be quite strenuous without plyo-jacks and burpees. If you want to break a sweat and burn more calories, then just get down lower, focus on form and get deeper into the muscle. If you don't, of course, it's an easier workout, and you can select it for a lighter workout day. I gave it a four instead of a five just because the affectation in her speech does not add to my experience as she's constantly talking, not that this has anything to do with the quality of the workout, she's simply not someone I'd want to be sitting next to at lunch.",1391212800,,983,4.395604395604396
8521489,5,B007RPV8KM,"This workout is a great calorie burner. I've taken the instructor training with Zayna Gold, and this video is a great introduction to barre. You can definitely increase the intensity by adding more reps of each exercise (especially the small, isometric, pulsing movements) and going at a faster pace. We learned a variety of options to teach in class- including more upper body work. She offers video clips on BostonFitnessMagazine.com that can be incorporated into your barre workout. She might be wearing the sneakers for a little support (lower back, ankles) because she teaches numerous classes each week. I wear them myself for that reason- many people do. Many others prefer bare feet. Zayna has a light-hearted approach that seems to make everyone (with every body type) feel welcome in her classes, but underneath that humor is a serious knowledge of movement and anatomy.",1381968000,,880,5.118055555555555
8521490,5,B007RPV8KM,Love Zayna and the Boston Body Barre. She is very pleasant and easy to follow. I love this workout. Love it so much I am now looking to take one of Zayna's courses to learn to teach it myself.,1361750400,,192,3.948717948717949
8521491,5,B007RPV8KM,I like this lady a lot. We all just wonder why she has on sneakers. I would like to know. Otherwise the rest is pretty good. I like it because she's an older woman with comfortable clothing on. No distractions except for the sneakers.,1357084800,,234,4.340909090909091
8521492,3,B007RPV8KM,"This video is approx 1 hour and contains the following sections: barre, matwork, cardio, upper body sculpting. The instructor recommends a small ""playground ball"", mat, elastic band, and either chair/barre. I just used a chair and rolled up towel in place of the playground ball and that worked fine. The front cover of the video claims it burns 400+ calories... highly doubtful. I'd say more like 150-200.

The barre work is all lower body, with leg lifts and a lot of inner thigh work. I didn't see anything new that I haven't seen on other barre/ballet type videos before. It was a good burn in the lower body but I wouldn't say you work up a sweat.

The ""cardio"" section is like 5-10 mins and consists of marching in place, side-to-side, and knee lifts. Not exactly super workout material. It will get your body warmed up but don't expect to burn a lot of calories.

The upper body section was odd to me, it was basically 1 exercise for like 5-10 minutes and it worked your upper/middle back. I definitely felt it by the end, but I expected more variety.

The matwork section is all abs but no regular crunches, mostly pilates-style lifts/bridges.

I found the instructor to be annoying with her chatter... she seems really airheaded. The exercises are a nice pace to follow along to and the instructor has no problems with cueing. I also found the music annoying.. it was trying to be dance music but failing in my opinion.

Overall, maybe good for a low-impact workout for those who like barre/pilates. Not good for people looking to burn calories.",1344124800,4,1554,4.673992673992674
