8611198,5,0929756983,"This 1991 Video Visits tour of London is a splendidly made documentary on the magic and mystique of London. Some of the cities history is visited as is the culture of both London and its people. People thinking of traveling to London would do well to see this video. The Video Visits was a series of travel videos which gives a very good overview of the places the videos were about and this one is particularly well made. It features looks at many places in and around London including Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey Covent Gardens and The Tower of London. I also love the theme music by Sound Sculpture.",1414886400,,611,4.614678899082569
