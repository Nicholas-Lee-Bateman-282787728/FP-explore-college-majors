Rebirth Of The Independent Record Shop""
. . . . .

This brief documentary is an ardent love letter to locally owned record stores, once a dying breed and now back off the endangered list as the novelty of the digital era gives way to a more mature view of the music world. The setting is Great Britain, as musically-obsessed a nation as ever there was, and the cast of characters includes dozens of delightfully idiosyncratic record store owners and employees, and many of their numerous fans, including music journalists and fabled British artists such as Billy Bragg, Johnny Marr and Paul Weller of The Jam, who sing the praises of their favorite local shops, while also offering clear-eyed analyses of what went wrong.

The opening chapters paint a dire picture, of a heartless music industry that threw the indie shops to the wolves when their corporate profit models changed, and a fickle fan base who plundered the Internet's bounty when Napster & Co. arose, and quit spending money in the analog world... Many shops went under, but the sellers that survived became lean and adaptable, as well as philosophical about the various twists of fate. The film examines a global phenomenon through a ""small"" local filter, and while the specifics may have been different in other countries, the overall story sound much the same. (And I'm sure I'm not the only viewer who spent a lot of the movie quickly absorbing the flavors and rhythms of various shops across the UK, looking yearningly at the overstuffed record bins in the background shots, and making mental lists of all the stores I'd love to check out on my next vacation...)

Numerous interviewees offer clear and cogent explanations of how indie stores fit into the wider music business, and how the changes of the '80s, '90s and '00s made them vulnerable to decline. The funereal tone of the film gives way, surprisingly, to a strong note of hope, as a new generation of music lovers got the ""shop local"" vibe, and events like the annual Record Store Day brought new life into the surviving shops. The end of the film feels a little rushed (probably trying to keep it short enough for TV slots, perhaps?) but the optimistic tone is a pleasant note to end on.

This documentary is simultaneously clear-eyed and misty-eyed -- a neat trick -- and is an informative and delightful excursion into the world of independent music and independent retail. Plus, what a great cast of characters - one charming local music nerd after another... what's not to love? Highly recommended!

8565955,5,B00BCJ0VJS,"Watch this film. That needs to be stated upfront. Watch this film. So why? Why?! Because you wouldnt be reading this if you didn't have an interest in independent music and film, which is having the life strangled out of it by the so-called advancement of civilization in the modern age, and director Pip Piper has crafted a visual guide for discovering and salvaging these most-important bastions of art and life and love, these beautiful brick and mortar oases that have been responsible for introducing countless people to the most important thing there is, in my mind: three chords and the truth. Last Shop Standing is a fast-paced, engaging documentary about independent record stores across the UK, and this North American edition from Conveyor and MVD Visual beefs up the original 50-minute film with 74 minutes of extras. Pipers film is inspired by Graham Jones book of the same name, and follows the same path  a coast-to-coast-to-coast-to-coast journey across the UK, from Bristol to Glasgow to Cardiff to Cambridge, visiting the few long-standing record stores that have managed to keep their doors open as well as a new hope: freshly opened record stores run by folks who hope to keep the tradition alive. In addition to on-site interviews with the proprietors of these shops, the film features fantastic testimony from BBC Radio 6 DJ Jo Good and musicians like Paul Weller, Billy Bragg, Johnny Marr, Richard Hawley, and  for this deluxe DVD edition  Sid Griffin. Hows that for explaining why you should watch this film?! Watch this film. And buy a copy (or three) at an independent record store its just the right thing to do.",1384646400,2,1639,4.931159420289855
8565956,3,B00BCJ0VJS,"The good news is, it sounds like record stores in the UK have bottomed out and are now on the upswing.  Bad news is, this isn't the case in the US as far as I can tell.  In Los Angeles, which only happens to be the second largest market in the country, we have only one major store of note (Amoeba) and otherwise certain Barnes & Nobles have small CD sections which now push DVDs much harder.

Also, this ""film"" is less than an hour long, I'm guessing it was originally aired on the telly.  Especially once you fire up the disc and realize that the bonus interviews are longer than the main attraction!  It's well done, fast paced and great if you're in Blighty.",1381363200,,662,4.264
8565957,5,B00BCJ0VJS,"These are great times for vinyl records. With the arrival of the compact disc (CD), it seemed that vinyl was dead, and was being replaced by a more efficient system of sound. Well... not quite.  Surprisingly, it took little time for CDs to have detractors, those that claim that vinyl is better - the jury is still out on that. Well, vinyl is back and artists are releasing them, stores are selling them, and the splendid ""Last Shop Standing"" takes a detailed and very informative look at the return of vinyl.

Based on the book by the same name, by Graham Jones, the film starts by quoting some owners of existing record shops in England, most notably Keith Hudson, from C E Hudson, which opened in 1906 and closed in 2012. From then on, the documentary evolves into chapters, beginning with ""The Rise,"" detailing the birth of the independent record shops in England during the late 60s, with acts like Elvis Presley and the Beatles, and how they increased with the arrival of Punk Rock. It mentions that the golden age of independent record shops was the 80s and 90s. ""The Fall"" goes into detail explaining the mistakes that caused the decline of independent record shops, indicating that one was the replacement of vinyl with compact discs (CD), with Tony Wadsworth (former chairman and CEO of EMI Music UK) concluding that, ""You can't actually love CD. You love the music, but you can't love the format."" In addition, the arrival of Napster and downloading, supermarkets selling cheaper product, record companies overreacting and didn't handling the situation well, all contributed to the decline of independent record shops. In the 80s, there were more than 2,200 independent record shops in the UK; by 2009, there were only 269 left. On the other hand, on the last chapter, ""The Rebirth,"" we are told about some independent record shops coming back, as well as vinyl sales, thanks to internet publicity, live bands, exclusive vinyl deals, ""Record Shop Day,"" and more.

""Last Shop Standing - The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of the Independent Record Shop"" includes interviews with many record store owners, musicians, and music executives, and takes a great look about the state of the Independent Record Shop. It is a delight to see the owners being interviewed, with their shops' rich and colorful displays as background. It reminds me of my own present experiences when buying vinyl (yes, I buy vinyl) here in California, which is also undergoing a revival of Independent Record stores. Growing up in the 60s, I actually enjoyed the pleasure of buying vinyl and greatly miss those days. ""Last Shop Standing - The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of the Independent Record Shop"" brings all those pleasures back. The DVD has extended interviews with the participants in the film and more.

8565958,4,B00BCJ0VJS,"One of two new DVDs about the rise and fall (and rise?) of Independent Record Stores

This week - just two days before 2013 Record Store Day - I got TWO new DVDs, both documentaries celebrating independent record shops. One covers the British market while the other focuses on one store in Louisville, KY, while it does include interviews with shop owners in other parts of the US.  Since they are similar, I'm making this a combined review and will post it under both titles. Both have ""release"" dates of April 23rd but should be in independent record stores on April 21st (RSD)

""Last Shop Standing"" (LSS)  is really the ""official DVD"" of Record Store Days 2013 (per the distributor).  A standard version of the 48-minute film is available in the PAL-format (not playable in the US) but has no bonues. The ""Deluxe Edition"" (the one coming on 4/23/13) adds 74 minutes of extras (more on those in a minute).  Based on the book of the same name LSS is a compilation of interview segments with owners of 27 different independent record stores in the UK as well as musicians (who started out as record collectors) like Bi;lly Bragg, Paul Well and Johnny Marr. There are also comments from a former Record Executive with EMI. My favorite shop owners are an elderly couple who have had their shop for over 50 years!.  The film has three chapters: ""The Rise"", ""The Fall"" and ""The Rebirth"". The 48 minutes seem to drag at some points when many of the interviews seem to sound alike but I still enjoyed it.

The bonuses include the 4 1/2 -minute """"Rebirth Continued"" which was filmed after the film was released and spends most of the time with a guy who created a coffee shop/record store named ""Pie & Vinyl"" to keep his operation going. The 6-minute ""Shop Talk"" has some funny stories about customers. The balance consists of extended interviews (6 to 12 minutes) with Weller (The Jam, Style Council), Bragg and some others and 25-minute interview with Marr (Morrissey, The Smiths). I actually found these more interesting than many of the interviews in the basic film.

The other DVD - ""Brick and Mortar and Love"" - focuses on the ""ear X-tacy Records"" shop in Louisville, which was in business for over 25 years. It was a Louisville institution and drew a wide variety of ""recorded music"" buyers. It featured in store appearances by local bands - some, like My Morning Jacket"" went on to become famous but came back to play in the shop to support them. Director Scott Shuffit follows owner John Timmons as he opens - and then moves- his store location, trying to compete with the ""big box store"" chains. (Downloaded music is mentioned as a threat to small record stores but, surprisingly, on line merchants are not.) We hear comments from managers of other large independent stores like Amoeba Records in California and Grimey's in Nashville. Even though the film is only 69 minutes long, it seemed to repeat itself a bit too often. Jim James fans will enjoy seeing the My Morning Jacket lead sing briefly at the beginning and the end but, generally, there is little music on the soundtrack or on screen. It's obviously in the ""grooves"" of the vinyl records that stock the store. I can recommend this to supporters of independent stores too see what it's like behind the scenes.

Both of these DVDs should be for sale at your local independent record shop and - while I think Amazon provides easy access to purchasing, you might want to try those shops first. After all - as we see in both of these - their number is shrinking.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
