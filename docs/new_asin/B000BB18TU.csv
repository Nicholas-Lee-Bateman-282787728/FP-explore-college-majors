My mom and I watched this together, and we both thought it was kind of boring. He never really could spice up that much. Also another bad thing is it doesn't have that good of picture and sound quality, probably because it is so old. It does give the right information and what you need to know, but at alot of the parts of the movie, I got bored watching it.",1345248000,4,480,4.117021276595745
8084157,2,B000BB18TU,"I bought this DVD not knowing the quality or content.  I was hoping for a National Geographic quality film all about cats. You know, a really cool documentary for the family, engaging and entertaining.  Alas, I was almost immediately put to sleep by the video which was mostly this narrator talking about cats. The picture quality wasn't that great either.

  There were some cats in the video but, really, I could buy a book and be more entertained and informed.  Please reconsider when deciding to purchase this video.",1134432000,32,520,4.8522727272727275

I mean, let's take a look at how each responds to a suburban city street. A dog will wander out into the middle of the road without a thought in the world, careless to the danger of oncoming vehicles around him. The dog unfortunately will likely be struck and killed by someone not paying attention. The cat on the other hand, darts across the street, observant to its surroundings, conscious of its mortality. I also happen to agree with De Niro's character in Meet The Parents, when he talks about how cats make you earn their respect. That's mostly true. A dog is more fun to play with, taking it for walks, throwing the frisbee. But the cat's selectivity and aloofness make the attention it does give out more interesting and valued.",1128816000,9,897,4.50920245398773
