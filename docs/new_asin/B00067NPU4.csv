The original Japanese name of Toho Studios sci-fier, YOG, MONSTER FROM SPACE is ""Gezora, Ganime, Kameba: Kessen! Nankai no daikaij.""

Here, the monstrously tentacled Gezora is, like Godzilla and so many other creatures of this genre, just a guy inside a cheesy rubber suit. This one even has electric light eyeballs! Unfortunately, despite all efforts a walking octopus just looks darn silly!

SYNOPSIS--
Aliens invade a space probe, then crash it on a deserted atoll. Their plan is to infect small animals with bacteria that can quickly transform them into giant creatures which will... CONQUER THE EARTH!
