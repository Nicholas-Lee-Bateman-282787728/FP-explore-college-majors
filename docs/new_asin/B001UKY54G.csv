8344129,4,B001UKY54G,"This is a well-done psychological thriller following the descent of a young manicurist into depression and hallucinations. Captivating from the opening sequence. Slow moving but suspenseful. Well-directed and good performances all round with incredible cinematography. Deneuve is beautiful, of course, and is exceptional in her role. A sensitive and emotional portrayal of a fragile, troubled young girl. Dark, psychological drama turns into Hitchcock on steroids. This movie is not for everyone, but if you start it, I would recommend seeing it to the end.",1469836800,,557,5.642857142857143
