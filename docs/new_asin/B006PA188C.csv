5012386,5,B006PA188C,"This is a good companion disc for Ben 10 Ultimate Alien, although they should be packaged together.  Three more words.",1378252800,,118,4.9
5012387,5,B006PA188C,Grandson loves all of the Ben 10 movies.  I don't evenmind watching them.  They are just hard to find sometimes and they don't come out very often...,1363046400,,149,4.481481481481482
5012388,5,B006PA188C,"Although it is sad to see the end of such a well done show, this set of episodes lives up to the overall excellence of the Ben 10 universe.",1362614400,2,139,3.8275862068965516
5012389,5,B006PA188C,"My nephew loves this DVD. He received it as a Christmas present and could not be happier with it.

This is good as my nephew has autism and sometimes it is hard to gauge which videos he will like.

This  was a good choice and delivery was fast.",1360800000,,244,4.041666666666667

5012391,4,B006PA188C,"This is the one dvd my son wanted when he saw me looking at stuff on the computer. So I said let's look for some more stuff and u can ask Santa for it. There were a few other things he found, but I would say this was his #1 pick. And it didn't disappoint. He absolutly loved watching it! He really likes Ben 10. He can tell u all the aliens and more. It was a great buy!",1357430400,,370,3.6962025316455698
5012392,5,B006PA188C,"Well done volume but would have really liked to have each season separately. Whatever, I wanted the series and this was just a minor glitch.",1355097600,,140,4.64
5012393,5,B006PA188C,"This disc nicely wraps up the lives of various characters ""met"" throughout the Ben 10 universe.  The actual ending is extremely well done and leaves room for further shows/movies with the same characters.  Overall, the entire Ben 10 concept is executed very well and is on par with the cartoons from the 80's.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction/fantasy cartoons.",1343088000,4,387,5.015625
