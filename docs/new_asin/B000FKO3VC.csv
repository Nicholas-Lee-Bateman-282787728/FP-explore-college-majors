2570264,4,B000FKO3VC,"Richard Basehart (Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea) is the man on the ledge. I thought he gave a great performance throughout.  I didn't really care for the psychology bit, but that doesn't take up much of the movie.  A few cuts to other things going on down on the street and in a building across the way (with Grace Kelly) add to the movie. Some film noir moments, but I don't know if I'd label it as film noir. Overall I enjoyed it and will definitely keep it in my collection and watch it more than once.",1206921600,5,507,4.111111111111111
2570265,4,B000FKO3VC,This black and white film is unusually good.  The movie is a real surprise.  I did not know the movie existed until I  watched it.  The film has several famous actors and actresses near the begining of their careers. Grace Kelly's performance was unexpected.  Some great acting and suspense.,1181606400,2,291,4.857142857142857
2570266,4,B000FKO3VC,"First, this isn't a film noir movie.  There is no mystery nor are any of the characters complex.  The story could not be simpler.  You won't be wondering who's lurking in the shadows or why the characters can't see the train wreck ahead.  No moral ambiguity.  No shades of gray.

Its a pretty good 1950s drama though, with a look like the superior, Naked City.  (It even has the same street sweeping scene at the end).  Richard Basehart plays a disturbed young man and Paul Douglas, a cop who tries to talk him out of jumping from a ledge.  You can guess the ending--after all, this is the 1950s.

The special effects are the real star as they create the suspense.  Paul Douglas is very good as the stereotypical street cop--a good Joe with a heart of gold who pounds a beat.  Richard Basehart is Richard Basehart.  He and Douglas exchange some chit chat about beer, fishing and why life is worth living.  Here is where the movie could have had brilliant insights but, asked to give 10 reasons why life is worth living, Paul Douglas says he never really thought of it that way.  That suits his character but its not terribly interesting.

There are incidental parts from Agnes Moorehead (who, of course would make anyone jump), a tiny sub plot with Grace Kelly, and some psychology 101 explaning why RB wants to end it all.  As night falls there are some great shots at the end giving the last 10 minutes a film noirish look.

Note that this disc has commentary by Foster Hirsch, not the unbelievably knowledgable Eddie Muller who's done most of the Fox Noir series.  Hirsch is apparently seeing the film for the first time and simply describes what you are watching as you are watching it.  He's silent much of the time and this is good.  The disc comes with a small booklet that, in a few paragraphs, covers far more than the commentary.

So, its pretty exciting, the direction and cinematography are very skillful.  But its not hard to see why this film wasn't considered for an academy award.",1160784000,12,1996,4.544943820224719
2570267,5,B000FKO3VC,"This cinema-verite account of a man hovering on the ledge of a high story New York hotel works on all cylinders.  Director Henry Hathaway masterfully weaves all the threads of the ensuing circus flawlessly.  From the police operation, the media hordes, the curiousity seekers on the ground, and ultimately to the scenes on the ledge we are kept enthralled throughout.  The film that this one brought to my mind is ""Dog Day Afternoon"" in it's portrayal of a media circus.  For this type of film to work there has to be a certain suspension of disbelief.  Despite the presence of some well known actors(Paul Douglas, Richard Basehart, Agnes Moorehead, Barbara Bel Geddes, et al) we are so caught up in the emotions of the events that we are led to believe them as real people.  Film is also of interest for some up-and-coming actors who blend seemlessly into the fabric of the film(Grace Kelly, Jeffrey Hunter, Ossie Davis, Harvey Lembeck).  ""Fourteen Hours"" definitely rates as an unqualified success.",1158451200,13,1000,4.916666666666667
2570268,5,B000FKO3VC,"The-man-on-the-ledge theme has been used in movies and on TV so often over the years that it has surely reached cliche status by now.
Director Henry Hathaway, however, in FOURTEEN HOURS (1951) guides the drama and urban tensions with such sure-handed craftsmanship, that this ledge jumper based film has remained almost as powerfully involving and suspenseful today as it was 55 years ago.
Furthermore, Hathaway gives FOURTEEN HOURS a master's touch by utilizing his own established and innovative semidocumentary style (see THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945); KISS OF DEATH (1947)). Thus, FOURTEEN HOURS, with its low-keyed black-and-white cinematography, effectively captures a segment of Manhattan's dramatically restless urban world in moody noir fashion.
And in addition, strong performances abound.
Especially noteworthy is Richard Basehart (the cause of all the commotion) as the disturbed 14hr. ledge occupant way way up on the fifteenth floor of a Manhattan hotel on St. Patrick's Day. (Actually, all this is based on a true incident; the film realistically depicts the sensationalistic media frenzy surrounding the event, with news-starved reporters everywhere, and some crude, insensitive behavior by numerous spectators).
Paul Douglas likewise shines in his role as a traffic cop who tries to keep Basehart from jumping.
Also, Barbara Bel Geddes is impressive (and eloquently gentle) as Basehart's former fiancee.
The many-faceted spectator emotions (some quite strong) on the street and surroundings set other little dramas in motion.
Here even Grace Kelly makes her film debut, as a maritally unhappy spectator observing and reacting to Basehart's plight above. Debra Paget and Jeffrey Hunter are also nearby.

By all means, add this fascinating and strongly fatalistic noir to your collection. Here are 5 stars to welcome its DVD appearance in such excellent condition.",1157068800,26,1881,5.576923076923077

2570311,5,B000FKO3VC,"I enjoyed the commentary by Foster Hirsch very much because it taught me a lot about the movie. Hirsch maintains that the real star of the film was director of photography Joe McDonald, and Hirsch consistently points out how the photography, empty space, and framing are used to convey meaning (about the emotional distance between characters and about the theme of emotional emptiness). His sharpest point comes about acting, however, when he says that Richard Basehart as the man on the ledge is giving a very good performance but essentially one of externals. We don't really get inside him as a character. Hirsch speculates on the fuller emotional range Basehart or maybe another actor (Clift or Brando or James Dean) might have conveyed had the director been someone like Elia Kazan rather than Henry Hathaway, whose hostility toward actors is well known. Hirsch also floats the idea that the unexplained motive for Basehart being on the ledge is that he is a repressed gay in a culture that wouldn't tolerate such sexuality. This may sound too ingenious to be believed, but actually Hirsch makes the point plausible and interesting (though some of his Freudian comments about the background shots of the Woolworth building suggesting a phallic symbol seem strained). The commentary is also strong on the process photography and how the location shots in New York are expertly matched to the studio work in Hollywood.",1402790400,,1422,5.05531914893617

2570313,5,B000FKO3VC,"A synopsis of this hugely riveting film can be briefly described as follows: a man contemplating suicide stands on a 15th floor hotel ledge for some 14 hours, during which various individuals attempt to dissuade him from jumping.

Of course, whether or not he will actually jump is a major concern of the viewer. And as the film progresses this concern increases as this man is revealed to be highly sympathetic. Initially, he is presented as a stranger, and his situation seems to be indicative of urban malaise and yet another instance of alienation common in contemporary society.

But incrementally, his character, personality, and history are conveyed to us. And now, we can begin to truly empathize with his plight - as we could easily be standing on the very same ledge if the circumstances of our own lives mirrored his. Accounts of the complicated personal relationships with his mother, father, and girlfriend are all related to the viewer; furthermore, all three characters are presented to enlighten us about this man's motivations.

Subordinate, seemingly tangential characters are introduced - eyewitnesses to this potentially devastating event. But they all have much significance: they depict different kinds of relationships - an incipient one, a reconciliation, a loving and nurturing one, and one of regret and embitterment. Relationships that our man-on-a-ledge shall never experience should he jump.

Providing a background to this man, i.e., individualizing him, greatly enriches this drama. His plight is a lonely and self-destructive one, but very optimistically, this film presents him as a member of a community - of the concerned, family and police alike, and of strangers, some hugely affected by his actions.

There is nary a caveat about this film, and very enthusiastic acclaim should be reserved for the direction, cinematography, and the highly impressive acting by all, especially, Richard Basehart and Paul Douglas, both of whom excel in practically every film in which they appear.",1381708800,,2017,5.310344827586207

We see scenes from a big city. A waiter brings a cart with food to a hotel room. The man leaves to stand on the ledge of this tall building. He threatens to jump if the police come near. A crowd gathers below to watch. More police arrive. Patrolman Donegan is sent back to traffic. A fire truck arrives; how high can it ladder go? A reporter uses a large-format camera. There is a big traffic jam on the streets below. [No traffic redirection plan?] One young woman wonders about his feelings. The traffic policeman returns to talk with the man (he has a down-to-earth honest attitude). The man on the ledge wants a glass of water, ""not too much ice"". The doctor adds a ""stimulant"" to the glass of water. Donegan drinks from the glass to show it OK. The police find out his name, but Robert resents this.

Robert asks for a cigarette. He usually doesn't smoke. The police research his parents. Will some bet on when the man jumps? Bobby's mother arrives, there is some problem. Has he been eating right?

This crisis is over. He wants to live, he needs rest and sleep. Mounted police disperse the crowd. A sanitation truck flushes the streets.

The producers thank the emergency rescue squad for the advice given for this movie. Does it promote a certain psychological point of view? Does it agree with your experiences in life?

2570316,4,B000FKO3VC,"This is yet another in the Fox Noir film series that really isn't noir at all. Still, it's very much a craft tour de force by all those involved, which includes an incredible number of subsequently famous actors who either debut in this film or receive largely uncredited bit roles. Paradoxically, I find it both quite flat and quite compelling. The grand story arc actually turns out to be quite uneventful -- for (one assumes) fourteen hours Richard Basehart remains on that building ledge and then comes the climax, which in a sense doesn't resolve much of anything. On the other hand, there are tense up-and-down moments as the police and others attempt to bring Basehart in off that ledge, moments that are tightly plotted and favored with excellent dialogue and equally skilled editing. The main story is complemented by other minor stories that are extraneous but not unrelated to the events surrounding Basehart's sitaution. The comments you will read elsewhere among these reviews about homosexuality being the film's veiled theme are cogent and, I think, completely right. Anyway, for a film that on a large scale doesn't seem to go anywhere, it actually provides quite a ride. Engaging, entertaining and engrossing, it has my strong recommendation.",1357948800,,1259,5.086956521739131

2570330,5,B000FKO3VC,"***SPOILERS***

Realizing what a technical `tour de force' this film is begins when one finds out that much of this film, though it looks like it was shot mostly on location in New York, was actually filmed in Fox's Studio, Stage 8.  What a superb job by all the crew, especially director Henry Hathaway, cinematographer Joe MacDonald, and film editor Dorothy Spencer.  I wouldn't be surprised to find that those with a fear of heights have difficulty watching it; it looks very realistic.

On the surface, our story involves Robert Cosick (Richard Basehart).  The film begins with a series of locational and studio shots that emphasize loneliness and desolation.  Soon, Cosick is outside his hotel room, on a ledge, which is on the 15th floor.  A woman's scream alerts Police Officer Charlie Dunnigan (Paul Douglas), who is on traffic detail at the time, that there is a `jumper'.  After a quick phone call into police headquarters, Dunnigan rushes to the scene, and is the first to usefully help Cosick.  One gets the feeling that he could have had him off the ledge had not the police (led by Howard Da Silva) started pouring into the room, exciting the high-strung Cosick.

The authorities and behavioural specialists try to establish who `the jumper' is and why he might be in trouble.  Eventually, Cosick's mother (Agnes Moorehead), his father (Robert Keith), and his ex-fiancee (Barbara Bel Geddes) are called up to talk to him.  Unfortunately, his mother and father are part of the reason that he is up there, and the apparent reason why his relationships all fail.

In a way, Cosick is there to counterpoint what is going on around him.  Being a film noir, there is a certain amount of cynicism.  But for all the selfishness, cynicism, and despair the film contains, there is also a lot of hope.  Grace Kelly, in her first role (a small one), was on her way to get a divorce finalized when she saw Cosick on the ledge and thought how her own situation was not really that bad: the couple reconcile.  Elsewhere Debra Paget and Jeffrey Hunter meet in the crowd and fall in love.  Hunter says that beautiful things can spring from the greatest tragedies:  he and Paget usually went to work at different times and never would have met otherwise.

On yet another level, this John Paxton screenplay is most assuredly, IMO, a critique of contemporary American society.  But it can also simply be savoured for the humanism and superb performance of Paul Douglas as Officer Dunnigan.",1284595200,3,2483,4.7952941176470585
2570331,4,B000FKO3VC,"I'm getting to like director Henry Hathaway more and more the more I see of his work, especially in film noir.  He pioneered the documentary aesthetic in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-House-on-92nd-Street/dp/B0009X766O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The House on 92nd Street </a>, an FBI-World War II spy movie from 1945, and carried that direct, relatively unadorned style forward in a series of solid crime films through the late 40s and into the early 50s, including at least one masterpiece, 1947's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-of-Death/dp/B000B83846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss of Death </a>.  Here a typical noir theme, hopelessness and isolation, is worked out in a different context, that of the attempted suicide.

Richard Basehart plays Robert Cosick, a troubled young man whose apparent problems with jobs, his divorced parents (Agnes Moorehead and Robert Keith), and an ex-girlfriend (Barbara Bel Geddes) have lead him to a perch on the 15th floor of a hotel, where only the sympathetic voice of an earthy beat cop (Paul Douglas) is keeping him from taking the fatal plunge.  The film expertly builds suspense over a quick 92-minute running time and, though Hollywood conventions dictate that the suicide of a sympathetic character is awfully unlikely, it certainly feels very real thanks to Hathaway's direct, no-nonsense approach, John Paxton's relatively naturalistic dialogue, and the terrific deep focus photography of Joe MacDonald along with an excellent set/design crew which really creates a believable New York hotel ambiance despite the shot-on-sets production.

What gives the film a ""noir"" quality is the cynicism and darkness of the secondary characters and little side plots, in particular the way it exposes the media sensationalism around the story.  While not as famous as the similarly dark ACE IN THE HOLE from the same year, and not nearly as fatalistic as a third 1951 noir dealing in human tragedy, THE WELL, Hathaway's film does build a solid case for the notion that most people are exploiters, most people in power anyway.  Cosick's mother and father are just as intent on dominating each other, and winning the boy's affection over the other parent as they are about saving him; most of the cops and the two psychologists involved seem to be interested in being the heroes, and most unpleasantly a priest who claims to be Cosick's turns out to be an unscrupulous sham.  At the same time the TV and radio stations are having a field day, a group of cabbies are betting on the hour in which the kid will take the plunge, and a young man (Jeffrey Hunter) uses the situation to make inroads on a pretty young woman (Debra Paget) who can't keep away from the scene.

Also featuring a very young Grace Kelly in her first role, as a woman completing divorce procedures who gets swept up in the story, this is an excellent example of a simple story put together with machine precision and plenty of heart.  Basehart excelled in a variety of damaged noirish protaganists and he's nervously vulnerable and appealing here, while Douglas is utterly convincing as the ordinary blue-collar cop called upon to step up to a momentary bit of greatness, and doing so not out of any sense of obligation or desire for fame and fortune, but just because - y'know, it's the thing to do.",1277769600,,3403,5.320297951582868

2570334,4,B000FKO3VC,"Warning: this review may contain spoilers>> The DVD contains some interesting commentary by film noir expert Foster Hirsch. His basic thesis is that what 14 Hours is really about is a crisis over masculinity. Hirsch argues that the subtext of the film is that the Richard Basehart character (""Robert Cosick"") is gay but in 1951, Hollywood was not permitted to deal with such gay themes explicitly. Hirsch makes some good points particularly in his description of Charlie Dunnigan, the down-to-earth cop (convincingly played by Paul Douglas) who is set up as a well-adjusted family man in contrast to the tormented Cosick.

14 Hours works on two levels. The primary level is the attempt by Dunnigan to get Cosick off the ledge and prevent him from killing himself. It's interesting that it's immediately apparent that Dunnigan has established a rapport with Cosick but the higher-ups (represented by the Police Captain played by Howard DaSilva) sends Dunnigan back to the street. Only once the two 'professionals' (the psychologists) are brought to the scene and realize that Cosick will only speak to Dunnigan that the brass have to eat crow and bring their 'inferior' back up to negotiate.

If the whole movie was just Dunnigan trying to sway Cosick, things would get pretty boring after awhile. But Screenwriter John Paxton mixes things up nicely by bringing in the three family members who try and coax the errant son/husband back to reality. Agnes Moorehead probably has the most interesting part in the movie as Cosick's semi-demented mother who just can't cut the strings. Then there's the passive alcoholic father played by Robert Keith (the real life father of well known actor, Brian Keith) who comes off as much more genuine than the spotlight-grabbing mother. Barbara Bel Geddes has the thankless role of being the good 'wife' who deep down knows she'll never have a sexual relationship with her husband ever again. There are other characters that add to the film's verisimilitude high above street level: the slew of cops who are continually trying to physically remove Cosick from his perch as well as the obsessed preacher, the 'man of God' who sabotages the rescue plan almost culminating in disaster!

The second level takes place 'below' the main action. On the street level, we're introduced to a group of 'everyman' characters. One of them is Mrs. Fuller (in Grace Kelly's first screen role). She's on her way up to her attorney to finalize divorce proceedings. Then there's the down-to-earth 'Ruth' (played by Debra Paget) who meets Danny (played by Jeffrey Hunter of 'Kings of Kings fame') in the gathering crowd who are staring up at the great passion play above. There's also a group of taxicab drivers (one of them is Ossie Davis in his first screen role) who represent the various ethnic types found in NYC. They cynically place bets on the exact time they expect Cosick to jump. Finally, there's the media--the reporters, both print and TV journalists who are covering the media event. Suffice it to say, the 'media' does not come off very well in this film.

14 Hours has a gripping story that moves along at a brisk pace. You'll find out from the DVD commentary that most if was filmed on a Hollywood sound stage but through expert editing, the NY scenes were inserted to make it look like the entire film was filmed in New York City. As I mentioned before, I agree with Foster Hirsch's central thesis that this is a film about a guy who doesn't trust his masculinity. Some of Hirsch's theories go a little too far, especially when he suggests that the Woolworth Building in the background is a phallic symbol. Furthermore I disagree with his view that the film takes a dim view of the psychologist who provides the 'psychological' explanation of Cosick's malady. Quite the contrary, psychoanalysis was all the rage at that time, especially in the movies, so when the explanation is offered that Cosick is suffering from an ""Oedipal Complex', and all his family members are depicted as contributing to Cosick's neurosis, it appears that the filmmakers seem to accept that line of reasoning.

14 Hours loses a bit of its luster with it advocacy of what it believes is 'normal'. While Cosick is saved, it's quite obvious that he'll always be 'damaged goods'. But most of the other characters get to live 'happily ever after'. The 'normal' couple go off in the sunset hand in hand, presumably to begin a 'normal' (1951 style) sexual relationship. Grace Kelly realizes that divorce isn't the answer and even the taxi drivers walk away from the most cynical of their lot. Dunnigan meets up with his son and we get a peek of his doting wife waiting outside the revolving doors at the front of the hotel.

14 Hours will never win awards for tolerance of 'alternative lifestyles'. But as a taut, gripping, little thriller, it can be surely termed an 'oldie but goodie'.",1261008000,2,4889,4.877256317689531

2570337,4,B000FKO3VC,"`Fourteen Hours' is a far better film than one might think it to be.  It reminds me a tad of `Phone Booth' in that it rarely leaves the small confines of a particular area, and it stars really only two people (sure there are other actors, but their roles are limited to a few select scenes); and like `Phone Booth', it is never boring.

The film tells of a man named Robert Cosick who causes an uproar on St. Patrick's Day when he decides to attempt suicide by jumping out of his hotel window.  Before he can plummet though, he is spotted and a traffic cop makes his way to his room to try and coax him down.  Robert is shaky and nervous and dangerously unnerved, but the cop, Charlie, is calming and gentle.  When Robert makes it clear he'll talk to no one but Charlie, Charlie winds up spending the next fourteen hours trying desperately to find out why this man is trying to kill himself and how he can work to prevent it.

I won't lie to you; this is a film that does feel a little dated.  The way in which the try and rescue Robert is a little out of date; but when you look at the film in the whole context of `this was made in the 50's' then you can easily look past that dated material.

In fact; the script is the films brightest moment.

The acting is spotty here though.  The two leads are at total opposite spectrums here.  It reminds me of `Strangers on a Train' in the fact that one lead is flawlessly captivating and the other is just off; totally.  Paul Douglas nails his portrayal of Police Officer Charlie Dunnigan.  He has this natural charm and grace that makes his character easy to listen to and easy to love.  It's no wonder that Robert only wants to deal with Charlie.  He exudes this genuineness that draws you to him.  Richard Basehart on the other hand is so mechanical he's off putting.  All his ticks and shakes and heavy handed depression just seems so fake to the viewer.  I only wish he had the same natural progression of character that Douglas had.

The supporting cast is hit or miss as well.  Barbara Bel Geddes and Agnes Moorehead have two very different characters and they both handle them rather well.  Moorehead especially is effective as Robert's attention hungry mother.  I thought that Robert Keith was slightly bland as Robert's `never there' father Paul, but he isn't really given that much to work with.

The nice thing about the script is that it touches upon how one outlandish act can bring a lot of people together and change their outlook on life in general.  On the ground, as the crowd watching the spectacle grows, we are given a glimpse at love blossoming amidst the nervous curiosity; and we even see a marriage on the rocks given new life as the party ponders the blessing that life really is.  It's subtle and it could have been developed a little better (and deeper) but it's a nice touch that adds an extra layer to the film.  I also like the fact that, while Robert's life is explored and explained, his intentions for killing himself are never truly revealed.  The ambiguity adds a sharp realization that sometimes it's something very small and seemingly insignificant that can make us feel like we cannot go on.

It can affect anyone at just about anytime.

The film is very well done and nicely crafted.  If only both leads were as dynamically effective as Douglas this could have been a near perfect movie.  Still, it is very enjoyable, tense and memorable.  It's one of those movies you've probably never heard of but should seek out.

I think they call these `hidden gems'.",1236038400,3,3541,4.465732087227415
2570338,5,B000FKO3VC,"Fourteen Hours is an interesting 1951 film about the efforts of a New York police officer  played by Paul Douglas  to stop a despondent man  Richard Basehart  from jumping from a building ledge. The otherwise fictional story was inspired by an actual standoff in New York in 1938 between police and a man attempting suicide, which drew crowds of bystanders and media coverage as hours went by. The film has a happy ending, in which the young man is saved by being caught in nets set up below him. In the actual standoff, New York City Patrolman Charles V. Glasco of Woodhaven, Queens strived in vain to convince John Warde that life was worth living. Glasco pretended to be a bellhop at the Gotham Hotel, and tried to persuade Warde that a suicide would be bad for business at the hotel. As the most recent hired, Glasco would be the first one let go if business at the hotel suffered. Although Warde was initially sympathetic to the plight of the bellhop who would lose his job if the hotel lost business, he eventually jumped.

The screenplay was written by John Paxton, based on an article by Joel Sayre in The New Yorker, and was directed by Henry Hathaway. It co-starred Barbara Bel Geddes, and was the first movie for both Grace Kelly and Jeffrey Hunter, who have supporting roles.

There s some interesting multi-character drama in this piece cutting between the dramas on the Hotel window ledge, taxi drivers in the street, the cops trying to get Richard Basehart to come down, the despondent, dominant mother and the father who previously left, the fianc, a potential divorcee who eventually patches things up with her husband and a young couple who meet out in the street watching the events unfold in the crowd.. It is obvious the screenwriters considered the Window Ledge drama contained too little drama to sustain the suspense and tension for a complete movie and so expanded the story to include minor characters surrounding this story with their own stories all of which link into the main story in some way..

I've always been intrigued by this kind of story with this kind of premise.. There aren't many of these types of movies around with this kind of main premise, its pretty unique and for that alone this oddity is well worth adding to your collection.. Some great photography in this too.. Great little movie...",1209945600,,2335,4.722358722358722

A young man in distress steps out onto the ledge of his hotel 15 stories above the street. A beat cop sees him and rushes into action. A young couple watch below. Mother and father plead  with the young man. His former girlfriend is called. The tension is built skillfully to the breathtaking climax. Today it is clear what is troubling the young man on the ledge. The subject was taboo when the film was made but handled sensitively. This film deserves to be recognized as an incredible work for many reasons. The excellent cast includes Paul Douglas in an amazing performance, as well as Richard Basehart, Agnes Morehead, Barbara Bel Geddes, Jeffrey Hunter, and Grace Kelly's first but very impressive screen appearance. The musical score only enhances the mood. Nothing more to be said.",1481068800,,938,4.8625

8124058,5,B000FKO3VC,"EXCELLENT! I was impressed by this little known 1951 black and white film. With a great cast and strong scenario, this is a real gem, worth discovering. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

In a New York City hotel an initially anonymous young man (Richard Basehart) walks out of the window and stands on the narrow ledge outside his room - on the fifteenth floor! He is noticed and Charlie Dunnigan (Paul Douglas), a police officer, who was working traffic duty near the hotel, arrives and tries to persuade him to come back into the room. He doesn't succeed, but ultimately the young man refuses to speak to anybody else than Dunnigan. What follows is the story of dramatic and tense efforts to save the life of a young man - who gets more and more tired and more and more desperate. The effort will include a research into his past... As an enormous crowd gathers around and the media get into the feeding frenzy, the film tells also the story of some of the people who watch the events from the street and the surrounding buildings.

I never heard about this film before and I am a little surprised that it is nowadays so totally forgotten. I was very impressed by the high quality of the scenario and the terrific performance of all the cast. Henry Hathaway was already an experienced director in 1951 and it immediately shows in this film  it is only 92 minutes, but it is so well organised and filled with events, that it seems longer. That is not a criticism  I appreciated every single scene and my only regret is that there was no more of them! The scenario is very strong, but I will say nothing about the details. The tension builds up and drama become more and more intense, especially towards the end, as there are surprises and scares, which I didn't see coming at all. This film kept me constantly on the edge (sorry for that, I couldn't resist). Finally, the ending is unexpected  and very powerful indeed

The cast is incredible. Paul Douglas and Richard Basehart are the main stars here and a great deal of the screen time is devoted to their conversation/negotiation/confrontation. Veteran actors Agnes Moorehead and Robert Keith appear in the middle of the film  another highly experienced actor, Howard Da Silva, plays deputy chief Moskar, the leading policeman assigned to the crisis. Young actresses Barbara Bel Geddes and especially Debra Paget appear also as well as two future great stars: Grace Kelly and Jeffrey Hunter  for both of them it was the first credited appearance on the screen. All actors did an amazing job, including those, mostly not credited, who appear in brief cameos in the street crowd, commenting (sometimes rudely) on the whole drama

I didn't see the 2012 remake (""Man on the ledge"") with Sam Worthington, but from what I read about it the story was completely changed and therefore the film was not a success  therefore even if you saw it, you can still watch ""Fourteen hours"" and expect to be surprised.

I was very impressed by this film and I will absolutely keep the DVD for another viewing. ENJOY!",1464739200,,3077,4.67962962962963
