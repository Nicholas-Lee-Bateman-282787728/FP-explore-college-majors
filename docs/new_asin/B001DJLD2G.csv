3532616,5,B001DJLD2G,"Superman 1 & 2 are great, 3 is so-so and 4 was horrendous, but if you are a Christopher Reeve fan, none of that will matter much.  Great price for the compilation with no frills.",1243382400,,178,4.085714285714285
3532617,5,B001DJLD2G,For any fan of superman this is an excellent deal...and if you are just a superhero movie fan...then three outta four ain't bad...especially for the price.  The quest for peace being the weakest link in this four film set makes the purchase a no brainer.  You don't get the ultra spiffy re-edited Donner cut of superman 2....but Zod still rules..and the original is still a great version of the film.,1241568000,,400,4.7
3532618,5,B001DJLD2G,"When I picked this up in the store I had to do a double-take.  All 4 Superman movies for $9.99?  Maybe I was missing something.  But no, it really was all 4 movies for just ten bucks!

The set is made up of two double-sided DVDs, with one movie on each side.  The transfer of the sound and picture seemed fine to me.  And there's plenty of bonus stuff here too: documentaries, commentaries, trailers, etc.  But it was great to just sit down and watch each film in its entirety, which I haven't done in years.

The only reason I can possibly think of for not buying this set, is that maybe there's already another Superman DVD set with even more bonus material or they're planning yet another set soon.  But if you aren't a die-hard completist, this set is all you need.  And you can't go wrong with the price.",1241395200,6,809,4.298013245033113
3532619,4,B001DJLD2G,"Christopher Reeve is an iconic favorite with Superman 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Holy Smokes!

Superman 1 is the ""standard"" version, with the death of Krypton and the baby saying hi to the Kents for the first time, still sends chills.  Gene Hackman is, well, Gene Hackman.  I really hope in future films they don't make the evil Luthor such a joke.

Superman 2 is the best, great fight scenes against the evil Kryptonian criminals.

Superman 3 (From Amazon Reviews, sorry): ""Here was a case in which the progenitors of this successful comic-book adaptation figured they had to go in a new direction--and chose the wrong one. For starters, they recruited comedian Richard Pryor, who was the kiss of death for almost every movie he was in except his own concert films.  --Marshall Fine""

And Superman 4, the worse of the bunch, which had more slapstick and comedy elements with the return of Hackman and though trying to tell a positive message regarding nuclear war, just did not get off the launching pad.

DVD is mundane at its best.  The movies are on the flip sides of two DVDs and the only specials are trailers and some background commentaries.

Recommended for those who haven't seen these films in a long time.",1237075200,2,1206,4.668246445497631
3532620,4,B001DJLD2G,Nowhere are you going to get a better deal than on this here. You get all the Superman films that starred the late Christopher Reeve in one collection that is more than 1/2 off the standard collection price. The only downfall is being only on 2 discs and being double sided. That is why I only give it a 4 star rating. Don't let that deter you from buying this great item though because it is a great collection still and at the price of 13.99 it's a must have. Just have to be a little extra careful handling the discs.,1236470400,20,520,4.158415841584159
3532621,5,B001DJLD2G,"For those who still don't believe that a man can fly, this four-DVD pack provides a wonderful opportunity for children of any age who haven't yet discovered the timeless magic of the late Christopher Reeve's performance as the legendary Man of Steel.

The four films (I-1978, II-1981, III-1983, and IV-1987) are presented here double-sided (I/II) and (III/IV) in their theatrical release form.  Each movie will features a trailer and a producer's commentary, in addition to a few extra goodies (i.e. tv commercials, a ""Superman III"" documentary, and some deleted scenes).  Perhaps the best deleted scene is from ""Superman II,"" offering a rare glimpse inside the Fortress of Solitude as Lois gently offers Superman a few baking tips.  Its amusing romantic context is much appreciated as an added attraction.

In terms of rating the film with their extras:

""Superman: The Movie"": *****
""Superman II"": **** 1/2
""Superman III"": ***
""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"": ** 1/2

Overall: **** (plus an additional * for the generously low cost).",1229904000,65,1038,5.179640718562874

3532623,4,B001DJLD2G,"All films are the original theatrical releases.

Superman is very good. Superman II, Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest For Peace, are not as good, yet they have their moments.

My opinion is that Superman II, could have been the best in the series.

Also, check out, Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut and Superman: Special Edition (with additional footage).

3532675,3,B001DJLD2G,"I have this set. I just got it at Cracker Barrel. This 4-pack contains the first 4 Superman movies from the 1978 series. Of course, we don't have Supergirl (if you didn't know what that was, it was released in 1984, and even though it had ties with these movies, I heard it was horrible, and it was probably why it didn't do well in the box office) and Superman Returns (the Superman movie before the DC Extended Universe). I haven't watched them yet, but going through them, I've seen that they're pretty good quality (I've used my laptop with Cyberlink, so I didn't expect the picture to be too good for any of my DVDs). I know that it isn't important, but the chapter selection is pretty vivid, unlike MOST OF WARNER BROS. RELEASES PAST 2010. The special features I haven't tried yet, because I have yet to see the movies, but the selection is good. The first movie has a trailer & TV spot (if you're into nostalgia). The second movie has deleted scenes and the trailer. The fourth movie is about the same, so does the third movie, however the latter also has a Making of documentary, so that's a nice surprise. The sound quality choices are mixed, as the original English version has Dolby 5.1 on the first two movies, while the last two movies are Dolby Stereo. The French dub has regular Stereo for the first movie, regular Mono for the second movie, and Dolby Stereo for the last two, so if you're like a Canadian French audiophile, then this would be a slap in the face. What I don't like about this set, is the misleading information about the discs. Two double-sided discs are bad enough, considering that one scratch could damage the whole disc, so your child better be careful with those discs. What's inside the case, you may ask? No double sided discs. Just 4 DVDs that came straight out of their special editions (like Disc 1 of both Superman and Superman II Special Editions), all in a stack. Believe me, stacks are bad when putting the discs in the right place. If you're not careful, you could put fingerprints on the discs, or worse, scratch them, and you or any child wouldn't want that. This was before the modern way of ""disc storage in case"" was prevalent for multi-disc releases. All in all, I expect you to be careful with these DVDs, because you don't want your disc to skip in any way. And to Warner Bros., if this was me from when this set was released, I would say ""Screw you""!",1504137600,,2406,4.458049886621315

3532680,4,B001DJLD2G,"""Four Film Favorites: Superman"" is best for completists who want to own all of Christopher Reeve's appearances as the Man of Steel in one convenient, low-priced package. Others will be better off owning just ""Superman: The Movie"" and ""Superman II"" and ignoring both subsequent films.

Indeed, this collection might be called ""Superman: The Diminishing Returns Collection.""

It starts, of course, with ""Superman: The Movie,"" which vaulted Christopher Reeve from obscurity to stardom, made us believe a man could fly, and established the superhero film genre as we know it today. The film blends action, light comedy, and cliches from both romantic comedies and newspaper movies.

""Superman II"" wasn't so much a sequel to ""Superman: The Movie"" as a continuation of it. It continues the stories of Lois Lane's relationships with both Superman and his civilian identity of Clark Kent; of archvillain Lex Luthor; and of the three Kryptonian criminals Superman's birth father, Jor-El, exiled to the Phantom Zone, from which they escape to challenge the Action Ace. In addition, it also continues the light comedy approach to Superman and the excellent special effects that made the first film memorable.

Then, the downhill skid begins with ""Superman III,"" which drops the actors, characters and plot threads of the first two films for new villains Robert Vaughn, as a typical mad billionaire who wants to control the world's crops, and Richard Pryor as a befuddled computer programmer who tries to aid him. After Luthor's scheme to sink California and the Kryptonian criminals' attempt to take over Earth by brute force, it's tough to care about Vaughn, Pryor or their plan. And Annette O'Toole fared much better as Martha Kent in the later ""Smallville"" TV series than she does here as Superman's boyhood sweetheart, Lana Lang.

Last and certainly least, the wheels fall completely off the wagon with ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,"" which is distinguished by bargain-basement special effects of the type usually seen in the hapless no-budget films that get riffed on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000.""  And it's not just the special effects that suffered from the nickel-nursing approach of Cannon Films, which had purchased the Superman rights from Alexander and Ilya Salkind.  A scene that was supposed to feature the Man of Steel walking down New York's 42nd Street to deliver a speech at the United Nations instead became a stroll through an industrial park in England (!!!), with trained pigeons added for atmosphere (!!!). It's certainly well-intentioned, based as it is on Reeve's idea that Superman should be involved in nuclear disarmament, but good intentions are merely pavement on this particular path to cinematic hell.

Since the first two Reeve Superman films more than compensate for the weaknesses of the final two, I give this release four stars, with the provision that it's best for those who want all four films.",1499212800,4,2929,5.177589852008457

3532703,5,B001DJLD2G,"Back when Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars, and Space Academy were wowing kids of all ages with unheard of special effects for the time, along came Christopher Reeves as Superman! In Superman The Movie, it shows the origins of the Man of Steel and how he came to Earth as a baby and grew up in small town America to move on to Metropolis and finally become Superman! Lex Luthor, played by Gene Hackman, gains nuclear bombs and decides to nuke California! In Superman 2, my personal favorite, 3 villains from Krypton, Superman's home planet which was destroyed and why he was evacuated to Earth, escape from the Phantom Zone, a Kryptonian interdimensional type of prison/jail and Superman must fight them to the death! All 3 have the same abilities as Superman and with Lex Luthor at their side, it turns into one of the best superhero fights in movie history! In Superman 3, get out the laugh meter as Richard Pryor guest stars as a funny yet dangerous computer expert that designs a supercomputer that gives AI a whole new meaning. A rather murderous meaning. No Brainiac included but probably not needed. In Superman 4, we get to see one of the few times when Superman is nearly and permanently defeated by an opponent. Lex Luthor uses DNA research to create a form of Superman of his own and picks a fight with Superman. The results are shocking! Definitely a close fight! Looking past the third movie, this is a good collection for people who like superhero action, especially movie 2 and most of movie 4. All are rated PG for minor violence, language, and innuendo.",1492992000,3,1569,4.688405797101449

3532911,4,B001DJLD2G,"In the copy I was sent, Superman II is unplayable. As far as I'm concerned, all four movies are worthwhile viewing. I remember seeing Superman I when it came out in the late '70s. It had an overwhelming effect on me. I walked out of the theater utterly mesmerized Superman had been merely a comic-book & radio ""hero"" when I was a kid during the '40s. The TV program in the '50s was second-rate to me - but in this film Superman was NOT fiction, he was very REAL!!!

I am about the same age as Superman, having been born in 1935, so I have read many of the comic books (unfortunately kept none of them) including many of the other heroes of the time that also came out. My favorite actually was Capt. Marvel, who was the most popular of all the super-heroes at the time. The radio programs I really enjoyed & have never forgotten the voice used for Superman - it sounded like the voice a super hero should have.

I am really very disappointed a movie has not bee filmed starring Capt. Marvel.",1423958400,3,991,4.294117647058823

3532939,5,B001DJLD2G,"This Superman 4-Film Favorites has all the Superman films that you need wherein Christopher Reeve starred as Superman and Clark Kent.

*Superman: The Movie is definitely the best movie about the caped crusader hero as it stands still. It combines drama,humor,tension and suspense in one complete package. Aside from that,the casting was perfect from Marlon Brando as Jor-El,Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor,Margot Kidder as Lois Lane and of course,Christopher Reeve ,who turned out an iconic performance as the both the bumbling Clark Kent and the hero,Superman. This film has the themes of Superman's character,humanity and his vulnerability.

*Superman II is a great follow-up to the first film considering that it retains all the delightful characteristics that the first movie has like adventure,tension,suspense and humor. Also,this one goes deeper into the love story between Superman and Lois Lane as well as the sacrifices each one is willing to go forward into their relationship; and the battle between Superman and the Supervillains.

*Superman III may have turned more into a slapstick comedy especially with comic Richard Pryor's presence. It definitely has changed its direction but nevertheless,it still manages to provide entertainment with the Clark Kent returning to Smallville and having a new love interest in Lana Lang and witnessing a great performance from Christopher Reeve,who proved himself to be have great acting skills when portraying the good and evil Superman.

*Superman IV:The Quest For Peace could probably the least interesting film that Christopher Reeve has done as Superman but  nevertheless,it still has great themes about World Peace.",1413072000,,1668,5.525490196078431

3532952,5,B001DJLD2G,"I recieved the DVD of the 4 films of Superman starring Christopher Reeves and it was in good condition, I received it on time and I gave it as a gift to my grandson so we could watch it together. These superman films, in my opinion are the best supermans especially for children. They don't have a darkness, wicked and depressing tone to them. I believe that Christopher Reeves is the best superman, his portrayal of the bumbling Clark Kent is natural. The dynamic portrayal of Superman is powerful and captivating. His voice is gentle and sincere, when he is on the screen no one is watching anyone else but him. So parents and children alike enjoy watching him play out the adventures of good vs bad (evil) through all 4 films. My grandson is almost 3 and there are a few scenes where I sped up the film, he is not mature for some scenes. Since my grandson has seen superman, he wants to do good and help people. He even wears a little superman shirt to daycare. He is helping the kids at daycare when they drop their toys, or need help in anyway. Before this film, he didn't know the difference of good and bad (evil). The behavior of the bad guys, Lex Luthor and his group, my grandson knows now ""not"" to take things from other people, not to go with bad people, and not to hurt people. So my family enjoyed these 4 films.",1405555200,2,1326,4.329317269076305

So I finally figured I should check out this super-famous movie series that came first, especially with such a tempting price. (Not that this didn't come after the George Reeves series and all the comics, but oh well.)

I liked these. Like most people, I found the first two much better than the second two. Admittedly, it is pretty hard to accept someone as Superman when you have been in love with two other Supermans, especially when you have been watching the one (Tom Welling!) for going on 10 years! And I still collect Dean Cain movies.

I wondered one thing. Did the plots of these movies not even go together? What was up with Lois knowing Clark's secret in movie #2 and them being in love, and in movie #3 she didn't know and Clark was back in Smallville dating Lana? (Although it was awesome that Annette O'Toole, Martha Kent from ""Smallville,"" was Lana.) Or did Superman have the power of amnesia? I wasn't sure. He seemed to again in movie #4. If so, that's kind of weird, not to mention disturbing, especially that he would use it!

Well, for the most part, these movies were pretty enjoyable and I am happy to have them. As for #4, even though the plot was a bit silly... what a shame we don't have our own Superman to rid the world of nuclear weapons.",1334448000,2,1824,5.530465949820789

3533182,5,B001DJLD2G,"To see all four of them together is a delight, I received this as a Christmas gift from my sister. #1 maybe the best movie ever made if you ask me.  The director's commentary shares the difficulty of what it took to get the flying scenes to work.  I had not even realized what he was talking about until he mentioned it, very good considering this was all pre-CGI. He also mentions that it is Chris Reeves doing the voice talking to Air Force One, interesting.  I always laugh when I see Ned Beaty as Otis at the beginning.

I laugh when Clark says.""I abhore any form of violence."" Just a great flick.  A suprise to see Larry Hagaman as the military guy doing mouth-to-mouth, just before he became J.R. Ewing.

The director said the Lois Lane death was taken from the second movie which was being filmed at the same time.

And, we can not forget Marlon Brando as Jor'el.  He wanted the same $ to appear in #2 as he got for #1 so they said nope. I read he was on set for 18 days.

#2

A sad tale, shot by a different director though it is virtually impossible to tell, Zod is a jerk. It just doesn't have the same feel.
There is a deleted scene. Great interaction with Clark and Lois at end. Also, we were unaware of the ability he has to peal off his symbol and ensnare people.

#3

Is a Richard Pryor vehicle because he renacted #1 on 'The Tonight Show' for Johnny Carson. Robert Vaughn is hardly menecing.  We do get an idea of the Brainiac chracter.  The extra cents idea of Pryor's 'Gus' is good enough that they use the idea in the movie 'Office Space', which says more about the lameness of that movie that it apes another movie.

#4

Is weak, even the graffics at the start are...poor.  Chris wanted to do an anti-nuke movie from his position of strength, and good for him, but in the end it does not work, not even for Superman. New younger characters are added to the mix as it was felt Chris and Co. were too long in the tooth. An additional some-what comedic character was edited out and for good reason, he was terrible.

3533187,5,B001DJLD2G,"I have forever been a Superman fan, and the reason why was the Christopher Reeves orignal.  I am not going to say it is the best or my favorite, but it is definately the baseboard for the entire Superman canon, as well as the superhero genre even to this day.  It is one of the most important movies of all time, because it took a subject in comic books and made it something for all people to aspire to.  I have read criticisms that the Clark was too much of a bumbling idiot, and that the bad guys should be just afraid of Clark as a reporter who tries to right wrong in the public eye as they are of Superman's powers, but it really does speak to a different part of us as an audience that we have something inside of us that is special and even though the world may look at us as bafoons, we eventually can get the girl and change the world around us for the better.  The second film is a little butchered, though still a really fun watch.  I would recommend any fan to getting the Richard Donner Director's cut of it, as the first and second film were shot back to back by Donner, but then the studio pulled out and brought in a new director to shoot different scenes for the theatrical release that is not nearly as good, but still am glad that I have both versions, and I have to say that there are some nastalgic reasons as the original is the version that I grew up with.  The third film is pretty much unwatchable garbage, that casts Richard Prior as a comic relief, but the movie is epicly bad.  I think that it made audiences think twice before going to see the fourth one, which did the worst theatrically, though I don't think it was that bad.  I think its on par with the original second film, but maybe thats just because its the only one that I got the chance to see in theatres as a child.  i had ordered the box set of these films back when it was available but it became unavailable shortly afterwards before amazon got me a copy, so I eventually setled for this.  The movies come in a single case, on two discs, with one film on each side of the disc.  Not having the original releases I can't say if there were any special features there, but they are very lacking here.  I generally really like the film favorites collections as they are usually small niche films that audiences like to remember without paying full price for, and I guess I just think more highly of this franchise, even if I really only love the orignal, they all have a special place in my childhood and I would reccomend passing that on and keeping that fantastic dream alive.",1307232000,,2569,4.241803278688525

3533194,4,B001DJLD2G,"This budget, 2 disc, DVD-18 set has the first four Superman movies starring the late Christopher Reeve.

Superman The Movie(1978): Jor-El of the doomed planet Krypton sends his son Kal-El to Earth so he'll have a chance to live. On Earth, he's adopted by Johnathan and Martha Kent. Kal-El is given the human name Clark Kent and he grows up to be Superman.
Superman must save the people of California after Lex Luthor is planning a diabolical, real estate scam that'll kill millions of people! Superman was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. They also created Slam Bradley.

Superman II(1980): Kryptonian outlaws General Zod(Terence Stamp), Ursa , and Non are endowed with superpowers and they try to conquer Earth! Clark Kent must regain his superpowers in order to save the world.

Superman III(1983): Superman III was a sign that the magic in the Superman film franchise was vanishing! The script tries to capitalize on comedian Richard Pryor and Superman is a co-star in his own movie! Pryor plays Gus Gorman, a computer genius exploited by a rich megalomaniac(Robert Vaughn). The Man of Steel must save the world from Gorman's psychotic supercomputer! Superman III isn't a total failure. Annette O' Toole is superb as Lana Lang and Christopher Reeve was in good shape at the time. Superman's Jekyll and Hyde duel in an automobile graveyard is riveting!

Superman IV The Quest for Peace(1987): This film was so bad that it took 19 years for another Superman movie(Superman Returns) to get made. Also, over an hour of footage was cut out before the film reached movie theaters! Superman IV's visual effects are very cheesy and the film's damsel-in-distress is somehow able to breath in the vacuum of outer space! Superman also recycles too many ideas from the last three movies. Lois Lane attempts to speak French and Superman and Lois fly around the world as 'Can You Read My Mind' plays on the soundtrack. Still, Christopher Reeve gives a sincere performance as the Man of Steel. Alexander Courage does a good job adapting John Williams' Superman music into his own music score.

3533196,5,B001DJLD2G,"My husband is a Superman fan, and his mother bought him this set for the holidays. We've watched 3 out of 4 of the movies so far, and while the plot gets progressively worse and the special effects are awful, they are must-have Superman classics that were made 30 years ago.

I then bought this for my difficult-to-shop-for father and he was happy and excited to receive this. He didn't have all of these movies, and the ones he had, he didn't have them on DVD (only on VHS), so now he can watch them all.

My husband and father were both happy with this DVD set, so I would recommend this as a perfect guy-gift. (Not to mention the really great price and free great shipping).

If for no other reason, it's fun to watch these movies and laugh at the appalling, overly abundant greenscreen/bluescreen usage (with the wire used for flying often visible), terrible graphics, groan-worthy plot-lines, and  the awful racial stereotypes (particularly in the 3rd movie).

### ABOUT THE 4 FILM FAVORITES SERIES ###

Warner Brothers/New Line's ""4 Film Favorites"" is a line of two-disc sets consisting of four films that are part of a series/franchise or center around a common theme.  Each disc is dual-sided, with the contents of each side being a bit-for-bit copy (a ""disc image"") of a previous DVD release.  Usually the very first DVD release of a film is used as the master for each side, which could be either single-layer or dual-layer.  If the DVD master that is used first came out at the infancy of DVD production (the late 1990s), there may be little to no extras, and even a poor film transfer when compared to a later re-release.  Also, if that original release was a two-disc set, or a dual-sided disc (see: Lethal Weapon 4), only Disc 1 or Side A will be used.  The ""4 Film Favorites"" line is priced with the budget-conscience consumer in mind, with Target having the lowest price at 9.99 each (occasionally on sale for 8.99).  Other stores will inevitably be priced higher, though I don't recommend paying more than ten dollars for each two-disc set.

3533214,3,B001DJLD2G,"The good news, for a very good price, you get the first four ""Superman"" movies starring Christopher Reeve, in their original theatrical cuts.

The bad news, in addition to the excellent 1st film and solid 2nd movie, you're also gonna get stuck with the disappointing 3rd movie and the godawful 4th movie.

Furthermore, you don't get the 2006 Richard Donner Cut of ""Superman II"" that dug up older footage to reassemble the movie as close to the intended version as they could.  Also, completists won't get ""Superman Returns"", although that's a pretty inexpensive DVD to grab these days.

In case you care, I think ""Superman: The Movie"" (1978) is a marvelous piece of entertainment, that only suffers from being a little too long (trimming 10 minutes down to a 2hr-10min picture would've made everything tighter, I think).

The 1980 version of ""Superman II"", to be fair, was very good for its time.  However, the sillier elements are made worse since we found out over time that there was another version that was mostly finished before the producers fired Richard Donner (director of the 1st movie).  Still, the second movie retains a lot of the fun and character that made ""Superman"" so much fun to begin with.

I will always enjoy ""Superman III"" (1983) as a comedy, but to quote my brother, Superman is a guest star in his own movie.  After finishing and reshooting ""Superman II"", Richard Lester was hired to deliver this third outing.  I'm afraid that although there are some fine elements to it (Clark Kent visits Smallville, and later becomes an evil doppelganger), the movie can't possibly be taken seriously.  I enjoy the movie, but admit that it's not really a Superman feature.

In fact, ""Superman IV: The Quest For Peace"" (1987), as dreadful as it is, is more of a Superman movie than the 3rd movie.  However, due to the well-documented troubles in production, this 4th movie is a catastrophe.  This whole mess is filled with a non-sensical plot, silly scenes, ridiculous villains, and literally impossible action sequences (wait till the evil Nuclear Man kidnaps the damsel in distress...to the Moon!).  Aside from a good scene here and there, the best way to enjoy this one is to create a drinking game around it...... and I don't drink.

We can all be grateful to Warner Bros. for letting Superman be treated with the great balance of seriousness and adventure so that future superhero stories could be later released as feature films.  But we can also condemn Warner Bros. for letting an iconic character be so poorly handled.  I dunno, half of this 4-disc sert is good, the other is a letdown.  Flip a coin, I guess.

""Superman: The Movie"" (1978) = 9.0 / 10
""Superman II"" (1980) = 7.0 / 10
""Superman III"" (1983) = 5.5 / 10

All of these films are absolutely outstanding, the plots are somewhat predictable, but for the great story of Superman, you don't get a better actor than Christopher Reeve. And for a villain, how much more fun can you get than Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor?

The films come on two flipper discs with one film on each side. Packaging could be better and will bother some folks, but if you take care of your discs and be careful about fingerprints, the dvd's should last a long time. The quality is great each film is from the seperate dvd release transfers which are very good. This is a great value for some classic films.",1271548800,2,675,4.443548387096774

3533220,5,B001DJLD2G,"This collection of all 4 Superman movies is a mixed bag. I give this collection the full rating because of the first two movies. ""Superman: The Movie"" & ""Superman II"" are classics. Sadly, Richard Donner was fired during filming of ""Superman II,"" and as a result, the final cut of the picture is a mixed bag. The next film, ""Superman III,"" was advertised as ""The best time yet."" HAH. Casting Richard Pryor was an idiotic choice, as his character was used for comic relief (and he was a MAIN CHARACTER), and the movies are about SUPERMAN (who was completely upstaged by Pryor) and his relationship with Lois Lane (who was sadly reduced to a two minute cameo). There WAS one good scene (I can't say what it is, for fear of revealing a major plot point, but I can say that it's a fight scene). Had Donner directed this film (and had the script been better), this film would have been a huge success (though it DID have some good scenes, but the movie itself could have been much better). Same thing goes for ""Superman IV,"" which was almost downright apalling. Great story (co-written by Christopher Reeve) and good supporting casting (Mariel Hemingway & Jon Cryer), but a very mediocre script. A 90 MINUTE ""SUPERMAN MOVIE?!!! NO WONDER it was partly the reason for the movie's bombing at the box office. Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando and Margot Kidder were excellent, as were the supporting cast members. The deleted scene from ""Superman II"" should have been kept in, as a further example of the director's ineptitude to direct a good movie with a strong script (which is what Mr. Donner had, but the idiot the producers to direct hired ruined the film with all his nonsensical reshooting). Several deleted scenes from ""Superman III"" were good (excluding those with Pryor, with the exception of a scene which explains why Vera calls her brother ""Bubba""). The deleted scenes from ""Superman IV"" are atrocious, especially the ones with the first Nuclear Man. Had Donner directed the remaining movies, I think they would have been much better than they turned out. Shame he was fired midway through filming of ""Superman II."" The last two films are atrocious.

All the films are rated PG.",1260835200,,2196,4.778947368421052
