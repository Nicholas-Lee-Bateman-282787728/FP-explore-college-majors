2994298,5,B000X0IKZ4,"I had no idea when I selected ""Dororo"" from the Comcast-on-Demand ""Free Movie"" section that it would become an obsession.  It's a very clever combination of elements from the Biblical story of Moses, the Pinocchio fairytale, the classical Frankenstein novel and the Highlander movies.  The premise is that Hyakkimaru's father, a powerful warlord, sold 48 of his body parts to 48 demons for power over his enemies before he was even born.  A young man now, Hyakkimaru must kill each demon to retrieve his true body.  I can truly say that I've never seen a film as bizarre as this and yet with so many emotional layers.  This film upon the first viewing will leave you gaping and you'll become mesmerized by the concepts used in the movie.

The director's vision is chock full of issues surrounding abandonment, and the effect of warmongering on children, most specifically our two main characters.  In the prelude to the first battle Hyakkimaru has in the movie with a demon, several caged sad-eyed children roll by in wagon.  Later, we see the remains of an orphanage consumed by a fire that killed all the children.  At the orphanage, Dororo berates a couple who abandoned their child to the orphanage.

The two lead characters are fully formed characters, and their personalities evolve plausibly in this highly implausible movie as their relationship morphs and changes.  The interaction between the two lead characters, Hyakkimaru and Dororo is fascinating to watch.  We learn as an old storyteller tells the brash and inquisitive Dororo, who claims status as a master thief, how Hyakkimaru has ""lost heart"" after his 3rd demon kill.  Of course, as I suspect the old storyteller knew, with Dororo as his companion, his depressive state could not continue.  She simply becomes a force of nature in his life as she voices honestly to him that once he's done with the sword given him by the old story teller, especially designed to kill demons, that she will steal it from him.  There is no way she's going to let him ditch her and she is not phased at his oddly working body parts, and thing that cannot be said of certain of the villagers he's encountered in his quest, which is reminiscent of the Frankenstein story.  Her first act of theft with him is to steal one of his names, Dororo.  The two even have their own theme music to commemorate their ""bumpy"" first meeting and relationship.  Music very different from the depressive dirge we hear when we first meet Hyakkimaru, the man.  What Dororo doesn't know is that she's stolen a name that literally means, ""Little Monster,"" so her theft was actually a comforting gift, because like Pinocchio, Hyakkimaru longs to be a real human.

The secondary characters are important also, especially the shaman, Jukai, who, like Dr. Frankenstein and Geppetto, create from something new from something imperfectly formed.  Jukai adopts Hyakkimaru and the scenes show both his adoring affection and his firm hand.  It's an odd miracle that the only person on earth that could help such a pitiful, limbless creature should be this man.  An odd dichotomy in father figures in the story, as one tries to make whole what the other divided.  One is a warmonger and the other abhors war.

It is because each character has such a rich emotional life that you can ignore the CGI creatures, though I found them wildly creative.  I like the fast paces scenes as well as the slower paced ones.  I found no scene boring, not even the ones where the two main characters ""seem"" to be idly looking at flowers.  The deeper and longer you look, the more cinematic gems you'll find.  The participation of Dororo in Hyakkimaru's battles with the demons is substantial and very interesting to watch.  Both fierce and brave, she is his true and tenacious friend and while she can call him ""lunkhead"" and ""fool"", no one else better try it.  During the film she sacrifices something of extreme emotional importance to her for the sake of Hyakkimaru, which is a act of great weight, because she is quite stubborn, willful and headstrong, but it is here where the emotional layering gets even more intriguing.

It's telling that Dororo should be on the scene when Hyakkimaru recovers his voice, hearing and sight.  Before her he had no one with whom to celebrate his victories, but does rather boisterously with her.  She starts off with him much like a bossy, bratty, annoying little sister and ends up being more.  And yet this happens with no overt romantic acts, but rather in the way the two respond to one another during crises.  Of course, as I've said, I believe the old story teller arranged this circumstance, and, of course, he appears on the scene again during a major rupture between the two of them.

The reason I keep watching it over and over again is because it's one of those films where with each reviewing you see something you missed the first, fifth, twentieth time.  Check out how demon blood spatter is handled and the shaman's oddly sterile ""laboratory."" Check out the wonderful acting of the actors who play his biological parents.  Those scenes are palpable.  Because of these, though I can not condone what Hyakkimaru's father did, I completely understand his motivation.

As for how a baby could survive without a heart or other organs, it makes sense to me that for the demons to get actual ""living"" human body parts, they had to set in motion some kind of life-sustaining field around the body, else the baby would expire with each theft.  I believe this is also the reason for his other other worldly abilities.  Be sure to savor each time Hyakkimaru regains a body part, because with the same interest I had whenever the Highlander would receive power after a beheading, I also had each time Hyakkimaru regained one of his stolen body parts.  Satoshi Tsumabuki can act his behind off.

And the soundtrack -- is awesome.  It lays the foundation for the emotional resonance throughout the film, whether it's whimsical or dark.

To avoid expository dialogue, we see the two main characters' history in several flashback scenes.  Oddly, several are without the traditional introduction, but while this takes some getting used to, it does not detract from the movie.

The only problem I had was with certain of the English subtitles.  When Hyakkimaru ""senses"" danger, as he his both blind and deaf, the subtitles translate his saying what I interpret as ""I sense danger"" as ""I feel murderous.""  It took seeing it a second time to get what was really meant.  Spiderman's Peter Parker would have said his Spidey senses were tingling.  If you end up watching it as many times as I've had, you won't need the subtitles, you'll actually begin to become fluent in understanding Japanese.

Can't wait for the sequels ""Dororo 2"" and ""Dororo 3"" so as to learn more about Dororo's own intriguing past and the wall she carefully keeps up between Hyakkimaru and herself while still keeping herself close.",1250035200,14,6940,4.806913996627319
2994299,5,B000X0IKZ4,"I enjoyed Dororo immensely, it is a very entertaining film. There isn't a lot to be said about this fantasy, it works well in a number of ways. The two lead characters are very charismatic and have a great deal of fun together.

I own the Australian edition, released by Madman and it is a very fine DVD, too.

If you're after a movie that will entertain you for a couple of hours and show you some beautiful sights, then Dororo is well worth considering.",1245283200,,455,4.341176470588235
2994300,4,B000X0IKZ4,"For the record, I've never read the original ""Dororo"" manga by Osamu Tezuka, and I probably won't. Not any time soon, anyway.

But for some reason I ended up snaring a copy of the horror/fantasy story ""Dororo,"" a bizarre Japanese fantasy story about a stoic young man who wanders through an unnamed Asian land trying to regain his body parts. It's a strange, dark story with lots of macabre humour and a raucous sidekick, and director Akihiko Shiota keeps the story chugging along to the end.

Years ago a brutal warlord traded forty-eight of his unborn son's body parts to a slew of demons, in exchange for power to dominate the whole world.

The baby was sent adrift on a nearby river, and a kindly old spellcaster gave him artificial limbs and organs. Now the young man (Satoshi Tsumabuki) roams around killing the demons to regain his body parts. A young thief (Kou Shibasaki) learns his story and starts following him around, after dubbing herself by his nickname ""Dororo"" (or ""Monster Child"") and him Hyakkimaru after the sword inside his artificial left arm.

The two of them succeed in slaying several demons -- including voracious caterpillars and an armless dinosaur -- and regain a few more of Hyakkimaru's body parts. But when he kills one demon, it hints at the identity of the man who ruined Hyakkimaru's life. And he inadvertently learns that the cruel warlord who murdered Dororo's family is none other than Daddy Dearest.

""Dororo"" is one of those truly bizarre movies that you usually only find in Asian countries -- they seem a bit more secure with the macabre, bizarre, and totally unbelievable. Seriously, where else can you find a Japanese steampunk castle, a man-eating moth, and a young man whose body is mostly composed of artificial organs and limbs animated by electricity?

And director Akihiko Shiota does a good job juggling the fantasy, horror and family rama, as well as the first buds of a potential love story. And while the story gets dark and bloody in the last third -- including a gruesome duel between family members and Hyakkimaru's bleak battle with two mind-twisting demon dogs -- he's not afraid to splatter it with some rather macabre humour. Hyakkimaru barfs up various organs and reacts oddly when he has the real thing back (""SHUT UP!"") and Dororo repeatedly gets sprayed with demon gore.

While the CGI is merely adequate, the demons encountered are nicely gruesome -- carnivorous caterpillars, leather-faced harpies, and a man-eating tree are amongst them. And the movie takes takes full advantage of the windswept, grassy New Zealand terrain and the many burned temples, shady green forests and dark rivers that our heroes encounter.

And since it takes place in an unspecified Asian land -- Japanese-styled with some European armor and goblets -- Shiota has fun with the details, adding in everything from Japanese monsters to a Frankensteinian body-part-making machine.

Tsumabaki does a pretty solid job as the ""monster child"" -- glum, stoic and tormented by his freakish body, but occasionally he tumbles down in the rain laughing his head off. And while Shibasaki is initially a bit annoying as the sexually confusing urchin, she becomes a much stronger and more likable character once she gains some concern for her new friend.

""Dororo"" has a thoroughly unbelievable plot, but this is surprisingly not enough to overshadow this enjoyably bizarre horror-fantasy story. Strange, quirky and just gross enough.",1240531200,6,3463,5.017421602787456
2994301,4,B000X0IKZ4,"Let me start off by saying I have never read the original manga this movie is based on so if you are looking to see how accurate this movie is to its source material this review might not be for you.

To put it simply, if you're in the mood for a fantasy film with swords, demons, and a decent storyline look no further than Dororo.

the GOOD:
1. Storyline is entertaining.
2. the acting is solid, slightly campy but, still fun.
3. the last half of the movie (without giving away anything) is where the story really seems to come to life.

the BAD:
1. the special effects are hit and miss.  Sometimes they look great and other times they look, well, just bad.
2. some of the monster costumes look like they came straight out of a Power Rangers episode.

Since you're reading this review I assume you're interested in this title anyway so do yourself a favor and pick this one up, you won't regret it.",1233792000,9,900,4.3017751479289945
2994302,4,B000X0IKZ4,"This story of outcasts, demons, and a power-mongering warlord takes place during Japan's storied Warring States period and has been through manga and anime adaptations in the late 60's (now THAT is old school) but has just now gotten the big screen live-action treatment.  'Bout time.  Two sequels are on the way as well so lovers of Asian and fantasy cinema must rejoice!  This movie is a lot of fun to watch and although it is uneven at times -especially the special effects- it is highly recommended to fans of the genre.

""Dororo"" is the story of a child whose body was sold to demons in exchange for power before his very birth.  The monsters divided him up into 48 parts, one for each of them, and left him a featureless stump of a newborn.  Unwilling to allow her powermad husband to kill the wretched child, his mother sent him down the river in a basket, Moses-style.  He's found by a supernaturally gifted aspiring doctor who has been studying the science of regrowing limbs.  He gifts the baby with replacements for all of his missing bodyparts adn raises him as his own.  How a newborn survived that long with no heart, liver, or the like is not explained.  As a grown man, the nameless outcast hunts down the demons who stole his body.  Each time he slays one, his original body part grows back in.  Along the way, he meets a similarly nameless female thief played by super-charming pop idol Kou Shibasaki.  The uncultured and obnoxious girl happens upon the hero slaying a demon in a bar and decides to follow him, hoping to take his blade -which was forged for vengeance- for her own quest.  She takes a liking to the name ""Dororo"" (little monster) and takes it as her own and the two are all set for adventure.

The hero -who takes the name Hyakkimaru- is your typical stoic Japanese protagonist and Dororo is the typical&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kikuchiyo/dp/B000G8NXYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kikuchiyo</a>&nbsp;character: foolish and annoying, but gutsy and with a big heart.  Hyakkimaru's aforementioned sword is particularly cool because it is embedded in his his elbow with his phony forearm acting like a pseudo-flesh sheath.  Very, very cool.  The fights are plentiful and a lot of fun and the variety of demons is wonderful, ranging from a blade-wielding gargoyle to a ridiculously awesome crabwoman to a monstrous tree that will likely drop your jaw.  The journey is an absolute joy until the plot starts to thicken.  Yup, old family reckonings must be reckoned.  The result is a slowdown on the action and a dramatically ill-thought-out finale that isn't bad, but definitely knocks the film down a notch.  Any more would be spoilers.

The special effects are very inconsistent.  The first demon was a marvel to behold and I had assumed that this was the going to be the best fantasy film ever after it showed up.  On the other end, there's a giant suitmation lizard that would still have looked cheap and out-of-place if he was battling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/B000VXWK86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;in the 60's, CG tongue or no.  There are more winners than losers, but the inconsistency is annoying.

""Dororo"" is full of cool characters, bada$z beasties, and killer concepts so if you enjoy the occasional fantasy film then proceed full steam ahead; this one's a winner.  I'm hotly anticipating the sequels and wondering if another anime might be forthcoming.  That would be sweet.  Here's to American audiences getting a clue and demanding that quality films be imported from overseas for the theatrical runs they richly deserve.  We've got next to nothing going on over here.",1222560000,21,3739,5.150912106135987

2994304,4,B000X0IKZ4,"DORORO is another manga-based (Japanese comic book) film from the proclaimed ""King of Manga""; Osamu Tezuka (Astroboy). I haven't read the comic so all I can do is comment on how well the film is made and its entertainment value. ""Dororo"" is a bizarre blend of Fantasy-horror, Jidai Geki-samurai swordplay and sub-par CGI effects. Director Koichi Chigira seems to have a rather uneven execution, the film may sometimes feel very macabre then it becomes a little silly. Just to toss out a warning, the film may not be for everyone and may require an acquired taste.

Plot synopsis loosely derived from the region-3 dvd back cover:
Period Dynastic year 3048.
A vast territory stretching to the far East lies scorched, mired in decades of civil warfare. The warlord Kagemitsu Daigo (Kiichi Nakai), is weary of the war between the clans and determined to end the anarchy and unify the land. In need of power, he turns to the demon underworld for aid. A deal is made but the price is a son, born to him without eyes, ears, mouth or any limbs, all of which are parceled out to 48 different demons that inhabit the land. Kagemitsu orders this abomination destroyed. But his wife, Yuri (Meiko Harada) decides to spare the infant, sending him down the river in a basket, subject to the hand of fate.

Story of Moses, not quite; the film's premise is actually very interesting. The infant is actually missing 48 body parts, saved by a mystical inventor called Jukai (Yoshio Harada), he grows up to be become a teenager named Hyakkiman (Satoshi Tsumabuki). Endowed with special prosthetics, including arms with samurai swords, one of which is a mystical blade that is forged to kill demons. Hyakkiman begins his travels to locate the demons that have his missing body parts, with each one he slays, he recovers a part of himself and ejects the synthetic part. He doesn't have a heart so impaling him through the chest is useless. The setback to all of this is that when he recovers his natural body parts, he also slowly becomes more vulnerable. His prosthetics is made from already dead infants, a bit macabre, don't you think?

Along his travels, he encounters a tomboyish girl (Kou Shibasaki, Battle Royale) who he begins to call ""Dororo"". I know, I wondered myself how come the film's title is after his sidekick; not to worry, it'll be explained in the film. The orphaned girl decides to tag along in his travels and aid him in recovering his body parts. Their meeting seemed too convenient at first, but thankfully, the plot manages to tie them together along with the links between all the major characters. Also, what I really found interesting is the ironic fact that the demons feared that Kagemitsu's son may become their downfall and because of the deal with Hyakkiman's father, the price they asked may have sealed their fates?

While the film's premise is original enough and it did arouse my curiosity, unfortunately, ""Dororo"" is a mixed bag. I suppose, perhaps if I've read the Japanese comic I may say that it was faithful to its roots. However, the film's execution is a little flawed. Director Koichi Chigira sometimes lead the proceedings to an overlong pace and to help it out, he tries to incorporate the occasional unintentional laugh. These ""fillers"" seem a little out of place in my opinion, the occasional cheesiness present in the film makes its tone a little uneven to be taken seriously. The film's saving grace may well be served with Hyakkiman's emotional encounter with his father and mother and of course the occasional blood and some gore.

The action sequences by Chinese veteran Ching Siu Tang is exaggerated and ""manga-inspired"". Hyakkiman's encounters with different CGI demons stumbles at times, it was obvious that some of them were men in rubber suits. (Shades of Ultra-Man?) This results in the action sequences becoming a bit cheesy, and with the film's themes of the macabre, it becomes a bit inconsistent with its other elements. Jokai's workshop is filled with the body parts of already dead children and the very idea that Hyakkiman's prosthetics are made from dead kids should feel very creepy; coupled with the fact that these demonic opponents supposedly feeds on infants, ""Dororo"" should be a lot more horrific than campy. With all these elements in play, maybe this film was originally intended to be an anime series than a live-action film. Still, the energetic acrobatic fights can be entertaining, while the set designs and costumes look appropriate for this type of film.

The film is a fun watch as long as one remembers what he is watching, while ignoring the occasional dull moments. The viewer also needs to consider the film's source material. Also, Hyakkiman doesn't recover all 48 body parts, so there is a strong chance for Dororo 2 and 3. I felt a certain curiosity whenever Hyakkiman kills a demon and I wonder which body part would grow back. I really liked the film's premise about a young warrior looking to recover his lost body parts that a sequel or two would definitely make sense. It'll be fun when Hyakkiman recovers his brain or something else-- you know what I'm thinking?

There is decent emotion to be had with Hyakkiman's encounter with his father and mother.

Chinese veteran Ching Siu Tang choreographs the action sequences. Hyakkiman's encounters with different CGI-spawned demons stumbles at times, it was somewhat obvious that some of them are men in rubber suits. This results in the action sequences becoming a bit cheesy, and with the screenplay's dalliance to the macabre, it becomes a tad silly. Jukai's workshop is filled with the body parts of already dead children in the battlefield and the very idea that Hyakkiman's prosthetics are made from dead kids is very creepy. Dororo is a bit horrific at the same time comical and even dramatic, I think it probably will work much better as an anime than a live-action film. The occasional cheesiness present in the film often makes it look like a kid-flick, but not a chance with the omnipresent blood and gore, so the film feels rather uneven.

Still, the acrobatic fights somewhat fit this fantasy film and the set designs are very decent. The film is a fun watch as long as one remembers what he is watching and considers the film's source material. Also, Hyakkiman doesn't recover all 48 body parts, so there is a strong chance for Dororo 2 and 3.

I have the region-3 release from CV Media/Golden Scene. There is an official all-region Thai dvd floating around but the English Subs on the Thailand version are timed poorly. My friend has this copy.
VIDEO/AUDIO: 1.78 ratio Anamorphic widescreen. The picture is nice but the opening scene was intentionally shot to look grainy and dirty to emphasize the ""look"" of the past. Other than this, the picture quality is very clean, sharp and crisp. Colors are natural with good black levels. The CGI scenes have that softer side though. 6.1 Dolby Digital EX/6.1 DTS-ES in Japanese. Clear and strong sound with excellent subtitles.

In Closing:
Despite the occasional dull moments and the cheesy CGI at times, ""Dororo"" is a fun watch. I felt a certain curiosity whenever Hyakkiman kills a demon and I wonder which body part grows back. I like the film's premise about a young warrior looking to recover his lost body parts that a sequel or two may not be a bad idea. It'll be fun when Hyakkiman recovers his brain or something else.(Y'know what I'm thinking)

2994372,5,B000X0IKZ4,"This is a great Asian Fantasy tale full of creatures, demons, and fighting - it is very Frankenstein in the resurrection and growth of the main hero, as well as a tale of vengeance - this is the first time that I have seen where a character is on a quest so bring his body whole again, and while he is enchanted and heals quickly, the more of his true form he gets the less he can heal. such a great turn of irony in that the better you do in your quest, the more vulnerable you become.

I have but 3 complaints, but as you see, they do not make the movie any less a 5 star film.

1 - the subtitles are small, on the left hand side, and in the middle of the screen - makes for difficult reading of the English translations

2 - even though the subtitles are small, they are in such a pale white, that the background sometimes ruins your ability to read the words.

the story and concept is high marks, I only wish that they had a bit more in the budget for some of the creatures - the important ones were well done, but others that had less screen time also had less development, and the film suffered a bit due to that

all in all, this is a great tale of adventure and revenge and a shining example of how some Asian cinema can outdo current American films.",1403481600,,1259,4.040160642570281

2994387,5,B000X0IKZ4,"Dororo offers beautiful cinematography which will seize and enthrall you, plot/concept/dialogue you either get right away or soon in a Eureka! flash, the plot almost like a Shakespearean tragedy and farce all roiled together. No spoilers here; Dororo's magic doesn't need surprises. It's all surprises

 It's a great see and re-see a movie which will surprise you time after time. It could be seen as a whole new genre in filmmaking. Actually, it got better every time I viewed it. You will be affected; maybe it will stun you or maybe Enlighten you. For sure it will enterain you. It is an absolutely unique experience. For action lovers, there's plenty to rock any action junkie. Swords splatter blood, body parts sail every which way; you'll have trouble sitting still. Same getting-rocked problem hits for aficionados of hot dance routines with all-out dancing with suprising Asians doing exotic Bollywood verve (with their trademark energy) Then flow into Spanish/Mexican rhythms done like you've never heard before.

 Surprise: Dororo takes place in 3064. This is a very unusual mystical SciFi concept with a feudal twist in an apocalyptic time. Great special effects keep hitting you for the film's 139 minutes of action and intrigue with great production values throughout.

One last note: There are several DVD versions of Dororo. Reading reviews I chose a yellow-green cover with the subtitle ""The Quest of a Samurai Warrior (actually a misleading subhead this Dororo is much more complex and original). Other reviewers have noted problems on other versions I avoided. Check out their complaints; I hope you stick with the yellow-green cover version.

2994437,4,B000X0IKZ4,"This is one wild movie. It's a sprawling sci-fi, fantasy epic set in 3085 Japan that looks more like it's set in feudal Japan. No spaceships or crazy weapons. Just swords, knives, samurai armor and the like. But it's loaded with magic and demons, great sword play and stunts and a way cool story.

Here's the scoop. Dad wants to conquer the world, so he promises 48 demons his unborn son to achieve this. Son is born with a head and body. No feet, legs, hands or arms. Dad's going to kill the son and send him to the demons. Mom won't let him and sends the son adrift in a reed basket a' la Moses. A man finds the boy and builds him a flesh and blood (sort of) body which is self healing and the hands can be removed to reveal swords. Son now is on a quest to kill the 48 demons. Every one he kills will restore a body part that was previously missing. He hooks up with a feisty female thief (Dororo of the title) and the two are off on the great adventure.

This is one of the wildest, weirdest movies I've ever seen. The set-up itself is unique and the adventures are equally weird. You meet all manner of demons and situations that the hero and thief must deal with. And it's all wonderful. There are great characters here and the story plays out well. The costumes and sets are good. The fight scenes are generally choreographed and directed well. The effects are a hoot. Some are decent enough CGI while some are man in a rubber suit fun like the old Godzilla movies. There's a playfulness to all of it but without letting the impact of the story diminish.

This film also has a good look to it. The sets and costuming are very good. The music is eclectic. Some is Asian, some is Mexican, some is American mountain sounding and it ends with a heavy rock tune. The directing is generally good with a lot of clever, nifty touches. There's a great use of the landscape as well as some nicely designed interiors. What really propels this though are the two leads. It's his story, but her name is the the title and she becomes more important as the film progresses. And at 2 hours and 18 minutes it's a long (but by no means slow) progress.

This is a truly good/great movie. There are a ton of things going on and it moves like a freight train. There is always something happening with bouts of humor to keep things from getting too serious. The two leads do a great job and I found myself falling for Dororo by the end of the film. She's a real hoot and she has an arresting face. This might not be for everyone but for those who are anywhere near disposed to this sort of thing it's a great ride.",1299456000,,2599,4.233870967741935

2994441,4,B000X0IKZ4,"A warlord on the brink of defeat pledges the life of his son to 48 demons, in exchange for the power to subdue his enemies.  The scavenged boy, now a bare soul in a lump of flesh, is saved by a shaman, who constructs body parts for him from the bodies of young children destroyed in battle, and commits him to avenge their souls by struggling against war.  He must also win back his body parts from the 48 demons who have taken them in order to become flesh and wreak havoc.  Along the way he meets a nameless thief, a young woman who was also abandoned at childhood, when the warlord killed her parents.  What follows is an unusual love story and revenge tale that turns into a quest for redemption, with a bunch of fun swordplay with inventive, if also a bit silly, Yokai-style demons.  The bloody explosions that ensued when a demon was destroyed, combined with the sometimes hokey but always unusual costumes of the demons, reminded me a bit of old school horror like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Evil-Dead/dp/B00005R24K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Evil Dead</a>, but with a major Japanese twist, and a bit of CGI thrown in there for some of the more unusual effects.

2994443,4,B000X0IKZ4,"From defeat in a bloody battle, his armor riddled with arrows, Lord Daigo enters a temple that houses the 48 carved statues of demons. There, despite a priest's warning, he makes a pact, seeking power over his enemies at first, then reaching for power over the world. In exchange, he agrees to the  demons' desire--the body of his soon to be born child. Daigo's forehead is marked to seal the dread pact.

Move forward some years, and a palm reader reads a hooded man's hand and asks: ""Didn't you die a long time ago?"" The hooded stranger, revealed to be a handsome fighter of skill and some highly unusual limb-related abilities,  engages in battle with a masked demon. When he wins, we see his prosthetic lower leg be replaced with a real one that magically grows in.

A female-dressed-as-male thief sees this astonishing regeneration and seeks information on the stranger from a traveling minstrel--be he man or monster. The minstrel relates the tale, of which he was part witness and which feels very much fairy tale meets Moses tale meets Frankenstein, of how a baby with missing body parts is reescued and ""completed"" by a healer's exceptional skills. This part of the film has a lovely folkloric quality about it, and the visuals are partly grotesque, partly moving, aided by the semi-lullaby sound of the soundtrack. The healer's cottage verges on the steampunky.

And so we enter the quest of the grown man--who is sometimes called Hyakkimaru, the name on the blade in his left arm-- to obtain once more the parts of his body that were sacrificed in infancy and his vengeance-driven thief sidekick--who dubs herself Dororo, a name that could equally apply to the strange man of removable limbs as the meaning of ""dororo"" is little monster. Like most good fantasy/fairy tales, we have a special weapon forged to kill magical creatures (goblins, demons), a mentor in the Shaman who gives Hyakkimaru his regenerated body, and allies and antagonists along the way, not all demonic. The horrors of war and warlord tyranny runs through the whole of the film.

Some of the demons are cool (the spidery one, the moth one), some not so much (the heinously awful reptile one should have been edited out, honestly); the composite child spirits was awkward). But by the time the climactic showdown comes, and we see the weird family dynamic at work between Hyakkumaru and his kin, we end up feeling sorry for a host of folks, because the father's initial act of child sacrifice has some ugly repercussions. Will reunion bring vengeance, redemption, good, bad?

I will note that this is not a complete story--by film's end, Hyakkimaru has obtained only half of his demon-confiscated body parts. But the tale still has a satisfactory conclusion, with character growth and tragedy and a bit of redemption.

I enjoyed it visually (mostly) and storywise (mostly). And the actor who plays Hyakkimaru is a hottie. (Bonus!) The English subtitles didn't seem odd (like in some subbed films I've seen from Asia), and the actors did a very good job.

Wow...so much better than I had ever thought possible. The special effects are good for the most part with pretty good characters throughout the story. The movie keeps you watching with anticipation of what will happen next. On a personal note, I was kind of dissapointed with how the movie ended but even then, I gave the movie 5 stars.

3228795,5,B000X0IKZ4,"I had no idea when I selected ""Dororo"" from the Comcast-on-Demand ""Free Movie"" section that it would become an obsession.  It's a very clever combination of elements from the Biblical story of Moses, the Pinocchio fairytale, the classical Frankenstein novel and the Highlander movies.  The premise is that Hyakkimaru's father, a powerful warlord, sold 48 of his body parts to 48 demons for power over his enemies before he was even born.  A young man now, Hyakkimaru must kill each demon to retrieve his true body.  I can truly say that I've never seen a film as bizarre as this and yet with so many emotional layers.  This film upon the first viewing will leave you gaping and you'll become mesmerized by the concepts used in the movie.

The director's vision is chock full of issues surrounding abandonment, and the effect of warmongering on children, most specifically our two main characters.  In the prelude to the first battle Hyakkimaru has in the movie with a demon, several caged sad-eyed children roll by in wagon.  Later, we see the remains of an orphanage consumed by a fire that killed all the children.  At the orphanage, Dororo berates a couple who abandoned their child to the orphanage.

The two lead characters are fully formed characters, and their personalities evolve plausibly in this highly implausible movie as their relationship morphs and changes.  The interaction between the two lead characters, Hyakkimaru and Dororo is fascinating to watch.  We learn as an old storyteller tells the brash and inquisitive Dororo, who claims status as a master thief, how Hyakkimaru has ""lost heart"" after his 3rd demon kill.  Of course, as I suspect the old storyteller knew, with Dororo as his companion, his depressive state could not continue.  She simply becomes a force of nature in his life as she voices honestly to him that once he's done with the sword given him by the old story teller, especially designed to kill demons, that she will steal it from him.  There is no way she's going to let him ditch her and she is not phased at his oddly working body parts, and thing that cannot be said of certain of the villagers he's encountered in his quest, which is reminiscent of the Frankenstein story.  Her first act of theft with him is to steal one of his names, Dororo.  The two even have their own theme music to commemorate their ""bumpy"" first meeting and relationship.  Music very different from the depressive dirge we hear when we first meet Hyakkimaru, the man.  What Dororo doesn't know is that she's stolen a name that literally means, ""Little Monster,"" so her theft was actually a comforting gift, because like Pinocchio, Hyakkimaru longs to be a real human.

The secondary characters are important also, especially the shaman, Jukai, who, like Dr. Frankenstein and Geppetto, create from something new from something imperfectly formed.  Jukai adopts Hyakkimaru and the scenes show both his adoring affection and his firm hand.  It's an odd miracle that the only person on earth that could help such a pitiful, limbless creature should be this man.  An odd dichotomy in father figures in the story, as one tries to make whole what the other divided.  One is a warmonger and the other abhors war.

It is because each character has such a rich emotional life that you can ignore the CGI creatures, though I found them wildly creative.  I like the fast paces scenes as well as the slower paced ones.  I found no scene boring, not even the ones where the two main characters ""seem"" to be idly looking at flowers.  The deeper and longer you look, the more cinematic gems you'll find.  The participation of Dororo in Hyakkimaru's battles with the demons is substantial and very interesting to watch.  Both fierce and brave, she is his true and tenacious friend and while she can call him ""lunkhead"" and ""fool"", no one else better try it.  During the film she sacrifices something of extreme emotional importance to her for the sake of Hyakkimaru, which is a act of great weight, because she is quite stubborn, willful and headstrong, but it is here where the emotional layering gets even more intriguing.

It's telling that Dororo should be on the scene when Hyakkimaru recovers his voice, hearing and sight.  Before her he had no one with whom to celebrate his victories, but does rather boisterously with her.  She starts off with him much like a bossy, bratty, annoying little sister and ends up being more.  And yet this happens with no overt romantic acts, but rather in the way the two respond to one another during crises.  Of course, as I've said, I believe the old story teller arranged this circumstance, and, of course, he appears on the scene again during a major rupture between the two of them.

The reason I keep watching it over and over again is because it's one of those films where with each reviewing you see something you missed the first, fifth, twentieth time.  Check out how demon blood spatter is handled and the shaman's oddly sterile ""laboratory."" Check out the wonderful acting of the actors who play his biological parents.  Those scenes are palpable.  Because of these, though I can not condone what Hyakkimaru's father did, I completely understand his motivation.

As for how a baby could survive without a heart or other organs, it makes sense to me that for the demons to get actual ""living"" human body parts, they had to set in motion some kind of life-sustaining field around the body, else the baby would expire with each theft.  I believe this is also the reason for his other other worldly abilities.  Be sure to savor each time Hyakkimaru regains a body part, because with the same interest I had whenever the Highlander would receive power after a beheading, I also had each time Hyakkimaru regained one of his stolen body parts.  Satoshi Tsumabuki can act his behind off.

And the soundtrack -- is awesome.  It lays the foundation for the emotional resonance throughout the film, whether it's whimsical or dark.

To avoid expository dialogue, we see the two main characters' history in several flashback scenes.  Oddly, several are without the traditional introduction, but while this takes some getting used to, it does not detract from the movie.

The only problem I had was with certain of the English subtitles.  When Hyakkimaru ""senses"" danger, as he his both blind and deaf, the subtitles translate his saying what I interpret as ""I sense danger"" as ""I feel murderous.""  It took seeing it a second time to get what was really meant.  Spiderman's Peter Parker would have said his Spidey senses were tingling.  If you end up watching it as many times as I've had, you won't need the subtitles, you'll actually begin to become fluent in understanding Japanese.

Can't wait for the sequels ""Dororo 2"" and ""Dororo 3"" so as to learn more about Dororo's own intriguing past and the wall she carefully keeps up between Hyakkimaru and herself while still keeping herself close.",1250035200,14,6940,4.806913996627319

3228797,4,B000X0IKZ4,"For the record, I've never read the original ""Dororo"" manga by Osamu Tezuka, and I probably won't. Not any time soon, anyway.

But for some reason I ended up snaring a copy of the horror/fantasy story ""Dororo,"" a bizarre Japanese fantasy story about a stoic young man who wanders through an unnamed Asian land trying to regain his body parts. It's a strange, dark story with lots of macabre humour and a raucous sidekick, and director Akihiko Shiota keeps the story chugging along to the end.

Years ago a brutal warlord traded forty-eight of his unborn son's body parts to a slew of demons, in exchange for power to dominate the whole world.

The baby was sent adrift on a nearby river, and a kindly old spellcaster gave him artificial limbs and organs. Now the young man (Satoshi Tsumabuki) roams around killing the demons to regain his body parts. A young thief (Kou Shibasaki) learns his story and starts following him around, after dubbing herself by his nickname ""Dororo"" (or ""Monster Child"") and him Hyakkimaru after the sword inside his artificial left arm.

The two of them succeed in slaying several demons -- including voracious caterpillars and an armless dinosaur -- and regain a few more of Hyakkimaru's body parts. But when he kills one demon, it hints at the identity of the man who ruined Hyakkimaru's life. And he inadvertently learns that the cruel warlord who murdered Dororo's family is none other than Daddy Dearest.

""Dororo"" is one of those truly bizarre movies that you usually only find in Asian countries -- they seem a bit more secure with the macabre, bizarre, and totally unbelievable. Seriously, where else can you find a Japanese steampunk castle, a man-eating moth, and a young man whose body is mostly composed of artificial organs and limbs animated by electricity?

And director Akihiko Shiota does a good job juggling the fantasy, horror and family rama, as well as the first buds of a potential love story. And while the story gets dark and bloody in the last third -- including a gruesome duel between family members and Hyakkimaru's bleak battle with two mind-twisting demon dogs -- he's not afraid to splatter it with some rather macabre humour. Hyakkimaru barfs up various organs and reacts oddly when he has the real thing back (""SHUT UP!"") and Dororo repeatedly gets sprayed with demon gore.

While the CGI is merely adequate, the demons encountered are nicely gruesome -- carnivorous caterpillars, leather-faced harpies, and a man-eating tree are amongst them. And the movie takes takes full advantage of the windswept, grassy New Zealand terrain and the many burned temples, shady green forests and dark rivers that our heroes encounter.

And since it takes place in an unspecified Asian land -- Japanese-styled with some European armor and goblets -- Shiota has fun with the details, adding in everything from Japanese monsters to a Frankensteinian body-part-making machine.

Tsumabaki does a pretty solid job as the ""monster child"" -- glum, stoic and tormented by his freakish body, but occasionally he tumbles down in the rain laughing his head off. And while Shibasaki is initially a bit annoying as the sexually confusing urchin, she becomes a much stronger and more likable character once she gains some concern for her new friend.

""Dororo"" has a thoroughly unbelievable plot, but this is surprisingly not enough to overshadow this enjoyably bizarre horror-fantasy story. Strange, quirky and just gross enough.",1240531200,6,3463,5.017421602787456

'Bout time.  Two sequels are on the way as well so lovers of Asian and fantasy cinema must rejoice!  This movie is a lot of fun to watch and although it is uneven at times -especially the special effects- it is highly recommended to fans of the genre.

""Dororo"" is the story of a child whose body was sold to demons in exchange for power before his very birth.  The monsters divided him up into 48 parts, one for each of them, and left him a featureless stump of a newborn.  Unwilling to allow her powermad husband to kill the wretched child, his mother sent him down the river in a basket, Moses-style.  He's found by a supernaturally gifted aspiring doctor who has been studying the science of regrowing limbs.  He gifts the baby with replacements for all of his missing bodyparts adn raises him as his own.  How a newborn survived that long with no heart, liver, or the like is not explained.  As a grown man, the nameless outcast hunts down the demons who stole his body.  Each time he slays one, his original body part grows back in.  Along the way, he meets a similarly nameless female thief played by super-charming pop idol Kou Shibasaki.  The uncultured and obnoxious girl happens upon the hero slaying a demon in a bar and decides to follow him, hoping to take his blade -which was forged for vengeance- for her own quest.  She takes a liking to the name ""Dororo"" (little monster) and takes it as her own and the two are all set for adventure.

The hero -who takes the name Hyakkimaru- is your typical stoic Japanese protagonist and Dororo is the typical&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kikuchiyo/dp/B000G8NXYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kikuchiyo</a>&nbsp;character: foolish and annoying, but gutsy and with a big heart.  Hyakkimaru's aforementioned sword is particularly cool because it is embedded in his his elbow with his phony forearm acting like a pseudo-flesh sheath.  Very, very cool.  The fights are plentiful and a lot of fun and the variety of demons is wonderful, ranging from a blade-wielding gargoyle to a ridiculously awesome crabwoman to a monstrous tree that will likely drop your jaw.  The journey is an absolute joy until the plot starts to thicken.  Yup, old family reckonings must be reckoned.  The result is a slowdown on the action and a dramatically ill-thought-out finale that isn't bad, but definitely knocks the film down a notch.  Any more would be spoilers.

The special effects are very inconsistent.  The first demon was a marvel to behold and I had assumed that this was the going to be the best fantasy film ever after it showed up.  On the other end, there's a giant suitmation lizard that would still have looked cheap and out-of-place if he was battling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/B000VXWK86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;in the 60's, CG tongue or no.  There are more winners than losers, but the inconsistency is annoying.

""Dororo"" is full of cool characters, bada$z beasties, and killer concepts so if you enjoy the occasional fantasy film then proceed full steam ahead; this one's a winner.  I'm hotly anticipating the sequels and wondering if another anime might be forthcoming.  That would be sweet.  Here's to American audiences getting a clue and demanding that quality films be imported from overseas for the theatrical runs they richly deserve.  We've got next to nothing going on over here.",1222560000,21,3739,5.150912106135987
3228800,4,B000X0IKZ4,"For the record, I've never read the original ""Dororo"" manga by Osamu Tezuka, and I probably won't. Not any time soon, anyway.

But for some reason I ended up snaring a copy of the horror/fantasy story ""Dororo,"" a bizarre Japanese fantasy story about a stoic young man who wanders through an unnamed Asian land trying to regain his body parts. It's a strange, dark story with lots of macabre humour and a raucous sidekick, and director Akihiko Shiota keeps the story chugging along to the end.

Years ago a brutal warlord traded forty-eight of his unborn son's body parts to a slew of demons, in exchange for power to dominate the whole world.

The baby was sent adrift on a nearby river, and a kindly old spellcaster gave him artificial limbs and organs. Now the young man (Satoshi Tsumabuki) roams around killing the demons to regain his body parts. A young thief (Kou Shibasaki) learns his story and starts following him around, after dubbing herself by his nickname ""Dororo"" (or ""Monster Child"") and him Hyakkimaru after the sword inside his artificial left arm.

The two of them succeed in slaying several demons -- including voracious caterpillars and an armless dinosaur --  and regain a few more of Hyakkimaru's body parts. But when he kills one demon, it hints at the identity of the man who ruined Hyakkimaru's life. And he inadvertently learns that the cruel warlord who murdered Dororo's family is none other than Daddy Dearest.

""Dororo"" is one of those truly bizarre movies that you usually only find in Asian countries -- they seem a bit more secure with the macabre, bizarre, and totally unbelievable. Seriously, where else can you find a Japanese steampunk castle, a man-eating moth, and a young man whose body is mostly composed of artificial organs and limbs animated by electricity?

And director Akihiko Shiota does a good job juggling the fantasy, horror and family rama, as well as the first buds of a potential love story. And while the story gets dark and bloody in the last third -- including a gruesome duel between family members and Hyakkimaru's bleak battle with two mind-twisting demon dogs -- he's not afraid to splatter it with some rather macabre humour. Hyakkimaru barfs up various organs and reacts oddly when he has the real thing back (""SHUT UP!"") and Dororo repeatedly gets sprayed with demon gore.

While the CGI is merely adequate, the demons encountered are nicely gruesome -- carnivorous caterpillars, leather-faced harpies, and a man-eating tree are amongst them. And the movie takes takes full advantage of the windswept, grassy New Zealand terrain and the many burned temples, shady green forests and dark rivers that our heroes encounter.

And since it takes place in an unspecified Asian land -- Japanese-styled with some European armor and goblets -- Shiota has fun with the details, adding in everything from Japanese monsters to a Frankensteinian body-part-making machine.

Tsumabaki does a pretty solid job as the ""monster child"" -- glum, stoic and tormented by his freakish body, but occasionally he tumbles down in the rain laughing his head off. And while Shibasaki is initially a bit annoying as the sexually confusing urchin, she becomes a much stronger and more likable character once she gains some concern for her new friend.

""Dororo"" has a thoroughly unbelievable plot, but this is surprisingly not enough to overshadow this enjoyably bizarre horror-fantasy story. Strange, quirky and just gross enough.",1221523200,,3464,5.017421602787456
3228801,4,B000X0IKZ4,"DORORO is another manga-based (Japanese comic book) film from the proclaimed ""King of Manga""; Osamu Tezuka (Astroboy). I haven't read the comic so all I can do is comment on how well the film is made and its entertainment value. ""Dororo"" is a bizarre blend of Fantasy-horror, Jidai Geki-samurai swordplay and sub-par CGI effects. Director Koichi Chigira seems to have a rather uneven execution, the film may sometimes feel very macabre then it becomes a little silly. Just to toss out a warning, the film may not be for everyone and may require an acquired taste.

Plot synopsis loosely derived from the region-3 dvd back cover:
Period Dynastic year 3048.
A vast territory stretching to the far East lies scorched, mired in decades of civil warfare. The warlord Kagemitsu Daigo (Kiichi Nakai), is weary of the war between the clans and determined to end the anarchy and unify the land. In need of power, he turns to the demon underworld for aid. A deal is made but the price is a son, born to him without eyes, ears, mouth or any limbs, all of which are parceled out to 48 different demons that inhabit the land. Kagemitsu orders this abomination destroyed. But his wife, Yuri (Meiko Harada) decides to spare the infant, sending him down the river in a basket, subject to the hand of fate.

Story of Moses, not quite; the film's premise is actually very interesting. The infant is actually missing 48 body parts, saved by a mystical inventor called Jukai (Yoshio Harada), he grows up to be become a teenager named Hyakkiman (Satoshi Tsumabuki). Endowed with special prosthetics, including arms with samurai swords, one of which is a mystical blade that is forged to kill demons. Hyakkiman begins his travels to locate the demons that have his missing body parts, with each one he slays, he recovers a part of himself and ejects the synthetic part. He doesn't have a heart so impaling him through the chest is useless. The setback to all of this is that when he recovers his natural body parts, he also slowly becomes more vulnerable. His prosthetics is made from already dead infants, a bit macabre, don't you think?

Along his travels, he encounters a tomboyish girl (Kou Shibasaki, Battle Royale) who he begins to call ""Dororo"". I know, I wondered myself how come the film's title is after his sidekick; not to worry, it'll be explained in the film. The orphaned girl decides to tag along in his travels and aid him in recovering his body parts. Their meeting seemed too convenient at first, but thankfully, the plot manages to tie them together along with the links between all the major characters. Also, what I really found interesting is the ironic fact that the demons feared that Kagemitsu's son may become their downfall and because of the deal with Hyakkiman's father, the price they asked may have sealed their fates?

While the film's premise is original enough and it did arouse my curiosity, unfortunately, ""Dororo"" is a mixed bag. I suppose, perhaps if I've read the Japanese comic I may say that it was faithful to its roots. However, the film's execution is a little flawed. Director Koichi Chigira sometimes lead the proceedings to an overlong pace and to help it out, he tries to incorporate the occasional unintentional laugh. These ""fillers"" seem a little out of place in my opinion, the occasional cheesiness present in the film makes its tone a little uneven to be taken seriously. The film's saving grace may well be served with Hyakkiman's emotional encounter with his father and mother and of course the occasional blood and some gore.

The action sequences by Chinese veteran Ching Siu Tang is exaggerated and ""manga-inspired"". Hyakkiman's encounters with different CGI demons stumbles at times, it was obvious that some of them were men in rubber suits. (Shades of Ultra-Man?) This results in the action sequences becoming a bit cheesy, and with the film's themes of the macabre, it becomes a bit inconsistent with its other elements. Jokai's workshop is filled with the body parts of already dead children and the very idea that Hyakkiman's prosthetics are made from dead kids should feel very creepy; coupled with the fact that these demonic opponents supposedly feeds on infants, ""Dororo"" should be a lot more horrific than campy. With all these elements in play, maybe this film was originally intended to be an anime series than a live-action film. Still, the energetic acrobatic fights can be entertaining, while the set designs and costumes look appropriate for this type of film.

The film is a fun watch as long as one remembers what he is watching, while ignoring the occasional dull moments. The viewer also needs to consider the film's source material. Also, Hyakkiman doesn't recover all 48 body parts, so there is a strong chance for Dororo 2 and 3. I felt a certain curiosity whenever Hyakkiman kills a demon and I wonder which body part would grow back. I really liked the film's premise about a young warrior looking to recover his lost body parts that a sequel or two would definitely make sense. It'll be fun when Hyakkiman recovers his brain or something else-- you know what I'm thinking?

Recommended Timidly to fans of J-cinema and a good rental for everybody else. The film requires an ""acquired taste"". [3  Stars]",1219276800,,5266,4.843333333333334

However, the film's execution is flawed. Director Koichi Chigira sometimes lead the proceedings to long boring moments and the occasional unintentional laugh. There is decent emotion to be had with Hyakkiman's encounter with his father and mother.

Chinese veteran Ching Siu Tang choreographs the action sequences. Hyakkiman's encounters with different CGI-spawned demons stumbles at times, it was somewhat obvious that some of them are men in rubber suits. This results in the action sequences becoming a bit cheesy, and with the screenplay's dalliance to the macabre, it becomes a tad silly. Jukai's workshop is filled with the body parts of already dead children in the battlefield and the very idea that Hyakkiman's prosthetics are made from dead kids is very creepy. Dororo is a bit horrific at the same time comical and even dramatic, I think it probably will work much better as an anime than a live-action film. The occasional cheesiness present in the film often makes it look like a kid-flick, but not a chance with the omnipresent blood and gore, so the film feels rather uneven.

Still, the acrobatic fights somewhat fit this fantasy film and the set designs are very decent. The film is a fun watch as long as one remembers what he is watching and considers the film's source material. Also, Hyakkiman doesn't recover all 48 body parts, so there is a strong chance for Dororo 2 and 3.

I have the region-3 release from CV Media/Golden Scene. There is an official all-region Thai dvd floating around but the English Subs on the Thailand version are timed poorly. My friend has this copy.
VIDEO/AUDIO: 1.78 ratio Anamorphic widescreen. The picture is nice but the opening scene was intentionally shot to look grainy and dirty to emphasize the ""look"" of the past. Other than this, the picture quality is very clean, sharp and crisp. Colors are natural with good black levels. The CGI scenes have that softer side though. 6.1 Dolby Digital EX/6.1 DTS-ES in Japanese. Clear and strong sound with excellent subtitles.

In Closing:
Despite the occasional dull moments and the cheesy CGI at times, ""Dororo"" is a fun watch. I felt a certain curiosity whenever Hyakkiman kills a demon and I wonder which body part grows back. I like the film's premise about a young warrior looking to recover his lost body parts that a sequel or two may not be a bad idea. It'll be fun when Hyakkiman recovers his brain or something else.(Y'know what I'm thinking)

I have but 3 complaints, but as you see, they do not make the movie any less a 5 star film.

1 - the subtitles are small, on the left hand side, and in the middle of the screen - makes for difficult reading of the English translations

2 - even though the subtitles are small, they are in such a pale white, that the background sometimes ruins your ability to read the words.

the story and concept is high marks, I only wish that they had a bit more in the budget for some of the creatures - the important ones were well done, but others that had less screen time also had less development, and the film suffered a bit due to that

all in all, this is a great tale of adventure and revenge and a shining example of how some Asian cinema can outdo current American films.",1403481600,,1259,4.040160642570281

No spoilers here; Dororo's magic doesn't need surprises. It's all surprises

 It's a great see and re-see a movie which will surprise you time after time. It could be seen as a whole new genre in filmmaking. Actually, it got better every time I viewed it. You will be affected; maybe it will stun you or maybe Enlighten you. For sure it will enterain you. It is an absolutely unique experience. For action lovers, there's plenty to rock any action junkie. Swords splatter blood, body parts sail every which way; you'll have trouble sitting still. Same getting-rocked problem hits for aficionados of hot dance routines with all-out dancing with suprising Asians doing exotic Bollywood verve (with their trademark energy) Then flow into Spanish/Mexican rhythms done like you've never heard before.

 Surprise: Dororo takes place in 3064. This is a very unusual mystical SciFi concept with a feudal twist in an apocalyptic time. Great special effects keep hitting you for the film's 139 minutes of action and intrigue with great production values throughout.

One last note: There are several DVD versions of Dororo. Reading reviews I chose a yellow-green cover with the subtitle ""The Quest of a Samurai Warrior (actually a misleading subhead this Dororo is much more complex and original).

3228934,4,B000X0IKZ4,"This is one wild movie. It's a sprawling sci-fi, fantasy epic set in 3085 Japan that looks more like it's set in feudal Japan. No spaceships or crazy weapons. Just swords, knives, samurai armor and the like. But it's loaded with magic and demons, great sword play and stunts and a way cool story.

Here's the scoop. Dad wants to conquer the world, so he promises 48 demons his unborn son to achieve this. Son is born with a head and body. No feet, legs, hands or arms. Dad's going to kill the son and send him to the demons. Mom won't let him and sends the son adrift in a reed basket a' la Moses. A man finds the boy and builds him a flesh and blood (sort of) body which is self healing and the hands can be removed to reveal swords. Son now is on a quest to kill the 48 demons. Every one he kills will restore a body part that was previously missing. He hooks up with a feisty female thief (Dororo of the title) and the two are off on the great adventure.

This is one of the wildest, weirdest movies I've ever seen. The set-up itself is unique and the adventures are equally weird. You meet all manner of demons and situations that the hero and thief must deal with. And it's all wonderful. There are great characters here and the story plays out well. The costumes and sets are good. The fight scenes are generally choreographed and directed well. The effects are a hoot. Some are decent enough CGI while some are man in a rubber suit fun like the old Godzilla movies. There's a playfulness to all of it but without letting the impact of the story diminish.

This film also has a good look to it. The sets and costuming are very good. The music is eclectic. Some is Asian, some is Mexican, some is American mountain sounding and it ends with a heavy rock tune. The directing is generally good with a lot of clever, nifty touches. There's a great use of the landscape as well as some nicely designed interiors. What really propels this though are the two leads. It's his story, but her name is the the title and she becomes more important as the film progresses. And at 2 hours and 18 minutes it's a long (but by no means slow) progress.

This is a truly good/great movie. There are a ton of things going on and it moves like a freight train. There is always something happening with bouts of humor to keep things from getting too serious. The two leads do a great job and I found myself falling for Dororo by the end of the film. She's a real hoot and she has an arresting face.

3228937,4,B000X0IKZ4,"I love this movie!  I saw it as a free on demand movie a while back and enjoyed it so much I bought it.  It is a little weird...it's based on a japanese manga  about a boy who must kill 48 demons to reclaim his true body.  It is different, which may be why I like it so much.",1268092800,,275,3.610169491525424
3228938,4,B000X0IKZ4,"A warlord on the brink of defeat pledges the life of his son to 48 demons, in exchange for the power to subdue his enemies.  The scavenged boy, now a bare soul in a lump of flesh, is saved by a shaman, who constructs body parts for him from the bodies of young children destroyed in battle, and commits him to avenge their souls by struggling against war.  He must also win back his body parts from the 48 demons who have taken them in order to become flesh and wreak havoc.  Along the way he meets a nameless thief, a young woman who was also abandoned at childhood, when the warlord killed her parents.  What follows is an unusual love story and revenge tale that turns into a quest for redemption, with a bunch of fun swordplay with inventive, if also a bit silly, Yokai-style demons.  The bloody explosions that ensued when a demon was destroyed, combined with the sometimes hokey but always unusual costumes of the demons, reminded me a bit of old school horror like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Evil-Dead/dp/B00005R24K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Evil Dead</a>, but with a major Japanese twist, and a bit of CGI thrown in there for some of the more unusual effects.  It's unintentionally funny at times, and maybe takes itself too seriously, but it's fun to watch and has a number of intriguing twists in a storyline that is mostly successful in avoiding cliche.  I wouldn't call this a masterpiece, but it was a lot of fun to watch.",1266364800,,1492,4.896825396825397
3228939,4,B000X0IKZ4,"The movie is in Japanese with english subtitles but it won't matter the subject matter comes across crystal clear for us english speaking folks. I loved the use of fantasy elements in this movie it was like watching a really cool video game with a great story. The main character is so sad and serious so the girl/thief is a perfect comedic element and the way she gets spattered everytime hekills a demon is hilarious. I'd call this an action packed Japanese fantasy but it really has just about everything in it. drama, comedy, horror, actio, romance, and even intrigue. A definate movie to check out",1264896000,,602,4.688679245283019
3228940,4,B000X0IKZ4,"From defeat in a bloody battle, his armor riddled with arrows, Lord Daigo enters a temple that houses the 48 carved statues of demons. There, despite a priest's warning, he makes a pact, seeking power over his enemies at first, then reaching for power over the world. In exchange, he agrees to the  demons' desire--the body of his soon to be born child. Daigo's forehead is marked to seal the dread pact.

Move forward some years, and a palm reader reads a hooded man's hand and asks: ""Didn't you die a long time ago?"" The hooded stranger, revealed to be a handsome fighter of skill and some highly unusual limb-related abilities,  engages in battle with a masked demon. When he wins, we see his prosthetic lower leg be replaced with a real one that magically grows in.

A female-dressed-as-male thief sees this astonishing regeneration and seeks information on the stranger from a traveling minstrel--be he man or monster. The minstrel relates the tale, of which he was part witness and which feels very much fairy tale meets Moses tale meets Frankenstein, of how a baby with missing body parts is reescued and ""completed"" by a healer's exceptional skills. This part of the film has a lovely folkloric quality about it, and the visuals are partly grotesque, partly moving, aided by the semi-lullaby sound of the soundtrack. The healer's cottage verges on the steampunky.

And so we enter the quest of the grown man--who is sometimes called Hyakkimaru, the name on the blade in his left arm-- to obtain once more the parts of his body that were sacrificed in infancy and his vengeance-driven thief sidekick--who dubs herself Dororo, a name that could equally apply to the strange man of removable limbs as the meaning of ""dororo"" is little monster. Like most good fantasy/fairy tales, we have a special weapon forged to kill magical creatures (goblins, demons), a mentor in the Shaman who gives Hyakkimaru his regenerated body, and allies and antagonists along the way, not all demonic. The horrors of war and warlord tyranny runs through the whole of the film.

Some of the demons are cool (the spidery one, the moth one), some not so much (the heinously awful reptile one should have been edited out, honestly); the composite child spirits was awkward). But by the time the climactic showdown comes, and we see the weird family dynamic at work between Hyakkumaru and his kin, we end up feeling sorry for a host of folks, because the father's initial act of child sacrifice has some ugly repercussions. Will reunion bring vengeance, redemption, good, bad?

I will note that this is not a complete story--by film's end, Hyakkimaru has obtained only half of his demon-confiscated body parts. But the tale still has a satisfactory conclusion, with character growth and tragedy and a bit of redemption.

I enjoyed it visually (mostly) and storywise (mostly). And the actor who plays Hyakkimaru is a hottie. (Bonus!) The English subtitles didn't seem odd (like in some subbed films I've seen from Asia), and the actors did a very good job.

3228941,5,B000X0IKZ4,"*Spoiler Free* I was looking through my Free Movies selection on my DVR and came across Dororo. Being a fan of movies whether they're subtitled or not, reading the plot, I thought to myself, Hmm this sounds kind of like Inuyasha, and loving that story I decided to watch Dororo. Wow...so much better than I had ever thought possible. The special effects are good for the most part with pretty good characters throughout the story. The movie keeps you watching with anticipation of what will happen next. On a personal note, I was kind of dissapointed with how the movie ended but even then, I gave the movie 5 stars. Hope the review helped and you're not disappointed.",1250035200,,668,4.669491525423729

It feels what I would expect an anime to translate into.  The combination of CGI with rubber suits for the monsters was priceless.  The story was compelling and very interesting, I loved the action scenes, and the ending was sad and beautiful.  Unlike other live action animes (Dragonball evolution UGHH) This had just the right combination of bad and good.  I watched it numerous times when it was on Netflix, definitely going to buy this to add to my collection of good bad films.",1490659200,,605,4.704761904761905
