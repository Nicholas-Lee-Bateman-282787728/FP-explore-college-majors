8348393,4,B00200KHRE,"While the production quality leaves something to be desired, it is not a big distraction because the content is so rich and rewarding.  You can learn a lot about why folks pursue crime, and popular crime myths will be shattered along the way (the usual tired explanations for crime fall flat after you see this). The content resonates with what we know about crime, but too often experts shy away from it because it does not fit with convenient socio-political views and orientations.  Dr. Fauteck has provided an incredible public service by offering this affordable DVD.  'Hopefully some offenders will be helped by it.  And there are some life lessons drawn here that should be good reminders for anybody.  But the educational value alone is more than worth the price of admission. Thank you Dr. Fauteck.  A+ for substantive content.",1430524800,,836,4.935714285714286
8348394,5,B00200KHRE,"This is a compelling, instructional felon-to-felon video that any ex con will find very easy and calming to
watch. The authority and reasonableness of Dr. Paul Fauteck's voice is a thing of beauty. The no frills,
close-cropped image of Dr. Fauteck who is dressed in neutral tones, along with the rhythm, the phrasing
of his words has a certain messmerizing quality. Its effect is to take the confrontational edge off his
straight forward message of personal responsibility. This former felon, who deliberately chose his career
in crime at age 13, knows the streets, the cons and how they con themselves as well as society. For
anyone who works with offenders, this video can be a true pathfinder.",1248134400,,696,4.957264957264957
8348395,5,B00200KHRE,"This video is full of great advice on how to turn your life around for good. It focuses on people recently released from prison and has some great information on how not to end up back behind bars. Dr. Paul Fauteck is a ""regular guy"" who's been there before and knows what to do and what not to do. From what I understand, he makes no profit on sales of this video. It is definitely worth the price.
