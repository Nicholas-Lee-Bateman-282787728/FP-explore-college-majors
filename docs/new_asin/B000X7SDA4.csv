When the item arrived in the UK from the USA the case was damaged. It is not possible to say whether the disc had been pirated. As is often the case with these rarities the labelling was unsophisticated. It is possible to download a choice of copies of this old classic from the internet archive website. My hope, in making this purchase, was that I would be getting a better defined copy. This was not the case. Not only was the picture quality inferior, but half the movie was missing.
The story is based in two of Doyle's stories: 'The Final Problem' and 'The Empty House' but, since the first of these isn't much of a story, most of the plot comes from the second. There is a harrowing murder depicted in the opening sequence which this reviewer finds to be a little too strong. Almost total darkness prevails but the very vocal, drawn out, death agonies of the victim are almost too real. The rest of the movie is a rattling good yarn with Wontner in fine avuncular form as Holmes. The rest of the cast are excellent also but don't expect fidelity to Doyle everywhere. The action is set in the early thirties.
This version by REEL CLASSIC FILMS appears to have been chopped down from the original. The retained scenes are kept in the correct order but huge lumps have been excised making the story hard to follow. I cannot understand why anyone would deliberately remove important sequences in that way. Perhaps the original piece of film used for this release had been cut down to fit a particular timescale. Even if the movie had not been cannibalised I could not commend this version to others. The picture quality is terrible. It is both blurred and unstable. You may download a better copy from the internet archive, and one which hasn't been tampered with. Maybe one day someone will attempt a decent restoration of Arthur Wontner's Holmes movies. They deserve better than this.",1333324800,,2027,4.571428571428571
8227093,5,B000X7SDA4,"Like thousands of others I am a fan of Sherlock Holmes.  In fact, in my case, it goes beyond the norm.  I have always enjoyed the Wontner films and feel that he looked and acted more like the real Holmes than many of the following actors who came after him.  This film borrows heavily on FINAL PROBLEM - even though the title is ""The Sleeping Cardinal"".  It also borrows from that ultimate stage actor - William Gillette - and his play SHERLOCK HOLMES.  Being a vintage film you have to be forgiving regarding the quality of the film.  Personally I prefer the black & white films(like this) over the colored variety.  It is more in keeping with the era of the original Holmes.  Overall the production appears more to be a stage play based on the sets in the film.  You feel as if you were watching Holmes on the stage - more appropriate to the era.  All together a fun film for a serious Holmes buff and an excellent introduction to vintage Holmes for the person just getting on to the Holmes bandwagon.",1214352000,2,1003,4.4021739130434785
8227094,1,B000X7SDA4,"I purchased this dvd from Amazon with great anticipation of seeing a long-lost Arthur Wontner ""Sherlock Holmes"" film.  First of all, this is NOT a standard Region 1 DVD as stated.  It is a DVD-R of such poor quality that it would not play at all on two of my three players.  I finally got it to play--well, sort of-- on another one of my players. All three of my players are okay with other DVD-Rs but not this disc.  The picture jumped and freeze framed throughout the film. Save your money on this amateurish effort.  Perhaps, someday, it may become available on a real DVD. Amazon, mercifully, refunded my money when I returned the item.
UPDATE!!!: A great quality dvd version of this film has been released as part of THE SHERLOCK HOLMES ARCHIVE COLLECTION Volume 1 (a 3 disc set from Synergy Home Video).  The set also contains many other rare Sherlock goodies--any Sherlockian will be more than pleased!",1210809600,4,909,4.614906832298137
