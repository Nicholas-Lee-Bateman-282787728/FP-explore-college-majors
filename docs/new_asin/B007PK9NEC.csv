5103126,5,B007PK9NEC,"Uncharacteristically, Alpha Films has released an excellent, authorized transfer of a very rare film.  The film is letterboxed and uncut, and the disc includes a documentary about director William Alland.

The film is an entertaining ""dark"" portrait of American suburbia in the early 1960's.  Alcoholic Alex Nicol's unfulfilled wife Ruth Roman is playing around with the neighborhood stud (Jack Cassidy).  Paul Anka and Gigi Perreau play the teenage offspring of the unhappy suburbanites, and the teens have troubles of their own.  Meanwhile, a creep in a monster mask is peeping at the suburban shenanigans while terrorizing the community in the process.

The teens' problems take a back seat to the foibles of their elders, as the film lurches between exploitation and camp.  There's still a core of seriousness to the drama, with these adults being unable to behave as positive role models.  This was never an ""Adults Only"" picture, but it probably didn't play in very many second-run ""family"" theaters.

I'd recommend the disc to those who love rare films from the early sixties.  This DVD represents a home video premiere, as the film was never released on commercial VHS.  A really nice surprise from Alpha Films!",1359936000,6,1219,5.137055837563452

8520375,4,B007PK9NEC,"I HAD MIXED FEELINGS WHEN I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE. I HATE PAUL ANKA, BUT I LOVE THE OTHER ACTORS IN THE FILM. I SAW THIS FILM IN MY LOCAL THEATRE WHEN IT FIRST HIT THE SCREEN ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. I ENJOYED IT, BUT I HATED PAUL ANKA BACK THEN AND STILL DO. MY WIFE LOVES HIM. SHE HAD SEEN ANKA LIVE IN LAS VEGAS MORE THAN 40 YEARS AGO AND SHE NEVER STOPPED TALKING ABOUT ANKA SINGING TO HER WHILE SHE SAT IN THE AUDIENCE. SHE ALSO LIKES WAYNE NEWTON AND FORCED ME TO SEE HIM IN LAS VEGAS ABOUT 37 YEARS AGO. HE CHARGED MORE TO SEE HIM THAN EVERY OTHER STAR ON THE VEGAS STRIP. IT WAS ONE OF THE WORSE NIGHTS OF MY LIFE. IN CONCLUSION, MY WIFE LOVES THIS ANKA MOVIE AND IT BRINGS BACK FOND MEMORIES. I WILL DO ANYTHING TO MAKE MY WIFE HAPPY,",1503705600,,738,3.8940397350993377
8520376,5,B007PK9NEC,"BEAUTIFUL MOVIE!

The plot was very understandable and interesting. Paul Anka was absolutely GORGEOUS in this movie, and was very cute with Gigi Perreau. Ruth Roman did a wonderful job acting, as always! Definitely a great movie that I can watch over and over again but I wish it was available on iTunes.

As for the condition of the movie (disk) itself, it was very neat with a clear picture and audio. The movie was in wonderful condition.",1487116800,2,441,4.641025641025641

8520379,5,B007PK9NEC,"Compelling, sardonic story about adolescent turmoil.  Alex Nichol is great in the role of the boy's dad.  And a very seductive Ruth Roman, as well.  Writer, Laurence Mascott, and director, William Alland, showed a good grasp of the social mores of the time.  Fantastic restoration of an obscure classic, starring Paul Anka.  Yes, *Paul Anka*.  Compare to Martin Ritt's and Philip Yordan's ""No Down Payment.""",1420588800,,407,5.184615384615385

8520383,5,B007PK9NEC,"Made quickly in seven days Look In Any Window packs a punch. A film about suburban life in 1961, it focuses on the parents lives, more than the usual look at teenagers. Ruth Roman does a great job as Paul Anka's mother.",1369440000,2,219,4.238095238095238
