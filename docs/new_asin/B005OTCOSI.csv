4854631,5,B005OTCOSI,"I just bought and watched this movie, and I must say it is a new favorite of mine--and I am a writer and lover of literature and know good aesthetics! The movie is about giving oneself totally in Love, about relinquishing the ego in order to fully engage with Being (life and afterlife); embody the Truth, Goodness, Beauty, and Love of Being; and to reap the full and fresh harvest of ever cultivating Love, meeting, touching, improving, and sharing in the lives of those around us.

Also, I bought the movie new, and IT DID HAVE ENGLISH SUBTITLES--great, accurate ones that stayed true to the voice, elegance, beauty, style, and meaning of the original Spanish.

While I absolutely loved the movie, my only complaint--and warning--is with the previews for other movies preceding the DVD menu. The previews were of movies reminiscent of the videogame Grand Theft Auto: guns, thugs, whores, cars, ""tetas,"" etc. I think this cheap advertising does a disservice to the work of art that is this movie, and it is necessary that any Spanish teachers or parents out there to skip to the DVD menu (or skip forward scenes or fast-forward--whatever your DVD player will allow).

Acabo de comprar y mirar esta pelicula. Es una obra de arte y al menos la versin actual tiene subttulos ingleses precisos y estticos. Esta es una pelicula hermosa sobre vivir la vida con amor totalmente, sobre dar todo de su mismo--todo su vida--al Amor. Es mi pelicula favorita ya.

Mientras que la pelicula es buensima, los avances antes de la pelicula son vulgares, groseros, escandalosos, y es necessario que enseadores o padres se salten estos.",1445558400,11,1618,4.872727272727273

4854659,5,B005OTCOSI,"This is a wonderful movie,good for families ,very different from other movies that I have seen lately, a joy to watch,morality and values are noticed, some scenes are very strong especially the one about the teenager who uses drugs,it also shows the value of human life from conception. I saw it with a group of friends about a month ago, and decided to buy two copies, one to keep here and the other for a friend.",1320710400,,414,4.4605263157894735

4854663,5,B005OTCOSI,"El Estudiante is an amazing movie, worth the watch! I really enjoyed it, but wished it had subtitles in English because even though I speak Spanish, I am not Mexican and so I do not speak/understand Mexican slang! There were also parts of the movie in which the audio was too low to understand the dialogue. It's a very clean movie. The only nearly ""questionable"" scene is of a young couple making out, which almost leads to more before the woman objects. Other themes include pregnancy out of wedlock, drug use, and death. All in all, though, it's a great movie that teaches about life and how some values should never be compromised no matter how much time passes! I just wish it wasn't so expensive to buy!",1278720000,4,709,4.546875
4854664,5,B005OTCOSI,"This is the best Mexican movie I have ever seen.  Great acting, beautiful scenery, great values, inspiring story... and there is no bad language nor sexual scenes!  Kudos to the producer Roberto Giraud, and to one of my favorite ""voices"" Jorge Lavat (who I listen to on you-tube, poetry reading)
I wish it had subtitles both in English and in Spanish, both to share it with friends in the US and to teach Spanish in High School and College classes.
Please release version with subtitles!",1276473600,19,487,4.7176470588235295
4854665,5,B005OTCOSI,"I saw this movie at the Mexican film festival in Sydney, twice. The first time my friends and I stayed back talking about this movie. When we finally looked up from discussion we where the only ones left in the cinema. I'm definitely getting this DVD but would request that English subtitles be included, but for now I'm brushing up on my spanish.",1273017600,8,347,4.523809523809524
4854666,5,B005OTCOSI,"I saw this movie at the Latino film festival here in Chicago last spring and have been awaiting it's arrival on DVD.  It's a wonderful movie, one that I will watch many times. Aside from really good acting and a great story, it has wonderful scenery from the Mexican colonial city of Guanajuato. It was shown at the film festival with English subtitles so I know they have been created for the film.  PLEASE release a version with them--my Spanish isn't strong enough to really appreciate the movie without them.",1262995200,10,512,4.677777777777778

8481891,5,B005OTCOSI,"Awesome Spanish movie... great for showing in high school Spanish classes because they do not talk so wildly fast as some.
Would be too ""racy"" for middle school or younger classroom settings.",1505174400,,191,5.0
8481892,3,B005OTCOSI,"The movie had good actors and messages, but the lessons that the main character tries to teach his young classmates were limited to what the plot allowed. For example, in one scene he angrily tells the young men to NOT think of/treat women and girls as objects; but rather to treat them well like he does his own wife, but I never felt that these guys took this message to heart in the scenes that follow. I never sensed that there was much human growth in most of the characters. The movie just went through the plot and conflicts and then it was over. Seems like this movie had so much potential that were never realized.  Also, it would have been great to have English subtitles. Then I could have shared it with more people.",1503014400,,728,4.392592592592592
