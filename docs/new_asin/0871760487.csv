8167701,4,0871760487,"This film is not yet available on a true DVD, at least, not in North American format.  In trying to avoid DVD-r versions of this product, I searched long and hard for VHS editions.  One VHS edition I refused to buy because its advertised running time was only 72 minutes, whereas the IMDb gives 78 minutes as the length of the film.  Then on Amazon.com I came across this Video Film Classics edition.  It was put out by Kartes Video Communications, Inc. as part of a series of old films on VHS, back in the early days of VHS.  The date given on the back of the VHS clamshell is 1984 and the ISBN given is 0-87176-048-7.

The running time of the VHS is listed as 90 minutes on the clamshell, but that is not the length of the movie.  The movie itself runs about 79:15, after which there is an interesting advertisement/featurette (about 3 or 4 minutes in length) for a society of old film lovers that one can join, with some background on the Video Film Classics series -- how and why it was produced.  It looks as if many of the films available in 2014 only on DVD-r can be found in this series, so if you are stumped, try looking up Kartes Video Communications, or Video Film Classics, both on Amazon.com and on Google -- you may find some rare old VHS of the film you want.  Of course, you would have to check with the vendor in each case for running times, but at least this gives a possible lead.  Anyhow, at about 83 minutes, the VHS ends, and the minutes up to 90 are blank -- after which the tape automatically rewinds.  So the 90-minute running time is not right, but still, at 79:15, this version of the movie is a minute longer than the 78 minutes listed on the IMDb.  So either this version contains about a minute of lost material not found elsewhere, or the difference of a minute is a mere technological artifact -- the speed of play of a VHS or DVD can vary by a few percent.  But even if this is only the equivalent of a 78-minute DVD version, it is still the complete film.

The picture in the film is clear, but in spots -- especially where the colors are light -- faded.  The image often lacks texture.  This is understandable.  VHS images are often like this, especially in VHS tapes that are 20 or 30 years old.  (This one is 30 years old.)  They seem to lose some depth and firmness.  Whether this has to do with the nature of magnetic media such as videotape, I don't know.  The sound is uneven.  In the first half of the video, you have to turn it up pretty loud to compensate for the softness, but the price you pay for that is some tape hissing.  In the second half, suddenly the sound comes ""alive"" and you can turn the volume down again.  This often happens with old films, whether on VHS or DVD, that have not been well-preserved and for which only a small number of prints still exist.

This film could use a proper restoration by someone like Criterion.  It is a good enough adventure/mystery film that it would be very enjoyable with crisp sound and good, rich black-and-white images.  As it stands, it is still enjoyable for the story, but you definitely get that ""I'm watching a very old movie on late night TV"" feeling, and you tend the give the film a lower ranking than it really deserves, because of the inferior physical presentation.

The movie was later remade by Hammer in the 1960s as Night Creatures.  The Hammer remake is stylish, in color, and seems snappier, more modern in style, and more entertaining.  However, the superiority of the remake would be much less if one could compare the remake with a really good polished version of the 1937 film.  But in fact, even the Hammer film is not available right now in any good prints; my dream would be for Criterion or someone similar to remaster both films as a set.  I would gladly pay $40 for such a DVD.

The director is Roy William Neill of Universal fame.  The actors are very good, though the style is 1930s British rather than 1930s American or 1960s Hammer British (as in the remake).  Everything is a little stiffer, a little more formal, and more subdued.  But once you allow for the stylistic difference, the film is very enjoyable.  The performance of George Arliss as Dr. Syn is noteworthy.  Margaret Lockwood is a beautiful heroine, doing very well in playing her basically one-dimensional role.  Roy Emerton as Capt. Collyer is very good as well, perhaps better than his counterpart in the 1960s Hammer film.  Many of the supporting cast put a touch of humor into their performances, which is suitable to this sort of film.

I have not yet watched any of the available DVD-r versions of this film currently on the market.  DVD-r  products almost all skip on my player, so I try to avoid them.  Thus, I am unable to say whether or not the picture or sound are better on DVD-r versions than on this VHS tape.  I am also unable to comment on the completeness of various DVD-r versions.  All I can say is that if you want the entire film, don't buy anything that is less than 78 minutes.  This Video Film Classics version has the whole film.",1416268800,,5047,4.394822006472492
8167702,5,0871760487,"I have been looking for a recording of this movie since I owned my first VCR and I finally found it on DVD.  As an old movie officianado and a fan of the story (I saw The Scarecrow on the Wonderful World of Disney about 50 years ago and went on to see Peter Cushing's version and read Russell Thorndyke's book), I have to say that I liked this version the best of all three films.  George Arliss had to be one of the finest actors who ever appeared on the screen or the stage, and his performance in this movie is no exception.  It was the original movie version, and the screenplay is well done: definitely closer to Thorndyke's novel than the Disney version.  It is worth getting the DVD just to see Arliss's performance.  I was also very pleased with the engineering, as many movies of that era that were not shown for many years ended up in terrible shape when transferred to another media.  This one came out very well.  A really classic performance.",1408665600,,955,4.361581920903955
8167703,4,0871760487,"Being a Dr. Syn fan, I had to see this movie. I enjoyed it. It's very much like the book. Different from the Disney.",1391904000,2,116,3.875
8167704,3,0871760487,"This is a first class British film from 1937.  George Arliss is in top form as the former pirate captain now the vicar Dr. Syn.

There are however, a couple of problems:

1.  It is a DVD-R rather than a pressing (as noted correctly by a previous reviewer), so it will not be as permanent as a normal DVD. Furthermore, some players may have trouble with this format.

2.  The image quality is acceptable, but not great. There is some fading in places.

3.  American viewers would benefit from subtitles, especially when the working class characters speak.  I lived in England for thirteen years, and yet I had trouble following some of the dialogue because of this lack of subtitles.

Overall I would have given four stars, except for the above problems which caused me to deduct a star.",1337644800,3,786,4.589928057553957
8167705,3,0871760487,"Five stars for the film, one star for the product, so three on the average.  Beware, for despite being noted as a proper, pressed DVD in Amazon's description, and on the DVD packaging, and even on the disc itself, this is a recorded DVD-R, NOT a DVD, so will NOT play on many players.  That said, the print is reasonable, the story good, and George Arliss is a wonderful actor of the type one doesn't often see these days.",1325721600,6,422,4.329113924050633
