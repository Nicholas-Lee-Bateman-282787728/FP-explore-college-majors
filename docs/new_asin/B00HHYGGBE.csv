6166202,3,B00HHYGGBE,It was a throwback to 80s horror..but it didn't do anything for me. It's worth a rental but I paid full price.,1401840000,3,110,4.045454545454546
6166203,2,B00HHYGGBE,"I love all kinds of horror movies, whether it's high budget or low budget and cheesy. Scream Park however, was terrible. I tried twice to watch this all the way through. I was bored with all of it. I made it about 20 minutes or so in and that was it. Acting was terrible. Don't watch this!",1399766400,4,289,4.087719298245614
6166204,2,B00HHYGGBE,"The film starts with the opening credits. No prologue as most slasher films have to hint at the identity of the killer. Fright Land is going to shut down due to lack of funds. The film centers on Jennifer ( Wendy Wygant) our token virgin. Blake, her boyfriend of three dates, who hasn't made it to second base is missing. We don't know if he is the killer or victim until 10 minutes from the end.

The kids decide to throw a party, locked inside the park, although they can climb the fence. One by one the folks disappear by guys in masks. Doug Bradly makes a cameo appearance one hour into the film to supply a motive.

The film lacked the horror build up. The killings were okay and at times bloody, but just didn't have that 80's slasher feel it was attempting to achieve.  Will do fine as a Redbox rental. The DVD cover claims 96 minutes. The film is 84 minutes. Blooper reel 6 minutes.

6166205,3,B00HHYGGBE,"Nowadays, it seems as if the trend in slasher flicks is not to push the envelope of creativity, but to take us back to their origins, back to the early years when they truly started to flourish.  Many of the press releases for slasher films that I receive tout these films as throwbacks or homages to the glory days, which usually means they are low-budget and low-quality.  This is all fine and good, and don't get me wrong:  I enjoy many of these films as much as any horror fan.  But Im starting to crave originality.  SCREAM PARK is one of these films that attempts to capture the spark of vintage slashers.  And while it is entertaining in a few aspects, the film as a whole doesnt meet up to my expectations.

Horror flicks that are set in amusement parks or carnivals are a special treat for me; I love the concept of terrifying and/or horrific events happening at places that are supposedly renowned for good times and fun.  I guess the contrast itself is what draws me.  Theres a lot that can happen in one of these places, not to mention a lot of different ways to kill off characters!

Unfortunately, SCREAM PARK doesnt offer very many interesting ways for its cast to die.  Sure, theres a body countbut I wanted to see people run over by bumper cars or slung from the Tilt-a-whirl into piano wire.  The killers could have sprinkled the funnel cakes with Comet or even used someones head as a test-your-strength platform.  The options in an amusement park are endless; sadly, the production team for this film didn't look into them.

I do like the killers in SCREAM PARK, though; they are ambiguous and sinister, just like the bad guys in a slasher flick should be.  Not only that, but they wear freaky masks, too.  This heightens the sense of suspense for the audience, as it makes the killer appear less human and therefore more terrifying.

I wish I could say some positive things about the cast in SCREAM PARK, but I simply cannot.  This film has some of the worst acting in a low-budget feature that Ive ever seen.  Some bad acting is forgivable; this is not.  The only actor worthy of being called such is Doug Bradley, who fright fans will know as Pinhead from the HELLRAISER series.  Much to my chagrin, Bradley is only onscreen for about five minutes in the whole film, which makes me want to scream False advertising! to the person that designed the DVD cover (his name is at the top of the cover, making it seem like hes the star).

Still, with all of the negatives aside, SCREAM PARK managed to be slightly entertaining.  I stopped looking at it from an originality standpoint and started looking at it as a simple, B-grade slasher film; doing so helped me actually enjoy a bit of it, especially once the killers start stalking everyone.  Oh, and there is a pretty nice twist at the very end that made me smile.

All in all, I will say SCREAM PARK is a watch-at-your-own-risk horror film.  Some of you will like it, but many of you will hate it.  I say check it out and make your own decision.  The film is available now.",1398297600,,3044,4.475499092558984
6166206,1,B00HHYGGBE,"Let me start by saying I'm a huge horror fan. I love gory, cheesy and even stupid horror movies. As long as they are charming or have some kind of redeeming quality. I wanted to like this movie. I just couldn't. The best parts are the horrible acting and the amusement park setting. Which is creepy after hours anyway. One of the killers is like a generic, watered down rip off of Leatherhead. I wasted $10 dollars on this. Watch You're Next if you want to see a decent slasher flick...",1398211200,3,486,4.351648351648351
6166207,3,B00HHYGGBE,"I was pretty excited about this movie. It looked very interesting from the trailer that I saw online. I came into this movie expected a unique plot about a theme park killer, but I came out of the movie barely awake.

This movie did have some interesting aspects. The theme park was pretty cool, for the 10 minutes that was shown of rides operating. It reminded me of one that I visited as a child. Also some of the cast members were very easy on the eyes, with one young lady in particular that we get to see in the flesh for a quick moment ;)

Overall this movie did not have very much action. It seemed to run long even at its measly 1:25 running length. This is the type of movie that will probably end up in a $5 horror movie pack at Wal-Mart in not too short of time.

In conclusion this movie was mildly entertaining, had some hot chicks, but did not deliver the full package of Gore and action. Decent low budget flick, but had the possibility for more.",1398211200,4,961,4.211956521739131
6166208,5,B00HHYGGBE,"got to see this at the eerie horrorfest in erie pa. in oct 2013 it was a lot of fun to see an 80's style  horror film on the 60 foot  screen at the warner theater,this  will be a part of my collection as soon as it is released,doug Bradley  has a small part in the film was a guest at the eerie horrorfest ,it was shot locally in Conneaut lake pa. at Conneaut lake park except for  doug bradleys scenes,any horror fans who have not been to the eerie horrorfest I highly recommend it,its usually the 3rd week in October and is always a good time",1393632000,5,544,4.046728971962617
6166209,4,B00HHYGGBE,"I remember buying this movie several months ago on its official website. While watching it, I had the most fun I've had since my last bowel movement. It made me jump. It made me laugh. It made me fart. I think they should make a sequel called Scream Toilet.",1390262400,3,257,4.26530612244898

6166242,1,B00HHYGGBE,This was your pretty standard slasher movie. The problem is that whoever wrote the blurb on the back of the package decided to give away the twist ending. There is NO EXCUSE for something like that. And for fans of Doug Bradley - he's hardly even in it. Don't waste your time.,1410825600,4,276,4.326923076923077
6166243,3,B00HHYGGBE,"I'm really not certain how many stars to give this.  I picked this up with points because my friend's previous band (RBD) is featured in the film, so it's a neat piece of their short-lived history to have.  Other than that, the acting, writing, cinematography and overall production are atrocious.  However, my friend and I did laugh our asses off because of those things, so for that (and the band memorabilia it is for us) I give it three stars.",1408665600,,447,4.5625

6166245,4,B00HHYGGBE,It is good to see a film that pays homage to the slasher genre that is so close to my heart. I'm also a huge fan of Conneaut Lake Park where this was filmes. It was really fun to see all the places i recognize in the park. This film is every bit as campy as the genre is well known for. Trully makese feel like I'm back in the 80s which to me is the golden age of horror flicks.,1404864000,,378,3.6790123456790123
6166246,2,B00HHYGGBE,This movie was pretty bad. The acting of everyone BUT Ogre and Doug Bradley was beyond B movie status. Certainly did not live up to its potential.,1404777600,3,146,4.444444444444445
6166247,5,B00HHYGGBE,"This is a really great slasher homage that harkens back to the crop of solid, low budget slasher films that were released in the 1980s. Scream Park takes itself very seriously, gets down to business and there's none of the wink wink or spoofy elements found in Hatchet and other current slasher retro movies.",1404000000,3,308,4.722222222222222

8632942,4,B00HHYGGBE,"Doug Bradley (hellraiser) and Ogre (the Devils Carnival) are quite enjoyable in this slasher film set in a theme park. I loved the setting. The look of the park at night was eerie and rather creepy.  And both Bradley and Orgre gave a great performance.

This film doesn't offer anything new. Its a standard low budget film. The acting from some of the victims range from okay to could've been a lot better. But no one was painfully awful.

I watched this with a group of friends and most seemed to enjoy it. the film was well paced and the setting made the film. I wish more films would have such sets.",1469491200,,602,4.357142857142857

8632947,1,B00HHYGGBE,I love horror movies but this might be the worst. Thought this movie had potential but this was a disappointment. The acting is very unconvincing. You can easily find a better movie. You could buy two movies that are better & not spend as much.,1423094400,,244,4.444444444444445

8632949,3,B00HHYGGBE,"This film wasn't as bad as some people say although it certainty isn't great either. I liked the old school feel and the amusement park setting. Most of the acting was sub par but good enough that you didn't check out of the story!

The kills were not bad but they used methods that didn't need much effect ,if any, most of the time. There was a bit of gore but only used with one kill not including a decapitated head wrapped in cellophane but there was a nice am out of blood and bloodshed.

I would recommend it to die hard slasher fans that love all the clich's that come with them.",1414108800,,586,4.176991150442478
