8726941,5,B013322WYS,"This is by far the best directed Cavalleria Rusticana I have ever seen.  Because the opera was submitted to Concorso Sonzogno in which he was the winner. Due to the condition that submitted opera must be 1 Act opera, there are many problems in the libretto, It is unnatural that Turiddo sings an aria to his mother to protect Santuzza right after he kicked her out of his life. Mr. Grischa Asagaroff did a marvelous directing by adding a small action of Santuzza indicating that she is pregnant. This made the whole opera logically acceptable. Even Zeffirelli and McVicar could not come up with such a brilliant idea. Yes, opera is irrational. But stage director must make it plausible to the audience so that audience's attention will not astray. Tokio K. OHSKA",1479945600,,762,4.7727272727272725
8726942,3,B013322WYS,"This is a 2008, no-frills ""Cav & Pag,"" built around solid dual performances by Argentine tenor Jos&eacute; Cura.  Also well served are the sizzling Santuzza of Paoletta Marrocu and the Silvio of barihunk Gabriel Bermudez.  Director Grischa Asagaroff makes some odd, detrimental choices, some small (there was certainly no breakdancing in the 1940s), some not-so-small (having Lola live directly next door to Tiriddu in ""Cavalleria Rusticana"" makes no dramatic sense whatsoever, as well as contradicts the libretto); otherwise this is a safe, unimaginatively staged production.  At this price, though, why would you not make the investment?",1460160000,,639,5.635416666666667
8726943,4,B013322WYS,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 120"" screen and listen through a 7.2 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround / surround back speakers are placed where they ought to be. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls and ceiling. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

My collection includes the 1982 Zeffirelli movie with Domingo/Obraztsova which has a 5.1 DTS sound track and has been played many many times. I tried the Teatro Real blu-ray version some years ago and was disappointed with that surround sound in the Cav. Finally another blu-ray, this time from the Opernhaus Zuerich.

Menu allows to choose between Cav and Pag, but you have to resort to the pop-up key to select audio and subtitles. A minor annoyance. You would think that after so many years of menu design you would get one with all the options on the first screen.

Picture is fine as usual with blu-rays.
Sound is DTS 7.1 HD, you can't get it much better than that.

Orchestra is recorded quite detailed, sound stage is pretty much 180 degrees. Balance with chorus and voices is fine. It's a body mics recording with the voices mostly coming from the middle, my only small complaint. I liked all the voices and the direction is also somewhat conservative, even a progressively more drunken Pag is acceptable to me. It is also well acted by most principals.

This is quite a step-up in sound quality compared to the Zeffirelli film, especially Obraztsova's voice, which is a bit harsh, so it's a heartfelt So long Placido, hello Jose.

As I can't give it 4.5 stars, I give it 4 stars, as I still prefer the voices moving across the stage a bit more than they do here.

The Bonus feature has only stereo sound, so it's not worth much to me. But if it lowers the price of this Blu-ray, who would complain?",1455408000,4,1993,4.550279329608938
8726944,2,B013322WYS,"Poor microphone placement (at the foot of the stage) and mixing makes the sound feel recessed and slightly milky throughout, but particularly when singers are upstage or singing facing each other in duets. The whole point of a Blu-Ray opera production is the sound quality. We've all seen these operas a hundred times, and whether we have or have not, surely costumes, sets, blocking, and lighting are rather unimportant aspects of an opera production. The sound, the singing and playing, is what matters, and it is less than optimal here. A missed opportunity.  The bonus material is, however, useful precisely for this reason. You can cruise through the samples and judge how well (rarely) or poorly (more frequently) their sound is recorded before buying the next Blu-Ray.",1447200000,7,775,5.102362204724409
8726945,5,B013322WYS,"Absolutely ""Splended"" in every way.",1446768000,,35,6.2
8726946,5,B013322WYS,"Finally, a Cav/Pag I can love and view over and over again. I am still recovering from ""Bohemes"" starring tenors with slicked down hair achieved by the application of Walmart's entire weekly supply of gel. Tenors who outweigh the entire cast are a turn off for me. Yes, Pavarotti, etc. are the exceptions but when attention to size is amplified by lack of acting ability - I suffer as a viewer. This blu ray features a superlative cast that is masterfully directed and staged. As a professional theatre director of many decades, I am in awe of the attempt and success of these one acts. The acting ability (yes, operatic performers should know how to act as well as sing) of the entire company is most impressive. The use of minimal scenery while still maintaining the period 'feel' of the designs is also much appreciated. I am still recovering from being subjected to another Cav/Pag that presented a stage populated by black boxes of varying sizes and costumes that were similarly annoying and somber. Bravo and kudos for this blu ray; what an excellent intro to these two minor masterpieces for students as well as the more jaded.",1446595200,4,1134,4.732323232323233
