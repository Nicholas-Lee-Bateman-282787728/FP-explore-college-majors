1007027,4,6305262136,"The one consistent complaint I hear about Darkside Blues is that the plot is ""too confusing"".  Honestly, people, how do you even manage to tie your shoes in the morning?  I concede that it might be a little  confusing for some people, if the only plot development you usually have to  worry about is ""gee, i wonder why her clothes are exploding off her  body *this* time?"".  Puh. Lease.
Intellectual snob I may be, but I'm  as much of an imagery wh*re as the next person.. and Darkside Blues is  really pretty.  Well, okay: Darkside [the ""Dream Doctor"" (we  never learn his real name)] is really pretty.
Nice visuals and an  interesting story.",957484800,5,643,4.601769911504425
1007028,5,6305262136,"Darkside Blues is what you call an ""Underground Classic"".  It's a very complex story.  You have to pay attention to everything the characters say to really understand the plot(and I mean listen to  everything).  I really enjoyed this anime.  Most people agree that Darkside  Blues is what really dragged them head first into anime.  I really  recommend you buying it.  This is basically an anime for those  ""hard-core"" anime watchers.  Also a major plus, the graphics are  an absolute masterpiece.  This is not your typical anime.  If you are  looking for titles such as ""Oh! My Goddess"", or  ""SailorMoon"" flicks,  then this is DEFINITELY not the movie for  you.  But if you're looking for a real complex and unusual plot line, then  this is totally the anime for you.",955411200,10,768,4.8062015503875966
1007029,4,6305262136,"This anime remains apart from most in so much as it has an adult plot that combines the best elements of storytelling with brutal violence. The story is set in a Bladerunner environment with one Mega-corporation owning most  of Japan. There are small areas of rebellion known as the Darkside of  Tokyo. Far more interesting than this typical plot is the arrival of a  possibly supernatural stranger. To reveal more would spoil a well crafted  plot. The animation is exellent, the music suits the pace of the movie. The  dubbing is also good, and the overall quality of the anime is very high. A  manga recommended for fans of wicked city, vampire hunter 'D' or any horror  anime. Thus it makes an exellent purchase.",951782400,14,715,4.717741935483871
1007030,5,6305262136,"This is a very well done anime. Story pace is just right and keeps you rivited to the screen. The story takes place in, where else, futuristic Tokyo. At this time, most all of the city is controled by a  mega-corporation. But, there are a few 'free zones"" or pockets of  rebellion. This story takes place in one such part of Tokyo called Kabuki  Town, or the Darkside of Tokyo. The anime revolves around a small band of  rebels and a dark stranger who emerges from within via a cryptic looking  horse drawn carraige. It is a nice blend of sci-fi and mystic fantasy.  The  DVD version allows choice of language and subtitles. This is an excellent  anime. Well worth the price of admission.",946944000,25,688,4.491935483870968
1007103,4,6305262136,"In the future,  the Persona company owns 90% of the world's surface and rules what they own through a restrictive and violent tyranny.  One of the few bastions of freedom not owned by the Persona company is Shinjuku Tokyo,  The Darkside of Tokyo, the most dangerous place around, but also the one place with true freedom.  Few people stand up to the Persona tyranny, bands of rebel terrorists fight to destroy Persona and their main computer systems located on their space satellite home called Heaven.
Fortunes begin to change when a mysterious figure-a man riding with a coach and four horses-arrives from the fourth dimension.  Why is he here? And what is his message of renewal that he brings to the disparate characters of this saga?  He calls himself Darkside, and appears to be a strange mystic that somehow unites characters with a deeper part of themselves.
Then there is the single escaped terrorist who seeks haven in Shinjuku and dreams of a world free of control by the Persona corporation, Tatsuya.  His life and mission become tangled up with a band of misfit rebels in Shinjuku, lead by Mai-a street-smart blond woman with an inner core of steel she uses to protect herself from her past.  And he befriends Selia, a troubled woman who's family was lost to the tyranny of Persona.  Other characters abound, almost all of them allowing tantalizing glimpses of their lives, but never quite explaining what it all means.  These characters are never cute or whiny, maintaining a sense of gritty reality in a world gone wrong.
I quite enjoyed the story and the ideas presented, but for anyone who is looking to have the questions raised by the anime also answered may be disappointed.  By far the strongest element in this is the characters and their transformation through the story.  Selia and Mai especially dominate the scenes, unusually strong and self-sufficient women for an anime.  There is a bit of frontal nudity (a tortured prisoner) and some rather sadistic violence (of the same prisoner) for the first few minutes of the anime.  Beyond this, most of the violence is fairly tame, with some gun battles and several deaths, but not extremely visually graphic.  The plot never quite crystallizes the way I hoped.  The telling feels more like the opening of a complex story arc that never went any further.  The introduction of ""Darkside Blues"", performed by a street-player was a decidedly disconcerting addition.  The tune never quite fit the story for me.
The artistry is excellent.  Hedeyuki Kikuchi whose talents are also seen in WICKED CITY, DEMON CITY SHINJUKU, and VAMPIRE HUNTER D lends a dark, detailed and slightly gothic edged style to this futuristic anime.  The dub on this particular video is decent, although at times the translation feels a little too obscure, and I'm hopeful to find a subtitled version to compare.
Looking for a clear-cut story?  This probably isn't for you.  But if you're a viewer who likes the unusual side of anime and enjoys character development and the artistry of anime, I recommend you check out this particular anime.
Happy viewing!  Shanshad ^_^",1069113600,19,3111,4.906309751434034
1007104,1,6305262136,"This was, quite simply, the worst anime movie I ever sat down to watch. It's the worst one I've ever purchased, that's for sure. Blues singing (very, very bad blues singing) mixed with the old west in the middle of a futuristic city and a dark rider in a carriage... if done well it could have actually worked out quite nicely, the concept could have been interesting.  But this isn't well done. It's not even medium rare. It's road kill. It's just bad.
Since every other review has been good, I have to say: Sorry if you liked it and I've made you mad, but I really think it's crap. You can call me bad names and say I'm stupid if it'll make you feel better.",1068508800,7,659,4.23015873015873
1007105,4,6305262136,"For the firsat part, this movie was pretty good (hence the title). Sure there were random popups of characters but who cares, they die anyways (some in a totally cool battle scene) and also let me point out how much the female leader in the movie looks like releena from the gundam wing series (people whove watched it you kno wht i'm talking about*) For a movie that was made in 1994 the animation was pretty good but I have to say I wasn't to fond of the music even though it had a good honest beat but seriously I think it would have been used elswhere (the wrong scenes with the wrong music) but cheers to the old drunken guy who starts singing that just cracked me up. Another thing I want to point out is, did you ever notice how the guy who made this movie and lets say Ninja Scoll (yes i kno im comparing it with tht movie) always has a string of bad guys, meh thts just me but w/e.

1007107,5,6305262136,"this anime is a wonderful piece of work. it's dark and rather existential, and leaves you wondering, instead of with a sad or happy ending. it may not be to some people's taste, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes something a little off the beaten path.",1041120000,,273,4.48
1007108,4,6305262136,"When you read the title of this review you may wonder what that means exactly?  Well, first of all, the main (kinda') character...a gothic, dark, strange, quiet, ""Vampire Hunter D""-esque character named ""Darkside"".  He past is surrounded in mystery, and his powers are far above any other person's in the movie.  Throughout the whole story there are only a handful of hints leading to his past, but nothing is revealed.  The character development is pretty good, but some of the characters ""like Chris the Knife"" need a little more working-on for how big of charisma they had.
I can't really explain the movie in detail, but the jist of it is that a leading monopolizing corporation owns 90% of the planet.  A small town run by hoodlums, delinquents, and punks is all that is really left.  There are odd groups of ""freedom fighters"" that want to do away with the corporation.  There are also a few punks that get caught up in the rebellion's doings and they are thrown into the frey of things.  Its kinda' confusing at first, but when you watch you'll understand.
The movie in generally dark (in most scenes) but also has its fair share of light involved.  The hero Darkside has a strange voice in Japanese, but if you got used to Son Goku's voice from the Dragon Ball series then you'll most certainly get used to Darkside's.  The fighting (when there is some) is very well done.  I was surprised by this one scene where ""Chris the Knife"" reflects two small rockets back at the creature who fired them with just his knives!  That scene is quick but very cool.  But of course, you have to get used to the long, drawn-out talking scenes to develop the plot.
As far as content was concerned, I was very impressed by this movie.  There is fair amount of violence, but nothing too great as to gross anyone out.  As far as nudity in concerned, there is one scene at the beginning that has a woman being torture with her shirt off that may give you the wrong impression about the rest of the movie's content (there is some blood though).
To sum this up, Darkside Blues is an extremely mysterious gothic story about a would-be future with some super-natural people.  I would recommend this title to people who like Vampire Hunter D or Demon City Shinjuku (also by Hideyuki Kikuchi) or just people who enjoy a strange experience.",1021507200,,2321,4.597087378640777
1007109,5,6305262136,"Before I begin, I'll say that ""Darkside Blues"" was based off a manga (Japanese comics) series of the same name. After watching this movie, it's easy to see that it was made especially for fans of the manga. Still, just because you haven't read the manga doesn't mean you can't enjoy this movie. Just like ""Serial Experiments Lain"", however, you have to pay close attention.
At first glance, ""Darkside Blues"" might be considered a gothic horror film, especially since it's from the creator of ""Vampire Hunter D"" and ""Demon City Shinjuku"". But ""Darkside Blues"" is anything but a horror film. It's more like a drama...a very dark, modern-set, sci-fi drama.
The atmosphere is very moody and at times quite depressing. The characters, while not as fleshed out as they should be, are far from stereotypical. Surprisingly, the plot of ""Darkside Blues"" doesn't center directly around the title character, Darkside, although he does play a key role. To me, this is one of the more interesting ways a title character can be presented in a movie, and it works in this one.
One thing about ""Darkside Blues"" is that you have to pay attention, particularly with the dialogue. While people who have read the manga might understand this movie easily, people who haven't will have to watch every image and listen to every piece of dialogue to fully understand what's going on. And even then the viewer might not understand completely. Some major questions are left unanswered in this movie, and depending upon your tastes this might frustrate you. But if you're open to using your imagination, this movie will give you a field day.
And while I haven't heard the Japanese version of this movie, I have heard the English version, and it is surprisingly good. Not ""Princess Mononoke"" good or ""Cowboy Bebop"" good, but good nevertheless.
All in all, ""Darkside Blues"" is an interesting way to lose yourself within the realms of your own mind and soul. If you're ready to think your way through a movie, then go ahead a try out this anime.",1002153600,16,2015,4.826589595375722
1007110,2,6305262136,"Darkside Blues is thought-provoking and complex, but too disorganized to appeal to those who haven't read the original manga. Here's the run-down; Persona Century is an organization that owns 90% of the world, and wants the remaining 10. The city of Shinjuku, guarded by a resistance group known as the Messiah, happens to be part of that 10 percent. A mysterious man whose intelligence is incalculable and physical constitution unbreakable appears from nowhere and stops in Shinjuku. He has the ability to give people a treatment called 'renewal' that expels the darkness from within their souls.
Now, this premise sounds cool and all, but the actual story is a pretty bumpy ride. I like a movie that's wrapped up at least somewhat. Unfortunately for me, almost nothing is resolved between Persona and the Messiah at the end of the movie, making it really disappointing. It's not the grand-scale climax I had expected but rather a resolution at a personal level. A lot of the dialogue is, for the most part, just stupid. For instance, Messiah leader Mai sits in a park one night when suddenly a man she's never seen before darts through the park, followed by a stream of laser beams. The man falls over in front of Mai and is unconscious. The mutant that was firing at the man walks over to Mai and says ""do you have any business with this man?"" to which Mai replies ""nope"". Then the mutant asks ""is he a boyfriend?"". Where does a senseless question like that come from? She has nothing to do with the guy. This kind of dialogue makes the script seem slipshod and cheap.
The music is generally bad and even annoying at times. The theme song is sung in English with such a heavy accent that almost nothing is understandable. As for dubbing, it's good and bad. It seems that one of the voice actors literally plugged their nose when voicing one of the characters. On the good side, Darkside has the perfect voice. It's dark and enigmatic without trying too hard to be so. Plus, Darkside is just one of the coolest anime characters ever created. The anime is redeemed pretty much any time Darkside appears. After that, you know he's gonna do something cool. The best line in the entire anime is  ""why don't I do something for your cat?"", which Darkside spontaneously asks an elderly woman in his dark enigmatic voice. It's hard to make a sound decision about buying such an obscure anime before actually seeing it.",992995200,,2412,4.688679245283019

He utilizes ""dream therapy"" to open the hearts and numbed minds of those who will carry on the struggle to depose the all powerful Persona Century. It seems to me that this movie should be followed up by a series, because it leaves many questions unanswered. But that's my only complaint.

1007112,5,6305262136,"First off, let me say ONE word to describe this movie.  AMAZING!!  When I first decided to watch this movie I thought to myself that it looked pretty descent and I should give it a try.  Well, I'm glad that I did because this is quite possibly the best Anime I have ever seen.  The plot was very engrossing in that it had to deal with the supernatural in a ""goth"" sort of way.  It reminded me a lot of ""The Crow"" because of it's dark, vengful mood.  The animation is purely spectacular.  Great character and plot developement make this movie a must see.  If you've seen Vampire Hunter D and loved it as much as I did, then you will also fall in love this great work by the same creator!!  I was help captive throughout the story by Darkside's uncanny abilities to get the rest of the characters out of a pinch in just the nick of time.  The music in the film really sets the mood for what happens in each scene, if Darkside is in there tearin everybody to shreds, it's reall fast-paced.  Also, a really big is that the dubbing for this Anime is great.  That's so hard to find these days that when you actually do find it, you almost don't want to believe it.  This Anime is, overall, a great addition to any collection, or a great start.  Either way you will NOT be disappointed.",977961600,,1279,4.231404958677686

*Spoilers*

I don't know anything about the series that this movie is connected to, so take my review as an outsider's opinion, but I found ""Darkside Blues"" to be pleasantly experimental and intriguing.

One of the other reviews noted that this movie starts in the middle, ends in the middle, and resolves nothing, and I must confess that this is a fair assessment. There is zero explanation for why (or how) the Darkside character shows up the way he does, nor what his motivations are, nor - for that matter - much in the way of the backstory or motivations of *any* of the characters. Usually, I would absolutely hate that in a movie, but ""Darkside Blues"" gripped me so firmly with its independent style that I was happy to just be taken along for the ride.

There is so much to like about this movie. There are the strong heroines Mai and Selia, who manage to be both strong, independent, and realistically human - a rare combination. There is the fascinating fighting styles of Mai, Chris, Darkside, and actually pretty much everyone else in this movie, although fighting is definitely not the main focus of ""Darkside Blues"". There is the overlay of the mystical and the inner mind - for instance, coming directly to the room 'you intended to visit' when entering the mysterious and magical hotel - that reminds me strongly (and oddly, enough, given the name of the evil corporation) of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persona/dp/B00002SU93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persona</a>&nbsp;series.

""Darkside Blues"" is intriguing for the dark magical realism it conveys, almost akin to a Gabriel Marquez novel. The futuristic world and setting is real enough, but magical things occur with regularity and the seemingly 'normal' characters observe the magic with quiet acceptance, as though these things are, if not normal, then at least something that must simply be dealt with. Darkside, the character, appears out of nowhere and seems intent on psychically healing the residents of the slum in which he lands, but though he is noted as a threat by the main villains, he doesn't seem particularly interested in threatening them in any way. Instead, he seems to be a sort of catalyst, empowering the people around him to allow them to threaten Persona Company in the manners they prefer. And in the midst of all the magic and unexplained events, the viewer is invited to simply lie back and be swept away by the mystery, magic, and spectacle of it all.

It's hard to say whether or not I 'recommend' ""Darkside Blues"". Though I enjoyed it immensely, it's easy to recognize that many perfectly reasonable viewers will hate it. The apparent plot, revolving around Darkside's appearance and mission, never goes anywhere or experiences any resolution; and a secondary sub-plot involving the slum-residents and their terrorist activities is never really arresting enough to carry the film in the traditional manner. If you do chose to watch ""Darkside Blues"", I'd recommend doing so intending to just enjoy the dark, oppressive feel of the movie and the disorientation that accompanies the magical realism genre.

Avoid this like the plague.

This movie begins in the middle and ends in the middle, none of your questions will be answered, EVERYTHING is left up to interpretation, and the director/creator fails miserably at attempting to spark interest by revealing absolutely NOTHING and maintaining secrecy throughout the entire (if you must call it) ""FILM"".",1197158400,,366,5.293103448275862

A man dressed in all black inside a carriage driven by four horses returns a young boy fallen into a dimensional hole fleeing bullies who want to do him harm. The movie is mysterious and dark. The Persona company owns a large part of the world and there is a small percentage who are still free from its domain. The individuals are the low of the low with a few decent people who are trying to make the best of a bad situation.

7887236,4,6305262136,"This is an unusual anime feature, based on a manga which is largely unavailable in the US.  In its multifaceted story of resistance to the Persona Corporation which has come to own 90% of the world, it seems to take no viewpoint,  It follows the common Japanese story-telling convention of  bringing up the story as an intricate composition of story lines rather than one single driving thread.

Two things trigger the events in the film.  A young boy, Katari, flees some troublemakers and falls into a hole into another dimension.  Somehow he is rescued by a peculiar doctor driving a stagecoach who will remind you of Vampire Hunter D (Hideyuki Kikuchi did work there as well).  And a rebel raid successfully sabotages a Persona control center and only one of them, Tatsuya, successfully escapes and a pretty young gang leader, Mai, becomes involved in his rescue.

The Doctor, takes the name of Darkside after the the place he arrives - the Kabuki-Cho district of  Shinjuku Tokyo.  There he practices a form of 'medicine' called Renewal.  He touches many of the people in Shinjuku, especially Mai and Selia whose fate becomes entwined with Tatsuya's.  Darkside has some past with the family who owns Persona, and Renewal has something to do with enspiriting both Katari and Selia so that the opposition to the corporation can continue.

Guren and Tamaki, the owners of Persona are classic villains.  She is a sadist who get pleasure from turning people to gold when they are still alike, and he if the cold corporate master who thinks nothing of destroying a Himalayan mountain to kill a few rebels.  Thus each character casts a human and an archetypical shadow, and it is not always clear which you are seeing.

And there you have it, a cast of idiosyncratic characters enacting a set of woven storylines to reach an inevitable tragedy and a transcendent moment of hope.  All to the background of American blues music.  This may turn out to be one of those little known classics which you either hate or love, since it raises more questions than it could ever answer.  But it invites the viewer's introspection - what is the nature of opposition to oppression?  Are hatred and grief powers, or curses?",1123459200,5,2205,4.8138297872340425

The mystery of the characters, specially Darkside, is so intriguing. The fact that they don't tell you anything straighforward but instead leave you to figure out what the hell's going on, is fantastic! This is a very complex anime and if you're someone who got bored with ""the end of evangelion"" then probably you will think this anime stinks. I'm a sucker for weird and different things, so naturally I love this movie. The animation is old school, but it's still very, very good. A very disconcerting, yet perfectly fitting thing was the music sang by the old man with the guitar. At first I was like: What the hell?, but after a couple minutes it felt perfect for the scene, in fact the whole movie.

I can't complain too much about the animation and music score since it was done over a decade ago, but the character designs are horrible. They look like they are in the 1980s, not the future. I also found it very odd that Darkside, a dark being, came out from a mirror on a horse-drawn carriage. There are many quirky things in this movie I could go on and on about, but I'll get down to the main problem- the plot.

A gang fights against the dictator of the world with the help of a mysterious man named Darkside, cool right? Hardly. There appears to be no plot in the movie. Many scenes appear to have no purpose at all in expanding the plot or are unclear why they are happening. What makes things worse is most of these pointless scenes lack any good action; they just makes the plot more painfully quirky. This is probably because they are rushing through the plot, I guess.

While most of my friends who read the original manga say it was better, I prefer this version of the story - the quality of animation is quite appealing.
