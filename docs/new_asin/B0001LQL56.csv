8410259,5,B0001LQL56,"They say that a positive mental attitude can increase your odds of beating cancer. In this video four ordinary people tell their stories and how their attitudes helped them beat their illnesses. It was very helpful in my family,not just for the family member that has the serious illness.",1343692800,,288,4.8979591836734695
8410260,5,B0001LQL56,I found this a very interesting and inspiring DVD.  It is a little dated now - made in the 1980s - but everything in it is as relevant today as it was then.  A must for anyone who has recently been diagnosed with any type of cancer!,1253318400,3,232,3.9148936170212765
8410261,3,B0001LQL56,The genre of this tape is a bit out of date- although the stories are timeless. I expected more advanced digital work for the meditations to try. So I guess I was a bit disappointed overall. The content of Dr. Siegel's was very valuable despite the amateur videography. I probably wouldn't purchase it again.,1178928000,2,308,4.722222222222222
8410262,5,B0001LQL56,"This video presents real people giving their personal cancer stories. These folks are very different in ages and backgrounds, but they all shared a dire diagnosis and have lived to present their experience, strength and hope. Interspersed with this is Bernie giving his own powerful message of hope and he does it with love, humor, and as always with Bernie, MANY stories.  The second half about imagery and affirmations I found less helpful, but I've watched the first half a number of times.  It always perks me up since I am in the middle of my cancer journey and sometimes the slogging is very uphill.",1163030400,8,605,4.752380952380952
