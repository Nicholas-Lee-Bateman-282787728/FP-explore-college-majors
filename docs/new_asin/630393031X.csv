728125,5,630393031X,I've had this tape for a while and I really love it. The exersizes are effective and fun. I like to mix it up with shorter abs workouts; so I do Washboard abs about 2x a week and 10-minute tapes on other days.,960076800,,209,3.883720930232558
728126,1,630393031X,This is without a doubt the easiest video I have ever done.  I did it one time and then gave it to my mother.  The workout is far to simple for someone at even a low intermediate range.  I did the whole workout without  feeling a burn once.  I was in the low intermediate range when I bought  this video.  I recommend Kathy Ireland's Absolutely Fit for a better  quality and workout.,949363200,6,383,4.222222222222222
7855267,5,630393031X,"I bought a 2nd copy of this great tape because I gave mine this Spring to a dance student having back problems. The first thing to address with back pain is the abdominal muscles (and hers were flaccid).  If done correctly, I think this tape is good for almost anyone, and the instruction is truly pleasant.--even fun!  The best thing is that instructor Terri Walsh stresses the importance of hollowing the abdomen --making it feel as though it's coming out of the spine in back and KEEPING IT THERE. Working with partners, my students are amazed to find how much they have NOT been hollowing when performing crunches or sit ups.  Listening to Terri and following the workout is a great investment in a stronger back and better body.  Really helpful is the fact that the tape contains 3 separate, short workouts after a warm-up, so it's possible to work up to all 3 gradually.",1375142400,,876,4.632258064516129
7855268,4,630393031X,"I've always been a fan of Crunch workouts due to their crazy, fun environment; and after trying the more recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Fat-Burning-Ab-Attack/dp/B000A3XY8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch Fat Burning Ab Attack</a>, I really wanted to try another abdominal workout from this series.  When I saw that this VHS was from 1995, I was a little bit worried that its age might affect its intensity.  As it turns out, my worrying was completely in vain; while the VHS wasn't the most hardcore ab workout I've ever done, it also wasn't a walk in the park.  I really felt my entire abdominal region work while doing the workout and know that the exercises in this VHS are effective.

The majority of the workout is comprised of many variations of crunches.  However, the VHS is divided into three sections that progress in difficulty so that beginners can get just as good a workout as intermediates can.  These are the sections included:

Warm Up (7 minutes) - Terri Walsh (the instructor in this workout) gets you started by teaching you how to close your chest and involve your abs from a standing position.  She adds some circling arms, a few step touches, and some pulsing torso movements to gets your entire body warmed up and ready to work!

First Section (5 minutes) - This is the most basic of all the workouts.  Beginners will learn the proper way to do a crunch on the floor, and intermediate/advanced exercisers will reinforce good technique and start to burn the abs.  The moves included in this section are the following: basic crunches (slow), pulsing crunches (slow), twisting crunches, and reverse crunches.

Second Section (6 minutes) - You continue to build on the moves you've already done and really kick the workout into high gear.  This was probably the segment that I felt the most.  It's not particularly challenging, but Terri does enough reps that push you out of your comfort zone and really make you work.  Moves included: basic crunches (slow and fast) with one extended leg, a reverse crunch with a knee pulled to chest, and crunches with one leg stacked on the other.

Third Section (6 minutes) - I didn't think this section was any rougher than the previous one, but I still really liked it.  I still felt a burn in my abs and learned a few moves that I'd never seen before.  In this segment you will do the following: twisting crunches with knees to chest and a hip lift, crunches with one leg straight in the air and the other one bent, and a move on all fours where you tighten your abs so much that your knees lift off the floor.

Cooldown (3 minutes) - You finally get to relax your abs as you do some back stretches and twisting.  You also do some deep breathing and side stretches.  I wish there had been some abdominal stretching, but it's still a relaxing way to end a workout.

I really enjoyed having Terri as an instructor; I thought she was very pleasant, and it really seemed like she was a friend you were working out with instead of a plastic barbie doll instructor that can be found in many workout videos today.  Also, Terri really stresses good technique very frequently during the entirety of this workout, and advanced ab exercisers may get a bit sick of hearing her reminders to pull your navel to your spine.  Those who are advanced may also find that the workout isn't as long or intense as they would like.  Having another 5-6 minutes section or making the third section a little bit tougher would have fixed this.  For that reason, I'm only going to recommend this VHS to beginners and intermediates OR advanced exercisers who want a light workout or want to do the workout twice through.  I personally had a blast with this VHS (I'm an high intermediate/low advanced exerciser) and am definitely going to be checking out more Crunch workouts from the 90s.  They may be old, but that doesn't make them any less effective or fun!",1328313600,,3952,4.780559646539028

7855273,5,630393031X,"I am a fitness instructor, teaching kickboxing, Cycling and Step.  I work my abs every day and have a hard time feeling my ab workout the next day.  I actually bought this tape about a year ago and just hadn't had time to use it.  Recently, I have incorporated it into my workout routine and absolutely love it.  The moves are basic, but if you focus on how the instructor tells you to perform the move, you will really see results.  I like the fact that she keeps reinforcing ""navel into the spine.""  That makes all the difference in the world. If you use proper form, you will definitely see results.  I have really seen a difference in the ""definition"" in my abs and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in getting those ""Washboard Abs.""",1022112000,16,750,4.470588235294118
7855274,4,630393031X,"The warmup is a little hard to follow, but the actual abdominal section works wonders.  If it has been a while since you've done abs, you'll definitely be sore the next day.  This is also an excellent tape to do if you want to maintain the definition you might already have.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it lacks lower abdominal work.  There is one section but it is very short.  Overall, it is still one of my favorite tapes that I do every weeknight!  :>",1011571200,,463,4.204545454545454
7855275,2,630393031X,"This video is not very user friendly. If you're used to the stylings of Jane Fonda, you won't love this video. There isn't much cardio and the beginning warm up is very hard to follow. I recommend doing 20 minutes of cardio before doing the exercises in this video. The video alone won't leave you feeling very tired. The ab exercises are great, but without any cardio they won't get you very far. There are cheesy sayings between each section and the video doesn't tell you when you need to get a mat like Jane does. Personally, I would stick with Jane Fonda's abs and thighs videos. I can't speak for what kind of results you get using one versus the other, but Jane's videos give you a great workout and are much easier to follow.",995068800,,733,4.397058823529412
