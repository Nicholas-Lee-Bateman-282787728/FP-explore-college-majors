7822097,5,6302091500,"Most ballet lovers may have never watched or even heard of this work by Richard Strauss, of which there only exists this 1977 version.  Kevin Haigen, only 23 at the  time, exhibits both an uncannily androginous beauty and a dancing prowess of the first degree as the protagonist.  Franz Musil is his equally beautiful and skilled guardian angel.  Legendary Judith Jamison and Heinrich Hollreiser complete the stellar cast of principals. Produced by another ballet legend, John Neumeir.  Visual poetry in motion, the production astonishes for its erotic intensity (you determine which kind). I actually just added to my permanent DVD collection.  By the way Haigen went on to  quite a distinguished career as a choreographer and stage director, and is still with the Neumeir Hamburg Ballet as part of its staff.",1370736000,,810,5.137404580152672
7822098,5,6302091500,"I drafted this review just after having finished viewing ""Josephs Legende"" (music by Richard Strauss), the ballet, as the great John Neumeyer choreographed the work, altering it somewhat from its original 1914 conception. Kevin Haigen appears in the title role and, let me tell the world, HE IS FABULOUS, a wonderful dancer already at this point in his career (1977) and physically of achingly youthful male loveliness, all the more so as his body is stripped to a mere loincloth, revealing his superb physique. The video is exceedingly well filmed, one that expertly captures the stage view, whether, variously, up-close or recessed, delivering what a dance-minded viewer wants and needs most to see, and the audio aspect satisfies, too, the great orchestra`s playing luxurious and vivid (the conductor, Heinrich Hollreiser, being very experienced as a conductor of Strauss` music), captured in good sound. The DVD of this performance (Deutsche Grammophon 00440-073-4315) is extraordinary and any lover of classical ballet ought to obtain it or its VHS equivalent (or at least to find a way to watch either), though for now (end of 2011) the VHS tape costs half of what the DVD does. Get the DVD or the VHS tape at whatever price you can afford! Since I. Taylor already has written perceptively of this filmed ballet, in his user`s review of the DVD for Amazon`s U.K. sister WWW site, my comments here are brief (and confirmatory).

Musicologists long have tended to denigrate Strauss` music in this particular score, but it works with wonderful immediacy as a balletic theatre piece and, in context, is lushly gorgeous and drammatically apt. I wanted, without delay, on first viewing, to watch the DVD over and over again, which is not hard to do, given that the ballet is fairly brief. John Neumeyer`s choreography is quite beautiful and interestingly inventive, potently erotic in an headily pansexual manner, a wonderful vehicle for Kevin Haigen`s immense talent as well as for the other dance soloists, of whom Franz Wilhelm, as Potiphar, is particularly fine. Otain the DVD or the VHS tape without further delay; either will be one to cherish and to view many times over!",1325116800,,2178,5.05
