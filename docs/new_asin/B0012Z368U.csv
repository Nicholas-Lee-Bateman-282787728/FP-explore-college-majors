3101206,3,B0012Z368U,"To counter a few other reviews I've read, I must say if you enjoy Italian cinema at all, you will probably like this, or at least find it wierdly fascinating.  The print from Severin films is in pretty good shape, and the DVD has some entertaining extras.  Forget this being a sexy movie -- the unrated version, after all, has some kind of random hardcore footage done by none of the actors here, but instead enjoy the sets made of aluminum foil and whatever else they managed to cobble together on a budget.  This movie won't win awards for anything, it's true, but it's at least worth a look.  Personally I find the bizarre plot more interesting than those of some of the current absurd sci fi movies that are lauded for the virtue of their ""special effects.""",1276905600,3,761,4.492753623188406

I am a completist so I felt the need to own it, but it lacks most of those things one looks for in a cult film.

3101211,3,B0012Z368U,"I had seen ""The Beast"" ( La Bete') and decided to give this a try. I actually liked the original as it had a good story. This one has a story, but it is somewhat flimsy.

3101212,3,B0012Z368U,"Severin's release of The Beast in Space was remarkable in that they found the only complete print in a basement of a condemned porno theater outside Bologna. So here it is, the first time ever this is presented on DVD anywhere in the world. With that special presentation, what are you exactly in for?

Without stating the obvious, the film is a mess. But thats where the fun begins. There is no real telling of what is happening, but one might surmise some of the possibilities. Ultimately this film is riding the coattails of two other films: The Beast (La Bete) and Star Wars. How you might imagine to combine these two films into one heap of psuedo-science-fiction with a touch of pornography? Its not easy, and watching this is not very easy either.

The film is basically about Captain Larry (Vassili Karis) who, after beating up his enemy and having hot sex, discovers the mysterious energy force called Antalium, which is, evidently is a sexual energy. He sets up his team complete with Sirpa Lane (from the original La Bete) who all go to a planet to get more of this stuff. There they meet strange things, like horses having sex, cardboard aliens, phony light-sabers and a ugly bearded man who controls it all. After they partake in a dinner, an orgy starts to emerge and soon everyone is having a great time. The big hairy man we soon finds out is a Satyr and he is ready to put out, specifically to Sirpa.

There are hardcore scenes in this version, but its really not erotic or sexually interesting. While the film is already cut-up to an incomprehensible mess, the hardcore footage does not help matters much either. Severin also released a standard unrated version sans the hard scenes if that is not your bag.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beast-in-Space-Unrated-Version/dp/B0012Z368U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beast in Space (Unrated Version)</a>

But this film is not meant to be high art. The best way to enjoy such a film is with your friends laughing at it over some drinks and whatever else that may help. Cause you will need help after you see this.

My 3 stars is not a recommendation (in fact I really would not recommend it to anyone) nor is it on the quality of the film itself. But that its a lost film that has come to us again and it looks very good, all things considered. My rating is also simply that its a fun movie and should be taken as such. I love Severin's releases and look forward to them bringing out these dingy films from beneath the surface so new audiences can know about them as they only add to the culture and history of film.",1218153600,36,2623,4.743421052631579
3101213,1,B0012Z368U,"Where to begin? How horribly can a concept be systematically destroyed?

This movie came out in 1978 or 1980, depending on where you look (the case says '80, but online sources say '78). Either way, the special effects are straight out of the 1940's. There are low budgets, and there are no budgets. Didn't these guys learn ANYTHING from Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey, or other 60's-70's sci-fi? Even with a barely-there budget things could have been much better.

But let's get to the real appeal of this movie, the schlocky sex and the promise of our heroine getting ""yet another graphic ravaging by a hugely-endowed man-beast."" Total letdown. As a huge fan of the crazy, I-can't-believe-they-actually-did-that, full-frontal of the creature, semen-soaked monster scenes from The Beast (La bte), this promise of a follow-up fell completely flat. Our ""hugely-endowed man-beast"" is a bearded old man with hooved faun's legs. The faun statue in the dining hall was more erotic.

There's no ""equipment"" on display, even in this unrated version, so you get no creature eye candy as you definitely did in The Beast. All you get is some above and to-the-side views of him doing her missionary style. Oh, and the furry legs are very, very obviously nylons with some thin, curly fur stuck on. What a total letdown.  I just noticed there is an X-rated version offered.  I don't know if that one is any more graphic but (1) I'm not going to pay again to find out and (2) our bearded old ""man-beast"" is hardly sexy anyway, so seeing more of his equipment wouldn't do anything for me anyway.

I could also go on and on about the terrible plot holes and the totally baffling horse mating scene. How did horses get on this far-off, unexplored planet? The scene is shown in a grainy, funhouse mirror effect that I assume is meant to invoke a mysterious atmosphere, but completely fails. And did we really need a blatant ripoff of light sabers while they were fighting the amazingly incompetent robot guards?

If you're hoping for anything like The Beast (La bte), prepare to be utterly disappointed. If you're simply expecting a cheesy, sexy bad-but-fun B movie diversion, you'll still be disappointed. This was just awful in every respect.",1215648000,11,2228,4.847368421052631
3101214,2,B0012Z368U,"I had the regular version (without hardcore inserts/sex scenes, without nudity).

The acting is stale and the script was just a below average Italian Horror ""spaghetti sci-fi"" script, nothing special. The first part scarcely grabbed my attention but it failed to keep it throughout the film. The only way I could recommend this movie, is if you really enjoy average/bad 80's Italian Horror/sci-fi.  I just lost any care about what happened.

I can't imagine what Alfonso Brescia must have been thinking with this film.  Perhaps this film would have been fun if it was SUPPOSED to be bad, but I'm pretty sure this was intended as serious genre entertainment.  I am an adoring fan of Italian Horror/sci-fi, but the only thing that went through my mind while viewing this film was, ""Oh hell, is it going to be over soon?"".

Being a genre fan, I've learned long ago to be able to overlook occasional silliness and nonsensical plot threads, but I just couldn't handle this mess.  You can't like them all, I guess. ""Angry Red Planet"" was great. ""Rocket Ship XM"" was great.  But I really did not like this movie.

Still, barely worth watching for the dumb look and some truly goofy dialogue, as well as a few twisted scenes.",1211328000,4,1217,4.729857819905213
