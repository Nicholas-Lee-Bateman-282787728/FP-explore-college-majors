8298197,5,B001EHKVKM,"Ride Like a Pro is produced by Jerry ""Motorman"" Palladino, a veteran Police Motorcycle Officer who runs classes in Florida teaching the techniques that are used by motor officers worldwide. Classes are also run in many locations around the US and you will see the Ride Like a Pro team do demonstrations at many events around the country.

This dvd takes through all of the necessary techniques required to master low speed handling. Correct use of the friction zone, throttle and brake are covered in detail and the RLAP team demonstrates all of these exercises on a variety of motorcycles.

This will be the most valuable resource in your collection and there is none better.

I highly recommend this dvd as a must have for any motorcycle rider.",1348185600,,746,4.8125
