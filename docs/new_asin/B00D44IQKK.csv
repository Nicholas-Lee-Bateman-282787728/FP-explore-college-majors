5773386,4,B00D44IQKK,"Just watched the English dub of This boy caught a merman, Shima's English voice was really good captured the lonely nature of the character perfectly but the voice for Isaki I didn't like as much as I did in the Japanese audio still it's one of the best boys loves dubs I've heard there was no cringe worthy voices like in Gravitation.

Though I must admit I do have one complaint though it goes more towards the packaging and not the anime itself. The case for the dvd is very flimsy and on arrival the dvd was not in place though not damaged and I have noticed that it does come lose while sitting in the case.",1392163200,6,612,4.230769230769231
5773387,5,B00D44IQKK,"Although this was a short video, I definitely loved it!
If you like the Junjou romantica series- this is similar to that in means of story type, but with a more speedy, non-sex filled plot line and a Gankutsuou-ish coloring scheme. I also have to be honest and say that I did in fact squeal during a couple of parts- Something I don't really do too often.

All in all, I thought it was pretty good! :)",1392076800,,401,4.207792207792208
5773388,4,B00D44IQKK,it's such a cute anime but the graphics are trippy and I wish it lasted longer but its such a cute anime.,1390262400,,105,3.8181818181818183
5773389,3,B00D44IQKK,"I hate to say it, but I didn't do my research when it came buying this DVD, and this is my reaction to opening it and watching the OVA.
So, first off, I was a little disappointed at the fact that I spent over $10 on a 30 minute OVA (I don't know if this is a fair price or not, I don't buy DVDs, I stick to books). I had expected it to be a movie or something for at least an hour and a half, and here I end up with a quick video with no series behind it, either book nor other animations.
The video itself had a unique art style that made it hard to follow at times, mainly the issue of text on the screen outside of the subtitles at the bottom. And things move pretty quickly, which is to be expected from a 30 minute OVA. But it's cute,and fairly cliche if I must admit, making it either ok to swallow or completely sick. ((As a side note, the OVA is very tame with only a kiss or two between the main characters.))
Personally, I enjoyed it. I don't mind stuff like that, It's a short and sweet story that starts in sadness and ends in happiness, the usual. But I would suggest trying to watch it online first (if possible), before deciding if this DVD is really worth buying firsthand without any knowledge behind it (like I did). Again, it's all a matter of taste.",1390176000,,1269,4.0396825396825395
5773390,5,B00D44IQKK,"This Boy Caught a Merman is a short movie about a high school boy named Shima. When jumping into the ocean after  dropping a picture of his late grandfather he is saved by a merman after nearly drowning. The merman (Isaki) agrees to stay with Shima and thus the bond between Isaki and Shima blooms.

 Will Shima be able to show his true self  to Isaki or will he remain a prisoner of self loathing. Although the story moves a bit fast it is a moving piece that is well worth the price. Which is quite reasonable. The art is simple but very beautiful and pleasant to the eye. I personally cried throughout the entire film. It would be a shame
 not to buy this film.",1386288000,,664,4.238095238095238
5773391,3,B00D44IQKK,"Okay, so just a warning, while it's an okay story, this is literally the weirdest thing you will ever see, I guarantee it. Aside from the oddness, the story is pretty eh, the main character is a mopey and kind of whiny boy, but I find the merman to be pretty funny and add a very welcome comedic aspect to the story. I also found it to be rather short. It's only about a half hour, and seems more like it should be an episode rather than a stand-alone piece. If you can get it for a couple bucks and enjoy shonen-ai, it might be worth buying, but to me it's just eh.",1386028800,,566,4.017699115044247
5773392,2,B00D44IQKK,I give it a five for color and style but the cheesy and cheap acting and sometimes its like an old kungfu movie were the words come late....very late. I think the creator wants it too be so funny and sweet that it gets lame and obvious. The characters are cute but I have to mute the crying...I can only take so much overly dramatic acting. Its 30mins seems shorter. It rushes. I just don't know man....I really don't.,1385942400,,418,4.30379746835443
5773393,3,B00D44IQKK,The story was cute but the whole anime/movie was trippy. The art was also iffy on occasion. It's definitely an aquired taste.,1385942400,,125,4.7272727272727275
5773394,4,B00D44IQKK,"Firstly, I knew it was just an OVA, but I expected it to be more than just one episode.  I felt that they could have stretched the story out a little farther.
Secondly, I liked the art style.  It reminded me a little bit of the Gankutsuo anime.  The colors and the way the characters were drawn was appealing to me.
On a plot and character note, I thought that the characters were fun and interesting, but again, I would've liked a little more time to get to know them.
On the whole, this anime felt a lot like a first date.  Fun and interesting, but not quite in love yet.",1381536000,14,573,4.135135135135135
5773395,5,B00D44IQKK,Not much else to say. This is a sweet somewhat melancholic love story. I think any fan of BL will generally be happy with this purchase. The art style is very different but likable. Give it a shot.,1380067200,2,197,4.2105263157894735
5773408,2,B00D44IQKK,"Not worth the time to watch, although the backgrounds were beautiful.",1441324800,,69,5.363636363636363
5773409,5,B00D44IQKK,"This film is a delightful little addition to my movie collection. The characters have depth and a lot of emotion behind them. The animation style is unique and is like a breath of fresh air with how different it is. Its style perfect for this little story, and it pulls off the comedic and heartfelt parts of the short film very well.
The film was delivered to me right on the day that it was supposed to and at an earlier time than expected, which pleased me, and the disc is beautiful, clean, and scratch free. The movie was read by my DVD player without issue, and it played perfectly.",1437609600,,588,4.3545454545454545
5773410,5,B00D44IQKK,"To begin with, this a shounen ai serious. Boys will fall in love with each other.

This OVA, like the others from the Kono Danshi series, has a very unique and beautiful animation style. Sure, it's kind of obvious that the budget here wasn't a lot but they made the very best of the budget and the animation is exceptionally unique.

The story was touching and even though it was only one episode I didn't find it to be rushed at all. Both main characters are lovable and have stayed with me for a very long time. Certainly one of my favorite shounen ai OVAs.",1431216000,,559,4.314285714285714

5773414,5,B00D44IQKK,"Excellent and emotional story. Thought it was good with its story of getting over the loss of someone close, and then eventually the thinking of the loss of losing a friend. The loneliness part of the story was really emotional too, even living with someone can lead to loneliness when both don't talk to each other and see each other so little eventually.

Liked how improved it was over This Boy Can Fight Aliens in terms of visuals, and the kiss and closeness was great. Why do all the good BL have to be so short.

I did wish there were also shorts on this one, to make the cost for 30minutes of anime on this BD feel a bit more bearable.

Good dub and good JPN cast, one of the best voice acting singers renders a song too so it was good",1421712000,,742,4.174825174825175
5773415,4,B00D44IQKK,this is a good movie I just wish it was longer than 30 minutes,1418601600,,62,3.5
5773416,1,B00D44IQKK,"Was not expecting this to be AMAZING, great, or even pretty goood, but decent/okay enough that I did not feel upset I wasted my money on. Which is how I feel. And extremely disappointed.",1416873600,,186,4.5

5773428,4,B00D44IQKK,"I stumbled across this here OVA online and watched it because I love merfolk, and I love yaoi.  I really liked it and I'm planning on purchasing it.  The art is beautiful and resembles watercolors and oceans, which is ironic because one of the main characters is a merman.  I saw the subtitled version and it was good, I'm looking forward to seeing the dub.  The animation is weak, though.  It's apparent that it has a low budget, but somehow with the pretty art, it isn't as hard on the eyes as some OVAs I've seen before.  That aside, it's a cute little episode.  I wish it would've been a twelve episode series, but regardless, it's worth checking out if you're a boys' love fan.",1411689600,,682,4.408
5773429,5,B00D44IQKK,A very romantic and heart-felt story that teaches us to accept others for who they are. I love absolutely it!!!,1404345600,,111,4.6
5773430,3,B00D44IQKK,"I picked this up with a higher expectation (not super high), unfortunately it fell short. It's a low budget anime, with its stiff movement comparable to South Park. It had a short cute plot that only lasted for 30 minutes (ova); it could have used more. It can't be considered MA or unrated you can put a rating of 13 and older on it and that is pushing it. There is barely any love interaction with the characters (kissing, hugging, etc). This is defiantly for a younger crowd. If you like Shonen ai then your good to go if you're looking for anything that is a true yaoi (with ""scenes"") move on.",1404172800,5,597,4.339285714285714
5773431,3,B00D44IQKK,It was a good little show. Wish there was more to it.,1404086400,,53,3.5
5773432,4,B00D44IQKK,"This short little anime is very touching and sweet. It clearly did not have any real budget to speak of, but used what they did have to create something with an interesting style all its own. I dearly wish it had been longer, though the story does not NEED to be. It is better, I suppose, to want more than to be complaining that it dragged on and on. Do I wish it had been longer? Absolutely. I really enjoyed the time I did get to spend with these characters, and watching their relationship. But did it NEED to be, to fully complete the story and its ideas of love and loss in a believable way? No. It's still a beautiful story that is worth your time, and who knows; maybe more scenes would have ruined it.",1403481600,,710,4.189781021897811
5773433,5,B00D44IQKK,"This dvd ha meet with all of my expectations, such as the time period it took for it to get sent out, as well as the quality of the video and of the casing it was sent in.

I would recommend this to anyone that is after a cute short story to watch and to fall in  love with :)",1402963200,,276,3.5833333333333335
5773434,5,B00D44IQKK,Im a true Yaoi fan I watched it and enjoyed it so much it was heart touching and very romantic boy+boy it made me say aaaaaaw and smile it is a really great movie I loved it. I plan on watching it with my Boyfriend whenever he comes to me or hangs with me well sit down and be sure to watch this awesome of a movie Yaoi. Yaoi fever forever if your a true Yaoi fan GET THIS NOW! it's worth your money if your gay hun. :D,1397001600,5,419,3.7191011235955056
5773435,1,B00D44IQKK,"I'm in the process of returning this DVD.  I didn't expect much...maybe a fluffy/silly romantic story...but this didn't even deliver this! First, for it to be a BL romance it had only 2 chaste kiss scenes.  I don't always expect to see sex, but at least some type of romantic/playful interaction (trust me there was almost zero!) This was no doubt due to the fact that the merman spent almost the entire length of the movie in the small kiddie pool while the boy (his love interest) was away at school complaining about being lonely!!  Go figure!! Secondly, for two people living together, there was very little interaction of any kind between the two ""lovers.""
Like I said I didn't expect too much but in any movie of this sort I expect the two characters to be in the same room/space some of the time and have some amusing dialog and interaction.  I've seen hotter Disney movies, which is preety sad!!!!",1396569600,5,905,4.60248447204969
5773436,5,B00D44IQKK,"I watched this movie at Otakon 20 and ordered this as a gift for my friend. She loves and it really is very cute and adorable. The relationship builds so beautifully. Also, this movie is definitely shonen ai and not yaoi. In other words, it is very PG. The worst thing about it is that it is only 30 minutes and you feel like your just beginning when it ends but that's how it is. Will definitely be re-watching.",1395446400,,412,4.227848101265823
5773437,4,B00D44IQKK,"This is a very cute story. There is no explicit yaoi, but it is a cute story. I only have issue with the type of animation. I am not fond of the style, but the story made it worth it.",1395187200,,183,3.6

8589349,5,B00D44IQKK,This is a very sweet m/m love story.  I like how the young man comes to understand himself better and his motives and I like how their relationship develops over the course of the story and the fact that it does not devolve into smut so that I can share this lovely gem with my teenaged grandchildren.  :),1472947200,,305,4.241379310344827
8589350,3,B00D44IQKK,"It was short and cute, but like other reviews it was definitely a budget production. It was very dramatic but the nearly storyboard like animation really made my sister and I giggle and kind of detracted from the story. That being said, it was very pretty. It reminded me of the animation used in the Count of Monte Cristo, but like a college art project version. Worth watching and I'll keep it to giggle at with my other sisters but keep in mind this isn't exactly a Miyazaki production.",1471651200,,489,4.50561797752809
8589351,3,B00D44IQKK,"For a 30-45 minute short film it's not bad, but it's not good either. I felt like the storyline was rushed and not fully developed.",1463443200,,131,4.28

8589354,2,B00D44IQKK,"They call it rated R or TV MA, but it is not even close to being rated Mature. Maybe a few suggestive things happened, but that would be TV 14 or PG-13. Nothing really sexual happens in this movie at all. It did have a cute story line though, but it should have been longer than 30 minutes. Don't watch it in English, I don't think the voice actors had the right tones for the characters. It's better watching it in Japanese with the English subs.",1455580800,3,447,4.209302325581396
8589355,5,B00D44IQKK,"I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who loves Yaoi. It was so cute, and the animation was so different from most animes, completely beautiful.",1450828800,,153,4.923076923076923
