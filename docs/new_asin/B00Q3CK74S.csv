8690143,5,B00Q3CK74S,"Very well done documentary. It focuses on tormas for a Kagyu festival, but the information is applicable to tormas in general. Good production values, great information. Surprisingly well done for a small budget documentary. I really enjoyed it and highly recommend for people interested in Tibetan Buddhism. Probably 4 star, but give the scarce amount of material available on the subject I gave it a 5. Highly recommend.",1527724800,,422,5.220588235294118
8690144,5,B00Q3CK74S,"Never before have I seen any book or teaching as clear and understandable as this DVD...Not only that, but it has footage of many of the greatest masters in the world of Torma! And some of these Masters will never be seen again.
If you are new to the topic this DVD will teach you the secret aspect of The ancient practice of Torma.
if you are well seasoned in the dharma you will cherish this DVD for its genuine accuracy into the usage of Torma.",1452038400,,447,4.209302325581396
8690145,5,B00Q3CK74S,"This terrific movie fills a need for westerners who practice or are attracted to Tibetan Buddhism. Often, we don't fully understanding the significance of the many rituals and practices.  Although they can be seductive, the practices offer no lasting benefits unless we understand them.  This movie explains the beautiful ritual of offering tormas, a form of generosity practice.  In recent years, His Holiness Karmapa, the head of the Karma Kagyu lineage, has inspired a revival in torma sculpture. This wonderful art form is explored and explained through interviews, close-up documentation of the artists, and amazing footage of the butter sculptures.  One can then mentally offer similar tormas in one's own practice, or perhaps be inspired to learn to make some. Highly recommended.",1451606400,,787,5.426229508196721
8690146,5,B00Q3CK74S,"This movie goes back and investigates the origins of the Tormas, Tibetan butter sculpture. It is fascinating and has interviews with many high masters of the Kagyu Linage, including the 17th Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje.
For overseas customers, I would recommend ordering directly from http://www.namsebangdzo.com, for customs reasons. I am thrilled that I was able to purchase this movie, and on top of the movie itself there is a lot of great stuff in the bonus features. I can recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in religious practices.",1441065600,3,554,5.0989010989010985
