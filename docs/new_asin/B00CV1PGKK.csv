5742134,5,B00CV1PGKK,"Enjoyed this movie very much  Great cast includes Rory Calhoun who is great in every one of his movies, Corinne Calvet, they don't make them like her anymore, beautiful and talented and the always wonderful Cameron Mitchell. Interesting storyline well told, well acted.  I was pleasantly surprised at the good quality of this dvd.",1372204800,16,330,5.092592592592593
5742135,4,B00CV1PGKK,"The print is excellent with great Technicolor. This is a very entertaining western with some good twists. Rory Calhoun is excellent and Corinne Calvet adds her French touch. There's the typical good guys, bad guys with an unusual ending for the bad guy. Not bad at all.",1369958400,13,269,4.74468085106383

5742141,5,B00CV1PGKK,If ya like westerns you'll enjoy watching this movie with Rory he is one of my all time actors back in his days. The acting is good and just the right amount of action. I've always enjoyed watching Cameron Mitchell which is a good actor whether he plays the good guy or the bad guy. I'll watch it over again.,1396915200,,308,4.15
5742142,2,B00CV1PGKK,Am only 10 minutes in on this movie and the picture quality is very poor. I'm watching on a 1080p DVD. Movie looks good so far. Have just finished the movie and while the plot was good the DVD is simply the quality of videotape and the movie hasn't been restored. Probably not worth purchasing when all is said and done.,1388016000,2,320,4.262295081967213
5742143,5,B00CV1PGKK,"""Powder River"" is one of my favorite westerns, period.  Rory Calhoun gives his typical ""cool"" performance while Cameron Mitchell chews up in the scenery in one of his over the top but enjoyable performances of a villain with a brain tumor.  If this were starring Joan Crawford and Barbara Stanwyck it would have been viewed as delicious camp...but in the hands of the male leads it a fun western ""soaper"".  Calvert is on hand to add a little flair as the feisty saloon owner with a heart of gold.  The DVD is a decent transfer...which I suspect is the same as  Spanish import I once owned.  Its in its original aspect ration of 4:3.  No magic restoration was done here...but it has enough eye candy to make you really not care.  Clocking in at under 80 minutes, its a great weekend watch.",1387929600,3,788,4.5
5742144,5,B00CV1PGKK,"I saw this at the cinema when I was a boy and had fond memories of this film. Was happy to see it released on dvd and upon watching it again was not disappointed. The movie still holds up today as an enjoyable western. Great seeing the supporting cast made up with actors like Robert Wilke, John Dehner, Carl Betz, Frank Ferguson, Raymond Greenleaf, Zon Murray & Ethan Laidlaw. The stars shone in their roles as well (Rory Calhoun, Cameron Mitchell, Corrine Calvet & Penny Edwards. A fine story loosely based on the Stuart Lake Wyatt Earp story but different enough to not be recognized as such except a couple of instances. Very happy to have it in my collection and will be one I will watch again on occasion.",1379030400,9,711,4.476923076923077

8586668,5,B00CV1PGKK,"I'm a huge fan of Rory Calhoun and I was rather pleasantly surprised with this movie. I did not pay $20, which I think is too steep for a movie, even if it does have one of my favorite stars in it! I was well worth the $13 I spent and the story was much more than the typical shoot-em-up western. And the actors played their parts well.
 Any movie that I have seen so far with Rory Calhoun is great, but this one was really good! I highly recommend it!!!",1437523200,,454,3.989010989010989

8586670,5,B00CV1PGKK,"I really enjoy Rory Calhoun westerns! I actually just recently 'discovered' his movies, so I'm not in a place to judge 'Powder River' against any of his other movies - but after seeing this, I've ordered several more Rory westerns, so that speaks for itself!",1425340800,,258,4.7555555555555555
