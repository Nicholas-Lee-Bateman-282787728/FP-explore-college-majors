2163249,3,B00062IESM,"Too outdated.  A simple movie that is just like way too many others of it's day.  No surprises in this one, stilted acting, and predictable dialogue.",1370649600,,149,4.6923076923076925
2163250,3,B00062IESM,"Jodi Seronick had bad lines and direction but still managed to pull off a decent performance, Hoke Howell (Professor) and Charles Narier (Sheriff) did their best but I felt they were placed in the wrong roles. As for the movie it sucked and was a waste of time. I normally don't care if a movie has T&A but in this case I think it would have at least helped keep my interest. So watch with friends so you can at least laugh at how bad it is.",1355616000,4,441,4.080459770114943
2163251,4,B00062IESM,"A friend of mine whom I worked with about five years ago was the Director of Photography of ""Alien Species"", and had given me a copy of the movie.  As producer of an independent movie myself (http://www.amazon.com/Muffin-Man-HD-Mike-Short/dp/B00065Y82U) I was very intrigued and wanted to see it, but for some reason the DVD ended up on a shelf and I never got around to watching it until this week.

This isn't the movie genre that I usually go out of my way for, but it was actually quite enjoyable.  Sure, it's a low budget production of a story that's been re-hashed a thousand times (aliens come to earth and shoot up the place for no discernable reason), but technically it was very well done.  The acting was fine, the dialog was passable, the special effects were actually quite good - especially considering the shoe-string budget that this movie was obviously made on. The biggest issue I had was that the overall plot just didn't really go anywhere.

If you're a connoisseur of alien invasion movies, then definitely check this one out.",1287273600,5,1047,4.794444444444444
2163252,3,B00062IESM,"Alien Species is a really average movie with some of the cheesiest special effects I've ever seen.  It's a science fiction movie about these aliens in spaceships that come to visit earth and destroy all humans and buildings.  Well, the aliens must have been somewhat unorganized and confused, because more often than not, they'd strike empty dark barns and other deserted places, while the people right next to the homes or buildings were getting in their cars and driving away.  Yes somehow, the aliens didn't see them and so the people got away.  Strange!

Some of the other scenes were just cliches of other movies, such as the guy who awakens in the middle of the night, hears a strange noise out in his barn, and when he gets out there, an alien is waiting for him (who he mistakens for a little boy).  Of course, you know what happens next.

What REALLY bothered me were the special scenes that showed the alien spaceships attacking the city.  You'd see explosions when a hoard of spaceships got together to attack, but yet, the buildings weren't exploding or falling down.  You'd just see orange explosions with nothing actually falling apart. CHEESY!

Oh, and did I mention the main character?  He's a guy who gets out of a prison van to help two women and their father (or grandfather, whatever) escape from the crazy aliens.  He has some of the worst lines ever.  ""I don't think we're in Kansas anymore"" is one of them.  Man, that's just wrong.  He actually acted very similar to Leon from the Resident Evil 2 video game, which came out just a couple years after this movies release.  Maybe a coincidence, maybe not.

Overall, not really worth watching unless you REALLY need some alien-shooting fun in your life.",1200528000,7,1723,4.69
2163253,3,B00062IESM,"Global supertars Charles Napier and Hoke Howell headline this tale of aliens in computer-generated ships gone mad! The amazing thing about this movie is it's scope (or lack thereof). We see snipets of cartoon ships blasting city-scapes, while 99.9% of the action takes place in a prison van, a sheriff's office, and a cave! Actually, this works fairly well, although it could have been about 20 minutes shorter without losing much ""suspense"". So, go ahead and watch, knowing that it could have been far worse...",1156204800,,511,5.023529411764706
8037613,1,B00062IESM,"An exceedingly minor masterpiece from 1996, this sci-fi adventure is nothing less than spectacularly-supremely abysmal.  I have seen many low-low-low budget movies, but never one that appears to have been made with no budget whatsoever.  And yet, they still managed to attract a couple of almost big name actors (Charles Napier as Sheriff Culver and Hoke Howell as Professor Chambers).  The rest of the cast was potluck, come as you are, no talent required........can you walk and talk at the same time, you're hired!

Boy howdy but this one was a stinker.  The plot, such as it was, involved alien abductions, alien attacks, and trying to escape from the self-same aliens who wanted to shove people into these bulbous sacks then hang them from the ceiling of a cave like some demented piatas.  The credits defined them as Huge Aliens, Small Aliens, and Zombies.  (I must have blinked and missed the zombies.  I might have almost forgiven them had they included zombies.)  Worse than the acting was the dialog.

This wasn't just a wasted effort, it was a lost cause, a misuse of film, and more to the point..........what about the time I wasted watching it!!!",1430092800,,1159,4.86734693877551
8037614,2,B00062IESM,"This is one of the crumbiest movies you will come across. It is too cheap to be campy. Very low budget. Barrowed the Sleestak suits from ""Land of the Lost""  a 1974-1976 TV series.

A tad of blood, but mostly running, running, screaming and screaming.

Basically the world is being attacked by aliens for nefarious purposes. The poor aliens never dreamed with we would shoot them down with an old stile anti-tank weapon the just happened to be available.",1416614400,,453,4.708860759493671
8037615,1,B00062IESM,"This is an MST quality film, not worth watching. The film opens up with a prophecy about the future of a space invasion that takes place in 1999. While looking at a still photo of a distant galaxy, Max and Holly spot an invading armada attempting to be undetected. The science was really bad. The aliens attack major cities, but must leave their attacking ship to go on foot in a cave in small town USA.

Appears as part of some Mill Creek larger collections.

 most of the shows are so bad they don't even show them on cable.
and the ones that a good are old and public domain
prime video had a good idea... but doesn't put up.

8037617,2,B00062IESM,The release date has to be wrong. I felt like I was watching a bad late 1980s film school project complete with cheesy NewTek Video Toaster effects.,1388534400,,148,4.518518518518518
8037618,1,B00062IESM,"State of the art effects for 20 years ago; dialog that made giant assumptions and leaps producing no sense at all.  There was some good acting by female players though.  Quips and one-liners abound, Rambo style, but thankfully w/o Rambo.  This must have taken a week to film.",1381708800,,275,4.6875
8037619,3,B00062IESM,"The movie was cheaply done as far as special effects. But it has a good story and plot. Seemed a little dark and sometimes blurry, maybe they were adding to the effects.",1381449600,,169,4.3125
8037620,1,B00062IESM,"This movie is by far the worst thing to be captured on celluloid since ""Manos: Hands of Fate"". However, I find myself wanting to watch it yet again (I watched it about 30 times when it was on Netflix streaming. It's like watching a horrible disaster (i.e. 9/11, Hindenburg, Space Shuttles, etc....) you just can't believe what you are looking at! Try it!",1379030400,,354,4.634920634920635

The plot seemed too predictable.
