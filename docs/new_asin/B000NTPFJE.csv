2780933,5,B000NTPFJE,"""Prince of Foxes"" was one of Tyrone Powers' best performances. Orson Welles was superb as ""Cesare Borgia""....the supporting cast....led by Everett Sloan made this little known ""Classic"". Worth every penny.",1250899200,,205,5.866666666666666
2780934,5,B000NTPFJE,"1949's Prince of Foxes is splendid fun, and smart with it. Rather than his usual noble avenging hero, Tyrone Power gets a much grittier role as Andrea Orsini, an unscrupulous soldier of fortune determined to advance in Cesare Borgia's court by any means necessary. In this pit of vipers, everyone is a duplicitous s***, wit is vicious (especially when dealt out by Welles), knowledge is always a good investment and everything, even death, can be turned into profit. For Borgia (Orson Welles at his best), ""The great know only one law - the outcome justifies the act,"" and, boasting the appetite for greatness no matter what the cost, Orsini readily jumps at the chance to get ahead by agreeing to kill a rival count and seduce his wife so that Borgia may enter his land ""through a bedroom"" without the necessity for a battle. Naturally, with a character this corrupt played by the studio's biggest star it's inevitable that Orsini is going to have a date with redemption and double cross his boss for love and a new found sense of honor and purpose, but the film doesn't lose it's sense of devious fun doing it thanks to a sharp script by Milton Krims. Like Captain From Castile, based on a novel by Samuel Shellabarger, this is an altogether more successful adaptation, not least because it doesn't stint on the immorality and violence and follows the story to a satisfying conclusion.

Power's at his best here, clearly welcoming the chance to add more shade to his usual swashbuckling heroes and more than up to the challenge. It's a pity that the story doesn't allow Welles more screen time: he's having so much wry fun dispensing wicked wisdom here that he fully justifies director Henry King's eagerly pursuit of him for the role despite admitting that ""putting his name on the marquee of a theatre is the same as putting the word smallpox up."" His old Mercury Players cohort Everett Sloane provides excellent honest duplicity as Orsini's would-be assassin and subsequent sidekick, casting a welcome shadow over the proceedings whenever goodness looks like it might take hold. While it's a shame the film wasn't shot in Technicolor to take advantage of the glorious location photography - possibly because the extra lights then needed for colour work wouldn't have done the frescoes and artworks much good - the black and white cinematography does make effective use of far from romantic moonlit canals and dark Venetian alleys. Rather terrific.

Extras on the region 1 NTSC DVD include a Movietone news extract od Power's Italian wedding, an isolated score track for Alfred Newman's acclaimed score, stills and advertising gallery and a Spanish trailer.",1241827200,9,2661,4.924276169265033

2780938,5,B000NTPFJE,"I am happy to see the DVD release of Prince of Foxes. This movie is a gem I first encountered years ago on the midday movie channel and I've loved it ever since. Tyrone Power plays an impostor posing as a nobleman in the service of Cesare Borgia. Sent to subvert a castle town that stands in the way of Borgia's ambition to rule central Italy, Power falls in love with the young duchess who rules the place and determines to oppose his old boss and defend the town. The town falls, Power is revealed to be a mere peasant, but that's not all there is to the story...

Prince of Foxes is full of romance, intrigue, treachery, loyalty, honor, and adventure. It's a must for any swashbuckling collection.",1183939200,9,700,4.426356589147287
2780939,4,B000NTPFJE,"Wanda Hendrix the the light weight starlet here. She was married to someone (can't remember now) semi famous.(Audie Murphy?) She ruins the picture for me and cannot play the love interest to the handsome, dashing Tyrone Power. Welles is always good and played with Tyrone in the Black Rose.

Enjoyable movies of another place and time. Not full of 4 letter words and explicit bedroom scenes. Romantic and entertaining.",1181865600,8,418,5.057971014492754
2780940,2,B000NTPFJE,"This is supposed to be a swashbuckler with lots of action and adventure. It is far from that.  It is slow moving.  Tyrone Power is as usual handsome, and beyond that gives a fair performance at best.  Orson Welles as Cesare Borgia is ""over the top"" evil.  Wanda Hendrix is not at all believable.  She seems to be a teeny bobber in costume.  How Tyrone could find her fascinating rather than the beautiful Marina Berti is hard to understand.  It is too bad that this was filmed in black and white as the sets, countryside, and costumes would have been marvelous in color and possibly helped to add to the movie.  The Alfred Newman score was also very fine.",1178409600,5,655,4.445378151260504

2780976,5,B000NTPFJE,"In 1949, Italy was a basket case, years of Mussolini, then war, then German occupation and more war, then turmoil and revolution after the war.  It was a cheap and great place to make movies by the fortunate Americans in the late forties and the fifties.  so they made this movie on location in Italy.  Tyrone Power was beginning to fade by then as a big Hollywood star so he made this movie quickly in Italy for his loyal fans.  He is our hero in his fight against the Borgias, rulers of Central Italy in the early Renassiance period.
It is a great story, on location, with a rather unknown actress.  However, she is pretty and plays the role well.  I have enjoyed alot.",1398729600,,671,4.370967741935484
2780977,5,B000NTPFJE,"First there is the music score, which keeps coming back to a very beautiful theme.  As the end of the movie, this theme becomes utterly magnificent.
  Second, there is Tyrone Power. In every scene he wears yet another splendid costume, each one better than the last.
  Third, there is the wonderful Wanda Hendrix.  Though young, she does a great job of keeping up with her better known co-stars (Orson Welles and Ty Power).  Near the end of the movie, as Power sword-fights with one villain after another, watch Wanda's face as she works at changing from one thought to another, her beautiful face constantly moving, constantly shifting expressions.  She does a great job!
  Orson Welles, of course, is great.  But then, he's always great.",1398124800,3,739,4.879032258064516

Attempting to control of medieval Italy, Borga sends Power and a assasin to spy on the weakness of Citte De Monte ruled by a foe, and murder him. The ruler is aged and has a young wife who treat him kindly.  Power finds that the count is honorable.  He reconsiders his orders and switches sides.  He is later captured by Borga's men and tortured in prison.  He is brought to Borga's court to have the assasin gouged out his eyes.  With a slight of hand, the assasin pretends to commit this act and later provides his escape.  The tables are turned once against Borga.  This is a solid swashbuckler and excellent cast.

2780980,5,B000NTPFJE,"This is a historically significant film about the dominance of the Borgia family in medieval Italy. Tyrone Power was a prolific actor turning out one outstanding film after another in his too-short life. His nemesis, Cesare Borgia, is played by Orson Welles, the iconic film villain of his era and another excellent actor. The plot has many twists and surpises and always has the suspense of what will happen next. This is a ""must see"" movie.",1381104000,2,442,4.828947368421052

2780993,5,B000NTPFJE,"Tyrone Power's very good looks unfortunately resulted in his being cast in alot of puff movies and he was not taken seriously as an actor. In this excellent movie he shows remarkable depth as an actor and he better since he collaborates with two excellent thespians, Everett Sloane and Orson Wells(both are great in this movie). This classic movie along with Nightmare Alley, Abandon Ship and Witness For The Prosecution show that Power had extraordinary abilities as an actor.
From 1949 and in glorious black and white, everything about this movie denotes quality. It was filmed entirely in Italy and has an excellent soundtrack. Don't miss this movie!",1348790400,,653,5.055555555555555
2780994,4,B000NTPFJE,"Well, it's not easy to follow, but it is interesting. It's 1500, and as the story opens, we attend the funeral of Lucretia Borgia's husband. They say it was not a natural death.

Duke Cesare Borgia (Orson Welles) figures the new widow is a useful pawn in his power game, and sends one of his best emissaries, Andrea Orsini (Tyrone Power) to arrange a match. At one of the stops along the way, Orsini meets the beautiful Camilla Verano, wife of the elegant old Count Verano of Citta del Monte, a walled fortress city on a high mountain, which everyone agrees ought to be impregnable.

When Orsini returns to Borgia, his next assignment is as ambassador to Citta del Monte, with the understanding that he and his assassin (interesting story there) are to do away with the Count and the Countess will be Orsini's reward.

However, in the course of the winter and into the spring, Orsini discovers two things. First, the young countess is indeed loyal to and very fond of her much older husband, who had been a close friend of her father's. Second, Orsini himself develops a strong admiration for the Count and for his people, who are courageous and loyal to their Count and Countess.

If Borgia was not so obviously evil and treacherous and Count Verano wise and honorable, Orsini's coming to side with him against his former patron would be far less respectable. But there's treachery and duplicity all over this story. Indeed, Orsini's assassin Mario Belli seems to change sides more often than he changes his clothes. He is Orsini's assassin because he was originally sent to assassinate Orsini, but Orsini managed to turn him. After that, the audience may find it hard indeed to know where his loyalties lie at any given moment.

A real adventure, swashbuckling and grand, and a lot of fun. But several characters look enough alike that you may become confused. I did, and I had on the close captions. As for myself, I got absorbed in the magnificent costumes, in spite of the fact that this is a black and white movie.",1336780800,,2020,4.67887323943662
2780995,5,B000NTPFJE,"One of the best books I have ever read.  I saw the movie over 60 years ago.  Orson Wells still amoung the greatest actors of our times.

2780997,5,B000NTPFJE,"Here is a thinking person's historical swashbuckler, very satisfying and enjoyable and full of ironic wit.  Welles is in the zone here and Ty seems to relish his chance to play an anti-heroic lead ala Nightmare Alley.  Plus, Everett Sloane is loosed on a major role and relishes ever minute.

The location shooting as well as the stark yet rich B&W cinematography may put you in mind of later Welles' films including his Othello and Chimes at Midnight.  There's also a cool touch of having burning oiled poured off a battlement splashing up on the lens, as well as the subjective eye-gouging scene.",1262044800,4,598,4.776699029126213
2780998,4,B000NTPFJE,"I agree with the general tone of the above reviews. Indeed, Welles proved once again his extraordinary thespian ability. However, I'm glad it wasn't filmed in color, which I have always considered appropriate for musicals and travelogues. For nuance, mood and character, you can't beat B&W. I'm sorry, but for some reason color seems to shift the emphasis more from highbrow to lowbrow art, providing less opportunity for the creative cinematographer. Please forgive my foppish airs, but you gotta respect my old gray head. Another thing: as my creaky old brain seems to recall, when I saw the film in '49 everyone in the theatre gasped at the eye gouging scene, and Sloane's subterfuge was explained in flashback. Can anyone set the record straight with some certainty?",1259107200,,770,5.070866141732283

8181306,5,B000NTPFJE,"I just love everything about this film. The screenplay by Milton Krims is structurally perfect and squeezes all the meat out of a weak novel, which I thought was rather silly particularly in the section involving the old countpresented in the film with such dignity and appeal by Felix Aylmer. Leon Shamroys beautiful photography captures the wonderful Italian locations and gives a strong sense of the Renaissance. Foxes has been criticized for being shot in black-and-white, but not by me. This film is a good example of how black-and-white can be artistically superior to color. For example, the scenes in Venice, the scene where the troops are marching off to battle in the early morning haze, and the cavalry charge are truly remarkable. Alfred Newman, one of my favorite movie composers, delivered one of his best scores. I have the CD and play it often. Direction by Henry King, as always, is tops. As for the actors, Ive saved the best for last. Tyrone Power has never been given proper credit for his screen acting. In Foxes, he is superb both in the way the camera loves him and the assuredness with which he delivers the marvelously sophisticated dialogue. Try to imagine a contemporary actor dealing with some of Powers lines. I cant. Power in Foxes is the consummate screen hero. Orson Welles, always a fascinating actor, gives one of his most exciting characterizations as Cesare Borgia. As Paul Newman once observed, Welles dominates every scene he is inalthough Power always manages to hold his own. Everett Sloanes portrayal of the assassin is one of his best. He is obviously enjoying himself in the role and is a pleasure to watch. Felix Aylmer and Katina Paxinou, two of my favorite character actors, are spectacular in Foxes. Wanda Hendrix is a bit of a lightweight but she does the job of the love interest without screwing up the picture. All together, Prince of Foxes has a solid place in my top 10 list.",1479859200,3,1928,4.8102409638554215
8181307,4,B000NTPFJE,"Orson Welles (1915-85) created some of the very best theatre, radio, and films in history, and is credited by almost everyone for making the #1 film of all time  Citizen Kane (1941). But he started having problems with producers and studios, left projects unfinished, went over budget, and a whole host of problems that ultimately resulted in fewer and fewer films of lesser and lesser quality. By 1949, when this film was made, Welles was already in trouble and exhibiting many of the problems that would unhinge his career. Though his brilliance would always shine through even the shabbiest of projects he undertook, it became harder and harder to find.

He made The Prince of Foxes in 1949 as part of his European phase in which he was acting to raise money to fund his projects (esp. Othello that ultimately appeared in 1952).  Together with Tyrone Power they also made The Black Rose in 1950.

Welles is still young and full of vitality, and his performance as Cesar Borgia is excellent.

Everett Sloane (1909-65) plays an assassin. He appeared in more than 100 films and TV programs and was part of the Orson Welles stock company. In fact his film debut was in Citizen Kane (1941) as Mr. Bernstein and he appeared in several films with Welles (Journey into Fear, Lady from Shanghai). He transitioned to TV in the early 50s and was nominated for an Emmy in 1956 for his role in the Kraft Television Theatre. Sloane is over the top in this film, as he was in all his Welles films. But Sloan was able to be over the top and still turn in a great performance, as he did elsewhere and as he does here.

Tyrone Power (1914-58) was 20th Century Foxs challenge to MGMs Errol Flynn. He was doing bit parts when director Henry King cast him in Lloyds of London (1936) which launched his career. From 1936 to 42 he cranked out a few films every year, some of them notable  Suez (1938), Jesse James (1939), The Mark of Zorro (1940), Blood and Sand (1941). He was never nominated for an Oscar, although his performance in Witness for the Prosecution (1957) certainly deserved one.

Power once said  The secret of charm is bulls*** and his film roles were filmed with charm. He was never as charming as he is in this film, one of his best from my POV. Power plays a peasant who pretends to be a nobleman and serves Borgia until he falls in love.

Felix Aylmer (1889-1979) plays the head of a rival Duchy. Of his 150+ films, Aylmer is best known for his roles as Polonius in Oliviers Hamlet (1948) and as the Archbishop of Canterbury from Becket (1964). He does his usual good job here.

Director Henry King (1886-1982) was nominated for an Oscar in 1943 (Song of Bernadette) and 1944 (Wilson), won the Golden Globe for Bernadette and DGA nominations for his work with Gregory Peck in David and Bathsheba (1951) and The Snows of Kilimanjaro (1952). He directed more than 100 films between 1915 and 1962, and worked with Power on nearly a dozen films including Lloyds of London (1936), The Sun Also Rises (1957), and Captain from Castile (1947).

The music and photography (unfortunately B&W) are magnificent.

The big Oscar winners in 1949 were Hamlet (Picture, Actor, Art Direction, Costume Design) and Treasure of the Sierra Madre (Director, Screenplay, Supporting Actor). The top box office hits were Samson and Delilah, Battleground, Jolson Sings Again, The Sands of Iwo Jima, and I Was a Male Order Bride. Other notable films that year were All the Kings Men, Champion, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Twelve OClock High and White Heat.

This is a better than average film that benefits from great acting.",1466121600,2,3596,4.660347551342812
