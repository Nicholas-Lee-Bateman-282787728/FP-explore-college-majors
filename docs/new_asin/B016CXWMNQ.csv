8736330,4,B016CXWMNQ,"This is a fun parody/tribute to the classic old black-and-white sci-fi/horror b-movies of the 1950s.  This is the best of young Joshua Kennedy's movies that I have seen so far, and it demonstrates that he has great promise as a filmmaker.  (Some of his older youthful movies are not so good, so it's nice to see that his skill is improving over the years.)  This is a fun movie that I would recommend for fans of old-school sci-fi/horror.",1514592000,,438,4.589743589743589

8736332,4,B016CXWMNQ,"This is my first Joshua Kennedy film, and I had a good time with it.  It's shot-through with tributes to other SF/monster films and characters, and is fairly well constructed.  The script could have been tighter (a problem with a lot of modern B-movie tributes), and the acting and shot choice are a little shaky in places.  But, there's some fun and creative low-budget work here -- certainly enough for me to check out some of the other films.  (The actor-director-writer is quite good as anti-hero Dr. Vesuvius.)  I'd probably only give this film 3 stars - ***--, but the package gets an extra star -- +* -- for the Beast from 20 Zillion Years Ago, which is a really fun stop-motion monster short shot on a shoestring budget.  Harryhausen it ain't, but it'll probably make you smile.",1449100800,,786,4.659420289855072
