7850819,2,6303521525,"I know this film was a smash hit with everyone who saw it.
I'm sorry but it was a disappointment to me. I almost couldn't understand a word that these British actresses said so of
 course I could not figure out what it was about.",999475200,,229,4.088888888888889
7850820,5,6303521525,"From the very first episode it was clear that this was going to be a smash hit success. This classic British comedy series starred the highly talented writer and actress, Jennifer Saunders as Edina Monsoon, head of an incompetent fashion business. Also in the cast are Joanna Lumley as foul mouthed, chain smoking, Patsy Stone, Edina's so called best friend. It is interesting to see Lumley shed her previously squeaky clean, aristocratic image to play a character who's every other word is either a swear word or something blatantly vulgar. She is an absolutley essental part of the series as Saunders and Lumley sparkle together as a pair of drug taking, promiscuous pair of alcoholics. Also included are comedy veteran, June Whitfield who was renowned for her role in the sitcom, Terry And June and appeared in a handful of the Carry On films and finally Julia Sawahala as Edina's poor put upon daughter, Saffron who plays the character perfectly.
The series was a winner from its classic opening episode which set the tone for the rest of the series. The rollercoaster dialogue is full of inventive repartee and bubbles with razor sharp wit, making this one of the very best comedy programmes from Britain (if not THE best)! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",991526400,4,1248,4.919431279620853
7850821,5,6303521525,"This is a perfect tape to have around for entertaining your friends or for just relaxing after a stressful day.  My teenage daughter was also having a good time watching and being able to relate. The stories of a professsional woman and her best friend who is always up for a drink will put your problems in a different perspective. You just have to get this tape, ""dahling"".",975110400,2,375,4.514705882352941
7850822,5,6303521525,"Ok.
Yes, Saunders and Lumley have created two living legends with their characters Edina and Patsy.  But make no mistake boys and girls, this is highbrow humor. The average American couch potato might not ""get""  what is going on at times.  (i.e. ""why is that so funny?) However, if  you enjoy Monty Python, Mr. Bean, Are You Being Served, or any other form  of English humor, you will find this show admist your favorites.  But, yet  again, even if you do not like English humor I suggest you try it one more  time......I never get tired watching these two perform.
Episode  Guide:
FASHION - Edina freaks out because she has a fashion show to  organize and this time she has to be sober. (until afterwards.......)
FAT  - Edina diets to impress old rival.  And Patsy pairs up with a gym  instructor who helps her out.....sort of.......
FRANCE - ABSOLUTELY one  of the best AB FAB episodes....... Holiday! Pats and Eddie go on a French  holiday, which includes getting lost, Pats enjoying ping pong sober, and  the odd French man who keeps arriving periodically at the front door to  harass them.........",956534400,4,1102,4.71578947368421
7850823,5,6303521525,Being a Brit living in America I miss the comedy most of all so being able to get Ab Fab on video is excellent.  I found the France section of this video fantastic (especially with the 'stolen' steering wheel) and Patsy's  horror when she realised she had actually enjoyed playing ping pong without  the usage of drugs.  Fantastic series.,945302400,5,338,4.677966101694915
7850824,5,6303521525,"ab fab is totally amazing. the series characters  are so totally outrageous that you won't believe it however my english husband says that he knew people just like them!  they relate to every day life in their own  unique way yet somehow it is  always relevant to today. women especially  can  relate to eddie & patsy regardless of the year. somehow the men  are always condescending yet the ""girls"" see through it and  triumph. Eddie & Patsy are always enertaining trying to be  adult while  remaining in the adolescent sixties! if you appreciate a dry english sense  of humor these characters will appeal to you.",944265600,,614,4.752380952380952
