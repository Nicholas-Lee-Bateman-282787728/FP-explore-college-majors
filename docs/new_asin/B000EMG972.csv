2523358,4,B000EMG972,"Simply wonderful rendering: perfect cast, lovely score, beautiful undercut direction. The only warning I have is to turn off the DVD near the end, when Carrie and her brother are leaving Wales. Thereafter is botched and incongruent. If you're going to use a certain convention, one must do it in the first ten minutes of a story - not introduce it at the ending, where it clumsily destroys all the lovely moments preceding it. Nonetheless, a terrificly enjoyable 90 minutes.",1145232000,17,474,4.9375
2523359,5,B000EMG972,"I came across this movie on a BBC channel late one night and was instantly intrigued.  The characters are enchanting and the storyline always keeps you interested.  I stayed up way too late watching it through to the end, but it was worth it, and now I'm buying it on DVD to share with my kids and looking for the book.  It's great!!!!!!",1144886400,18,337,4.317460317460317

Thank you for being so fast and having what I wonted and such a good price for a already viewed product.",1275004800,,281,4.875
2523361,4,B000EMG972,"I almost didn't want this movie b/c of some of the less favorable reviews - I thought something awful must happen at the end. Instead, you find out this is a story within a story. Yes, the actress who played the grown-up Carrie didn't look much like the young Carrie, but that's a minor quibble. Yes, the end is full of coincidences and was sugar sweet, yet I wouldn't have wanted a sadder, more realistic ending. It left me with a sense of hope and magic. It was a sweet, feel-good film.",1242432000,3,488,4.315217391304348
2523362,5,B000EMG972,This was a great look into the time period of the second world war and what it was like for children relocated away from their homes.  Good characters - and realistic.,1228521600,,167,4.387096774193548
2523363,5,B000EMG972,"Carrie Willow and her younger brother are evacuees from London during World War II.  They are taken to a small town in Wales, where a young woman living with her very strict older brother takes them in.  Over the next few months Carrie and her brother meet other members of their adoptive family and learn many surprising secrets. Eventually, everyone learns much more about the power of love, acceptance, friendship and forgiveness.

This is a very well done film, accurately depicting life in World War II Britain.  The characters are all appealing, and there's enough humor to keep some of the weightier themes from bogging the story down, so even the youngest children should love it and learn from it.  The ending, set twenty five years or so in the future, is especially affecting and bound to bring tears to your eyes.",1212710400,4,825,4.78169014084507
2523364,2,B000EMG972,"I was bored to death and almost fell asleep.  You might have to be british to enjoy this.  I already gave my copy to a friend who might maybe like it better than I did. The DVD-Cover looks nice, though.",1199232000,2,202,4.025
2523365,3,B000EMG972,"Nicely made, mostly reflecting the book quite well - the book itself is framed by the mother's adult recollections, so the movie ending is no surprise. Yes, the acting is good, and some of the complexity of the adult relations which Carrie is beginning to understand come through well.

BUT. I was not too surprised to see the few references to Mr. Evans grim religion of endurance and the even fewer references to Hepzibah's mysterious awareness and healing skills expanded into a more extreme caricature of happy harmless pagans vs miserable domineering christians (though paganism as we know it wasn't invented when Bawden wrote her book!), but I was disgusted to see Bawden's reference to the lives of black child slaves in England totally whitewashed out of sight in favor of this anachronistic little wallow in new age sentiment. Not to mention Albert's cool assessment of the skull's more likely origins - more prosaic in Carrie's eyes, but probably much more exciting in his own eyes, and a fine summing-up of their two different characters -pity it was wasted!

I was really surprised to see Carrie superimposed over this invented pagan maiden thing at the end, as if she bolts from adult life completely!",1182643200,4,1214,4.946078431372549
2523366,1,B000EMG972,"this dvd cannot be viewed on our machine, ridiculous for a dvd made with the cooperation of european t v companies. better information is required!",1169164800,,147,4.92
2523367,3,B000EMG972,"Excellent movie, theme, actors, scenery until the incredibly disappointing ending. The author gave up and created a cheesy ending that didn't seem to have anything to do with the first 99% of the movie. We felt like we were watching two completely different movies. If it had been written differently, this would have been one we would have watched over and over. Instead we turned it off and said, ""What was that?""  It has gone into the Good Will basket.",1168560000,5,455,4.6875
2523368,5,B000EMG972,"This movie was very touching, well acted, and just a joy to watch.  The story line is moving and very clever.  My sixteen year old daughter and I just love it!  I highly recommend this movie.",1167782400,3,191,4.25
2523369,5,B000EMG972,"I loved this movie, and I loved the ending!  One reviewer said to turn off the DVD when Carrie and her brother are leaving Wales, but if you've never read the book, you'll be left hanging!  Please watch ALL of this movie!  It is wonderful. You won't regret it.",1150761600,11,260,4.26530612244898
8111350,5,B000EMG972,"A delightful movie- lighthearted but with a touch of seriousness.  I do not think we appreciate what people, including children, went through in WWII Great Britain.  One gets the flavor of that time, spiced though with the adventure, and poignant experiences of children growing up at that time.",1512172800,,295,5.125

8111355,5,B000EMG972,Interesting story with interesting characters. Kid actors are ok; adult actors are very familiar to those of us who watch PBS! Excellent!,1406592000,,137,5.2727272727272725
8111356,5,B000EMG972,"A very enjoyable film with unexpected Welsh folklore, very pro-Druid, a strong story, sterling performances, beautiful scenery and sympathetic portrayals.",1373155200,,154,6.75
8111357,5,B000EMG972,"A beautifully done adaptation of the book by Nina Bawden. During Second World War Britain Carrie Willows (Keeley Fawcett) and her younger brother Nick (Jack Stanley) are evacuated as were hundreds of thousands of other British children from the larger cities and towns into the countryside. They are billeted out to a village in Wales they are fostered by the dour disciplinarian, the local shopkeeper Samuel Evans (Alun Armstrong) a widower and his younger sister, the timid Aunty Lou (Lesley Sharp) who soon grows very fond of the children
Carrie makes her way into the hearts of most of the people and when the children are sent on an errand to Druid's Bottom they are introduced to Hepzibah Green, reputed to be witch, her cerebral palsy son Mr Johnny (Jamie Beddard) and the reclusive Mrs. Dilys Gotobed (Geraldine McEwan). They are introduced to magic and local lore, there will be much heartache and twists of events which all makes for a  charming , heart-warming,  wonderful family movie, with a realistic setting, and whose events are tied up neatly in the end. A happy ending-yes, but not un-lifelike in the way it is done. Happy endings do exist.",1356825600,,1158,4.873096446700508
8111358,5,B000EMG972,"Carrie's War surprised me in presenting the main character as a confident and brave young teen. It is hard enough to imagine evacuation to the countryside with forced separation from parents, but to have no certain place to go? How would any youngster handle it? Timid and frightened. Even after they were relectantly chosen at last, they ended up in the home of a serious disciplinarian.

Carrie and even her little brother take it all in stride and even manage to enjoy their situation. Carrie is certainly not a Pollyanna, but she does manage to win over most around her. She also begins to discover boys. But it isn't until the end of her stay that she cracks through the thick skin of her disciplinarian host in the countryside.

Carrie's War is a good family movie and a great movie for young girls who need strong role models.",1300406400,3,833,4.621621621621622
8111359,5,B000EMG972,"If you're not afraid of happy endings and lovely stories with good hearted people, then you'll love this.  It's a beautifully done film, as we've come to expect from Masterpiece Theater.  The acting is all first rate; the children are perfect.

Some folks equate misery with artfulness and they are the ones who complain about the ending.  Too bad; there are plenty of dreary, sick, depressing films for them to see.",1276214400,,416,4.816901408450704
