3724440,5,B001NY6YQ6,"I first became aware of Aleister Crowley through press reports that Jimmy Page of led Zeppelin, had been studying the occultist. A period of reading the books of Dennis Wheatley brought a greater awareness of the occult where Crowley's name was frequently mentioned.

This film begins with the impending death of the man whilst being visited by two students from Cambridge University (UK). Just before he dies he curses one of the students and inflicts serious injury to him. Sixty years on, at Cambridge there is a conjunction between scientific experiments in a virtual world and the continuing tradition of the occult within the confines of the University. During that conjunction, one of the dons becomes possessed by the spirit of Crowley and graduall transforms into him

The transformation presages a series of events which appear to have been predestined by Crowley and his followers many years before. The purpose of the events gradually unfolds, as they tend to do in these matters, into the return of the fallen angel.

Simon Callow, the RSC actor excels in his portrayal of the restored Crowley. His energies reflect the larger than life personality of the occultist and the notorious acts for which he was infamous during his lifetime. This is a film of graphic sexuality and bodily functions. Although there is nudity and depictions of orgies and other sexual acts, they are not exhibited except in their role as part of the magickal power. The acts are more of the means by which spells are enacted, a transference of the power of the body into other powerful forms.

Many people will find this film objectionable for a variety of reasons, the subject of the occult or satanic worship, the sexual nature and use of profanities, the rejection of christian sensibilities or for many other reasons. Nevertheless it is a powerful depiction of the life of Crowley itself. Ultimately, in the final scenes of the film, very reminiscent of the previous fim, The Devil Rides Out, the world is restored to order.

Given the difficult subject matter, I think that this film has done a first rate job in enlightening the life and works of Aleister Crowley and is to be commended for it.",1236556800,17,2189,4.889487870619946

3724510,3,B001NY6YQ6,"Being a fan of Bruce Dickinson, the co-writer of the script, I really wanted to like this film. Unfortunately, while there are definitely things to like about it, the film is fatally undermined by profoundly poor editing choices. Based on the deleted scenes and the director's commentary on the DVD, the story initially featured an interesting and reasonably plausible science fiction premise that lies somewhere between ""Snow Crash"" and ""The Matrix"": the ancient concept that magical energy derives from the ""vibration of the spheres"" (an idea which Crowley believed and refined) was a primitive, intuitive model of string theory, and processing magical symbols and formulae with a quantum computer might result in access to alternate dimensions predicted by quantum theory (thereby facilitating Crowley's ""resurrection""). However, the editing philosophy seems to have been ""if it makes sense, cut it"", and the plot in the finished film comes across as utter gibberish. Similarly, numerous situations that seem to be unlikely coincidences or outright continuity flaws would be logical and believable if key plot points hadn't been left on the cutting room floor.

On the bright side, the film looks gorgeous despite being shot on a shoestring budget. The details about Aleister Crowley are meticulously researched; they are based on Crowley's own correspondence and other writings, as well as public reports of his infamously bad behavior. Simon Callow's performance as the resurrected Crowley delightfully manifests a man who was the real life embodiment of ""over the top"". When Crowley's plan to remain among the living takes a sinister turn, Callow's mercurial swings from comically irreverent to shockingly violent create the most unpredictably menacing character since Malcolm McDowell's portrayal of Alex in A Clockwork Orange.",1443398400,,1834,5.526690391459074

3724571,1,B001NY6YQ6,"Another rather short review it seems on another movie that took me some time to get around to watching. Had I never done so I don't believe I would have missed a thing.
This film is noted simply because one of the writers behind it is Bruce Dickinson, the lead singer of the heavy metal group Iron Maiden. Suffice to say that he should stick to writing heavy metal and not films.

The story revolves around Alistair Crowley, a man connected with much evil and mystery back in the early 1900s. Crowley was accused of dabbling in witchcraft, Satanism, orgies, drugs and more and was considered quite a notorious person which has led to a certain amount of fascination with him. References to him can be found in images on the SGT. PEPPER album and in the song ""Mr. Crowley"" by Ozzy Osbourne.

What we're presented with here is the death of Crowley as witnessed by two students who took an interest in him. Having claimed to have been born many times and lived many lives, he tells them in passing he'll return. Fast forward to the present and we have one of the students now grown and teaching at a university in England. At this same university a study is going on involving a super computer being attached to a human brain. Unfortunately the programmer of that computer is also into Crowley and has programmed in as much information and spells made by him into the computer as well. The end result is that Crowley is reborn in the person of a rather timid professor by possessing him.

What follows is Crowley's attempts to make the possession permanent. This involves orgies, drugs, spells and more that must be completed within 4 days for it to take hold. As he does so the professor who was involved with the computer along with a young student who's a journalist attempt to find out just what is going on at the campus and why the timid professor of before is now so bold.

I imagine if you were fascinated with the title character or believed in the items presented this might be a decent film. I found it tedious to the extreme and boring on the whole. I wasn't left wanting to know more about the real man but instead ready to find a new home for the copy of the film I was watching. Pass this one by.",1342569600,2,2208,4.417690417690418
3724572,1,B001NY6YQ6,"ZERO STARS!

This picture is extremely offensive and frankly, sick.  The plot is completely ridiculous.  It seemed to play off the tabloid trash depiction of Crowley that was so prevalent during his life.  It in no way depicted his genius, only an embellished view of his arrogance, and a gross exaggeration of his sexual proclivities.  I do understand that Crowley embellished himself to the media at the time, but it would have been nice to have depicted a more holistic view of who he was rather than this tripe.

I am also disappointed with Simon Callow; he's been in such great movies in the past, Merchant/Ivory productions, etc. I don't understand why he'd agree to be in this one. Given the production values (the computer systems looked like something out of the original Star Trek), surely he didn't do it for the money, the producers clearly couldn't pay him more than scale.

I was so offended that I left the movie feeling disgusted and angry.  Fortunately it was a rental, if I owned a copy of the DVD I'd put it through the shredder!",1340928000,2,1048,4.657608695652174

It's really a shame that this movie is so bad because Bruce Dickinson has such a great knowledge of Crowley and his works that this movie could have been something very special.

3724577,5,B001NY6YQ6,"After watching and reviewing the movie ""Crowley"" written by legendary heavy metal singer Bruce Dickinson, and directed by Julian Doyle, I must say that it is quite an enjoyable movie.

To those who wish to enjoy a movie based on the life of Aliester Crowley, this is not it, albeit, the begining of the movie does focus on the 'The Beast'.  What you will find is a 'possibilty' of what could happen should Aliester Crowley return during present time and here is where a fictious story is told based on a real man.

Unless you are famillar with Aliester, the movie contain's graphic image's ... for us who are famillar, these image's are somewhat neccessary as they are and were a part of the maddness behind the genius.

Murder, Mayhem, Sex Magick, and more.  This is well written for a 'Factional'. A must-have for strong stomach die hard Iron Maiden fan's and Crowley follower's who are looking for a whimiscal movie knowing that it is not based entirely on the work's of the Occultist Aliester Crowley.

Though a low budget film, the true honour goes to Simon Callow who give's an absolutely brilliant portrayl of Aliester and the shy Proffessor Haddo, whom is possessed by Aliester.  Simon's acting is profound and make's you forget it is low budget. For those who know Simon Callow from ""Four Wedding's and A Funeral"", you can experience the broad spectrum of this amazing actor.  The twisting ending of this movie is excellent.

Low budget or not, the begining of Aliester Crowley's true return, via multimedia needed to begin, to which we should tip our hat's to Bruce Dickinson for pioneering a sorely needed glimpse at the engima of the man, Aliester Crowley.  Though, ;) he may have already reincarnated.

3724601,2,B001NY6YQ6,"Aleister Crowley, being the controversial figure he was, had a great deal of aspects of his life that one may rightfully dislike. He did some things that were not exactly suitable for polite society, and his career challenged pretty much the whole of religious thought of western civilization. However, the supermarket tabloid sensationalism that many people associate with Crowley is not exactly how it happened. It is rather the same with many, if not all, people who had shocked with their unorthodoxy. People invariably dislike them for all the wrong reasons.

OK: this was never meant to be a biopic. Fair enough. But the whole thing turned into a grade B horror movie that relied entirely on degenerate behavior and shock than real depth of what Crowley was doing - right or wrong. Perhaps Dickenson didn't understand Crowley, or he lacked the talent, skill, and experience as a director to transform it into a cinematic reality.

Unless you enjoy cheap shock tactics, puerile plot and premise, and a desperate attempt to milk every drop of depravity out of a largely imaginary legend, the film is a waste of time.",1252886400,3,1120,4.920634920634921

Watching this movie nearly put me to sleep while I was waiting for something interesting to happen. Other than tossing a few names and phrases into the movie that a Crowley fan would recognize there was nothing worthwhile about the movie. It seems the writer of this movie has never even picked up a Crowley book and had no clue about the rituals. Aside from that the movie wasn't even good horror unless you are afraid of nudity, or a bad script.

If they really wanted to make a good Crowley movie they should have focused on the early parts of his life where he encountered Egyptian Gods, Goetic demons, and Enochian ""angels"" or even cover his activities as a cult leader. Any of those topics could have made for a seriously interesting movie. As it was, it just dragged on and on without much of a plot or storyline.

 Unfortunately, it took a very rich and complex subject matter and reduced it to a one-dimensional pulp fiction version cast in a cheesy Dr. Who plot, and threw in some elements of Jack the Ripper in for good measure. They essentially took all of the wild rumors about Crowley at face value and then upped the ante by having him gratuitously kill hookers at every turn. Oh yeah, he can also travel in time and access the digital world behind the world ala The Matrix.

On the other hand, hearing Simon Callow's reading of Crowley's lewd poetry is worth the price all by itself. I think Crowley would have a damn good belly laugh at it if he were around to see it, and you should too. Just don't read much into it as even a semi-serious biographical work of the man.

The list of ""rock stars with brains"" is a short one, but Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson has written and produced the definitive Crowley Movie. Purists may balk at that statement, but this film is not by any means a biography. It is purely joyous exploitation at its finest.
It has been said that a magician without a sense of humor is unbearable and only the ""unholier than thou"" would take umbrage with this nasty little gem, which is entertaining AND magickally sound (except in one small instance, which alone would persuade the faithful to disparage the entire production. Their loss.)
The film's characterization of Crowley is based upon the tabloid descriptions of him during his lifetime, a popular opinion that prevails to this day. This movie does nothing to repair that opinion because again, it is NOT a biography.
This is a glorious ""what if?"" conceptualization of the Crowleyan corpus. Its all here and then some. Familiar names abound and as Crowley himself embraced the cutting-edge scientific discoveries of his time, the virtual-reality concepts of this film jibe neatly with his own imaginative flights of the fantastic.
All good fantasy films mess with your brain and this one includes a spectacular ""twist-ending.""
As intelligent as it is disgusting, this thoughtful little gem delivers its talent is right there on the screen. The photography and sound quality hint at a much larger production.
This movies isn't for everyone, but neither is Magick, nor the ""horror"" that is Aleister Crowley.

Simon Cowell makes an extraordinary performance as Crowley and I think that Master Therion himself would have appreciated the whole spectacle. However, if you are a serious student of Magick and expect to see an equally serious study of Crowleys work, look for another movie.

If your looking for a documentary on Aleister Crowley you are in entirely the wrong place as this has more reflection to the tabloid press of his day than to factual incidents which journalists managed to exaggerate and sensationalize almost as much as the movie does, but the movie does it in a much more tongue in cheek manner.

Followers of Master Therion and members of the Ordo Templi Orientis tend to take things much too seriously and as a result will have the same reaction as radical Christians would to the 'Life of Brian"" that the movie is tantamount to sacrilege but from reading about his life and studying the things said about him by friends and enemies in the magickal world of those heady days I would imagine he is laughing out loud about it and congratulating Simon Callow for his excellent performance even down to his voice inflections which can be heard from the few recordings that remain of Crowley.

Entertainment wise this did certainly entertain me and my friends from start to finish with some raised eyebrows and shocked gasps from some of the more explicit parts in the movie (which would be unremarkable in Europe where adverts for hair shampoo show much more) and from viewing the box cover I immediately knew, even before reading the blurb, that this was not going to be the great man's life history.

Julian Doyle, the co-writer, certainly shows the flair he developed when editing Monty Python as the movie has that same taste to it of the absurd and ridiculous that Crowley often exhibited in order to shock the mundane Victorian world he had emerged from. I doubt this movie will ever be seen in mainstream movie houses in American as I can already hear those 'call to arms' by religious zealots about corrupting the youth and blasphemy, for England  it reminded me of nothing more shocking than the picture postcards one used to buy at Blackpool beach of fart jokes and double entendres :)

For, what must be, a low budget movie it has first rate production value of multi-million dollar mainstream films and the scenes of and around Trinity where Crowley once trod are quite spectacular, almost like being back there.

I give this movie five stars for two reasons, it was throughly entertaining for the whole movie (how many big budget movies can say the same?) and it managed to defeat the censor's of moral conduct who seek to 'protect us' from exercising our own free 'Will'.

3724628,5,B001NY6YQ6,"I am familiar with Crowley's work and many biographies, and so much of my pleasure watching this had to do with the inside jokes, puns, and knowing liberties taken with Crowley's work.  I would agree this really has nothing to do with Crowley's understanding of Magick.  I know for a fact it has NOTHING to do with what folks actually practice (for one thing, magic is magic, it's neither good nor evil).  What the film does very well, however, is summarize all the popular press tabloid gossip about Crowley during his time and repackage it for ours, and for this I think the film is quite enjoyable (right down to the crucified cat!). Heck, I think the film is brilliant in this respect; it really captures the campy ""fun"" Crowley himself had at the journalist's expense. Now, Crowley himself was a pretty flawed human being and did some terrible things, but this film's character should not be in any way confused with the real, historical person.  I think if followers of Crowley have a beef with this film, it would be the latter---but, ya know, I think most people who'd watch this are smart enough to know the difference. This film is simply a marvelous, fun, horror film romp that is in the tradition of Crowley's own public pranks.  I would disagree with the reviewers, then, that the Beast wouldn't like this.  I think he'd be giggling with perverse glee (if not gleet).  I think, in other words, folks who have merely dabbled in Thelema, as well as those who are well versed, will enjoy this film.  It has surprisingly good production values, and the over-the-top campy acting made me grin throughout.  (The scarlet woman actress is simply delicious, too).  I also like the fact it goes for atmosphere instead of gore.  This is an ""occult thriller"" more in the tradition of Polanski's THE NINTH GATE than, say, SAW or similar schlock; in other words, it's more of a heady/intellectual thrill than a shock-fest, including plenty of British humor (a smoking turd on a professor's desk, for example).  What I don't know is if this kind of film appeals to the die-hard horror fan who doesn't know a lot about Crowley---probably not.  I've spent hours trying to make sense of Crowley's writings, and so the pay off for me was the laughter (the film pokes fun at Crowley as much as it celebrates his sense of humor). Hope this helps some of you decide if you should rent or buy! It's pretty campy, very British, and very loose with Crowley's actual writings. I bought it and loved it, and will be watching it again soon.",1238976000,10,2525,4.647191011235955
3724629,5,B001NY6YQ6,"I really liked this movie, especially the music!  Bruce's 'Man of sorrows' at the end, is excellent.  If you pay attention to the dialogue and DVD links, there is quite enough information on what Crowley thought. The point was, I believe, not to give the feel of a biography (thankfully), but to have fun in the spirit of Crowley and still give some fundamental information.  Bruce did a great job!",1238803200,3,398,4.6571428571428575
3724630,4,B001NY6YQ6,"First of all I have to give this film at least three stars simply because it isn't a remake or a sequel.  That makes it a rather amazing and rare horror film these days.

It is sad that a feature film about the life of Aleister Crowley has never been made.  Certainly this film does not remedy the situation.  The plot is a mess and the script is silly but the cast is superb (especially Simon Callow) and it is directed with flair and style.  There are many wonderful Crowley details scattered throughout the film but it seems as if the screenwriters (Julian Doyle and Bruce Dickinson) read EVERYTHING they could find on Crowley and then couldn't remember any of it accurately.

The DVD contains a good looking print of the film with an unexceptional Dolby 5.1 audio track.  The disc is packed with extras including several deleted scenes (which NEEDED to be deleted as none are entertaining).  There is a documentary on the making of the film that manages to insult the intelligence of the viewer by trying to conjure up spooky goings on during the film making process.  The commentary track with Bruce Dickinson, Ben Timlet and Julian Doyle often sounds like the members of SPINAL TAP trying to sound like they know what they are talking about and getting all sorts of facts wrong on every subject they attempt to speak about (the Bible, Crowley history, quantum physics etc.).  They sound like the type of people who believe the DaVINCI CODE is historical fact.  In fact just about everyone who opens their mouths in the documentary or commentary track manages to spew out nothing more than misinformation (these folks inform us that it is a HISTORICAL FACT that Jesus Christ was born on January 6, although virtually all historians and theologians confirm that the birth date of Jesus is unknown).  Such oddball statements go on and on and on during the documentary and commentary.

Having said all of this, I must admit that I was very much entertained by the film. It was a lot of fun, although it made no sense whatsoever.  Most Crowley enthusiasts will get a kick out of it.  Perhaps at some point someone will attempt a serious film about the life of Crowley.  Lets hope it isn't Michael Bay.",1238198400,2,2202,4.651162790697675
3724631,2,B001NY6YQ6,"I won't bother to recap the plot of this movie in my review, because many other reviewers have done that quite nicely already. All I will say is that this movie could have been really great. There were lots of scientific theories and deep subject matter in the contents of the story.. There were moments in the script that could have launched this tale into new levels of weird and satanic creepiness.

HOWEVER... the deeper subject matter is a little skimmed over, and the machine that actually allowed Crowley's spirit to possess a University Professor should have been explained in more detail. The story got jumbled after while and we saw too much of reincarneted Crowley just walking around, doing clever swearing and urinating on people. Maybe the writers tried to cram too much into the script by trying to be too deep and blasphemous. But instead of creating a movie that was an attention getter that left an impression.. the end result was a movie that could have been great, but felt rushed, a little shallow in parts, and leaving the viewer waiting for something awesome to happen and it never does. I appreciated parts of this movie and bits of it stuck in my head. But I don't think it was enough to carry the movie over the top.  I will perhaps watch this DVD again some day, because maybe it is like some of those metal albums that grow on you after two or three listens and then you think its superb. And seeing how Bruce Dickenson co-wrote the script.. maybe it is just a just a masterpeice waiting to soak in.",1238112000,3,1527,4.549090909090909
3724632,3,B001NY6YQ6,"This film has about as much to do with what Crowley was about as the tabloid newspapers in his own day who accused him of plotting to steal the towers of Notre Dame or sacrificing babies in Sicily. The least they could have done was to have the main character actually performing one of Crowley's own ritual invocations, almost all of which are in print or available on line. Instead they have him shouting gibberish and acting like a hopped-up Marquis de Sade with a Cambridge degree. If they thought they were enhancing some understanding of his belief in reincarnation by mixing things up with that techno-wizardry that is supposed to bring Crowley back to life, then they failed. It has nothing to do with reincarnation or what Crowley believed in at all. The Scarlet Woman routine with the redhaired 'journalist' doesn't come anywhere near to enlightening us on what the Babalon magick was meant for. Why didn't they follow some of the quite clear statements in Crowley's own magical workings? It's as if the moviemakers read some popular stuff on Crowley and thought hey that's cool and weird and hey what the heck we can work with this! Moreover the gibberish in the movie at ""key"" moments is not even audible since the background noise and music, as with all digitalized disks, overwhelms and distorts the dialogue. More evidence of a less human life through digital technology!
Forget this movie. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of Book Four instead.",1237939200,4,1462,4.782608695652174
3724633,3,B001NY6YQ6,"When you're into horror flicks, metal music or just anything on the bizarre side, it's pretty much inevitable that some day you'll hear about Aleister Crowley.  Whether or not you decide to dig further to find out more about the man is of course your own decision, but most of us have a very general idea about who the man was.  Personally, he never fascinated me all that much, so my knowledge on how historically accurate this film is, is rather slim.
Naturally I was drawn to this because of Bruce Dickinson's involvement with the script.
The story is about a nerdy, stuttering college professor who becomes possessed by the reincarnated spirit of Aleister Crowley through some experimental virtual reality type claptrap.  He loses his stutter, shaves his head, urinates on his students and kills people.  Basically he's an out of control and unpleasant guy, but he does have an agenda.  He wants to perform a ""Chemical Wedding""(new remaster edition now available on Sanctuary records), which is similar to the immaculate conception...but a bit more on the evil side.  His aim is to create a ""Moonchild""(Hear the mandrake screeeeeeeeeeeeaaaam, YOW!!).  He needs a redhead to pull this off, and it just so happens that out leading lady and love interest to the hero is....a redhead!  The hero, teamed up with some old acquaintances of Crowley's, race against the clock to stop Mr. Crowley(what went on in your head....oops, wrong band).  Along the way Crowley endlessly rants and chants, conducts an orgy(with golden shower), whacks off while being whipped(with ejaculation), takes a dump on a desk, and shaves a prostitute's crotch.
This wasn't a bad movie, I just thought it was rather blah, unexciting and cliched.  Granted, this might be totally my fault considering I never found it's subject very interesting or creepy.  Dickinson's script is packed with scientific mumbo jumbo and Crowley's spiritual mumbo jumbo, but as a storyteller, it's pretty by the numbers as far as supernatural thrillers go.  As I said before, I'm not sure of the historical accuracy, but it seems to me that the Crowley in this film is based more around his public reputation and the legends and stereotypes rather than the real guy.  But I'd still have to recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in Crowley(there certainly aren't many films out there that use him as the subject, so the pickins are slim), or those who like sorcery, sex, and time travel/parallel universe themes.
I love you to death, Bruce, but don't quit your day job.",1237680000,2,2532,4.929411764705883
3724634,4,B001NY6YQ6,"From the mind and imagination of Bruce Dickinson comes a film ""based on real events dramatized for entertainment.""  Okay, that's what the credits say at least.  What we can say is Crowley is a deeply disturbing film that, if it is based on a `true' story, then it must have been one heck of a true story.

 The death of the notorious occultist, Aleister Crowley in 1947 was the end of a life spent in debauchery, sadism, moral degradation, and sexual excess.  His dedication to the mystic arts and study of mystic texts was legendary.  Two visiting Cambridge students, Symons and Victor,  witness the unholy death of Crowley after he reads about L Ron Hubbard and Jack Parsons and Moonchild.  53 years later, Dr Mathers brings a super cooled suit  to be hooked up to the Z93 supercomputer, only to find out that Oliver Haddo, a mild mannered classics professor, has been transformed into a re-incarnated Crowley ready to wreak havoc on campus!  The college newspaper wants a story on Dr Joshua Mathers, and their crack reporter, Lia, is drawn into a web of murder and demonic forces.  ""The Beast"" lives in Haddo, and through him, evil runs free.  Ritual murders, sadistic  practises, and intense sexual perversion explode on the campus.  Crowley/Haddo desperately wants the chemical wedding described in his early writing, and Lia is his chosen.  Mathers enters the `other' world and through a familiar object, the watch of Crowley, defeats him and changes the world.

Truly, this is one disturbing film.  Bruce Dickinson and Julian Doyle  are to be congratulated on their successful, horror film .  Many new products in the genre do not make the grade, yet this one manages to repulse viewers, and yet make  you hang on to watch.  The orgy scene....what can you say.  Wicked (and not in a good way either).  Crowley/Haddo masturbating to the summons made me wonder why I was watching this.  Simon Callow is a remarkable madman/hell sent professor.
With Dickinson writing the film, I expected more Maiden/heavy metal during the film.  He did restrain his work, and what does make it to film is good.  If this is a B grade film, then Stephen King is a hack!

If you like horror films, you will enjoy this, right to the depths of your scared soul.

3724635,3,B001NY6YQ6,"Full marks to Bruce Dickinson for making a feature film on Crowley, but it is tacky. Simon Callow puts in a brilliant performance as a character based on Crowley. There are some funny plays on words which Crowley readers will enjoy, like the ZX 93 computer, Haddo being a Crowley nom de plume, etc.

Crowley wasn't quite that beastly and although he loved to dress up in weird costumes, I don't think his tastes stretched to that appalling pink suit! I don't recall that ever peed of his audience or left excrement as a calling card.

All very amusing in a Hammer horror sort of way, but don't expect a serious portrayal of the Master Therion.",1237161600,13,643,4.5344827586206895
3724636,2,B001NY6YQ6,"if your not familiar with crowley's name or his catch phrases, you have them burned into your brain by the end of this mess.  the movie was written by bruce dickinson, of iron maiden.  it has a ken russell over-the-top feel to it.  ""crowley"" solely focuses on the extreme popular images that the media has endeared to him.  the movie tries to be blasphemous with depravities of urination, rape, orgy and murder.  because it tries so hard to be bad, if fails at it's attempt.  the nudity is brief and not very good.  crowley was a complicated man and this movie shows him at his shallowest.  the movie captures every negative stereotype and none of his depth or brilliance.  the soundtrack is a mess too, as halfway through the movie an iron maiden song comes on, blaring, drowning out the scene's dialogue.  it's unfortunate that a movie about crowley has not been made before this.  it's also unfortunate that this movie is being the one offered.  i'm sure this review will not hinder all the teenage wanna-be's and metal heads from buying it.  there'll be plenty of used copies to go around after a single viewing of it.  would crowley like it?  yes, because he'd get more public exposure, then he'd like it again as he'd sue again for defamation of character which would put him in the limelight again.  don't like my review?  check out Rue Morgue's issue 88 and read theirs.",1237161600,6,1378,4.604938271604938

1. A school teacher offers himself to be used in a transformation project
2. He becomes Aleister Crowley
3. The school goes through a real crazy time
4. Things get freaky

Me being a Bruce Dickinson fan to the max, I decided to rent this film after being excited about it finally being released here. Originally released in the UK as ""Chemical Wedding"", The film is about Professor Haddo, a bumbling teacher who offers himself for a transformation experiment and soon becomes possessed by Aleister Crowley, which soon turns the school (and the town) upside down.

This film is a pretty cool movie, but incredibly flawed one. It was Co-written by Bruce Dickinson and directed by Julian Doyle, and stars Simon Callow as Haddo, turning in his best performance. We also get a brief glimpse into Crowley before his death (played by John Shrapnel), and a cameo by Brucey himself (as the guy with thick rimmed glasses at the beginning).

There are lots of flaws though. The film feels really rushed, I wanted to sort of know more about Crowley's life in general. There's a bit too much sex in this film- I know Crowley believed in sexual magic, but did we really need that sweaty orgy scene? They could have implied it instead of making it like 8 minutes long. And I'll admit the effects were a bit cheesy, but then again this IS a low budget movie.

Anyways, this film is worth it for the finale alone despite the cheesy special effects. This is a pretty good movie, but be aware... this is definitely not for everyone.",1236988800,17,1550,4.642335766423358
