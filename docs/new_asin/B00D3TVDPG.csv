8589215,1,B00D3TVDPG,I am very unhappy with this purchase. I was under the impression that it was a 3 DVD collection. Thats what it said when I ordered it. I opened up my package to find the DVD in a cracked cheap clear DVD case.  I would never of paid almost $25 for one DVD when amazon has plenty of others for a lot cheaper. There's no contact number for this company. Everything is through email. I sent them an email and they responded back to me with a short rude email. I am very upset and will NEVER buy from Twisterfitness again!,1393718400,3,517,4.118811881188119

8589217,3,B00D3TVDPG,I like upbeat Zumba classes and was hoping to get that same experience at home. This Zumba video is pretty slow motion and not the workout that I was looking for.,1390348800,,162,4.258064516129032
