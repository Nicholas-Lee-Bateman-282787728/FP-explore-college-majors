1083466,5,6305838577,"I enjoyed this movie a lot.  The actors are all good in their roles, especially Adam Beach.  The plot has a different twist and you will be surprised by the ending.",1354147200,5,164,4.258064516129032
1083467,3,6305838577,"It was an awesome price for a DVD but the price of shipping was way over the top. The Movie itself was not bad, I only bought it to see Rose McGowans early work.",1332028800,,161,3.764705882352941
1083468,3,6305838577,Movie was great.  Kept you guessing who was the killer amongst the people stranded in the mountain storm.  Family loved it. We watch it when family come over.  Enjoy Native American actors (Adam Beach).,1124323200,,202,4.882352941176471
1083469,3,6305838577,"Most of the opinions on this movie are mixed, either it's a ***** classic or a * DUD.  The truth is it's just a solid little movie that doesn't really stand out either way.
A group of mismatched travellers are snowed-in in the Rocky Mountains.  An officer (Adam Beach) stumbles across a bloody room and two of the hotel customers are missing.  Since no one can come or go, he reasons that one of the travellers is the killer.  The film scuttles along from there as most of these films do.
The characters are mostly irritating stereo-types - the black trucker with a shady past who's set his life straight, two redneck brothers, a bimbo, and a sleazy guy who would play Chuck Woolery's evil twin if they starred in a soap opera.  Also along for the ride is Rose McGowan as a woman who's just passing through -- or is she? A poor-but-honest hotel keeper -- or is he?  And a kid who is autistic -- or is he?  Okay.  He is.
The one thing that keeps me from rating this higher is some of the dialogue.  One-liners fall flat time after time and as the villain is trying to escape in a Snow-Cat he keeps delivering corny phrases apparently to keep himself amused.  I hate that!
If you thought Joyride and Jeepers Creepers were ***** affairs this might be a good movie for you, but if you're looking for nuanced examples of characters clashing against one another pick up Hitchcock's Lifeboat instead.
Mildly recommended.",1018915200,21,1413,4.484375
1083470,5,6305838577,This movie was a real treat for me. Rose McGowan is my favourite actress of all time. She plays a great part in this movie as Nancy. Adam Beach also plays a good part here. The movie focuses on the dead of winter. It is freezing cold outside and everyone is becoming agressive. It doesn't help that their is a lunatic going about killing people. I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes suspence and light horror.,1016409600,2,415,4.402597402597403
1083471,1,6305838577,"It's a pity that such a beautiful, talented actress as Rose McGowan was wasted in this pitiful, boring waste of film. The plot is weak, unoriginal, and laughable, while the acting is beyond atrocious. Whoever did the casting in this movie needs a brainscan. Adam Beach was terrible, comical even!, as the stranded state trooper. Throw in a tough black dude, a womanizing creep, and 2 drunken losers and what you have is the Last Stop...oh yeah, don't forget to add the corpse into the plot for an additional comical element. DO NOT buy this movie. Don't even rent it. You were warned.",1007078400,,584,4.679611650485437
1083472,2,6305838577,"I give Rose McGowan some sort of credit< one star is on her behalf>, but, geez, no one put any effort into this movie as far as acting! The lead  character is mighty horrible. He made Rosie look bad. I fart on his grave!  . I fell asleep after 30 min. , but eventually watched the rest out of  boredom< and the fact that i cant let ANY movie go unfinished>. THE  PRICE IS RIDICULOUS!  DONT BUY IT!RENT IT!Use the 100 dollars you might  have used for crack... it's more worth it.",967161600,,478,4.141304347826087
1083473,4,6305838577,"It has it's plot holes, but The Last Stop is a brilliant little piece of indie filmmaking! A group of people get trapped in a motel during a snowstorm, and you guessed it: one of them is a killer! lol. Rose McGowan  is a fantastic actress who's going to make it BIG! Her chilling, emotional  character (Nancy) was what kept me drawn to this film. Well worth the  purchase, if you're into independent thrillers.  Certainly an improvement  on other efforts (Phantoms for example).",961891200,7,478,4.710843373493976

1083570,3,6305838577,Spotty; the beginning and the ending are much too predictable. Sandwiched in between are some taught scenes with solid performances. Ms. Maggio's tinny voice is a distraction.,1475971200,,175,5.518518518518518
