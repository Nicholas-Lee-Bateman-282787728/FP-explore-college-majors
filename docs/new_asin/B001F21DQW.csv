During lecture, we were learning about invertebrates, and I remembered the time when my grandpa and I caught a mole in the garden.  To this day I remember how waxy/soft the moles fur was (we let him go).  Then I remembered the Mole in the car.  After lecture I knew I had to find the cartoon.  I browsed the internet hoping to find something, and I found this DVD.  I did not think a DVD would exist for this cartoon..it blew my expectations.

I put the DVD into the computer (residence United States, should work on the tv too) and a menu came up.  All the individual Mole episodes were listed, or that is what I think.  I only have a few Mole episodes recorded on VHS; I did not expect this many episodes, or all the episodes..which is awesome.  I watched one episode (watch more over Holidays) and the picture quality is great, the sound quality is great, its a great DVD.

Thank you Serge for selling this DVD.  Fantastic seller.  Surpassed my expectations.  I received an email from him/her saying the package was sent (big +).  Shipment is fast, I received the package in less than a week.  Thank you for restoring a piece of my memory.  If you are looking for the Mole cartoon, this DVD is it.",1418428800,,1256,4.344827586206897
8300594,5,B001F21DQW,"I miss information about DVD Region Code. I bought another Krtec DVD with region code 2 (which is the code used in Norway).  I learned that some DVD players can be changed to suit all region codes. The person whom I gave this DVD to, had this flexible DVD player. Luckily ! Because those films about the Mole, are so funny, so precise about different personalities, the music is so nice and I hope it will still be possible to get them for as long as possible!",1389139200,,460,4.287356321839081

8300596,5,B001F21DQW,"I loved these animations as a kid and my own kids love them too. I encourage American viewers to give this DVD a try - there are no words in these shorts, just quirky sounds, so it doesn't matter what language you speak. Themes (nature, friendship, adventures) are appropriate for very yound kids but clever enough for older ones as well. I watched adventures of the mole and his friends with great pleasure.

DVD Quality is good with sharp picture and good sound.",1298592000,,464,4.590361445783133
8300597,5,B001F21DQW,"The Mole, no words, just cute sounds... my boys loved it... age 2-4 love it specially, but when my 2 old one watches them the 6 old one still enjoys them (just complains saying that he already saw this and that :))

Would be nice to get the whole series on 1 blue-ray in the future!! Would love to get some recommendations for cartoons in this style.",1261353600,,350,4.223880597014926
8300598,5,B001F21DQW,"Sweet and eternal. A series of animated shorts out of the Czech republic, these timeless gems deserve to be as widely known and celebrated as the works of Hans Christian Anderson. Mole is the classic un-hero who by the sheer power of innocence and with a little help from his friends consistently thwarts and disarms the tyrant and the bully. He does so with sweet, poignant, light-hearted humor and grace. The stories are allegorical and Mole is a kind of national archetype for the outgunned, dauntless, creative Czechs who found little ways to undermine the Soviet occupation. I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.",1253404800,,622,4.990384615384615
