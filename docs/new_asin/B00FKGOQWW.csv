Not quite the high standard of the first season, but tremendously mind-bending episodes non the less.",1417824000,,273,5.088888888888889

5994721,5,B00FKGOQWW,"The second series is even better than the first! I'm surprised there is only one review on  Amazon! This series is extremely inspiring, dark, intellectual, and very well done.  Also, people are raving about the film HER, and that film could fit into the Black Mirror series. I went to see HER and thought of Black Mirror the entire time. lol

Our future relationship with technology, and social media is bleak.",1390089600,8,410,4.746478873239437
5994722,5,B00FKGOQWW,"Watching old Twilight Zone episodes on Netflix, I often imagine how people in the '60s must have felt watching such an intellectually stimulating, fantastical, and thought-provoking sci-fi/social commentary show.  Compared with the standard fare at the time, I guess it must have been pretty mind-blowing for mainstream audiences.

Except I don't have to imagine, because Black Mirror fits that bill to a T for the modern viewer. Indeed, the name of the series really tells it all - it's black (as in dark, moody, and sometimes very bleak) and it's a mirror held up to the technological obsessions and social foibles of today.  This show is razor-sharp and if it doesn't give you pause about your own relationship to technology, you're either a luddite or deeply obtuse.

I'm still haunted by the episode White Bear a year later...",1389312000,13,831,5.0

8616335,2,B00FKGOQWW,I liked nothing about this series whatsoever.  Thought I'd give it a try after hearing raves about it.  Very disappointed.,1477612800,,122,5.05

""Be Right Back"" is a deeply moving story of a woman devastated when her lover is killed in a car accident.  Unable to move forward in her life, her best friend tries to help by hiring a company that uses all the on line communications your loved one ever created to let you 'stay in touch'  through messages with the departed.

Rather than descending into the obvious 'internet gone mad' scarefest, this is a heartbreaking meditation on loss, holding on, letting go and the nature of love.  Quite profound, and wonderfully acted.

""White Bear"" is one of the most successful cases of capturing what it feels like to be inside a nightmare I've seen in quite a while.  A young woman wakes to find herself chased by very scary violent people while other people stand around and watch or photograph it.  She has no idea why she is being hunted, or how to get away.  Simple, but extremely well done.  The pay-off twists didn't blow me away, but everything leading up to them was first rate and truly frightening film-making.

""The Waldo Moment"".  Switching gears completely, this is a pretty sharp political satire.  A cartoon bear - a popular figure with a late night talk show - regularly interviews politicians, and is loved for the way he exposes their hypocrisies.  But things get ever stranger when - as a publicity stunt - the ""Waldo"" the bear actually runs for office.  Personally I found this the weakest of the pieces.  It was easier to get out in front of in terms of both plot twists and underlying ideas.  But it's still well done and never less than interesting, with some important (if not surprising) comments about the toxic mix that has arisen through the mating of media, entertainment and politics.",1457049600,,1769,4.65483870967742
8616338,5,B00FKGOQWW,"As others have said, it is Twilight Zone inspired with a 21st Century spin. The writing and acting are magnificent. The new TV Series ""Humans"" seems to be similar and inspired by Black Mirror? I have noticed great things in television coming out of Britain lately i.e. The Fall (Gillian Anderson), Black Mirror, etc. Mad Men (Jon Hamm fans) need to see the White Christmas episode from Black Mirror! The stories all involve the dark side of too much technology. I love this series. Just can't get enough! And take it from me folks, many drama TV series with over the top harshy ""brit accents"" turn me off i.e. Turn, Rome, Game of Thrones. But the aforementioned are genius, I can understand the actors speaking and I love it.",1436572800,,725,4.627906976744186
8616339,4,B00FKGOQWW,4 stars because I am American and i want MORE ! I need 8 or more episodes in one season :),1432857600,,90,3.3333333333333335
8616340,5,B00FKGOQWW,"Brilliant Show! I wish there were more of it. I actually watched these streaming on Netflix - once I started, I couldn't stop watching until I'd gone through the first and second seasons. Completely sums up my thoughts on where we are heading as a society.",1426982400,,256,4.586956521739131
8616341,5,B00FKGOQWW,"Another season of technology gone spectacularly awry. Creepy. Inspired. Repulsive. Genre-defying.

 ""Be Right Back"": What starts as a heartrending story quickly turns into one of false hope, yet with an ambiguous but emotionally satisfying ending. This segment caught me off guard, and is the ep. that earns Series 2 a 5th star. It is what the feature film ""Transcendence"" should have been... and ""Be Right Back"" is more likely to happen in the 21st century than ""Transcendence.""

 ""The Waldo Moment"": Every season has its lesser episodes, even when the season is only a trio of them. Still, ""The Waldo Moment"" is, if not prescient, then in the least a scenario that could almost unfold in contemporary politics.

 ""White Bear"": Disturbing, but in a thought-provoking way, this will keep you glued to the screen even through the closing credits.

 Spoiler Alert  The following is commentary about ""White Bear"" that indirectly reveals the plot:

I found ""White Bear"" to be particularly interesting because I sometimes read comments posted in response to web news stories about botched executions in the US. There seems to be a breed of folk in the US (certainly not isolated to the US) who are of the opinion that botched executions are good, and that the condemned deserve much worse than the suffering they endure in a botched execution. I am sometimes taken aback by how bloodthirsty people are (vengeance and justice apparently are easily confused). Anyway, ""White Bear"" is a chilling reminder of why a civilized society does not condone cruel and unusual punishment (or in this case, a technologically-induced living hell that will only end when the psychological torture causes physiological failure or an absolute mental breakdown). What is truly chilling to me is knowing that there are people who today would be delighted if criminal justice systems employed ""White Bear"" tactics.",1423872000,2,1888,5.140522875816994
