553835,2,6303058876,"The following review was written by my 10-year-old son:

In 1963, they created the Daleks. Everyone enjoyed the killer robots. I enjoy episodes with Daleks. The Resurrection of the Daleks was barely a dalek episode. It was a Davros episode. Daleks are better without Davros. You don't focus on the robots you have loved since 1963 in Davros episodes. You focus on the crazy, madman/psychopath that you've loved since 1974. I had heard Davros screaming in my dreams. And at one part of the episode, I couldn't even understand what Davros was saying because he was yelling like crazy! One last bad thing before we move onto the only good parts of this episode. At one part it was some guy saying ""The daleks are using Sphinzes' laboratory!"". Here's what I thought when I heard that. Who is Sphinzes? Good Parts: It was a nice and touching moment when Tegan left. Also, I like spies. And Dalek spies are even better. Still, Revelation of the Daleks I think will be a nice Davros episode. Now that's my mystery. Well that's it. Best wishes and goodbye Tegan!",1398470400,,1054,4.666666666666667
553836,5,6303058876,This episode was one of the better Davidson as Dr Who shows he played in.  The Daleks are the best villain in the series and he does not disappoint his dealings with them.

553838,5,6303058876,"This is a two Disk selection.  I think the most special feature is that on one disk we find the traditional half hour segments as broadcast in England while on the other we find the Americanized edition where the show has been compressed to two one hour shows.

As far as I am concerned that makes this edition worth my hard earned cash right there.  But wait there is more.

The Special Features selection offers:

  Come in Number Five,Hosted by David Tennant A look at the tenure of the 5th Doctor Peter Davison.  We even get a peek at a short he did with David Tennant called 'Time Crash'  Seems this was done for a charity event.  I would love to be able to purchase it.

  Tomorrow's Times, Mostly a talking head stringing unrelated comments together in order to get a paycheck.

  Walrus, A short featuring a Dalek and a Welsh girl.

553904,5,6303058876,"I bought this partially because I'm a completist and this finishes up my Five Doctor run, and partially because it's a damn good story, full of suspense and tragedy, and the departure of a companion I initially didn't like, but grew to love.  I like that, after all she's been through, The Daleks are the one thing that finally drives Tegan away.  Five's been fighting them for so long, I doubt he even things about what they look like to an outsider.  And Turlough, who's an alien himself, and who, as we find out in the next episode, has been through his own traumatic experiences, just takes them in stride as more of The Doctor's strangeness.  Her departure is one of the most human and heartbreaking, scenes in the episode, and it's also one of those times that you see how truly alien The Doctor is.  He's saddened, yes, but he can't quit understand why now.  The Doctor tends to act so human most of the time, it's fascinating when you get these little glimpses into who he rally is. For him, this is SOP.  He's been fighting these things across the universe for as long as he can remember.  He hates them, because he's only too aware of the damage they can do, but he also knows they have to fought and stopped again and again, and that it's going to fall to him (and whoevers with him) to stop them. That they might find this traumatizing and want to leave never really occurs to him. Not because he's bad, but because when you get right down to it, he's an alien.  This is what he does.  And while he knows there are going to be casualties and people will die and leave, he never really stops to think about those moments.",1362873600,9,1632,4.356435643564357

553906,3,6303058876,"I'm not at all keen on these 'Special Edition' DVD's that the BBC and 2|Entertain have been using to milk the Doctor Fan's goodwill (and wallets) over the past few years. The release of a 'Special Edition of The Seeds of Death' is a particular nadir. However, that issues' companion release 'Resurrection of the Daleks' does have something to offer, although arguably, not at the price being demanded. Issued with all of the original DVD release material, there is some new stuff here that's quite worthy. A new commentary for one, plus a look at the careers of some of the guest cast are two interesting developments. The stand out feature though is a new 50 minute documentary looking at the entire Peter Davison era as the Fifth Doctor. This is truly a fascinating documentary. Of course, it should have been included on 'The Caves of Androzani: Special Edition' a while back, but that would have stopped the BBC gouging the fans twice had they done it that way. It makes more sense for it to be on that release, but I don't entirely object to it being here as I did find it very interesting. It's debatable whether it's worth $35 on top of the $35 for the original release, but that all depends on your budget and perspective. 2|Entertain rely on the fact that Doctor Who fans will buy anything at all with the words ""Doctor Who"" printed on it, so it's a personal choice as to whether the investment is worth it. More ""Special Editions"" are planned of course, including several in the Pertwee era, some of which have not yet been announced but are certainly in the works. They won't admit it yet, but there will be a ""Special Edition"" of 'Invasion of the Dinosaurs' coming once they've fixed the colour issues. Quite why we need an 'Inferno' or 'Claws of Axos' ""Special Edition"" is beyond me completely. I'd rather the fans boycotted these releases in order to show the BBC we're not as stupid as they think, but I'm torn as this particular Dalek release does have good new material. I just think it should be cheaper than the original DVD. It wouldn't seem quite so cynical then. Who's up for ""Talons of Weng Chiang Extra Special 4 DVD Box Set Edition""? You can count on it.",1340668800,7,2179,4.561224489795919
553907,4,6303058876,"The TARDIS inexplicably takes the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough to the planet Earth, present-day (meaning 1984) London, England to be exact. But it's a trap set up by the Daleks.

Lots of things are going on. The Daleks want to free Davros from his suspended animation prison ship, orbiting Earth (in the future, but Daleks can travel time, too). (Davros had been arrested after losing to the Doctor, played by Tom Baker, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Destiny-of-the-Daleks-Story-104/dp/B000Z7G87C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Destiny of the Daleks (Story 104)</a>.)

Throughout time, the Daleks have had a love-hate relationship with their insane creator, but right now they need Davros. The Movellans, a race of androids, have created a virus that kills Daleks, so the Daleks need Davros to find a cure.

That's in the future. In the current day, the Daleks create doppleganger human androids, to take over powerful positions on Earth. In addition, they plan to duplicate the Doctor and his companions and use them to assassinate the Gallifreyan High Council, hence the trap. But what if you create a robot duplicate so good at acting human that it can fool other humans, and then it continues on to start to feel human itself?

This is not a favorite episode but it's not a terrible one, either. The part I most do not appreciate is when the Doctor picks up a gun and shoots an android doppleganger. [A Comment pointed out that I am incorrect; It is a mutant Dalek that Dr Who shoots.] That just isn't the classic doctor I know and love. Tegan calls him on this violence, and the Doctor muses, ""It seems I must mend my ways"". On the other hand, the Doctor has the chance to kill Davros, ending his terrorizing once and for all, but cannot do it.

""The Resurrection of the Daleks"" was first issued in DVD in 2003 in the U.S. This review is of the ""Special Edition"" issued 2012.

553908,3,6303058876,"This title would have been better titled ""Let The Bodies Hit The Floor"" since the body count is the highest I have ever seen in any Doctor Who adventure. That aside, the storyline is a bit of a cluster with there being many characters involved, however they drop off like flies once the daleks appear.  I find something new on repeat viewings which is what I like about DW.  Davros is in true maniac form and Peter Davison gives an average performance as the Doctor. This is Tegan's farewell story and she does leave abruptly in my opinion.  I believe if her exit would have been foreshadowed somewhere in the middle of the story or maybe drawn out a little longer to give it more of a lasting effect on the viewer.  Oh well, what do I know.  I'm just a fan. I recommend this story if you are a hardcore dalek, davros, and Peter Davison fan.  A very clustered and violent tale mixed in with some decent acting, I say its pretty good.",1276646400,,933,4.333333333333333
553909,5,6303058876,"While I am not a fan of Davros I find it amusing that the Daleks themselves were not really too happy about rescuing the mad scientist.  Even if he was their creator they have finally started to understand that he is a few sandwiches short of a picnic basket.  If you know what I mean.
Lots of action, clones, time travel and lots of bloody combat scenes.  Also this DVD has some very interesting extras, some from 1984 and 1986 plus commentary from Peter Davison and Janet Fielding.  Really enjoyed the deleted or extended scenes and always enjoy hearing about the events behind the scenes.  It is always fun to know what they wanted and what they ended up with because of funding issues and bad luck.",1237420800,,702,4.496062992125984

553912,4,6303058876,"It was great reliving this one. What more can you say when Davros and the daleks make an appearance with the fifth doctor, Peter Davison. Very classic episode that adds to the story of the doctor's greatest enemy.",1202428800,,213,4.631578947368421
553927,3,6303058876,"Whoa, there! Here we are nearly at the end of Peter Davison's last season as the Doctor, and he's never had a good proper Dalek story! Who's responsible for this oversight? Anyway, whip one up in a hurry before he's out the door!--I'm not sure if this indeed actually reflects the thinking behind ""Resurrection of the Daleks"" but I wouldn't be surprised, for it bears many of the telltale traces of a rush job. Whatever the case, mixed results are what we get: Some aspects of this story are truly spectacular, some are spectacularly awful, and these extremes kind of average out into a reasonably okay but admittedly mediocre tale of the Doctor and his trademark villains.

The story as a whole is overloaded with several different plotlines any one of which would've been great but mashed together they just make a bit of an inconsistent mess, leaving unclear just what precisely the Daleks are trying to accomplish here (Invade Earth? Rescue Davros? Use him to biologically engineer a new batch of Daleks? Strike back against the Movellans? Kill the Doctor? Use him to take over Gallifrey? Exterminate anything that moves? Boost BBC ratings?) As for Davros, he shouldn't be here at all. His death at the end of ""Genesis of the Daleks"" was one of the dramatic masterpieces of ""Doctor Who"" history, and having him survive (first in ""Destiny of the Daleks"" and now here) sort of cheapens that in retrospect, not to mention subjecting the character to the law of diminishing returns both in terms of acting (from Michael Wisher's subtle and convincing performance to Terry Molloy's almost unintentionally comical ranting fest) and special effects (the new mask looks rubbery and fake compared to the original--I don't demand great effects from this show, but they at least shouldn't be devolving on that score!). As for the Doctor, he's almost a superfluous character for much of the story (not good for a protagonist, usually), that is until close to the end when he resolves to assassinate Davros so as to prevent his effecting the Daleks' resurrection (?). Vowing not to make the mistake of hesitating again (like he did in ""Genesis""), he sets off with laser rifle in hand to do the job right this time...and then hesitates!!! You almost have to agree with Davros that that's a pretty weak showing. Oh, but wait, then he gleefully kills off a bunch of Daleks in a clear act of germ warfare: So guns are bad but weapons of mass destruction are okay? Or the Doctor doesn't mind taking your life if you aren't recognizably humanoid? Hhmmm, we have some pretty muddled morality here, less characteristic of the Doctor's character than of careless and hurried writing.

For all that, though, it's the Daleks after all, and there's just something about them that tends to make them great villains even when they're unconvincingly multitasking several masterplans. Certainly they're deadlier than ever here--or so it seems. Actually they've always been wickedly deadly, but that quality has always been indicated and portrayed according to the standards and tastes of the changing times, and here it's depicted in a gritty, realistic, mature manner more in line with contemporary sensibilities. They don't just screech ""Exterminate!"", they do exterminate, readily and ruthlessly--hardly any of the supporting cast survives, and several are taken out by some kind of disintegrative nerve gas of Dalek design in what must be one of the gruesomest effects I've ever seen on the show. ""Doctor Who"" has grown up a bit, gotten real, and in terms of dramatic impact it works. All of this also gives substance and depth to Tegan's emotional overload from all the senseless deaths and makes her tearful decision to leave the Tardis meaningful, and Janet Fielding's moving performance at the conclusion really brings this out perfectly. Overall the story benefits from fine acting by the regulars and excellent directing: individual scenes are very memorable (the part where the Doctor and some soldiers are poking about in an old warehouse trying to find a Dalek mutant out of its shell is superbly creepy and suspenseful), the battle scenes are excitingly dynamic, and the location shots are appropriately moody and atmospheric. So much so that it's mostly after the fact that you realize none of it really holds together very tightly storywise. Yes, it could've been a lot better and probably would've been if the script editor and the writer hadn't been one and the same person (it's not an easy or enviable task to try to edit oneself, and it seldom works, even for someone as talented as Eric Saward), but so it goes I suppose. For all the glaring imperfections here, though, I'd still never hesitate to sit down and enjoy the Doctor being ""an enemy of the Daleks"" yet again. And not a moment too soon!",1184544000,2,4793,4.92336217552534

I'm not sure who is picking the stories to be released on DVD,but whoever it is, he has some weird tastes when it comes to the Davison stories.  Most of the other Doctors' DVD releases, to date, have been top-of-the-line stuff. (I'm counting the days until ""Inferno"" comes out!) But for Davison we're mostly getting the dregs.

553932,4,6303058876,"Decent ""Dr. Who"" story with the fifth incarnation of The Doctor (Peter Davidson), has The Doctor, once again, battling the show's most popular enemy, Davros & The Daleks.

The Doctor, with his companions Tegan & Turlough time travel, in the TARDIS, to the year 1984 & land in the abandoned docks of London, England, after narrowly escaping being trapped in a time corridor. After some investigating The Doctor discovers that the time corridor stint wasn't an isolated incident.

In the far future, a starship is under sudden attack by an unknown alien vessel and is taking on serious casualties. The wounded ship is boarded and the alien attackers reveal themselves to be The Daleks. The Daleks have come to retrieve their former scientist/leader, Davros, being held in a cryogenic style prison cell aboard the starship. The time corridor was produced by The Daleks in an attempt, not only to trap The Doctor, but also to retrieve a possible cure, hidden on Earth, for The Daleks & their deadly plague. Its up to The Doctor, his companions, & the survivors of the prison ship to stop The Dalek horde and Davros.

After the successful run with the fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) I lost interest with ""Doctor Who"" way back in 1981, & never really caught any of the fifth Doctor adventures (or any others for that matter). I took a leap of faith when I saw this on ""Amazon"". The problem that I had was trying to find a definitive list of the best serials of ""Doctor Who"", but, I couldn't find any. ""Resurrection Of The Daleks"" got quite a few thumbs up, so I gave it try.

With all ""Doctor Who"" shows its the stories that drive the show not the effects (still BBC cheesy) or costumes (these were really weird, & kinky, even for this show!).

Peter Davidson does a decent turn as the Doctor, but I wasn't to impressed with Tegan & especially Turlough (I was hoping he would ""TERMEENATED"" by The Daleks).

The DVD doesn't dissapoint. There are 4 different audio options. 5.1 Dolby Digital, 2.0 Dolby Stereo, Commentary w/ cast, and an isolated music score in 2.0 stereo. A look back at the making of the show & a look at the London docks today where the show was originally shot back in 1983. TARDIS Cam no. 4, is also included.

553933,2,6303058876,"Poor production values, a convoluted plot, dismal dialog and a complete lack of tension -- these are not a few of my favorite things.  It was my memory that put me off watching RESURRECTION OF THE DALEKS again.  But eventually I got around to the DVD, basically to revisit my impressions of this serial.

Unfortunately, the memory did not cheat.

The opening is fairly decent and atmospheric.  The scene of the refugees being gunned down works well as a standard action sequence.  But everything following this just looks silly.  You see, that first scene works and the following don't because of basic production values.  The first thing to do if attempting a cinema-styled action-adventure on a television budget is to hide the fact that there's no money.

I watched EARTHSHOCK recently enough that I could do a comparison.  While EARTHSHOCK occasionally suffers minor flaws because of budget, RESURRECTION looks far cheaper (and I can't imagine the actual per episode money was much different).  None of the futuristic military equipment looks like it weighs more than an ounce.  The doors look light, the walls look light, the guns look light, the debris looks light.  They try to get away with describing the space station as ""run-down"", but ""run-down"" doesn't mean ""made out of cardboard"".  One wonders why people bother taking cover behind this stuff; it looks like a good sneeze could blast through it.

That first sequence worked because there was nothing distracting from what the director was trying to achieve.  You see the policemen with machine-guns and you don't stare at them thinking, ""Gee, what a fake looking prop.  Couldn't they build something more credible?""  You just notice what you're supposed to.  This is rarely achieved again.  It's hard to blame the actors.  It's difficult to look like a hard-ass when you're hoisting around a featherweight prop gun and wearing a hat that's goofier than all get out.

It really goes downhill once the Daleks appear early in episode one and the story switches from gritty realistic battle sequences to cheaply produced sci-fi fights.  And the Daleks themselves are one of the stories bad points.  I generally like the Daleks, but I don't like them enough to care about Dalek politics.  Too much time is spent on Dalek politics; it even makes up one of the cliffhangers.  The problem here is the same one that Finn Clark insightfully mocks in his review of WAR OF THE DALEKS.  Will Davros or the Dalek Supreme rule the Dalek race?  Who cares?  We're never given any reason to invest any time worrying about the outcome.  What difference would it make if Davros is successful in his coup?  The script never bothers to tell us why this is supposed to be interesting.

And that brings us to another problem.  This is not a case of production values ruining a well-written script.  This is a script with problems, both big and small.  First of all, the plot.  Just what on Earth is going on here?  The Daleks have about half a dozen schemes going, which would be impressive if a) the plans had anything to do with each other and b) the individual schemes had any real impact.  Take the ""assassinate the High Council"" plot point.  It's brought up out of nowhere, dominates a few minutes of screen-time, and then is promptly dropped, never to be mentioned again.  None of this stuff builds on anything; there's no momentum.  It's just a series of shock moments with no structure or reason.

Small problems abound too.  There are cameras supposedly everywhere on this space station, which only seem to be working whenever the plot requires them to work.  The Doctor's coercing of Stein is similarly convoluted.  It's bad enough that the two Dalek sentries leave the room for no good reason, but they also order the troopers to leave the Doctor and Stein alone.

The two companions have very little to do in this one.  Turlough spends most of his time wandering around the space station being threatened by soldiers.  Tegan is on injured reserved, having suffered a small cut on the forehead.  These would be, perhaps, forgivable sins if not for the fact that this is Tegan's swansong.  Tegan deserved a better departure than this; she deserved a send off that wasn't so abrupt.  Nicely acted though.

As for the other characters, the serial is populated by the usual Sawardian suspects.  That is, people with no first names barking macho dialog.  I liked the practical Earth scientist.  Unfortunately, she's one of the characters that Saward doesn't know what to do with, so kills off abruptly.  Like the plot twists that have no future, characters who no longer have a point just disappear -- usually with a goofy looking special effect.

I didn't like the serial, but must admit that the DVD extras are quite good.  The commentary track is amusing, though I got a little tired of hearing director Matthew Robinson refer to everything under the sun as ""famous"".  Can someone who edits episodes of Eastenders really be considered famous?  The production text option is worthy, although it oftentimes lapses into a dry listing of other shows and movies that the actor on the screen appeared in.  The ""On Location"" mini-documentary is well done.

RESURRECTION OF THE DALEKS desires a triumph of style over substance, but unfortunately it lacks both.  It looks cheap, flimsy and shallow.  I didn't like it then; I don't like it now.  The only part of my opinion to change was that I appreciated the incidental music.  But everything else was just a mess.

Review extras (things that will probably amuse only me):

1) As the DVD commentators take pains to point out, there are quite a few ""big name"" guest stars.  I'm sure this was much more interesting to UK-based viewers.  All I could think was ""Wow, the star of 'Take A Letter, Mr. Jones' finally appears in Doctor Who!  Golly!""

2) Davros' possesses a device to turn people into obedient zombies...  Gee, that would have been handy during his trial, huh?

3) The Dalek-helmets that the troopers wear.  Goofiest hats in Doctor Who history.  And that's saying something.",1097971200,9,6074,4.835603112840467
553934,4,6303058876,"Resurrection of the Daleks is the beginning of a phasing out trilogy.  In May 1983, Peter Davison (The Doctor) decided that the upcoming season would be his last one, so scripts were rewritten to phase out Tegan, Turlough, and the Doctor.  When it happened, it took place in the last Peter Davison stories.
In 1984, a series of mysterious cylinders have been found in a London warehouse and are under investigation by Colonel Archer of the Bomb Disposal Squad.  This was also the same scene where a pair of policemen gun down all but two of a group of escaping fugitives.  The survivor, the cowardly and wounded Stien, meets the Doctor, Tegan, and Turlough, who have been dragged down to Earth by a time corridor.
In space, a group of commandos led by Lytton and some Daleks lead an attack on a space station holding Davros prisoner.  It's not too difficult, as the low morale and a lackadaisical attitude observed by recently-arrived Lieutenant Mercer lead to nearly all the crew being killed.
The seeds for the Dalek schism that would plague both remaining Dalek stories are set here, as Davros, who has been freed to help the Daleks develop an antidote to a virus that led to their defeat in a war against their foes the Movellans (q.v. Destiny Of The Daleks), has decided to create some new Daleks obedient to him and not to the Supreme Dalek.  He gains followers in his circle, including human troops, whom he conditions.  Yet, he rants and raves throughout most of this story, and at times, his dialogue is unintelligible, maybe because of microphone troubles beneath the mask or it being drowned by the music.
Interesting effects in this story is a scary scene of someone's whose face is rotting away, and the way the Daleks succumb to the virus.
Maurice Colbourne (Lytton) and his two bodyguards would reappear in Attack of the Cybermen where they would be killed off.  The character of Lytton, the ruthless and no-nonsense mercenary unafraid to tell the Daleks off, is one of the few interesting ones.  Same with Stien, a cowardly, uncertain, and later on, divided personality, and Rodney Bewes does a good portrayal to that effect.  All the other characters seem unimportant, as many are unnamed or unidentified until later episodes.
As this is Tegan's departure story, Janet Fielding has a good emotional leaving scene, where her character is sickened by the carnage that has taken place.  Indeed, only three humanoid characters survive in this extremely high body count story.
This story has been compared to Earthshock, which was also written by Eric Saward and featured the Cybermen, and has been criticized for being all gloss and no substance.  While the action sequences and regular characters are good, the lack of strong characters, and maybe too many characters who just fill up the story and get killed off.",1077408000,5,2828,4.844398340248962
553935,4,6303058876,"""Resurrection of the Daleks"" is the first of the stories available on DVD that I saw as a fan.  I was only eleven years old and had only been watching the show (aired nightly on PBS) for a month.  It made a huge impact on me and led, indirectly, to my sitting here on a perfectly pleasant September evening 19 years later, writing this review.
A lot of ""Resurrection"" is still effective today.  I saw this story first the year that it debuted -- 1984 -- and, of course, a lot of the acting and special effects seem woefully dated today.  What I like is the air of actual *menace* around these Daleks, as opposed to a string of predictable, less-than-memorable 1970s outings.  These Daleks actually instill horror in their victims.  They shoot on sight and play fast and loose with biological weapons.  ""Resurrection"" is a violent, gruesome story whose impact is only slightly dulled by the two dozen badly-acted death scenes of random extras.  One of the extras, referred to on the commentary track only as ""the Geek"", looks a lot like David Letterman.  For what it's worth.
The DVD extras make this package the better of the two ""DW"" stories released in the US this summer.  The obligatory text commentary, full of location filming dates and guest actor credits, also describes in detail the evolution of the story's script over the three years it took to get to screen.  We learn how actor Terry Molloy (the third and final ""Davros"") spent hours practicing the voice, to make the character sound like Michael Wisher, the original (and best) Davros.  Molloy truly is excellent playing a ranting wheelchair-bound villain in a latex mask (which, we learn, caused ""lakes of sweat"" to pool inside the oversized rubber chin), and would go on to play the role right up through the end of ""Doctor Who"" as a series.
The audio track is also a winner.  Peter Davison (the Doctor) is back for his third DVD and is, as always, hilarious.  Janet Fielding (Tegan, who makes her emotional departure at the end of ""Resurrection"") puts in her first DVD performance.  She's done her homework, giving a lot of convincing detail, and still finds time to count the many furtive glances that co-star Mark Strickson (Turlough) shot to the camera as he strived to get more face time.  Story director Matthew Robinson seems to remember the setup for every camera angle and every shot in the story, and lets us know it.  Still, it's the level of detail and humor that puts this in the ""above average"" range of DW audio commentaries, after a rather dull recent run by actors and directors with distressingly porous memories.
Another good extra is the lengthy ""on location"" segment, which returns to the narrow, dank Thames waterfront alleys where the story was filmed.  It's all gone upscale now.  Robinson re-enacts old scenes by lurking in alcoves that have since become pastry shop windows.  Also interspersed here is an interview with producer John Nathan-Turner, evidently the last interview he gave before his death last year.  Also in the ""deleted scenes"" is the alternative cliffhanger to Part Two... which was actually the cliffhanger used when I first saw this story in the US in 1984.  I like this ""alternate"" version better than the ""official"" one, as it ends a couple of menacing beats later.
The ultimate goal, I think, is to get as much of Davison's Season 21 output on DVD as possible.  We have two of his six stories out now, and that's just not enough.",1064188800,24,3444,4.731993299832496
553936,2,6303058876,"I love the Fifth Doctor, but this was not one of the better stories if his era.
In this DVD, some visual and audio fx are missing in part 4 where people are apparently shot by Daleks yet make pitiful sounding screams, no audio or visual for the blast.  It looks like a total farce when it should be a disturbing slaughtering.
The plot is also way too contrived, also pointlessly featuring an eventual invasion of Gallifrey (ugh) and throwing in a pointless clipshow of all the Doctor's previous companions, except for Leela of course.  (ugh)
Also, they shove a Dalek out of the second floor of the warehouse where it crashes outside.  For the rest of the warehouse scenes, the Dalek's bits are scattered throughout the INSIDE of the warehouse, nor suggesting anybody was stupid enough to move the wreckage inside...
And did the Supreme Dalek really have duplicates of all the world's major leaders in place to cause the destablization of Earth?!
Why does Stein do any number of things to help the Doctor when he apparently was a Dalek Duplicate ordered to capture the Doctor?!
Tegan's leaving scene almost makes up for this rubbish, but she claimed her travels stopped being fun.  If you looked at a handful of adventures  (threatened with rape, mind taken over by a malevolent entity - TWICE, threatened to be killed, interrogated by a lizard after watching ""The HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" thinking the Doctor - like Ford Prefect - came from Guildford, always complaining about the Doctor's inability to get her home, and so on, it didn't come across as being fun...)
This also has a 5.1 remix for the audio.  While the DVD menu is nothing less than brilliant, the re-mix for the story itself is an embarrassment.  Which is sad as the 5.1 remix for ""The Five Doctors"" special edition was superb by comparison.
If Warner Bros would release the following stories, I'd be a happier customer:
THE TWO DOCTORS (whose features alone will make it an instant purchase for me, but the story is very good too!)
THE SEEDS OF DEATH (an excellent story)
EARTHSHOCK (another excellent story)
THE THREE DOCTORS (may as well finish up the ___ Doctors stories but this one is entertaining)
and
THE CURSE OF FENRIC (which I originally hated but has grown on me since)
I know other fans will be happy over ""The Talons of Weng Chiang"" which is about to be released, but that one always bored me.  As for ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"", it's got nice outdoor location work but the plot and the final two episodes are so slapdashed and haphazerdly written that I can't ignore them, forget the part that the Daleks want to turn the Earth into a mobile spacecraft when they can already make their own.

553977,4,6303058876,"Death everywhere. That's all that can be said about Resurrection of the Daleks, and it's no wonder Tegan left. The emotional scene at the end is truly remarkable, and well acted by Peter Davison, Janet Fielding, and Mark Strickson. Janet's tears were real, and for some big Tegan fans such as myself, it's hard to say goodbye to such a good companion who has been on the show since the last Tom Baker show, Logopolis. Throughout the seasons we have seen her go through some changes, she was a very tempermental stewardess in the beginning but the next two seasons she certainly mellowed out. The commentary is excellent, and Janet is wonderful and seems happy to be back into the Who world. I recommend this story, although it is rather dark and boring at times...but the commentary with Janet is well worth it... for she hasn't done any Doctor Who in over ten years!",1059350400,5,867,4.636363636363637
553978,5,6303058876,"This was the 4th story of the 1984 Season 21 and the action continues on directly from ""Frontios"" where the 5th Doctor (Peter Davidson) and his companions Tegan (Janet Fielding) and Turlough (Mark Strickson) are desperately trying to free the TARDIS from a ""Time Corridor"".  Meanwhile, in London in the 1980's, a tramp is horrified to witness a strange group of men burst out of an abandoned warehouse and get machine-gunned down by a couple of police officers.  Somewhere in the future a prison space station holding the evil Davros, creator of the Daleks, comes under attack from a battle cruiser.
Materializing on Earth, the Doctor discovers that one end of the time corridor is located in the warehouse and the other end is on the space cruiser which belongs to the Daleks and is being used in an attempt to free Davros so that he can work on an antidote to a virus which is killing them off.  As the episode progresses the Doctor is horrified to find out that he has walked into a trap and that the Daleks intend to replicate him and his companions so that their doubles can travel to Galifrey and assassinate the High Council of the Timelords.  A frantic battle for survival takes place with the surviving space station crew fighting for their lives while the Daleks and their evil replicant soldiers attempt to complete their dastardly plan.  By the time the smoke clears only the Doctor and his companions are left alive with the exception of the leader of the Dalek's replicant troops who manages to slip quietly away with two of his men (later to return in Attack of the Cybermen).  Disgusted by the slaughter, Tegan decides to leave the TARDIS and runs from the warehouse in tears...
As Dalek stories go, this is one of the best and considering the budget it comes across as an extremely enjoyable and polished piece of classic science fiction.  The acting is excellent despite the use of certain actors in roles you would never expect to see them in (Rodney Bewes as Stien is particularly worthy of note as he was known as a comedy actor but managed to play the part of the Dalek double agent remarkably well).  Also worth mentioning is the wonderful commentary track with Peter Davidson (Doctor), Janet Fielding (Tegan) and Mat Robinson (Director) who enjoy themselves throughout and give us a real insight into the making of the story.

553981,5,6303058876,"I must congratulate the BBC's DVD department. They just cram these Doctor Who discs full of features.
This is a pretty good story anyway, continuing the story of the Davros character from a previous story, but it stands alone as well, so you will not be lost if you have not seen the other story. The Doctor's party arrives at Shad Thames in London (Some particularly good filming of a historic dockyard, shortly before 1980s redevelopment into trendy restaurants and flats) where the Daleks are operating a time corridor into the future with the assistance of a mercenary called Lytton, robot duplicates and fake policemen. The Daleks' plan is to rescue their creator Davros from imprisonment, and er... well probably take over the Earth or something. The plot's not that important sadly, but the dialogue and performances more than make up for this.
The regulars turn in good performances, particularly Peter Davison, whose Doctor goes through the mill in this adventure, showing great sadness at the end of the story as one of his companions departs. There are perhaps too many guest stars (the story is a little cluttered with characters) but the calibre of actor is very high, with Rodney Bewes and Maurice Colbourne particularly worthy of note. Terry Molloy is also pretty good as chief villain Davros, having a difficult job to take over the role from another actor at short notice.
The DVD has an informed and interesting commentary by Peter Davison, Janet Fielding, and director Matthew Robinson. They treat their work on the programme with both a great seriousness and also an irreverent humour, which is just right for the subject matter.
The isolated music score is a little curious. I can't really see anyone watching the DVD with just the music and no dialogue/effects noises. I tried this and it looked curiously like a silent movie. Perhaps this is more for fans of the music, which is a pretty good score by Malcolm Clarke.
The TARDIS-Cam No. 4 features a small underwater scene and is nothing spectacular.
The Breakfast Time interviews are interesting and good to have on this DVD as they help put the programme into the context of its time.
The on-location documentary is a little short and is hampered by the fact that producer John Nathan-Turner was interviewed separately from the director and writer.
The subtitled production notes are informative but there's so much information it's difficult to follow these at the same time as the commentary.
The extended and deleted scenes are nothing special, but it's nice to have them, and the same goes for the BBC1 trailer. There was supposed to be something called 'Whose Who' (it's listed on the back) but I couldn't find it! The Photo gallery is well-presented as usual, and much more watchable than most DVD galleries.
One point must be made, that the DVD transfer is very clear, the sound quality is superb, in particular the stereo re-mastering of the score and soundtrack. All in all, an excellent product.",1053302400,10,2980,4.9146825396825395

Tegan, inarguably one of the best female Dr. Who companions, is given quite the swan song, with Rula Lenska as a cynical space doctor, Terry Molloy proving himself to be the most excellent portrayal of Davros since ""Genesis"" (the guy in ""Destiny"" just didn't cut it), and Maurice Coulbourne making an a nice impression as the amoral, self-serving Lytton. It seemed as though the story could have used some paring down; some of the plotlines were superfluous and/or simply uninteresting. In the end, however, the Davros-engineered Dalek mutiny, the Movellan virus, the duplicates on earth, and some really nice battle sequences definitely make this a highlight of Peter Davison's last, and best, season. Followed by the excellent ""Planet of Fire"" and the unsurpassed ""Caves of Androzani,"" this is a must have for the Peter Davison/Dr. Who fan.

553984,2,6303058876,"Agh..this seems to be the worst Dalek story i've seen so far. Like in The Destiny of the Daleks, they are disappearing more an more into the background. I hate the way the pepperpots are portrayed so helpless without Davros, losing a battle against one of the most boring race of losers in the Dr Who universe, the Movellans. Even the human mercenaries with those silly dalek hats seem more efficient than the Daleks themselves. Sad, these are the creatures who once made the ""Dalek master plan"" and threatened the very universe!
  The thing that annoys me even more than the decline of the Daleks is the overall style of the story. After seeing most Peter Davison and Colin Baker Dr Who episodes i've HAD IT with the ""gritty, adult"" style. Instead of humor, sense of wonder and likeable characters these sad years gave us mostly violence and overall grimness, with the production values of a kiddies show,  cardboard sets and rubber monsters.
  In a poorly made gritty, adult show there are roughly two kinds of characters: 1)The ruthless killer who only cares about him/herself and 2)The coward who only cares about him/herself. The problem is, i wouldn't give a damn if they were all shot to pieces in part one.
  The only reason i give this one another star is the fact that it's allways interesting to see what the Daleks are up to now. Of course not all the 5th doctor stories were this bad, watch Kinda or Earthshock instead.",1024790400,2,1432,4.658730158730159
553985,2,6303058876,"Dr. Who has always been notorious for its cheezy special fx, but DW of old always had good story and memorable acting and was just plain fun to watch(the bottom line).
This did not have any of this.  I have never seen such silly melodramatic wound cries from being hit by a blaster. ""Oh agony agony.. the pain!""  They must not have paid these actors enough or they were trying to be 'creative' with thier death cries. Especially the duplicate guy who stuttered, ooing and aaahing from his blaster 'wound' for nearly all the way through episode 3(or 4).  A crewmember blasted one of her own people because he was disfigured from radiation. Not because he was a threat.(his death scene was actually fairly well done).
But most of all; the brainless shooting. It was like an episode of 'Rambo wannabe' instead of Dr. Who. It lacked the intellectual plots and charm that Dr. Who has always been known for.  This, much like the rest of the 1984 season was a 'season for shooting' I think, machine guns and nothing else. That is all I remember of Dr. Who season 21(1984) ending with Dr. #5's death(Not quite shot, but shot at).  No I am not saying violence should be excluded, I didn't like Colin Baker's series because it had none at all, and was boring and stupid.

553986,2,6303058876,"I hate ""Resurrection of the Daleks"". Well, what a way to start a review, but I have to be forthright when it comes to this story. Actually, what I hate most is that it could have been a terrific story, worthy of five stars, but the final product is an overindulgent, sloppily written, violent mess. 1984 was the beginning of a troubled period for the John Nathan-Turner Show....oops, sorry, Doctor Who, which it never really recovered from. The lunatics had taken over the asylum, or putting it another way, the fans had taken over the show's production. This meant that their whims and indulgences became part of the programme's canonical history. Nathan-Turner had an obsession with continuity, especially with (often gratuitous) references to classic stories, companions and enemies. This was certainly the case with ""Earthshock"", which brought back the Cybermen and a certain revisionist rewriting of Doctor Who. That was penned by Eric Saward, who also wrote this story. But ""Earthshock"" is much better, even with its gaping plotholes. ""Resurrection of the Daleks"" could be seen as the Dalek version of ""Earthshock"", with references to the show's history (the production team showing off their knowledge of Who), and of course, the obligatory flashbacks, this time of companions, for some reason excluding Leela. Here there are characters called Styles and Galloway (character names from previous Dalek stories), and references to the Movellans from the Tom Baker story ""Destiny of the Daleks"", all mixed into a somewhat confusing plot. At the same time the Daleks are attempting to rescue Davros because they are losing the war against the Movellans, capture the Doctor AND assassinate the High Council of Gallifrey (why? - this is never explained. The idea of the Daleks planning to invade Gallifrey, or at least a story in which the two races interact in some way is a very interesting one - a concept that could have been a story in itself - but not what was put forward here). There is indeed too much plot, which in stories like ""Death to the Daleks"" can be beneficial. But in this case, it creates more confusion. It is never clear what is exactly happening. There are other elements to this story that make it so unlikeable - the character of Davros is a glaring example. This is his third appearance; to put it frankly, he should not have made a second one. Michael Wisher's original portrayal of Davros in ""Genesis of the Daleks"" is one of the best performances of a villain ever - on television, stage or film. Wisher made Davros a true megalomaniac, with the importance of background and a slight sympathetic edge, but clearly allowing no justification for his actions. The decision to bring back Davros a second time in 1979 for ""Destiny"" was unwise - David Gooderson's portrayal did no justice to Wisher's, while bringing him back a third time is unforgivable. Terry Molloy's portryal is undoubtedly the worst; he is simply another thug; another baddie. Perhaps the worst aspect to the story, which would also have long term consequences for Doctor Who, is the violence. Doctor Who has always had people being killed, from the very beginning. But in most cases the deaths were sanitised - simple, laser gun deaths, with images that weren't disturbing. In ""Resurrection of the Daleks"" there are people being mowed down with machine guns; there are several close-ups of horribly burned faces after the gas is released into the prison. There are twisting, screaming and moaning (not to mention over the top) death scenes. John Nathan-Turner always intended to make Doctor Who a more serious, adult show - but is this the way to do it? Increase the violence, and so graphically? I believe not (but then, what would I know?) However, there are some positives to ""Resurrection of the Daleks"". The location footage of the warehouses by the Thames are haunting, extracting a sense of loneliness and desolation. The story is also boosted by mainly fine performances (although there are many bad ones - Rula Lenska as Styles is a character who could have been developed into an interesting person, but instead is reduced to walking around corridors, while Rodney Bewes as Stien alternates between good and awful). The best performance of the story is Maurice Coulbourne as the mercenary Lytton - he oozes mystery and menace. Lytton is also the best written character, with subtleties and something to hide. It is good to see him still standing at the end, walking off into the streets of London, initiating the prospect of encountering him again (which, of course, happens only a few stories away). Del Henney as Colonel Archer is another fine performance, especially the contrast between helpful ally and malicious, almost sadistic replicant. (Although his death is one of the terrible, over the top scenes mentioned above). Janet Fielding's last performance as Tegan is also very good; her departure is a tearjerker, but somewhat manipulative (another example of JNT trying to foster a sense of drama?) And, even though at the beginning I stated my stance on the story in no uncertain terms, it is well made. The direction is superb, and there is a glossy look to it. It is certainly one of the more generously budgeted stories of the season. The sets are good, and there are certainly plenty of big bangs. But it's an empty vessel. It is style over substance. It could have been better; it could have been decent, if not for the strings being pulled in the background.",989020800,12,5480,4.925405405405406

7836673,5,6303058876,"What is there to say about this one that hasn't already been said. It's suspenseful, violent and action packed. The Special Edition Disc looks fantastic. The documentary on the Fifth Doctor is excellent, as are the other features. Classic.",1476316800,,239,5.153846153846154
7836674,4,6303058876,"Another great Dalek tale. The story has a few issues which force me to knock a star off though. The story has some continuity errors and some plot errors which can make the story just a bit difficult to follow at times. Although it wasn't to be taken as humorous, one of the death scenes was so overacted that I just couldn't help but burst out laughing,

With that said, the story itself was pretty good and enjoyable. The premise of a time tunnel made for an interesting story.",1452470400,,479,4.382022471910112
7836675,3,6303058876,"Fifth Doctor Peter Davison is caught in a time corridor and forced to land on modern day Earth (that being 1984 London). Something weird is happening in a warehouse near the Thames. Police behave oddly and a bomb squad is babysitting a load of canisters. One soldier escapes and runs into the Doctor, who is curious to investigate, especially since one end of the time corridor is in the building. The other side of this particular corridor leads to a space station that is under attack. The station is a prison with just one prisoner in cryogenic storage--Davros, insane creator of the Daleks. The attacking ship is full of brainwashed humans who are working for...the Daleks! They want Davros for their own purposes.

The story is fairly entertaining with some good mysteries and interesting conversations about the situation between Davros and the Daleks. There's a lot of cat-and-mouse through the London warehouse and the space station--standard fare of old Doctor Who shows. The body count is pretty high in the episode, which surprised me a bit but doesn't make it a bad series. Davros himself is very shouty, making him less scary as a villain, though he makes up for that somewhat with his more calm and cunning conversations. Overall its an interesting episode but not a great one.",1443916800,,1291,4.894977168949771

7836677,4,6303058876,"This is probably the most action packed Doctor Who story to this with a body count that's staggering.

It's a landmark episode in many ways.  After more than 600 half hour episodes, this is the first serial featuring 45 minute episodes. It features Davros' appearance in the 1980s and re-establishes the Daleks as a true menace. For fans of the new series, the Daleks plan to assassinate the High Council can stand as a prelude to the Great Time War. It also features Tegan's departure from the TARDIS.

The setting was appropriately dark and atmospheric. There are some fascinating guest characters with solid performances and plenty of political intrigue afoot in the midst of the mad dash of action.
t
The Fifth Doctor is affected by the story leading to a dramatic decision in the second half of part two and  a memorable confrontation with Davros and the Doctor's statement about needing to change his ways foreshadows the coming regeneration two stories away.",1424736000,,965,4.901840490797546
