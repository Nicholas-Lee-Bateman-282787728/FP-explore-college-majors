8474984,3,B0015FNG78,"This edition has the look of a  direct to digital transfer from a pretty rough looking tape. Incidentally I have found this to be true of other releases from Raro Video. There is another version floating around, also Region 2 but a UK edition,which includes a couple of shots that were inexplicably cut from the Raro version (e.g a punchline to a joke. perplexing why they would cut some thing like that).

Still a great film, very realistic depiction of Black youth's struggles in Brixton just prior to the riot of 1981 that led to the repeal of 'sus law' i.e. racial profiling, similar to 'stop and frisk' in the US. I think the plot is structured to show a reasonable simulacrum of the shift in the oppressed youths' attitude  leading up to the Brixton riot. The climax of the film is a spark that set the blaze off, fictionalized of course, which makes it somewhat unique in its story telling.",1404864000,,897,4.559006211180124
