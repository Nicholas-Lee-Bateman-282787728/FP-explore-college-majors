509369,4,6302767741,"It's far beyond the sobby standards of ""Why Did I Get Married?"", ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"", and ""Silver Linings Playbook"". Think of PETER'S  FRIENDS  as a grown-up version of ""St. Elmo's Fire"", only with a more direct 'And so it begins' feel to it.

Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton are a struggling married couple coping with the loss of one child and still having one left. Emma Thompson is a shy single woman in need of self-appreciation, and with a sort of premature yearning for the title character. Stephen Fry is affluent Peter who has a devastating secret to reveal in regard to his health. Kenneth Branagh is in a fading, humiliating marriage to C-level actress Rita Rudner who thinks she runs the world despite that she doesn't. Alphonsia Emmanuel is sex addict yet to cease and desist, all while in an affair with a married Tony Slattery.

To me, Rudner's character is one the film could have done without. As self-indulgent and image-crazed as she is. But hey, it still shows how shallow overachievers, in and out of the arts, can be.  Hugh Laurie (in the role of Roger) is right to ask, ""What about the men?"" in regards to coping with tragic losses and similar situations. It's so easy to focus on women in such jams, but not the men. Furthermore, the story could have went on about a week in place of two days and two nights. But the visitation time is limited, with jobs and family to worry about.

In sum, while it's not a full-frontal award winner, PETER'S FRIENDS is ideal for get-together stories, namely with implications (of the friends' lives at home) not being too big or too small. The narrative does not stall. The stated problems and struggles are not all that bring Peter and his friends together; the same can said in real life. And it's all about getting really good actors, not models, in on the project.

Imagine. Some of the cast went to college/university together for real! The greater the realism of the interaction.",1405468800,,1953,4.627167630057803

509374,4,6302767741,"`Peter's Friends' is a pretty fun and entertaining film that has the right amount of wit and charm to make the film feel relevant and fresh, even if some of the themes are a tad out of date in today's world.  Still, there is an air of impact because of the setting and the dedication of the cast to the material.  The cast is exceptional, with stellar performances from everyone involved.

Stephen Fry anchors the film with his soft and sincere depiction of a grown man trying for the first time to act grown.  Kenneth Branagh (who also directed the film) has a very relaxed and charismatic presence, and it bodes well for his development of character.  Thompson, Staunton and Laurie cycle the more serious roles with ease, and Emmanuel and Slattery are standouts as the new `couple' in the group.  With Rudner providing comedic relief, and Phyllida Law hanging behind as a paternal observer, this cast is to die for!

The film opens with a hilarious and perfectly laid out sequence of six friends performing a cabaret together for the last time.  After that, shoot forward in time to friends living separate lives and far removed from each other for years (ten to be exact).  After Peter's father dies he invites all of his friends to his father's mansion for one last New Year's Eve party.  Each friend brings with them some baggage and over the course of the vacation they open those suitcases and share that baggage with everyone in the home.  Tears are shed, laughs are had and smiles cross faces; not to mention some yelling and fighting and love making.

The dialog keeps coming and keeps the film moving, and the storyline, while a tad `step by step' in parts, is nicely woven.  It isn't a film that I'll come back to over and over, and it isn't a film that I'll look back on as a `great film' (it tries to make a serious point, or points, but it doesn't have the heft needed to really do that) but it is a very good film with a solid foundation that I can't help but enjoy.",1365033600,,1982,4.472222222222222

As others have noted, this is really just a Transatlantic imitation of The Big Chill. I don't like that film much, either, and so I'm of course not going to be crazy about watching an imitator. There are some clever lines, I will admit, but each character has become mired in his or her personal rut since the group last reunited, and each rut is stated and restated and analyzed in about every facile and melodramatic manner one could imagine. Still, there's a lot of talent on that screen, and while I cringe at the script I can admire the actors' attempts to salvage it. At some point, however, there will come a point where I won't be able to watch even a few minutes of this disappointing film anymore, and I suspect that point will arrive early next year.",1350604800,,938,4.459302325581396

509408,5,6302767741,"Yes, the premise is the same as the Big Chill, but the story, characters, and feel of the movies are completely different.  They are not at all similar, and should not be compared and judged against one another.  Peter and friends do not sit around thinking about how idealistic they once were, and now look at us--which was the theme of the Big Chill.  I like and enjoy both movies.

So, Peter's Friends is about a group of old college friends who used to perform in a musical revue.  They and some of their significant others gather at the stately home of Peter for a New Year's weekend.  The host is Peter, a man who may be gay, or maybe he's bisexual, or is he asexual, or is he just not sure?  Roger and Mary were both part of the college musical act.  They have married and are successful jingle writers, but the death of one of their infant twins has put a strain on them and their marriage.  Mary has turned into an over protective mother, obsessed with worry about the remaining twin.  Maggie is a ""plain Jane"" who wants to avoid impending spinster-hood, so she sets her cap for Peter, who as I already stated, isn't sure if he's interested in sex with anybody.  Sarah has had a long string of boyfriends because she only dates men who are married or involved with another woman.  She brings along her latest married lover, an obnoxious jerk that the others all loathe at first sight.  Andrew is a writer who has gone Hollywood, and isn't very satisfied by his successful career or his marriage to a fitness obsessed American actress.

There are some dramatic scemes, as well as some very funny scenes.  I particularly like Rita Rudner's performance as the over the top glam actress who piles on layers of fake hair.  One of the best lines is when she asks the uncooperative housekeeper ""Have you never seen Upstairs, Downstairs?""

This is a movie you can watch over and over.  I'd like to have most of these people as friends--except for Sarah and Brian.  <smile>",1253750400,3,1973,4.507042253521127

509410,5,6302767741,"""Peter's Friends"" is the British ""Big Chill."" And while it may be a stretch to see yourself among this ensemble of Brits gathering to celebrate New Year's Eve in a castle, you can relate to their dilemma; in a way, growing up sucks.

509414,4,6302767741,"This 1992 Film by stage and screen actor/director Kenneth Branagh is a real treat. Many reviews at the time simply labelled it as the English 'Big Chill'... though it shows some similarities in terms of plot techniques the films couldn't be more different in terms of style, performace and tone.

The basic plot is as follows:

Seven friends in an acting troupe graduate from Cambridge University in 1982 and go their separate ways. Ten years later, Peter inherits a large estate from his father, and invites the rest of the gang to spend New Year's holiday with him. Many changes have taken place in the lives of all the friends assembled, but Peter has a secret that will shock them all.

There are a couple of scenes that jump out at me; when Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton are arguing on the bed; and when they all gather around the piano to sing.

Many of my favourite actors are in this film and they don't disappoint. While a couple of performances are over-the-top, most are very good.

The screenplay has some great moments and the choice of music is perfect. It brings me back to the time when I graduated from College; those songs were the soundtrack of my life.",1214524800,4,723,4.3088235294117645

Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton deliver wonderful and touching performances and that in itself is worth the price of the DVD. But, the Kenneth Branagh - Rita Rudner characters are the backbone of the piece and that relationship never becomes understandable. Plus, the tone moves from slapstick to serious without any real connective pieces. Okay, I will probably watch it again and maybe even again--I mean just watching the Cambridge Footlights crew together is a pleasure (and Stephen Fry always makes me smile). This film is often compared to ""The Big Chill"" but it doesn't deliver the same impact.",1207267200,,814,4.9489051094890515
509428,2,6302767741,"Without including any spoilers to the film:

Just as the title to this review states, it was just simply painful to watch.  The movie is about a group of friends who have lost touch over the years and are invited out to the English countryside by one mate from the group for a New Years celebration reunion.  As things in life go, they find themselves having grown apart over the years, each 'friend' pursuing their seperate life and each friend having their own set of burdoning problems to deal with.

It's painful to watch because this movie is about a reunion, and we are met with awkward scene after awkward scene of each character battling their own demons that have plagued their after-we-all-lost-touch life.  And it's even more difficult to watch when things would get heated and characters would yell things ""they didn't mean to say"" about other characters while in their presence.

What's even more painful about watching the movie is listening to it.  The movie has one of the most annoying and predictable soundtracks making me wonder if the script was actually written around the songs themselves.  Every fresh scene we are met with a cliche ""reminiscent"" song that sums up the previous scene and can pretty much sum up any sort of 80's teen movie.

However, despite my unusually harsh review, the acting in the movie is absolutely brilliant.  Those who are a fan of Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, and the rest of that class's Cambridge Footlights cast will be pleased to see old favourites reuniting in this movie.  Being strictly familiar with Hugh Laurie's comic career, I was immensely impressed with his big scene (each character in the movie has their own poignant scene where they deal openly with whatever their particular conflict is), that showscases his ability in dramatic roles.  You sympathise with Emma Thompson's character and the way she is gets treated by her ""friends"" in a couple scenes.  Tony Slattery, while his character is completely annoying at first, he ends up giving a great performance.  And of course, Stephen Fry is simply great (and you really feel for him during those awkward scenes I mentioned earlier), but the conflict that his character is battling within this film is simply predictable; not to mention, once he does reveal his secret to the group, his speech on the topic becomes predictable, as if it was lifted from one of those after-school specials.

While I know this review will be met with rolling eyes, it is simply what I thought about the movie itself, not the actors (some of them which I'm a huge fan of).

It's just one of those movies I would have been better off Netflixing, as it doesn't even have any bonus material making it a worthwhile buy.",1206662400,4,2709,4.781115879828326

An extraordinary mix of drama and razor-sharp comedy... not to mention a terrific soundtrack... it is a real crowd-pleaser.  I've watched it many times with many friends and every one of them has enjoyed it as much as I. The acting is top-notch across the board, with two of my favorite actresses, Emma Thompson and Imelda Staunton, in the ensemble.

Comparisons to ""The Big Chill"" were commonplace when ""Peter's Friends"" came out, but the latter is really superior in every way (not to take away from the former).  This is a truly terrific movie, well-directed and with a wonderful screenplay co-written by Rita Rudner.

I am really excited that the US DVD is now going to be available.  If you haven't yet seen this, I can't recommend it highly enough.  If by chance you buy this and are disappointed, I invite you to send me a very strongly worded eMail.

This is for me, a quintessential friend film.  Though often compared with ""The Big Chill"", I prefer this british model every time.  With a sterling cast with stand out performances by Kenneth Branaugh and Emma Thompson, it is filled with amazing humor (""fill me with your babies!"") and tears of joy.  Not to be ignored is Rita Rudner who plays a wonderful character as Branagh's AA partner/actress wife.  Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie and a very pre-Umbridge Imelda Staunton are also fantastic in the film.  The most touching of scenes in the film occurs with the Fry/Staunton couple finally dealing with the death of their son.  (The camera shot of them sleeping cuddled has stuck with me for years.)

Have been searching for it on DVD for so many years, I'd really given up hope it would ever be available. The acting is superb! The chemistry between the cast is dynamic. The music is a potpourri of 1980's classics. And a great story. When I managed for Hollywood Video, this was a film I recommended everyone see, and I will say, without exaggerration, that everyone who watched it liked it. And a LOT of people watched it. Those who were skeptical, walked out with a free rental. And loved it! Needless to say, my store probably lost money on Peter's Friends, but it was all worth it. To spread this film to the public was my mission, and I served it well. Kenneth Branagh created a true masterwork, and for fans of ""House"", Hugh Laurie is great. Stephen Fry, Emma Thompson, all are great. I am not exaggerating when I say, you'll love it!",1198800000,22,952,4.353932584269663
509445,5,6302767741,"Any film that begins with six of the greatest British actors of their generation in a kickline wearing garters and rainbow cancan skirts cannot possibly go wrong.  Or rather, it could, but it doesn't.  Peter's Friends is a gem of a small movie, with touching characters and some truly hilarious lines.  Rita Rudner's script (and acting) is beautiful.  Fans of any of these actors must watch it, and others will become fans.  Get this to DVD!!!",1192665600,2,443,4.776315789473684

Both the script and the actors are superb. One might even call it the British Big Chill. Please, please, PLEASE release this on region 1 DVD, so those of us who don't live in Japan and Africa can watch this delightfully entertaining film.",1167782400,5,398,4.465753424657534

509450,5,6302767741,"Kenneth Branagh's follow-up to his enormous smash hits ""Henry V"" and ""Dead Again"" is a British sex comedy again featuring his then-wife Emma Thompson and Stephen Fry in the title role, with himself and Ms. Thompson as two of his friends. Hugh Laurie (""Prince Ninnybrain"" in Season II of ""Blackadder,"" Mr. Palmer in ""Sense & Sensibility"" (also starring and scripted by Emma Thompson), TV's ""House,"" etc), Imelda Staunton (Margaret in ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" etc) and Alphonsia Emmanuel round out the ""Friends"" in the cast of this wonderfully entertaining sex comedy from Kenneth Branagh. Refreshing change of pace after Shakespeare (""Henry V"") and film noir (the Hitchcock-laden tribute suspense thriller ""Dead Again""), precluding his all-star films ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"" William Shakespeare's Hamlet"" and ""Love's Labour's Lost."" DO NOT watch this movie if you do not like (or are not used to) British comedy. You WILL be in for a VERY RUDE awakening; colorful, to say the least.

509452,5,6302767741,"I had read several negative reviews and so was prepared for the worst, but the fabulous performance of Hugh Laurie in TV's ""House"" convinced me to give this film a try.  The movie was wonderful: heartfelt, funny, sad, hopeful and exasperating.  All the things real friends are.  As expected, Laurie was grand as were Fry and Branaugh, but also deserving of mention is the wonderfully droll performance of Phyllida Law, Emma Thompson's real-life mother, as the wise cook.",1113868800,9,470,5.0

509480,5,6302767741,"A truly touching film about 6 friends (not exactly Friends), this independant from 1992 film won my heart. With a brilliant opening scene, and the credits traveling from the last time they were all together in 1982 (with political break throughs and famous people littering the screne set to the great Tears for Fears tune ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"") and a brilliant story line, Peter's Friends is once of the best independant films out there. Directed and acted by the great British Kenneth Branaugh with Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry as Peter, and Imelda Staunton, it's no wonder this is such a terrific flick.
Set on New Year's Eve, 1992, each person comes to Peter's estate for one last new years in his house, since Peter's father died. It has been 10 years since they had all been together, performing a small cabaret show to anyone who would actually want them there to perform. Now, all the friends have been married, movied away, or in destructive (or no) relationships. During the course of the weekend, they all rediscover one another as well as discover who they are. With an pwerful script, setting, and cast of characters, Peter's Friends is one of the best. I completely recommend you see it and enjoy yourselves. It's brilliant, so have fun!!!",980640000,49,1278,4.8136363636363635
509481,4,6302767741,I like that everyone has some positive comment about this movie and I love that many of the supportive comments come from americans .Its somehow gratifying that on such a diet of mindless sitcoms and soulless blockbusters some of our american cousins can still discern between quality vs quantity. Naive of me I know but there you are. Peters Friends is by no means the most talented ensemble of actors ever cast but it is up there in the top ten. The synopsis of the story has been retold many times so I need not belabor the point except to add that this was an exceptionally good film that deserved better than what the critics gave it...hire it out today.,977356800,9,659,4.5
509482,5,6302767741,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said? This is a very well made movie with some of the best performances I have ever seen. Everyone gives 110% in their respective roles. I was familiar with Branagh, Thompson, Fry, Laurie, and Rudner before seeing this, and even the ones I wasn't familliar with still played convincingly. There was just so much chemestry between all of the actors. I showed this to a friend yesterday, and he loved it. The humor (especially Branagh's) was right on target, and it made us laugh even after the film was over. My friend (who is an aspiring writer) told me that some of the scenes in the film sounded like something he would've thought up. I liked the opening credits of Peter's Friends as well. They go through all the pop culture starting in 1982 (where the movie begins) and ending up in 1992 (where the movie picks up after the credits). A soundtrack of familiar '80s songs in also helpful. Many people will compare this to The Big Chill, but this one stands alone and in most cases, better than The Big Chill. Peter's Friends is an example of how to make a funny entertaining film that people can relate to a personal level. The lesson it gives is no matter how messed up your friends get, they will always be there for you. Way to go, Branagh.",969926400,10,1295,4.445378151260504
509483,4,6302767741,"How often do you see a movie in which women are acknowledging how their egos, denied feelings, self-destructive behaviors and deep lonliness are  making them obliterate their relationships before the men in their lives  ever have a chance to? And how often do you see that without the kind of  heavy handed comedy that is usually designed as a secret apology for doing  anything but infantilizing women via romance and triumph over  victimization?
That alone makes the movie worth seeing.  The men and  women in this film are going through a lot of stuff, not the least of which  wishing they could go back to the time when life seemed to make sense- when  they were all together and much closer as friends.  But they can only move  forward: they can only accept the degree to which they are products of  their environment, and how that degree is much smaller than what they would  like to believe- in fact, to what degree they constructed their  environments through their choices in life.  One couple, married, still  grieving the death of a child, must face the anger at each other and  themselves- and God- before it destroys their marriage like a cancer; and  the husband leads the way.  One woman must face how she manipulates men  into severing their relationships with other women for her, only to blow  them off dazed and brokenhearted when there is nothing left to stand in the  way of her committing herself to them, including their old lives. Another  must come to terms with his sexuality enough to share it with his friends,  one of which has fallen in love with him, for all the wrong reasons.  The  comedy in this film is there by necessity I think moreso than artifice or  decoration; if you don't laugh at times at how confusing and hard life can  be you can't live it.  It balances out the transformation each character  must go through in order to get on with their lives, and be true to the  friendships they have reestablished that they owe so much joy and  revalation to.
The acting in this movie is wonderful, and through it  all, there are some pretty funny scenes.  The movie as a whole though can  have the effect of having your soul scrubbed with a scouring pad if you see  yourself or any life experience reflected in the characters.  And if you  think you can relate to anyone of them, or think you know someone who is  like one of them, you probably will.
A very special movie.  Don't rent  it for a group of friends, unless you're prepared to go through a similiar  roller coaster- and then be closer to them all then you ever have been  before.",966384000,33,2577,4.534934497816594
509484,5,6302767741,"I can't imagine how this film could ever get bad reviews... May be some people/critics were offended by the character of a neurotic Hollywood actress...well, this portrayal is all-true, whether we like it or not.  ""Peter's Friends""  is a heartwarming story of six or seven  college friends, brought together by one of them, after ten years of little  or no contact. The casting is absolutely perfect. These guys really feel  like friends (well, Stephen Fry & Huge Laurie are; Kenneth Branaugh  & Emma Thompson, I think, used to be married?). Although this film is  very sentimental and talks about many of life's saddest things (e.g.  loosing a child, loosing a parent, divorse, etc.), it manages to be  exremely funny and witty (British trademark, after all) Sometimes, I was  not sure if I was crying or laughing; may be, I was doing both at the same  time... You will not believe how funny Emma Thopson and how hearbreaking  Kenneth Branaugh and Huge Laurie are in this film!  In my opinion, if  you watch this film, you can become a bit of a better person.

I was also thrilled to see a film with Tony Slattery in it, playing an atypical role. He did very well; I was impressed  and pleased. It's not a light-hearted movie, but it is heartwarming  overall. And yes, Americans might have trouble with some of the British  humor; I always seem to.

'Peter's Friends' is delightfully, thoroughly and completely British, though ironically, the script is by American Rita Rudner.  She did a fine job and has a small role in it as well.  And Kenneth Branagh's smooth directing makes this film fun to watch.  It's about a group of college buddies getting together ten years on to reminisce about the good 'ol days.  It's New Year's Eve, it's mostly happy and no one has died.  Emma Thompson's performance is a hoot - she seemed to have the most fun.
