2928070,2,B000V02CNW,This DVD bored me. Sorry. The premise was interesting but I found as the DVD played on my attention was elsewhere. It should have been interesting as I have never heard of this story surrounding the Princes in the Tower. Read the synopsis and forget the DVD.,1199750400,21,258,4.51063829787234
2928071,1,B000V02CNW,"The 'troubled' hairpieces sitting on top of the young actors' heads on the cover should have told me something...

Besides having endless droning narration and, more offensively, employing 'moving cow' camera work (where the camera never stays still, in an attempt to demonstrate a kind of realism), this film has no script. Able actors, yes - but nothing else.

Look. If a producer won't spend the money, or even worse not notice that money wasn't spent to make his lead actor's hairpiece look realistic, and not like a wig bought at a Walmart's After Halloween sale, it's unlikely they will pay any more attention to their overall production, which in this case is abysmal.

Tantalizing history. Find it elsewhere.",1199232000,35,716,5.0

8215974,4,B000V02CNW,"This film focuses on the pretender Percy Warbeck (Mark Umbers) who during the reign of Henry VII (played by Paul Hilton) claimed to bne the younger of the two princes in the Tower of London imprisoned and murdered during the reign of Richard III: Prince Richard, now the rightful Richard IV.
Most of the film focuses on Warbeck.'s interrogation. And on his relationship with Queen Elizabeth of York, who if his claim is true would be the sister who sung him to sleep. The first half drags in parts. But is enlivened by the intelligent conversation of Dr. John Argentine (John Castle) and Bishop De Cambrai (Roger Hammond) .
The second part picks up pace and races to a spine chilling conclusion.
The main arch-villain of the piece is not Richard Third, the Duke of Buckingham or Henry Tudor, but Henry's mother Maragret Beufort presented as more evil than Lady Macbeth.
And whose role in the mystery would if I reveled it her be a major spoiler
But expect a major shock near the end.",1389398400,2,983,4.622857142857143
8215975,3,B000V02CNW,A great film which I have seen elsewhere and which presents an interesting slant on the age old mystery of the two princes - it even has a good looking Richard III! However 'Be warned!' I ordered three films from this supplier and what they don't tell you is you can't play them because they are for the US market despite this one being a UK made film. Plus the import customs duty is more than the cost of the films and postage. Fingers burnt - lesson learnt!,1346371200,,460,4.238636363636363
8215976,4,B000V02CNW,"This is an excellent movie for anyone interested in the Wars of the Roses, Richard III and particular in the pretenders that aggravated the reign of Henry VII. This movie is about the most interesting of them, Perkin Warbeck (who may very well have been the younger prince). The movie focuses on how the princes in the tower may have met their end, if indeed they died there, and who may have been responsible. The end is a little convoluted, and not true to actual history. But all in all a good movie on the subject, telling a plausible story.",1287100800,3,545,4.46
8215977,5,B000V02CNW,As someone who loves history I really enjoyed this movie though it ended in tragedy. I had no idea or even knew this transpired.  This would be a great teaching tool for a history teacher.,1276560000,,188,4.371428571428571
8215978,3,B000V02CNW,This movie offers an interesting take on what might have happened to the Princess.  It is part historical fact and part fantacy since we will never know for sure what really happened.  I enjoyed the movie but would not purchase it again.,1216684800,3,237,4.619047619047619
8215979,5,B000V02CNW,"This period movie revealed information to me of which I was unaware despite having been taught the history of England at school.

I thought it was well done and well acted and will keep it in my collection to watch again.",1208995200,5,221,4.390243902439025
8215980,3,B000V02CNW,A realistic story explaining the fate of the princes. Very enjoyable but picture quality is degarded throughout due to below normal definition.,1208822400,3,143,5.545454545454546
8215981,5,B000V02CNW,"The background surrounding the mystery of the Princes in the Tower is extremely complicated, and I find it amazing that the producers were able to do as fine job of the history as they did. While taking some dramatic license, the story is based on a well-documented historical meeting between the Bishop of Cambray and the Spanish Ambassador who visited the prisoner -- the so-called ""Pretender"" -- in the Tower after his capture by the first of the Tudors, Henry VII.  As mentioned by another viewer, this is more a docu-drama, and those who are looking for a movie should look elsewhere. Nevertheless, if you like a good mystery, you'll find this absolutely riveting. If this production has a fault, it's that Henry VII, whose cold and calculating nature was well known even at the time, is portrayed too sympathetically. What is captured well is the darkness and horror of this period of the Wars of the Roses; the ruthless and predatory nature of the dominant personalities involved; and the terrifying predicament of the ""Pretender.""  Much of what is portrayed is actually historical fact, including the torture that ""Perkin Warbeck"" was subjected to. The general thesis of this drama is powerful-- and daring, viz. History is written by the victors, and the Pretender may well have been who he said he was -- Richard, King of England, executed by the usurper, Henry VII.",1207267200,9,1376,4.901287553648069
8215982,4,B000V02CNW,"This DVD is pretty close to a dramatized documentary. If you are looking for a movie, this isn't for you. However, if you like historical documentaries, this is a fascintating retelling of the mystery of the Princes in the Tower and what became of the younger prince, Richard, who later emerged as the pretender to the throne.

Most of the story unfolds as a re-enactment of a supposed interrogation of Richard IV by the Tudors, specifically Margaret Beaufort and company.

This DVD would be more interesting to people very well versed in the War of the Roses and Henry VII's reign. If you aren't familiar with Henry VII's reign and the Perkins Warbeck affair, you might not enjoy it that much.",1204848000,25,694,4.7272727272727275
