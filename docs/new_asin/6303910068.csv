7854357,5,6303910068,Very good movie.  I am glad that I found out about it.  It is fun to see Neil Patrick Harris in one of his earliest roles after Doogie Howser,1412208000,,141,3.8275862068965516
7854358,4,6303910068,I didn't know he starred in this movie. He's such a good actor. This is a good romantic movie with a twist. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to family and friends.,1360540800,,173,4.117647058823529
7854359,3,6303910068,"We have here a privately-manufactured DVD. My experience with barebones DVD-Rs has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

Hugo Fregonese's serious take on the Jack the Ripper story, MAN IN THE ATTIC (1953) has a curiously campy ooh-la-la number 20 minutes in. While a bevy of cuties gaily warbled ""You're in Love"" and sashayed their stuff on screen, cash registers at theater refreshment counters all over America probably rang with equal gaiety. And there's two more such interruptions later on. Argentine-born Fregonese, husband of Faith Domergue, broke new ground here with his amalgam of the serial killer and musical genres; unfortunately, ""Attic"" doesn't have the panache, melodic appeal or element integration of Tim Burton's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SWEENEY-TODD/dp/B0013D8LOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SWEENEY TODD</a>&nbsp;(USA/UK-2007).

The story opens with promise: a nicely executed foggy night scene where a reeling floozy is snuffed almost in sight of two ""crushers"" who patrol eerily vacant Whitechapel streets. Next, Mr. Slade (Jack Palance), a self-proclaimed pathologist, rents two rooms and a chazerai-cluttered attic from Helen Harley (Frances Bavier) and her husband William (Rhys Williams). Shades of previous ""Lodger"" films when Slade objects to wall art; the eyes of ladies depicted ""follow"" him, you see.

The Harleys' niece, Lily Bonner (Constance Smith) is introduced immediately after, as is a time-padding popcorn-pushing stage number.

Palance nicely underplays his role of the suspected Ripper, adding just a smidgen of neurosis. Even so, Hitchcock's silent version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-LODGER/dp/B001JV5BIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE LODGER</a>&nbsp;(UK-1927) is superior to this one. My preference however is for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-PHANTOM-FIEND/dp/B002FOFXLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE PHANTOM FIEND</a>&nbsp;(UK-1932). In this dark early talkie, Ivor Novello reprises his earlier ""Lodger"" character, bringing to the reworking a Slavic accent and some considerable pianistic skills.

Seems it's hard to keep music from sneaking like Jack himself into several variations of the Whitechapel Killer story. I'll have a Diet Moxie (no ice) with that popcorn, please.",1358121600,,2565,6.622023809523809
7854360,4,6303910068,"I was really surprised to see how fast the DVD arrived. Although the price was spicy, the movie is very good and the quality of the DVD is impeccable. Moreover, I need to say that I am very glad as an Amazon client.",1347321600,,215,4.023255813953488
7854361,3,6303910068,"An older woman hiding her younge lover in the attic of her house for years without her husband suspecting any unusual activity seems unreal, expect that this movie is based on a true story. Anne Archer is leading the action, Neil Patrick Harris is doing what he can but has some good moment considering that he was 22 when he played that complicated caracter.
The uncommun situation of the story keeps you going, wanting to know how it's going to end...
but the end was really flat..Was nominated for 3 Gemini awards.",1314403200,3,517,4.630434782608695
7854362,4,6303910068,"I saw this film the first time shortly after it was released and I was surprised at how good it really was.  It shows how far a cheating heart will go to get what they want. Also, how the person you fall in love with isn't always the best person for you. This woman is truly toxic and shameless. A very disturbing tale. I wish it was on DVD...but, I will re-purchase (mine is broken)on VHS. I love this movie!",1213056000,4,409,4.1125
