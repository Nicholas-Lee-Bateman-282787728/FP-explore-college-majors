This for me not only bring back lovely memories but is great to see such brilliant performers at their very best. Golden Moments is a DVD you can replay and relive the artistry of a very special duo.",1374969600,,285,4.107142857142857
2651083,2,B000I2J056,"If only some of the earlier VHS videos were remastered and released on disk!! From the video it is possible to see how incredibly great they were. In the intro to Fred & Ginger they mention how inspired they were by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' dancing. They, or perhaps better said the camera people and the editors, forgot why Fred Astaire insisted on full body shots and no editing. You could see how beautiful their dancing was. In this video almost all of Torvill and Dean's ice dancing was cut up by editing and partial body shots. It was nearly impossible to enjoy their grace and beauty. Who ever was responsible for this should be ashamed of themselves. Some of the original Olympic and amateur footage can be seen on YouTube. You can see a better version, even if the resolution isn't as good.
I also have a DVD player that can show PAL formatted movies. They're not expensive and open up a selection of movies not released on disk over here. I recommend that to the other disappointed reviewer.",1354924800,14,1008,4.574585635359116
