6230293,5,B00HW3EK8G,"I genuinely enjoyed this movie, despite the fact that this coming out story, is more about the affect that his best friend's coming out has on the straight friends and family than the gay teenager. The atmosphere and characters could just as easily be found in one of those frat-boy, ""Animal House,"" movies (more mischievous than raunchy). The cast includes many well-known character actors that include Megan Mullally and Gary Cole in parental roles, plus Larry Wilmore as the school principal, and many surprises. The story begins with the two buddies striking a strong bond as children, while creating a mischievous ruckus in a school play. Growing up together, the main story is about their friendship as it evolves into their senior year of high school, when one of the guys comes out to his girlfriend and to his best friend, exclusively, expecting them to keep his secret. The secret weighs heavily on the straight friend, who doesn't know quite how to handle it., especially when he finds his pal making out with his new boyfriend at their old outdoor hang-out. Add to this confusion is the fact that he is in love with  the ex-girlfriend of the now out buddy. It's a good story and all is in a good place: the acting, the directing and music are first class.

6230300,3,B00HW3EK8G,"It's difficult to put into words how I feel about this movie. It's pretty well written and acted, but

THE CASTING WAS REALLY OFF.

(So was the makeup and costume design.)

Date and Switch is about high school students, so you would EXPECT the cast to look like they might be seniors in high school or, at least, college freshmen. Every high school character looked like they were being played by a thirty year old. I don't know how they managed to make Dakota Johnson & Sarah Hyland look almost a decade older, but they did. It was disturbing.

It sort of reminded me of a Seth Rogen & James Franco movie, except that their movies are typically a little funnier and a bit more crass. But it didn't make sense which is JUST like one (make that all) of their movies. It also had a pretty nice message at the end of it about friendship and acceptance, which is kinda like their movies, too.

But it was an okay movie. Not mind-blowingly awesome, but it didn't totally such. I don't think I'd recommend buying it, but watching it when it's on television wouldn't be a bad idea.",1453507200,,1074,4.404040404040404

6230327,4,B00HW3EK8G,"I departed high school decades ago, but the people in my life then are still the people I remember, respect and stay in touch with to this day! High school was and is for many folks a milestone and the discoveries we make about ourselves and others at the end of this 1st Act, often sets the stage for the drama in the 2nd Act. One problem, few if any folks, are mature and aware enough to recognize this fact, and it is only in retrospect for many, that they realize what really transpired in high school. Not so with the characters in this film. In fact, these high schoolers seem preternaturally mature--which is both refreshing and perhaps a bit unrealistic. And to be fair, these high schoolers have some pretty enlightened adults in their lives--also a bit unrealistic, but it happens.  Nonetheless, this is a good--very good script and the film has some rather important and accomplished actors in supporting roles, which says a lot about their belief in the script and overall theme of the movie. I love that film makers and writers are telling the story of the diversity within subcultures and by doing so giving all individuals a chance at being who they believe they are, even if that sense of self does not comport with the hackneyed archetypes certain media cramm down our throats incessantly. The protagonist, in his coming-out to his best friend describes himself as a ""gay dude."" How self-aware is that. He knows he is gay, but he also knows he is still just a regular guy. I wonder if folks get that...I wonder if high school folks can get that. This film is a very good effort towards that goal.",1431388800,,1613,4.581314878892734

6230376,5,B00HW3EK8G,"A movie about a teen guy coming out with homophobic parents shouldn't be funny, but this is funny. I haven't laughed so much in years. Some how this indie movie manages to comment sensitively and sensibly on a really hard time in any gay teen's life and at the same time make you fall off the couch laughing. What makes it work is that except for the main four characters played by Nicholas Braun, Hunter Cope, Dakota Johnson and Zach Craggier, who by the way do a great job with the material, every person in this film is such a complete outrageous stereotype that they just can't be taken seriously for a second. It's like four real people walking around in a comic strip. It even has a nice happy ending.
Buy this movie, invite all your friends over, and have the most fun ever!",1425254400,,781,4.393103448275862

6230378,4,B00HW3EK8G,"Matty (hunter Cope) and Michael (Nicholas Braun) are best friends and have grown up together. They are now approaching their prom night but are both still virgins. Well we all know the smell of desperation oozes out of virgins like a reversed effect pheromone and so they decide they have to get some serious bedroom action.

So they make a hash cake in preparation for a big celebration and go about the art of seduction - badly. Then Matty announces he is actually gay - as if this minor bombshell wasn't enough Michael starts to fall for Matty's ex girlfriend. The path to non virgindom then begins and despite Michael's attempts at helping his best bud get his rocks off, he starts to feel the strain and there inevitably will be some ups and downs (sorry awful joke that).

This is just great fun. Megan Mullally has a small but perfectly formed part as Mattys mom and the clich&eacute;s are kept mostly at arms length. The jokes are really well observed and everyone puts in a great performance - maybe because they were all enjoying themselves. Either way this is a film that put a smile on my face and kept it there - I hope it can do the same for you.",1423267200,2,1160,4.44131455399061

6230420,4,B00HW3EK8G,"This was a fun movie to watch. It's a pretty standard coming of age story, but one that also kind of challenges preconceived notions about what it means to be gay.
I loved that the gay teen is basically the antithesis of a stereotypical swishy gay person. He doesn't care about fashion, or the gym, or calling his friends ""gurl."" I loved his surprise at the wrestling match to find out that gay guys can like traditionally masculine stuff like pro wrestling.
But it's also a really good story about his best friend and how he tries, through his own somewhat selfish perspective, to adapt to his best bud being gay.

The character ""Matty"" (a baby bear in the making) is so fully realized and well-adjusted that he makes others around him seem to be the weird ones after he comes out as gay. Good performances by all actors involved, with more than a few chuckles. Nice, little, escapist comedy. You should expect to see more from these actors in the future.

This is the first film that I can remember recommending users to forego renting (currently only a 24 hour period is offered) and just outright buy it because you will view it again. The acting and production values are great and all the actors (including Dakota Johnson as Em and Megan Mullally as Mattys mom and Gary Cole as his dad) seem to naturally fit into their roles, even the flamboyant over-the-top character Blake (Bryce Hodgson, Diary of A Wimpy Kid).

When he goes behind the cardboard screen, which was his cocoon, a boy, in a butterfly suit is pulled upwards by a girl off stage using a rope and the boy in a harness. He swings around but knocks the cardboard over revealing Matty behind it, only in his underwear. He's embarrassed and runs out on stage. His friend Michael feels sorry for him, so strips down to his underwear and they take off running and leaving the gym, where the play was. When they are seniors Michael makes brownies, with pot in them, frosts them and writes on the top that they will eat them, when they both get laid, since both of them were virgins.  Matty has a girlfriend and comes out to her that he is gay, which she also accepts. They never had sex. Michael makes brownies, with pot, then frosts them and writes on they would share it, when they both lose their virginity.  Matty takes Michael up to the spot where lovers park and tells Michael he is gay. Michael accepts it and they have some adventures, while they both explore what it's like to be gay. They try out one gay bar, but it is too seedy and there is no guys there, which Matty might be interested in. They end up in another bar, which is a gay party bar. There are a lot of guys  there crowded on the dancing floor, dancing. They run into 2 of their teachers, from school, who turn out to be gay lovers. They wander around and find a room, where foam is pumped into the room and guys are dancing in there, in their underwear. Michael talks Matty into trying it out, so they take off all of their clothes, including their underwear and have fun in the foam room dancing in the nude. When they finally leave, a guy hits Michaels car, with his truck, damaging the rear driver's side. Michael is ticked off, gets out and is going to have it out with the guy who hit him. They argue and the other guy, Greg, who is really handsome, trips Michael and makes him fall down. Greg walks back to his truck and leaves. Later, Matty happens to run into Greg in a burger joint, where he is the next one in line. Pete, takes Matty's order then talks him into donating the 34 cents change, plus another $2, to the orphan charity they were running. When it is Greg's turn Pete talks him into donating also, before he even takes his order. Greg and Matty talk a little bit, then end up dating, when Matty finds out Greg is gay also. Prior to meeting Greg, Matty & Michael were always together. They even had their own band and were going to try out to be the band that plays for their school prom. Matty spends a lot of time, with Greg and doesn't spend as much time with Michael. Michael approaches Matty's old girlfriend to talk and they end up falling in love. They go up to where the lovers park and were just about to kiss, when Michael recognizes Matty's El Camino parked there. He thinks Matty is dating another girl and that's why he wasn't seeing him much anymore. He gets out of his car, marches over to Matty's truck and finds out Greg, the guy, who hit his car, is making out, with Matty. They have an argument and Matty gets mad that Michael is falling in love with Matty's old girlfriend. Michael is really upset, goes home and punches the brownies, which him and Matty had made together. Being as mad as he is at Matty, he takes the brownies over to Matty's house, where the family is just sitting down to eat supper, so they invite Michael to stay. During the meal they give each other dirty looks and Michael ends up outing him to his family, when they really didn't know yet. In the end Matty's old girlfriend calms Michael down and wants him to make up with Matty, because they had been close friends for so long. Matty's brother gets the gig, to play for prom and Matty decides to take his old girlfriend. Michael ends up talking to Matty's new friend Greg and they both decide to go to the prom, so they can talk to Matty. They get there and come in together, like they were gay lovers and everyone stares at them not believing what they are seeing. Michael tries to talk Matty's brother into letting him use his guitar, to sing a song. He sings the caterpillar song, which Matty was singing in the school play, when he ended up in his underwear, in front of everyone. Michael then gives a short speech about how there is nothing wrong with being gay. It ends up Matty lets Michael have his old girlfriend and he goes with Greg. They meet, in the parking lot, where Michael had the pan of pot brownies in the back of his car. They end up splitting the brownies between the 4 of them and that's how it ended.  I liked it because it was touching and there was no violence in the movie. It showed how difficult it is, to be young and gay.",1396742400,2,4789,4.276736493936053

6230511,4,B00HW3EK8G,I thought from the trailer that this was another coming out story. But it's more about how those around him process this information. And it's great because the lead character isn't portrayed as a stereotypical gay. It's nice to see an average guy that's gay.,1396310400,22,259,4.777777777777778
6230512,5,B00HW3EK8G,"This movie has fresh take on an coming of age, coming out story that has been told over, and over again. Great acting. Which is rare for gay cinematography. Will definitely watch again.",1395705600,,185,4.636363636363637
6230513,3,B00HW3EK8G,"Mike (Nicholas Braun) and Matty (Hunter Cope) have been close friends since elementary school. Their big plan is to lose their virginity by prom night and eat a huge pot brownie afterwards. This becomes more difficult as both break up with their girl friends. Then Matty comes out to Mike. While Matty is gay, he is not comfortable with the gay scene. Mike tries to help Matty get a guy, but has problems with life's recent changes.

The film is a comedy, which was amusing but not terribly funny. I was hoping for something more funny than guys taking their clothes off jumping around in foam. Perhaps the funniest aspect was when the two were part of a band that plays instrumental TV themes.

Okay as a cheap rental. You won't hurt yourself laughing.

6230514,5,B00HW3EK8G,"This movie was good and I thought it was a different take on the usual LGBT film.  I liked that it focused on the relationship between the two main characters, and yes they were looking for sex before prom but it was about more than that.  I would recommend it to anyone.",1394236800,,271,4.1923076923076925

I wish there were more like this type of movie - just a decent good movie with one or more gay characters in it.
