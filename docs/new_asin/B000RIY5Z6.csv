2867874,5,B000RIY5Z6,I loved this show back when it was on tv and I still love this show. The DVD got here in no time flat and I have had no issues with the quality.,1340668800,,144,3.393939393939394
2867875,5,B000RIY5Z6,"Great Product, came in quickly. This was a first series of Anime that got me into it and I was happy to find someone that still had it. I would definitely order from this seller again.",1336521600,,184,4.138888888888889
2867876,5,B000RIY5Z6,"DVDs have great video quality. The package arrived in one piece and there were no scratches. The DVDs arrived unwrapped in the collection series box. Audio quality is far above decent especially if you are using a surround sound system with this DVD collection. The extras on the DVDs are a bit short but they are worth to at least view. The DVDs offer an option for subtitles and Dialogue for the Japanese and English languages, so almost anyone can understand it.",1295827200,,465,4.682926829268292
2867877,4,B000RIY5Z6,"Good hard hitting and sexy action, the only problem I had with it was that it ended with out resolution but to get the full story simply read the manga. I would recomend this set to any mature viewer do to it's violence and adult situations which may be disturbing for some viewers.",1237939200,,282,4.339622641509434

 This anime is sexy,fast paced and full of fighting confused guys(what else is new?) and really hot babes. Natsume and her sister are members of a martial arts school and are members of about the only independent club in the school. Enter two street fighting style freshmen who want to terrorize the school and you have recipe for comedy and lots of fighting. Sometimes they get a little too involved in flashbacks, but over all pretty good. Highly recommend it.",1225843200,,644,6.402298850574713
2867879,4,B000RIY5Z6,"The anime series was great, but like many people have been saying, the series really doesn't END.  Instead, the anime just halts right when things are getting good! Unfortunately, there won't be a season two either because the original Japanese company that makes Tenjho Tenge decided to drop the project (I don't know the details).
I recommend that people watch this anime series, but either by renting or waiting until it is cheap cheap CHEAP.  THEN, read the mangas, which continue the story far beyond the anime.",1213056000,7,516,4.919540229885057
2867880,3,B000RIY5Z6,"This series had a great start! The characters were interesting and unique and the scenarios were unlikely/fantastical but that's why we watch these kind of shows, not for reality. The on-going story was fun and moved well, the flashbacks were intriguing and definately fueled the on-going end. Everything was really picking up with character developments, motivations and even extended family interactions then around 22 eps in, alla the sudden that's it. It ended The OVAs that followed kind of give you a hint as to where they're going with it but even THOSE don't actually close the story off....everything was going well until the 3rd Act, then it fell on its face, thus the weak 3star vote. I would have given this a 4 or even a 5 if they just concluded it....at all.",1205452800,5,772,4.768656716417911
2867891,4,B000RIY5Z6,i have been looking for this one for a long time so i was really happy when i found it thank you very much,1413936000,,106,3.4583333333333335
2867892,5,B000RIY5Z6,"The show was awesome but similar to what other reviews said the series really didn't lead to what you would expect it to, however I must say it did however complete A story, just not what you would think.",1403740800,,204,4.256410256410256
2867893,1,B000RIY5Z6,"This show is pretty good, it has some good fights (mainly dudeman getting the snot beat out of him and a bunch of fanservice) and a decent story with some well developed characters.  The issue is that the show never finished, it just ended right when things would have gotten good.  Basically the whole series sets itself up for nothing, read the manga its much better.

ALSO, i purchased this item from a Millionare_2013 thinking that it was a legit copy but alas it was a bootleg (a decent one at that).  Since then that seller has stopped using Millionare as his/her main account (due to bad ratings) and is instead using SMOKE-MART, so if you feel like buying illigel stuff then go right ahead, but i personally wouldnt support that BS.  The real version is here on this same page but is very unreasonably priced so im sure that some of you will go for this.

If you like stuff like this then check out Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple.  Also an unfinished anime adaption of a great manga but very very good nonetheless!",1391990400,2,1023,4.5271739130434785
2867894,5,B000RIY5Z6,It was great but I didn't like the ending to it. All in all it is a very good action show.,1374710400,,90,3.3333333333333335
2867895,2,B000RIY5Z6,"Very disappointed and I am an anime collector. I thought it would be more like Sekirei but it's better than Freezing, in my opinion. Just when I thought the characters were developing, it stopped and went south. It was slightly entertaining given the martial arts involved. Do Not Pay full price.",1367798400,,296,4.823529411764706
2867896,5,B000RIY5Z6,"At the moment i am really sick. Nasal infection. So i'm gonna be stuck in bed today, good thing my parcel came in today :) i totally reccommend the seller as well.",1359936000,,163,4.125
2867897,4,B000RIY5Z6,Not only is this series short but its incomplete. Don't get me wrong its actually a good series but the backstory that explains all the beef between everyone up until the current time is waaay better than the actual real series itself. There's fan service and plenty of action but the creators should've at least finished the series after the final battle. Rent this or preview it on you tube before buying.,1354924800,,407,4.666666666666667
2867898,4,B000RIY5Z6,"Souchirou and Bob come to Toudou Academy with the intention of taking over with their strength. They encounter the Jyuukenbu martial arts club. Souchirou and Bob are quickly stomped by the 3 members of the club. Impressed by their power the 2 friends join the club hoping to gain strength and learn the clubs secrets. Soon after that the Executive Enforcement Group starts a battle with the 5 club members. Will they be strong enough to fight them off?

This anime is pretty good. The first thing I noticed was that the voice actors were also major characters in Bleach. The second thing I noticed was that the series reminded me of Ikki Tousen and Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple. It's like a cross between the two. There aren't naked chicks getting it on like in Ikki Tousen, and there is more juicy cleavage than in Kenichi. As far as fan service goes it is kind of in-between.  The character designs are cool, and the fight scenes are intense. This series also has a good soundtrack. It's a pretty well rounded anime. Hot chicks, bad dudes, and lots of butt kicking. It is 26 episodes long, is English dubbed, and has subtitles if you would rather listen to the original Japanese. I really enjoyed watching Tenjho Tenge. I hope you do too.",1352678400,2,1243,4.619909502262443
2867899,4,B000RIY5Z6,"I bought this complete collection after watching the first two episodes on youtube. I was hooked on the series instantly. The animation is good and yet I haven't gotten a chance to watch this series I'm sure I'll love it in the end and it'll be a nice part of my collection.

Also just so you know. This complete collection has three dvd's which come on a single spindle which I hate. So I simply found a clear three disc case with a flap to it so the discs wouldn't be moving around and would remain intact. There's an english dub with english subtitle you can watch or a japanese with english subtitle or my personal favorite which is english dub with no subtitles. Kinda funny actually though. I've never read the manga and probably won't because I'm not really into manga that much. But besides that there are all 26 episodes on these disc. Episode 1-9 on disc one and episode 10-17 on disc two and finally episode 18- 26 on disc three. I believe it's something like that. LOL. Well I hope this helped anyone wanting to buy this collection of this series.",1351123200,,1059,4.430769230769231
2867900,5,B000RIY5Z6,"The series is going on the shelf next to Mars Daybreak, another anime series that I like, but with how far the storyline gets, I'm comparing it to History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi. If you love it, your gonna track down any manga that you can to finish the story.",1343520000,2,266,4.448979591836735

8200912,2,B000RIY5Z6,What is it wasn't as good as I thought it would,1467072000,,47,3.3636363636363638
8200913,5,B000RIY5Z6,"The series is quite amusing and has a lot of amazing fight scenes. The animation is beautiful and fluid (with more than a little borderline NSFW scenes) with a wonderfully complex story line. The DVDs hold plenty of episodes per disc, and while anime DVDs are often lacking in extra features, these do contain a few teasers and previews for other interesting series.

If you get disappointed by the lack of closure for the ending you may want to look into reading the manga. But this will certainly do for a fun action show.",1463356800,,524,4.574468085106383
8200914,4,B000RIY5Z6,"This is a show that easily could have earned 5 stars from me if it had any sort of conclusion. The pacing, animation, fights, music, characters, and story were all very enjoyable for me. Sure the plot of high school kids beating the crap out of each other isn't anything new, but I feel like the way it was done in this show is unique. It has a darker and more adult feel to it than any of the other series I've seen similar to it.

However, everything kind of falls apart in the last 3 episodes (the last two being OVAs). Essentially what they do is build up to a climax that we never actually see unless we read the manga. The last episode of the TV series (episode 24) feels like it rushes through a lot of things just to fit in what they wanted to. On top of that the OVAs just show the characters training for a tournament that we never get to see. Despite this issue, I'd still recommend a show. The ending might be bad...or rather non-existent, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy the journey.",1450396800,,1006,4.239583333333333

8200916,4,B000RIY5Z6,"This is a style over substance anime. Hits many of the same points you see in a lot of anime aimed at a male demographic. When guy falls into a naked girl in the shower and must marry him because he's the fist to, is your first tip off to this. It's a fun action anime. If you are looking for anything such as story, character progression, or a conclusion to the story, you won't find it.  It is very much in the vain of so bad it's enjoyable because everything is so well executed. Even the bomb the head theme song is worth seeing over and over again with each episode.

Just wish it was more then a fun distractions.",1442707200,,619,4.107438016528926
