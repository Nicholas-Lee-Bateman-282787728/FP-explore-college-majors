831254,5,6304291736,This is one of my favorite Leslie Sansone walking tapes. Its a brisk 15 minute mile with upbeat music. Leslie is her usual encouraging self. She leads a group of exercisers with simple steps that are varied enough to prevent boredom but low impact and easy to do. I pop in the tape for a quick walk after meals. It burns calories yet doesn't take a lot of time. At the end of the tape she leads you in a few minutes of toning exercises. A super video!,984268800,30,451,4.136363636363637
831255,5,6304291736,"As a working mother of two small children, I constantly used the excuse of ""not having enough time to exercise"". This video put me on the path back toward reclaiming my ""pre-baby"" self. It takes JUST 15  MINUTES to do the aerobic portion.  (Another 5 minutes of floor work  follows; it might take you a while to work up to that part.) The steps are  easy.  Leslie is upbeat.  There are women on this video who have lost 80  and 100 pounds!  I figured that if they could do that, I could certainly  stick with this program. I now do the tape twice a day -- once when I get  up in the morning, and once when I come home.  But, just doing the tape  once every day will start to change your body in about 12 weeks.  I  heartily recommend this tape for working moms!",956707200,42,761,4.123287671232877
831256,5,6304291736,"I started a diet and Leslie Sansone's walkaerobics program the same day.  Leslie is so encouraging that I didn't quit when I found the first day somewhat difficult.  My legs tired, but I slowed down as she suggested  during the video and was able to complete the one mile walk.  Since that  time, I have completed the one mile walk with increasing ease.  Now I have  the two mile walk video and the video for people over 40.  I love them all.  I have learned that low impact aerobics mixed with walking can be fun and  definitely contribute to weight loss.
I recommend this video to any one  who wants to exercise at home.  I go to the gym three days a week and do  the walkaerobics videos on alternate days.",943747200,49,708,4.312977099236641
831257,5,6304291736,"This tape helped me become motivated to exercise once again.  It is the just the right length of time especially after working all day. Other tapes are too long or to hard to follow. I enjoy her other tapes too. I like to  alternate between the 1 mile walk, the firming tape, and the 2 mile walk.  It is a winning combination.  I now have no excuse not to exercise  everyday.  The steps are easy to follow as well as fun.",940723200,28,421,4.135802469135802
831258,5,6304291736,"After reading about how each of us needs to work out aerobically plus firming, I decided to purchase her tapes.  I tried the ""new"" tapes that are out about breathing a certain way, holding your breath and  exercising at the same time -- these oxygen tapes -- not for me!  This is  so much more uncomplicated, easy to use, work at your own pace, etc.  She  is totally pleasant, happy personality and totally human, a lot of fun.  Her staff members are nice and so are the other people in her tapes.  Her  videos with ""mile"" walks are the ones you work at your own pace  and work up to the end of the miles indicated.  But they are not hard at  all!  Better than walking outside -- you are in the privacy of your own  home.  Buy them and be happy you did!",922320000,6,753,4.131944444444445

831363,5,6304291736,"I bought this for my father, a lifelong athlete who has gradually been slowed by the infirmities that accumulate over time, when one has been injured here and there along the way.  After examining and rejecting various classes and discs as being either unrealistically demanding for a senior, or insultingly gentle (his words, not mine); we heard about the great results many older or injured people have had with Leslie Sansone's Miracle Miles.  This one hit the sweet spot.  Dad is impressed and says that -- by being sensible and going at his own pace -- he knows he can do this.  I am shocked for two other reasons:  firstly, the price is an unbeatable value. Secondly, it is very challenging, to the extent that I had some trouble keeping up myself.

No, I know I will NEVER USE THIS and I'm so glad I watched it before I went downstairs at 4:30 in the morning before work,  to exercise.  I would have been so disappointed.

831489,5,6304291736,"Excellent, even still in 2014.  Okay, I love Leslie Sansone dvds. Over the years, I have tried and kept dozens of her workouts. When I'd get tired of one, I'd get on a quest for a new one. I picked this Miracle Mile up at a thrift shop--- even though old--- just because I love Leslie.  This is great!  It is a hoot to see the old clothing and Mary as a younger woman, etc. (she is the one who kicks your tail with the cross over knee lifts in her 4 mile firm series) but Leslie is pure gold in this one.  She does some different moves from newer videos and the mile goes by so quickly! It is peppy, upbeat and the moving keeps momentum going.  Everyone is happy to be doing the dvd in the video. You feel like they are your friends by the end of the workout.  My husband and I love it to put in when we just have a few min.  She even has a 5 min. toning section after the workout that is not all that easy to me!  Pushups!  I have never mastered them, so if you add this one--- what a workout.  I have had some of her older ones that I got rid of when the newer boosted ones came out or I ""outgrew"" them.  This one is a keeper.  I still love to do the 4 mile dvd's and maybe a 5 mile one (but the 4 are my favorite that I get my best workout with)  but this one is right on up there as a keeper.  I still use it to this day in 2014.  It's also a quick one to put in like after supper, etc.  if you want to add another mile to your day. It's one that you do not dread and if you have just a few min. OR if you are just starting out with Leslie or in home walking --- there is no better one to start with.  Any age can do this one.  Just give it a try!",1404518400,4,1651,3.681948424068768

This DVD is all that saves my disposition.  Walking has actually become bearable.  (Never thought I'd use those words in the same sentence.)

831529,5,6304291736,"This miracle mile is where it all started for me about 21 months and dozens and dozens of lbs ago.  I'm exactly half my original size now.  I'm still not able to write down my starting weight, but I cringe when I look at old pictures of myself.  I had procrastinated for years with starting an exercise program.  I had ordered a couple of VHS tapes I had seen on an infomercial but never used them.  Finally, I hit rock bottom when I bought one of those scales that only went up to a certain number.  I was shocked when I kept getting an error message which meant I was too heavy for the capacity.  I had known about Leslie Sansone, but I never took it seriously.  When I read the results of others I decided to try it.  I started with this Miracle Mile and could barely get through it.  I couldn't do all the moves, but I kept moving.  Leslie said ""Just keep moving, march in place, you will reach your goal if you don't quit.  You can't do this wrong.""  Well, she was right.  Very quickly I found that I became addicted to it, because I was actually enjoying it.  Leslie's talking were words of encouragement and the time just flew by and so did the weeks.  I walked every day, and then started walking twice a day.  The weight just started falling off.  My clothes became huge.  They looked like clown's clothes.  I've had to replace my entire wardrobe twice and I'm still losing effortlessly, only about 25 more to go.  My metabolism has changed. I get compliments galore!  I can eat comfortably and not gain weight so easily.  Sometimes I can do as much as 7 miles a day.  When I was obese, I would drive by people walking for exercise and wish I could do it too, but time, safety, and embarrassment were always factors.  I haven't missed a day of exercise since I started.  It's convenient, easy and I don't worry if it's raining, snowing, dark out, or what time of day it is--I just WALK!  Starting an exercise program is the hardest thing.  Leslie makes it easy.  Now for me it's just a way of life.  If I feel like a mile I do a mile, if I want to do more, I do it.  I'm in control now!  If you're obese like I was, or need to decrease blood pressure, blood sugar, or cholesterol, give this a try.  Walking is the only medication I use.  Try this.  You won't be sorry.",1208822400,34,2277,4.216279069767442
831530,5,6304291736,"Growing up in the 90s as a heavy set girl, life was always terribly difficult for me. I would be teased, laughed at, and constanly reminded of my large size. freshman year of High School I had enough of the bullying, the names, and the havoc it was causing in my life (emotionally and physically). You couldn't image how hard it was having to dread Gym Class, and then kids laughing at you for a whole hour.

My mother had Leslie Sasone's Walk Away the Pounds Dvd's so I figured ""What have I got to loose?"". I was a young teenager who wanted change from her awful past so I decided I would make a start now.

Months later, Leslie Sansone changed my life. I was 205lbs, and with the help of the Miracle Mile I had dropped down to 145. Thats a size 16 to a size 10! You cant imagine all the attention I got when I went back to school my first day of sophomore year! I felt better, more confident, and healthier. With a healthier eating style and exercise with this workout I was able to change so much I had wanted to all my life. I am now almost 19 and for 5 years have been dedicated to Leslie Sansone's Miracle Mile Walk.

I would reccomend it over and over again to anyone of everyone who wants to feel healthier and better about themselves. It was easy for me to stick to because it was low impact, but had a huge affect! The music was fun and great to keep up with- and the workout was not at all confusing. Very easy, fun, and effective!

I enjoy both the shorter length, different moves and her keeping her very irritating chatter to a minimum.

I only mention it because some people can't handle the dated look.  This video is faster paced than most of Leslie's newer stuff and there is more of a variety to the moves.  Not that the moves are ""dancy"" or complicated, there is just more traveling and a couple variations on her usual four steps which I like because I was getting a little bored with a couple of the Walk the Pounds videos.  It really feels like a very fun, beginners' aerobics class.  There is a decent stretch afterward and then a five minute toning ""bonus"" section consisting of pushups, squats, and crunches.  Simple, but quick and doable and can be accessed separately in the DVD menu if you wanted.  All in all, this really is a great, complete workout by Leslie.

831560,4,6304291736,"I have always hated aerobic exercise and that's why I'm so out of shape.  I can do toning and stretching, but bring my heart rate up and I'm miserable.  However, with my lack of aerobic exercise taking a toll on my health, I realized that something needed to change.  The problem:  lack of motivation.  It's hard to make myself walk outdoors when it's cold/hot/rainy/windy etc.  It's hard to make myself do an exercise tape that makes me so winded and exhausted that I can't even finish it, so I feel like a failure.

Finally here is an exercise regimen I can actually do on a regular basis, no excuses.  I can finish this DVD in 15 minutes and feel like I actually accomplished something.  The moves are simple and low-impact.  I can do the workout barefoot on the carpet with no problems.  She always emphasizes that it's ok to slow down and just march in place if that's what you need to do to keep moving.

She also includes a short toning section at the end.  I really don't like this section.  It includes three exercises:  lunges, push ups, and crunches.  I detest lunges because they hurt my knees and I can't really do push ups, so I prefer to do something else for toning.",1111276800,14,1182,4.427906976744186
831561,5,6304291736,"Well I VERY overweight and have been looking for something low impact, convienent(sp?).  I work long hours and had been trying to got to the gym during lunch, that didn't work.  I also tried water aerobics, which I loved but was hell on my hair.

So I discovered the lesile sansone when I was looking for beginner yoga tape.  I bought it the same day and I was hooked. I do it as soon as I get home.  It takes all of 15-20 min and then I can go on with the rest of my night.  I can get through the whole tape, but I stop about 3 times to catch my breathe.  Once I can get through with no stops I'll move to the 2 mile tape.

The moves are easy and I love that she says you aren't hear to learn dance moves, and encourages you to move at your own pace.

The tapes are alil dated looking (someone commented in a review I read when I was deciding to buy), but I didn't buy this for style I bought it get in shape and it seems to be working.

Anyway, if you are someone who hates going to t gym, or excercise classes when you seem out of place, then this is for you.",1107129600,8,1062,3.8525345622119818
831562,4,6304291736,This was not a bad workout video. I hate to exercise but at this point in my life I really needed to do something to get in shape. I didint want the typical workout videos that are avilable on the market. My God! Who could keep up with those guys if the only exercise you get is lifting the remote control to the tv daily! I mean I get tired just walking up a flight of stairs of running after my 2 yr old.  Housework was even exhausting for me. This video was easy to follow and it is the perfect start for anyone who wants to get in shape and/or loose some weight. I have only been at it for a few weeks now but I feel better already. I would recommend this to anyone who is a beginner at exercise and wants to get in shape.,1003795200,6,726,3.9054054054054053
831563,5,6304291736,This is the best thing that has happened to me. My feet are a big problem and I was thrilled to find this tape and be able to walk in my home and spare my feet the impact of cement walks. Also the best part is I started to feel the results fast I'm starting to get a waist again in a matter of 1 week.  I'm sending for the 2 mile walk and inter-change with the two of them.,994896000,11,373,3.6625
