1783285,5,B00006JU8E,"This is a great documentry about one of our cloesest living relatives: the mountain gorilla. This film is full of great entertainment and wonderful scenes.

In Rwanda, we see a family of gorillas that is ruled by a powerful silverback, named Umigumi. We watch as his troop get along in their seemingly peaceful lives in the mountain rainforests of Rwanda, Africa.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves gorillas and apes in general. It's a great price for a great movie. And trust me, it is worth the price for such an entertaining and beautiful documentry.",1222300800,7,567,4.775510204081633
1783286,5,B00006JU8E,"A wonderful film! For me, a great nature documentary transports you into the world of the subject and Mountain Gorilla does just that. I think that my blood pressure was significantly lowered while viewing this great film, with it's fascinating subject matter and absolutely breathtaking scenery. My only complaint is that the film was too short, at 39 minutes.",1216080000,6,361,5.135593220338983
1783287,5,B00006JU8E,"The history, biology and photography makes this DVD well-worth owning.  These beautiful endangered beings need us to help tell their story.  I highly recommend this quality presentation.",1168300800,23,186,5.851851851851852
1783288,5,B00006JU8E,"This is NOT Mighty Joe Young or King Kong, PERIOD! This is a documentary of mountain gorillas. Repeat, a DOCUMENTARY! This film was intended to educate people on the daily life of the gorillas, not provide scripted action. It is only boring to those who do not appreciate the gorillas for who they are, and wish to learn about them. That said, this film does what the producers intended it to do. Hopefully, people WILL learn about the plight of the mountain gorillas, and do their part in the preservation process. We cannot afford to lose these magestic creatures.",1115251200,55,566,4.7272727272727275
1783289,5,B00006JU8E,This is one of the best videos available that provides a lot of real amazing footage of these amazing critically endangered species. I first rented this DVD and then immediately bought it. A must have. The only thing it did not mentioned is that you can help support the anti-poaching patrols and rangers that protect the park by going to the Dian Fossey website gorillafund.org.,1112832000,47,379,4.846153846153846
1783290,3,B00006JU8E,"I've heard primatologists say that their research is really boring for the first couple months, before they get to know the fascinating web of social structure of the primate society that they study.  This DVD supports those claims.
The writers try to make it interesting, giving names to the gorillas, but it's hard to keep them straight (now was that Mbugwe grooming Gmubwe, or vice versa?).  But I left with the impression that gorillas spend most of their time eating leaves and relaxing.  That may be true, but I think that it's the job of the directors to make eating leaves and relaxing look really really interesting.  Maybe get some MTV style quick cuts instead of the lazy slow tracking shots through the jungle.
Also, some gorilla fights would be fun.
It seems that the film doesn't seem to take advantage of the Imax format.  But maybe I just think that because I am watching it on my 13 inch computer monitor.",1058659200,6,922,4.666666666666667
1783291,4,B00006JU8E,"This was very similiar to the movie ""Gorilla's in the Mist"", as far as the natural habitat of the mountain gorilla's and their habits go.
They seem very easy to love, and I can see why Diane Fossi devoted her life to them and wanted to stay with them at all costs.",1387843200,,264,4.096153846153846
1783292,5,B00006JU8E,"This critically endangered GENTLE ape was given a terrible reputation over 50 years ago.  THANK YOU HOLLYWOOD - YOU DID IT AGAIN!

Those who understand gorillas call them ""the gentle giants"", for good  reason.  Unlike another great ape - the human being - Mountain Gorillas mind their own business, are good parents and do absolutely nothing to harm other creatures.  They are fruit and leaf-eaters.  And because of these ""gentle"" qualities, they are hunted and killed by people.

Thank God for Dian Fossey.  Her organization is doing everything it can to educate local - and world - populations and has provided help to these magnificent animals in many ways.  Until she started research on gorillas, the world was ""educated"" by Hollywood, rather than people with minds.

Good for IMAX, for trying to reverse all the misconceptions.",1386892800,,833,5.0588235294117645
1783293,3,B00006JU8E,I expected a lot more from the dvd.  I wanted to know about how many of them are left in the wild. etc.,1377993600,,103,3.4782608695652173
1783294,3,B00006JU8E,"I was a little disappointed that it seemed to be a documentary instead of a movie.

I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to learn about the gorilla.",1374969600,,153,4.275862068965517
1783295,3,B00006JU8E,"Nice, and wonderful filming. It's ok, and my expectation was more.
Altho a nice dvd to own, it lacked keeping your interest.",1364947200,,124,4.681818181818182
1783296,4,B00006JU8E,"I had recently been to Uganda to ""sit with the gorillas"" and wanted a good documentary on them.  Although Mountain Gorillas was on the family in Rwanda, I was very pleased with it as there are 6 families who roam between Uganda/The Congo/Rwanda.",1364860800,2,245,4.6976744186046515
1783297,5,B00006JU8E,"Although nothing compares with spending time in person these amazing beings, this film is as good a substitute as there is.  It is stunning in its beauty while giving viewers the chance to get to know mountain gorillas up close.  You'll want to watch it over and over again and will never forget what is one of the most important conservation issues of our time.",1364256000,2,362,4.553846153846154
1783298,5,B00006JU8E,I saw this presentation at an IMAX theater and had to have it on DVD.  Incredible images that must be seen to be believed!,1363910400,5,122,4.083333333333333
1783299,5,B00006JU8E,I work at the zoo with the Apes.  I am always looking for something on DVD or in book form to donate for our silent auction every year.  I look for this one every year.,1290988800,3,168,3.7714285714285714
1783300,3,B00006JU8E,"Great footage of the Gorillas. Little dull on the narration, little dull on the action. I got a feeling the producers wanted the Apes to appear as big docile animals, always. Little slow on action, but informative. Usually I-Max delivers in a big way, but, this is their three star production.",1236643200,2,293,4.764705882352941

7970896,3,B00006JU8E,"The narrator's voice is so melancholy! It makes the gorillas feel like pathetic creatures rather than the powerful, amazing ones that they are. I do get that there shouldn't be constant talking but she just said a sentence or two at a time and just did not hold my attention.",1428796800,,275,4.52
7970897,5,B00006JU8E,"Students liked this.  I used this in conjunction with ""Gorillas in the Mist"" in my High school Biology class particularly when I was gone and had a substitute covering the class.  I would include a writing assignment to go along with the viewing.",1418860800,,246,4.6976744186046515
