4392269,5,B004K4FUQQ,"Great film, Aasif Mandvi!

I went to see this movie with my friends and we had such a good time. It's charming, whimsical and all around uplifting. It inspired me to go home and make Indian food. I didn't because that requires a lot of spices so instead I just ordered it. Either way, loved the movie and so glad that it's FINALLY coming out on DVD. Can't wait to see it again.",1300838400,2,377,4.164383561643835

Not heavy fare, it is a fun farce with a handful of characters recognizable in many local ""ethnic"" neighborhood restaurants. Perhaps it is too light in its appreciation of the subtleties of garam masala and the problems between generations in immigrant families, but I am always willing to watch Aasif Mandvi.

4392273,5,B004K4FUQQ,"Today's Special is such a delight. It's surprisingly hilarious (I say surprising because I don't generally associate ""food"" movies with comedy - but this one is genre crossing :)) You will guffaw while salivating for all the gorgeous Indian food being whipped up in the most beautiful ways - which may cause some drool to be flung on the friends with whom you're watching - but it is ALL worth it.  Invite your buddies over, order take out and spend an evening in with Today's Special. You will not regret it.",1300665600,2,509,4.593406593406593
4392274,5,B004K4FUQQ,"Most of the films in the same genre as ""Today's Special""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Today-s-Special/dp/B004K4FUQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Today's Special</a>&nbsp;(Indian-Pakistani immigrant/2nd generation) bravely address important issues, for example, interracial romance/marriage (""Bend it Like Beckham"", ""Bhaji on the Beach""). All of them highlight, often in quite serious ways, the tension between immigrant parents and their children (""East is East""). Watching these films is generally accompanied with a certain amount of malaise at the worst and deep introspection at the least. (Allow me to explain.) This is because most Indian/Pakistani immigrant films make it their moral responsibility to explore, again and again and in serious ways, immigrant issues which resonate, on a very personal level with many viewers. The result: viewers like myself (2nd generation Indian) are forced to deliberate said issues. While contemplation of one's community and one's self is a noble activity, it can become quite a chore when one simply wants to enjoy a film. After watching all immigrant/2nd generation Indian-Pakistani films since ""Mississippi Masala"", I am frankly tired of thinking about interracial marriage and societal expectations (""Monsoon Wedding""). For one, I've thought about these issues enough, thank you very much, and two, when these issues are portrayed on the big screen, their portrayal has become more and more formulaic. Can't I just watch a 'feel-good' film about my community, laugh a little and call it a night? Why must I be bombarded with issue after immigrant issue? If you are like me or if you are tired of the formulaic, often overly serious/emotional films about immigrant experiences then you WILL LOVE ""Today's Special""! Don't get me wrong, it addresses immigrant issues but not in a formulaic, uncomfortably serious or boring way. The film really does promise and deliver a good time, good laughs and a light-hearted feeling throughout. ""The Daily Show's Aasif Mandvi is nothing less than hilarious; Naseerrudin Shah gives a stellar performance and is as funny as his co-stars; Harish Patel and Madhur Jaffrey make a very comedic couple. Last but not least, the film revolves around something which we all love, food! Your mouth will water and your heart will laugh! I am happy I got to see this film in the theatre and I am very happy it is coming out on DVD! I can see myself popping this film into my dvd player any day of the week when I want to smile, laugh and stoke the digestive fire!",1300320000,18,2578,5.43142144638404
4392275,5,B004K4FUQQ,"I really loved this movie!  Got to see it in New York at the Sunshine Theater and the audience howled!  Its funny, sweet, charming, and I found myself moved to tears.  Like Babette's Feast, Eat Drink Man Woman, and other great culinary comedies (can't forget Big Night!), Today's Special hits all the right spots, and leaves you feeling hungry for more.

The performances are strong, with Naseeruddin Shah as Akbar stealing the show.  Who knew Madhur Jaffrey could be so funny!  Harish Patel, best known for Run Fat Boy Run, is at turns very funny, and tender.  The music was fun, and the food was definitely a star in this film.  I also loved the soundtrack of old Bollywood Songs, and the gypsy jazz score.

I'm going to pick this up, order Indian take out and watch it with my friends :)",1299456000,,790,4.507042253521127
4392276,5,B004K4FUQQ,"This movie was an unexpected charmer! It's the story of a second generation east Indian sous chef, whose mother keeps trying to arrange a marriage for him. He expects to get a promotion as Executive chef of his own restaurant.  But they tell him he doesn't have the passion they're looking for. So he quits, and decides to go to Paris to study under a master. Then his immigrant father, whose ethnic restaurant is failing, has a heart attack. Our disgruntled hero, whose knowledge of the cuisine of his heritage is limited, is forced to ask for help from a cab driver who claims to have superb cooking skills. In the mix is a girl from the restaurant from which he resigned, and the characters who hang out at his father's restaurant. I loved the heart and soul of this movie.  I'm a life coach, and there were some very believable and tender moments. Yes, the plot was a bit predictable, but the humanity of the characters and their interrelationships drew me in.  If you're tired of some of Hollywood's overly self-conscious attempts to be ""relevant,"" give this one a try.  It's a ""little movie that could.""",1296518400,26,1109,4.614213197969543

4392288,4,B004K4FUQQ,"Though my acquaintance with cuisine is limited largely to eating it, this delightful little food flick drew me in and held my attention through its somewhat formulaic but whimsically executed plot line.

Indians can poke fun at Indian idiosyncrasies as, well, as only Indians can. There's plenty of that, almost but not quite to the point of slapdash humor as Samir (Aasif Mandvi)the emphatically assimilated son of a small-time New York restaurenteurfinds out that Indian cooking is not below him after all. In the process, he finds the success, the love, and the satisfaction that had eluded his pursuit of the American dream, or at least of the New York variation on that theme.

If every good story requires a shadow, life is usually not sparing in obliging. Samir's family lives under the shadow of the unexplained death of his brother and the hold in the hearts of Samir's match-making mother and legacy-craving father that their late son's absence has torn.

The star turn in this picture is Naseerudin Shah's 'Akbar', the bohemian taxi-driver cum great chef who probably *has* cooked for Indira Ghandi, just as he's claimed. He came to his kitchen mastery somehow, and cooking for the Great Ones emerges as at least as plausible as all other explanations as Akbar gains Samir's respect, teaches him to cook from the soul, and then departs for Akron, Ohio, leaving Samir to do just as his improbably tutor has exhorted him to do.

Not an action flick, this little film may well fill up the evening of a viewer who relishes the cultural quirks and nuances that make people-watching one of life's great sporting endeavors.

Enjoy!",1468281600,,1635,4.909420289855072
4392289,5,B004K4FUQQ,"I can add another food and romance movie to my list of ""I love it"" movies.  This one is more light-hearted than some....Like Water for Chocolate...for example, but communicates the same ideas that cooking is art and emotion and memory and not just technique and sustenance.  I love the second generation immigrant story line and how those generational differences and cultural challenges play out.  At the same time, the theme of parental expectations and a child's desire to forge their own path is universal.  How many of us have thought we were so independent from our own parents and yet feel a pull a toward those things that pulled at their hearts as well.  The son tries to make breaks from his Indian heritage and yet he goes on into the restaurant business that his parents raised him in.  In the end, that shared experience drew him back to his roots where he can reclaim his heritage (the old) and embrace the new (a love not of his heritage or religion).  What a sweet, sweet story.

4392312,4,B004K4FUQQ,"No question these days with the craze for food shows and the creation of a whole cable channel devoted to just about every aspect of culinary preparation that you cannot go wrong if you are a filmmaker in producing a film centered on the struggle to make a name for yourself in the business. Make it slightly exotic, make it slightly multi-cultural, make it slightly intergenerational, make it in polyglot New York City, Brooklyn better these days than Manhattan for the diversity look add in the immigrant quest back story into the mix and you have an enjoyable film  labelled appropriately enough Todays Special (which also is a recurring motif within the film)

Heres how the foodie craze plays out in this one. Samir a son of an Indian immigrant has been working his ass off just like everybody else in mostly low pay, long hours, little thanks restaurant industry in a high end noveau cuisine as a sou chef expecting to move onward and upward due to his hard work and diligence. No soap, no soap when the king hell chef gives the upward mobile job to some kid and to add insult to injury says Samir doesnt have the magic hand to be a great chef. In a fit of hubris Samir quits with the idea, a very good idea at that, of going to Paris and making a name for himself there. No soap, no soap again because Samirs father, an owner of a failing Indian cuisine restaurant has a heart attack when Samir tells him his plans. So naturally all plans on hold Samir just has to take care of his fathers business, something he had been running away from all his life.

Since the push on this one is a rags to riches story, the failing endeavor to successful endeavor variant which Hollywood and Bollywood loves Samir turns this restaurant around. First by getting a max daddy chef posing as a cabdriver to end all chefs to come and work for him. Everything is on the upswing from there, the business starts getting better, the max daddy chef teaches Samir a few things and Samirs love life takes an upswing when a foxy-looking young Anglo woman who used to work at Samirs old place gives him some play. End of story. Well not quite the end since Samir has to go through a process to become that magical chef that was hidden within him. Worse though is that Samirs father tries to undercut him by trying to sell the place. But as in all things culinary the tensions get worked out and all the intergenerational, multi-cultural, and striving immigrant have a happy ending. Yes definitely a feel good movie.",1448236800,,2497,4.495594713656388

It was competently acted, and the Indian taxi driver/chef (Akbar) steals the scenes when he's in them, but the premise is a little far-fetched:  that a trained chef (Samir) would panic at the thought of becoming a chef in a family restaurant that he presumably grew up in, as if he never learned anything about cooking that type of food while growing up, yet has enough interest in food to go to culinary school and become a chef.

4392352,4,B004K4FUQQ,"*SPOILER ALERT*

This is a great movie my wife and I very much enjoy.

Aasif Mandavi plays a chef, Samir, who is a talented if less than creative sous chef at a prime New York restaurant. He expects to be head chef at his bosses' new restaurant, which is set to open soon. Instead, the owner chooses a much younger, ""hipper"" chef for the top job, pissing him off. In the meanwhile, some Indian stereotypes abound (traditional family, mother trying to arrange his marriage, etc.), but they are portrayed adroitly and with humor. This movie is good at humor at its own expense.

A family emergency results in Samir taking responsibility and temporarily running his family's Indian restaurant, which is tired and in disrepair. Samir reluctantly takes the reins, and Naseeruddin Shah as Akbar, and Jess Wexler, as Carrie, serve as his muses. What transpires is a feel good comedy.",1394755200,,876,4.826666666666667

Mr. Shah has a great role and plays it beautifully. I liked the three uncles, the musicians, the older couple who ""tell all their friends""  and even the long-suffering head waiter.

4392368,4,B004K4FUQQ,"This film popped up as a recommend on Netflix, and the description of Indian food and cooking got me curious.  What I was NOT expecting was a warm, sweet, and very funny confection of a film that is not only about Indian cooking/food ... but also about father-son relationships, love, and how following your dream may also include having the faith to stay on the detours life sometimes throws you.  A young Indian man/chef in Manhattan named Samir (Aasif Mandvi, who also co-wrote the script), a bit of a hot-head who quits his job when passed over for a promotion, is forced to give up his plans to relocate to Paris to study the culinary arts when his father suffers a heart attack ... and Samir has to take over the family's restaurant.  The problem?  Samir has never cooked an Indian dish, and indeed has never had the slightest bit of interest in either the food of his culture OR his father's tiny little restaurant.  A chance meeting with an Indian cab driver changes everything, and through food Samir finds his zest for both life and his culture all over again.  A wonderful comedy/drama that will leave you both hungry and feeling good inside - with, major, a tear or two shed before the credits roll.  Loved it.",1356912000,,1222,4.577981651376147

It was a charming movie and with warmth and humor. I recommend it highly.

4392371,4,B004K4FUQQ,"This is a lovely, unpretentious but very successful film about a second generation Indian young man who has to deal with the problems that face many children of immigrants. .

Samir has a job in a swanky restaurant in Manhattan and has his eye on greater things than his father's humble restaurant in Queens.  As fate would have it, just when he is about to go to Paris to intern with a big time French chef (he hopes) and blaze a big career for himself, his father has a heart attack.  The results are predictable but the story is carried out with a lot of heart.

The cast is first rate, led by Aasif Mandu as Samir.  A lesser actor might have not won audiences as well as he did.  His performance is just right--doesn't overdo it--he's great.  The part of his love interest--a soft blond--his perfect opposite--is a bit overacted but she looks right for the part.  The magic fellow, a sort of Peter Pan who drops from the sky just when he's needed, is perfect. He's played by Naseerudden Shah and steals every scene in which he appears.  It's a stock role but Mr. Shah is so good that he far transcends  the type.  There are other supporting actors who add a lot to the warmth and humor of the film.  I loved the three old guys who play cards in the restaurant all day.  And 'special mention to the kitchen helper who says ""yes.""  He is a small gem of a character, again very nicely played.

The script is not groundbreaking but it is nicely told.  The shots of Queens (I think it is) are wonderful. In all, I think that the simple charm of the story will win over anyone willing to open his heart.",1348963200,,1601,4.304347826086956

All are gems in their own right. One aspect of this film that I particularly love is that the main characters are muslim and that these muslims are portrayed in a positive light! That's something we could certainly use more of in today's cinema! All too often muslims are portrayed as terrorists and zealots. Granted some muslims are terrorists but so are some other religious fundamentalists. It's just a nice change to see nonfundamentalist muslims in everyday life. Trust me. This film is a real gem! A well written screenplay brought to life on the screen by a solid group of actors. I hope that after having watched this indie gem you'll have the reaction that I had and want to watch it again!

4392374,5,B004K4FUQQ,"Samir is a dedicated chef in a French restaurant who leaves because he is passed over for a promotion.  Meanwhile his father who owns the Tandoori Palace has a heart attack and Samir has to step in to try to save the business and never mind he knows or cares nothing about Indian cuisine.  A local cabbie by the name of Akbar, a man of the world and also a talented chef comes to the rescue and in so doing introduces Samir to a style of cooking that wakes up his sense of smell and creativity as well as putting some passion into the food.  The cast includes Madhur Jaffrey, author of many cookbooks, who plays Samir's mother always trying to hook him up with a prospective bride.  She is perfectly cast for this role and definitely adds a lot of dry humor to the plot.  The love interest of Samir, Carrie, a prep chef at Samir's former restaurant also makes Samir open up to his buried emotions regarding his late brother, father, and his overall aloof attitude about cooking in general.  ""Don't think so much"", Akbar tells him just let it come from your head, heart, and stomach as he points to each one.  The whole cast of actors most of them unknowns to me did a great job, including the three old guys who hang out in the restaurant every day and ultimately support Samir in his endeavors to make a go of his father's restaurant.  The filming was very realistic and captured the ethnicity of a New York small neighborhood.  All in all it was one of these uplifting, feel good films that are great to see once in awhile!",1345766400,,1525,4.360424028268551
4392375,5,B004K4FUQQ,"This is a predictable, silly movie, full of cinematic cliches and stereotyped characters.  It's also delightfully entertaining -- lovable even.  The plot is pretty basic: Samir is at odds with traditional Indian dad. He's American, not Indian, and a sous chef at a hip French restaurant. Passed over for a promotion (because his cooking is good but lacks passion) he quits, hoping to go to Paris and work with one of the great chefs there. Dad's heart attack changes everything. Instead he needs to run the family restaurant, a hole in the wall curry palace in Queens.

If you know 74th Street in Jackson Heights, or Steinway Street in Astoria, or the main drag in Corona or Flushing or Elmhurst, you've seen and probably eaten at the Tandori Palace (and the Afghan and Pakistani Palace, maybe even a Nepali or Tibetan Palace...and you know that ""palace"" in any of those languages translates to ""For god's sake, don't look in the kitchen.""  The neighborhoods are home to immigrants from all over, and most recently East Asia and the Middle East, and every block has two or three Palaces.  Next to the Greek gyro place, German deli, Korean BBQ, Israeli falafal stand, papusa cart and Chinese noodle joints. The food ranges from decent to astounding, and it's cheap. And exotic...it's fun to take a look behind the scenes sometimes, and this movie gives us that peek.

With the help of a mysterious deus ex machina in the form of Akbar, an Indian cab driver/import-export dealer/orphanage director/master chef, Samir finds his passion, reconciles with his dad, and saves the family business. And finds love.  Akbar teaches him that cooking is not about recipes. It is a sensual art and should seduce or comfort. Cooking should come from the head, the heart and the stomach, not a book. Akbar is a bit larger than life, a philospher who gets most of his wisdom from fortune cookies, he cooked for Indira Ghandi, hung out with Queen Elizabeth, was pals with the Shah of Iran and a buddy to countless heads of state, maharajas and maharanis.  Every life should have an Akbar in it.

""Today's Special"" is such a sweet movie, I found it easy to forgive theoccasional falls from grace. The good parts outnumber the bad and there are several moments that are pure gold.  When Akbar and Samir go shopping for spices, Akbar describes them in a way that is poetic, sexy and unforgettable. And accurate.  ""Cumin is a saucy wench who gives great pleasure, but beware...she herself is never satisfied."" That's quite true...the temptation to go too far with cumin is sometimes irresistable.  Coriander, on the other hand, is ""a maiden walking through a lemon grove by the sea."" Keep this in mind next time you smell some fresh coriander and see if it's not right. And cinnamon? Cinnamon is that crazy aunt or uncle, loud and noisy and fun...but a little goes a long way.

The best scene in the movie is a dinner at Akbar's house. The food makes you hungry, and the Three Geezers(old timers who hang out at the Tandori Palace) will melt your heart.  Their dancing is laugh out loud funny and just flat out wonderful.  The scene is so full of charm and warmth, we watched it twice.

The cast is excellent. Aasif Mandvi plays Samir. Aasif is a regular as the befuddled ""Asian,"" ""Middle Eastern"" or ""Muslim"" correspondent on The Jon Stewart Show.  The film is loosely based on his one-man play, ""Sakina's Restaurant,"" which won an Obie.  Samir's mother is played by Madhur Jaffrey, the renowned cookbook author and food writer. She gets no help from the script, which has her as the typical stereotyped Indian mother, desperate to see her son married. But Jaffrey has such a bright,expressive face and natural warmth, she brings depth and charm to a role that would otherwise be ignored.  His father is the well known Indian actor Harish Patel, notable for being about as wide as he is tall, and who does a creditable job in the role. Akbar is superbly played by Naseeruddin Shah, who was also excellent in Monsoon Wedding.  He steals every scene he is in...except those with the three geezers. They are heart-stealers as well as scene stealers.  One of them, Kumar Pallana, will be recognized as the crabby (but ultimately self-sacrificing) janitor in ""The Terminal.""

A friend came over and literally forced me to watch this movie a few weeks ago when I was feeling very sad. It would not have been on my radar otherwise, and it would have been my loss.  If it lifted my spirits on that day when my heart was in pieces, I think it will cheer anyone.  Don't expect a brilliant and original plot, or some new height in cinematic intellectualism.  It's just a sweet, endearing movie. No one gets shot, no car chases, no vampires, explosions, spies or police corruption. Just escapism.  How bad is that.  But if you want a little balm for a sore heart, if you need a little lift, or just want to spend 90 minutes smiling, watch it.  And you might want to keep a menu from an Indian restaurant...one that delivers...handy. Trust me, you'll want it.",1343347200,3,5025,4.705479452054795

4392382,2,B004K4FUQQ,"Good actors and great sets cannot salvage a lame little story filled with Hollywood clichs. I'm not sure I've ever seen a film with so many of the hoary old set-pieces: generational conflict, angst and exasperation caused by the old-school immigrant parents, stressed young man hitting a career wall, cross cultural love, follow your heart, don't give up, and, the worst of all, the mysterious stranger with the solutions to all of life's problems, who blows into town, teaches the kids to dance or the adults to be tolerant, and then disappears, leaving his words of wisdom behind among the forever-changed acolytes.

4392388,4,B004K4FUQQ,"Samir is a self-assured, accomplished, and extremely diligent sous chef. His hard work has earned him a position as second-in-command at a high profile eatery. And, having paid his dues the past six years, expects to be tapped to head his boss' latest expansion restaurant. He's so secure in that knowledge that, when it's announced through a trade publication that a junior chef that he oversees will be given the prestigious position, he is utterly dumbstruck.

Angry, confused and frothing - he demands an explanation. The top chef explains to him that he's competent, efficient, and very much an excellent lieutenant, but he just doesn't have what it takes to be a head chef. The boss hesitates giving him a full and honest critique until he's pushed into a corner and relents. He tells Samir that, in his opinion, he lacks the verve, the passion, and the simple love of cooking.

Stunned and emotionally devastated - Samir quits. Deciding he needs to make a big move, both physically and professionally, he puts out feelers to hire on as a Parisian 'stodge' (stge), essentially an unpaid intern; working for free to understudy with a French master in the belief that he will prove them all wrong.

At the very moment he makes that decision - his father, a restauranteur himself, suffers a heart attack.

It's not life-threatening, but it is life-changing. What Samir doesn't realize is that it's his life that will change the most.

Having had to postpone his plans until his dad can recover, he's now in charge of the family business. It's a rundown hole-in-the-wall serving Indian cuisine. Ironically, having spent his entire life avoiding and denying his own cultural heritage, it's a style he can't cook. In part, because he craves acceptance at the highest level of the culinary world - and that means mastering French. And, quietly, a stab into the hearts of his parents who he feels reveres his dead brother over himself. It's wrong, and the film clearly shows that his parents love him as he is; but that unspoken insecurity has driven a deep painful dagger into his soul.

'Today' is a wonderful journey of self-discovery. One which forces an honest look into the mirror and seriously questioning the person who stares back.

Slowly, Samir realizes that his former boss pegged him correctly after all. He's technically perfect but lacks, much to his dismay, a heart. He's filled his life with so much untouched emotional baggage that he's lost touch with his very soul; and that has crowded out the very thing he's so passionate about: Cooking.

Can a chance encounter with a mysterious and wondrous cab driver change his outlook?

And ultimately, what does he discover at the bottom of his own Masala bowl?

Not only a film about hubris, comeuppance, humility and spiritual recovery; but also tells the tale of a wayward son that returns ""home"" - both emotionally and culturally.

An enjoyable and funny, if boilerplate, movie.

Personal Notes:

- All the players did an outstanding job in the film, but I was struck by Naseeruddin Shah, who played Akbar the taxi driver. His performance - which blended sublime, humorous and deeply touching - was the 'wow' factor for me. A top shelf actor. I truly hope to see more of the man's work as he's found a new fan.

- And finally I would be remiss not to mention Ajay Naidu who played the completely disgusting arrogant spittle-filled line cook. Holy smokes, that guy is freakin' hilarious! Had me laughing every moment he was on screen. If there were a Best Performance Which Makes You Want To Never Go Into A Eatery Award - this character would be the hands down winner.",1328832000,2,3632,4.808988764044944

I love Naseruddin Shah, he is always amazing and also Madhur Jaffrey, ( who knew Madhur was such a terrific actress) I have all her cookbooks. This movie was a delight, great acting and also a beautiful, funny and emotional story...  and can i just say that Aasif Mandvi is not only hot, but a terrific actor. he carried this movie effortlessly. I hope to see him as the lead in many many more films.",1300924800,2,470,4.222222222222222
