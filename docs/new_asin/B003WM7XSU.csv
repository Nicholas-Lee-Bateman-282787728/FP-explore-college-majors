4214206,5,B003WM7XSU,"If you like Porcupine Tree or have any appreciation for Steven Wilson, I highly recommend this DVD.  I have always wondered what went on in Wilson's mind and this documentary shows so many aspects of his thought and creative processes.

A must have for PT lovers.",1308096000,,263,4.695652173913044
4214207,2,B003WM7XSU,"I have to say this is quite sub par compared to SW's other DVD's. I'm a huge Porcupine Tree fan and I loved his solo album (which this is a documentary of). I must say though this whole DVD was quite boring. We see Mr. Wilson breaking iPod's in 10 different ways, and walking around a creepy doll area. That's great and all but what exactly is the point?

A lot of the reviews on here gave the impression I would be delving into the mind behind the music. Really it's just a guy going to his old school and not even mentioning his creative process. This would have been awesome to see him mixing the music and showing where the inspiration for each song came from. Unfortunately we just hear his annoying old man opinions about iPods and a few select stories of him growing up not liking sports.

Most of the movie is just some decent visuals put to music, which wasn't bad but not what I was expecting. I was hoping this would be a documentary about Steven Wilson and what inspires him/how he makes music. Instead all we got was about an hour of interesting visuals and 20 minutes of Wilson being a crabby old man.

Buy the Anesthetize DVD instead, consider this only if you're a hardcore SW fan (of which I would say I am one and I still don't think it's worth it).",1301529600,6,1267,4.270833333333333
4214208,1,B003WM7XSU,"It's just a documentary about Steven life, and his particular way to see the evlution of music formats (Vinyl,CDs and MP3). I`m not agree whith his position, because MP3 and internet are the newest form to show and hear music, and I think to refused new things, thinkin past things were better, is a wrong concept.

There`s no music here. There`s just a live presentation of experimental music (music?) in noise form that don't like me. There`s no music without melody.",1299369600,,469,4.790123456790123
4214209,5,B003WM7XSU,"The DVD companion to this amazing album is a thoughtful discussion of music, the industry, SW's obsession with destroying iPods (and why) intermixed with scenes from the brilliant video to Harmony Korine and the artwork on various Steven Wilson projects. Couples with Lasse Hoile's beautiful cinematography and I just sat and absorbed it all. A true artist and musician. A great experience and highly recommended.",1298419200,3,413,5.369230769230769
4214210,3,B003WM7XSU,"I've had a deep respect and appreciation for Steven's projects since I first discovered his talent with the release of Porcupine Tree's InAbsentia. Since then, I can say I have never been so impacted by a single musical artist as I am with SW. With that said, watching this for the third time last night (and with my wife in order to get an outside perspective) my thoughts have become clearer now on my opinion of this pseudo documentary.

Pros: historical insight about Steven Wilson with candid appearances from a few  other artists like Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth, beautiful packaging and cinematography by Lasse Hoile/Carl Glover, unreleased songs that are par for release on an official studio album, overall great release with plenty of quality extras.

Cons: as beautifully done as the surrealism was it certainly becomes overkill with the use of effects and footage-to me these visuals work best in small doses for such a long film but are brilliant for use in music videos (see Harmony Korine), therefore the darkness from that surreal footage overshadows the film and makes it loose its appeal to outsiders or even for me to want to view it again, would like to have seen more actual footage of Steven working in the studio, be aware that there are extreme ends of the spectrum with anything-Steven seems to come off as one sided on some issues however these points he communicates I believe truly come from a concern and passion for the fact that we as human beings are losing something special not only with the art of quality/soulful driven music but other things as well.

In the end Steven has some strong points and an untouchable talent for making/producing music. He has a keen and appealing sense of beauty when it comes to imagery. For me however this film is just too dark in nature to enjoy at its fullest.",1290384000,9,1828,4.738993710691824
4214211,4,B003WM7XSU,"I don't normally write reviews on media simply because art is subjective and the things that I listen for or look for are different than what other people might look for.  I'm making an exception in this case as this release does a few things functionally as well as artistically.

-- the semi-objective portion of the review --
The feature film is really Steven Wilson in a nutshell. It delves into Wilson's childhood and artistic development, with an explanation of what aspects of his upbringing are meaningful and how those things are translated in his music.  He is represented in various projects, from solo work to Bass Communion to Blackfield to Porcupine Tree, to his close ties to other projects like Opeth.  More than anything, however, the film is an explanation (and at times a justification) of Wilson's approach to music and his distaste and frustration with what music is today.

Hoile did a great job capturing all of these elements and putting them together in a cohesive and captivating way.  As a documentary, the film was creative and conveys points and opinions without getting too artsy.  Whether or not you like or dislike the film will have more to do with whether or not you like Wilson's music, opinions, and personality.

-- the not-so objective portion of the review --
I knew a lot about Steven Wilson going into this.  I have a hard time appreciating modern music at face value.  I start breaking it down and thinking about what went into the writing and recording of it.  In most cases, I have to respect the artist before I can respect his/her work.  So, 3 years ago, I discovered Porcupine Tree and for 3 years I've listened to them along with Insurgentes and some work by Blackfield almost daily.  I've seen several clips of Wilson discussing his approach or his opinions on music.  Add those to what he expresses in every album that he touches, and I have a pretty good idea of what he wants to accomplish.  I enjoyed the documentary even though there wasn't anything too surprising for me.",1289606400,27,2026,4.715909090909091
4214212,5,B003WM7XSU,"I really didn't know what to think about this when I first got it.  It was a surprise (not sure how) from a great friend that owns an independent record store in my neighborhood.  He knew I was a giant fan of Steven Wilsons and pretty much devoured everything he put out. I tried to figure out what this was by the description, don't try - which only piqued my curiousity. To put it mildly, I floored.  This is a must for any fan of Wilsons, Porcupine Tree, or music in general.  It is oddly inspirational, so I definately recommend it to any musician that has trouble fitting-in in todays cookie cutter world.  I really feel like, now I finally know the man who is Steven Wilson, and that alone is worth a million dollars.  Maybe that's it, the inspirational part, I had elivated him to a godlike status and he turns out to be just like me or you.  Funny how a film full of coffins and bleak landscapes can bring so much sunshine into ones life.  GET IT! (By the way - Steven, I love you man!)",1289174400,9,994,4.222222222222222
4214213,3,B003WM7XSU,"Not really surprising but a very odd 76 minute film on the first disc. The film, directed by Lasse Hoile [who's done just about every video, concert film and photography from Porcupine Tree and Wilson this past decade], jumps all over their place. Some portions show bleak scenes [which is typical of Hoile's work] - sort of wastelands.

He goes back to his old high school, a grave in Mexico, chatting with other musicians, to Israel, to Japan, and to other locations. In between them you have Wilson talking about his three things he hates in current music: lack of quality in music and/or album artwork, his really hatefulness to iPods and MP3 players [you'll see him shooting, smashing, driving over and burning them] and how he hates the music used by them [but he still sells MP3s on his band's website]. He also talks about how fans complain when albums are too short - they expect 70+ minutes to an album and objects to negative reviews.

This was described as a ""making of"" documentary but it really isn't.

The second disc has 6 unreleased tracks from the Insurgentes sessions, excerpts from Bass Communion/Pig [another Wilson side project] live in Mexico [unsure why included except it was recording during the same period], Q&A session after the Denmark film festival premiere and an alternative ending [a bit strange for a documentary].",1288483200,16,1349,4.856521739130435
8407415,4,B003WM7XSU,"I so agree with Steven about the loss of the LP as a singular work of art combining music with visual images (cover sleeve). In my youth, purchasing an LP like King Crimson's ""Lizard"" was an event, with the printed lyrics and the cover art so perfectly enhancing the musical experience - not to mention it was a perfect cover to roll joints on.

I also agree with him about how free downloads and devices like the iPod have reduced the sound quality, the value and appreciation of music, and how it is incorporated into one's life. IMO music today functions as background noise for other forms of equally shallow virtual activities. When artificially processed and marketed, it is largely robbed of its personality and importance in one's life. At least that's my observation as an aged baby boomer who refuses to advance into the digital age. But you know what? I'm getting along fine without it.",1497571200,,897,4.713375796178344

8407417,2,B003WM7XSU,"Steve Wilson is a brilliant composer and song writer. I'm a huge fan of Wilson and Porcupine Tree....However this ""work"" is flawed in so many ways and was such a disappointment. I felt completely ripped-off. Wilson should stay out of the film/ cinematography field. Lasse Hoile's face is digitally masked/ blurred out in the Q & A section of disc #2 ... either his ego is so large that he feels necessary to protect his identity or he's completely embarrassed by this extremely boring lack-luster self -indulgent piece of crap. Wilson talks about being selfish in creating... yes, I completely understand that. But bad is bad.... boring is boring. No amount of selfishness can rescue this production. He's no John Cage or Philip ""Koyaanisqasti"" Glass for that matter. Have a good concept and get a good director...  NIN found director Mark Romanek or Floria Sigismondi for Marilyn Manson both are stellar creatives.  Nice overall presentation but the content is just not there.

I lost count on how many iPods were smashed and destroyed. Slow motion no less! I get it Steve - your hatred of the digital apparition of MP3's.  After the first two were destroyed... it got old very quickly.  Move on...already!  The content whatever there was/is has no meaning, importance or organization conceptually. This looks like it was thrown together in an afternoon from past vacation vids.

The only bright spot in this feeble excuse for an ""art"" film are the additional unreleased audio tracks on disc #2.  Save your money and buy one of the live concert DVD's or Blu-rays. They are all stunning and mixed to Wilson's approval & perfection. Lasse's efforts on the concert filming are decent and acceptable as well.

You have been warned... buy at your own risk.",1469750400,,1752,4.911864406779661
8407418,5,B003WM7XSU,"Lots of interviews and thoughts from Steven Wilson about music, his music, the music industry and musical devices from records to portable digital. Really great documentary for the Steven Wilson/Porcupine Tree fan. Had no idea Steven Wilson LOVES iPods so much. :)",1445212800,,264,5.309523809523809

8407420,3,B003WM7XSU,"if you are not well awake, this video will put you to sleep. I thought this video was going to go deeper into Wilson's personal,creative and artistic talents",1412640000,,157,4.642857142857143
8407421,2,B003WM7XSU,"Like many others, I have followed Steve and Porcupine Tree for many years, but this film is some-what disturing and could cause nightmares. The footage from Mexico with the dismembered dolls heads is just too creepy, and I don't get the terrifying look on Steve's face when he is at Disneyworld in Florida, is he part of the hate-America first crowd? I am sure that most of the money that he has in his bank account came from hard-working Americans like myself who like (most of) his music and don't appreciate his seeming disdain for the U.S.A. Then again, with his admitted fetish of photographing dead children and his ""poor little me"" aura when it comes to dealing with women in his life, I've often thought that the guy needs to see a shrink. I can also see that without his father's help in building him electronic gadgets when he was younger, we may not know Steve's music at all...now, wouldn't that be a shame.",1367020800,,919,4.575757575757576
8407422,5,B003WM7XSU,"This movie is more like a biographical view of SW. But, is really well made and the colors are really beautiful.",1357516800,,112,4.380952380952381
8407423,4,B003WM7XSU,"Being a longtime fan of Steven Wilson, this review is going to be rather biased.  I mean, the guy makes Thom Yorke of Radiohead (whom he openly admires) look like an amateur.  I've been a fan of Porcupine Tree since the brilliant DEADWING album, which then prompted me to go pickup, in rather rapid succession, every other album I could get my hands on, including INSURGENTES (the album) and the new GRACE FOR DROWNING two-disc set.  Even his work with Blackfield is inspiring.

When I found out that his longtime collaborator Lasse Hoile had made a feature length film about SW, I had to get my hands on it.  Not quite a making-of documentary for the eponymous album, and not quite a story of the life of one of music's great writers, INSURGENTES is perhaps a little of everything, following SW on his worldly journey through his first solo album, while at the same time providing commentary on music and social phenomenon, once in a while showing his interaction with his contempararies, including Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth and Israeli rock star Aviv Geffen.

One of the most visible aspects of INSURGENTES, which actually preceded the DVD release because bits of it ended up on YouTube, are the scenes that show Wilson destroying iPods using various tools, fire, and a shotgun, to name a few.  While visually funny, particularly coming from someone who might be viewed as a person who might take himself a little too seriously, the interspliced commentary about the .mp3 players themselves provides the more serious side of his opinions, that music has been reduced from an extravagantly packaged and produced physical and auditory experience to compressed formats.  This, coupled with his sounds-like-bile venting about how bands don't care about the album artwork and packaging, makes for an entertaining viewing experience.

Further interspliced amonst all of the clips filmed include bits about Wilson's upbringing outside London and school days, recalling his dissatisfaction and ineptitude with sports.  It's interesting to see him with his parents in the family home, watching a sound test video he did when he was a teenager and wonder ""What is this?"", but at the same time sharing some good feelings about his father, who built some of the first recording equipment he'd ever used in his career.

Mainly, however, Wilson's darker, more opinionated side is shown, whether it's driving over an iPod docking station with a car or complaining about PT fans wondering why FEAR OF A BLANK PLANET was ""only 50 minutes long"" and how they thought they deserved more music for their dollar.  But for all of his outspokenness on downloaded content and how obtuse some of it actually may be, his and Hoile's greatest moment comes as they film someone downloading .mp3 versions of Beatles albums.  While I don't personally believe that iPods are outright atrocious, per se, Wilson's argument is hard to ignore.

While beautifully shot and visually stunning, at some point the sudden jumps and cuts between scenes and the soundtrack dynamics become a bit nauseating.  ARRIVING SOMEWHERE... this is not.  For a few seconds, Wilson is showing cutting tracks for the solo album, then suddenly they cut to a field in which several people in costumes and gas masks are crawling down a country road on their hands and knees.  Surrealistic, perhaps, but as the movie goes on, it becomes headache inducing.  Such is the style of Hoile.  The PT DVD's he filmed are brilliant and feature similar editing, but here it's a bit too much.

INSURGENTES is a great documentary film, especially for those who pursue music, either as a hobby or professionally.  And totally indispensable for the SW fan, young and old.",1318896000,,3698,4.970779220779221
8407424,4,B003WM7XSU,"Ok, so I keep seeing documentary being used to describe this movie. It is clearly not a documentary. This is a road movie of an artist as he travels thru the process of creating his latest ""work'. Yes, the journey takes him back to his childhood home and his school, but all of this influenced where he is at in his life at this time. He discusses his opinions on many things, and some of them are agreeable to most and some are not, but still this is what he is thinking and feeling as he writes his album. All of this is accompanied by surreal imagery and creepy settings which inspire him in his creative process. In the end, the album is complete, but the journey to discover continues-get it? If you are a fan of Steven Wilson, I think you will.

If you are looking for a behind the scenes look at the technical making of an album, this is not it. If you are looking for a concert film, this is not it. If you are looking to find out what makes an artist tick-this is it!

Side note: This is expertly crafted and a treat to watch. Disc 2 has a multitude to offer to those that are fans of S. Wilson's music with rare tracks and even rarer performance art of Bass Communion and Pig. The film was caringly crafted as was the artwork/menus/cases. Mine came in a gorgeous digibook with the discs housed in the covers. Indeed, worth every penny.",1318377600,2,1345,4.25
