8356995,5,B0028S111Y,"Mi son likes it so much. My wife and I grew up watching Chavo del Ocho in the original format back in the 80's-90's.
My son asked to have his 5th birthday party with ""Chavo del Ocho"" stuff. So we already did some shopping and this was my pre-gift for him.
He sits for at least 2 hours to watch the episodes.

Buy it, thank me later. Vale la pena comprar los DVD!!",1395360000,3,363,3.9726027397260273
