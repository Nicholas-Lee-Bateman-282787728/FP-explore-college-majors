5124597,5,B0083C04FI,"Have you ever been to a club and seen a guy that looked too old for the crowd? Maybe he's there with younger friends, or maybe his younger office mates dragged him out, but whatever the reason, he's out of place. I was that guy. There's one of these guys in every club, on any given night. But every once in a while, one of these older guys surprises you. He gets out there and as soon as he starts dancing, he fits right in. He knows all the moves, he's confident, and he gets respect from the other guys in the club. This DVD is a MUST for anybody like me who works with younger people and gets invited out to a nightclub. Armed with moves and confidence from this DVD, the next time I went out to the club, I had a great time, fit right in, and I noticed people looking at me a little differently the next morning in the office.",1341100800,2,831,4.042424242424242
5124598,5,B0083C04FI,"Own the Dance Floor is a great product for those that either lack the moves out on the dance floor or lack the confidence to know what they are doing. Just one run-through of this video will have people who once looked at you like, ""Get this person off the Dance Floor"" to ""Wow, how can I get his number?"" Great Video!",1341014400,2,318,4.145161290322581
5124599,4,B0083C04FI,"I honestly was very skeptical to try a video lesson on how to dance, but my friend suggested Dancefloor and I gave it a try. Surprisingly the video successfully methodologically taught me many moves and good tips on how to flow better. I would definitely suggest this video for people who have in the past tried to take lessons and found them useless.",1340928000,3,351,4.587301587301587

5124601,1,B0083C04FI,"Can I give it zero stars, what a joke?  Some guy and some moves for the ""ladies"", haha...don't waste your money...you'd be better off youtubing standard moves",1404518400,,158,4.851851851851852
5124602,1,B0083C04FI,"Own the dance floor  More like clown the dance floor.  Common moves for the simple man More like pathetic moves from a common man.

I say pathetic movements because these are hardly even moves at all, but more so movements, such as: bounce along like us to the beat now on this move lift your heel off the ground  Yeah, no joke for 4 of the 7 moves taught you actually keep your feet totally planted and on another one you only slightly lift your heels!  Which means you only even move your feet on 2 of the 7 moves covered.

Finally, this video is about 65 minuets in total and be aware the the final 8 minutes is this same guy trying to sell you on his other 2 DVDs, which I also had the unfortunate luck to have purchased (I bought all three at the same timeWHOOPS!).  This guy should do infomercials for a living, because he is a decent salesman, but a horrible instructor and not even a good dancer.  You would be better off going to YouTube to pick up some moves then purchasing this garbage.",1399507200,7,998,4.21578947368421
5124603,5,B0083C04FI,"I own a lot of dance dvds but this is one of my favorites. Just as Brian says the moves are very easy to learn, look great and you can use them to any kind of music. They are great starter moves to really get anyone dancing. I first watched this probably over a year ago and since I have learned many new dance styles and moves but I almost always start with one of these moves. It doesn't matter how advanced you get it is always good to start basic. Great dvd!!",1398470400,,463,3.989247311827957

5124605,5,B0083C04FI,"These how to dance videos do not teach choreography.  They teach you have to not look like an idiot out dancing at a club, bar, or even around your house.  The music is good, though it is not popular songs you hear on the radio, but it has a good beat and does make you feel like dancing.  The back up dancers show other variations that can be done with the simple steps.  The dances look hard, but they break it down step by step.  The DVDs are supposed to be set in a club, which is hard to determine where they are at, but I don't think it really matters.  The quality is good for what they are offering you.  The DVDs are not for good dancers, but for average Joe's that want to not look stupid.  If you are already a pretty decent dancer, than these are not for you, but for the rest of us these are good.  A female can also do these moves, but probably should add a little more sexiness to their hips and arm movements.  Good DVDs!!",1391040000,3,938,4.048913043478261
5124606,5,B0083C04FI,"This DVD is great because it teaches you different moves you can string together however you want on the dance floor. They teach you different ways you can mix in your own style into it and common mistakes people make. All these things put together make the learning experience much, much easier. And after practicing a bit, I was a lot more confident in my moves. Definitely worth it if you need a little guidance on developing your moves for the club.",1390435200,,453,4.536585365853658
5124607,3,B0083C04FI,"WAS  EXPECTING TO LEARN A FEW GIRLY MOVES, BUT THIS DVR WAS STRICTLY FOR YOUNG MEN.  HAD TO RETURN IT AS IT WASN'T FOR A WOMAN MY AGE.  WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.  SORRY",1383177600,3,165,4.0625
5124608,1,B0083C04FI,"This is an archaic video that should not be sold by Amazon.

Its out of date.

There are two DVDs, both are going into the disk shredder today.

What a waste of money.",1378857600,3,167,4.0
5124609,4,B0083C04FI,"Firstly, I'd like to say that the video production of this DVD is really top-notch, and I've found the moves easy to follow because of the way they're broken down. I think that Brian Henninger is a great dance teacher.

About the purchase: I purchased this video in August 2013 from the Nightlife Media Group web site ([...] rather than from Amazon. I also selected the video digital downloads rather than wait for DVD's to be shipped to me. I wanted to write this review to warn customers about potential problems when buying the digital downloads.

The site offers videos in zip file format, and only allows each video to be downloaded 3 times, after which the video link expires. Unfortunately, their web site appears to have a problem and most of their video downloads do not work for me (I don't know about other customers). I tried several times, and of course reached the maximum 3 download limits. I now cannot download the videos any more. I emailed their support team, but the reply was to check my internet connection or to upgrade to physical DVD's.

After just over a week, Nightlife Media Group did reply that their web site indeed had a problem, and renewed my download links. They also asked whether I'd prefer to have DVD's shipped to me free of charge. Not only that, but as a token of goodwill for their web site issue, they also added 2 extra links for the videos ""Hip Hop Grooves"" and ""Hip Hop Moves Past & Present""! Awesome!

Unfortunately, I still experienced similar problems, but was able to overcome them by repairing the 99% downloaded zip files with software such as Zip Repair Pro. I was then able to extract the video files once the zip files were repaired.

Overall, I'd recommend buying the DVD's instead of the digital downloads. I have to say that Nightlife Media Group have been great in rectifying the issue by renewing my download links and offering 2 Hip Hop instruction videos free of charge .",1378684800,,1932,4.637426900584796
5124610,5,B0083C04FI,"Own The Dance Floor was perfect for what I needed - simple moves for a common man.

I've never been a good dancer but I used to be able to ""get by"" but over the years I'd lost my confidence and I used to be the awkward guy who would sit on the edge on the dancefloor with a beer feeling awkward.

I actually STOPPED going out to clubs and bars and would feel incredibly uncomfortable when anyone even mentioned dancing.  This really started to affect my relationship as we all know girls like to dance and I knew if I didn't step my game up I'd be single pretty soon and being single not able to dance is a bad place to be!

I knew I had to conquer this and I started looking for a solution that wasn't some old dude showing you cheesy moves.

Own The Dance Floor was that product and I can tell you that after only 2 hours I had learned 5 moves that I could execute perfectly and I went to an outdoor even DURING THE DAY and danced all day!

I used to struggle to do a 2 step in the dark in the corner of a packed club yet here I was pulling all kinds of moves in broad day light and lapping up the attention.

Brian's course changed my life and as I've now bought 5 other DVD programs I am excited at what the future holds and I'm loving going to the clubs again.

If I can do this so can you - Get your copy now and start getting your life back!",1375315200,,1348,3.894160583941606
5124611,5,B0083C04FI,I took the plunger and bought all the videos from this source.  it has been a great purchase.  I discovered that the teaching was easy to follow; the dance moves are explained very well; and I have already started using some of the moves in my dancing on a regular basis.  thank you to brian henninger!,1371600000,,302,4.357142857142857
5124612,5,B0083C04FI,"These videos really helped me give me the moves and confidence I need to just let myself go and dance at the nightclubs. I used to be very hesitant to dance out on the floor unless there were alot of people on the dancefloor already and I wouldnt draw too much attention to myself because I was so self-conscious of how I looked when I was dancing, but ever since practicing and perfecting the simple but stylish moves Brian teaches in this video series, I have had alot more fun at the club and met alot more girls too. Highly recommend for anyone who has 2 'left feet' and needs moves to use at the club to dazzle and impress.",1367712000,2,628,4.241666666666666
5124613,5,B0083C04FI,"For years my wife has been urging me to get up and dance, but I almost always declined because of my awkwardness in dancing. After previewing this series of dance instructional DVDs I took the plunge and purchased a set. WOW! I feel younger again and wished I had these dance lesson years ago as I haven't looked back after trying out only a limited number of moves. Thank you to the dance instructors for the fun and easy to learn lessons.",1367712000,,440,4.378048780487805
5124614,4,B0083C04FI,"I am athletic, but have trouble keeping all my parts in sync. The video instruction lets you know what to do and how to check to make sure you are doing it
correctly. Its well worth the small investment. I am looking forward to the next wedding, party, etc.",1360886400,,257,4.26530612244898
5124615,5,B0083C04FI,"This is a great DVD for those who want to feel respected on the dance floor,but this DVD doesn't have dance moves for when it comes to dancing with a partner.",1359849600,2,158,4.129032258064516
5124616,3,B0083C04FI,"The other reviews are accurate but what they don't mention is how throughout the dance lesson and at the end of the lesson, they're plugging the company's website and other products. Several times during the lesson you're encouraged to visit the website where you can get small free videos, like how to relax the neck and back to make your dancing better.  Unfortunately these supplements are password protected and seem to only be available to people who purchase the entire set of DVDs from the website.  There is also a link mentioned in the DVD's insert that offers more dance moves for free.  That link doesn't exist, and signing up for the newsletter on the website doesn't get you the password either.

  All in all, it's still a good dancing DVD like the other reviews say, but just be aware when you purchase it that the free stuff they mention throughout the DVD and on the insert isn't available, at least not without buying the company's complete line of products.",1357430400,29,976,4.711764705882353
5124617,5,B0083C04FI,"I've never been a dancer because of my fear of looking like a nerd. After watching this DVD and seeing some of the instructional steps, I'm hoping to at the least be able to get on the dance floor with some basic decent moves.",1356566400,,226,4.159090909090909
5124618,4,B0083C04FI,"As a girl, I've always been a ""dance by myself"" kind of dancer. I own pretty much all the other DVDs by this company, so I decided to get this one, too. I have a few weddings coming up and I really wanted to make sure I had a handle on dancing with my partner, so we could present a united front. I was actually surprised to learn some new moves in this, and they way they break down basic grinding and dancing with a partner really helped me understand what I was missing before.

This dvd is perfect for a guy who feels totally uncomfortable on the dance floor, and wants to learn enough moves to get put into the ""good dancer"" category and be able to easily and naturally initiate dancing with a partner. It's aimed mostly for men, but teaches the moves to girls too. However, if you're a girl just learning to dance, I recommend starting with ""Sexy Moves for the Club"" and ""Girls Night Out"" first by the same company. Those videos will teach girls basic grinding, too, as well as tons of moves girls can do without a partner.

In this DVD, they break everything down so it's easy to understand, but you definitely aren't going to learn how to do a hip hop video. They focus on the sort of simple moves that one can use over and over.

I also like that they explain some of the social tactics about dancing and approaching a partner. They offer hints about how you can tell when someone is interested. They also teach you how to ""turn up the heat"" and initiate closer dancing and grinding.

I definitely give this DVD at least 4 stars for accomplishing what it sets out to do.

Why not 5 stars?

1.) At times, the girl partner Nicole looked a little miserable, which seemed out of character considering her bubbly, smiling and excited demeanor in ""Sexy Moves for the Club"" and ""Girls Night Out."" She still did a fantastic job at demonstrating the moves, I just wanted to punch whoever put that frown on her face. :)

2.) This DVD seemed shorter and had fewer moves than the other DVDs by this company. I never got to a point where I felt like I really needed to go back and watch any of the moves again, since there were so few moves and they were so simple. I watched it all the way through once or twice, and then I stopped feeling like I was getting anything out of it. With the other DVDs by this company, there was a whole lot more replay value for me, because I couldn't get all the moves in just one watch-through. However, if you're a guy and want to learn how to dance with a partner in time for tonight, then this is definitely for you. You'll be able to master everything in just an hour or two of practice.",1355961600,6,2621,4.251004016064257
5124619,5,B0083C04FI,Equally valid in its method though. Couldn't help smiling at this young  man's approach. I am 78 years old and not sure I wil survive the learning process GRins but if I have to die trying so be it.,1355961600,8,198,4.076923076923077
5124620,5,B0083C04FI,"I'm not at all a dancer, but this DVD is fun and easy to follow. It taught me great dance moves that I now use when I'm out in clubs. For someone who was not very outgoing when they went out, this DVD has really helped boost my confidence on the dance floor. I recommend it.",1355529600,6,274,3.9107142857142856
5124621,4,B0083C04FI,"I can't really say that I have 2 left feet, but at the same time doing the white man shuffle (hands at your side and two stepping it,) only works at family weddings. I was never a big dancer to begin with and big part of it was, that I felt stupid doing the same move to every song. After watching the DVD I learned some basic steps. Although still not a big dancer, its definitely given me more confidence while out. Plus when a girl says, ""wow you are pretty good,"" it is always a good thing to hear.
Video definitely teaches you at the right pace and doesn't give you any extreme moves that you will have a hard time remembering. Definitely worth buying!",1354320000,3,657,4.222222222222222
5124622,5,B0083C04FI,"First, let me say that this isn't for experienced dancers (though you can probably still learn a move or two), but for the guy who works a full-time job and is trying to get his groove on on the weekends.

That being said, if you are the guy who stands in the back of the club, clutching a drink and looking like a creep, this DVD is perfect for you. I used to be that guy because I had no idea how to dance. I decided to pick up this DVD cause what the heck why not? It turned out to be a good move because now I at least know the basics and can hold my own when a girl grabs my hand to dance. I highly recommend this for any newbie or casual club-goer.",1354320000,10,654,3.8088235294117645
5124623,5,B0083C04FI,"I really enjoyed practising along to this dvd, all the routines were broken up and easy to follow.
Some of them are quite basic but they are perfect for just getting started and have really improved my confidence. Simple moves aren't a bad thing either and sometimes are a lot more effective than a rehearsed routine or a complicated move.
So now I am no longer self-conscious about looking like a drunk clown when being dragged out to clubs.
Looking forward to trying out the next DVD in the series.",1344902400,17,500,4.566666666666666
5124624,5,B0083C04FI,"This DVD was great.  It teaches you basic, easy to follow, moves and how to put them altogether into a dance.  There are many dances on the DVD and with a little practice your dancing good in no time.",1344729600,3,200,4.102564102564102
5124625,5,B0083C04FI,"My situation is the same as Never Too Old, often being dragged to clubs. And I'll just sit down the whole session..
Was a 1 month wait to get my DVDs in the mail & I can't wait to finish all 4 DVDs. Explains step by step what to do, when to do it.
Looking forward to be the star the next time I go clubbing!
Thank you so much!

5124626,5,B0083C04FI,"This dvd has a lot of moves that are very simple to learn, but would actually look good on the dance floor. Nothing cheesy here. The instructors are super cool. They seem like down to earth guys who really want to share their passion and help guys gain more confidence and have more fun. I've spent quite a bit of time in clubs and other venues where people are dancing and the moves they teach will definitely help me fit in and feel more confident and have more fun. This a great product and I recommend it to others who want help with their dancing skills.",1344643200,,559,4.283018867924528
5124627,5,B0083C04FI,"Let me preface the review by stating that I am a total beginner when it comes to dancing.

This video was perfect for me. The content in the video is easy to follow, and very in depth for someone like me who is just getting started.

I also like how they break down the moves so that you can really be prepared. I was worried whether or not the moves would be too canned to use. However, I did end up using the moves at a (dark, haha) club, and the girl I was with thought that I knew what I was doing, which mean mission success!

I would highly recommend this video for beginners!",1344556800,6,582,4.043478260869565
5124628,4,B0083C04FI,"I really like this DVD.  I've never seen anything like this, and I'm so glad I found it.  Really detailed, short lessons break up learning to dance toindividual moves.  Each lesson teaches you a different move, and the end of the DVD shows you how you can combine the moves to a song.  The music was spot on, exactly what they're playing in clubs today.  I didn't recognize any of the music, they probably didn't have the rights for top 40 hits, but the tracks were all good, and even though some songs had lyrics, it was never distracting.  For what it's worth, I really like the main instructor.  He was friendly, and seemed like he really enjoys what he does.  I have definitely improved my dancing skills after watching these lessons, but the moves are definitely for beginners.  I can see myself using all of these moves in the club, but I wish the DVD had more moves.  I know there's a volume 2, and I'm sure they want to sell more DVDs by leaving out content that's in the second volume, but I wish I didn't have to buy another DVD, although I probably will after watching this one.",1343692800,3,1089,4.373134328358209
