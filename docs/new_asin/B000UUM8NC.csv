showing you how to obtain smooth skin textures. Her technique is very meticulous and precise. It is one dvd I will watch many time over.",1208995200,9,224,4.232558139534884
2925205,5,B000UUM8NC,"As a competent botanical artist I am delighted to have this DVD to extend my watercolour abilities into portrait painting. It is an excellent, step-by-step guide through materials, paints etc, wet into wet and transclucenet depiction of skin tones. I'm finding it extremely valuable.",1207958400,19,283,5.454545454545454
2925206,5,B000UUM8NC,"This is the 2nd DVD by Susan Harrison-Tustain that I have purchased this year, and I can highly recommend both of them!
They were jam-packed with everything I needed to know.
On this portrait DVD I found the printable drawings and reference images especially helpful. I worked along with the DVD step by step.
I have only taken up watercolour painting later in life and I am very excited by my progress so far, thanks mostly to Susan's wonderful teaching style and techniques.
I hope one day to attend one of her watercolour workshops.
I highly recommend this DVD to anyone at any stage of their artistic journey.

2925207,5,B000UUM8NC,"This is one of the most beautiful and easy to follow instructional video's on watercolor portraits.  Susan is a extremely talented watercolor artist.  She uses layers and layers of color to build a very realistic portrait.  I can't wait to watch it over and over.  There is so much to learn from this DVD.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn more about the manipulation of watercolor as well as painting portraits.  She even explains what kind of brushes, watercolor paper and paint to use.  This is an excellent instructional workshop on DVD. After watching this DVD, I will definitely purchase her other DVD workshops.",1188000000,26,641,4.825688073394495
2925208,5,B000UUM8NC,I love Susan's work and the DVD is exceptional at providing watercolor techniques.,1404950400,,82,5.384615384615385
2925209,5,B000UUM8NC,"In my quest to become a highly skilled artist, I have searched and searched for high quality DVDs aimed at teaching Watercolor Realism. While there are many good ones on the market, this DVD is absolutely incredible for learning how to effectively paint portratis! This 3-hour DVD takes you from beginning to end on the painting shown on the cover. However, even if you don't want to duplicate this exact painting, the DVD is expertly designed to teach you how to create a beautiful rendering of several typical portrait surfaces - from glowing, luminous skin, realistic eyes, fabric etc to expertly placed shadows.  This is truly another winner by Susan Harrison-Tustain! It is perfect for all levels - beginners will learn great habits from day one, using techniques that will have their work look anything but beginner...and intermediate to advanced will certainly sharpen their skills by using the techniques of this internationally recognized artist.  Susan truly holds nothing back in this DVD.  She breaks down the complexity of painting a portrait in easy to follow, yet highly detailed instruction.

What impressed and helped me the most was Susan's masterful approach to skin. Instead of mixing the usual colors on the palette to arrive at a typical skin tone that looks flat as we so often see in watercolor, Susan shows us how to incorporate unexpected hues, applying them using her unique ""priming method"" to really give life to this difficult-to-master subject. For instance, the use of a touch of green or a shadow color in an unexpected hue. Just an exceptional DVD.

Susan has been teaching in excess of 25 years - over 25,000 DVD's sold worldwide, plus Susan teaches workshops in New Zealand, Australia, US and Europe,  She is also a best selling author.

Susan is also working on another video as I have come to understand called Watercolor Masterclass, the first installment of a series with new lessons such as ""crucial elements of a painting"", how to master leaves and vibrant greens - all challenging subjects! That will be another must have - I can't wait for its release! I am not surprised Susan has sold over 25,000 DVD's worldwide!",1404345600,5,2159,4.947513812154696
2925210,1,B000UUM8NC,"Throughout the entire video, the camera was so far away from the actual painting and at such an odd angle, that half the time I had no idea what she was doing. Complete waste of money.",1369267200,2,184,4.138888888888889
2925211,5,B000UUM8NC,"Exellent DVD. Step by step instruction.  Not too long, just right and doesn't miss a thing.  love it.  I would buy any DVD she puts out.",1357689600,4,136,4.153846153846154
2925212,5,B000UUM8NC,"Enjoyed the video and was able to follow along fairly well. Susan's double wash ""priming"" method creates lovely soft blends.",1349395200,2,124,5.25
2925213,5,B000UUM8NC,"Absolutely unbelievable, not only is the workmanship great but whoever made the videos knew exactly what to do to keep you completely captivated, and not wanting to shut off the dvd. I am still gathering materials, but fully intend to put her teachings to work.
Thanks for such a great job to everyone involved!!!",1300147200,,313,4.814814814814815

2925215,5,B000UUM8NC,"I have been working with this video now for the past couple of months as a reference for my own human subject, and I must say, I love the fact that Susan breaks this down into simple steps and that creating skin tone without using an opaque paint is so simple. Susan's instruction on creating shadow and skin tone that appear realistic is absolutely one of the greatest techniques I've seen. Susan thank you for sharing your talent through these helpful DVDs!",1273881600,4,459,4.609756097560975
2925216,5,B000UUM8NC,I just recieved my Dvd and watched it..it was so nice. Cant wait to get the water and paint out. Beginners to professionals would get alot out of these dvds. Robin,1267142400,,163,4.290322580645161
2925217,5,B000UUM8NC,"I purchased Glorious Garden Flowers at the urging of my grandmother to try out watercolor. Ms. Harrison-Tustain's introduction touched me and resonated with me. My style is not loose and abstract - and neither is hers. I enjoy the detail that makes a painting come to life. Ms. Harrison-Tustain's book explained how to create the important detail that makes my watercolors stand out from others. I followed up with her DVD's and have found that her method or instruction of watercolor painting is applicable to all types of subjects. This book will change your way of looking at watercolor washes - making your subjects glow - and it will help you understand the why watercolor works like it does!

I can honestly recommend buying two sets, you will wear out the first watching it over and over again!

Enoy the journey,
Heather",1248220800,6,828,4.823943661971831

8214855,5,B000UUM8NC,"This is an amazing DVD and all watercolorist no matter what stage could learn something from it.  She has a somewhat unusual technique in that she adds many layers of clear water and then very light layers of pigment, thereby slowing building up depth and luminosity.  The result almost looks like oil.  If you want a very realistic effect or even if you would rather have a finished product that looks more spontaneous and expressive, you will profit from her carefully explained process.  I've never seen skin look so vibrant!  Don't miss it.",1422576000,2,544,4.806451612903226
