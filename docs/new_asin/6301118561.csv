7811135,5,6301118561,"Macron 1 has been of my absolute favorites, ever since I was little. I'll never forget how I discovered this wonderful series. After watching a tape of the lame Ghostbusters cartoon (the one with the gorilla, NOT the one based on the movie) there were several trailers.  The one that stood out was for a show called Macron 1. It looked awesome, so naturally I rented a tape of the show, and loved it.

The story, as the intro tells you, takes place in 2525. A teleportation accident sends Major David Chance into an alternate universe terrorized by the forces of GRIP, led by Dark Star & Orn. When this happens, Dark Star & some of his army invade our world, leaving Orn in charge of the rest in the alternate universe. Two teams are born to battle them. On earth, Dr. Shegal and his group fight Dark Star while in the other universe Major David Chance helps the battle against Orn. Together, they are Macron 1.

This was made by combining footage from 2 different anime series into one. While I have to admit that it does show at times, for the most part it provided a very interesting setup. But this is a great dub anyways. The voices are some of the best I've ever heard in an English translation, and the music is the best I've ever heard composed for a dub. It's so good I don't mind the lack of sound effects during a battle because it allows me to hear the music more clearly. Combined with the great stories, this is just gold.

The story begins with a brilliant scientist, Dr. William Bridger being captured by agents of GRIP. Rather than let his secrets fall into enemy hands, he blows himself and his captors up. As a kid, it was rather shocking to see this on a cartoon. We then cut to his young boy, who has trouble accepting his father's death. He is assaulted by Skeletrons, skeleton robots that are the storm troopers of GRIP. He is rescued by Dr. Shegal, who introduces him to the rest of the Macron Team: Jason, Cathy & Scott, who pilot the greatest anime robot of them all, Macstar 1.  They take him to live on their ship Macron Base, which has the power to teleport.  This is an ability GRIP will stop at nothing to claim.  This is an excellent pilot that perfectly introduces the audience to the series. And let me take a break from the episode guide to tell you just how much I love the characters. Jason, Cathy & Scott are your typical Japanese super hero trio (The leader, the token woman & the sarcastic funny guy) but that doesn't make them any less interesting. Dark Star is a cool mysterious villain (I wondered about what he looked after seeing the first episode more than I ever wondered about what Dr. Claw looked like throughout all of Inspector Gadget. I actually wrote my idea for a grand finale in which the Macron team finds his secret base & starts blowing it up. He then steps out of the shadows, revealing himself to be a dragon man & tells Dr. Fritz to use a device to turn him into a giant and then takes on Macstar 1 in an epic finale battle. That's probably not how the actual series ended, but it's still a cool idea if you ask me!), and his generals (Prince Eharn, Captain Blade & Jeraldan) are just excellent villains. Whenever they argue it's hilarious. And even Nathan, the requisite (for reasons I'll never understand) kid character, while he does have annoying moments, is tolerable for the most part, often helping the team & even giving them the means to save the day in a couple episodes. Same thing goes for his cute robot companion, ND-2. I can't think of a giant robot anime with a better cast of characters. The only complaint I have is how underused Beta Command (Major Chance's team) is. But that's it.

Back to the episode guide. In episode 2, GRIP's top scientist Dr. Fritz introduces his creation, the robot Annihilator. They use an assault on a dam to lure the team to face it. This is another excellent episode, with a really cool robot of the week and some great chemistry between the characters.

After that, we see that Jason has really grown to like Nathan. So much, he lets him fly his ship. So naturally GRIP picks this time to attack, but our heroes manage to fend them off, even Nathan. Just another plain great episode.

Next, we see that Nathan's flying lessons are going well. But he hears the others seriously doubting him, so he tampers with the controls on Jason's ship, just before GRIP attacks (of course). This is my least favorite episode on the tape, but it's still good, thanks to a cool enemy robot & some excellent tension between Jason & Scott.

In the final episode of this volume, Nathan goes to an amusement park called (Fantasy land), which is really a trap by Dark Star. Scott comes to his rescue, and together they fight their way out. Yet another excellent and action-packed episode, and a great one to end the tape on.

Overall, this is an excellent series that continues to entertain me to this day. And since Disney owns the rights to this after buying out Saban, this is probably the only way you can see the episodes. WARNING: Before ordering, ask how long the tape is, because there are 2 versions; an hour long one which contains only the first 2 episodes and the 2 hour version which contains 5. Make sure you're getting the longer one.

So, in conclusion, if you ever see this tape, grab it & don't let go. Even if it's the one hour version, you'll still be getting at least a taste of this awesome show.",1358985600,,5408,4.434038267875126
7811136,5,6301118561,"I find that this great show is often forgotten.  When I discuss 80's cartoons with friends, I have to remind them of this show.  Invariably, the answer is along the lines of ""Oh, yeah!  I loved that show!  I forgot all about it!""  There were earlier anime series that were more popular that overshadowed this.

When I sat down to watch this, I was expecting an experience like I get with many other shows from my childhood: disappointment.  The reality was quite different.  I picked up new things this time.  Overtones and subtleties I didn't see as a child.  I found it just as engaging as the first time around, but for different reasons.  It's almost like watching it anew!  I recommend it for anybody who likes good stories and good animation.",1118966400,,748,4.583333333333333
