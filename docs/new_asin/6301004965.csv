This film is rightly remembered as a ""The Exorcist"" clone, but there are some bizarre visual touches and images that are worth checking out for those who are interested in the evolution of horror. This picture is a must see if only because it documents a very peculiar time in horror filmmaking  in the late 1960s and 70s when just about anything was put on film.",1170547200,2,506,4.382978723404255

Beyond that ,'Beyond the Door' achieves what gawdy hollywood flicks like 'The Excorcist' and 'Rosemarrys Baby' failed to. This movie is proof that independent film directors working with a shoe-string budget produce the best[by that I mean creepiest,scariest, and most disturbing] horror movies, NOT hollywood. What really grabbed me about this movie is the all-out weirdness and Creepy atmosphere which help to evoke a feeling of disturbness and dread. Some parts of this film where rather shocking and even gross. Best of all is the suprise ending which I will not give away....you've GOT to see this one!",1118448000,4,680,5.0265486725663715

But it is mandatory viewing for fans of horror, 70's filmmaking, and low budget afficianatos alike ... Juliette Mills' character is so creepy and disturbing, and the low-budget quality only adds to the impact .... While THE EXORCIST is far superior in a technical perspective, the obscurity and all-out weirdness of BEYOND THE DOOR make it more creepy ....

I remember both the commercial for when it was in theaters - I was little - and I remember the commercial for it on the late show on CBS.  Remember the late show?  I always fell asleep.  To me, the movie is a classic - yes, it is disjointed - the opening is so strange - seeing that guy's head on a naked woman's body has scarred me for life - and that little girl talking like that is hilarious - and what is with eating cans of pea soup - homage to Exorcist?  And, yes, it is cheesy in parts, a lot of them even.  But then somehow in the middle of all that, there are scenes that are like SOOO creepy out of nowhere.  Maybe they are so effective because they ARE in the middle of nonsense - Last House on the Left had that strategy - And I like the music and sound effects - they stick with you.  THE CHILD MUST BE BORN! - Just had to say that.  Yes - it is an Exorcist rip-off - and ironically, somehow very original.  I've watched it many times.  When the dolls come to life, I love that scene - filmed well.  And when she's laying on the bed and her head turns around and she has those teeth - I STILL want to run out of the room, and I don't scare easily.

I believe this was the director's first film, so, taking that into consideration, I think the guy did a bang up job.  I especially like the opening sequence with the sea of candles, and I really enjoyed the music soundtrack.  This is a two disc set.  The first disc features the UK release of the film under the title, ""The Devil Within Her"", and is a crystal clear print of the film.  The second disc is the U.S. version titled, ""Beyond the Door"", but it's a total waste.  The video resolution is inferior to VHS, and is pretty much unwatchable.  What a disappointment.

302817,4,6301004965,"This movie is Showgirls bad. And yes, it shamelessly rips off The Exorcist as well as Rosemary's Baby but that's where all the fun begins. Seriously, if you were looking for a mind blowing shriek fest would you really be picking a 70s Italian exploitation flick with a title like Beyond the Door (fyi, the title under this print is The Devil Within Her)?

  The story is about a woman who becomes pregnant under mysterious circumstances and, as a result, is turned into a green faced, foul mouth demon that throws up buckets of the green stuff, finds time to make out with her own son, spins her head around, levitates, and terrorizes her two equally foul mouthed brats. In other words, your typical unappreciated suburban soccer mom. All the while, her KFed husband goes about his day as if nothing is seriously wrong. What she doesn't know is that her Satanic ex-boyfriend has made a pact with the Devil to give him her child in exchange for an unspecified lifespan. Unfortunately for this Anton LeVey wanna be, the Devil has few tricks up his sleeve for him.

  As I stated before, the print that was used to make this dvd was the extended The Devil Within Her and is actually quite good in terms of presentation especially when you consider some of the other titles Code Red tends to produce (ie Sweet Sixteen and Redeemer: Son of Satan). Though not at all perfect like Anchor Bay or Blue Underground, all the print flaws here only seem to add to the whole grindhouse aura. And the special features more than make up for it.

  I own the special 2 disc set that was a Best Buy exclusive and this set included the U.S. theatrical cut under the proper name Beyond the Door. This print, like the afore mentioned Sweet Sixteen's theatrical cut, is truly abysmal in its presentation. Colors bleed, the screen is so dark at times where you can barely make out what's going on in the scene, and the sound tends to drop and fade in places. But if you have the patience to overlook these flaws you will find that the two cuts vary greatly from one another and do offer two entirely different viewing experiences. All in all, not bad.  Its not The Exorcist or Emily Rose but its good for a laugh. Now if only a Riff Tracks can be made to go along with BtD.

302892,3,6301004965,"...this is a bad movie. Genuinely bad. Copycat script, awful sound dubbing, cheesy acting, terrible production values; technically, it's an abortion. But despite all this, what stands out, are the visuals; the visual impact of ""Beyond The Door"" is genuinely terrifying.

To write, produce, and direct a horror movie about demonic possession which is truly original, is nearly impossible. It has been done many, many, many times, by many, many, many people over the years, so it's a given - there will be some thematic material which will overlap with prior work by others, but in this case, some of the scenes depicted in this film from 1974 directly echo ""The Exorcist,"" from 1973: the floating body, the gutteral voice of the possessed, projectile vomiting bile on a person who is trying to help, the rotating head, the list goes on. There was so much mimicry that Warner Brothers, who owned Bill Friedkin's masterpiece, actually took the film makers of ""Beyond The Door"" to court for copyright infringement. The legal matters worked out, ""Beyond The Door"" went into general release, and despite being derided and maligned by critics and many ticket buyers alike, it has survived as a cult film (no pun intended).

I have to say, when I first saw it on a weekly Saturday late-night program (""Chiller Theater,"" for those who lived near Pittsburgh, Pa in the late 1970's), it scared the living daylights out of me. I expected something creepy, but I had no idea. Yes, it's a slightly altered ""Rosemary's Baby"" with visuals and a soundtrack inspired by ""The Exorcist,"" but lost on those who didn't give it a chance is, this really is a genuinely frightening film. The look on Juliet Mills' face during some of sequences depicting demonic activity stayed with me long (!) after the movie ended. I never expected anything like this; I remembered her from a television series of the 1960's called ""Nanny And The Professor,"" where she portrayed a sophisticated, yes, you guessed it, nanny who was hired to care for a professor's family; a harmless family-friendly weekly situation comedy. So it was shocking to see her acting so strange in this film.

If you watch this movie, just keep  this warning in mind: it has many copy-cat elements and it has poor production values which could impede your enjoyment of it, provided you do enjoy something like this.

Objective fact: ""Beyond The Door"" is very derivitave, and cheaply made.
Subjective opinion: Despite its shortcomings, it is a terrifying film.

Good luck sleeping after watching it.",1294876800,12,2535,4.938967136150235

302894,4,6301004965,"Recalling the ""Exorcist"" as one of the most horrifying movies of all time gives one pause to consider why that movie touched such a raw nerve. First off, it involved the demonic possession of a pre-teen girl. Teenaged years are bad enough, but what if the usual hormonal traumas of adolescence get mixed up with (or confused for) demonic possession? That is, for me, is what made the Exorcist a classic movie. The same can be said for ""Beyond the Door"". Dismissed as an Exorcist rip-off, this movie received terrible treatment, though it was a box-office success at the time of its release. The premise of this movie is equally disturbing. A pregnant (Juliet Mills) is living through a troubling pregnancy. It's bad enough that Juliet Mills, who charmed me in ""Nanny and the Professor"", is the victim of possession in this one, but the notion that a person can be taken at their most vulnerable state touches more than a few raw nerves. Given the hormonal swings that pregnant women can go through, it may not be that difficult to confuse crazy moodiness with demonic possession. Shoot in dark shadows, with carefully lit scenes, the movie reflects beautifully the style of classic Italian horror movies of the day. The effects are effective, as are the sound effects, which compound the viewer's terror. Mills turns in an outstanding performance, turning from one moment from campy antics, to sheer terror freak-out. Thirty-five years later, this movie remains an effective piece of work.",1282608000,,1489,4.936254980079681
302895,5,6301004965,"i remember first seeing the tv ads for this movie and it gave me the creeps! at the time of its release, ""the excorcist"" was about to be re-released in theaters and warner brothers did not like the fact that there was another possession film coming out at the same time! The buzz about this film was so well received that there were lines around the block at grauman's chinese theatre!
 when warner brothers heard of this movie, they decided to file a lawsuit against the filmmakers, citing visual copyright infringement(?) even though there might have been a similarity or two, both movies really have nothing in common story wise. this movie has more in common with ""rosemary's baby"" than with ""the excorcist."" at the time my mom took me to see the excorcist which i loved tremendously, yet here was this movie that was stuck in the back of my mind, beckoning me to see it! i did not get to see it until maybe in late 1986 on a god awful looking vhs copy, and you know what? i loved it!
  Horror films these days are a dime a dozen, nothing truly memorable. i think hollywood and some of these so-called indie filmmakers forgot how to make a good creepy flick.
  the story is quite simple, woman gets possessed, all hell breaks loose yet there's something lurking within, that's where things get really interesting. i recently purchased this movie on dvd and played it for my son. Luckily he gave it a shot of watching it and lo and behold the same results!  For all its 70's fashion and other trappings, Beyond the Door still holds up after all these years. I think the same goes to anyone curious about seeing this film should forget about what theyve seen these days. forget about the cgi effects and bid productions and get yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy this little film that could

There is also a fine introduction with actress Juliet Mills, a woman who can make your nerves jangle when the opportunity calls. the audio is in mono, originally it was supposed to include the quadrophonic sound they used in some theaters, but it wasn't available for this release, otherwise a clear sounding mono mix. the commentary track is a nice touch, one with the director and another with star Juliet Mills and producers. forget about the cgi effects and big productions and get yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy this little film that could! my only hope is that this title gets the blu ray treatment in the near future.",1270425600,2,2657,4.606765327695561

302979,3,6301004965,"To begin with,let's state the obvious, shall we. Yes, ""Beyond the Door"" is a ""Rosemary's Baby/Exorcist"" rip-off. Yes, ""Beyond the Door"" is a ""devil-possessed"" exploitation film with an uneven script, bad
character development and fair acting..at best!

That stated, there's something interesting about ""Beyond the Door"".
The premise alone is worth the price of admission and while not nearly as effective as it should have been. Beyond the Door, definitely has it's moments.

For instance, The ""possession"" scenes. Juliet Mills looks ghoulish and
scary. The fact that she's not OVERLY made-up is a plus! In addition,the whole dubbing-dialogue-acting during these scenes are outrageous...a definite treat.

The special effects, while not incredible, aren't painfully bad either. For example, the literal ""head-turning"" scene isn't as outlandish as the head turn Ms. Linda Blair took in the ""The Exorcist"" but still looks very creepy.

Despite it's flaws and derivative nature ""Beyond the Door"" manages to create a strange atmosphere throughout...probably due to it's nutty ""script"" along with it's equally unbalanced score.

This film, as with other odd-ball ""70's Horror""
didn't necessarily strive to make sense from start to finish in order to ""satisfy"" the viewer. That's what made ""70's horror"" more interesting...a bit more interpretative on the viewers behalf. For younger viewers, however, this film might be too disjointed to enjoy.

Nevertheless, ""Beyond the Door"" is a MUST for fans of ""devil/possession""
films that [briefly] ruled the silver-screen in the early 70's!

302982,1,6301004965,"BEYOND THE DOOR may not be the greatest horror film ever made but it deserves much better treatment than this poor quality DVD-R affords it. Try Code Red's release of this underappreciated film (also available from Amazon) for a far superior quality presentation.

This is actually a pretty good Italian possession film that really shines, given a chance.  Check out the Code Red release - it's by far the best of the bunch!

302983,5,6301004965,"If you like Exorcist schlock, bad acting, horrible dubbing, a younger Juliet Mills, then this should come as a special treat. I first saw this film in 1975 at the age of seven at a drive in somewhere in New Jersey and it scared the crap out of me. It's one of my personal favorites and I definitely would prefer this film over such crap as ""Exorcist II:The Heretic"".",1229817600,,366,4.318840579710145

I'm sure if a better video version of this movie is made available for purchase, and this company sold it, I would definitely buy from them again! A+",1229126400,,338,4.467741935483871

But didn't know what it was called. I did a google image search for ""possesed"" child and a pic of the character of little Ken with the glowing eyes and the possessed dolls. I absolutely love this film for nostalgic reasons. I saw it at the drive in when I was 5 years old and it scared the crap out of me. I've been trying to find it for years. Cool Italian Exorcist/Rosemary's Baby rip-off. Groovy soundtrack and hilarious dubbing. Love it.",1229126400,4,491,4.406593406593407
302986,2,6301004965,"while it's based on good, solid rip-off material... Beyond the Door doesn't deliver.  nothing worthwhile happens for the first 45 minutes or so.  while this is a strength in great films like The Exorcist, badly dubbed Italian exploitation flicks like this get douched... hard!

more boring than thrilling.  the few good possession moments at the end did not justify the initial two thirds of the movie.  too bad, could have been awesome in the hands of Fulci, Argento, or the guy who directed Cannibal Holocaust.

302988,3,6301004965,"Beyond The Door is a great flick to enjoy popcorn and your favorite beverage with. The other reviewers have already mentioned the fact that it's a blatant Italian produced Exorcist rip-off but the original film was super serious while this is just a good time. I enjoyed the funky Blaxploitation soundtrack and cheesy dubbing as well as yesteryear's special effects. This is a grindhouse classic and I'm just happy to see it released properly. Now, if only someone could put out a remastered dvd of William Girdler's Abby (The Black Exorcist).",1226275200,,543,4.978021978021978
303019,4,6301004965,"Finally the movie on dvd!! Its the same movie with dvd quality. Still some bad acting and chessy parts, but the good parts are still good!! Its a classic, don't matter if its a ripp-off of exorcist, it still in there on its own, and still a creepy movie. This release in October 2008 by CODERED is the real deal, don't fall for the dvd copies out there on a dvdr, you might as well have the vhs if you get that one.",1225670400,,415,4.0120481927710845

303021,4,6301004965,"Yes, this is a knock-off of ""The Exorcist"", but despite that, it's still a cool movie. It was virtually a staple of drive-in theaters during the latter half of the 1970's as well as the Late Late Show on CBS as another reviewer pointed out.

Juliet Mills (from ""Nanny & The Professor"" fame) completely abandoned her squeaky-clean image in favor of cursing in a guttural voice & regurgitating blood & green goop. The dubbing is a bit on the cheesy side, especially from the children; the little girl in particular comes up with some pretty hilarious lines.  Replying to the little boy when he cries after seeing Juliet Mills hurling an ashtray & destroying the fish tank: ""You're blowing my mind, man!! You gotta stop that or you're gonna have a bad trip"", sort of like an 8-year old hippie!

""Beyond The Door"" was filmed partially in Italy as well as San Francisco & has several different titles: ""The Devil Within Her"", which appears at the beginning of this version, as well as ""Chi Sei?"" (which means ""Who Are You?"" in Italian, a reference to one of Mills' lines in the film) & ""Diabolica"".  Director/producer Ovidio G. Assonitis was directly involved with Code Red in making this available on DVD, providing the original uncut camera negative. Transferring it to anamorphic widescreen, the overall quality is amazing, considering that this film has turned up in some poor quality, grainy & edited versions on VHS over the years.

There are some cool extras on this DVD, including a short featurette ""Beyond The Door: 35 Years Later"" featuring recent interviews with Mills, Richard Johnson & Ovidio G. Assonitis. Mills mentions that she hasn't seen or heard from costar Gabriele Lavia since after the film was shot in 1974. Also featured are the original theatrical trailer & TV spot, still photo gallery, & candid, funny interview with Richard Johnson called ""An Englishman In Italy"".",1222732800,20,1888,4.8875
303022,3,6301004965,"A veritable staple of the CBS LATE MOVIE in the early 80s, this ersatz Exorcist used to give me the willies when I was a kid (and as I had a thing for Julliette Mills, I wanted to give her the willie...but seeing her spew vomit and give birth to ol' hornhead's kid pretty much cured me of that). Great to see this finally get a legitimate release, after suffering through some perfectly awful boots over the years....",1218153600,8,417,4.358974358974359
303023,5,6301004965,"Yes, this is a blatant Exorcist rip-off. Who cares? It's terrific fun and a great throwback to the wonderful exploitation Italian horror flicks of the 1970s.

303024,2,6301004965,"Juliette Mills was a tv hit in Nanny and the Professor, in this film she is more in need of Nanny 911.

It was HARD to sit through. Awful acting, directing ,script..everything. Aboid this movie like the plague. It also is on a DVD-R in cheap packaging.",1180224000,3,374,4.194444444444445

I never seen the movie back then so I finally found it online through Amazon and HAD to purchase it! I'm glad I did even though it's not a great movie. I think I did it because of nostalgic reasons,the thought of being scared back then not knowing what the movie was about since I was too young to go see it.

In the 70's, the trailer used to come on TV and scared the poop out of me (I was about 8 or 9)!
The imagery was just terrifying!
Years later, I found at the Detroit Public Library and it was the dumbest thing I ever saw.
I think I laughed more than anything. Not even close to scary. It's an Italian production and everyone is dubbed except for Juliet Mills (Nanny and the Professor fame).

7808738,5,6301004965,As a long time fan of this film I've tried to obtain different copies of it over the years. This version is a DVD-R rip. Not sure of it's origin.. Nostalgia Family possibly ripped it from the Code Red release from a few years back?.. This is the full length version of the film titled THE DEVIL WITHIN HER which actually contains more footage than the US released version as BEYOND THE DOOR. No inside graphics or liner notes. The DVD itself has no menu to speak of. The film starts as soon as it's inserted in player. The overall picture and audio are good considering it's a DVD-R rip. It's in widescreen as well. If you don't have a copy of this film.. It's not a bad investment considering it's less than $5. I'm looking forward to this title hopefully being remastered in 4K in the near future.. Probably just up converted to 2K in reality. I'm giving a 5 star review based on the film itself. Packaging left a lot to be desired.. I guess it's better than not having access to the film at all as it's currently out of print elsewhere to the best of my knowledge. Great creepy movie. Get it!..,1485561600,3,1097,4.330097087378641
