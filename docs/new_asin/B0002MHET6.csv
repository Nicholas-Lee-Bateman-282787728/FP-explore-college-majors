I was humbled by what I saw in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warren-Miller-s-Storm/dp/B0000AVHD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warren Miller's Storm</a>&nbsp;so I sought out a few others, starting with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warren-Miller-s-Journey/dp/B0002MHET6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warren Miller's Journey</a>.

Like most Warren Miller productions, the tricks and scenery will blow you away if you have ever tried to ski or snowboard.  It is amazing they are even able to capture shots like these.

Clearly Warren is a legend who has no trouble getting people to be a part of his movies.  The locations and types of shoots are varied and cover several continents.  There is some mind-bending footage here, but that comes as no surprise.

One thing applies to all these tricks, and it bears repeating: don't try any of this.  There is no instruction here.  This is extreme sports entertainment set to a backdrop of music and interweaving stories and interviews.  That's all.

Each Warren Miller movie I watch leaves me with more respect for the risks of being on the mountain.

The soundtrack is not as good as in Storm, but it's still done well for the scenes.

I plan on buying all the other Warren Miller stuff I haven't seen yet.  I hope you will give this a look.

Enjoy!",1213401600,2,1450,5.741784037558685
2105189,5,B0002MHET6,"And as good as the ski and snowboard coverage is, the part at the end with Loic Jean Albert doing 100+ mph down the face of the mountain in a wingsuit blew my mind.  Link to YouTube below...you have to see this to believe it.  It's one thing to see folks using wingsuits while skydiving, but the way Albert does it skimming the surface of the mountain gives it a perspective that is the closest thing to human flight I've ever seen:

2105190,5,B0002MHET6,"Hello, this is a great ski vid. Warren takes you all over the world, from Alaska to Morrocco. Great Skiing and even some ok Boarding. Awesome scenary. And of course, legendary story line and narration. Still doesn't beat Blizzard of Ah's though.",1161993600,4,245,4.857142857142857
2105191,4,B0002MHET6,"This is one of the finer ski movies that I've seen (and I've seen quite a few). The footage is really awesome, with plenty of close shots, very skillfully and professionally done. FIVE STARS for that.

Warren Miller's commentary throughout the film is actually interesting and informative -- for example, the Aspen Ski Patrol segment. The annoying part is that his voice is often overpowered by the lame music and you have to try hard to understand what he's saying. And, yes, the soundtrack itself isn't that great.

The athlete profiles in the special features are really nicely done. Nothing to do with the brainless ""performances"" in movies like Soul Purpose, which seem to promote stupidity and ignorant behavior.

Overall, it's worth buying. Good production.",1107302400,11,764,5.096
2105192,4,B0002MHET6,"I purchased this DVD and was real exited about watching it. When I pooped it in I was diasappointed with the soundtrack. The music is not something you associate with skiing but rather with getting a massage. The music also reminded me of something you would play before/while making love to your lover. Also, Mr. Miller's commentary and voiceovers are kind of annoying and sometimes get in the way of really great footage. Now that thats over, I must say the visually the film is excellent. The video highlights big moutain skiing with some snowboarding and freestyle skiing put in here and there. Also, the footage of someguy jumping out of a helicopter over the summit and gliding 15 above the snow and then over jagged tops is amazing. Bottom line: buy the DVD and watch it on TV (MUTE the VOL) with your favorite jams in the background.",1105228800,7,841,4.651006711409396
