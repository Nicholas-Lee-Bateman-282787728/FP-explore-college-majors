2679296,4,B000JU8H9M,"When they say, ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"", this is what they mean, for all the good and the bad that implies. A sincere, beautifully acted and photographed melodrama in the classical style, ""Miracle in the Rain"" should please fans of these things. Jane Wyman is wonderful, and her prayer scene in St. Patrick's cathedral, after her lover departs, is a gem. That the film wanders for a while and takes too many side roads is forgivable, considering the impact and mysticism of the final scene, which fans will remember fondly and which I won't spoil here. The print on this DVD is fine, and the image crisp and sharp (though it looks as if they've used the Lucille Ball ""Mame"" filter on all of Wyman's close-ups). Perhaps it's not all you've heard it to be, but still well worth a look for its unabashed sentiment and stylish presentation. Fans of Wyman's other glossy '50's soap operas should seek this out: it gives the same feeling as ""All that Heaven Allows"".",1171324800,15,975,4.641618497109826
2679297,5,B000JU8H9M,This movie is on my top 10 of favorite classics. As the reviewer before me stated it is a tear jerker. I am anticipating the dvd release.,1164585600,7,137,4.111111111111111
2679298,5,B000JU8H9M,"Wonderful classic tear jerker. The movie is filmed in New York City in the 1940's. Jane Wyman is a spinster who works for a small shoe company. Her life consists of going to work and caring for her insecure mother.  Her father left for another woman and the mother never got over it.  One rainy day, she meets a soldier, played by Van Johnson. There first date is chaperoned by her best friend, Eileen Hackett. While walking around in the city, they are drawn to an auction.  For some strange reason, Jane feels she must buy an old Roman coin. This coin, will be the miracle of the story.  After a few dates, they begin to fall in love and he is called off to war. Ladies, make sure you have tissues when watching this movie.",1162339200,35,725,4.3088235294117645
2679305,5,B000JU8H9M,"This is a great film! A hidden gem as they say. As a guy who doesn't like romance films, I absolutely loved this one. Why? Because it's not a real ""romancey"" type of film. It's just about two lonely people who find each other. I also love it because of the great dialogue. Watching Art pull Ruthie out of her funk with his jovial personality is simply wonderful. I love it when shy Ruthie shows up on their first date with her friend Grace and up walks Art with three tickets to the show. Ruthie, perplexed, wonders: ""But...how did you know?"" Art replies nonchalantly: ""Oh, I know everything!"" He knew, after knowing her only a short time, that she would probably bring a friend along for support.

Then after the show, they all go to a restaurant. Ruthie is so anxious and awkward but Art pulls her right out of it with his bubbly manner. He makes them both feel comfortable and special. Soon they are all talking and having a good time. He's a true gentleman. Watching the restaurant scene is like watching three real people having a conversation. It was like they weren't acting, it all just flowed so naturally. Who wouldn't love to have a buddy like Art? Seeing Ruthie come out of her shell is a joy to watch. I also love the scene where Grace tries to comfort Ruthie when she is sad. These characters all care deeply about one another and as a result you care about them too, at least I did.

While it's true that the ending is a little ""romancey"", I still love this movie. This is one of those movies that would never be considered anything more than a 2 star film by the professional critics yet, I enjoy it more than most 4 star films that are considered classics.",1497571200,4,1673,4.393548387096774

2679384,5,B000JU8H9M,"I give a  movie five stars if it compels me to watch it again, and this one did.  It resonated with me on many levels; music, actors, story, spirituality, and its haunting quality, making me wistfully think about it again and again.  Hearing the opening music put me in the mood for a good, old-fashioned movie night of classic entertainment.  I love Franz Waxman's score for this movie.  His jaunty opening theme belies what is to come and made the whole viewing experience all the more ironic and unexpected. I love Jane Wyman and Van Johnson in their other movies and this one did not disappoint.  At this writing (2014) Van Johnson is still alive and one can read his biography which is fascinating. And, if watching this DVD on a high-def big screen TV, one can see the real-life scars on his forehead from a devastating car accident he was involved in, in which he was practically scalped. It makes his acting all the more poignant. The World War Two 'meet-cute' story is enchanting and one must be in a spiritually-minded mood to really get the most out of this. The plot is firmly representative of the era it was made, when Hollywood did not shy away from religiously-oriented themes and understood its core audience to resonate to inspiration from heavenly realms.  Not that this movie bangs one over the head with church-y themes--it has a great supporting cast with some va-va-voom music and fun which is a bright ray of contrast to the main plot.  Anyone, religious or a-religious will be uplifted by this movie.  The DVD is great with a couple of informative bonus features.  Story is beguiling, music is wonderful; seeing these actors at work makes one nostaligic for Hollywood's bygone classic era, and Van Johnson's cheerful optimism is worth the time spent, getting to know this classic movie.",1394668800,4,1811,4.757188498402556

Could there be anything more romantic or memorable than to meet someone in the rain? This is a heart-warming and yet tragic war-time story. It sets the same tone as A Guy Named Joe, which is another one of my favorite movies. Just as Art says, ""Love never dies"", still rings true today. If you've ever loved anyone, and lost them without saying goodbye, this helps you know that Love really never does die. The ones we hold dear to our hearts, no matter who they are, are always with us when we give Love freely and remember them with the warmest thoughts. Love is the tie that binds, no matter how strained it may be.",1319328000,2,717,4.202898550724638

Her father left 10 years ago, so she had no man in her life, even in family. He, a soldier visiting New York as he waits for where they wish to send him.
New York City is another part of the story.
A coin is bought at an aution a roman coin. which comes in later as a key part to the film.

To add to Hurley's Review-Jane Wyman's composer father-who had earlier abandoned Jane and her Mother, returns home after hearing his music had now acquired lyrics and the song was very populour.
He discovers that Jane was not only very ill but was missing.
She had returned to St Patrick's Cathedral where she collapsed on the doorstep.

The real miracle is that she was found holding a Roman coin-the very same one she had bought at an Auction, and given to Van Johnson before he went off to the War. Before she collapsed she had a vision in which she saw van Johnson. She had earlier been notified that he had died. He returned the coin to her; tearfully,  she said but you have died. He said: ""True love never dies; where I am I don't need the good luck piece any more"".

This movie really broke my heart for a while and I cried very much but it is so wonderfully made. All the performances are great, the story is great (I especially like the ending) and I love the main song of the movie called ""I'll always believe in you"". The scene when Jane and Van sit at the piano and sing is really nice.
I own this movie since about 3 weeks now and I watched it at least 10 times since then- I also showed it to many of my friends and to my family and we all fell in love with ""Miracle in the Rain"".
If you want to have a nice, calm movie about NYC and two souls who found each other there and fell in love, go and buy this movie. You won't be disappointed.

2679431,4,B000JU8H9M,"I write this review on the news day that Van Johnson left us at 92. Don't bother with critics who herald his more well known films. This is a career performance, his best role ever. There's an all too convincing innocence complimented by sweet co-star Jane Wyman that just gets to you in deep poignant places that other poorly cast films don't dare to tread.

Wyman stars as a sad, lonely lady lost in the big city in unconscious quest of romantic self fulfillment. Johnson is her dashingly positive upbeat foil who wins her heart just before he goes to war. And that she should lose him makes this a retro reality show for the old adage that life is often what happens to you when you're busy making other plans.

Johnson was a leading man and Wyman his leading lady in a day and age when there was still room for shmaltz and sentimentality in American cinema because the ranks of the Hollywood film community were seasoned by less cynicism and more idealism. And that such a mindset depicts a sad love affair is testament to the power of faith or hope vs. despair.

This doomed love story features a spiritual combination of religious and supernatural plot twists that set it apart from other romances made in the 50s. People unable to deal with sadness in cinema are cautioned to pass on this. But for those who like their entertainment to express a full range of emotional experience, this film is a heart wrenching epic.

Again, let me stress easy-going film fans of comedy relief or cut and dried happy endings will not appreciate or understand this offbeat tale. It takes a bold soul to deal with the brief bliss and eternal sorrow of two star crossed lovers whose fate makes the film but breaks your heart. A lost gem of the 50s, Miracle is the blackboard jungle of tearjerkers.",1229126400,2,1786,4.554517133956386

At a time when we have so few examples of these things in today's cinema, and in much of the media at large, it's comforting to curl up with a nice mug of hot cocoa and a box of soft tissues and enjoy a film that brings a good feeling in your heart.

2679440,5,B000JU8H9M,"Miracle in the Rain is the story of a typical girl from New York. Ruth (Jane Wyman) works in an office and lives with her mother. Her father ran away when she was younger, and her mother desperately hopes for his return. As a result, she warns Ruth away from men, but they prove to be unavoidable. A solider on leave, Art Hugenon, stumbles upon her in the rain one day. He tags along to her home for dinner and spends the next few days taking her to the park, out to dinner, and anywhere else she wants to go. He is called to battle sooner than he had hoped, but leaves an engagement ring with Ruth and a promise of his love for her.

This is not your typical wartime romance; it is much more realistic than a film like The Clock with Judy Garland. However, it retains the classic movie touch that makes it a million times more emotional and memorable than any movie made today. The two stars are wonderful in their parts. Wyman says so much without uttering a word, and Johnson's boyish charms leave no one guessing as to how Ruth could fall so quickly.

There are some wonderful extra features included here like a short about how film is processed and another that visits the set of this movie and interviews its stars. They are sparse, but worthwhile.",1188950400,6,1255,4.358974358974359
2679441,4,B000JU8H9M,"`Miracle in the Rain' is a could-be classic.  Off the radar screen, `Miracle...' is an offbeat adventure, celebrating ordinary people coming to life when able to do so.  Both romantic and religious, it stars Jane Wyman in a remarkable performance as Ruth Wood, a spinster caught in life's dreary web.  She meets Private Art Huegenot (played with lively spirit by Van Johnson*--not my favorite actor--in a role of a lifetime.)  The developments are life-changing and exuberant.

The story begins with Ruth going to work.  Quiet, she works in an office with a blond bombshell who makes out with the boss in his office.  Nearby, a young man keeps a map in front and keeps track of the raging war.  And as a consolation, a kindly woman offers to take the edge off of Ruth's solitary existence.  Later, in a New York rainstorm, she bumps into Private Art, who, given a pass to enjoy the city, can only glower about rain and everything else.  Charming the socks off Ruth, who knows nothing but her day job and her night support of her ailing and abandoned mother, he convinces her to let him show her the town she`s never seen before.  Cautiously, she warms up to him.  When there's freedom at point zero, both the colorful extravert and the shy recluse hit it off.  Then, the specter of war looms over them both.  Having lost her father who abandoned both her mother and herself, she can only feel bitterly cheated, missing out on a brief awakening in her sadly pedestrian life.  The movie interweaves the stories skillfully many years before modern movies like today do.

`Miracle in the Rain' deserves to be unearthed by classic movie fans.  At first the characters and development are genuine and believable.  Later, a good film becomes a fine one with loose ends coming together and a satisfying resolution for those who love old-fashioned movies.  Rent or buy 'Miracle in the Rain,' and it could the next 'It's a Wonderful Life'.

2679445,5,B000JU8H9M,"""I love you as if I'd always known you. I'll be back as if I'd never left you."" -- Van Johnson

Jane Wyman is wonderful as a lonely woman brought to life by the unexpected attention of soldier Van Johnson in this tender soaper. Though it doesn't have quite the charm of ""The Clock"" with Garland and Walker, there is something very real and ultimately moving about this bittersweet story of falliing in love during wartime.

Ruthie (Wyman) lives in New York where she takes care of her heartbroken mother, still shell-shocked years after Ruthie's father called one night to say he was leaving. It has not allowed the sweet Ruthie much of a life outside her job and mother. When she meets a soldier in an elevator named Art (Van Johnson), his warm and friendly manner is just the right medicine for Ruthie, who's never really been noticed.

Johnson really shines in a role tailor-made for his boyish charm. He is lonely too, and masks his need with constant chatter so that Ruthie can't tell him to go away. Art sort of invites himself to dinner and over the next two days they paint a  picture of love's transforming magic, which does not always take huge amounts of time. It is a picture painted on a canvas of fresh grass in Central Park, boat races, and a city made for falling in love.

When Art's 153rd is slated to pull out, however, their happiness is interrupted. It is the small touches, such as Ruthie's pride in a story Art gets publised in the paper, and a truck full of soldiers yelling goodbye to Ruthie when Art leaves that make this film rise above its soap opera origins. Ben Hecht's script, based on his own story, doesn't hurt either. A lovely and subtle score by Franz Waxman adds just the right mood to this special film.

Writing Art every day until he can write her back, a letter finally arrives for a lonely Ruthie, waiting for the voice and words which will make her heart live again. To reveal more would be unforgivable to anyone with a romantic heart who hasn't seen this yet. I can only say that a scene in the rain is a poignant moment never forgotten by those who have seen it, either recently or years ago.

A great cast gives Johnson and Wyman the room they need for two lost souls to find each other. Those with a romantic heart will find much to enjoy with this film, finally available on DVD.",1175126400,64,2328,4.437939110070258

2679448,5,B000JU8H9M,"I just love the weepers. You know, the stuff that Bette Davis and Joan Crawford seemed to have a patent on in the early to mid-40's. I am continually telling my like-minded friends that Hollywood stopped making 3+ hanky movies after 1949. (Not a completely true statement on my part, but def. a heart felt one as I really like the oldies the best).

Well, I somewhat reluctantly settled back with this dvd and a bowl of popcorn on a snowy day in Chicago and the flood gates just opened up. I yanked the box of Kleenex out and cried through at least half the movie. As wonderful as Jane Wyman was in Johnny Belinda, I really think this is as good or possibly even better a movie because of her sensitive performance. Wyman just seems to have this innate ability to act with her expressive face. She doesn't need a lot of dialogue or hysteria. Wow, what a scene stealer! As for the other players, Van Johnson delivers his usual stellar performance as the nice, 'gee whiz' sort of young man that he seemingly had the corner on in all the old MGM movies he was in and Eileen Heckert is great as Wyman's friend. Still this is a Wyman movie, no doubt about it.

As for the quality of the print, it was very good. My only question was why did this movie languish in an underground vault (apparently unviewed for so many years)? I have to assume that the powers-that-be knew they were sitting on a gold mine that was just waiting for the advent of home video.

Anyway, make sure you have a full box of Kleenex before you sit down to watch this one so you won't have to stop it midway into the movie.",1173657600,11,1591,4.296666666666667

Wyman gives perhaps the greatest performance of her career, possibly rivaling her performance in ""Johnny Belinda"" (for which she won the coveted oscar). she is such a cutie. you cannot resist falling in love her with.

as for the DVD, the transfer is excellent and the sound adequate, though on some player you may have to adjust the volume higher than normal.",1172361600,30,637,5.009433962264151
