1518829,5,B00005JN3W,"I wasn't expecting what I got from this film. I cried virtually from beginning to end. I really really loved it and would recommend it to anyone who has a sensitive bone in their body - and even those who don't.

Besides, isn't Kate Hudson worth going to watch?",1095897600,5,261,4.326530612244898
1518830,1,B00005JN3W,"A lazy charmless and unfunny retread of a thousand other sudsy ""warmedy"" type films and tv series you have seen over and over...some of them by the same Garry Marshall who directs here. As another reviewer comments, this is virtually the identical plot of the tv show ""Summerland"".

 I am deeply troubled by films and tv shows that exploit the ""dead mommy"" thing. (There are dead daddy themes, but not nearly as many.) It's milked for sadness and yet there is an underlying theme that it would be more ""fun"" to be raised by an oddball relative, hipster, neighbor or even a stranger than your own mom. Aside from the fact that it is terribly untrue and disparaging of motherhood and women in general, there is a lot of latent misogynism here.

 Kate Hudson had a delightful debut as the whimsical groupie in ""Almost Famous"", and has unfortunately used up most of her credibility and audience appeal with one lame movie after another: ""Alex and Emma"", ""Le Divorce"", etc. It is beginning to seem painfully clear that she is very cute, but can't really do much heavy lifting in the acting department.

 It's an even bigger crime to have to watch the legendary Helen Mirren playing a small, second-banana part as the heroine's bitchy boss. Hector Elizondo is similarly wasted in a small, one dimensional part as a used car dealer, while John Corbett is basically ruining the good movie karma he built up with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" by playing the same part over and over, but with less charm each time.

 The worst served actor here, however, is poor Joan Cusack. I think she's one of the most talented and attractive comediennes working today, but she just get stuck with thankless roles of girlfriends or co-workers, often portrayed as whiny or unattractive and manless. Here she is hugely pregnant throughout the film and depicted as an anal retentive type, instead of simply as a good and competent mom. She has to be made somewhat unsympathetic to make the Kate Hudson character look good...God forbid they both be good and decent and complex characters.

 There is little to say about the plot which is a retread of a thousand other movies and tired tv shows: Helen (Kate Hudson) is a 23 year old fashion assistent who has two 40- something sisters. She is given custody of one sister's three children when the sister and her husband die in an auto collision. Despite the fact that the sister lived in a huge, expensive suburban home, there seems to be no life insurance. Nor do the three children seem to be collecting Social Security Orphans Benefits from BOTH parents, as they are entitled to....because Helen is forced to move them all into a small, dumpy apartment in Queens. Since the local public schools are not good enough, they have to go to an expensive Lutheran parochial school (despite not being Lutheran or seemingly any other religion). The Lutheran Pastor/School Principal starts dating Helen, despite a 20 year age difference and the obvious conflict of interest involved in dating a student's mother/guardian.

 That's about it. No big laughs...no small laughs. No authentic tears, or recognizable human emotions. Nothing to say about Queens, about parochial schools, about the fashion industry. I also have to mention that ""Raising Helen"" has one of the worst, corniest and most predictable music scores I have ever had to sit through...they actually play Simon and Garfunkel's ""At the Zoo"" when the characters visit a zoo.

 Conclusion: a borefest. Not even a decent chick flick, because there are no love scenes, no interesting clothes, no romantic conflict, no snappy dialogue. Any normal guy would run screaming from this (or fall asleep). As for me...I've been burned at least three times now. No more Kate Hudson films for me.",1091059200,18,3757,4.85
1518831,2,B00005JN3W,"I just watched this movie at our local dollar theater and wanted to get online and vent my frustration!

 This movie was absolutely unrealistic and choppy. I won't go into the plot details like the other reveiwers have, but here are some of the many problems I had with the movie...

 The kids grief processes are not dealt with- there is a family get-together for the funeral and then off they go with their new mom to Queens! what? And Kate Hudson seems vaguely concerned about the effects of the parents death on their children when she notices the boy drawing skulls. Also, the entire premise of Hudson being chosen as the guardian in her sister's will is rediculous- how can a normal adult entrust children's futures on the basis of the lyrics to a Devo song, and the fact that kate matches the deceased mothers personality more and will hopefully grow into the woman she can become or something.. just crap... and how is Hudson supporting an apartment, private school tuition and all living expenses for three children and herself on a job as a used car salesman/secretary?

 And not to mention how out of place the emotional scenes were... I will admit the deep scenes were very good on average, but they stuck out.. the tone of the movie changed too quickly... I felt there weren't enough bridging scenes in the movie to keep ideas flowing smoothly... and at the very end, the pretty music montage should've been played to a slow motion reel of the family dancing to whip it good, not normal speed- this made me laugh, much to the dismay of those seated in front of me- why were they crying anyway!

 And the most important fact of all- didn't the will state that if Hudson was unable or unwilling to be the caregiver, she didn't have to? So why was the subject of Kate being forced to do this even an issue in many of the sisters fights? Maybe I missed something? eh. If they made a sequel to this movie it should focus on how screwed up the kids are, lol.

 IN CONCLUSION- If you have never had the thought of a movie not flowing well, not making sense, not being scripted in reality, then this movie is a sweet tale that will make you feel good. If you have had these aforementioned thoughts, they will distract you so much that I doubt you will enjoy the film overall.",1090972800,7,2280,4.459134615384615

1518902,4,B00005JN3W,"The vivacious and vibrant Kate Hudson lights up the screen as Helen Harris, a young and upwardly mobile woman whose world comes crashing down around her ears after one of her sisters dies and unexpectedly wills her sisters three young children over to her. You may be tempted to think from the cover that this is a romantic comedyand it is, but thats not really the main focus of this fine-for-the-family movie. Its more a dramedy with a comedy emphasis about the life and motivation changes that Helen experiences when she is forced into unwanted responsibility for her nieces and nephew and how she deals with an older sisters bitterness over and battling getting those children taken away from her. But youd be forgiven for expecting this to be mainly a comedy based on its marketing and cover and Hudsons twinkling, engaging smile! The movie takes it easy on the romantic development between Helen and a young priest who presides over the school where the kids go to, and he helps Helen transition away from regretting her former life and embracing her new one. Its all rather easy and certainly sanitized. Theres some laughs and some tears along the way. But its winsome and worth watching, and this is coming from a guy.",1500681600,,1226,4.76056338028169

1518965,4,B00005JN3W,"Helen Harris (Kate Hudson) was along with sister 'Lindsay' raised by elder sister 'Jenny' (Joan Cusack) after the death of
their mother....these days 'Helen' lives life to the full, and has a glittering career as C.E.O  in a top-flight model-agency
working with boss  'Dominique' (Helen Mirren) - life is good....however, 'Helen's' world is about to be turned upside down,
sister 'Lindsay' and her husband are killed in a car-accident...
When their Will is read 'Lindsay' and 'Paul' want 'Helen' to bring-up their three children 'Audrey' (Hayden Panettiere) -
'Henry' (Spencer Breslin) and 'Sarah' (Abigail Breslin) ...the request coming as a big-shock to both 'Helen' and indeed the
experienced mother 'Jenny'
Well, despite her lack of skills in the parenting department 'Helen' wanting to carry out 'Lindsay's' wishes sets about trying
to be a parent to the three......she'll soon find that trying to juggle her career around bringing the children up doesn't work,
she'll have to walk away from the job she loves.
There are a million things for 'Helen' to think of bringing up children, even if one 'Audrey' at 15 feels she should be considered
grown-up, one thing that has to be sorted is schooling, a local religeous-school seems an ideal choice.
The school-principal and Lutheran-Pastor soon takes a shine to 'Helen' and the children, he hopes for romance, however does
the once high-flyer see 'Paster Dan Parker' (John Corbett) in the same light ?
As time moves on, 'Helen' misses her old life-style and questions whether 'Lindsay' had made the right choice, so much so
she will turn to 'Jenny' to take charge....however, 'Helen' has become very attached to the children, which will leave her with
a decision to be made......had 'Lindsay' made the right choice all along ?......will romance with the Pastor blossom ?
There are many light-hearted and amusing moments along the way, though the film is tinged with a sad event, it is overall a
genuine feel-good movie.

1519016,4,B00005JN3W,"Naturally, being a guy, the manly man,......I'm not much for chick flicks, but when I read the IMDB description of the movie, I saw this movie actually has some intelligence in it! Bought it for cheap here.
The premise isn't complicated at all and more plays out like a comedy drama. Kate Hudson plays Helen,....who's got this great career w a modeling agency. Her world comes to a halt when her brother and sister-in-law both die in a car crash. Once that happens, her two nieces and nephew are left in her care.
There's lots of great laughs here that girls and guys would appreciate. I particularly liked how her sister, played by Joan Cusack went on a 'responsibility' rant in front of a 'crush' the oldest sibling has.
Anyways, I don't like long reviews and I honestly don't like tearing movies apart. It's good to be picky about the movies you watch, but it just seems people write quite a bit of stuff on how good or bad a movie really is. You'll enjoy this one.",1479427200,,968,4.47457627118644

Not even Joan Cusack (who had one good scene) or Helen Mirren (who had none) could save it. To be fair they didn't have a fighting chance. The script was written by Miss Moffet's 7th grade English class. (The assignment was: Write a screenplay consisting entirely of cliches from the worst romantic comedies in film history. Points taken off for anything clever, intelligent or remotely original.) What can you do with lines like: ""I got news for you, little lady. I'm a sexy man of God""...(make them stop, dear god, make them stop!)? Kate Hudson punctuated every single sentence with that annoying little smirk of hers, the three children were borrowed from Shaun of the Dead (yet another use for zombies), and if John Corbett is a Lutheran pastor, I'm Mahatma Gandhi. And, oh, the dreadful, sappy ""I could see this coming from a million miles away"" ending...the horror, the horror!

1519598,3,B00005JN3W,"Kate Hudson is adorable.  We all know this, we all agree with this, we all believe this wholesouled and the probably explains why we can't stay away from her movies, no matter how ridiculously unoriginal they may be.  That said; `Raising Helen' is one of those `been there done that, seen it all before' type films that, staring any other actor would be wept under the table and forgotten about long before it was ever released, but because it stars the undeniably luminous Hudson we all flock to it in hordes and adore it respectfully.

Yes, I like this movie, even though technically I don't think I'm supposed to.

The film tells the story of young, single, working woman Helen who has a huge career in the fashion world ahead of her.  She has everything going in the right direction; that is until her older sister Lindsay dies tragically and leaves her three kids in the care of Helen.  Helen seems like the odd choice.  She is goofy and single and seemingly unstable (even though her job is secure), and her other sister Jenny is married with children, responsible and `motherly', yet Lindsay chooses Helen to care for her children, and this sends shockwaves through the bones of everyone involved.  Helen has to get another apartment, she has to lessen her work load, she has to branch out in the community, and all of this puts a strain on her life.  Jenny has to struggle with hurt feelings as she feels like the better mother for the job and is outraged that Lindsay didn't see things that way.  Throw into the mix some teenage hormones and a cute preacher by the name of Pastor Dan and you have a sweet yet very familiar romantic dramedy that will suffice if there is nothing better to watch.

Hudson is adorable.  I think I already said that.  This is no exception.  She effortlessly shifts through each scene with believable likableness and earns our love and adoration.  I just really wish she would do something else with her career.  She was so promising in `Almost Famous' and I really thought that she would capitalize on that Oscar nomination by advancing for a more mature career, but she seems stuck making the same ol' same romantic comedy, one right after the other.  John Corbett is effective as the love interest.  He's handsome and charming he possesses this magnetic like manner, where you just know he is the right guy.  The film belongs to Joan Cusack though; I mean really, she should be in every movie (or at least every comedy).  She perfectly knows how to create a grounded character that is funny yet sincere.  I just love her.

`Raising Helen' is a sweet movie, and it has its moments (not to mention a hilarious supporting turn by Sakina Jaffrey) but I cannot lie to you and tell you that it is wonderful or even a must see.  I own this (I bought it before actually watching it because I love Kate Hudson...did I say that yet?) but it is not a film that I gather around to watch on a regular basis.  There are far better films that follow this same formula out there, so I'd recommend one of those before this one.  That said; this is still entertaining and, if you happen to catch it I can honestly say that you won't regret it.",1224115200,2,3165,4.510526315789473
1519599,1,B00005JN3W,"A previous reviewer noted that the deceased sister wished to teach Helen 'a lesson in parenting.'

This idea has stuck with me because of the unspoken corellary that a young footloose sucessful career woman NEEDS to have a 'lesson in parenting' because being a mother is the be all and end all for ALL women.
The assumption is that all women need and want children, and will have them, and that all of us who do NOT are just fooling ourselves and need a sitcom-like twist to show us the error of our ways.
Why does Helen 'need' a lesson in parenting if the unspoken assumption is NOT that she needs and wants (or will need and want) to have children, merely by virtue of being a woman?

I have seen synopsises of this movie which say that Helen is 'forced to grow up'.
Gee - having a high paced career that you love, being financially independant and responsible, owning your own place, having your own money, paying all your bills on time - NONE of those things means that a woman is a 'grown up'. NO! The only way a woman could POSSIBLY be an adult is if she is maternal and has children. Everything else is just dress up.

1519602,4,B00005JN3W,"I was laid up with the flu and not in the mood for serious thinking so I selected this obviously lightweight romantic comedy mostly for the cast.  I love Kate Hudson and John Corbett.  When I realized it was directed by Garry Marshall I got a little depressed as I find his movies so formulaic and superficial that I feared for the worst.

However the story was really not so bad and the cast is quite wonderful.  Hudson, like her famous mother, lights up every frame she's in and that alone was medicine for my flu.  John Corbett who I fell in love with in Northern Exposure was a bit of a disappointment.  Maybe it was his hair--it looked thin and dyed.  Or maybe he felt hamstrung by trying to play a ""sexy man of God.""  I winced at that line.  However he holds his own and Hudson has enough charm and energy for two.  Joan Cusack is very good as the uptight older sister, whom we're supposed to dislike.  In the end each sister gets a bit of the other's traits and everyone seems to live happilly ever after.

The supporting cast is excellent, too.  Helen Mirren, previewing Meryl Streep as the head of a modelling agency, is never bad.  The fellow who plays the used car salesman is wonderful.  The children are all good, which is not always the case in these Hollywood films.  Abigail Breslin is so natural that you just want to hug her.  Her brother is quite good, too.  I especially enjoyed the Indian neighbor who chased the teenagers out of Hudson's apartment with a baseball bat, scolding them for having baggy pants!

Like several others, I wish that Kate Hudson would play some more serious roles that expand her talent.  Perhaps being so adorable is a trap as she is so good at it that she keeps getting these roles.

I found the ""extras"" featuring out takes hosted by Garry Marshal interesting in the sense that it really shows his heart.  He's a nice man, who wants people to be happy.  He even wanted to leave in a scene featuring a daycare center at the workplace because he believes in the concept.  It gave me a new respect for him. Also he's an old pro.  He knows how to put a film together for popular consumption and he did it.

If you're looking for Bergman, as another reviewer here was, you'll have plenty of reason to complain.  But if you take the film for what it is intended to be--a light entertainment with some good themes, then you'll probably enjoy it.",1207440000,2,2387,4.4027459954233406

It's got to be even worse for people who inherit their kids from a family member.

Helen (Katie Holmes) was the go-to girl at her modeling agency if you wanted a model placed at a popular club or a table at a fabulous restaurant.  She had it all--a glamorous life in New York City, a great apartment, a fab job--and she was even dating a Ralph Lauren underwear model.

That is, until her sister died and left her three children with her.  Helen did have a choice.  She could cede the kids to her older sister, Jenny (Joan Cusack) who'd raised her after their mother died.  But her sister chose her first so she had to try.

The chemistry wasn't present between the two main characters and Kate's ""I'm so cute"" persona just made us squirm. The children were much better... and we believe the real star power of this movie was Joan Cusack. Go Joan!

Directed by Garry Marshall, this heartfelt tale of a busy career-woman who unexpectedly has to take on the responsiblity of raising her recently deceased sister's three cute children. This movie is somewhat similiar to Baby Boom but Raising Helen is different in many ways. Some touching moments from Hudson and Joan Cusack.

I think my favorite line in the movie is the line delivered by Jenny (Joan Cusack) in response to Audrey (Hayden Panettiere) when she and Helen find Audry in a hotel room with her boyfriend.  Audry declares, ""YOu just ruined my life!"", and Jenny replies, ""Well, we'll fix it later.  Get in the car.""

The writers could have done a bit more research regarding the character of Rev. Dan Parker.  If nothing else, whoever heard of a Lutheran anything named ""St. Barbara's""?  For that matter, IS there a St. Barbara?  One gets the sense that the screenwriters wanted a priest, but couldn't use one because priests can't marry, so they assumed that the Lutheran faith is 'Catholic Lite' -- same basic idea but with marriable priests.  While most people might not really notice, I did and it made the movie somewhat laughable.  Not *amusing*.  Laughable.  In a sad, 'Surely if you're going to write a Lutheran into your story and make his religion relevant to the plot, you'd do a LITTLE research first"" sort of way.

Oh, and Lutheran preachers are pastors, not priests.  Sheesh.

1519673,4,B00005JN3W,"Helen Harris (Kate Hudson) is a 20-something-year-old woman who's living the high life in New York City. She has a glamorous job at a modeling agency and enjoys clubbing with her friends and dating hot guys. However, when her sister and brother-in-law are killed in a car accident, Helen finds herself the newly-appointed guardian of her two nieces and nephew.

Obviously, raising three children results in some pretty drastic changes to Helen's lifestyle. Her Manhattan apartment isn't big enough for four people, and the only place Helen can afford is an apartment in Queens. Also, Helen's boss (Helen Mirren) isn't very understanding when the children disrupt a fashion show and deface a popular model with permanent markers, so Helen loses her job and has to settle for working at a used (excuse me...PREVIOUSLY OWNED) car dealership. It's nearly impossible for Helen to maintain any kind of social life with three kids at home, but she does form an unlikely relationship with Pastor Dan (John Corbett), the principal of the kids' school. In addition to all that, there are all the usual stresses that come along with being a mom which Helen has never experienced before. The three kids (Hayden Panettiere, Spencer Breslin, and Abigail Breslin) are all adjusting to life without their parents and life with their crazy Aunt Helen, so it's a big adjustment for everyone involved. Plus, Helen's older sister Jenny (Joan Cusack) is miffed that she wasn't asked to serve as guardian of the kids, and she usually doesn't make Helen feel very good about herself.

This is a really cute movie that is also very bittersweet and sentimental. We see the way the deaths of two people profoundly affect every member of their family. The kids all start acting out in their own way, and both sisters are also coping with their grief and adjusting to a new way of doing things. Hudson delivers an excellent performance as a woman who struggles to accept the changes to her life that go along with being a mother, but ultimately realizes that the sacrifices are nothing compared to the joy she experiences when she spends time with the kids.

""Raising Helen"" is pretty predictable in places, but it boasts an outstanding cast and a sweet story about a girl who finally learns how to grow up and raise a family. (I could have done without all the Paris Hilton cameos, but whatever.) This is a fun movie that I definitely recommend.",1150502400,7,2418,4.849878934624697
1519674,3,B00005JN3W,"Yes, whatever you see in `Raising Helen,' you have seen before. It's a feel-good film directed by Garry Marshall of `Pretty Woman' and it stars Kate Hudson as titular working lady Helen in `frivolous' fashion industry in New York. Now for the most unbelievable reasons, Helen inherits custody of three children. What follows after that is nothing new or original to us; the film's script is terribly uneven and sometimes a little shallow, but is still occasionally very funny thanks to the unanimously good performances.

As I said, it's all about Helen's choice between two ways of life: career or children. Helen Mirren as slightly cynical executive of Helen's top modeling agency represents the former lifestyle while the three lovable but sometimes annoying kids embodies the latter. Helen's initial attempt to have both ways would, as you can expect, backfire awfully.

So is `Raising Helen' funny? Yes, it is (wait for Hector Elizondo as used car shop owner). But is it good? Well, it depends because the film's most attractive part is not about the motherhood theme. The film's weak script (or maybe the director himself) cannot decide the right tone to depict this potentially serious issue. At times Garry Marshall seems not to take it very seriously, trying not to make the key sequences of the film too serious while we are all aware that during the sequence the characters are talking (or quarrelling) about a weighty thing. That's why I said `shallow' because we all know that parents will never discuss serious matters like custody of their own children referring to the 70s techno pop band even half-jokingly, but they do in Garry Marshall's film, which weakens the emotional impact of the film.

For all the film's uneven screenplay, and its mawkish moments and familiar factors, the natural charisma of Kate Hudson as Helen, and John Corbett as Pastor Dan Parker, Helen's love interest, and Joan Cusack as Jenny, Helen's more serious and uptight sister, makes the whole film all in all entertaining. The three kids - Hayden Panettiere, Spencer Breslin, and very cute Abigail Breslin are all adorable and credible, and uncredited Hector Elizondo, Garry Marshall regular, appears briefly to provide several amusing scenes.

If `Raising Helen' is not a total failure, it is because of some delightful sequences and good comic performances in it, which make us smile a lot. But even they cannot make us forget the deep flaws in the story and the direction.",1144972800,5,2469,5.014634146341463

When the fun-loving parents are killed in an accident, the kids are left to...Helen (Kate Hudson) instead of the dour sister with kids. This is the story - how she copes/doesn't cope, how the kids react, how she learns to weigh family, friends, job & find romance in the end.

She (of course) must quit her high-paying job, move to Queens, get a new job (used car sales) & meet Dan, a sexy Lutheran pastor who runs the school where the children attend. The usual chaos ensues along with child-rearing angst (the part we parents love) until an expected happy resolution.  Yes, it is trite and totally predictable and soapy and yet it is better than 90% of what is offered today in movie houses.

1519677,2,B00005JN3W,"Typically a movie like this tells the story of a character who thought that the world worked one way, but then is thrown into a circumstance where the old idea doesn't work.  In a leap of faith, the character changes his or her worldview and solves the problem.

This did not happen in Raising Helen.  One would have expected a movie where Helen, a young fast-rising, woman in the modelling industry in New York, resists the responsibiblities of parenting until the end of the movie.  Perhaps she spends too much money, acts as a poor role model, or ignores her charges.

None of this happens.  Helen is forced to raise her nieces and nephews and does very well unders the circumstances.  She moves to a cheaper apartment, gets a new job in a used-car place, and keeps the kids well-fed and cared for.  She deals with rebellious teenagers poorly, but not terribly.  Then for some unclear reason she gives up the kids for 10 minutes and then gets them back.

So what?  The movie had no meat, no passion.  Helen's relationship with Pastor Dan is sterile and insipid.  Her conflict with her sister could have reached ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" proportions but it doesn't.  The children could have acted out and been unraisable because they lost their parent, but they don't.

The problem is that Helen's life is not suited for children.  She has a job with one of Manhattens top modelling agencies Dominique (owner played by Helen Mirren) and she's busy promoting her latest model Tinka (Shakara Ledard) that she feels her sister, the already very motherly Jenny (Joan Cusack in the best role of the film) would be better suited to raise the children...but after reading a letter addressing why she felt it best her children be raised by Helen she agrees.  It's difficult, with every obsticle before her with being a young, first time parent, but she has the help of Pastor Dan (John Corbett) and her neighbor Nilma (the hilarious Sakina Jaffrey)...SO while the film is not perfect it's sweet and cute and is clean for the whole family so it's worth a watch.

1519679,2,B00005JN3W,"""Raising Helen"" is a formulaic romantic comedy that makes you wonder when Kate Hudson will again find a role that will actually allow her to stretch herself as an actress, fulfilling the promise she made half a decade ago in ""Almost Famous.""  Since then it's been mostly downhill for Hudson, and the ironically titled ""Raising Helen"" does nothing to help arrest or reverse that slide.

Hudson plays Helen Harris, a young woman whose budding career in the fashion industry is suddenly cut short when her sister and brother-in-law are killed in a car accident, leaving Helen to raise their three children.  Things go from bad to worse, as the once carefree Helen struggles with the trials and tribulations and life-changing vicissitudes of unplanned motherhood.

This is a typical Garry Marshall film in that, even when it tries to deal with ""real world"" issues such as death, loss, grief, sibling rivalry, teenage angst etc., it does so in only the most superficial, glossy and unconvincing of terms.  Heck, there's even a hunky, hockey-playing Lutheran minister on hand - the kind one can only find in movies - to provide spiritual as well as romantic comfort for those times when the going gets to be just a bit too tough for the harried guardian.

The performances are uniformly uninteresting, but I choose to blame the shallow writing rather than the actors in this case.  It's particularly painful to see actresses of the caliber of Felicity Huffman and Joan Cusack cast adrift in this sea of ""chick flick"" platitudes and feel-good movie cliches - but everyone in this film suffers a similar fate.",1137456000,2,1601,4.907407407407407
1519680,2,B00005JN3W,"I spent an unhealthy amount of time during the '70s and '80s sitting through more than my share of fair-to-middling Goldie Hawn movies. Now, several years removed, Kate Hudson picks up the gauntlet and gamely continues her mother's quest for a decent script.

Hudson (whose resemblance to Goldie is positively eerie) certainly possesses a winning personality. But her struggle to find a vehicle that properly showcases her talent is becoming a bit of a strain on moviegoers who desperately want to like her but aren't being offered a good enough reason to do so. (How long can anyone expect to coast on the goodwill generated by ALMOST FAMOUS?)

In the monumentally contrived RAISING HELEN, Kate finds herself the official guardian of two nieces and a nephew after a sister and brother-in-law are killed in an automobile accident. (The movie is being hyped as a feel-good family film, but can you imagine the trauma inflicted on a young viewer who's lost one or both parents? Thank you, Hollywood, for being so compassionate.) What follows is an allegedly heartwarming account of how the irresponsible-but-lovable Kate gets her act together and gives those kids a reason to smile again, dammit. But we've seen it all before-at least I have, in an era when Goldie Hawn's star sank under the weight of clichd scenarios.

1519741,3,B00005JN3W,"Although pleasant and enjoyable: even charming at times, ""Raising Helen"" could benefit from serious trimming. Less would be better in her romantic adventures with the hockey playing pastor. It could also have benefited from better audio and a little more setting up before the car accident-the reasons for the deceased sister's decision to appoint Helen (who was a younger version of herself) as her children's guardian is one of the three coolest things about this movie and should have been set up better. Hint: it was because the sister had discovered that it isn't adults who create children; it's children who create adults.

The second cool thing is the scene where the three children are sitting together in the closet after the funeral. And the coolest thing is the first shoelace tying scene with little Abigail Breslin. That scene was done perfectly and will probably be the only thing I will think of whenever ""Raising Helen"" is mentioned. Abigail can do ""serious"" better than any actor/actress her age. Her real life brother, Spencer, was fine but once the director had cast him they should have modified his part and replaced all basketball references with something for which he is more physically cast.

I never even knew that Kate Hudson existed before seeing this movie; I probably have had her confused with Katie Holmes. Nothing I saw here will cause me to either seek out or to avoid her movies in the future.

My guess is the real target audience is teenage girls, who can relate to Helen's nightclub adventures and Audrey's coming of age stuff. Hayden Panettiere has grown up very nicely and is well cast as every parent's nightmare ""too hot for her own good"" teenage daughter.

The obvious comparison for ""Raising Helen"" is the more ambitious ""Uptown Girls"", viewers who enjoyed one will probably enjoy the other.

1519748,3,B00005JN3W,"As always, she acts like a complete & utter goofball, including in the bloopers, introducing herself as Kate Hudson instead of Helen whatever her surname was, which was hilarious!

I'm fairly getting into these Garry Marshall movies, particularly as the same two actors always seem to appear - Hector Elizondo, and the other guy, who's name I never seem to be able to figure, or be able to place him either! (Larry Millar -  finally!)

Was it just me or did anyone else notice how alike Kate Hudson & Hayden Panettiere (who played Audrey) looked? Hayden's hair was nearly always in the same curly style as Kate's, and I'm wondering if this was a deliberate choice to make the two actresses look so similar.

This film isn't as fluffy as some of Garry Marshall's other movies, it's a much more serious movie, and very dramatic at times. One problem with this movie is it's too long, and really begins to drag at points, even resorting to the age old cliche of a montage of little scenes, with some corny music over the top. This film isn't in the least bit original. You have your hotshot person enjoying ngihts out, who soon realises there are more important things than parties with supermodels, night clubs, fancy restaurants and great apartments. We have the cute kid, the rebellious girl taking on authority, the sidekick neighbor needed for comic relief, the love interest who thinks he's funny (played by the overrated John Corbett) and the responsible sibling, played brilliant Joan Cusack.

And you'll never guess who also appears in this. She never speaks, just stands around with her hair extensions, and that little dog of hers. (Can you guess who it is yet?) Only Paris Hilton! She only appears briefly in it for a few scenes. I wonder how much she got paid for that!

While filming, director Garry Marshall kept referring to star Kate Hudson as Goldie. He had worked with Hudson's mother Goldie Hawn on Overboard and kept getting the name wrong, as he said they looked and acted so much alike. The actress was a good sport about it, but the crew put up a box for Marshall to pay $5.00 for every time he called her by the wrong name. By the end of the shoot the money in the box provided for a lavish party, thrown by Kate for the entire crew.

If you look carefully, this film was actually shot on the same streets as Spiderman! It's quite cool!

There's lots of teen issues in it, particularly since Hayden plays a bit of a tearaway, and gets caught in a motel room (how overrated) after going to the prom with a bad-boy senior (how even more overrated!) There's also underage drinking, possible drugs (although it's never shown), and all the usual teen stuff.

The finale will have you a bit teary, but it's wrapped up well, if not just a little predictable. I can see Hayden becoming a right little star, if recent photos of her are anything to come by! And she's only 15 or so! It's your typical chick flick, with nothing special, but still quite cool at the same time.",1114473600,5,2986,4.566355140186916

Helen has a great job when her sister dies and leaves her with the kids and not her ""responsible"" sister who has children.  Which shocks the whole family.  Helen tries to hold her great job and raise the kids but it doesn't work, she has to chose between the life she used to lead and the life she is going to need to lead.

What's the plot?
A husband and wife pass away quickly as the movie starts. The woman's wish was that one of her sisters, Helen, take care of her three children. The conflict is in that Helen, now in charge, is the least likely of the two sisters. Other sister Jenny is much better at parenting, and has the goods to show for it. No argues this point, but this fact hardly changes how difficult this will make all lives involved.

What's the value?
When considering who should rear her children should she die, Helen's late sister looked at Jenny, her very motherly sister, with a brood of her own, and Helen, the fun-loving young woman. As she chose, she taught both sisters a lesson in parenting, and provided that her children, in the end, would be better off than had Jenny taken them as her own.

It is entertaining enough to watch, but stereotypical scenes and caricatured fashion designers, and a little too secular Lutheran priest (Pastor Dan) all take away from the reality of it all. It is rarely creative, but it is never terrible.

Pastor Dan (John Corbett) successfully show clergy are people too, but he does so at the cost of not being particularly spiritual.

Kate Hudson is adequate as the single girl Helen, but she could have been interchanged easily with Meg Ryan or a younger Daryl Hannah, or even Sandra Bullock. There is little special about Hudson here. Andi McDowell might have been a richer casting choice, providing more depth to Helen's character.

See the movie. You can let your children watch. Just don't go out of your way to do so.

1519804,2,B00005JN3W,"This movie is really pretty bad on quite a few levels.  It deals with a wreckless, crazy, party/career girl suddenly faced with raising three childred because her (apparently insane) sister ""willed"" the kids to the party girl instead of her uptight but reliable other sister.  We're supposed to find this plausible.  We do not.  However, let's suppose we suspend that disbelief (surely it's no harder to do than believing Jennifer Garner could go from 13 to 30 in an instant...a far superior movie, by the way).  We are nonetheless faced with a family that has lost not only its mother, but its father as well, in one horrible accident (funny, huh?)  The kids do grapple with the grief a little bit, but most get over it pretty quickly so the movie can go back to being cute.  I couldn't help but keep thinking of the horror these kids were enduring...losing both parents and having to move into a smaller abode in a city they DON'T know with an aunt they barely know.  Didn't seem to bother them.

Kate Hudson, the cooky sister, gets the kids into a private, parochial school, headed by Paster John Corbett (late of MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING).  Corbett is a fair enough actor and has charm, but we're supposed to believe that a man of the cloth who has dedicated his career to the church, would be interested in a non-believer, non-church goer like Hudson without having one tiny concern that if they became a couple, it would NOT look good for him in his congregation.  But then again, aside from blessing some animals at a zoo, his religion is pretty much confined to the white collar around his neck.

When I say the movie is dishonest, that's why.  It doesn't honestly portray the way people would behave.  Many movies do this, but this movie wants us to believe it's making a statement about the power of love, our ability to change and grow, etc. etc.  Bull!

The movie gets one star, except for the presence of the always outstanding Joan Cusack.  We're used to her being a uptight, crazy character (SCHOOL OF ROCK jumps right to mind) but here she plays a tightly wound mother, who ought to be a big pain in the rear, but actually shows how motherhood wrenches sacrifices from us and how we make those sacrifices willingly.  We see the idea that you aren't supposed to be the best friends of your kids...you're supposed to be their parents.  Cusack is a totally believable mother.  She acts the role with great specificity and invests her acting with more talent than much of the rest of the cast combined.

Of course, most people want to see this for the ""charm"" of Kate Hudson.  Well, she's almost worn out her welcome.  Like most others, I was captivated by her in ALMOST FAMOUS.  I forgave her for being in HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS (or whatever it was called) because she still was fresh and charming.  But in LE DIVORCE, the reprehensibly boring ALEX & EMMA and now RAISING HELEN, her charm (which never seems to vary) has worn out its welcome.  She might have some talent, but she badly needs a role to show some more sides of her character.

PS:  Helen Mirren and Felicity Huffman are two more terrific actresses who appear in small roles, presumably for nice sized paychecks.  Fans of them will have little to rejoice over here.",1104710400,3,3248,4.542168674698795
1519805,2,B00005JN3W,"It's hard to say where the problem lies with this movie -- the writing, the EDITING, the acting, the casting, the EDITING, the directing, the EDITING...did I mention that the scenes that would have made sense of the story were apparently edited out?

Example: there's a discussion of a house that's been left in trust -- including discussion of large mortgage -- but no mention after that conversation of what has been done with said house.  Helen (left to raise her sister's 3 children) can't afford to rent a place big enough for all of them (heaven forbid she should leave NYC and live in the NJ house like half the people employed in NYC do) but when she puts the children into private school, doesn't even discuss the cost of tuition and assures the principal that she'll be able to cover it.  HUH?  If she's got that kind of money, why doesn't she spend it renting a larger apartment?  And if she kept the house in NJ, she could save money on private school tuition (surely enough to pay the mortgage?) and send the kids to public school.  Then there's a scene where Helen's romantic interest (the school's principal, creating some ethical boundary issues that are ignored) agrees to meet her someplace.  We see Helen and her sister at the meeting place, but the next place we see the principal is back at the apartment.  What was the point of having him say he'd meet her there and then not having him at the meeting place?

Finally, I thought Helen was an idiot (although very pretty).  I couldn't imagine someone whose sister had just died much caring if she could still fit into a size 2.  And her general wussiness was irritating -- hard to imagine how she'd survive in the business world with so little backbone.

I'm probably going to make the people who liked this film angry with this review, but be warned -- this is a very silly movie with a not very appealing lead (unless you like a pretty face and a size 2 bod).",1104537600,4,1932,4.488571428571428

Plot in snapshot: There once were three sisters. The eldest and youngest share a devil-may-care attitude envied and misunderstood by the middle sister. Youngest sister is Manhattan fashionista with size-2 anorexia and condoms in the bedside table. Eldest sister and husband die and SURPRISE! leave her three children to be raised by the sister in the studio apartment, not by the suburban floral-mom-on-roids. Challenges erupt for the new family, who begin to bond with the help of a hornball-with-a-heart-of gold preacher. New head of family gives up, then sees the light and is ""raised."" Halleluia.

The movie is just long enough for me to conclude that Kate Hudson, in the eponymous role, is a technically better actress than her mother, but lacks in the je-ne-se-blah-blah that made her mother famous. She smiles, she pouts, she twirls and cries when necessary, but never quite hits a depth of soul that convinces me those kids are better off with her.

John Corbet's ""sexy man of god"" has me thinking of Lutherans in ways never evoked by Garrison Keeler. As an actor, he's obviously taking advantage of his recent success as a sensitive love-interest in ""Greek Wedding"" and ""Sex in the City"" (since let's face it, he did not convince as a caste-loving real-estate developer in ""Volcano""). But he cannot make this character real, as much as I want to believe that a sexy, sensitive minister has been deflecting female attention all these years just waiting for a ditsy, shallow hottie with an attitude problem and a penchant for bad lying.

Felicity Huffman is wasted in the minimalist dead beatific sister role. Joan Cusack, whom I adore, takes her part a touch too far - she has a hard time not making the Type-A ""spent my youth raising your ditsy, shallow hottie ass"" part a caricature. Her emoting made it difficult for me to empathize with her through most of the film.

However, back to the sex toy party.

1519810,3,B00005JN3W,"I recommend buying the movie Raising Helen. The reason I recommend this movie is because it is funny and will make the audience laugh, it will also make the audience cry many times. Last reason, is that it teaches a very important lesson; you don't realize what you have until it is gone. At the birthday party, Helen gave her sister her gift and asked her ""if she remembered the moves to ""Whip it Good.""

 Raising Helen made me laugh many times. For example, while Helen and her family are dancing to ""Whip it Good,"" they had fire hydrant hats on their heads at the sister's birthday party. The two younger sisters, dancing and singing to the song ""Whip it Good."" Another example is when Helen threw a birthday party for a stuff hippo. It was hilarious seeing the waiter rapping the Happy Birthday song, not many adults would do that to make a little girl happy. Finally, when the teenage niece threw a party at their house, while Helen was gone, Helen had the neighbor chase the kids out with a baseball bat. What was comical was the neighbor was a little lady who was threatening big guys. Not only is Raising Helen funny, it has sad moments.

 In the movie it will also makes the audience cry many times. For example, when the audience finds out that the parents had died in a car accident, Helen and the kids climbed into the closet and talked about their parents. Another time the little boy went every basketball practice and game but couldn't play. Helen went to the coach and demanded to no why he didn't get playing time. The coach responded he refuses to play. When Helen asked the boy why he didn't play he said it was because his dad could no longer play with him.

 This movie teaches the audience a valuable lesson that ""you don't know what you have till it is gone."" For example, when Helen gave up custody, due to her feeling of parental failure, to her sister and realizes she can not turn back time before she had children. Helen didn't know how to change from being a friend to parent.

 These reasons are why I recommend Raising Helen. It will make the audience laugh many times and if you enjoy as I do, a good tear jerker. The last reason is that you don't know what you have till it is gone. When I watch a movie, I like to know that you're going to learn a valuable lesson.",1102291200,4,2298,4.365339578454333
1519811,3,B00005JN3W,"A movie that can put together Kate Hudson, Joan Cusack and Felicity Huffman as sisters is off to a good start, especially when you throw in John Corbett as the love interest along with Helen Mirren as the bad boss and Hector Elizondo as the good boss.  But between the story by Patrick J. Clifton (""Son in Law"") & Beth Rigazio and the script by Jack Amiel & Michael Begler (both for ""The Prince and Me"") what we end up with in ""Raising Helen"" is a formulaic film that never really tries to do anything different.  Sadly, this has been pretty standard for Garry Marshall's recent movies.

Helen Harris (Hudson) is the youngest sister, a free spirit who works as the top assistant to the fashion model super agent, Dominique (Mirren).  Jenny Portman (Cusack) is the middle sister, pregnant with her third child and a stickler when it comes to motherhood.  The oldest sister, Lindsay Davis (Huffman), already has the three kids, and still finds it fun to have everybody dance to Devo's ""Whip It"" (while wearing the hats).  You would think this would make Lindsay the sister in the middle, but this is not the case and eventually we find out there is a reason why these women are the way they are, a pretty important reason, one in which history can be said to be repeating itself in this film, but not one that anybody wants to explore for its richness or uniqueness.

As you know from the trailer for this film, Lindsay and her husband are killed in a car accident and while everybody expects custody of the Davis kids to go to Jenny, Helen is the surprise pick (I was going to say it had to be that way because otherwise there would not be a movie, but it suddenly occurs to me that there IS a movie going in the other direction and it could have been a much better movie than this one).  Lindsay has left behind a pair of letters, one to each sister, explaining the decision, but those do not come into play for a while.  That is because ""Raising Helen"" has to go through the steps of the formula here.

The premise is that Helen knows nothing about raising children and therefore is not fit to be a good mother, but in their time of grief she knows how to be compassionate while Jenny is concerned with being proper.  The problem is not Helen, but her job, which requires her to work nights and other times when mommy duties are required, and it is just a matter of time until Helen gets cut loose.  By that time she has moved into a new apartment in Queens to accommodate her instant family and enrolled the children in a Lutheran School run by the handsome Pastor Dan (Corbett).  Helen's biggest flaw is not that she does not know how to be a mom, but that she apparently does not know of any theological differences between Lutherans and Catholics (or pastors and priests for that matter).

Helen's problem is that she needs to find a new job, while each of the kids has their own problem.  Audrey (Hayden Panettiere), who had showed her fake ID to a proud Aunt Helen, is smitten with the bad boy at the school.  Henry (Spencer Breslin) is on the school basketball team but does not want to play or even practice.  Sarah (Abigail Breslin) gets upset trying to tie her schools and is waiting for her stuffed animal's parents to come back.  Helen solves most of these problems, but the one she does not solve becomes the straw that breaks the camel's back.

Another point on the plus side is that Helen does get a job, as a receptionist for Mickey Massey (Elizondo), who runs a pre-owned car lot.  A running gag is that Massey is trying to film a commercial for his business and they never quite work.  You would think that Helen has found a home and will help Massey with his commercials, but you would be wrong.  She does something else instead, and even that does not lead to anything.  Now, my wife has been working as a finance officer at car dealerships for several years now and every place she has been at could have benefited from listening to her because she is smart as well as good looking, but they never do.  So I was hoping that Helen would be able to do something intelligent along those lines, but that is apparently not part of the formula.  But I have bigger complaints.

When we get to the big crisis in the movie the formula demands that Helen fail.  But she should not have because you do not have to be a mother to know what mistake Audrey is making, you just have to have been a teenage girl at some point in your life.  When Audrey declares that her life is being ruined by the action of her aunt, there are a whole bunch of obvious rejoinders that would have put her in her place.  Then there is the bit with the credit card, which is used as a convenient plot device, but which is totally ignored in terms of being part of the resolution for the scene (how would Audrey feel if she learned it was now in the kid's wallet?).  The formula overrides the opportunities to do something different that would make this movie work.

For me the final nail in the coffin is when we finally get to find out about the second letter.  This is partly because I had my own idea as to what the letter said and I like it better than what they came up (my idea was that the kids were given to Helen as much for her sake as for that of the kids).  But it is also because this movie really wants to reduce the pivotal character of Jenny to a mere caricature who has to be the ""villain.""  When you learn the story of what happened to the mother of Helen, Jenny and Lindsay, it really throws all of the relationships between the characters into doubt (I can understand how it would have turned Jenny into who she was, but how would Helen have ended up like this?).

There is nothing wrong with the performances of any of the cast except for Cusak, and that is simply because of how badly written her character is for most of the film.  One of the great supporting actresses of her generation, Cusak does overcome the limitations of her material towards the end of the film.  But overall ""Raising Helen"" ignores all of the opportunities the storyline offers to just do it by the numbers.  It was sad to see Marshall waste his good luck charm Eliozondo like this, and painful to watch the romance between Helen and Pastor Dan just spin its wheels for no good reason.  This movie is still two rewrites away from being really good or at least having some memorable scenes despite the formula (it can be done: ""The Family Man"" is on television right now, proving the point).",1102204800,4,6476,4.369474562135113

Joan Cusack and Felicity Huffman are the older, married, more responsible sisters of Fast-Track Manhattanite Kate Hudson as Helen.  When Felicity and her husband are tragically killed we discover that their children have been left to.... young and single Helen rather than Cusack's more maternal Jenny.

In many scenes we seem to be close to the same neighborhoods that we saw in ""In America"" but in that movie we saw many obstacles placed before our protagonist family without obvious solutions.  In ""Raising Helen"" the screenplay tosses obstacles in front of Helen and her orphaned nephew and nieces, but then the screenplay also provides a deux ex machina to resolve the conflict in the next scene.

Helen suddenly needs someone to sit with the two younger kids while the younger one has gone from the Prom to a hotel with a ""bad boy"" - neighbor Nilma is *always* available, not only to take care of the kids, but also to brandish a baseball bat to whack bad boys.  The kids have lost their parents and move from Jersey to New York with Helen and their separation anxiety won't allow them to go to private schools, where the younger kids would be in elementary and the older sister in high school.  The Deux provides a wonderful Lutheran school in the neighborhood where ANYONE can go.  Helen loses her fast-track boyfriends of Manhattan.  The Lutheran school has a handsome sexy Pastor played by John Corbett (who seems to be tossed to a lot of young women in distress since ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"".)

Helen is an intelligent, apparently reasonably educated professional woman, but she mistakenly thinks that a Lutheran Pastor must be celibate and that Pastor Dan wants to abandon his ""vows"" when he asks her out.  I know teenagers educated at poorly-ranked public schools who know that since Martin Luther began the Protestant Reformation 400 years ago that Protestant Ministers have been allowed to marry and more.

When the teenager tells Jenny (Joan Cusack)""I hate you, I will always hate you"", Joan's cool response; ""We'll fix that later was classic a classic example of cool, great parenting.

Thank you Gary Marshall for presenting a pastor as 99% of them are: as a warm, caring person. It was so refreshing to rather than the typical Hollyword character as a felon, a pervert, a cheat, amoral... detestable person.

Being a mom, for instance, is not all about being cuddly and being liked; it's also about being hated for doing the tough-but right-thing.

On a lighter note, Hudson and John Corbett have such a difference in physical stature-he's a sturdy 6'2"" and she is a tiny 5'2""-that they make a very cute couple. You keep hoping that they will get together. He's very sweet, and she's very pretty. What more need be said?",1097798400,2,859,4.758389261744966
