8299144,3,B001EOQV3Q,"30 Salsas Pegaditas, I don't mind Oldies but Goodies, unfortunally they are not that many good ones here! Except for a handful the rest I don't care, whether they are New or Old, and yes they are from the 90's Most videos have Good Image Quality and Sound, and they were not hits and some others I never heard before and they are not that exciting to me, I don't even want them for some sort of Music Library as another reviewer pointed out! and the Information Printed on The DVD BOX is Full of Errors. Some of the Songs in the DVDs Do Not Correspond/Match with the Songs in the Tittle List...Example:

DVD 1  The tittles 1 & 12 are wrong on this Website
Track  1:  Que Hay De Malo By Jerry Rivera...and NOT... Amores Como El Nuestro, also By Jerry Rivera
Track 12:  Me Duele Hasta La Vida By La Organizacion...and NOT...Eres, also By La Organizacion
Track 14:  Me Muero, The Singer is David Angel...and NOT DANIEL as Printed on the Back of the DVD BOX
DVD 2
Track  2:  Is, A Puro Dolor By Son By Four, however Printed on The DVD BOX says: Nuestro Amor Se Ha Vuelto Ayer By Victor Manuelle
Track  4:  Ay Amor Cuando Hablan Las Miradas By Orquesta Guayacan...and NOT...Mis Amores By Jose Alberto El Canario ...So Many Discrepancies!

Music is Very Personal that is the reason why I am giving it a very Generous 3 stars, maybe somebody loves them! To me I like: ""El Flojo"" La Organizacion, ""Persona Ideal"" ""Me Nego"" Orquesta Adolescent's, I think Adolescentes are one of the Best Salsa Groups with Porfi Baloa their Musical Director and Composer, However, I already have most of their Music. I was very disappointed with the Group 3 Son Salsa in the second DVD ""Sombras"" ""El Cuarto De Tula"" ""La Murga De Panama"" and ""Cucala"" All Four Songs are Combined and Reduced into Exactly Four Minutes!

These four Songs are the reason why I ordered the 30 Salsas Pegaditas, I don't have these Videos and I like 3 Son Salsa. I was very Surprised to see that all four Songs are put together as a ""Medley Presentation"" ...YES! Would you believe it? A Sort of Background Music for the Group Members to Express their feelings about their Music! ...and TALK! ...it doesn't say anything on the DVD Package about this Fact and I wish I had known of this Information, Sony Music should have Printed it on The DVD BOX! ...Thank You D.D.",1348531200,,2315,4.459715639810427
8299145,2,B001EOQV3Q,"These are old videos from the early 90's and late 80's... Nothing recent... Ok for video library, but nothing else...",1292889600,,117,4.9
