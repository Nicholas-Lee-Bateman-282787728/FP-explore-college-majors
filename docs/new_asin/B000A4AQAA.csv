2358001,5,B000A4AQAA,"This DVD is wonderful.  I love the music, the bright colors, the puppet, the babies, and the loving adults. It is great fun and is so developmentally approriate for the youngest people in our lives. It helps them to learn important skills by seeing other children their age doing things.  I definitely recommend it.",1126310400,4,315,4.814814814814815
2358002,5,B000A4AQAA,"This DVD is very sweet and helps motivate parents to actually play with their child as they watch.  The colorful set, Eebee, babies, and activities are sure to captivate your little one.  Have fun!",1126224000,7,197,4.764705882352941
2358003,1,B000A4AQAA,"I had high hopes for the DVD, as we love the AHA classes, but the DVD is really rather strange. The ""parent"" is wearing false eyelashes! It might be of use to someone who has no ideas about what to do with a baby, but it is very strained and contrived. Worst of all, my daughter was furious that the scene pictured on the box did not appear in the video.",1126137600,2,354,4.0
2358014,5,B000A4AQAA,"This show is by far the best I've found that engages my baby. I highly recommend doing the activities in the show along with the character to enrich the experience. My daughter loves to dance to the songs and bang on toys along with the show. If anything, it's a good show for a parent to watch to learn how to play with their child. All the activities are appropriate for the age group. Love, love, love Eebee Baby!!",1351036800,,417,4.291139240506329
2358015,5,B000A4AQAA,This is all my 17 month old wants to watch. We could have it on repeat 24/7 and she would be content. She gets so upset when it is over and we refuse to turn it back on. She obviously doesn't understand why she can't watch tv all day.,1347494400,,234,3.795918367346939
2358016,1,B000A4AQAA,"This is the most annoying DVD, ever.  There's not a single idea in it that any mother doesn't instinctively already know.",1331769600,,121,4.761904761904762
2358017,5,B000A4AQAA,"I love Eebee!  This is the perfect DVD to put on to hold my infant's attention while I take a shower or cook dinner.  My 27 month old still asks to watch it, and she started watching it when she was 6 months old.  The songs are catchy and not annoying like some-we sing them in the car when we need to settle down!  I highly recommend this DVD!",1325116800,,344,3.9420289855072466
2358018,5,B000A4AQAA,"My son and I love playing along with Eebee and this DVD. I especially enjoyed the features for parents, which explain the reason for each activity.",1313625600,,147,4.6923076923076925
2358019,1,B000A4AQAA,"I have 2 Baby Einstein DVDs and read reviews that this video was better.  I wish I had purchased another Einstein product instead.  This sounds like a great idea and the puppet is cute.  My son gets excited when the puppets show up on the Einstein DVDs, so I thought he would love this.  This puppet is annoying and makes strange noises.  I guess it is supposed to be ""baby-like"" noises, but they are just weird.  The young girl that plays with the puppet is not enjoyable to watch.  The ideas of how to play with your baby are just common sense things you are probably doing anyway.  This doesn't affect how my baby likes the video, but I am also surprised to see earrings and necklaces on the young babies.  Why?",1271116800,,714,4.348484848484849
2358020,5,B000A4AQAA,"We bought all three of the Eebee DVDs and would recommend them.  Of the three, I'd suggest starting with ""All in a days' play"" if you only get one.  That's the first we bought.

What we liked most about Eebee is it featured only scenes of adults, babies, and Eebee playing different games.  No computer graphics, no cartoons, no dumb jokes that only an adult would get.  You only see things that a child might actually see in real life.  It's a refreshing change to finally find a DVD actually made for children!

My son loves watching it and over time understood what was happening.  We could play the same games in person, and the DVD gave us some great ideas.  The DVD features different children and adults, and they limit Eebee to doing things that any toddler might do.  Our son also watches some Japanese kids shows, as well as some other DVDs made by other companies, but they don't really compare.  They're too abstract, and at times annoying.  Put simply, Eebee keeps it real.

The one thing to note is there is only about 30 minutes of playtime on this DVD, with another 30 minutes of commentary explaining the best way to play the games shown.  That said, when I compared with other DVDs I got like Baby Einstein, they were full of graphics, adverstisements, logos, and filler material (not to mention lots of corny jokes my son doesn't get).  Baby Einstein is hit and miss for us, and in my opinion not really worth it by comparison.  I'd return it if I hadn't got it on sale.  Although we'd like to have seen more footage in Eebee, 30 minutes turns out to be about as much as my son will watch in 1 or 2 sittings anyways.

I eventually bought all three DVDs and emailed the makers encouraging them to make more.  The funny thing was I only found out about these DVDs because my son liked the Eebee plush toy at our local store, then I found out about the DVDs and ordered one off Amazon.  He responded very positively to it around 10 months, although we didn't let him watch regularly until later.",1266451200,3,2011,4.413043478260869
2358021,5,B000A4AQAA,"It is so nice to find a dvd that encourages parents and children to play together.  This is especially helpful for those of us who don't know tons of ""baby"" games.  My daughter loves the music and likes to play along with Eebee.  We also play the games without the dvd.

You do need some props, but I found this really inspirational in terms of ideas for playing with baby!  WAY better than watching your child zone out to a dvd (which kind of freaks me out, to be honest).",1164067200,3,473,4.211111111111111
2358022,5,B000A4AQAA,"My two boys (ages 3 1/2 and 1 ) really enjoyed the DVD.  Both kids even sat still for most of it.  My one-year old seemed to really respond to the actual children in the DVD.  He got very verbal when he saw the kids doing something with the balls or he would bounce up and down in excitement.  My three year old wanted to watch over and over again to see how the balls moved.  He now wants me to go find different tubes and see how the balls work in them.

This DVD was really worth watching!",1127692800,3,492,3.919191919191919
2358023,5,B000A4AQAA,"My 10-month old loved this DVD.  He watched eebee intently and smiled when he watched the children on the video.  Unlike the Baby Einstein series (which is simply a barrage of images) the eebee video actually shows my son how to play with a ball and other items in our home.  During the video, I attempted to recreate the ball play they did and my son responded very well.  I'd rather have my son watch this video and actually learn something than the other video which seems to go nowhere.  I look forward to seeing new eebee DVDs in the future.",1126742400,,546,4.366336633663367
8074305,5,B000A4AQAA,"My daughter loved Eebee's Adventures. I'd recommend all of them. They use to be on Netflix and when they took them off, we were so sad! We tried a few activities we learned from the show and I would say this is better than most shows out there.",1486857600,,244,4.104166666666667
8074306,5,B000A4AQAA,This is a great learning tool for babies and the song is quite catching.,1432684800,,72,4.214285714285714
8074307,5,B000A4AQAA,"I wasn't crazy about it, but my son LOVED it.

My aunt told me that both of her kids ADORED this DVD as babies and since she was done having kids she was ready to pass it along. At the time I received it, my son really didn't like cartoons/tv...just wasn't interested. (Had just turned two) I received  this DVD with the life size Ebee doll and when I got home I just kind of stared at it like.....what in the world is this thing even supposed to be?

We watched the DVD together and he was GLUED to the tv with a huge grin on his face. It was educational, light, and playful. Even shows you some games you can play with your baby.

The only thing I didn't like about it was Ebee. Why couldn't they have used a regular child? The doll creeps my hubbs out he asked me why there were fingers coming out of his head. Fingers is not the comparison he made. but I wanted to clean it up a little. My son HATED the doll until he got a little older.

All in all the product was made for kids, not adults & the kids love it. He's nearly 3 and this is still one of his favorites to watch!",1427932800,,1078,3.9493087557603688
8074308,5,B000A4AQAA,"My 18 month old granddaughter loves the Eebee videos.  Just wish they'd make a hand puppet.  The stuffed animals are sold out on Amazon and elsewhere, scalping on eBay.",1398297600,,168,4.758620689655173
8074309,1,B000A4AQAA,"Fantastic show. However, Amazon's copy is poor quality and glitchy.  Very disappointed with the quality of this versus most other Amazon Prime shows/movies we've watched.",1380672000,,170,5.8
8074310,4,B000A4AQAA,"Eebee is not exactly my choice of a movie.  But, my daughter loves watching him.  I was surprised that it actually captured her attention for 2/3rds of the movie.",1379116800,,162,4.551724137931035
8074311,4,B000A4AQAA,"Baby loves watching this, he drops everything he's doing to watch. Good for calming him down or keeping him occupied. However, we live in a digital high-definition age, and the video seems somewhat on the standard-def side of things, I had bought some videos directly from the eebee website, and they were frighteningly low-definition, almost amateurish quality, and bought this (more expensive) version on Amazon. Well, it's definitely a little bit better, but I find myself continuing to search for a high-res version, one that will actually look great playing back on my Retina iPad.

I don't think baby cares that it's not high-def, though.",1367280000,,644,5.133333333333334
8074312,4,B000A4AQAA,"My son loves watching the soft, gentle play in this video and seeing real kids doing fun stuff! He watching it over and over! Older kids might be bored, but for early toddlers it is great!",1366156800,,188,4.25
8074313,5,B000A4AQAA,"The eebee series is fantastic! My toddler loves them so much, and it provides a few necessary minutes a day when he will sit still! I highly recommend these movies!

The songs and activities are educational and enjoyable!",1364083200,,221,4.815789473684211
