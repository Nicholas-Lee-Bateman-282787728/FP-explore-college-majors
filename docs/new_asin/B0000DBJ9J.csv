1921683,4,B0000DBJ9J,"I've been an admirer of the three directors in this DVD series, but when i went through the DVD for Michel Gondry i could not find the RADIOHEAD video for ""Knives Out"". This is a great, trippy video all in ""one"" shot like a couple others. The video i downloaded  off kazaa was crappy quality and i hoped that the DVD version would be crystal clear. I'm pretty sure that he directed it and in the trailer on the internet and Chris Cunningham showed clips it in it. Does anyone know if it's on there or what's up with that? Otherwise, this is a great DVD.",1067644800,5,553,4.216981132075472
1921684,5,B0000DBJ9J,"As a avid admirer of videos that are both unique and rare I am salivating at the chance to own this and the other two titles (spike jonze & chris cunningham).  It has taken me a many months to find works by these talented people.  The closest you could come to finding a fraction of their work would be to buy Bjork dvd's (which might I recommend are works of arts themselves)  In an age where MTV defines what makes good music videos these 3 men are a breath of fresh air and a slap in the face to all those who claim EMINEM's latest video is ""so creative"".  Other than their own films and videos there are many commercials and short films out there featuring their talents.  Why should a media so unlimited be limited...press play and take these all in.",1064534400,20,755,4.288732394366197
1921695,3,B0000DBJ9J,"Gondry has created some great videos, along with with suffocatingly cute unbearably whimsical work.  Happily, his early work is the most cloying; he has definitely improved with age.  This dvd has some astonishing moments of genius: ""Sugar Water"" by Cibo Matto is particularly impressive.

1921697,5,B0000DBJ9J,"I lent my copy of this DVD to someone and never got it back, so I'll have to buy another one. When people come over for dinner, I always want to show them these five videos:

Come Into My World ~ Kylie Minogue
Let Forever Be ~ The Chemical Brothers
Star Guitar ~ The Chemical Brothers
Around the World ~ Daft Punk
Sugar Water ~ Cibo Matto

1921698,5,B0000DBJ9J,"This DVD is excellent.  It's volume #3 in a series of 7, but is far superior to the others in the series.  Michel Gondry is a very creative, extremely intelligent director, which is made clear in this DVD.  My only problem with it is that everyone always wants to borrow it!",1219708800,,274,4.333333333333333
1921699,4,B0000DBJ9J,"This DVD is part of a bigger set, which I'm sure most of you know, and is a great experience all by itself. Michel Gondry has proven himself to be one of the most creative Directors out there and invents ways to compliment the musical artists with supporting imagery. Some of the older music may be a little different from what you're used to if you are American and didn't listen to music during the times of his early career; however, European's and older viewer's may have just a little more appreciation of the sound. Either way, the imagery is beautiful and the simplistic, yet extremely complex world Michel Gondry creates is of the utmost intrigue.",1211846400,2,655,4.655172413793103

1921701,4,B0000DBJ9J,"This is probably my 2nd favorite dvd like this, really liked all the videos, except for some of the bjorn ones which were obviously pretty weird.  Forgot the name of the singer/song, but the one where it's just beats and the landscape shows stuff following the beat pattern is really cool.  Mark Romanek's dvd is the only one I like better, if you're into these types of dvds I'd strongly suggest getting that one.",1182816000,,414,4.581081081081081

1921703,4,B0000DBJ9J,"this is one amazing director! one of the most visually original around today. the videos in this collection are amazing on the first disk but the second shows the EARLY work of the director that looks and sounds like a junior high stopmotion project. no offense to the director, everyone has to start somewhere, right!?

this is an excellent collection of great videos whether you are a fan of the artists or not.",1154908800,,413,4.657534246575342
1921704,5,B0000DBJ9J,"This collection of Director Michel Gondry's work is nothing short of amazing. It encompasses all of his career, and has just about everything he ever directed, short of including his movie ""Eternal Sunshine"". You'll find some of the best 90s pop songs accompanied by bizarrely upbeat videos. Well worth the money, it will be watched again and again. Something I'll never loan out...",1143072000,,382,5.079365079365079
1921729,3,B0000DBJ9J,"This is a great compilation of his work.  I am not a fan of Bjork at all and there are about 5 or 6 of her music videos on this DVD.

1921730,5,B0000DBJ9J,"...It's not true though.  Michel Gondry is more than just talented, and even his humble creative beginnings display an almost obsessive compulsion to create and invent astounding new film techniques.

Michel Gondry has made some of the most beautiful and innovative music videos ever.  He provides a staggering volume of work here(of somewhat mixed quality), far more than the other 2 DVD's in this series.  The great ones are amazing..but there is some filler.

The added documentary also provides great insite into the methods and experiences that helped shape his vision as a director.  Must have for anyone who likes anything.",1115942400,,630,5.188118811881188
1921731,5,B0000DBJ9J,"Seriously, stop reading and buy this. Its amazing.

I have been a long-time, committed hater of music videos. So many of my favourite songs have been tarnished (or worse) by videos that give us three pointless, wasted, did I say pointless already? minutes of some lead singer trying to look intense. Or some mini-narrative (unrelated to the song, of course) about how tough it is to fit in at school. Cross-cut with pointless shots of an intense lead singer.

And then there was this DVD. Until the moment that I first saw this at a friend's house, I had no idea that EVERY music video that Ive EVER enjoyed was directed by either Michel Gondry or Spike Jonze. And I also saw about a dozen amazing videos that Id never seen before. I was so happy.

Every video on this compilation is great. No exaggeration. My favourites include ""Dead Leaves"" and ""Fell in Love"" by the Stripes, ""Star Guitar"" by the chemical brothers, everything Daft Punk and, of course, ""Everlong"". Plus, everything else.

I even liked the Kylie Minogue video! Who'd of thought?

Stop reading. Buy This. If necessary, I'll spot you the money.",1113523200,3,1111,4.706185567010309
1921732,5,B0000DBJ9J,"If it's videos you want, you should definitely look into ""The Work of Director Michel Gondry,"" whose eye-opening videos for The White Stripes, Bjrk, The Chemical Brothers, and Kylie Minogue are sure to keep you pushing the Repeat button on your DVD remote. Instead of giving commentary for the videos, Gondry himself puts together a documentary, entitled ""I've Been 12 Forever,"" which features insight from all the musicians and filmmakers involved, as well as interviews with Gondry's family and friends. Watching the two-part documentary, one gets the feeling that they are having a one-on-one conversation with Gondry, as he relates to the camera various dreams he's had all his life and, then, to give us a visual aid, will usually make a short film depicting his dream. Definitely the most generous of the three Director's Label DVDs.",1106524800,,839,5.131386861313868
1921733,5,B0000DBJ9J,I had very little to do with the planning and completion of this DVD so I believe I can give  it a review.  However I don't think I can give it one without bias so everyone can take the my five stars with a pinch of salt.  I can say that I do love the DVD very much.  I feel very happy that it has been recieved so well and feel that it does offer a comprehensive view into my work.  If there were more stars to give I would.,1104364800,96,425,3.6777777777777776

1921735,5,B0000DBJ9J,"Like many other customers I didn't know before that so many of my favourite video clips came from the same director. Wheh I saw Bjork's ""Human Behavior"", Sinead O'Connor's ""Fire on Babylon"" and Radiohead's ""Knives Out"" the first time is was simply a shock of how good musical video can be!

Now Gondry's works are available on this DVD. An excellent purchase; highly recommended.

One big regret - no ""Fire on Babylon"" here. That clip sets the bar very high for the music visualization and deserved to be on any ""Best of"".",1095552000,3,522,4.663043478260869
1921736,5,B0000DBJ9J,"Michel Gondry is an abstract thinker with cutting edged creativity. From his childish ""Human Behavior"" video with Bjork, to his mature and dark ""Dead Leaves and Dirty Ground"" with the White Stripes. Gondry's creations are but a slice of his colorful and creative life. This DVD comes with a book and a postcard. The book includes the inside stories, sketches and photos of Gondry with the likes of Cibo Matto, the Rolling Stones and Bjork. Included in the book are pictures of his son(who is a smaller version of Gondry), brother and various cars his father owned. Missing from the book are the stories behind Massive Attack's ""Protection"" and Cibo Matto's ""Sugar Water"". But, with all that aside, Gondry's video is excellent and full of memorable vids, thoughts and ideas.

In the future I hope to see this series of Director's DVD's expand with the likes of Mark Romaneck and Flora Sisgmondi.",1092614400,,894,4.881578947368421
1921737,5,B0000DBJ9J,Gondry remains an artist ahead of his time.  This fresh and GIGANTIC collection of stellar videos will totally enthral anyone with a pulse.  No home should be without it.,1089072000,,170,4.827586206896552
1921768,4,B0000DBJ9J,"Michel Gondry's massive imagination is full of weirdness and wonder. The director of ""Human Nature"" and the wonderful ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" has a certain kind of cleverness well-suited to music videos. Now the best of them are shown in ""Director's Series Volume 3: The Work of Director Michel Gondry.""
Among his vivid music videos are the White Stripes' ""Dead Leaves & the Dirty Ground,"" ""Fell In Love With A Girl"" and ""Hardest Button to Button,"" and a slew of other respected bands like Massive Attack (""Protection""), the Chemical Brothers (the funhouse mirror ""Let Forever Be""), Daft Punk (colorful ""Around the World"") the Rolling Stones (""Like A Rolling Stone"") and a bunch of videos for the French pop-rock band Oui Oui, for which he played drums. And that's not all of them!
The two part documentary ""I've Been 12 Forever"" includes interviews with Gondry, behind-the-scenes information, and bits and pieces of how he forms his unique visions. There are commercials, all tinged with the strange but immensely effective. And on the short film front, Jim Carrey stars in the cute, immensely amusing ""Pecan Pie,"" but the freakily scatological ""One Day"" falls utterly flat. Wrapping up the whole thing is a booklet full of even more interviews, drawings and inspiration.
Aside from his films, Gondry is perhaps best known for his Bjork music videos, presented in their glory here. The attitudes of the bands and musicians are reflected in the music videos, so the personality shines through, as if Gondry has carefully shaped the images around the music. Nothing is normal here -- whether it's the White Stripes made of Legos, or Jim Carrey riding his bed like a car.
The double-sided disc allows fans to check out the evolution of Gondry's style. He was a lot less sophisticated in his Oui Oui days, but the relatively immature videos he did for those songs were enough to get Bjork asking for him to direct ""Human Behavior."" The rest is musical history. After that, Gondry's style becomes somewhat stranger but no less riveting.
There's plenty of information for those who love Gondry's warmly quirky style, including interviews with the musicians. What it lacks are some of his other prominent music videos, like Radiohead's ""Knives Out."" However, it contains a lot more early material than the other Director Series DVDs. And what it has is quite personal, since Gondry also made the music for the earliest music videos.
With the exception of the occasional dud, ""The Work of Michel Gondry"" is an effervescent trip into a mind where the music video becomes a flexible art form. Vivid and vibrant.",1084492800,6,2618,4.97945205479452
1921769,5,B0000DBJ9J,"Any trace of intelligence on the planet should consider spending spare day to contemplate this.

1921770,5,B0000DBJ9J,"Gondry established himself as one of the most innovative directors out there, and he has the body of work to prove it. This DVD had so many goodies, from short art films to artist interviews that I was blown away. Aspiring directors will get a look into his process and fans will be rewarded with plenty of videos and a shot of his girlfriend streaking!",1080086400,,353,4.446153846153846
1921771,4,B0000DBJ9J,"Michel Gondry is a visionary music video director who presents images that feel like they have sprung right out of fanciful dreams or fevered nightmares. Like feature filmmaker Terry Gilliam, Gondry seamlessly blends reality with dreams so that it is impossible to know where one ends and one begins.
Included with the DVD is a 52-page booklet that features behind-the-scenes photos, interviews with Gondry and several of his written treatments for the music videos he ended up directing.
Several of his short films are included on the DVD. Among them, ""Drumb and Drumber,"" which anticipates the same kind of technique he would perfect on a more ambitious scale with the ""The Hardest Button to Button"" video by The White Stripes.
""Pecan Pie with Jim Carrey"" is a funny short film that involves the actor riding around in a bed in his pajamas. It's a surreal vignette that makes no sense-which is largely its appeal.
The DVD also collects some of Gondry's commercial work, most notably one for Levi's jeans which beautifully captures many of the video director's pre-occupations.
In lieu of audio commentaries for the videos (as on the Spike Jonze DVD) there is a 75-minute documentary about Gondry and his career that is divided into two parts over both sides of the DVD. The second segment is the most interesting because it features interviews with many of the musicians that have had videos directed by Gondry. One of the highlights is when Jack White dryly noting that Gondry's concept for ""Fell In Love With A Girl"" was better then his bandmate, Meg's idea of having them be made out of Oreo cookies.
This DVD perfectly conveys Gondry's unique vision with an excellent cross-section of his work. This disc is highly recommended for fans of the music video medium.",1074038400,5,1768,4.916387959866221
1921772,4,B0000DBJ9J,"The directors in this series (Spike Jonze, Chris Cunningham and Michel Gondry) show that as much brilliance can go into a four minute slice of music video as it can into an entire full-length motion picture.  They also show that music video is at its best when it strays from conventional narrative techniques or the straight-up dull ""live performance"" approach.  Like Jonze, Gondry works best when he follows through on a visual concept: see all the White Stripes videos, Kylie Minogue's ""Come into My World,"" the absolutely insane ""Let Forever Be"" (the Chemical Brothers), and the metatextual Bjork video ""Hyperballad.""  While working with or exploiting 80s digital special effects (""Let Forever Be""), stop-motion photography (White Stripes ""Fell in Love with a Girl), CG effects (Chemical Brothers' ""Star Guitar""), backwards film (Cibo Matto's ""Sugar Water"") or projection (the Stripes' ""Dead Leaves""), Gondry dangerously (at least to the musical performers) makes some of these songs seem quite inferior to his amazing visual product.  The early Oui Oui videos are very informative for the way they show how distinctive Gondry was even during his ""apprenticeship"" phase.  The Bonus material is mixed in quality.  Many of the commercials and shorts are quite uninteresting.  The documentary (I've Been 12 Forever) is very informative, and ""One Day"" (with comedian David Cross), which I cannot really talk about here due to its graphic nature, is so appalling that it is either utterly repulsive or a work of sheer genius.  I haven't figured out which yet!  Worth purchasing for anybody interested in the best that music video has to offer.",1071964800,2,1642,5.236641221374046
1921773,1,B0000DBJ9J,"I love this DVD as much as the next guy, but damn, where is the KNIVES OUT video???????!!!!!!!!!???????? That video is crazy and would be great in DVD quality. All the other videos are great too, but the missing one bums me out. In trailers for this DVD, it said it would have the radiohead viddy in it. WTF?!?!?! The Chris Cunningham DVD is missing a few viddys that look cool too, but i guess, where omitted for some stupid arse reason.  LAME ARSE!",1071532800,6,450,4.357142857142857
1921774,5,B0000DBJ9J,"is it wrong for me to have never remembered the name michel gondry before this dvd came out?
i mean, sure, i'd seen alot of these videos before and loved all of them, but the name never stuck. not like spike jonze. when i saw the promotional trailers for the directors label dvds, i saw all the videos on michel gondry's collection and was completely floored. suddenly, spike jonze became a secondary thought. i NEEDED the michel gondry disc.
now, odds are you already know whether you're going to like the music videos or not (if you have any artistic sense at all, you most likely will like them very much
what may surprise you is that his short films and whatnot are equally interesting and entertaining.

1921776,5,B0000DBJ9J,"Having bought all three of the Palm Pictures directors series. I can say this is the one that will bring you the most enjoyment - not just for the amount of stuff on it (considerably more than the other two) but for the sheer fun and joy of Gondry's work. His videos think way outside the usual square of music video making. My personal favourite is the the Chemical Brothers Let forever be filmclip (the swapping between film and video, interior studio to various exterior/interior video shots is truly startling and too hard to describe). But there is something unique about every clip from use of camera to special effects to use of the beat with visual cues.

All of this coupled with the man and his sense of humour (which is explored not only in the clips but in short films, ads and a two part documentary) make it the best value entertainment buy this year. He has already made a feature (the hugely underrated Human Nature) and has a new one coming out with Jim Carrey (which hopefully lots of people will see). He should be a household name already so get this and see him in all his glory now!!!!

Just an update to this - I have found several videos that were left out (radiohead - knives out, terence trent d'arby - she kissed me, lenny krvitz - believe) also there have been a few new ones come out(steriogram - walkie talkie man, the vines - ride). I would suggest to Mr Gondry and company that a second Work Of DVD be made at some point. Also looking forward to two new features (the science of sleep and the master of time and space) if they are half as good as Eternal Sunshine then we all have lots to look forward to",1069113600,4,1636,4.3431372549019605
