8344370,3,B001KQFA80,"Silambarasan sans his usual mannerisms fits the college student role. Hari has brought out somewhat a natural performance from Simbu. But he will have to improve a lot by way of performance. Sonia Agarwal though looks matured is at ease as a soft-spoken Angel who comes from a staunch Christian family. Vadivel brings in some lighter moments. Nazar, Rajkiran, Rekha, Akash are sufficient. Hari's commencing the movie with the very beginning scene of religious misunderstanding between two sects of people arouses interest. But as the movie proceeds, the screenplay is unpredictably inconsistent and consistently predictable. Dialogues are good at times, but they are only useful in making the things more melodramatic. And as a director, Hari does not live up to the very high standards he set for himself in Saami. Harris Jayaraj is a big disappointment. The music is a rehash of his earlier films KK and Saami. Priyan's camera work and Peter Haynes stunts are average.",1301961600,,970,5.1455696202531644
