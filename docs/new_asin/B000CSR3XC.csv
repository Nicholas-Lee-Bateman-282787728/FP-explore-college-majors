8101836,5,B000CSR3XC,"The most popular dialogue in all of recorded history is Who's on First?  If you are under 50 you may never have heard of this...if that's the case I am very sorry about your hearing loss.  Don't despair.  There is a cure.  It does not involve a trip to the Doctor, or expensive hearing aids.
  Here's a three step plan to cure you.
Step one.  Get into a car or a bus or a train or a plane or a ...you get the idea.  Get in some sort of a vehicle and get on the road.  Don't stop until you hit I-90 if you are coming from Cape Cod or Boston.  Keep going to exit 30 then take route 28 South to Cooperstown, New York.  The baseball hall of fame is there.  If you're coming from the West, take a plane to Boston, then rent a car and follow the directions.

  Step Two:  Walk inside the Baseball Hall of Fame and go see Bud Abbott and Lou Costello and listen to them do 'Who's on First?'.  Yes they are in the Hall of Fame for this!!! For real !!!!!  Poor Jimmy Rice of the Red Sox can't get in, but Bud and Lou made it.
  Step Three:  Skip steps one and two and simply buy a copy of the VHS tape that I have for sale -or buy from any of the other fine Amazon sellers.  I'm Billrrrr.  I wanted to be Billr but that was taken.  Then I wanted to be Billrr but that was taken, too.  Then I.............was taken, three.  So I......Billrrrr.
  No review can do justice to the boys.  You just have to listen.  In addition to the Baseball bit, the guys tackle more than a dozen of the funniest sketches in show biz history, including some outstanding pieces like the Drill Sergeant and other army business.
  Guest stars include the sultry Peggy Lee and Rhonda Fleming (one M--just like Flaming)...the perky Theresa Brewer...the incredible Louis Armstrong...and then there's some old guy who used to hang around Rhode Island.  I think he played minor league ball in Pawtucket....he calls himself George Raft. I wonder what he did after he left the Providence area.
  I don't live in the past..but I sure like to visit it once in a while and this visit is five stars of five.

8101837,1,B000CSR3XC,"I purchased this DVD hoping to add two classic comedies to my collection. There is no doubt that the original film versions were hilarious. However, the quality of the video in this particular release is so poor as to make the imagery almost unintelligible. Most of the characters' faces appear as white light within a faint silhouette. The audio is fair if you feel nostalgic for the old radio days. I must confess that I was unable to sit through more than ten minutes of either feature. Surely modern digital enhancement could provide us with a viewable version of these films. I don't know if I'll ever buy another DVD without reading a review first.",1084492800,13,654,4.695652173913044
