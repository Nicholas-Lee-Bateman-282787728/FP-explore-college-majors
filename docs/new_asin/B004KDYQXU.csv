4396534,4,B004KDYQXU,"Genoa is the backdrop for this beautiful, quiet film of family members dealing with the loss of a mother. The two daughters react in radically different ways to their tragedy, while the father attempts to hold things together. There is an undercurrent of darkness and danger as the older daughter finds new friends and experiences and the younger one grieves through visions of her mother. Slow, gentle unfolding of a family trying to find its way.",1303171200,2,448,4.907894736842105
4396535,3,B004KDYQXU,"3.5 stars

Colin Firth can act his way out of a paper bag.  Kathleen Keener, one of those actresses that gives any film a feeling of reality is superb in this film. That said, this could be one of the more symbolic films I have seen. It is an OK film, but not a great one. Heavy on drama and darkness and grief.

A family has lost their mother in a car accident. The youngest daughter thinks she is to blame for the accident. The older daughter feels her life is out of control and not what she wants. Dad, is a college professor. He has a contact in Genova, an old college friend, who tells him of a job. Italy may just be the place to chase their demons away. The city is indeed beautiful, and we see quite a lot of it. the back streets and channels as the girls walk their way to piano lessons each day. Life moves on slowly, the older daughter is exploring her sexuality and acting out. The younger child is left to deal with the daily life. The city and the back alleys and the maze of streets are a metaphor for the inner turmoil of each of the members of the family. It is a beautiful film, a quiet film that does not say much but brings to the surface the emotions that surround the family. These emotions are transported to the audience, and we are in a sense filled with anxiety waiting for the next move.  The film was not what I expected, and it is not a great film, but well worth viewing.

4396536,2,B004KDYQXU,"As a long-time Colin Firth fan I looked forward to this film, but while his performance is dead on, the film was disappointing. Director Michael Winterbottom is more into being seen as an ""auteur"" than in creating a cohesive film. He thinks he is being naturalistic by not using any lighting, but the eye naturally captures more light than a camera lens does so several scenes are so dark it is difficult to tell who is talking in situations where this would not be true in real life. Don't expect the central mystery of the film to be resolved, that is apparently too low-brow for Mr. Winterbottom. To be fair, if you liked ""And When Was the Last Time You Saw Your Father,"" then you'll probably be moved by this one, too,  But from my POV, it doesn't deliver both artistry & story like some of Mr, Firth's other films -- A Month in the Country, Apartment Zero, Trauma, The King's Speech, etc. -- it is more just art for its own sake.",1302825600,8,934,4.398843930635838
4396537,2,B004KDYQXU,"I'm probably going to get negative votes for stating my opinion here, but I must tell you the truth. So here goes...(remember I told you so).

If for some reason you wish to be depressed, watch this movie. If you like watching paint dry, watch this movie. If you like watching people walking, watch this movie. If you like watching people watching other people, watch this movie. It is very dark, and extremely slow. I did NOT find it beautiful at all...in any form. I wish I had not wasted our hard earned money on this one.

I'm giving it 2 stars only because of the acting performance by the younger sister in the movie. I would, otherwise, have given it 1 star.",1302825600,16,665,4.3983739837398375
4396538,3,B004KDYQXU,"Have you ever done something so terrible that it ruined your life?  After a game in the car causes an accident and the death of her mother (Davis), Mary must live with the results.  Her and her sister along with thier father (Firth) travel to Italy for a year in hopes that the change of scenery will help the grieving process.  Each girl handles the life change differently.  Based on the preview, I was worried about watching this because it looked so depressing.  The first five minutes is very hard to watch, and sporadically there are tough parts, but this is not as bad as I was expecting.  The acting was great, and the story is very real, but I just couldn't get into it.  It was a little slow moving and seemed to go nowhere.  I can't give it a bad grade because it wasn't a bad movie, just a little slow.  Not really my kind of show. I know there will be many people who really like it though.  I give it a C+.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will, not one to watch over and over.",1302566400,17,998,4.119170984455959
4396539,5,B004KDYQXU,"This film is a truly beautiful, touching, and real piece of art. It is the most real depiction of life ever filmed. The film follows the lives of Joe (Colin Firth) and his daughters as they deal with the death his wife. Spending a year in Italy, the family is shown continuing their day to day lives as each character evolves and deals with their loss. One daughter becomes independent and rebellious while the other is lovingly haunted by the ghost of her mother. Joe does all that he can to just get through every day and give his daughters what they need. It is beautiful and touching. If you're looking for a lot of plot or action then this film is probably not for you.

4396553,5,B004KDYQXU,"SUMMER IN GENOA stars a father, who is a professor in Chicago, and who does a summer sabbatical in Genoa, Italy.  The father has two daughters, one a chubby one about 10 years old, and the other, a drop-dead gorgeous hottie about 16 years old.  The story begins when the two daughters are in the back seat of an automobile driven by their mother.  The mother is speeding along a highway in snowy Chicago, and the two girls are playing sort of an eye-covering game.  The cinematography is skillful, and the camera alternates between showing the speeding traffic in the opposite lane, and showing the girls goofing off.  The viewer will get a sense of what is about to happen (and it happens).  Apparently, the chubby younger girl covered up her mother's eyes, resulting in a fatal crash that kills the mother.

The father decides to take the two daughters to Genoa, Italy to distract their minds from the loss. And so, the trio relocates to Genoa.  The film frequently shows scenes of the two daughters, either together or alone, or with their father, walking through narrow dingy alleyways to and from their rented apartment.  In some scenes, we see prostitutes in the alley.  In another scene, the chubby daughter remarks on the urine smell in the alley.  In yet another scene, we see a dead rat in the alley.  In another scene, it is explained to us that flowers placed in the alleyway are in memory of somebody killed in the alley.  In yet another scene, a vase or something plummets from above and gets smashed right behind the chubby daughter. The frequent scenes of the many alleyways serves at least three purposes: (1) It adds a sense of stability to the storyline, in a story where each of the characters experiences chaos; (2) It adds a sense of suspense and danger (though fortunately, no harm ever comes to the girls during their many walks in the alleyway); and (3) Whenever we see one or both girls returning to the apartment by way of the alleyway walk, it brings a sense of relief to the viewer, because we know that the girl is obeying their father and returning home.

I mentioned chaos.  As if leaving Chicago and living in a dingy part of Genoa for the summer is not chaotic enough.  Anyway, the older girl quickly adapts, and finds friends her age, and smokes cigarettes with boys, and sunbathes on the beach with boys, and repeatedly gets completely naked with a boy.  (Discriminating gentleman will not likely winch or cover up their eyes, when the movie shows nearly every part of the anatomy of the teen's figure.). Chaos also happens with the chubby younger daughter, and she has frequent nightmares about her mother, and she repeatedly hallucinates and believes that her mother is talking to her, and she walks into a street of speeding traffic thinking that her mother is beckoning her from the other side, and the older sister says the f-word to the younger daughter.  The father experiences chaos, because he periodically engages in hunting expeditions, trying to locate the chubby younger daughter who habitually runs away from home.

In my opinion, the title of the movie should be changed to ""WILLA HOLLAND YUM-YUM"" because young actress Willa Holland appears on screen much more often than any of the other actors, and because of the frequent scenes of her wearing almost nothing.

Okay, well I was expecting a movie like UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN, which shares similar plot elements with SUMMER IN GENOA.  But the script for UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN has some of the most clever and artfully wrought dialogues of any movie.  UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN is a wonderous and joyful movie.  This is not to dismiss SUMMER IN GENOA.  SUMMER IN GENOA is more like a hybrid -- part documentary with slice-of-life dialogue, and part a suspenseful psycho-thriller Hitchcock movie.",1461456000,4,3788,4.739329268292683

It showed a family under tremendous stress from grief due to the loss of the wife and mother. It was not fun to watch and felt like 90 minutes of human tragedy with no hopeful resolutions. It is well acted and feels authentic. The bottom line is that we get a enough real life already and could have used a break from it for a while.,1437523200,,495,4.061224489795919

It was an ok movie about a father that's left with two daughters after his wife is killed in a car accident.  It's ok for him to go to Italy for a year but to uproot the girls to a country where they don't know the language or know anybody is a little irresponsible.  They lose the younger girl twice!!!  Also, the older girl thinks she is to good to keep an eye on her younger sister and makes her walk way behind her.  I really didn't understand the whole concept of this movie.

4396579,4,B004KDYQXU,Spoiler alert.  A gently presented and finely nuanced presentation of family life after the death of a loved one.  Colin Firth's performance is solid with good emotional range and frank believability.  Perla Haney-Jardine and Willa Holland are near perfect casting.  Holland's performance of a teenager muddling through rebellion and personal exploration resonate with adults and come across as authentic personal struggle and not just the average whining teenager.  The visions that Mary (Haney-Jardine) has of her mother are neither explained nor overdone.  She plays them well and it remains a mystery as to whether these visions are genuine or Mary's desperate psychological need to create an imaginary Mom.  Catherine Keener is a good cast and provides a good foil for Firth as the difficult friend whose attempts to insert herself into family life are not always met with success nor welcome.  A good slice of life that presents an honest vision into this fictional family's life.,1426896000,,986,5.2756410256410255

4396583,5,B004KDYQXU,"I think that one of the main reasons why other reviewers tend to rate this so poorly is because 1. they wanted to see a romantic Colin Firth film, or 2. they really didn't understand what was going on or had little or no empathy for what the characters had gone through.  This movie will mean a lot to you if you have lived through any facet of it.  It is a movie to be watched with your heart.

They do deal with some interesting issues that I have not seen in other movies.  And I'm going to try not to say too much in order so that I won't spoil it for you if you have not seen it.  However, I will point out that you should notice how the young girl, Mary, manifests guilt - so much so that she feels that she must suffer just like her relative.  Her sense of guilt develops into levels of psychosis where she starts to have hallucinations.  And these hallucinations are there to punish her for her crime, as she, Mary, must be seeing it or else these hallucinations wouldn't have developed.  Also, please notice that because everyone in the family is still suffering, silently, in their own way, they can not adequately see the horrendous torment that young Mary is going through except an outsider, Barbara.  And that character is played brilliantly by Catherine Keener.  Excellent performance here.  So smooth that it goes unnoticed.  She is such a great actress!

However, notice the scene where they are walking through the city and she is trying to give advice to the father, Colin Firth, about his daughter, Mary, and he snaps her head off.  Watch how brilliantly she portrays her emotions when all we can see is the back of her.  Excellent scene - very understated.  But I don't know of too many people who can let you know just how they're feeling and thinking with just their back.  So, I think Katherine was just awesome!

If you have every been through a deep, personal tragedy, especially as a parent, and been at a loss as to how to correctly pick up the pieces, then I think you will very much appreciate the ""below the surface"" action that is going on in this film.  Yes, it is very sensitive and very realistic.  The characters are not perfect and they do not have all the answers.  But through their struggle, they do come out the other side as victorious and the family remains intact and loving!!!  I just loved this film!!!

As the family wrestles with this Colin Firth feels he needs a change for himself and his two daughters and so he accepts a job in Genoa.  He meets up with his old friend who becomes their constant companion, played by Catherine Keener.  She is a wonderful character in the movie.

This is one of those wonderful movies with a good, sweet, touching story, yet shows so many delightful things about living in Italy, both good and bad.  You see gorgeous landscapes and churches, while at the same time I love how Colin Firth's daughter at one point holds her nose and complains about how an area they pass smells like urine.  I like that because I remember being in Paris and while being dazzled by the city on one hand I remember smelling urine as I walked down a side street.  This movie really shows the charm and the more real side of European life while telling a very pithy story about life.

It also shows how all of them wrestle with their own issues, from the youngest ones perspective, still imagining her mom, to his teenage daughter who wants boys and partying, to Colin Firth as an adult.  Very cute scenes with Firth and his daughters at times.  He is such a delightful actor.

The younger child is tormented nightly in her dreams and blames herself as does her sister for the accident that took their mother.

4396632,4,B004KDYQXU,"After his great performance in the movie ""Single Man"", Colin Firth seems like a natural choice for a role of a widower with two small children, both girls.  After horrific car accident in which his wife dies, father of two girls has to deal with his and their grief.  Five months after the accident they decide to leave Chicago and go to Genoa, Italy where his old college friend (beautifully played by Catherine Keener) finds him a summer job at the local university.

Story unravels from here.  Each one of them has to come to terms with their loss.  They use their senses, new environment and beauty of Italy to deal with their grief and sadness.  Surely, their loss is too fresh, not even a year has passed and there seem to be opportunities of all kinds for each one of them to search for their peace: swimming in beautiful sea, visiting historical sites, taking piano lessons, learning Italian and of course, seeking physical pleasures to compensate for their emotional loss.

Like in most stories, real or not, it takes only one critical moment to re-unite this fragmented family and reconcile their lives.  This is wonderful film with great performances and breathtaking views of Italian town of Genoa.  It is a story of loss and search for redemption, peace and new start.",1365465600,,1281,4.7342342342342345

4396637,4,B004KDYQXU,"I've been recently on somewhat of a Catherine Keener Kick, so I just had to watch ""Summer in Genoa.""

But there are surely other nice actors in this film as well:  Colin Firth, who nicely plays a widowed father of two girls; Willa Holland, who is more than just a pretty face; and Perla Haney-Jardine, who probably steals the show with an excellent performance, particularly for her age.  But Genoa is surely a character here as well.

So often, you see these films where Americans jet off to Europe to discover themselves.  They can let it all hang out there; after all, the same-old-lame-old restrictions just don't apply in the more liberal Old World!  Well, and it gives the actors an excuse to accept a role as they get to be on vacation while filming.  Yeah!  Everybody wins!

But surely not here.  The pace is both slower and faster in Europe - it depends upon what you are doing - and it doesn't feel like an excuse to film in Christopher Columbus' birthplace this time.  I really liked the cinematography here - or there more like it - and it is one Italian city that I haven't been to but would love to go.  Especially now.

During the film, the viewer is led to believe that Mr. Firth, who has gone through tragedy, will endure only more tragedy, and soon.  There is danger everywhere, and you're just waiting for the next shoe to fall in the country that is shaped like a boot.  But will he avoid getting kicked in the groin again?

Well, you'll have to view for yourself to find out.  A recommendation by me, on this film that shows how people can move past their tragedy, pain and guilt.  And realize that nobody has to do it alone.",1351123200,,1646,4.411960132890365

Not an uplifting story by any means but still an interesting one and if you're a Colin Firth fan, one you may like enough to see it (as I did). For those like me who like seeing scenes of 'how they live' in other countries, this movie gives an impression of what it might be like to live in such a place. There's not a lot of action or an end really to this film, it's dark, sad, and slow, it has it's moments. If you're into quiet dramas that make you feel, think, then you may find this worth your time. The acting alone keeps it from being a bad movie.

His character was also a little pathetic, so there wasn't much to like. I found myself saying over and over, ""Is this over yet?""

4396653,2,B004KDYQXU,"After his wife's sudden death, a university professor moves to Genoa for a year with his two daughters. The movie deals with their relationships and how each family member deals with the loss.

What bothered me most was the apparent lack of parental control. The two daughters seem to act without regard for others or consequences. For example, would a bright, pre-adolescent child really be reckless enough to cover both her mother's eyes while driving on an icy road? Why was the father's response so ""subdued"" when his teenage daughter disregards his curfew on going out with unknown Italian boys shortly after arriving in Genoa? Instead, he allows her to treat him disrespectfully and party every night and day, even when she fails to be there for her younger sister. Also, younger daughter, Mary, seems to think she can take off at any time without any consequence to follow her dead mother's ghost, e.g. leaving the church and worrying the entire family for hours; later she causes a traffic accident by running across a busy street - again without regard for others.  These actions may be examples of the girls acting out but then what lies underneath needs to be dealt with, not ignored or patted with ""There, there.  It's OK."" The budding romantic relationship between the father and one of his students seems out of place. Yes, the director may want to show the father getting on with his life but where does this romance lead? In the film - no where.

These issues are difficult to address but instead of delving into them, the director merely skims the surface - creating a sketch rather than a painting.  Most of the cinematography was done with hand-held camera and creates greater intimacy. However, sometimes the shaky pictures were too much, e.g. when Joe is desperately looking for Mary in the hillside.

Overall, beautiful location with fine actors Colin Firth and Catherine Keener but missed the mark.",1332115200,12,1921,4.877300613496932
4396654,4,B004KDYQXU,"I enjoyed this quiet movie. I agree with the reviewer who called it ""meditative."" There was a plot but, rather than being propelled by action scenes and extensive dialogue, it was moved along by the viewer's empathy and identification with the characters. I was especially affected by the performances of Colin Firth and Perla Haney-Jardine (a natural as the young daughter, Mary).
The movie was set in Genoa, a character in its own right. The street scenes (with noises and passers-by and narrow alleyways and chaotic traffic) depicted authentic Italy, not the sentimentalized and artificial Italy of most American movies.",1327795200,,623,5.24

A widower of 6 months accepts an offer to teach in Genoa, Italy, hoping to move his family of 2 daughters to a place where they can integrate the loss of their mother into their lives, and move forward. Predictably, the elder girl, Kelly, uses her emerging sexuality to submerge her grief. On the other hand, the younger, Mary, is haunted by the ""presence' of her mother, even in this foreign setting. Their father, Joe, accepts what happened, but has difficulty facing and managing the problems of his much-loved daughters. These issues play out against the backdrop of modern Genoa, a hard, stony city replete with plenty of dangers to the unsuspecting. This is the essence of this film. If you're looking for ""closure"", that modern fictional construct, you won't find it here. The value of this movie is its portrayal of grief as an open-ended process. Does Joe's family move forward, away from the tragedy. A bit. And this is an important message: grief requires time to evolve into acceptance. Does this make for an appealing movie? Not really. Not even with Colin Firth doing the processing.",1327708800,,1145,4.876923076923077

4396657,3,B004KDYQXU,"A SUMMER IN GENOA is one of those films that leaves its impression on the viewer after the film is over.  As far as a movie goes, not much happens -to the eye - but a lot of introspection and searching for meaning where there doesn't seem to be much makes the film worth watching.

Academician Joe (Colin Firth) and his daughters Kelly (Willa Holland) and Mary (Perla Haney-Jardine) have moved to Italy in an attempt to resolve the pain and resentment of the accidental death of Marianne (Hope Lange), their wife/mother.  Once settled in Genoa, Joe takes on a teaching job and meets an old college friend Barbara (Catherine Keener), Kelly feels her hormones raging and dashes about the old city with boys, while May concentrates on piano lessons and is disturbed by visions of her departed mother. Each finds escape in special fashions but in the end the introspection that occurs during that special summer alters the way the three remaining family members interact.

The actors do well with their parts, especially Colin Firth, and the film serves more as a lesson in grieving and how families can decide to be divided by loss of a loved one  or find a closer bond.  The end effect is a beautifully photographed, understated, quiet film that leaves room for food for thought afterward.  Grady Harp, November 11",1322179200,2,1312,4.753303964757709
4396668,2,B004KDYQXU,"I was looking forward to yet another intelligent Colin Firth film, but this one was too obtuse for me. The pace was so slow that the last 10 minutes seemed like 30.

One bonus of watching a film set in another country is that one gets to enjoy the foreign experience vicariously and to see beautiful vistas, but not in this film. The lighting was terrible. The actors were often filmed in shadow in dark interiors or alleys. I am sure the director did this on purpose to echo the darkness in the souls of the three grieving characters, but somewhere around 30 minutes into the film I didn't care. I perfectly understand why this film was never shown in theaters and went straight to DVD.",1321660800,3,687,4.4523809523809526
4396669,3,B004KDYQXU,"After reading a number reviews, I will give my own spin.

This is not a Hollywood tear jerking film using extreme scenes to tug at your emotions, but a very subtle and closer to a normal family's behavior when presented with a tragedy. Having said this, I think there are times in the movie when one feels a lack of direction and some frustration to the meandering scenes that appear to repeat themselves without any kind of direction or intent. But then again it does mimic often how one tries to deal with a tragedy in one's own life.

The story centers around a father and his two girls in Genoa for the summer to find closure after the tragic death of their mother.

Instead of coming closer to each other, like the dark alleyways in Genoa, they go on separate paths.

Once in Genoa, the father is lost between his feeling for one woman who is not as sexy, but more down to earth and responsible to the needs of his daughters and another woman who is carefree and liberating, but not interested in the family trappings. This only makes him more isolated to how he really feels as he is not yet ready for starting a relationship with either.

The oldest daughter despite coming off as a superficial selfish sex crazed brat, seems trapped between her desire to feel needed by those outside of her family, but finding only teenage boys who are just as self-centered as herself. Hey she is an American teenager coming of age in Genoa with a confused father in denial and a little sister wracked with guilt for her mother's death. You'd look for emotional comfort elsewhere too!

This leads to the youngest daughter, believing that she is the cause of her mother's death to the extent that she imagines her mother still alive and talking to her and touching her. It is like a subconscious hope that her mom will come back to still guide her in life (and soothe the guilt away), but reality just deepens her pain to the point of her behaving suicidal without consciously knowing it (not everyone will see this).

In the end, let us just say they come to realize (by narrowly missing another family tragedy) that only by caring and comforting each other can they heal and enjoy life again.

While I like the concept, I do wish the movie was a little more focused and involving, otherwise the same result could have been achieved as a short film instead.",1321228800,,2350,4.512941176470588
4396670,2,B004KDYQXU,"If this was even loosely based on Nicolas Roeg's hauntingly surreal ""Don't Look Now,"" it failed--well, mostly. There were snippets that could have come from ""Don't Look Now"" but they had no bearing on the plot--or lack thereof.  Other than that, the only thing I see that bears resemblance or any sense of inspiration would be the fact that a grieving family moved to Italy to try and cope with the loss of a loved one.

The film plodded along slowly. It does get the point across--the young actresses play their roles well--but the dialogue seems sparse and unmoving through about half of it. I think the salvation comes from Colin Firth and Catherine Keeler, both of whom are capable and natural.

The scenery is lovely, and I did feel like a trip to Genoa at some point in my life would be a good thing, but all in all I found myself drifting.  There were a few moments where it seemed like something was about to happen, it just never got there.

Not a terrible film, but more like a Saturday-afternoon-while-folding-the-laundry film than a Friday-evening-epic-entertainment kind of film.",1320451200,4,1092,4.756613756613756

That a 10 year old would cover the eyes of the driver when the driver was driving 60 miles an hour down a busy highway is simply not believable. I found both children unsympathetic.

The younger daughter is racked with guilt and sees visions of her mother, the teenage daughter rebels by chasing boys, while dad enjoys his job and his students.

With a cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; style and plot, this film feels like a reality show.  Dialogue is mumbled and often insignificant, emotions are muted and interactions are casual, the handheld camera is often shaky, and it all seems too ordinary to be interesting for an hour and a half.  The children are often lost among the dark and winding alleyways of the city, building tension that, unfortunately, never pays off.  The script (which annoyingly sometimes said they were there for a year, other times just there for the summer) goes on and on about their daily activities in  a new city and that's realistic, but not, for me, necessarily entertaining.

Firth is very good as the father, but we never get to know or understand him well.  Only once does he mention his wife and his feelings about her aren't clear.  He seems to get over her quickly enough, embracing the city and romancing a local.  Willa Holland is convincing as a self-centered and headstrong teen and is thoroughly unlikable.  The youngest daughter is more sympathetic, but there was something lacking that kept me from caring about her.
