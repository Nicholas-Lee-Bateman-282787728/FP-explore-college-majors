8006328,3,B00014NEU8,"Let's start by clearing any possible misperceptions: While this has the Playboy name and logo, it does not, in fact, have anything whatsoever to do with the Playboy empire as most of us know it (Hef, Playmates, the mansion...class...). Instead it's a behind-the-scenes feature on an old Playboy TV show. Playboy TV licenses the name, but other than having naked women in it there really is no other tie to the granddaddy of them all.

So...don't be expecting to see naked Playmates, and definitely don't be confused with the slightly-similar title to the E! hit series ""The Girls Next Door."" ""Sexy Girls Next Door"" was a reality show that actually predated the E! show, and again, it isn't even set at the mansion.

What it does have are some pretty hot naked chicks who say, show and do things that you'd never see Playmates do. Everything about this is raunchier than the magazine ever was, so you're seeing spread-legged nudity, light touching (even by female partners) and you get the idea. That's mostly good in my book, although some of the women aren't top-rung.

It is, however, hokey and contrived with a lot of over-the-top faux/forced sexuality, which is annoying. But I loved the vignettes in the bonus footage, which are three- to five-minute full-nude music video clips of some the women who were in the series.

Overall...not bad. Very close to four stars because of the vignettes.",1444953600,2,1396,4.852941176470588

The women are natural beauties and the film is not shy about showing off their wonderful assets, leaving nothing to the imagination.  Best Playboy production I have seen...ever!",1082937600,23,256,4.930232558139535
