7002748,5,B00T797NL4,"Although the acting was not top notch, the camera angles could have been adjusted and remastered for a better picture, the overall plot of the movie was good. Would have loved to see more time and money into this film but overall an excellent story",1432944000,,248,4.533333333333333
7002749,5,B00T797NL4,"For me, this is a very entertaining film, except for the fact that I had to do triple takes on certain scenes in order to piece together and understand a couple of confusing plot points.

However, It's also a frustrating movie for me because I'm not Bible literate which apparently is an important prerequisite according to the end of the movie wherein our heroine pre-med student is flying back to Wash. D.C. and we observe her diligently reading the 18th chapter of the Book of Matthew which has been book marked for her by her mother.

The other point I find both confusing and intriguing is the history of the two families who originally had joint ownership of the home; but ultimately had to sell during the depression to a Russian family, who are later murdered and buried in the basement.
In this way both families reclaim control of the house again, although the African American family; perhaps scared by the spiritual consequences of the heinous act, move away from Minnesota to Wash. D.C..
The other family, interestingly enough is white and we are talking about the Great Depression; this was not exactly a period known for progressive views and policies on racial equality.

The fact that a white and African Am. family jointly purchased a huge home in pre depression America is a bit of an eye opener for me.

There are some clever and effective red herrings in the script and we're blessed with excellent casting and direction.
Thank goodness there are no dreadful scenes of gratuitous guts and gore or hysterical females screaming their lungs out.
The costume and makeup people did an admirable job especially with the ghostly inhabitants.

All in all it's a very pleasant and entertaining film which is more like a Agatha Christie mystery than a hair raising horror flick and frankly I don't think you really have to read the entirety of Matthew in order to enjoy the movie.
Just assume this a family who just happen to be very devout Christians, but the viewer is not bludgeoned and subjected to religious pontification.

Edited a day later after a good nights sleep to include the following thoughts:

This was written and directed by Roy Belfrey who is African American and the film draws heavily on his background as a Af. Am. man nurtured by a close knit family in a big city. The film reflects not only his knowledge of inner city living but also his personal family influences which is self evident and heartfelt.

Michelle (our pre-med major heroine) and her friends sitting around a large round dining room table trading stories of the afterlife and related topics is one of the highlights of the film; in which we observe the kids recalling wisdom passed down to them from their parents and grandparents. The scene flows so naturally that the viewer is drawn in comfortably and effortlessly and also serves as a metaphor for the quintessential sitting-around-the-campfire setting; other films generally use this cinematic device with little thought and to no avail as if the writers felt it was simply a matter of satisfying a de rigueur component for a ghost story.

The character of the airline stewardess is deceptively minor but reveals her true importance in the plot at the end of the movie when Michelle is flying back to Wash. D.C. You will have to exercise your little gray cells and figure it out for yourselves.

The horror elements are perfectly balanced and executed; subtle yet sufficiently startling and unnerving without excess.

It's tempting to categorize this as a ""faith based"" film, but if you think about it, the plot is drawn from the well of the director's family background but is decidedly not self serving, as other true ""faith based"" films are.

After watching this again and paying closer attention, the eloquence of the storyline is clearly revealed.
This is what happens when one watches internet movies while being distracted by other activities.
Therefore I am changing this from 4 to 5 stars.",1432512000,4,3953,4.84
7002750,2,B00T797NL4,"It seems that a lot of black filmmakers only cast very light-skinned black females as the lead role. If she's under thirty she must be light-skinned and usually with long hair. If she's biracial, that's even better.

Since I have females old and young of all complexions in my family and social circle I am offended to see this imagery being put out by black filmmakers, especially when their largest audiences are brown and dark-skinned black females. It smacks of the highest form of disrespect for one's audience.

I have always advocated that black females and men such as myself stop supporting these films that do not recognize the beauty of brown and dark-skinned black girls and women. I, for one, will not support this film or any others like it. I care not what the content of the movie is once I see that the super light brown paper bag test is still in effect. And I strongly suggest others do the same.",1432512000,2,915,4.573170731707317
7002751,3,B00T797NL4,This movie s a classix  to me  for those who don't understand prey more and read matthew in the bible. This movie is far from any other era its head of its  time justbecause you don't see a girl dress in white with a fake preist  yelling  the same as all  the other horrors there no reason or fact this should be five stars its not cheap and shot very well  no fake cam cord crap,1432425600,2,379,3.9078947368421053
7002752,3,B00T797NL4,It was ok but had a tendency to lose me...was confusing at times. Also the acting could have used a little work.,1432425600,3,112,4.136363636363637
7002753,2,B00T797NL4,"The film opens with some screaming, blood, Matthew 18:19-20 and a goat. Don't worry, it all ties together. Michelle (Jennifer Jayleen Martinez) opts to go away to the University of Minnesota. She has a free room to live in, as her family are part owners of some real estate, something they don't talk about. While there, she makes friends, butts head with Ms Hillshire (Maureen Kurtz), visits her Aunt (Luenell) and is irritated by ghosts that she doesn't believe in.

There are some weird scenes in this and we find out there are gifts, but why is not really explained. The film spends too much time developing Michelle's character and then crams all the light horror in the last 15 minutes, making this a fairly lame ghost story.

Guide:F-bomb. No sex. Brief male butt nudity.",1432339200,,778,4.7555555555555555
7002754,1,B00T797NL4,"Like a bad black exploitation film from the 1970's updated with current technology and a decent budget.  Mawkish acting, inane script and no Caucasian actor with a speaking part is anything but evil.  Better watch Blacula on Youtube instead: now that is a fun film.  There are some production values here: moody music, atmosphere, sets, and some talent too. But I'm afraid that this film falls flat on its face.",1432080000,2,411,4.8428571428571425

As for the strengths, the ghost make-up/effects are quite good, and our lead actress supplies a palpable unsettled ambiance from start to finish. Couple all that with what seems like a first film effort from the producers, and you should have a clear idea of what to expect. Enjoy!",1434931200,,411,4.802816901408451
