8417313,1,B00005V1ZD,"As far as using fitness videos at home goes I'm a beginner. As far as exercising in itself-I'm not. I am an active person. I recently became interested in weight training videos, because I wanted to add weight training into my fitness routine at home, in a timely and effective manner. So this was the first weight trainging video I bought. The information from the back cover about the format and it's running time noted as 110 minutes was appealing and lead me to believe that this video would have the thorough, effective routine I was looking for. First of all since I'm new to fitness videos so my review may seem nieve since I don't know the  typical formats. The scenery and music had somewhat of an 80's nostalgia having a dark, unenergetic look. Itlooked outdated and boring. The instructors emphasis on correct form and positioning were good , he spent so much time talking through each segment, you would only get about 12-15 reps per muscle group. I'm not saying the talking was bad I think it took away a lot of time to actually get more effectiveness put into the routine. Sure, with the one set of 5-lb. weights I could feel the effectiveness the exercises would have, but by the time you start to feel any real effectiveness or the burn-it's over! Time to stretch and move to the next muscle group, and his set up for the next routine gave too long a break- I easily became bored waiting for him to finish talking through the setup and found myself often fast forwarding through it. The info I read on the box claims that you can perform over 60 toning exercises. Well, that including him and another woman doing alternate moves for the same basic  exercises he showed you in the beginning, but it was still just as slow paced and still only about 12 reps each. 60 moves or not my body sure didn't feel like it had done that many. By the end of this tape I was tired. Unfortunately not from having a good workout, but from the boredom and having to find the strength and patience needed to get through the workout that felt more like a lecture.",1020556800,12,2060,4.461538461538462
