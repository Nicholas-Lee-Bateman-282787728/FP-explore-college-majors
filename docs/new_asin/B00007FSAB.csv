7975756,5,B00007FSAB,"I was a first time coach for 4 and 5 year old soccer. I was familiar with the game as I played 20 years ago in high school. It was a great refresher for me and helped me to introduce some technique at an early age.  With this and other websites I was able to have great fun with my young team.  They may not remember all the ""technique"" but they got a great base education and we had tons of laughs.",1190592000,,399,3.8536585365853657
7975757,1,B00007FSAB,"First of all, I paid $25 for this, which was way too much.  Second, it really doesn't give a lot of ideas for teaching little kids how to play soccer.  Sure, there are some drills, but not very many--not enough to keep a bunch of 5 & 6 year-olds content for 60 minutes.

And by the way, what kind of medication did he use to keep the group of kids in the video so focused?  If I had kids with that much attention span, I wouldn't need the help the video purports to provide.

Bottom line--too expensive, and very little material of worth.  I've seen much better stuff out there.  Keep looking, you'll find it.",1160784000,2,609,4.243478260869566
7975758,5,B00007FSAB,"I bought this video for my wife who is coaching 6-7 year olds.  This is her second year to be coaching, and she was just limping along and getting by in her practices.  I suprised her with this video, and she was very excited after watching it.  She couldn't wait for the next practice.  After the practice, she said it was the best she ever had because she used the techniques from the video.  On the video, the instructors go into good detail and break things down to make them simple.  They do a good job of giving an outline of how to run a practice from beginning to end.  I would recommend this video to anyone coaching 5-8 year olds.",1160611200,5,640,4.239669421487603
7975759,5,B00007FSAB,"Over 20 games for soccer practices of 4-8 year olds. Soccer basics of kicking, passing dribbling and shooting set up into games plus how to interact with the kids and make sure they all have fun while learning the game. I have played soccer my whole life but had no idea how to teach it to my 5 year old team. I would watch one section the DVD about 10 minutes before heading out the door and that was enought to run the entire practice. The parents of the kids thought I was a pro and wanted me to coach again this year.",1143158400,21,521,4.067961165048544
