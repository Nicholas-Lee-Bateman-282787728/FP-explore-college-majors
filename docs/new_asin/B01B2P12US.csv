8749137,5,B01B2P12US,"My order just arrived, and I've been watching DVD 236 - ""Krav Maga: Real Life Situation Techniques"" for about 30 minutes now... and I am impressed. The production quality is quite good, and the techniques/scenarios are realistic - there's no Ninja/Operator/Warrior/Hero mysticism here. Just real-world practical application of Krav Maga that could be used by anyone. This is not a ""Learn Krav Maga"" video series - the viewer should have exposure to maritial arts prior to viewing, as the combinations demonstrated are not for beginners. You don't have to be a Grandmaster of (Insert Martial Art Style Here), but having basic knowledge of blocks, kicks, and strikes is a must. Be forewarned - the packaging is designed for worldwide distribution, and the video titles and captions are written in French. The English narration is good, and easy to understand.",1489449600,3,857,5.172661870503597
