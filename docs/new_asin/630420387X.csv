If you fancy a feel-good movie with a hopeful ending then this one is good medicine. The title track is great too -  an instrumental version of ""Roll to Me"" by Del Amitri; reminds me of the late Bob Berg.",1481673600,,369,4.197183098591549

7864809,1,630420387X,"I have to admit that I didn't see this from the start - it was on TV - but I saw a fair amount of the last part of the film. I'd say bad script, bad acting, bad directing - a good film to erase after you have recorded it from TV. It looked like a waste of talented actors.",1195603200,,272,3.55
7864810,4,630420387X,"I've rented this video 10 times so I figured it was time to buy it.  I can't really explain what it is about this movie that I love so much but I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it.  It takes place in Temecula California and if the movie does this location any justice, it's beautiful land. To be honest, I haven't seen the movie in about a year because my favorite video store went out of business and nobody else seems to have it.  It's definately a movie worth seeing and if you're like me, you'll just have to own it!",981590400,5,545,4.027777777777778
7864811,2,630420387X,"Ok, ok--I rented this video on the strength of its having a hot air balloon on the cover, and figured it'd be ""fluff"" to watch on an evening we wanted to curl up with someting light, ""easy watching""  for my balloon-pilot wife.
This is your basic pair-'em-off formula, with  just enough angst to keep things moving, and everyone happy in the end.  It  does have some very nice balloon shots, including some technical  mistakes...which only a pilot will notice.  The locale is Temecula, CA,  which is an active center of balloon flight.  Prepare to watch every  stereotype of California flakiness you have ever heard of.
Looking for an  evening of light entertainment?  This will fill the bill.",949104000,2,692,4.829059829059829
