8511863,5,B0077PGIKC,"What a wonderful surprise! I never saw the pilot for the TV show and guess what - it's included in this collection. My wife and I watched about 5 episodes beginning with the pilot and while it was enjoyable to see the old episodes, that is exactly what they are - old - and very outdated. However, it's still entertainment and it's wonderful to see the old gang that I watched as a young person. That may be the reason why I bought these DVD's - to recapture the good old days. Some of the jokes are old and outdated but you still laugh!

Ozzie and Harriet and their boys remind me of Leave it to Beaver. Wholesome, family fare. The life in the fifties is so much different than what life is in this day and age. Life was simpler back then. Do I wish for the good old days? Not really but it's good to see them as entertainment.",1389052800,,828,4.142857142857143

That is, if you've already purchased Millcreek Entertainment's previous releases, BEVERLY HILLBILLIES - MEET THE CLAMPETTS and FAMILY TV CLASSICS. This 85 episode collection is comprised of the 40 episode Beverly Hillbillies collection and the 45 episode Family TV Classics collection.

I like Millcreek Entertainment. I've always felt that you got a good ""bang for your buck"" from them. I've also been impressed by the excellent customer service I have received from them. In recent times however, they have developed a habit of repackaging previous releases under different titles. Although they have every right to do this, I personally find this practice annoying, as one must keep ever vigilante so as not to purchase something you already own.",1334534400,3,848,5.144927536231884
