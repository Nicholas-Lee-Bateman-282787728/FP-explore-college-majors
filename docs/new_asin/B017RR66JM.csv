7515558,5,B017RR66JM,"Though this movie looked a bit too religious, we were pleased to watch and discover that it wasn't too heavy handed on the ""church/bible"" thing. Great story line and excellent acting from the entire cast. Because of a few mild expletives, I would rate this as a ""PG"" film, for ages 13 and over. You will most likely want the film to end differently, but will probably agree that it ends in the best way possible. Never a dull moment!",1458000000,,433,4.425

7515630,1,B017RR66JM,"I watched this entire movie, and I cannot believe how bad it was.

Here is the ridiculous story.....

A man named Nick dies in a car accident - - another man named Eddie ran out in front of his car, causing Nick to go off the road.

Later, Eddie is in an accident, and he also dies.

So, Eddie and Nick - - both dead - - stand around and talk for about a minute about how Nick blames Eddie for killing him.

Eddie's body moves, and it is realized that Eddie is not quite dead.

Nick tells Eddie to jump back into his body because he is not dead yet and life is precious.

Eddie refuses, and instead makes an offer to Nick that Nick should jump into the body instead.

So, Nick's spirit goes into Eddie's body and lives.

By an unbelievable coincidence, Nick's family of three children find Eddie's body (with their father Nick inside), and they revive him and take him home.

Nick spends two days with his wife and three children, and he never tells them who he really is, but somehow, all of them know.

Nick realizes that it is time to move on, and he lets himself die inside of Eddie's body, but first he says a mushy goodbye to the wife and kids.

The final scene is Nick in some kind of a heaven where he sees his dead father and a group of other dead men, and they all stand around fishing.

The end.

Now, can anyone tell me that this mess was a good movie???  Are you kidding???",1468368000,,1386,4.119402985074627

7515635,5,B017RR66JM,"A beautifully written story of sorrow, lost friendship and family turmoil because of the untimely death of the head of the family...all resolved
through the power of faith, love, hope, forgiveness and letting go from those who remain and those who go on to eternity.
God has touched my family through this film and it provoked us to engage in conversations about the after life and those who are no longer
with us - (we even pulled out family albums afterwards as we reminisced and LOVED).

8740341,5,B017RR66JM,"A beautiful lake and forests are the backdrop for this wonderful movie. A man who had spent too much time building a cabin (instead of his family) is killed in an accident. The outlaw responsible for his death is killed in another accident, but has a chance to live; instead he gives that chance to the cabin builder. There are laughs, the actors are very good, I really liked it.",1515369600,,380,4.442857142857143

It truly shows his range as an actor.",1468713600,,294,4.462962962962963
