8633907,4,B00HNTOYT4,"Nine reviews here, and all of them miss the point.

There is action, but no, it is not an action movie.

This is an intense film of cross-purposes, hot tempers, bad decisions, and sticky situations. The cinematography is flawless, full of color and grit and detail. The characters are fully realized... and deeply flawed. The suspense is nonstop. It starts cold with a group of people around a table planning a bank robbery. But there is a deeper game, here, and higher stakes. The two plots collide in an unexpected way.

Do yourself a favor and don't read any of the spoilers. Just watch the movie and let it unfold, and keep asking yourself, ""What would I do in this situation...?""",1531180800,,684,4.636363636363637

8633909,1,B00HNTOYT4,"Unrelated crimes are connected in ways that become apparent if you force yourself to sit through 513 Degrees, but it's not worth the time and trouble to find out.

One of the crimes is a terrible idea on its face.  Tom Sizemore (hammy, but one of the film's only highlights) and his crew plan on robbing a corrupt private bank that is laundering money.  The take?  4 million dollars in cash.  The problem?  Whoever the bank is laundering that money for is probably not somebody you want to screw with, so you need a plan to vanish from the face of the earth after pulling off a robbery like that.  There's no indication in the film that the characters gave any thought to who's money they were actually taking.  That makes these criminals very dumb.

The other crime makes little sense but involves transporting something in a cooler from Mexico and someone named El Loco (Danny Trejo, naturally) to the United States.  Beyond the fact that the characters doing the transporting are unbelievable idiots, there are faster, easier and more secure ways to transport their cargo (which fits in a cooler), even if it is illegal.  It's not like the crooks couldn't forge papers to make the cargo seem legit, and it would probably make more sense to conclude the business completely in Mexico rather than driving through the desert with such easily spoiled cargo in a beer cooler.

513 Degrees is filled with twists and double crosses but none of it is believable or exciting.  By the time the end credits roll the movie feels like the idiot child of Pulp Fiction and Crash, but without the wit and originality of the former or the humanity of the latter.  This one is a dog, but once you realize it's by a French writer/director who seems to think he has some insights into American culture it's also kind of condescending and offensive.  Avoid.",1478217600,,1839,4.65015479876161

8633915,2,B00HNTOYT4,"The film centers around brothers Mike (Avelawance Phillips) and Tre (Malik Barnhardt). The opening scene is a teaser that repeats itself 40 minutes into the film. No sense attempting to figure out what it has to do with the plot. Mike recently gets out of prison and wants to spend time with his daughter. His ex-wife wants nothing to do with him. He gets involved in a fool proof bank robbery.

Meanwhile his brother wants to do his last job. He is transporting money to ""El Loco"" (Danny Trejo) a bad guy in Mexico. At age 13 ""El Loco"" killed two grown men with his school pencil for raping his sister. Then he killed her so she wouldn't have to live with the shame. Shades of Keyser Sze. And a 30 minute plot spoiler...they have to bring back a kidney because no one in the US will give one up for the gross amounts of cash they are shelling out to get one from Mexico. Add some more undeveloped plot twists, some killing etc.

A kidney? Seriously? Everyone has two and you can live with one. I can't imagine getting a kidney donor is not that tough.  Now if they made it a liver, I could see that. Danny Trejo who doesn't have 513 degrees as the cover suggests is in the film for only a couple of minutes. The 513 is explained at the end of the film, as it appears no one could come up with a decent clever title. What is the shelf life of a kidney in a small igloo cooler in the desert? They do make coolers that plug into the vehicle lighter.

The plot wasn't tight. The drama outweighed the action and wasn't that great.  The film wasn't engaging and you really didn't care what happened to the main characters which were all criminals and weasels. Not worth a special effort to watch.

F-bomb. Brief stripper nudity.",1398470400,5,1723,4.318885448916409
