8371749,5,B002K6XUZ4,"We saw Patrick Murray on a recent cruise.  His skill was up to and in some ways better than the present run of ventriloquists on TV!  His humor was a blend of cruise specific and current topics.  We all wanted to see even the same show again!  We missed getting a DVD on board so I found this tape.  It did not let us down!  His characterization of Matilda is excellent.  When he and his wife perform together, it is quite impressive.

The DVD needs to be available off the ship!  Anyone who has enjoyed the current wave of ventriloquism will find Patrick Murray right up there in skill, material and timing!",1390521600,,608,4.357142857142857
