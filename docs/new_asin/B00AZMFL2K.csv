5531262,4,B00AZMFL2K,"Last Fall, we were treated to the triumph that was ""Argo"", a historical political thriller the likes of which we hadn't seen much since the 1970s. About the same time, another historical political thriller from Chile was released in certain foreign markets, after making a splash at the 2012 Cannes film festival. The movie is now finally being released into US theatres, with a DVD release on the horizon as well.

""No"" (2012 release from Chile; 115 min.) brings the true story of how the military regime of Pinochet, under pressure from the international community after 15 years of dictatorship, called a referedum in 1988 on whether General Pinochet should stay on for another 6 years. A ""yes"" vote meant another 6 years, and a ""no"" vote meant the end of the Pinochet regime. As the movie opens, we are introduced to Ren&eacute; Saavedra (played by Gael Garcia Bernal), an advertizing wizzard (we see him presenting a new, US-style, commercial for the ""Free"" brand of cola). Saavedra is approached by the NO campaign to bring some new ideas to the table. We get to see the actual commercials that were being considered or used by both the YES and NO campaigns, and they are dreadful on both sides. When Saavedra makes his pitch to the NO side (namely, ""we need to sell a product that people will want to buy""), the initial reaction of the NO campaign is very negative, even hostile. At that point we are just about half-way into the movie and to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, writer-director-coproducer Pablo Larra&iacute;n does an outstanding job in bringing us a good feel for the build-up of the NO campaign (at some point someone exclaims ""We need more content! We'll never be able to fill 15 minutes of TV airtime every day!""), and how it all leads up to the frantic last days of the campaign. Second, the movie is shot as if to bring you the late 1980s for real: the movie is shown in a 4:3 ratio (rather than the usual 16:9 widescreen ratio), and is shot as if this is a home movie, with heavily grained images and light contrasts. Third, I read somewhere that the movie was made on a shoe-string budget, proving once again that you don't need a hunder million dollars to make an exciting and engaging movie. The art-house theatre I just saw this at here in Cincinnati was absolutely packed, which is great news indeed. If you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign movie, you cannot go wrong with this. ""No"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1366070400,9,2569,4.643956043956044
5531263,4,B00AZMFL2K,"You might notice as the film No begins that the colors are faded, the images aren't very crisp and the whole thing kind of looks like a Youtube clip of an MTV video they recorded back in the eighties. And then you'll begin to observe that this is a good thing. The tattered cinematography allows the director, Pablo Larrain, to weave news footage, telenovela clips, commercials and music videos from a quarter of a century ago seamlessly into his political drama of the 1988 referendum on the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, drawing the viewer back to that time and place.

This Chilean made, Spanish language film tells a fascinating story that makes reading the subtitles well worth the effort. In 1988. Pinochet was feeling the pressure from other nations (particularly the United States), to put himself in the hands of the electorate after years of military dictatorship. The vote will be a simple one. ""Yes"" means Pinochet will be in power another eight years and ""No"" means he must leave office.

The ""No"" campaign has little hope of success. They are given 15 minutes of television air time each day for twenty days. The ""Yes"" campaign also has 15 minutes a day (along with the other 23 and a half hours a day, along with glowing press and radio coverage guaranteed by the dictatorship).

The ""No"" campaign is composed of all political parties opposed to the President: Communists, Social Democrats, Libertarians, etc. Most have little hope of actually winning the election. But they hope to use the air time to expose the wrong doings of the government. They envision a daily barrage of the names and faces of the people wrongly imprisoned, killed or ""disappeared"" by the government.

But along comes a director of television commercials who wants to run a very different campaign. Rene (a fictionalized version of a real ad man played by Gael Garcia Bernal) wants to sell democracy using the same jingles, happy images and garish colors he uses to sell soda and microwave ovens. Many are appalled that these important issues would be trivialized in such a way, but Rene has one advantage that others in the campaign lack: he believes he can win.

The film follows Rene's work to use all that he has learned in advertising (humor, imagery, marketing, etc) to bring down a dictator. Along the way, he is threatened with the loss of his job, his home and the safety of his family. But he persists.

Now if you want to avoid spoilers, please don't look in any South American history books before you see the film. The central conflict in the film reminded me of one that many organizations face, that even the Church faces: should we ever compromise the things we hold dear to make our beliefs and values more palatable to the world?

Watching the film, I thought about G. K. Chesterton's response to critics who reprimanded him for making jokes about serious topics: ""The truth is, as I have said, that in this sense the two qualities of fun and seriousness have nothing whatever to do with each other, they are no more comparable than black and triangular"" and ""[The critic] thinks that funny is the opposite of serious. Funny is the opposite of not funny, and of nothing else.""",1365984000,3,3189,4.755877034358047
5531264,5,B00AZMFL2K,"""No"" is the mostly true story of how advertising men shaped a foredoomed television campaign into a revolutionary event-the peaceful overthrow of Augusto Pinochet in Chile in 1988.

Garcia Bernal is Yves Montand cool, although he is never the face of the opposition. Saavedra orchestrates the drumbeat of the campaign which convinces voters to leave their homes and cast a single vote.

This is a superb film that rightly earned an Oscar nomination. Well-directed and fast paced, it is a must for your home library.",1364083200,,1394,7.916666666666667
5531265,5,B00AZMFL2K,"""No"" in its first minute is a jarring visual experience.  It's grainy and shaky, as though it were a youtube video blown onto the screen, and it's only well into the movie when we realize that the visuals are meant to evoke the visuals of late 1980s Chilean television so that actual television footage from that era could match seamlessly with the rest of the film.  Once we overcome this psychological hurdle we come to appreciate ""No"" as a moving and stirring tale.

It's 1988, and Pinochet's military dictatorship of Chile has endured for fifteen years.  Facing growing international pressure (namely, US pressure), the dictator decides to hold a referendum whether to extend his rule by another 8 years.  It seems to the majority of those most opposed to him (40 percent of Chileans live below the poverty line, and there are tens of thousands of political dissidents either killed, exiled, or disappeared) that the referendum is just a sham, and they are determined to ignore it.  But one adman (played by the always wonderful Garcia Bernal) is determined to get the apathetic (the young) and the scared (middle-class women in their sixties) to vote, and to finally topple Pinochet from power.

There are two dimensions to the film, both equally powerful and effective.  The first dimension is how a political/media strategy is formed and executed with limited resources.  Knowing that Pinochet's first weapon of choice is to instill fear in Chileans, the adman wisely decides to instill hope, excitement, and optimism with a colorful, funny, and irreverent media campaign.  He carefully calibrates that to stir people into action you should not remind them of the terrible times and sacrifices made in the past (people would rather forget these things), but remind them of the good times ahead if Chile were to become an open and free democracy.

The second dimension is the adman's personal struggles that reveal the deep tensions within Chilean society, and here the director has used a lot of creative license.  The adman is married to a political dissident who lives with an artist when she is not in jail, and she constantly reminds him how by seeking to struggle he is helping to legitimize the fraud that is the referendum.  His boss in the ad agency is close to the dictatorship, and he becomes the dictatorship's main media strategist, and thus the adman's antagonist.  And he has a son whom he is trying to protect from Chile's political turmoil while fighting to create for him a better future.

The premise of the film -- that a media campaign that lasted for 15 minutes on television for 27 dyas -- toppled Chile's military dictatorship is shaky at best, pure fantasy at worst.  Nevertheless, ""No"" is a very stirring film that will be celebrated by Chileans for a long time as its ""Birth of a Nation.""",1363910400,11,2821,4.8580375782881005
5531266,4,B00AZMFL2K,"Like ""Argo,"" Pablo Larrain's ""No"" hurls us right into the center of a recent historical crisis. And, like ""Mad Men,"" it is a compelling portrayal of the advertising game, and how it can be used for good or ill. In the case of ""No,"" ads are used very much for the good.

""No"" is set in Chile in 1988. The dictator Augusto Pinochet has been in power for 15 years; Chile enjoys prosperity under his rule, but at the cost of vicious political repression, including the ""disappearance"" of thousands of dissidents. Facing a tidal wave of negative international opinion, Pinochet schedules a plebiscite--a simple up-or-down vote, ""Si"" or ""No,"" as to whether he should be allowed to stay in power for another eight years. A ""No"" would mean an orderly transition to the formation of a new government.

Rene Saavedra (Gael Garcia Bernal), a hotshot Santiago ad man, at first is indifferent to the plebiscite; his life is good, after all. When the opposition asks him to orchestrate the ""No"" ad campaign--a mere 15 minutes every late night in the month before the vote, as mandated by Pinochet--Rene at first refuses. But when he sees Pinochet's police rough up his estranged wife Veronica (Antonia Zegers), he changes his mind on the spot.

Opposition leaders have no hope of winning the plebiscite, and seek merely to stake out the moral high ground against Pinochet. Rene, however, is bent on winning. He overrules the lofty ideas of his employers in favor of a happy, bouncy ad campaign to associate a ""No"" vote with progress and a better future for Chile. The campaign strikes a chord with Chileans, but Rene and his crew face increasing threats from Pinochet's thugs. Furthermore, Rene's boss, Lucho Guzman (Alfredo Castro), is handling Pinochet's ad campaign, and is not above stealing tapes of Rene's ads to orchestrate rebuttals even before the originals air.

Ben Affleck fit old videotapes of the Iran hostage crisis into the state-of-the-art Hollywood photography of ""Argo."" Larrain tried a different strategy in ""No;"" he shot the entire film on Sony magnetic tape, the kind that was ubiquitous in 1980s news coverage. ""No,"" a much lower-budget film than ""Argo,"" obviously lack ""Argo's"" polish, but Larrain's choice means that the old footage from the Pinochet era fits seamlessly into the film as a whole, giving it a rare, gritty verisimilitude. However, ""Argo"" also seemed pretty seamless and truthful. Which strategy was better? You be the judge.

What is undeniable is that ""No"" is less polished as a whole than ""Argo,"" and not just in its photography. Some of Larrain's transitions from scene to scene are unduly abrupt, and he adds a coda to the film that dissipates the exciting triumph of the scenes just before it, though I understood why he included it.

Nevertheless, ""No"" is an admirable film. Its scrappiness deserves respect, as does its high-minded stand for democracy and plain dealing against tyranny and brutality.",1363478400,,2934,4.965376782077393
5531267,4,B00AZMFL2K,"No, a Chilean film directed by Pablo Larran from his screenplay of a play be Antonio Scarmeta, is an intruiging look at the role of advertising in the national plebiscite that ultimately restored Chile to democracy in 1988.

A little background is necessary for those unfamiliar with Chilean history. In 1973, a military coup led by army General Augusto Pinochet overthrew the democratically elected government of President Salvador Allende, a Socialist elected in 1970.  The military junta, headed by Pinochet, ruled Chile with an iron hand for the next sixteen years, bringing stability and economic progress for many but with the price of ruthless repression. International pressure eventually led the government to agree in 1988 to a plebiscite on Pinochet's rule.  The question was simple. A 'yes' vote would give Pinochet another eight years in power. A 'no' vote would mean that Pinochet was rejected and the government would have to hold elections and the new President and parliament would take power in early 1990.  (The entire situation was a lot more complicated but would require a much longer explanation that isn't really necessary to the context of the film).

The government had every reason to believe that they would win, given that the opposition consisted of a number of parties of differing political stripes united only by their desire to get rid of the junta.  Even the opposition didn't seem to really believe they could win, and many were only looking at the plebiscite as a means of making a symbolic protest.  But a handful of young Chileans, professionals in the field of advertising, thought differently.

The rules for the plebiscite is that each side - the government and the opposition - were allowed fifteen minutes of TV air time each night in the month leading up to the vote to make their case.  Led by Ren Saavedra (Gael Garca Bernal), this small group of professionals start shaping the opposition's ""No"" advertising campaign, finding ways to appeal to the broader spectrum of Chilean voters. At the same time, Ren's boss at the advertising company he works for, Luis ""Lucho"" Guzman (Alfredo Castro), is providing assistance to the government and their ""Yes"" campaign.

On a technical note, Larran shot No using low definition,  inch Sony U-matic magnetic tape which was widely used by television news in Chile in the 80s, giving it a very authentic look and feel appropriate to the period and also allowed Larrain's footage to mesh seamlessly with period footage of actual police crackdowns and pro-democracy demonstrations.

Highly recommended for anyone with an interest either in this period of Chilean history or in the considerable 'soft power' of advertising in political campaigns.",1363132800,2,2728,5.10561797752809

5531350,3,B00AZMFL2K,"I saw this movie on the big screen in the Enzian moviehouse -in Maitland, Florida- that had been rented out for the launch of the annual Winter With the Writers program, which Rollins College puts on every year. The novelist and screenwriter for the film, Antonio Skarmeta from Chile was present and kicked off the evening with his introduction. The premise or the reason for the film is a very big scale one, a full-scale revolution in Chile, deposing a dictatorship by giving oppressed people a hope for a new beginning, transmitted to them every evening on their televisions for one month. The people have been oppressed to the point where they have gotten used to it and accepted their lot in life. Now is the chance to find a new happiness? It seems unbelievable. How could this be real? The challenge is to help the people believe,""Yes, this can be real! You can be happy like you've never been before, and you can make it happen by voting NO at the upcoming elections."" They actually pray to God and ask for a miracle.
So ensues a campaign to refine a 15 minute video based on the soundtrack of a song called, ""Happiness Is Coming!"" intercut with varied images of ...you got it! happy people! liberated people enjoying their new freedom.
It must be said--that for me-- Marshall McLuhan's timeless theory still holds true:The Medium Is the Message. The medium in this case looks like super 8mm film. The screen is a super 8 mm box. It reminded me of some of the projects I did as a young man. They carry the visual by focusing constantly on the producer's serious looking face throughout (Gael Garcia Bernal) image wise and then holding it together with a slowly developing narrative soundtrack, interweaving TV style shots from actual event footage. Did they think the super 8 mm look would correspond with the TV footage? Having seen enough new wave movies my gut tells me this is a budget thing. So basically most of the movie has a super 8 millimeter documentary camera moving-around look. The five star quality that you would expect from the coverage of such a momentous event is only very well done when it comes to the music movie (looks like it was filmed in 16 mm). Indeed the shooting of the music movie and the music movie itself is the star of the show--yet interestingly enough it means very little outside of  the context of the lengthy, and somewhat hard to follow at times, narrative-dialogue. (The film is subtitled in English)
In the end it takes some effort and goodwill to follow the movie, and thankfully there were some excellent, and funny, scenes. Now a note to the people: Glad you voted NO for Happiness!",1454630400,,2636,4.644539614561028

5531448,4,B00AZMFL2K,"Based on the presidential referendum of 1988, called by Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet as a way of validating his 15-year regime, NO focuses on the campaign waged by those implacably opposed to his authoritarian rule.  A motley crew of idealists, Marxists, revolutionaries, those who suffered at the hands of police repression, they engage Ren (Gael Garcia Bernal), a hotshot advertising executive, to run their campaign.  Director Pablo Larrain highlights the contrast of values between them: the political supporters believe in the message, Ren in the medium.  Eventually they come up with a campaign based on the idea of happiness with the symbol of a rainbow.  What renders this film more complex is that Ren's boss Lucho (Alfredo Castro) is engaged on a consultancy basis by the rival ""Yes"" campaign: employee and employer are set against one another.  The film shows the power of propaganda; how Chile in the mid-Eighties managed to combine capitalist enterprise with repressive dictatorship to promote a favorable view of the world, which was very difficult to dislodge, given the power of the security services.  Combining documentary film footage and reconstructed action, shot in a deliberately fuzzy style, appropriate to mid-Eighties archive footage, the film offers an astute reflection on the power of politics and the role of capitalism within it.  The ending is both happy yet profoundly negative - while the No campaign emerges triumphant, this does not mean that the Chilean world necessarily changed.",1397606400,,1522,5.343096234309623

It does touch on the relationship between one man and his commitment to his family during that campaign, and brings a new light to the role of males, but that is a minor sub-plot.

The microwave symbolizes the new way of taking out a dictatorship, different from the traditional means of violence and death.  Imagine overthrowing a dictatorship without bloodshed and violence.  That is exactly the true meaning of the movie NO.  Overthrowing a dictatorship using the means of an advertising campaign through television.

The advertising campaign of NO united the people of Chile as would  demonstrations like riots and strikes would.  The advertising campaign however, was a bloodless means.  The advertising campaign united the people of Chile toward a common cause of change.

The campaign worked because it was not one single person who was the leader or represented the change, it was a cause.  It was all of the people together that made and represented the change.  The Pinochet Dictatorship could not make all of the people disappear at one time.  They had a history of imprisoning or making people disappear that represented a change for the present dictatorship.  But because the NO campaign represented all of the people of Chile, Pinochets government could not arrest or make everyone disappear.  Pinochets government could not stop an idea.  The more rough style dictatorship style strongman tactics they used, the stronger the NO campaign gained support.  This support for change eventually led to the overthrow of the Pinochet Dictatorship and the election of a new leader in Chile.

NO was a wonderful and entertaining movie that used a Microwave to symbolize an advertising campaign in which both led to changes in the way of life in Chile.

5531539,5,B00AZMFL2K,"General Pinochet came to power by a coup d'tat in 1973 when he overthrew the democratically elected government of President Allende's `Unidad' Popular party. Pinochet  was made President and de facto dictator heading a notorious junta that suppressed all opposition through fear, intimidation and murder, or `disappearances as they liked to call it. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher thought he walked on water after `supporting' her war to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentina. But enough of the potted history lesson and back to the film. The plot comes together in 1988 when after years of pressure El Presidente decided to hold a plebiscite on the future of dictatorship.

The question to be put to the people was simple, they were asked to vote yes or no; yes for more of the same and no for a democratic future. Everyone believed that it was a stitch up or that the junta was so far removed from reality having bought their own lies and propaganda that they could not lose so each side was given fifteen minutes a night to state their case, and then the fun began. This film from Pablo Larran (`Tony Manero' and `Post Mortem') continues his excellent career in making off the wall films that mix Chile's history with superb story telling and inspirational cinema. This stars the brilliant Gael Garcia Bernal as Renee Savadrea who is an advertising executive. He gets asked to head up the `no' campaign, but is more used to advertising fizzy drink commercials and initially says no to `no'.

The no campaign is a loose confederation of a rainbow alliance featuring all the unwelcomed politicos of Latin America, commies, etc. He soon gets pulled in to the irresistible urge to take part in something to redress the harm caused by dictatorship and soon finds himself at the centre of the campaign to bring down Pinochet. This inevitably makes him a tad unpopular with all the official agencies as his talent for an advert starts to win votes, and so does the anger aimed at him increase.

This is shot in a way that makes it look a bit dated and uses original footage from the time, mixed in with the film to create a brilliantly atmospheric and realistic feel. It comes across at times as docudrama, which in a way it actually is. The period attention to detail is excellent, Renee gets to drive a sports car of the day in the shape of a Renault Fuego, and God I remember those things, like a poor mans Ford Capri.

This is just glorious film making the way it should be. Every film that Larrain has made is stunningly brilliant and this just adds to his much deserved praise and thankfully he is now getting theatre runs outside of Chile including London, for which I am very grateful. It is in Spanish with good sub titles that occasionally mix with on screen writing, and has a run time of around 113 minutes. This is one film that I can not recommend highly enough; the only downside is I might have to wait a couple of years before Pablo Larrain gets to make another film.",1377216000,12,2987,4.628301886792453

In 1988, fifteen years into his reign as President of Chile, General Augusto Pinochet agreed to allow the people of his nation to hold a national referendum, leaving it up to them to determine whether or not they wanted him to remain as their leader for another eight years. On the surface, this might have seemed like a turn toward democracy for a man who came to power as a result of a military coup and who ruled his nation with an iron fist - sending many dissidents to prison and to their deaths - but many who were opposed to him eyed the elections with a great deal of skepticism and distrust, believing that the vote would be rigged and that his preordained victory would only further strengthen his grip on power and, simultaneously, enhance his image in the eyes of the world.

But hold the election the nation did, and it is against this backdrop that the movie ""No"" is set. Gael Garcia Bernal stars as Rene Saavedra, a divorced advertising executive who lives a profitable and comfortable life with his young son, Simon. Hitherto, he has remained largely apolitical in a country where to voice an opinion on the government or its leaders can put one's own life and freedom in jeopardy (his ex is herself a leftist activist who often finds herself abused and imprisoned for her actions).  But when the plebiscite is announced, Rene, somewhat hesitantly at first, agrees to work for the No Campaign, bringing his expertise on advertising for the first time into the realm of politics.

While most of the people involved in the campaign want to take this opportunity to expose the horrors of the regime through a hard-hitting series of 15-minute ads, Rene argues instead for a more upbeat, feel-good approach on the theory that people are more likely to respond positively to something that makes them feel happy than something that makes them feel outraged or depressed. The result is a series of TV spots so impossibly bland and innocuous - filled with deliriously happy performers dancing and singing a jingle - that they might as well be selling toothpaste. And I guess that's one of the points of ""No"" - that in a consumer-conscious society even freedom and democracy eventually become commodities like everything else and can be sold as such.

Written by Pedro Peirano and directed by Pablo Larrain, ""No"" is of more interest as a historical and social document than as a drama, since its characters remain largely superficial throughout. And while the narrative earns points for resisting the temptation to over-dramatize an already highly volatile situation, the perhaps inevitable price of that restraint is a picture that actually feels UNDER-dramatized at times. However, the bravery of these individuals in the face of some obvious attempts at intimidation does shine through. In order to more seamlessly blend the action of the story with actual archival footage from the era in which it`s set, the movie has been  given a deliberately grainy, over-lit appearance by cinematographer Sergio Armstrong that helps to heighten its authenticity.

Not quite as emotionally powerful as one might wish it to be, ""No"" is, nevertheless, a true-life tale of a national uprising well worth paying heed to.",1376697600,4,3222,4.900917431192661

Within that setting, the ""revolutionaries"" are viewed as bickering non-violent intellectuals lacking a coherent strategy.  The dictator's supporters are depicted as repulsive thugs.  The conflict between these two groups provides the dramatic thrust of the film and is very effective. Some pointed lessons on the philosophy of advertising and morality are also central to the plot.",1376265600,,540,5.62962962962963
5531563,4,B00AZMFL2K,"Filmed in a documentary-style and set when the events took place in 1988, ""No"" is an unusual film.  The title comes from a plebiscite called for in Chile to determine if dictator General Augusto Pinochet would continue his ruthless reign of 8 years.  A ""yes"" vote would continue his rule.  A ""no"" would not.  Pinochet had accepted the vote at the urging of the world community.  He was not worried about the outcome, until it was too late.

The film is about the advertising campaign created to get out the mostly hidden populace who would be expected to vote ""no.""  Pinochet's regime had agreed to telecast 15 minute ads each night.  One for the ""yes"" and one for the ""no.""  Political opposition had never had this opportunity but they were divided into various factions, each with their own agenda.  Most wanted to expose the criminal behavior of the dictator.

Rene Saavedra (Gael Garcia Bernal) is recruited from a top advertising agency to work for the ""no"" campaign.  He had done several ads for soft drink makers that were changing the way ads were made.  Younger, happier people were in the ads and he wanted something similar for the ""no's.""  As his ads became more successful, threats were made and the police state raised its ugly head, not to be missed of course by the general populace.

The film has a couple things going for it that make it stand out.  First is the decision to film documentary style.  This Blu ray transfer does a good job taking the filmmaker's choice of using older cameras to film which blends nicely with authentic news film of the era.  The film even displays in the 1.40:1 aspect ratio, close to the old standard definition televisions.  The second important aspect is the choice of Bernal.  He plays the ad man in a very low key and understated way.  Even when his child is threatened and his estranged wife is beaten by police, Rene maintains his cool.

The look of the Blu ray isn't what you would expect from high definition, but again this is the format the director chose.  The movie looks dated, bland and unexceptional, just as it was supposed to.  The audio isn't anything special either but with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is engaging and easily understood.  The Spanish language film comes with English, English SDH and French subtitles.  I'll also point out that the subtitles displayed on my Sansung plasma TV using an Oppo Blu ray player barely made it on the bottom of the screen.  I suspect this had something to do with the squarish aspect ratio.  Fortunately the Oppo has a feature that allows the subtitles to be moved up a bit.  Extra features are at a minimum.  There is an audio commentary featuring Bernal and director Pablo Larrain as well as a Q & A with Bernal, a trailer and some previews of Sony movies.",1376092800,3,2775,4.615541922290388

5531571,3,B00AZMFL2K,"""No"" manages to do the almost impossible - turn a pivotal moment of history into a humdrum tale with flat characters. In 1988, under increasing international pressure, Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet agreed to a national plebiscite on whether he should be allowed to stay in power for another eight years. Chileans were given the chance to vote Yes or No and each side was given 15 minutes a day on national television. Even though the anti-Pinochet forces were convinced the referendum was a fraud and the Yes side would win, they decided to make use of their 15 minutes each day to give voice to an opposition that had been largely silenced since Pinochet took over in a 1973 coup and then crushed dissenting voices.

  The main problem with ""No"" is a drifting flat performance by actor Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal, who plays the lead character Rene, a successful advertising executive who happens to sympathise with the ""No"" side. He is persuaded to come on board and insists on using upbeat and funny adverts (or so we are told) to persuade Chileans they can vote out Pinochet. Rene has a young son by a woman he doesn't live with and as the ""No"" campaign picks up speed, he starts to get threats. There is little sense of suspense though and only towards the very end do we see some of the humour we have been promised in the ""No"" adverts. We are shown some of the real ads and also the clunky dreadful commercials the ""Yes"" side produced, as well as clips from the time showing Pinochet in various poses. The ending, where the No side wins, is a complete anti-climax and the final scene is of Rene back at work, as though nothing had happened. The clunky script and unconvincing performance means he remains a two-dimensional mystery and as a result, ""No"" falls seriously short of what it could and should have been.",1374451200,5,1822,4.634674922600619

5531608,5,B00AZMFL2K,"""With a title as simple as No, you would not know what to expect but the film is particularly grand-scale in the examination of politics, media, history, and sociology though.

No, starring Gael Garcia Bernal, deals with a tumultous time in Chilean history where Augusto Pinochet maybe booted out of power with the thanks of UN cooperation and a strong, quirky grassroots political campaign that allows doubtful voters to vote ""NO"" on his controversial political regime. The film is particularly dense and has a particularly liberal slant but it is well-bodied, engaging, provocative, and challenging to the point where turning away one second would make you miss all the great things that No, the film, has to offer.

Among the many pluses especially credit to the adapted script from its unsourced play, Bernal's believable yet stern performance as a quiet mastermind of the advertising scheme of the campaign, many of the film's themes, and the unbelievably well-done cinematography which is rendered to make the film look like it was from the 1980s (grainy film, 3D shimmer effects, titling and credits, and set pieces/clothing) and made for TV. Very artistic yet very political and motivated in its own stance. The film does not enforce the audience to take a particular side but to view, from a wide and rather neutral lens, the issues that arise when the media tries to consult its public, personal emotions, the government, and the censorship boards to come up with the most effective piece of campaigning possible.

It is more engaging than a standard Hollywood drama based on real events in that it does not enforce overtly sentimental ideas or imagery across you but showcases horror and political turmoil in a clinical and rather critical light. The moments where Bernal's character plays with his son and deals with his separated wife feel raw and make you feel compassion and disgust for his isolated persona. In addition, the way the characters convey themselves are grounded much in reality and the cinematography approaches its subjects much like documentary (with the style that it is going with here).

A similarly motivated film, Argo, has much in common with No but Argo suffers from elements of being a little typical of a Hollywood thriller (with its opening and ending) and the excess hype it received at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes.

Thankfully, No does not disappoint and never will especially to those who have a cultural palette and appreciate or are studying advertising, media studies (more importantly in a university course/major like that), and/or Latin American history. If there is one political film people must see back in 2012 or 2013, it is a ""yes"" for No.""",1373760000,6,2706,5.03125
5531609,4,B00AZMFL2K,"Back in 2006, Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larrain received critical acclaim for his film ""Fuga"", followed my success with two more films, ""Tony Manero"" and ""Post Mortem"".

But having grown up in a political family tied to the right wing, Larrain had nothing in common with the right and considered himself anti-Pinochet (August Pinoche was an army general and dictator of Chile from 1973 to 1981).

Larrain felt that with Augusto Pinochet in power, the Pinochet government was responsible for destroying culture and writers and artists were persecuted under his dictatorship.

But in 1988, a Chilean national plebiscite (a referendum on whether President Augusto Pinochet should remain in office for another eight years) was held and during that time, for 27 nights, those who supported or were against Pinochet would have 15 minutes per night to present their point of view and get people to vote.

For this unprecedented election in Chile, it would become the source for Pablo Larrain's fourth film titled ""No"" starring Mexican film actor and director Gael Garcia Bernal (""Y tu mama tambien"", ""The Motorcycle Diaries"", ""Babel"").  The film would be nominated for a ""Best Foreign Language Film"" at the 85th Academy Awards.

The 2012 film takes place in 1988 and a Chilean national plebiscite is to be held.  Rene Saavedra (portrayed by Gael Garcia Bernal) is a successful advertisement director approached by the ""No"" side for consultation of their 15-minute advertising spots that would air on television for 27 nights, meanwhile his boss who is conservative wants him to be in charge of the ""Yes"" campaign and in return he would get a major account and make a lot of money.

Raising a son named Simone by himself, while his ex is with another man and often getting in trouble with the law as an activist, after seeing her beaten by law officials, he is more determined to consult the ""No"" advertising committee.

And in the beginning, the committee is more interested in showing how many people were tortured, how many people were incarcerated and the tyranny in the Pinochet dictatorship but Rene feels this is not the way to get people to vote.  He proposes a more upbeat promotional approach in order to entice people to vote.

But all is not well as the opposition tries to intimidate Rene and let them know they are watching his family.  But even with acts of trying to intimidate Rene, he is more determined in creating an advertising campaign that will lead people to vote against Pinochet.  But what kind of marketing campaign will he come up with?

VIDEO:

""No"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:40:1).  It's important to note that for this film, cinematographer Sergio Armstrong used a 1983 U-Matic video camera because it was instrumental to blend the archival footage to the film and make it feel realistic.

In an interview with ""Bring the Noise UK"", Pablo Larrain said, ""Every time I see a movie that has archive footage in the middle mixed, you can immediately tell, and it kills my illusion. It's like you're watching something and it has a film star shot in super 35mm, or high end HD, and then you cut to this old video format or stock footage and it just looks so different.""

So, the way the film was shot made it look like it was shot in the '80s.  The film was not made to look fantastic in HD but to make sure the film and its archived footage blend well together and because of that, I do feel that Pablo Larrain and Sergio Armstrong managed to capture the era and blend both archived footage and modern footage shot with the U-Matic with efficacy.
Every time I see a movie that has archive footage in the middle mixed, you can immediately tell, and it kills my illusion. It's like you're watching something and it has a film star shot in super 35mm, or high end HD, and then you cut to this old video format or stock footage and it just looks so different. - See more at: [...]

JUDGMENT CALL:

Typically when you watch political cinema in regards to an election, it tends to focus on strategies employed by both opposition parties.

From D.A Pennebaker's documentary ""The War Room"" to films such as ""The Contender"", ""Election"", ""Wag the Dog"", it's primarily party-driven.

So, for Pablo Larrain to create a film that revolves around the marketing campaign during the 1988 Chilean national plebiscite, I found it quite intriguing because while these elections were featured on the news, I had no idea what kind of marketing campaign was used by the opposition against Army General Augusto Pinochet.

While we see the ""Rock the Vote"" campaigns in the U.S. bringing together celebrities and music artists to target the younger demographic, in Chile, they knew that those who weren't sure they were going to vote were 60-year-old women and the younger voters.

Through research, they knew that older voters have been through the worst.  They have seen the worst and possibly knew of people who have experienced the worse from Pinochet's government.  But at the same time, they are reluctant to vote, thinking that the election may be a scam, that the government would find a way to tamper with the voting system or even get them into trouble.

So, for the character of Rene Saavedra, a savvy advertising creator, he knew that he needed to reach out to these voters, not with the depressing or hard hitting facts of Pinochet's government but to use celebrities, music and excitement that would get people to vote and make voting seem ""cool"", especially as opposition to Pinochet's government.

Despite  the intimidation tactics used by those in support of Pinochet's government, the film focuses on Rene Saavedra's  team employing tactics to shift public sympathy for the no-campaign.  And what they come up with is fascinating and well-executed.

While the film received international acclaim, in Chile, the film did receive criticism for focusing too much on the marketing campaign.  Genaro Arriagada who directed the ""No"" campaign felt there was too much focus on the advertising campaign and not the grassroot voter registration.  But for filmmaker Pablo Larrain, he defended the film as art not a documentary.

While I felt the film was smart, I felt the use of the U-Matic video camera was creative and added to the believability and enjoyability of the film.  I agree with Pablo Larrain that when you watch a documentary or a film that takes place in an era and the archived footage during these years of HD makes it seem unnatural, by going this direction for the film, I felt that Pablo Larrain was doing a great service to show that by using an older camera and achieving the look of the '80s to go with the archived footage, worked to the film's favor.

So, for this Blu-ray release, one should not approach the film expecting clear-cut detailed HD but expect a film that was capturing a look and feel of the '80s where its archived footage would matchup to what you see in the film.  Lossless audio was good but primarily dialogue driven as is expected with this film.  And you get an audio commentary and Q&A segment for special features.

Overall, it was great to see a film that focused on strategy, employment of tactics and a film that was intellectual and fascinating. Pablo Larrain's ""No"" is smart, creative and a film that I recommend!",1372896000,3,8256,4.791666666666667

5531612,4,B00AZMFL2K,"The close examination of the 1988 referendum campaign called for by Chile's military dictator Augusto Pinochet provides not only a fascinating peak inside politics, but it also is a true story of how the Chilean people successfully staged a bloodless revolution to free themselves from the power of a dictator. Based on fact as depicted in a play written by Antonio Skrmeta, molded into a screenplay by Pedro Peirano,and directed with a keen sense of period by Pablo Larran, the film uses substantial bits of archival film footage that enhances the impact of this moment in history.

NO is the story of the advertising campaign surrounding the 1988 referendum that was supposed to `elect' General Pinochet to another eight years of dictatorship in Chile. The referendum campaign will last 27 days leading up to the October 5, 1988 vote, with each side getting fifteen minutes of uninterrupted television air time each day for their campaign. The ""no"" coalition decides to hire Ren Saavedra (Gael Garca Bernal), a young, brash, in demand  advertising executive to spearhead their campaign, which causes problems if only because his boss, Lucho Guzmn (Alfredo Castro), is an advisor to Pinochet. Saavedra's troubled home life  - his ex-wife Vernica Carvajal (Antonia Zegers) believes the referendum is simply Pinochet propaganda and shares custody of their son Simon (Pascal Montero) - interferes with Ren's focus, but he eventually devises a plan to spearhead the NO campaign by putting a positive, consumerist spin on it with plenty of humor to be had. Instead of reminding the Chileans of the horrors of Pinochet's reign he instead infuses the campaign to unseat Pinochet with symbols of rainbows, hope and the happiness that the people can enjoy if they vote to end the dictatorship. In the end, despite the attempted disruption of the campaign by the YES campaign that want to re-seat Pinochet for another 8 years, the people's revolution slogan of `Chile: happiness is coming!' is a bloodless lesson for the world that revolution can come form the hearts of the people instead of being the result of bloody battles.

Gael Garca Bernal shines in  his understated portrayal of Ren Saavedra , a fact that makes his intelligent media focused mind more appreciated.  If at times he seems physically uncommitted to the campaign at hand that only reinforces how he used his mind instead of brawn to accomplish is assignment. There are moments of tenderness, frightening scenes of the cruelties form the Pinochet dictatorship brutal rise to power, and all of this is blended with filmed archives and in the moment film that result in an intelligent and empathetic film.

In this film, he plays a brash ad executive, Rene Saavedra, hired to represent the No contingent in the referendum whether or not to allow Chilean dictator Pinochet to remain in power. The film also stars the powerhouses Alfredo Castro, Luis Gnecco, and Antonia Zegeres. The scenes of the ad campaign are sometimes hilarious. The secondary plot is that one of the No influencers is secretly working for the Yes. Rene does childhood activities--skateboarding and model trains. Pinochet goons try to frighten Rene by threatening harm to his son. As the campaigns end, there is a riot instigated by the government to try to discredit the No. The young actor who plays the ad executive's son is wonderful. When it is announced that the No has won, Rene is deflated, despite the victory, because he knows at what cost it came. He carries his son through the city.
