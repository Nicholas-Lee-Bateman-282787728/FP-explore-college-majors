6391708,4,B00JVSF0T8,"I have always been a fan of Leslie Mann, ever since her turn as Matthew Broderick's love interest in 1996's ""The Cable Guy"". She is inherently cute and charming. She's the kind of actress that no matter what she is doing, you can't help but love her. While her characters from movie to movie don't tend to vary all that much, she is still absolutely perfect in ""The Other Woman"".

 Mann plays Kate King, the wife of a multi-million dollar business start-up expert. Her husband is always travelling and if you paid to see the movie or in the least read the title of the movie, you most certainly know what is going to happen. Insert Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz), who thinks she's met the man of her dreams and Amber (supermodel Kate Upton), who joins the shenanigans as well.

 The thing about ""The Other Woman"" is that if you know anything about the movie and/or have seen the trailer, you pretty much know everything there is to know about it, except for how it ends. That is probably the biggest downfall of the movie. The movie isn't all that complicated once the relationships are all exposed. Also, there are a few too many montage and music video moments that would have been better served with just natural sound, especially an emotional and important scene near the end. A scene on a beach between friends, instead of making a music video, would have best been served with natural sound of the ocean waves and just the general quietness of frienship; but people love music videos these days and who am I?

 On the good side, ""The Other Woman"" may have its problems with simplicity, but it goes miles upon miles upon the charm of its stars. Mann, Diaz and Upton are electric together. The scenes that they spend together bantering are extremely realistic and natural. There wasn't a single moment watching them that I pondered upon the fact that they were just acting; even Upton, who's only played bit parts in two other movies. They were like sisters and it came across.

 Personality goes a long way with me in movies because it is those things that we connect with and relate to as an audience. While this may primarily be a movie that takes man bashing to a new extreme, anybody who has been in a fidelity situation will relate. Leslie Mann makes this movie worth viewing in her own right. If you don't ride along with her emotional roller coaster and fall in love with her, you don't have a pulse.",1398384000,3,2410,4.549653579676674
6391709,5,B00JVSF0T8,"Chick Flick Alert! No one can do them better than director Nick Cassevetes (""The Notebook"") when he's in the mood. Working with writer Melissa Stack in her first full-length project (I'll keep an eye out for this talented gal), this pair knows how to deliver a punch straight to where we live. This guilty pleasure is a perfect showcase for the hilarious Leslie Mann and the fearless Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (in a wild departure from ""Game of Thrones""), but the others are laugh-out-loud funny, too.

Being a successful lady killer can have its perils when the ladies involved are:
  * Cameron Diaz (""Bad Teacher"") as Carly, as successful attorney betrayed by her lover...
  * Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (""Headhunters"") Mark, who is the irresistibly handsome Lothario married to...
  * Leslie Mann (""This is 40"") Kate. After an initial rough patch, the wife and the mistress quickly discover that he is also courting...
  * Kate Upton (""Tower Heist"") Amber, who feels betrayed when a fourth woman is spotted being seduced by this three-timer.
  * Nicki Minaj (""Ice Age"" voice) is Lydia, the brassy secretary who tells Carly that ""liars live longer.""
  * Don Johnson (""Machete"") is Carly's proud father, often married, rarely sorry.

It is clear that we are in good hands when the movie opens with a gorgeous aerial shot of New York City and Etta James singing ""I Want a Sunday Kind of Love."" ...sigh...

Rated PG-13, you will see no nudity and hear no profanity, but there are several segments where the women get drunk together. I have never seen such terrific physical comedy that features women! I'll buy the DVD from Amazon as soon as it's available because I know there were whole chunks of the witty dialogue that got by me.",1398384000,2,1723,4.852739726027397

6391825,1,B00JVSF0T8,"I had a hard time watching this movie. It's one thing to be a teenage comedy or a mediocre Adam Sandler flick and fill it with juvenile pranks and potty jokes, it's another when 40 something women play potty humor jokes. Adam Sandler can get away with it because most of his movies are crap and everyone knows it when they buy the ticket. However Cameron Diaz just seems out of place for these kinds of roles at her current age.

With so many better femme fatale comedy films out there (I'd take Charlie's Angels featurng Cameron Diaz anyday over this dumb movie), you should rent something else. Don't waste for time with this flick.",1499299200,,634,4.51304347826087

6391865,3,B00JVSF0T8,"I enjoyed it.  It was amusing with an occasional  laugh.  I'd probably go 3-1/2 stars.  So, if you like the people and premise you'd probably enjoy it's entertainment value.  That being said, it suffers from the disease a lot of these smaller comedies, rom-coms, even thrillers and action films suffer from.  The makers get a good idea full of possibilities, brainstorm possible 'bits' and pieces, get a star or stars attached to the premise, get the money, and film the outline of the script without ever building a truly integrated, connected story, without ever enlarging on the bits and pieces or linking them together to their full advantage, without ever taking the ideas to a unified whole or a script that is really fun and satisfying.  After watching a film like this, I'm amused but I find myself inevitably rewriting the script mentally to integrate the 'bits' and enlarge the relationships and just do more with what could have been a minor classic comedy.  (Note to director:  Next time ditch the dog who served absolutely no purpose whatever and wasted time.  Spend more time on scripts and less on livestock.  Just a thought.)",1489968000,,1141,4.860103626943006

6391867,1,B00JVSF0T8,The movie is funny enough when you are in the mood for a light comedy.  The problem is that the Bluray DVD does not line up the audio with the action on the screen.  This is very annoying as you watch the characters movements on the screen and hear the corresponding sounds approximately 1 second later.  It is like watching a poorly dubbed foreign film.,1488931200,,354,4.415384615384616

6391959,5,B00JVSF0T8,"Following my engagement, I bought my husband to be a collection of wedding themed movies. In the years we were dating, we went to the movies on an almost weekly basis. Leading up the wedding, movies got pushed aside to save money and save time planning.

The Other Woman is a lighthearted, sarcastic film about a group of women who find out they are being played by the same man. Although this isn't the best movie to get psyched for a wedding, this was a movie my husband and I saw while we were dating and is fun and light hearted. This was a great film to put on in the background while working on our own wedding planning. It is laugh out loud funny. Only in Hollywood does a scorned wife befriend her husbands mistresses for revenge! Sense of Humor Required to enjoy this too outlandish to be true film!

6391965,4,B00JVSF0T8,"Was a good movie, the women really likeable and the friendship they had seemed real. I liked the brother, the father, the ocean scenes and the movie itself. What I didn't understand is that if this movie was made in 2104 how she (jilted #1), an intelligent lawyer didn't google him, Facebook him, find out her was married. That part just seemed to make the movie less credible. But enjoyed it.",1475193600,,393,4.549295774647887
6391966,3,B00JVSF0T8,"I loved watching Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann in this movie.  They did a great job.  The story line was also good.  The scenery was good.  But, strung throughout the movie was crude, over-the-top sort humor (Adam Sandler style).  It is sort of like this movie had an identity crisis.  At times, it had none of this crass humor.  But especially late in the movie, there was quiet a bit.  Luckily, the ladies of this film were not heavily involved in the cruddy humor.  It was mostly the main man of the film and used mostly to show he was an idiot.  Will I watch this movie again?  Yes...the women were wonderful.  Will I skip through some parts?  Absolutely.",1475193600,,658,4.428571428571429

6392061,5,B00JVSF0T8,"I found the movie beyond entertaining! I like movies for their escape from reality. The Other Woman is the ultimate escape!

Synopsis: The plot consists of a wife, Kate (Leslie Mann), finding out her husband, Mark King (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), has been cheating on her with girlfriend, Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz). At first she is confused and sad, but soon anger kicks in and with it, revenge. Revenge for not only her, but the other two women, Carly and another woman (Kate Upton) who have been fooled by Mark.

Review:
What I liked:
Women kicking ass and taking names
Love story
Great lines and tons of laughs
Beautiful ending

What I didn't like:
A little cheesy
Obvious plot

However, I didn't mind the cheesy and the plot was meant to be obvious. This is not a mystery movie it's a nice, funny, escape from reality.",1468281600,4,822,4.6875

6392082,5,B00JVSF0T8,"Cameron Diaz may get top billing but Leslie Mann steals the show. Not that Cameron was bad. The interplay between Diaz and Mann was really good. But Leslie Mann is a comedic genius, I was laughing in just about every time I she was on screen.  The scene where Diaz is trying to stuff her into a cab, I thought I was going to die. In an age where movies try to pass off crude humor as comedy (Bachelor Party, Bridesmaids), this movie shows them how it's done. There are very few movies I tell friends/family they have to watch, this is one of them.",1466380800,,547,4.20952380952381

She always has a weird crying breakdown scene in every movie, and her characters are usually really insecure.  Actually, I think I made up my mind and I don't like how she portrays women as overly emotional.

Though I would call it a guilty pleasure because it was also pretty trashy, considering the entire plot revolved around a bunch of women having sex with the same man.

True to comedy, it was light hearted throughout with unrealistic moments, but it had a couple of pretty realistic moments, i.e. Leslie Mann drunk & when she goes off plan (not a spoiler).
On another note, I was pleasantly surprised by Nikki Minaj's acting chops. Her portrayal of the character added flavor to the movie.

6392129,1,B00JVSF0T8,"I have never rated a movie on Amazon, but I sincerely felt like I needed to express my opinion for this on.

I though the dialogue was awful. Conversations felt forced and unnatural. I kept imagining people on the set during filming cringing as the actors delivered their lines.

The characters had no depth, even for a ""romantic"" comedy (that's the closest thing I can think of to describe this genre, but there was no romance). The women were stereotypically ditsy, and the ""strong female lead"" (Cameron Diaz) was annoyingly shallow and petty.

I was thoroughly confused by the last scene when the guy walks into the glass door and immediately gets a bloody nose, which is smeared across the wall and his face. What the hell? That serves no purpose, and it makes no sense. Then he walks into another glass wall and completely shatters the entire glass section? That did me in. I can't stand this movie now.",1463875200,,908,4.6625

6392263,5,B00JVSF0T8,"Sooooo, yeah... I laughed way more than I should have, and then was angry because honestly... HOW can a woman NOT annihilate her husband knowing he was having an affair? It took a while, but I did love the revenge...
Much of the early humor comes from Kate being a pest to become friends with Carly, when all Carly wants to do is distance herself from the whole thing. Then later there is a great scene of bathroom humor after Mark gets slipped some strong laxative in a restaurant. Then later when he is confronted by the three women in a conference room of the law offices. He plays the physical comedy very well.
And I AM also glad to say that I AM SO GLAD DON JOHNSON ISN'T DEAD! I dunno why I thought he was, but I laughed as soon as I saw him...It was nice seeing Don Johnson with a small part as Carly's 5-time divorced dad, who incidentally at the end ends up with Amber. And a curiosity is Nicki Minaj as Lydia, Carly's law office assistant. Minaj seems like a natural actress and did her part very well, but that nasal vocal delivery of hers is very, very annoying. And man does she have a big butt for a small girl! Hahahahaaaa",1454284800,5,1138,4.248847926267281

All that said, it's still a stupid, fun movie. The three women develop an unlikely friendship out of a terrible situation and it's fun to watch it develop. There are a lot of cheap laughs and silly fun that keep you entertained the whole time. And the end, which I won't spoil, is everything one would hope for.

Three main actors were ok and their relationship in the movie was good.

6392411,1,B00JVSF0T8,"Sold as a female empowerment movie, this movie focuses on anything but. The girls focus obsessively on the cheating husband, rather than taking legal action and moving on with their lives. There's even a section of the movie dedicated to Kate Upton's bouncing breasts, which is odd for a female-centric movie. The incessant stupidity exhibited by all of the female leads, especially from Leslie Mann (and her unbearable whining) actually end up making you cheer for the antagonist, which is... kinda sad. I actually felt for the guy, as being married to Leslie Mann would be intolerable. It doesn't justify cheating, but she is the absolute worst.

Ladies, I know you think you love the movie. But give it a second thought, and you'll realize just how insulting this movie is. Do the right thing and downvote, so you can discourage people from making such low quality garbage in the future.

6392427,4,B00JVSF0T8,This was a good movie. It keeps you interested from start to finish. During some part of the movie you can't help but think how pitiful the main character is and how much she is willing to stay with someone who has strange ways when it comes to other women. The women did a great job acting and some of the scenes were absolutely stunning.,1438732800,,339,4.230769230769231
6392428,2,B00JVSF0T8,"There is no doubt that Cameron Diaz has bountiful charisma, but it didn't work for her in this film.  She plays a lawyer, Carly Whitten, who discovers that her handsome boyfriend, played by Game of Thrones's actor, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, has a wife.  It is also maddening that he is cheating on both of them.  And even on his other mistress.

The wife is played by the usually lovable Leslie Mann. I like her, had great hope for her, but she warped all my hope and faith.  She is shrill and whiny in this film.  Worst of all, she is desperate, and she wants to befriend her husband's mistress.  I never thought Leslie Mann was a bad actress, but even Kate Upton proves more competent.  Just Leslie Mann's voice was like nails having a criminal way with a chalkboard.

Kate Upton tries to act; and she is awkward and even timid.  I know Kate Upton is gorgeous.  In fact, I am totally envious of her body, especially in those Sports Illustrated photographs, but the camera doesn't love her as much as still photo.  She appears heavy and mundane and even plain.  In fact, her acting is actually better than her looks.  Due to the lack of caliber of the film, Kate Upton surprisingly strikes just the right note.  She approaches her role tentatively, appropriately embarrassed, and almost appearing as a nugatory, as if she does not want to be involved.  Her alleged union with the decrepit Don Johnson was just right - a union formed by Hollywood, which totally grossed her out - but you see her grin and try.  No one bought it, because it could not be bought.  And for the audience, even those who were older than Don Johnson when he appeared on Miami Vice and should be smitten, the union was creepy at best.  Not because of age, but because the film did nothing to show why Don Johnson was covetable.  In fact, it made him appear older than he was - if you want to talk about age.  Poor Kate Upton.  Her character appeared both damaged and exhibited serious issues - not daddy issues but those of a more perverse nature, as her delight in Don Johnson's character proved.  It never worked.  It could not worked.  Poor girl.  How many caseworkers in the Department of Social Services were crying to save her?

Cameron Diaz comes off too sentimental, stupid, and sincere, and Leslie Mann appears ridiculous with her peculiar squeaks.  You can't fathom why Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's character would ever have been interested in his wife.  Leslie Mann fails her purpose, because she has no warmth, and therefore, shows no empathy.  Screw principle, you need belief.  Leslie Mann/Kate King had no interesting qualities, or respectable talents, or looks that would seduce her husband.  In fact, I was struggling where the attraction could lie.  Let's go further.  She possessed nothing that would attract any man, except the most psychotic features.  She has an humdrum personality that allows others to pity her husband for his patience.  There was nothing to attract him to her.  Because there was nothing about her that attracted, you had to give him some latitude for marrying her.  It is an outright assault to both his character and the sanctity of marriage that he married her.  I was offended.  I actually sympathized with him.

I don't dislike Cameron Diaz, and she is still young, but she looked horrible in this film.  It was like the sun hit with her laser, like the sole focus on her.  She was deplete of color, just bounding around with this horrid aging face.  The groves on her face were especially prominent, and her skin appeared like a spoilt sagging stomach.  She looked horrid.  Not even attractive.

This film is entertaining, and you root for the jilted ladies, but oddly enough, only Nikolaj Coster-Waldau comes off unscathed.  Yes, at times, he looks ridiculous, but he seems to acknowledge this film is in the vein of Naked Gun.  He is the only one to emerge from this film with some modicum of class.  And ever appear attractive.",1438646400,,3947,4.682215743440233

The other actors who played smaller roles will be recognized and were real and played their parts well. A cameo or two with Don Johnson spiced it up. Sexy, clever, enjoyable to watch.

I felt like it delivered a pretty funny story even though at times it seemed like they were really stretching to piece it all together.  I really liked the example that Cameron Diez's character gave as a woman who would never date a married man.  She was good example of how to be a strong woman, while still being open to also needing to learn a lesson herself.

This comedy follows three women - Carly,Kate and Amber - who are all romantically involved with the same man,Mark. After finding out about it,they all decide to take revenge on their womanizing and lying man. The screenplay was written by Melissa Stack and it was directed by Nick Cassavetes.

The movie boasts of a talented cast. Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann manage to elicit lots of laughter in a lot of scenes. They basically carried to movie from beginning to end and had a lot of wonderful and funny scenes together. Too bad that Kate Upton was somewhat underused except to show her curves and big boobs in the beach. As for the story,it was definitely far from original and refreshing but nevertheless it would not disappoint viewers who are want a movie that has lots of funny scenes.",1431388800,,919,4.853503184713376

6392539,4,B00JVSF0T8,"The Other Woman
 The Other Woman delivers more laughs to our faces than any chick flick since Bridesmaids.  Writer Melissa Stack brings us into the lives of three very different women who are involved with the same man.  She also brings us into the minds of the women, to the amazement and terror of male audience members and the wise knowing nods of female audience members.  There is just enough real life resonance in the characters to make us laugh, or wince and then laugh.  As a young friend of mine once told me it isn't easy being a girl or a grown up woman for that matter.  But it can be funny.
 Writer Melissa Stack gives us her very first big screen script.  Im betting that it will not be her last.  The Other Woman has all the markings of becoming a big hit.
 I am pleased to see another cast member of Game of Thrones get a different acting job, in this case Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.  Danish born, 43 year old Coster-Waldau plays Mark King, a nogoodnik.  Mark is a cheater.  He cheats his business partners.  He also cheats on his wife Kate, played with psychotic vulnerability by the accomplished Leslie Mann.  We know Mann for her roles in the light weight comedies This is 40, 17 Again and George of the Jungle.  Kate King has a protected suburban life and cannot cope with the destruction of her comfortable little world.  The house wife cannot hold her booze either, which gives rise to a number of great sequences.
 The actress that I consider to be the best physical comedian working today is Cameron Diaz.  She plays Carly Whitten, a very together, focused New York attorney, a woman alone but living her life with verve and style.  She becomes involved in a torrid romance with Mark, not knowing that he is a married man.  Diaz has the funniest sight gag of the movie.  Some of the lines the actresses speak can only have been written by a woman.  There is a savage practicality swirling around in a hormonal soup of utter randomness that no man could hope to duplicate.  But we can appreciate and laugh along with them.
 Kate Upton, the spectacular 21 year old photo model from the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue plays Amber, a much younger women who also comes under the spell of the serpent tongued Mark King.  Mark seems to be able to talk women into anything.  Of course being handsome and Danish, Coster-Waldau brings it off.  This is Uptons third big screen role after a small role at age 18 in Tower Heist and another small role in The Three Stooges a year later.  She is not an actress but she has a relationship with the camera that should not be underestimated.  A good director like Nick Cassavetes can direct around her shortcomings.  He lets her speak infrequently and lets her just be a very nice very pretty girl.
 The best stuff and the stuff that unleashes Coster-Waldau to the max are the devilish methods of revenge that the trio of shamed women wreaks on Mark.

 Director Nick Cassavetes has Diaz to work with and a great script.  He is best known for his many roles as an actor.  But he has directed such noted films as John Q and Alpha Dog, not exactly comedies.  He also wrote the screenplay for Blow, an intense look at cocaine smugglers starring Johnny Depp.  He also wrote Alpha Dog.  Cassavetes directs a workman like film with professionalism.  He doesnt make himself as the director the focus of the movie; he steps aside and lets the actors act.  Except of course for Upton, who he sort of shoots around.
 Also appearing are Don Johnson who plays a charming role as the Diaz characters philandering dad and Taylor Kinney as a nice, solid guy who unaccountably is available to fall for Diaz when the time is ripe.  Singer Nicki Minaj also has a small role but we watch her every moment she is on screen.  She is funny too, and it isn't just her constantly changing wigs that make her so.
 My friends and I laughed through The Other Woman.  It rates a strong three and a half saw blades.  The PG-13 rated comedy lasts one hour and 49 minutes.  It opened at number one over the weekend bumping out Captain America.  The film has a $40 million budget and brought in $45 million worldwide in three days.  People will want to see it and laugh.",1430179200,,4193,4.481481481481482

Obviously I bought it anyway! Why? Well, because it's just plain fun and it's great to see a cheating jerk of a guy get exactly what he deserves. Cameron Diaz plays Carly, a woman who finds out the guy she's dating is married - when she goes to his house to ""help"" with a plumbing problem and the woman who answers the door is not the guy's housekeeper, but his wife, Kate. Oh, oh! Anyway, Kate isn't stupid and figures things out, so kind of stalks Carly, and the end up bonding. Carly promised not to see him again but Kate hears him on the phone making lovey dovey comments to someone so she thinks Carly lied. She confronts Carly and they figure out that there must be someone else - that he's cheating on both of them! Well, they tail him and find Amber. Ultimately Amber bonds with Kate and Carly, and they decide to really get him! And boy, do they! This movie shows a perfect example of what to do about a cheating husband - don't get mad, get even!",1427500800,2,1152,4.079295154185022

The music is very catchy............where the heck is the soundtrack????  Who doesn't want to see the cheating husband get his just rewards?  I happen to love Leslie Mann in all her roles, and this is a great role for Leslie Mann as ""cute Kate""  Cameron Diaz can do comedy pretty well.  And Kate Upton?  Well hello, we all know why Kate Upton was cast as Amber.  Watch this when you have a girls night with wine or Margaritas. Or..........if you are too embarrassed, when your husband or significant other goes out of town.

It reminded me of the movie ""Chasing Papi"" which is also one of the funniest movies ever.  I loved that the women were all completely different from each other but came together over a shared betrayal by the man.  I love that Leslie Mann.  She's funny just standing still.  And it was great to see these women....all beautiful......play sort of outside their beauty in that it became so much more than just being pretty.  The slapstick worked and the actresses gave themselves over to the comedy.  It just got better and better w/a great ending that tied things together.  And it was fun to see Nikki Minaj as Cameron Diaz's secretary giving out 'sage' advice.  LOL!!!  The power of WOMEN!  We're awesome.  This was waaaaaay better than Bridesmaids!

I have always been a Diaz fan and in my opinion this is one of her beset roles and Leslie Mann is just amazing in her part. This is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over to see its many hilarious scenes. All three actresses are fantastic and what makes this movie so great is the fact that they play off each other so well its almost magical to watch and it makes you wish you were really friends with them. I also love the guy in this movie because I am a Game of Thrones fan and this shows off his funny side, with some of the funniest scenes featuring him. At one point his character ends up being stuck in a bathroom stall after being slipped a laxative by his date which is the best """"bathroom incident"""" I have seen and it only gets funnier from there..... a must watch and I promise you will laugh until you cry.",1424476800,,1001,3.985074626865672

Then, I watched it a second time with my husband (he has a pretty open mind when it comes to movies) and it was definitely not his favorite. It's a cute movie with great actors and humor that really caters to women, and really bashes hard on the male race. So I totally understand why it's not the best movie for the men to go see with their ladies.
If this ends up playing on TV in the future, there will be no hesitation to me watching it. I would compare it to Bridesmaids in humor, but slightly more chick flicky.",1423958400,,647,4.225806451612903

I'd have preferred much more of newcomer Kate Upton and the gratuitously used Don Johnson and Nikki Minaj. They at least had somewhat funny roles in the movie.

Plus the scene where the man in question who's the one fooling around gets confronted by the three amigettes is beyond cruel. I mean, what was up with having him (SPOILER ALERT) get his face torn to ribbons by a glass partition. The movie just seemed to have given up at that point.

6392751,3,B00JVSF0T8,"Director Nick Cassavetes and writer Melissa seem to have jumped on the 'Hangover 1 - 3' etc line of thinking and made a film that tries very hard to make having numerous mistresses seem a thousand laughs. If you like the potty mouth slapstick comedy type film populated with pretty people then you may (if you're in the right mood) like this naughty little `men are beasts' story.

After discovering her boyfriend (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau - `Game of Thrones') is married, Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz - `Bad Teacher', `Sex Tape', etc)  tries to get her ruined life back on track. But when she accidentally meets the wife (Leslie Mann -`Knocked up', '17 Again', `The 40 Year-Old Virgin', etc) he's been cheating on, she realizes they have much in common, and her sworn enemy becomes her greatest friend. When yet another affair is discovered - Amber (Kate Upton - model), all three women team up to plot mutual revenge on their cheating, lying, three-timing SOB.

Lots of drinking, lots of crusty one liners, and lots of wasted talent here, but it is a chick flick that obviously has a definite audience. Don Johnson, Taylor Kinney represent the men's side, and the supporting cast is huge. Grady Harp, January 15",1421193600,,1209,4.830917874396135

Leslie Mann's voice was grating as pointed out by other reviewers, and all that screaming and hollering got old quickly. The amazing part is that I think Cameron Diaz is far more attractive in every way than Kate Upton! The husband is a loser, but doesn't deserve the unnecessary physical violence.

They don't even go to the bathroom. Here's a movie you can take the wife to and the average husband will look good in comparision.

6392760,1,B00JVSF0T8,"Its always disappointing when Hollywood tries to push female-centric movies by way of following idiotic male-centric formulas. The Other Woman is essentially a Will Farrell/John C. Reilly/Vince Vaughan or Seth Rogen/Jonah Hill/James Franco vehicle, re-fitted for women. From the ridiculous characters; a huge waste of Leslie Mann as an obnoxious, weak, and needy fool, a far-too-old Cameron Diaz as some hot career woman, and a walking Barbie doll in Kate Upton, to the tired plot, and the epic fail to capitalize on what shouldve been a movie that empowers women. Only one of the women (Diaz lawyer) seems to have much sense (Manns talent is downplayed to the point of unimportance until the final wrap-up) and serial cheater Nickolaj Coster-Waldau is so over-the-top that it makes you wonder how all three of these ladies could be scammed by such an obvious player. At every turn, Coster-Waldau is shown as this unbelievably suave lady-killer, making women swoon with a smile and a few words of flattery. Clearly, the screenwriter wants to show that women are just as superficial and easily duped as men. Now, theres some gender equality! Making matters worse, Don Johnson plays Diaz father as a lecherous old man, bedding every young gal he can, and, apparently her daughter is cool with it. If I didn't know that this movie was written by a woman, Id swear it was written by a 20 year old college frat boy.

The plot is stunningly predictable, a few moments of syrupy soundtrack driven reflection are added in to try and fake some gravitas, and there are plenty of scenes of the crazy duo (later trio) getting drunk and being silly gals together. Surprisingly, Diaz character has some smart lines that are mere fronts for the inner girly-girl in all women (I suppose). At one point, she advises the jilted Mann to take one of two roads; the French way of accepted marital infidelity, or the whiny method of trying to work it out. Its smart advice that is completely glossed over because, hey, immediate and explosive revenge is always sweeter than the long drawn out kind, right? The other moment is when she warns Mann that she won't be her friend and sit around braiding hair, getting drunk, and having a sleepover.which is exactly what happens. Oh, you crazy women. Youre all just little girls inside, huh? Sigh. Im glad my 18 year old daughter found this movie as insipid as I did.

This movie couldve been so much smarter than it was, but it chose clichs and formulaic nonsense over intelligence and originality. I suppose it won't be long before we see the female version of The Interview.",1420934400,16,2599,4.8120805369127515
6392761,1,B00JVSF0T8,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Trying to ascertain the demographic target for this POS: senior senile male? Cameron remains beautiful but just too long in the tooth for the hot, seXy role. Moron Mann is overshadowed by the antics of Big Dog, and Upton looks like a chipmunk with boobs.

So, who would enjoy this slapstick stupidity? Not young women, unless they think Manaj with that freak body is inspiring. Young men would view more senior snatch than desired and older men want to see only rake thin nubile hotties. So how'd they do the bait and switch here and for whom?

Only ONE scene in the film intrigued me, and that was the Bahama coastline, just soft, languid and lovely. But what do they do to enhance the beauty? Crank up the extreme cackle of a henpecked trio with no discernible dialogue. Sigh...a friend of mine highly recommended this film, have to rethink that alignment, dementia has surely set in deep.

First Wives Club actually achieved the female empowerment MO while this film degrades women to cartoon characters. Maybe Diaz forgot this was a real film in 3D? She sure was sublime in Shrek! I think the final cut involved many decisions about appearing too revengeful and to prevent some ideas flowing for scorned viewers. Hence, please tell me they had to, under fire, cut the true comical scenes, otherwise no way could anyone green light this absolute absurd mess. High Recommend for the room tempers.

Of course, there's nothing really exciting or new with this concept, but it's fun to watch. You'll root for the ladies in this flick, even the annoying ones and some of the actresses who can't really act (one in particular). Be prepared for one gory scene, but it's quick and you can shut your eyes to let it pass by.

If you are looking for anything remotely intellectual, skip this movie. If you are looking to pretend you're thirteen again and having a slumber party with your girls, this is perfect.",1419638400,,625,4.580357142857143

Many of the funniest parts were in the previews and trailers, but that's true of nearly every comedy movie. The key is the go into watching this with fair expectations, and you won't be disappointed. If you expect the comedy of the century with non-stop laughs, this will probably be a little disappointing.

All said, it's a fun movie to curl up on the couch with your spouse and a tub of popcorn, and enjoy nearly two hours of pleasantly amusing film. You might want to add it to your list and wait until the price comes down a little more (it was $5 for SD and $6 for HD when I rented it) before you watch it.",1419120000,3,687,4.2846153846153845

The end is OTT but the plotting of revenge will suck you in ... if only revenge could be this simple with so few unexpected, unpleasant ramifications we'd all be doing revenge. It's funny precisely because everything goes the way of the three other beautiful women and the lying, cheating husband gets his come-upance. They get rich, give it all away, get the men of their dreams, dump the poor guy - broken and broke - and it all ends happily ever after. Oh, how it goes ...",1417305600,,559,4.490196078431373

6392983,1,B00JVSF0T8,"Terrible movie. The idea seemed like a good one for a comedy. Not exactly original but a good setup for some comic mayhem nonetheless. But other than a few scenes there really isn't much funny here, and there is quite a bit that is just plain boring or worse, irritating. Case in point, Leslie Mann's performance, which consists almost entirely of whining, crying, screaming and just in general making her character as irritating, unattractive, and unlikable as possible. And this is a big problem for a movie that needs the audience to sympathize with her character and not with the cheating husband. This movie failed to make this happen. Once the ladies got around to seeking their revenge I had a hard time deciding who I disliked most, them or the philandering husband. He had done wrong, but he hadn't grated on my nerves for an hour and half.

A good alternate ending would be a likable character showing up to seek revenge on the whole lot for wasting 2 hours of our lives. Maybe in the sequel?",1417132800,3,1002,4.629213483146067

6393047,4,B00JVSF0T8,"Strong in concept, writing, cinematography, and acting from Lesly Mann & Diaz was excellent! Their choice to cast Kate Upton however threw the whole movie down the trash for me. I so wanted to believe her acting, but it was so bad that she couldn't even pull off the ""ditsy"" role she'd been cast in. An actor has to be smart to play stupid. Her attempt was half hearted, like bad soap opera acting, and completely broke all realism for me. Once again, however, Lesly Mann and Cameron Diaz SHINE in this movie, and the movie is worth watching if only for Lesly Mann's performance alone.",1415836800,,585,4.528301886792453

It's about a woman who husband is cheating on her and she finds out and even becomes friends with the various women. They all get together and try to take him down. It was a very predictable movie with not the best storyline. I expected it to also be more funny. The concept had a lot of promise but it was not executed very well.

I love Cameron Diaz, she's such a good, funny actress, and Leslie Mann was really good too, overall, but the movie needed to be MORE wacky and superficial about this topic, or LESS. It was in this uncomfortable, pop-culture, Hollywood-y middle spot.

It was a real bummer that every time there might be a chance for a scene which would show the 3 women connecting (to hear and see WHY they'd ACTUALLY connect, rather than just saying ""Tsk, omg, I knooow, no I'M sorry, I feel terrible"") there would, instead, be a montage of them giggling, looking cute and getting drunk! :/ Urrrg.

Too wacky to be taken seriously, too much of a serious topic to be a lighthearted Rom Com and unwind while watching!

I wouldn't reccommend it overall unless you're bored and you like the actors, because it's pretty fun to see them have some great moments, even if the context is nausea-inducing and weird at times.",1415145600,,1149,4.645320197044335

6393179,4,B00JVSF0T8,"I not only had no desire to see this movie, I thought I would absolutely hate it, yet ended up laughing my head off and really enjoying it.
Leslie Mann is simply divine. It is unfortunate that most actors need to be in dramatic roles to have their talents recognized and appreciated, while comedy is where the real challenge lies. Having all of the emotion of a dramatic role, while not losing the humor requires exceptional skill. Mann brings all the sincerity and devastation of a woman who has not only had her heart broken, but is seeing her world crumble before her and combines it with a quirkiness and endearing hysterics (who knew hysterics could ever be endearing?) that are truly hilarious. While Cameron Diaz has top billing and does do a great job as the straight woman reluctantly drawn into antics and friendships with her cohorts, Leslie Mann's role carries the film and she makes it more than just another goofy piece of fluff to pass an hour and a half. No reason we can't have some substance with our entertainment!
 And on that subject, I also really appreciated that though there are tertiary romantic interests and some happily ever after feel to it at the end, finding their new Mr. Right(s) is not the storyline or purpose of the movie. It's actually about the women and their relationships to each other, in the vein of the ever increasingly popular bromance movies. Yes, woman can be friends and supportive of each other and no, not all stories about women have to be centered around finding a man, which magically solves all their sorrows and woes. So nice to have a slight departure from that tired old schtick.
While the final confrontation with the cheating, scumbag husband lost me a bit in the end as a tad over the top in an inconsistent way from the rest of the film, I otherwise enjoyed every moment and would absolutely recommend watching.",1413936000,17,1874,4.661631419939577

6393223,3,B00JVSF0T8,"For me this movie took too long to get to the let's get revenge theme it is marketed in trailers and other areas as. Although the stalker type relationship between the wife (Leslie Mann) and mistress although unbeknownst to her (Diaz's character) had it's moments, such as when she turned up at the office for the first time and all the work colleagues were obviously listening in.  Most of it dragged on for way too long, it takes around an hour in until we move on from just get your ducks in a row before telling him you want a divorce, to lets get revenge.

Then when we get there the three (Kate Upton doesn't appear until around the hour mark as well) don't think up much at all, and the small number of get even things they do aren't original, they've been done countless times in other films.  Laxative in a drink, tooth brush in a dog's mouth and to clean the toilet (which I don't remember seeing the husband actually use, although actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau does a good job milking every bit of humour from his laxative induced problems so I would have liked to have seen him with the toothbrush and strange taste on the brush, alas we missed out. Hair remover in shampoo, which worked then the writers seemed to have forgotten about it as he has a full head of hair for the rest of the film.

Anyway there was nothing original here. I was expecting to see a movie with three women using their intelligence, looks and othe qualities to outwit a guy who has used them and wronged them and making him ultimately regret his actions or at least know they bettered him.  That's what the previews promised.  Worth watching if on TV one day but I don't recommend parting with money to do so, it's just not original or that good.",1413590400,,1733,4.41692789968652

6393234,2,B00JVSF0T8,"Even as a divorced dude, I don't shy away from what is often described as chick-flicks.  Even ones that focus on despicable louts.  I was curious to see what this one was all about, with the draw being the always good, Leslie Mann and the often good Cameron Diaz.

Here, Diaz plays ""The Other Woman,"" Carly Whitten, a successful attorney with an unsuccessful love life.  She believes she may have found ""the one"" however, in Mark King (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who ""Game of Thrones"" watchers will recognize as Jaime Lannister).  Mark appears to be a successful entrepreneur of start-up businesses.  Carly had set up a dinner with Mark and her dad (Don Johnson), but at the last minute, a plumbing ""emergency"" forced him to leave.  An unsuspecting Carly later arrives at Mark's house only to be greeted by Kate (Mann), his wife.  Carly makes an ungraceful departure.

The next day Kate shows up at Carly's office.  Surprisingly they become friends and through a series of unlikely events, plan to bring Mark down.  Letting the dog lick his toothbrush just isn't enough.  The duo pick up another partner in twenty-something Amber (Kate Upton) who had also been having a liason with Mark.  Amber's best scenes are jogging on the beach in a yellow bikini.  Even Carly and Kate are ogling.

Unfortunately this movie produces little in the way of humor, resorting to inducing diarrhea jokes and other familiar tripe.  What giggles there are come from Mann's character but her apparent ignorance becomes tedious.  It's ridiculous to think she can go from a clueless homemaker to a genius financier by the end of the film.  This is just an unfunny marital revenge flick, forgettable at best.

Unlike the movie, the Blu ray transfer is first rate.  This is a rare movie that is actually shot on film and it looks great.  Using a 1080p video resolution the disc retains the 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The film is colorful throughout and scenes range from great beach scenes to modernesque office buildings to suburban homes.  Excellent detail permeates the movie.  Contrast is excellent throughout.  The audio come with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it is also very good.  Nothing spectacular mind you but the delivery is uniform.  Surrounds get some action with some crowd scenes as well as in a bar.  Dialog is clear and consistent.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a gag reel, a 5 minute funny called ""Giggle Fit"" where Mann and Diaz try to get through a scene, some deleted/alternate scenes, a gallery and a trailer.",1413417600,,2545,4.851162790697674

6393312,5,B00JVSF0T8,"Wow!  This was easily one of the funniest movies that I have seen in a long time.  It walks the line tastefully between raunchy and vulgar.  No nudity was a plus.  The language was not G rated clean, but was not excessively ridiculous like many films these days.  When Carly (Diaz) realizes that her prince charming was not faithful to her, she also realizes that she is the other woman and the mistress.  Becoming reluctant friends Carly and the wife (Mann) realize that they are not the only ones that were played by this Romeo.  They find that he has a younger third woman in his life (Upton).

Hell hath no fury like ""the lawyer, the wife and the boobs"".  These women give a funny, real and fantastic performance that will keep you laughing.  Now, do not get me wrong.  Just because he is a player (Coster-Waldau) is a great actor that gives a performance that you love to hate!  Add in Don Johnson as Carly's dad and you have a cast that delivers!",1412726400,,952,4.408045977011494

It was even a biy interesting in some aspects, but the ending (SPOILER ALERT) with the screaming loser of a husband was just weird. It left us in ""what the hell"" moment.

I can't remember the last time a movie made me laugh this hard.  The first scene was with the two in the bushes - I don't want to give it away too much but you'll know what I mean when you see it, and the second scene was with two main characters in the restaurant followed by one in the restroom. Where did they find Coster-Waldau (whom I had never heard of, sorry to way)?  He pulled off the broad comedy and made it real.  Leslie Mann is a hoot and she and Cameron Diaz kept up the brisk, funny pace throughout the movie, something that a lot of movies fail to do effectively...so kudos to the director, too.

Besides, there are some twists in the story, and I wouldn't want to give anything away.  What I will say is that my wife and I started watching this and it seemed to be a stereotypical movie about a cheating husband, and we had our doubts that we would stick with it as it seemed like there must only be two or three directions it could take.

But the movie quickly took a turn that felt rather fresh and new - quite a feat in the romantic comedy genre.  There were plenty of laughs and the developing chemistry between the women was fun to watch.  Having said all that, I will admit that after the twists in the story were played out and the movie settled into its ending, we thought the very end was rather predictable and uninteresting, compared to the rest of the movie.  But really, that was just the last two minutes so it's not like it affected how much we enjoyed the movie.  In a genre like rom-com, it is the chemistry of the stars and high quality writing that leads to quality, and this movie has both.",1410220800,,1112,4.168224299065421

I am a serious lover of chick flicks, cheesy, dumb movies, but this was actually painful to watch. First, Leslie Mann's character is so annoying. There is a scene where she is ""overwhelmed"" and crying and I just had to mute my TV. Cameron Diaz, as always, plays the ""woman who has everything and seems to have it all together but is emotionally unavailable because of a past relationship trauma"" but falls way short in this film. And Kate Upton CAN NOT ACT. She was horrific. Girlfriend, stick to floating in space in your bikini.

6393800,5,B00JVSF0T8,I have always been a huge fan of Leslie Mann and am happy that she is getting the opportunity to star in lead roles now instead of just as a supporting actress. I was also surprised by how much I enjoyed Cameron Diaz in this role as well. It has been quite some time since I laughed so hard at a Cameron Diaz film (a LONG time). Kate Upton playing the dumb yet beautiful woman reminded me a lot of Marilyn Monroe or Anna Nicole Smith. But Leslie and Cameron's on-screen chemistry and stellar comic timing made this movie a classic.,1409961600,,531,4.267326732673268

When Carley decides to surprise him and meets the wife (Kate) instead, both are somewhat surprised. Neither Carley nor Kate saw this one coming.  What I tell you below is already in the movie promo...

Pretty, but homebody, Kate, with no one to talk to, attaches herself to Carley and the two develop an unlikely friendship.  But then, WAIT-----they find yet another lady, Amber, aka ""Boobs,"" is in the picture.  Join in on the fun when Carley, Kate, and Amber join forces to get even with Player Mark, who thinks he is so hot, that he can just keep playing the field and not get caught.  Also meet Carley's dad, Frank (Don Johnson of Miami Vice), Kate's brother Phil (a real nice guy) and Kate's dog Thunder.  A fun movie...",1409529600,,958,4.594117647058823

This was a pretty good movie and the biggest jewel in this crown belongs to Leslie Mann, who portrays Kate.  She's so dopey, off-centered, and naieve, that she make the most of her character.

6394027,3,B00JVSF0T8,"The Other Woman was good for what it was, a distraction on my tablet while I worked out on a cardio machine. Had a paid to see it in the theater I would have been disappointed.  The trailers promised madcap physical comedy.  It takes a special acting talent to pull off madcap physical comedy.  Lucille Ball and Jerry Lewis being at the tippy top.  Today Jim Carey can do it to hilarious effect and Bullock and McCarthy pulled it off in The Heat.  Leslie Mann, the redhead in The Other Woman, kinda has what it takes to pull off physical comedy in this film but not to the level to carry all the laughs in this film.  And Carmen Diaz and Kate Upton simply do not have it at all.

The movie does offer some laughs, but the big payoffs the audience is suppose to get from the physical comedy scenes just do not pay off.  Carmen Diaz falls out of a second story window and through a gazebo after hiding in the tool of a wedding dress where she nearly suffocated and NONE of the scene is very funny.

A lot of the scenes are slight and you can tell they are slight because pop music is used as emotional filler.  The plot is predictable, which is fine, I mean, it is a revenge film where the wronged women band together to get back at the philandering guy, so the fact that it is predictable is not a big crime. But the predictability actually works against how the characters are played.

Leslie Mann's character of Kate King is so clingy when she meets Carmen Diaz's character and so smitten when she meets Kate Upton's (smitten to the point where she likes the way the Upton character's sweat smells and she smacks the Upton character's behind which is shaking in front of her face as the two of them dance) character that I really thought Kate King was going to be liberated by her husband's cheating because it allowed her to finally realize that she is a lesbian (which would explain why she makes up hygiene excuses to put off having sex with her husband).  Well, obviously the film does not go that way, which left me puzzled as to why this wronged woman was so deeply ""into"" the females with whom her husband cheated.

Don Johnson shows up and is underused as a comedic character.  Nikki Manaj can't act at all but is just funny being herself.

If you want to sit down and really watch a movie.  Do not watch this movie because it will not hold up to the scrutiny.  If you want to use a movie to distract you from exercising or putting on nail polish or folding laundry, then go for it for the light laughs.",1409097600,6,2512,4.2993630573248405

6394080,3,B00JVSF0T8,"Not bad at all, but it loses its steam.  There are some genuinely funny moments.  Most of them coming from Mann and Diaz.  The girls have chemistry on screen, though.

Very different characters linking up, but you don't get as many comedic scenes as serious ones with the girls.  Which is weird for a comedy.  I wished that these girls had been on more adventures and mishaps together--truly a great trio.

Kate Upton can act!  And she is obviously incredible to look at, so win-win.

Waldau is perhaps at his best when he suffers from a few of the ladies' vengeful tactics.  His performance in the bathroom stall deserves an Oscar.  Let's just say it was a VERY tense and suspenseful ""Game of Throne.""  His estrogen-plump nipple scene is great too, but short.

The movie ends its interaction with the husband in a totally inappropriate and horrific encounter that makes no sense.  One of the worst comedic scenes that should have been in a psychological horror movie.  Again, well-acted.  Shocking.  But not funny at all.

Coincidentally that is when Minaj is at her worst with the fakest laugh in the history of cinema.  Otherwise, she was surprisingly good.

The writing is half-done.  Nothing spectacular.  So many comedic scene opportunities missed.  It felt more like a drama that had some funny parts.  It also felt like the writers were not really looking for funny situations, but leaving all the hard work up to the actors.

The cinematography and soundtrack are excellent.  There are some touching moments where the effects of the affairs change the main character and are brought into focus for us by thoughtful camera work and music.

Also, everywhere you go in this film there are good-looking people.  LOL.  For once, I'd love a movie to include a bunch of skinny, obese, odd-featured, and plain people into the mix.  They exist too.  I've seen them.

So, all in all, worth a rent.  If The Other Woman had been thought through more carefully, it could have been a comedy hit.  Like Role Models or Step Brothers.  But the characters do more contemplating and bonding than wriggling out of trouble and awkward situations.",1408924800,,2134,4.801104972375691

6394180,3,B00JVSF0T8,"I downloaded this movie a couple of days ago. I just finishes watching it. Is the movies great? No. Is it terrible? Not really. It's all right. It is refreshing, funny, and predictable. After a long day of work you can definitely do worse.

The movie plot is about a group of women that have been cheated on by a womanizer. They form an unlikely friendship and they plot their revenge together. The plot is very simple minded and you pretty much know what is going to happen from the beginning but the chemistry between Leslie Mann and Cameron Diaz really saves it. I particularly liked the performance by Leslie Mann. She is really funny. I really liked her performance in ""Knocked Up"" and ""This is 40"" and she did not disappoint here.

I was surprised to see that Nicki Minaj made a small appearance in the movie. I like her music but she seemed stiff in this movie. Her character looks forced and out of place. Does Nicki Minaj look like a secretary for a law firm? Kate Upton appeared in more scenes than I expected. She was not bad. She is not Meryl Streep but her role was not exactly demanding.

I liked the movie. Is it worth a purchase? No. I would rent it. Maybe wait for it to come out on cable.",1408492800,,1206,4.327433628318584

You think it is going to be a comedy, but it is more of a ""one woman's fantasy she had after getting cheated on and wrote it down to sell to all other women who have been cheated on"".

She always seems to play the same sort of role and she just isn't a pretty woman.  Huge nose.  Pretty eyes though and apparently she never takes her eye makeup off even to go to bed.  I didn't expect an awful lot from this movie as so many fairly new movies are just not very well done.  But, this was clever and in some places it was laugh out loud funny.

This is a movie I would watch again and if I had the chance to see it at the movies I would not have been disappointed.  I would recommend this if you want a good laugh.

So many funny movies these days (Neighbors, That Awkward Moment, We're The Millers, 21 Jump Street, 22 Jump Street, etc.) have been rated R, and while I thought  they were good movies and really funny, they weren't ones that I would take my kids to see.

The male lead character was new to me and didn't impress me. Probably the main problem is with the script. It is a rehashed storyline and offered nothing to set it apart from others. I don't like gratuitous foul language in a movie and this movie had it. Diaz or the director or someone seemed enamored with using s**t and it wasn't necessary for the story.

6394433,4,B00JVSF0T8,"The Other Woman has a great cast. The roles of the characters are somewhat stereotypical, which at first was off putting but later eased me in to enjoying the diversity of characters. The movie was quite funny and has some good undertone humor that leads to a more important question why we are the way we are and does the why even matter. It's definately worth a rent.",1407715200,,369,4.4411764705882355

But the more appropriate name for movie would be Dumb Women because intelligence wasn't written into any women's role. The writer insults what the viewer is supposed to believe: For example, The role of wife goes from telling her husband she needs ""Brain Camp"" because she doesn't doesn't remember anything even though she supposedly helped him start a successful start-up; no kids but she stays at home and is not involved in their company. The women drink too much, have to ask men for all the ""big"" questions even though Cameron Diaz's character is a lawyer, and generally act like idiots. There are one or two funny lines in the movie but I would wait until it is free on cable if you want to see these usually terrific women in more fitting roles.",1407542400,3,823,4.530201342281879

6394637,5,B00JVSF0T8,"The chemistry between these women is real, so it's totally believable, and you can feel it, IF you're a woman. I think the haters of this movie will all be men. It's about a man cheating and getting his a@@ handed to him by the women he cheated on, sweet justice!, and karma at its best, and I wish this upon every man that does this. BUT, although thats the plot, it turns out to be about these women, and they represent all women, coming together, a sisterhood that grows out of kindness and love, and becomes an unconditional bond, that gives friendship a new meaning, because the bottom line is, 99% of the time, it's not the other woman's fault, its the a%^&ole man that's to blame, and women really need to come together more often in times like this instead of letting men turn them against each other, just saying, no man can turn me against another woman, only she can.

I laughed so much, especially at Leslie Mann's character. She was perfect as the Stepford wife that finally wakes up and realizes she's about to lose more than just her husband.

The husband was a creep as you would guess the three women became best friends Diaz just wanted out by telling the creep to f off but Mann wouldn't let her.

The acting is spotty, the story concept had potential but unfortunately became very predictable and therefore the supposedly surprising moments weren't surprising and not funny. There were a some cute moments, and I could have probably enjoyed it more if they didn't do the overly cutesy lets be best girlfriends forever crap. Why must Hollywood think all women only want to hold hands and sing love songs all day? There also seemed to be a lot of key parts edited out of this movie it went from one thing to suddenly being about another with no real transition or maybe I got distracted for a little while during one of the girly sing along by the bonfire moments. UGH!!!",1407024000,,815,4.551020408163265
6394863,2,B00JVSF0T8,"I watched this moving on a Sunday afternoon and it felt like it was 4 hours long rather than 1 hour 50 minutes -- which is still too long.  It's a rehashed story of ""the other woman"" or in this case it's the ""other women.""  Frankly, I think the tale of the cheating husband with multiple wives and girlfriends is becoming overplayed (as I remind myself not to go down that road in my next book).

Lisa Mann, who plays Kate King, the jilted wife, is about the only smile of humor in the movie.  She is absolutely great as the ditzy other half of a conniving and manipulating husband who takes advantage of her less than stellar brain power. Cameron Diaz plays Carly Whitton, who falls in love with the cheater.  When the wife and Carly meet, Kate wants to be friends. The movie slowly and painfully progresses until girl #3 shows up on the scene, also totally unaware of Mr. King's multiple arrangements with women. Of course, they plot their revenge and on we go -- to where, I'm not quite sure.

There were so many boring and unnecessary scenes, I think the editor must have been asleep on the cutting room floor. It's not one of Cameron's best roles (which I'm frankly stuck on The Holiday as the one I love the most), and I found it disappointing.  The rest of the shallow characters pop in and out - Carly's father leaving his fifth marriage, Kate's brother interested in Carly, all of which do not add very much to the storyline.  Since it's been played so often, I guess there isn't much to add anyway.

If you watch it, keep your fast forward in hand to get through the painful parts. You can rest assured that the cheating husband gets his punishment in the end, and everyone else ends up happily ever after.",1407024000,,1716,4.405063291139241

6394892,5,B00JVSF0T8,"[***Contains what may be considered to be 'mild' SPOILERS]

Ordered this to watch while my hubby was working out of town thinking it would be a good ""chick flick."" Well, it WAS a great chick flick but also enough of at least 3 male characters energies; Mark King as Kate (Leslie Mann) King's handsome but pretty rotten husband played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Game of Thrones), Frank, Carly (Cameron Diaz) Whitten's father, (a bit grizzled looking Don Johnson), and Kate's brother, Phil, played by Taylor Kinney - a not-as-of-yet well known actor but sure with his natural onscreen persona and guy next door good looks, he soon will be a familiar face in movies. The guys' characters are just about as interesting as the girls (JUST about) and the story takes a fairly common premise about infidelity to a higher entertainment level.

All three of the female actors/characters do a fantastic job of making their unique and different personalities very believable and entertaining. This is first I've seen Kate Upton (famous for voluptuous figure as Sports Illustrated model) in a movie and she is really a natural. I also have to give thumbs up for entertainer/actress Nicky Minaj, as Lydia, a spunky and funny assistant to Carly at the high powered NY law firm.

SO, guys there is entertainment here for you too - in fact, my husband and I are watching it again this evening because he actually thought it sounded refreshingly funny which it is.

Kate, (Mann) may give her funniest performance in this role - LOTS of laughs from her zany but endearing character and Diaz does a great job playing the straight contrasting personality to Mann's whacky antics. We get to see them in the Bahamas, and The Hamptons, and of course New York City where Diaz is a high powered attorney and Mann has become a stay-at-home wife living in the Connecticut suburbs yet doing most of the business brainstorming for her cad of a husband.

Perhaps the best scenes are when all three women discover they are romantically involved with the same guy, who is ""dating"" both Diaz and Upton while using Kate to unwittingly put her name as CEO on some of his bogus companies.

When the 3 gals eventually meet up, they form a very unconventional friendship and plan the perfect revenge for Kate's husband while bonding and teaming up together.

This offers some great laughs and is well played out for a lighthearted (and at times romantic) comedy. I laughed a lot more than I thought I would and think it could also be a good 'date movie.' The ensemble work together in perfect cadence and don't skip a beat. We've found that maybe one out of ten movies are really good these days and ""The Other Woman"" won't disappoint (either chicks or dudes ;-))!

P.S. My husband did watch this movie with me the following night and I enjoyed it as much the 2nd time around and was happy to see my husband laughing out loud at a number of scenes. We both agreed this movie had an element of humor not unlike ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Forty Year-old Virgin,"" which at first glance would each seem (respectively) like a chick or a dude flick, but ended up being funny movies for both sexes.",1406937600,7,3144,4.693284936479129

6394898,4,B00JVSF0T8,"Surprisingly funny, good chemistry..Leslie Mann kind of gets on my nerves, but she did have some genuinely funny and also  touching moments, and I think this movie hit on lots of true chords about feelings of loss, of wanting to work it out, of going crazy nuts with the betrayal and anger. Cameron Diaz was the funniest I've seen, actually.
I enjoyed the genuine sisterhood bond going on, the friendships that grew, how women don't have to be enemies, we all go through such similar things and could support each other more.

Since Bridesmaids--one of the most disgusting movies I have ever had to stop watching--I have started to watch for this s*** (so to speak). I wish they would develop a new rating sytem that would warn us. I can handle sex and ""foul"" language, and I really don't need to be warned about them. But fecal scenes--oh, yeah, and vomit scenes--are right up there with violence, as far as I'm concerned.

6394988,5,B00JVSF0T8,"This movie The Other Woman starring Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann and Kate Upton is real funny.  This movie is about a woman named Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz) who has been dating a guy named Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) for like 8 months. On the night that Carly was going to introduce Mark to her father Mark told Carly that he had an emergency at his house. Carly shows up at the house willing to help Mark. Too Carly's surprise Carly meets Mark's wife Kate (Leslie Mann).  Mark did not tell Carly that he was married.  Before Carly showed up at the house Kate did not know Mark was cheating on her. Kate cannot believe Mark could do this to her. Carly and Kate become friends.  Eventually Carly and Kate find out that Mark is dating another girl named Amber (Kate Upton). All three women team up and do pranks on Mark.  While Mark is on a business trip in the Bahamas Kate, Carly and Amber follow Mark and find out that Mark is using Kate name as the owner of the companies Mark defrauded. That leads Kate a possibility to go to prison for her husband mistakes. Watch this movie The Other Woman to find out that happens to Carly, Kate and Amber and even Mark.

6394993,3,B00JVSF0T8,"It was a decent screwball comedy.  Kate is a hard working homemaker who has given up a career to support her husband Mark(Nikolaj Coster-Waldau from Game of Thrones) business career in New York.  Unknown to her, Mark is having an affair with high powered Attorney Carly.  Hilarious hi jinks ensue after Carly tries to suprise Mark at home with a stripper gram and suprises kate instead.

Kate is devastated and Carly is not too happy.  The funniest part of the movie is here as Kate tries to becomes friends with the 'Other Woman' and they finally find revenge as common ground.
Leslie Mann does the 'Lucy' types scenes pretty well.  She brings Kate to Life and makes you laugh with her slapstick hijinks.
Cameron Diaz does a good job as Carly who becomes the heart of the revenge team.  She is very believable as a strong woman in the Corporate world.

Kate Upton.  Looks good in a swimsuit.  Maybe she'll develope like Jessica Lange after King Kong.

Coster-Waldau needs a role where we aren't meant to hate his character.  Mark is 10 times as vile as Jamie Lannister before he met Brienne.  He really makes us loathe Mark not just for what he does to Kate but his generally selfish and predatory towards women.

Nikki Minoj and Don Johnson shine in minor roles.

Overall a good cast and a good story.  I enjoyed how Kate and 'the other women' get their revenge on mark.",1406592000,,1372,4.561475409836065

ALL reviews are opinions and shouldn't be taken out of context. I FINALLY had the time to see this movie and was really surprised how much I liked it. What is so nice to see in this movie, that you don't see a lot of anymore, is REAL chemistry between a group of actors or actresses. They really struck gold on this one! I loved watching these 3 talented beautiful women play these characters. You really get a sense right away that they all mutually love and respect each other on and off camera. I thought the movie was very funny, but had a element of true bonding between 3 ladies brought together in a totally unconventional way. I loved catching the little thing's that go under the radar of a normal audience. The scene where all 3 where following the main male character with Binoculars and Kate Upton stands up totally distracted and starts with ""I see a dolphin"", ""I see a mermaid"" was totally unexpected. I was almost peeing myself. The people who gave it one star have the right to do so, but it's a shame because I feel in some way, they just didn't ""get it"". I would LOVE to see someone bring all three ladies together again for another comedy of some kind. I'd be in line with my jumbo popcorn in a hot minute.

6395083,1,B00JVSF0T8,"First, are you a man? Okay, probably 90% of you are interested in watching this mess only because of the Kate Upton bikini scene, right? If this describes you, stick to the trailer. That is her only sexy scene in the entire film, and you can watch it for free. For the rest of the film, she wears baggy boho clothes and basically plays the dumb blonde, which would not be horrible except for the fact that she is perhaps the worst actress in the history of cinema. Granted, the dialogue and plot are so horrible that Dame Judi Dench couldn't make it amusing or even plausible, but seriously, lovely Kate has no talent beyond looking like a living Barbie. Let me put it to you this way: this film and Kate's performance (and man, I use the word loosely) make Megan Fox's portrayal in ""Transformers"" look like Oscar-worthy material. Still interested? Okay . . .
The basic premise (which is essentially in the title of the film) is that Jaime Lannister (yes, I will call him that throughout the review only because he is mind-blowing in ""Game of Thrones"" and far too fabulous of an actor to have been cast in this piece of garbage) is a gorgeous womanizer who cheats not only on his pretty wife (Leslie Mann, playing exactly the same role as she had in ""Knocked Up"" and ""This is 40"": the lovely, slightly past her prime neurotic wife), but also on his high power attorney girlfriend played by the skeleton who is Cameron Diaz. Don't ask how a man who is married can basically live with another woman without his wife finding out or why (even though they have no kids to take up her time) the wife never asks to go on ""business trips"" with him or has a job of her own. That's asking for a bit of logic, and this film demands that you leave rational thinking at the door.
Okay, fast-forward a bit . . . Cameron and Leslie become BFFs bonding over how sorry Jaime is and decide to take revenge. However, they soon discover that he has a ""Lemon Tart"" in the supernatural form that is Kate Upton. It takes all of five seconds for them to convince her that she should join them on the quest to destroy the Kingslayer and they have awesome slumber parties and girl power sessions. Seriously, I'm not joking. I've seen women fight over men in real life; it never goes like this. Usually, women are ready, willing, and able to rip each other's eyes out for just telephoning their men, let alone sleeping with them, but I digress. The three musketeers team up, battle Jaime, and have REALLY unrealistic outcomes (seriously, one cannot become CEO just because she has a few decent promotional ideas. It actually takes experience and usually a MBA, but you wouldn't know it from this film. This makes ""Legally Blonde"" look like a law school documentary).
This film has everything which makes a Michael Bay film bad (cheesy dialogue, waste of decent actors, and casting of hot chicks without serving any real purpose) without anything which makes a Bay film bearable (no action, no attempt at plot). How bad is it? There aren't just one but two LENGTHY fecal scenes (yay!) Kate has a ""You Go, Girl!"" scene about faking chlamydia (you know, because hooking up with Jaime Lannister is every woman's worst nightmare). About half way through, there seems to have been a change of writers because Jaime's character is completely different. In the beginning, he is the knight in shining armour, unbelievably charming, the type of man who probably could seduce just about any woman. After the halfway mark, he is oily and without any grace or allure. At one point, during a dinner in which he is trying to make up for ditching Cameron and her father, he leaves the table to answer his phone. With Cameron in full view, he hits on another woman, shrugging his shoulders when he sees her look over in disgust. I honestly don't know of any man stupid enough to do this. Even the most slimy guys know not to irk women like that, and I doubt any woman is going to be foolish enough to hit on a man in front of his girl (I've seen major fights break out from far less). The writers of this film must have observed women the way that amateur anthropologists observe foreign tribes: in a way that feels condescending even though they claim to have empowered the tribe with their depictions.
In short, Kate stick to looking hot and keep your mouth closed. Jaime, stick to fantasy material (preferably written by the Master George RR). Cameron, well, all of your films are pretty bad, so this is simply the latest in a long line. And Leslie, dearest Leslie, you are so good when your husband writes your material. Don't try to branch that same character out into other writers' films; you just come across as nit-picky and pathetic.",1405641600,12,4699,4.548996458087367

6395100,3,B00JVSF0T8,"""The Other Woman"" (TOW) has its moments of inspired slapstickery and contains one of the most over-the-top, yet engaging performances by a grown woman in a comedy (Leslie Mann) I've yet seen.  Her controlled physical and emotional histrionics are hardly balanced by moments of resolve and clarity, yet we feel for her and her inability to come to a decision regarding her philandering husband.

While not an incredibly well-written, plotted, or directed movie, TOW is nonetheless eminently watchable regardless of which sex you represent.  I didn't feel particularly put upon or slandered as a male primarily due to the fact that the triple-timing husband seemed to relish in his moral paucity.  The guy is pretty much a total creep.

However, TOW is weighed down by the hugely exaggerated stereotypes of just about everyone save Ms. Mann's character.  (SPOILER ALERT) And the final climax wherein the cheating husband is confronted is silly, overblown, and straight out of the Three Stooges.  Subtlety is not this picture's forte'.

And as for Ms. Upton.  As an actress she's a very good bathing suit model.",1399852800,6,1108,5.111111111111111
6395101,5,B00JVSF0T8,"My mom said she would like to see this.  Once again, we saw a movie that neither of us knew anything about.

I know who Diaz and Mann are, two great actresses.  Kate Upton was one whom Ive never seen.  She did a good job for her part.

The movie is really about three women, who learn to be strong and stand up for them selves for the fact that they are all important and deserve to be treated like people instead of objects.

There may be spoilers below.

Manns character is married.  At first, her husband seems like a nice guy.  But, he is cheating on her.  Over the first part of the movie, you really get to see how bad of a guy he is.  He does not think he is doing anything wrong.  His marriage does not mean a thing to him.  He is also seeing Diazs character.  He treats her like she is the only woman in his life.  One day, Manns Character sees Diazs characters number and calls her.  They realize what is happening.  First, they do not really seem to get along.  Diazs character is a bit heartless.  She is a busy lady who has little time for friends, while Manns character is the exact opposite.  She has that grandmother thing.  Super nice, loving and wants to have fun and be kiddy.  They do a good job of expressing the characters personalities.  Thing happen and they start talking.  Slowly, they realize that they only really have each other.  That is until they both realize that the man is cheating again.  This time of both of them!  Then they meet the third lady.  They start hanging out.  Manns character learns that though she is a nice person, there is a time when you have to forget about being kind and take up for yourself.  Diazs character learns to open up a little and be friendly and trustworthy.  The third girl, well, hey, she is beautiful.  Haha Youll see.  The movie is all about them finding strength in and from one another.  Though I am a 29 year old guy, I like this movie.  It just leaves you with a happy feeling.  I laughed so hard at many parts of this movie.  I will pre order the blu-ray as soon as it is available.  I look forward to seeing outtakes.  So, check it out.",1399507200,74,2114,4.21608040201005

The movie is a chick flick. Cameron Diaz is not the spry Charlies' Angel anymore. Leslie Mann plays an unrealistic character that was fun to watch. And Kate Upton ran in slow motion in a white bikini. This was a fun formulaic film that is not deep. Good sound track helped in the enjoyment.

The story is straightforward: the guy is a serial cheater, and his wife and two of his girlfriends befriend each other and plot their revenge.

From that premise, the makers of this movie extract the humor: mostly at the expense of the cheating guy, but also from the three women.

This is a formulaic light entertainment, and as such, it's a well made example.

Cameron Diaz shows her deft comic touch again, while Leslie Mann is engaging as the frustrated wife.

6395106,5,B00JVSF0T8,"At first blush this movie appears to be a jilted wife/ mistress triangle movie which has been explored many times in the movies, and on the Lifetime Channel, or as I like to call it, the 'I hate Men' channel, so I was not overly enthused with the premise, and plunked down some money while scanning to see what movies might be starting slightly later, just in case.

Directed by Nick Cassavetes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Notebook-2004/dp/B000YMM3CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Notebook (2004)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alpha-Dog/dp/B000Q4RJM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alpha Dog</a>&nbsp;(which he also wrote),  son of actor and director John Cassavetes this movie has quite a pedigree.  Screenwriter Melissa Stack has crafted a brilliant comedy.

Leslie Mann has gotten better every time I have seen her.  When she starred in the Change Up with Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman,  I thought she was the saving grace in a somewhat obnoxious comedy, and I thought her performance was brave, daring and endearing, and pushed boundaries.

Here her performance is off the charts brilliant, and I do not think it unreasonable to say no actress on the planet could have played the part better, and she is the single most compelling reason to see this movie.

She manages to be all things, funny, emotional, endearing, charming, sympathetic, easily matching the more experienced A list actress Cameron Diaz, comedically brilliant, and possessed of a marvellous feminity.

The Other Woman is a much better than expected comedy which worked on every level for me.  Cameron Diaz plays an unmarried lawyer who has fished extensively in the dating pool, and been disappointed with her catches.  Her secretary played by Nicki Minaj offers very dubious dating advice.  Her new love turns out to be an already taken man, Leslie Mann his wife.

Wife and alleged mistress after initial awkwardness form an unlikely alliance to seek a witty revenge on a cheating husband.  The movie produces a serious of scenes, some based on witty humor, much based on physical comedy.  I found myself so wrapped up in the moment that I rarely thought ahead, and loved every moment, as did the audience around me many of whom were women.  Kate Upton plays another...let's just say that this husband gets around, and this small but determined group seeks a means of justice.

I enjoyed Kate Upton. I don't know if acting is something she wishes to pursue as a career, but one had the sense of her authentic nature coming through, and she seems to be a sweet girl, who fit in easily and comfortably with her more accomplished acting colleagues.

There were a number of scenes where I had to cover my eyes, and the absurdity of the nature of revenge was absolutely delightful.

Though female energy drives the movie most men who see it will also enjoy and not simply dismiss as a 'chick flick.'
The Other woman gave me a much better than expected experience.

If you like this movie you will also probably like The First Wives Club with Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn.

I think most people will enjoy this movie and I hope this was helpful.",1398470400,150,3215,5.203883495145631
