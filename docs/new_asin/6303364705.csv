I bought one for my mother once and my brother ""borrowed"" it and has yet to return it to her eight or so years later! One of my dear friends loves it so much that he always ask me when I am going to return HIS movie! The nerve! Anyway, you will LOVE this comedy. Great addition to your classics collection or to your holiday inspired movies. Hurry up with more DVDs of this movie! I want to replace the VHS!",1131062400,4,581,3.9322033898305087
644602,5,6303364705,"This is another great movie by both Loretta Young and Celeste Holm. I have noticed a number of other Loretta Young movies, some I've not even heard of, available on DVD. THIS one SHOULD be out on DVD and it's not. Based on the reviews here, there is obvious love for this movie, and there should be. It's funny, great and heartwarming. I'll bet if Amazon started collecting email addresses from those of us interested in getting a DVD copy and let the owners of the movie know how much interest there is, they would eventually do it !  Please, all those who want a DVD copy to preserve this movie in your home libraries, let Amazon know!!!",1104796800,64,639,4.415254237288136
644603,5,6303364705,"In the late 1940's and into the 50's, there was a decency and innocence which existed that has all but disappeared today.  This movie is a simple, wonderful story about innocence and blind faith, played beautifully by Loretta Young and Celeste Holm in the form of 2 French nuns.  Using their charisma, they manage to get a children's hospital built in an affluent area, in which the people eventually are won over by these charming nuns. It is a ""feel good"" movie of the first magnitude, and, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful films ever made.",1073520000,101,550,4.6020408163265305
644604,4,6303364705,"Normally, a movie about a writer of popular songs discovering that what he thought was his original song actually was inspired, wouldn't really appeal to me. The character played by Loretta Young almost does the trick, though - and the scene in which Young's character asks Luigi Rossi for help always tears me up. This is a good Second List movie.",1060732800,8,348,4.721311475409836
644605,5,6303364705,"This movie and The Bishop's Wife are my 2 favorite Loretta Young
films.  I, too, saw it on TV years ago and finally found a video to buy.  I watch it at Christmas time, also.  The two nuns, Loretta and Celeste Holm, arrive in Bethlehem, CT. during a snowstorm.  Something I noted when I saw film:  my father's relatives used to live in Waterbury, CT. back in the '50s and '60s. When we visited them, up the big hill from where they lived, there was sign advertising the town of Bethlehem, a re-creation of the biblical town of Bethlehem--a local tourist attraction that presented pageants this time of year.  I think of that when I watch this film.  Wonder if the makers of the film knew that, because the sign in the road the nuns see says ""Bethlehem, CT.""  Is Bethlehem, the CT. tourist attraction from my youth, still going strong? Is it located in or nearby Waterbury, CT.  I never went to see it, so I don't know for sure.",1039651200,9,927,4.374269005847953

644607,4,6303364705,"I have been searching for 2-3 years to find this movie, having seen it on television and never knowing its actual title. Once informed, I had to write about it to tell you how wonderful this movie is.
This movie is about two nuns who come from France to keep a vow made during wartime. Their hospital was not bombed during the war, so they had promised God they would come to America and found a hospital to St. Jude. (The patron saint of hopeless causes). They are drawn to a particular town, Bethelehem, because of an artist who works and paints at a stable there.
They come with almost no money, certain that they can raise the funds. They have a chosen a site for the hospital, but it is owned by a known racketeer. They know nobody in the area, but manage to work their way into the hearts of most of their neighbors. They persevere til the very last day... will they ever build their hospital? With faith in their hearts, they know they will.",996364800,36,948,4.331460674157303

644728,4,6303364705,"Like The Sound of Music another film with religious themes that also was dismissed by some as saccharine and overly sentimental Come to the Stable is based on actual events.  In 1947, two Roman Catholic nuns of the Benedictine religious order based in France, one an American woman named Mother Benedict arrived in the United States.  Mother Benedict as an enemy alien had been in hiding from the Nazis through World War II, and had narrowly escaped capture.  In gratitude to God, she resolved to return to her native country to found a Benedictine monastery or abbey to introduce monastic life in America.  She was successful in her mission and the Abbey of Regina Laudis was established in Bethlehem Connecticut that continues to flourish to this day.

Noted writer and recent convert to Catholicism Clare Boothe Luce fashioned a story loosely based on these events  that became the basis for Come to the Stable.  To make it more accessible to audiences, rather than establishing an abbey for prayer and contemplation, the two nuns would found a childrens hospital.  Here is a brief synopsis;  Sisters Margaret (Loretta Young) and Scholastica (Celeste Holm) travel from France to the little town of Bethlehem CT. with the vision to build a childrens hospital.  They move in with kindly religious artist Amelia Potts (Elsa Lanchester), whose painting Come to the Stable"" inspired them as to where in the United States they should settle.  The bishop of Bethlehem although sympathetic is unable to grant them financial support, but gives them permission to try.  The nuns determine the perfect location, a piece of property owned by a gangster Luigi Rossi (Thomas Gomez).  They enlist the help of songwriter Bob Mason (Hugh Marlowe) who owns the adjoining estate & rents Miss Potts her home.  Even though hes a good person and admires the sisters, Bob  is adamant about not having a hospital next to his home. How the nuns deal with these obstacles is the crux of the film.

Be warned, yes this film is sentimental and a trifle glossy, but as I mentioned is rooted in truth.  For example the real nuns did in fact enjoy the hospitality of a well-known local artist in Bethlehem Connecticut, Lauren Ford who specialized in paintings of Biblical subjects.  It has a definite charm and was a hit with the public and rewarded with seven Oscar nominations, but no wins.

One of Hollywoods most noteworthy Roman Catholics actress Loretta Young was tapped to play the pivotal role of Sister Margaret.  Apple cheeked and luminous, Ms. Young brings an unruffled serenity linked to a quiet determination and resolve that is considerably effective.  Ms. Holm has an engaging twinkle as her associate Sister Scholastica, and handles her French accent quite nicely.  As the soft hearted artist Amelia Potts who allows her tranquil world to be turned topsy turvy by the Sisters, Elsa Lanchester is endearingly bewildered.  All three of these ladies were tapped with Oscar nominations, Ms. Young for Best Actress, the Misses Holm and Lanchester with Supporting Actress nominations.

In the other leading role, Hugh Marlowe as Bob Mason nicely balances his fondness for the nuns coupled with his frustration when they threaten his idyllic country existence.  As the mob boss Luigi Rossi, Thomas Gomez has several touching moments.  Finally Dooley Wilson, as Bob Masons major domo has an engaging sweetness without being overly sticky.

As a product of a Roman Catholic grammar school  where I was taught primarily by nuns who were by and large bright, kind women with a couple of exceptions, I have a soft spot for films about nuns.  It used to shown at Christmastime, which is how I happened upon it.  Although it is not set during the Christmas season, with its message of unselfish giving, it is certainly appropriate.",1481500800,,3805,4.965244865718799

Anytime you need to remember that amazing things can happen when people just decide to believe. These nuns are fun, funny and so determined they start with almost nothing and yet let nothing stand in the way of their goal. They've decided they are going to build a hospital on a beautiful area of New England and by God they will, even though their own church isn't sure its possible. Great performances by Loretta Young, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe is a pleasant surprise, as is Dooley Wilson, Elsa Lancaster and Thomas Gomez. Really superb film no matter who you are, its not preachy, its just good. And funny, and sweet. Its about when you decide to do something, and its the right thing to do, and as you move toward that goal, its actually more likely that you'll succeed, because that's how powerful we are spiritually. People jus fall in line, one by one, they are no match for these ladies' determination, good fun!",1466985600,3,1028,4.562162162162162

There are no plot twists nor evil characters, just people trying to do the right thing, and everything works out because of that. If you want to watch a movie that respectfully treats faith, devotion, and religion, albeit in simple terms, this is worth a watch.

These two truly professional actresses brought believeability to the story, infused humor so effortlessly that you thought the humor to be strictly spontaneous and not part of the script and added a beauty to the  story that made you truly realize that anything is possible if you only have faith and believe in that faith.  Too bad we don't have any so-called actresses in Hollywood these days that can truly act let alone give a performance of the caliber that both Ms. Holm and Ms. Young were noted for during their entire respective careers.  .",1416182400,,689,4.716666666666667
645049,5,6303364705,"This has become a Christmas staple at my house through the years however, it is not just a story for Christmas but for all the days of every year.  Two Nuns, Loretta Young as Sister Margaret and Celeste Holm as Sister Scholastica, come to the USA from a convent in France with the hope of building a Children's Hospital in America.  They have arrived at a very small town in New England, named Bethlehem, to begin a journey Sister Margaret promised her efforts to during WW II when she approached an American General and asked him to spare the hospital she was in charge of in Normandy, even though it was being used as an observation post by the Germans. It was spared and the children were saved, but with loss to American lives.  It was then Sister promised to build that hospital in America!  Almost upon their arrival in Bethlehem, they find a perfect piece of property on which to begin building.  Of course, they have very little funding and very slight possibilities of securing more so they arrange a visit with the local Bishop to enlist his aid. He informs them that no such aid is possible and presents them with the parameters from which they must undertake this mission. The stipulations are that they must build it with very little, if no financial help from the Catholic church at large and must enlist both the help and monetary donations from private citizens in order to fulfill their vision.  Added to that is the time limit given them by the Bishop, of just a few months, and you have what might be deemed as an impossible mission for which a series of miracles will be needed!  The wonderful cast members also include Elsa Lanchester as Miss Potts, a struggling artist who lives just across the way from the property on which  they wish to build, Hugh Marlowe as Bob Masen, a successful songwriter who also lives across from the property and rents his barn to Miss Potts as her home/artist studio, Dooley Wilson as Anthony James a rather religious all around handy-man who works for Bob Masen, Thomas Gomez as Luigi Rossi, a racketeer who lives in New York City and who owns the property on which they wish to build and Regis Toomey as Monsignor Talbot, the local church official and assistant to the Bishop! We all know that miracles do occur in life and it is a pleasure to watch the ingenious ways in which the Sisters and their newly found ""friends"" actually interact in order to defeat...yes, I said defeat its construction...or try to bring this hospital to fruition through the incredible odds ahead.  It is a wonderful roller coaster ride of peaks and valleys we all hope will culminate in success for the Nuns and the people around them. Nominated for 7 Academy Awards, everyone went home empty handed that night, but the film is a gem and you will hopefully end up with your hands full of this marvelous film to enjoy many times over!",1416182400,,2866,4.58203125

This review is for: Come To The Stable (DVD)

Title: Hard working clergy show how to get the job done
This is a very well done movie about the 40s era. And at a time when funds were always scarce,
in the context of the War and lingering challenges from the great depression.

So then two determined French nuns want to come to the US and build a children's hospital.
The nuns come to life through excellent acting by Loretta Young and Celeste Holm.

The local bishop in a rural area thinks such a project is not possible. But the nuns, with smiles and
all due respect, persuade him to give them limited time to get land, financing , etc.

I guess the nun's burning desire, done with determination and smiles, got me to think about
how we tend to give up in difficult times, or worse yet, get angry and burn bridges.

But there are other ways to deal with such obstacles. This movie can show the way. I do not want to
give away the ending, but the example of the two nuns can bring joy to us, and maybe success now and then.

645118,3,6303364705,It apparently is an old VHS tape and the audio is not good.  But the movie itself is  very excellent.,1403049600,,101,4.0
645119,4,6303364705,I am now a recovering Catholic but for some reason I still like this film a lot.  I first saw in my innocent (and still remote) youth and still enjoy Loretta and Celeste.  Some of it a bit cutesy poo for 2014 but I am glad Fox Cinema Archives put it out.,1402876800,,254,3.8653846153846154
645154,5,6303364705,Old christmas movies are great.  There is no swearing or violence.  You can invite the whole family and not worrying about anyone being offended.,1401840000,2,145,5.0
645155,5,6303364705,It is the innocence of this type of movie that is so charming.  The movies of this era were quite predictable but always showed people the right thing to do -- better known as values!  Loretta Young was very good in her role.,1397952000,2,225,4.209302325581396
645156,5,6303364705,"This was a great light hearted movie.  I love the old movies and they bring back some great memories.

645160,5,6303364705,"If you enjoy movies about what faith can do, you will love this one.  Loretta Young and Celeste Holmes are excellent as the two nuns
who never give up in their desire to build a church. I highly recommend this one.",1392076800,,214,4.219512195121951
645161,5,6303364705,My husband and I and our two teenage boys enjoyed this uplifting film.  I just don't get the same feeling from modern movies as I do from some of these old classics.  People weren't afraid to admit that religious faith was a necessary and good thing in society when this movie was made.,1390867200,,286,4.377358490566038
645162,5,6303364705,It's a gift - an oldie but goodie.  The older movies give the audience something deeper and sensitive to ponder.,1390780800,,112,4.6
645163,5,6303364705,Delightful.  Love the story and the stars.  Celeste Holm is beautiful and rivals Miss Young.  What a team. And William Holden isn't bad either,1390521600,,142,4.833333333333333
645204,4,6303364705,"This film was made shortly after World War II: a time when movie goers could take their children to the movies without fear, where they could buy their ten cent popcorn and their five cent cokes, learn a simple moral lesson, and leave the theater feeling better than when they went in.  It was a time when America was perceived as the greatest Christian nation on Earth and Americans as being a highly moral people.  That perception, in my view, was due in large measure to foreigners viewing films such as this.  Unfortunately, those days are gone forever.

Its not an artful film: the plot isn't particularly believable; the characters are right out of Guys and Dolls and The Bells of St. Marys; and the acting isn't of the finest.  But it tells a heartwarming story: the story of two nuns who arrive in the United States shortly after World War IIs end, virtually penniless, but intent on building a hospital in America.  Its a story that, if you're not careful, will draw you in, bring a bit of joy to your heart and maybe even a tear to your eye.  So, I suggest you pop some corn in the microwave, get some cokes from the fridge, plop your kids on the couch, stick your feet up, and enjoy this uplifting film.  (So, you miss a few blown-up cars, gruesome murders, and gratuitous sex --- What the heck?  There are plenty of those around.)",1390176000,8,1342,4.467213114754099

645211,5,6303364705,This is a great family movie with values you will enjoy. The two nuns in the story are a riot in how they solve the problem of building a hospital for children.

build a hospital.  They arrive with no money, no where to stay, only with faith that they could accomplish this

I won't give the story line in detail as that's available elsewhere, but suffice to say it's a wonderful story of grace, faith and entrepreneurial spirit set at Christmas time just after World War II. I think Catholics will appreciate it even more as it treats the subject of faith without tiptoeing around it or short-handing it.  Those unfamiliar with nuns and the Catholic church will still enjoy it so long as they enjoy the slower paced gentle story telling of this era. There's humor in there, too, and wonderful performances from most of the cast.

This time around, I couldn't be more pleased.  This black and white film looks great!  And who portrayed a nun better than Loretta Young (and Rosalind Russell).  She's absolute perfection and beauty.  This story of the simple faith of, in particular, two nuns who come to Pennsylvania from Europe to establish a hospital, is heartwarming, occasionally funny, touching, enchanting.  Elsa Lanchester is wonderful in the film too, unwittingly taking the two nuns in and providing them with lodging, soon expanding her hospitality to almost a dozen of them as they work to raise the money that will help them buy the building that will be their starter hospital.

645467,3,6303364705,"Though well-intentioned the overall effect of the movie was flat, lackluster.  The leading male star, Hugh Marlowe, was so poorly directed his performance is too uninteresting to carry so much of the movie.  They needed a Cary Grant or a Clark Gable, but even they would have had trouble carrying such a thin story.  The movie-makers wanted a large issue to hinge the plot on but failed.  A running gag of the movie--virtuous nuns in an unvirtuous world, was far too contrived; and the scenes with these gags were predictable. Also a scene in which the viewer discovers the unsuspected talents and skills of the staid nun was border-line kitsch.  The nun's imposition on the artist-character (Elsa Lanchester) was not well explained and seemed more like bad manners rather than the nun's, as people of faith, inspiring charity in that character's heart.  This movie suffers a great deal by an unavoidable comparison to The Bells of Saint Mary's.

What I liked: Loretta Young and Celeste Holm as on-screen personalities--scintillating; Elsa Lanchester, always delightful and engaging--doubly so here; and  Thomas Gomez's portrayal of the gangster.  I was impressed by the role for the African-american, Arthur (Dooley) Wilson.  It was neither subservient nor demeaning as so many movies of that period were towards people of color.  In fact, he has one of the most important lines in the movie.",1345766400,2,1393,5.092511013215859
645468,5,6303364705,"Was there anyone better than Loretta Young at playing the good girl?

Credibility is cheerfully tossed aside as, one by one, obstacles fall by the wayside.

There is a fine supporting cast here including Elsa Lanchester and Dooley Wilson (""Casablanca"").  Was that Irving Bacon, who played Mr. Carstens, the sore-footed postman in ""Cause for Alarm'?

The Video Hound's ""Golden Movie Reviewer"" speculated that CS was Fox's answer to Paramount's ""Going My Way"" and ""The Bells of Saint Mary's"". If so, CS wins out.

645471,5,6303364705,"Most people know little about Loretta Young's career. Much of what they know is based on their familiarity with her hugely successful TV show of the 1950s when she and Lucille Ball were TV's biggest stars.  But the Loretta Young of the early 30s and precode Hollywood was quite a different actress.  In those days, she played tough working class women opposite tough Hollywood actors like James Cagney (Taxi) and Spencer Tracy (A Man's Castle).  In those early days she had no qualms about playing sexy women who always got their man.  Then as she blossomed into womanhood, Hollywood realized they had on their hands one the most beautiful women on the silver screen, and she was ""promoted"" to roles of socialites and queens (Suez).  In Come to the Stable Young plays for the first time a nun (she played a nun several times on her TV show).  And she is quite good, as good as Ingrid Bergman, famous for playing a nun in The Bells of St. Mary.  What most people don't know is the the screenplay for this film was written by Clare Booth Luce, and it was specifically written for Loretta Young.  Both Luce and Young were well-known Catholics.  And they were both known for promulgating their Catholicism, for which many in Hollywood resented them; Young more resented when the world learned she and Clark Gable were lovers and Young had a child by him, a daughter she adopted through a ruse that tricked most of Hollywood and surely most of her legions of fans.  Nevertheless, Come to the Stable is a charming film with terrific performances by Young and Celeste Holm.  It has the charm and timelessness of A Wonderful Life and The Bishop's Wife.  Parents, you can without worry allow your children to watch this film.  They may indeed be uplifted and inspired by it, for it's a story of two selfless people who have devoted their lives to helping the sick, their main goal to establish a hospital in America.  With all the junk available to our children, our kids today could perhaps learn something from a film like this.  Both Young and Holm were nominated for Academy Awards, Young for best actress, Holm for best supporting actress.  And they both deserved their nominations.  Hope the film is cast in a better DVD. It deserves to be available to all film buffs.  Last word, watch Young in her early 30s films, you'll be surprised by how good an actress she was when only in her teens.  And as for her beauty:  she's breathtaking, and for a sight of that, watch the opening scenes, if you can find the film, of Suez.

645530,5,6303364705,"This the holiday season, sentimental fare like COME TO THE STABLE rises to the fore like clockwork. Not as well known as Crosby's GOING MY WAY and THE BELLS OF ST. MARY, not as seminal as LILIES IN THE FIELD, COME TO THE STABLE still manages to infiltrate your cynical self and work into your good graces. It doles out an abundance of warmth and gentle humor, and the cast is marvelous. I say park the entire family in front of this charming 1949 comedy.

Sister Margaret (Loretta Young) and the awesomely named Sister Scolastica (a demure Celeste Holm) are two near penniless nuns from a French convent come to Bethlehem, Connecticut to fulfill a sacred vow to found a children's hospital. They've cut down their list of necessities to two essential items: they now only require land and financing. Heh. Their primary assets are their unwavering faith and a relentless way about them that would impress even the Terminator. They seek charity from those around them - never mind that those around them may scoff at their improbable mission - and although the sisters go about their task with cheery serenity, there's a doggedness there. And a certain obliviousness in their approach. They're almost dismissive of the daunting impracticality of their objective. But that's faith for ya.

There's a fascinating element here, in watching these two nuns alternately charm, befuddle, and exasperate those they encounter and, in the end, achieving their lofty goal. It speaks of a Teflon-like mystique which surrounds nuns. They are unassailable figures. There's no use getting mad at them. Even underworld figures don't dare mess with the sisters. Those seemingly insurmountable obstacles that had initially faced Sisters Margaret and Scolastica soon tumble down like sand castles.

Loretta Young and Celeste Holm do their utmost to ingratiate themselves to the audience, submitting delightful, low-keyed performances, with Young getting the lion's share of the dialogue. Although in very good form, Young doesn't quite match her impeccable turn in THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER. Still, Young would be nominated for an Oscar in the leading actress category but would lose out to THE HEIRESS' Olivia de Havilland. Celeste Holm is so very disarming as the shy French nun, and her French accent is ridiculously spot on. The sisters are given traits guaranteed to have you big grinning, from Sister Margaret's reckless driving of the jeep to Sister Scolastica's susprising reveal as an ex-champion tennis player. For me, the meek Sister Scolastica's expert fielding of tennis balls on the court provides the film's most memorable and unexpected imagery.

No sneering villains in this one, no bad guys, really. The nuns brave the den of a notorious racketeer, but even those scenes don't exude a sense of peril, and the mob boss (Thomas Gomez), when confronted with the nuns' disconcerting directness, gives way like silly putty. The plot's central conflict comes from the resentment of a music composer (Hugh Marlowe) who rails against a children's hospital being erected next to his home. Marlowe plays his character as harried and  irascible but we all know he's a good dude at heart. To round off the supporting cast, Elsa Lanchaster - who, along with Celeste Holm, would be nominated for a Supporting Actress Oscar - plays a distracted artist who reluctantly opens up her stable-cum-art studio to shelter the nuns. Dooley Wilson - or ""Sam"" from CASABLANCA - is the composer's quietly undermining butler. Basil Ruysdael is the stern local Bishop who warily keeps an eye on the nuns' progress.

There's a good balance of comedy and drama, the film treating us to a story that is heartfelt without being preachy. It's a bit of a shame that COME TO THE STABLE has become a neglected gem, even though it garnered the sum of seven Academy Award nominations. This movie was well regarded enough that there was a proposed sequel - titled A SPARK IN THE NIGHT - which would've reunited Young and Holm, although nothing ever came of it. Still, if you're looking for a hearwarming, funny, old-fashioned Christmas movie - even though this movie doesn't really take place during Christmas - then see this one and be transported to a good place. And if you come across a nun in real life, don't put up a fight. Just do what they say. Nuns are indefatigable entities, more tireless than killer robots from the future.",1322092800,4,4389,4.9890710382513666

When relaying to me her favorite holiday movies she always mentioned ""Come to the Stable"".  She had an old copy that she taped off commercial TV but she never had a DVD version.  I've been looking for years for her but no dice.  She mentioned it to me again recently and by chance I came across an outfit in San Diego that was selling a multi-region DVD printed in Asia.  I had it mailed to my Mom and asked her if she was satisfied with the quality.  She said she was and thanked me profusely.  My mother having grown up in the Forties has an affinity for films of that era.  I grew up in the Seventies so I have nostalgia for that time.  I borrowed the disc from her to see what the hubub was about.  All I can say is it is what it is-a nice little film.  It's formula but it's a formula that works.  It's no better or worse than some of the heartwarming films that crop up on the Hallmark Channel.  It's not out of place if you were to view it during the holiday season.

645738,5,6303364705,"This movie is about two nuns who come to this country to build a children's hospital. But it is more than about two nuns who want to build a children's hospital. It's about faith, focus, using the Laws of Attraction. They are a wonder to watch as they steadfastly move forward, never losing site of their goal, making modifications and slight concessions to keep on target. For anyone who is interested in The Secret or wonders about the Law of Attraction, this is the movie for you. I've watched thousands of films, and cannot think of one that so obviously shows the result of what can happen when a goal is set, steps are taken, unexpected obstacles manuevered and that goal finally achieved using intense focus and unwaivering belief. So, if you think that this movie is just about two nuns who want to build a children's hospital, think again.",1251676800,,848,4.66

645741,5,6303364705,"I wish to add my opinion about this film--I have watched it and watched for it seasonally since first seeing it on the tiny snowy screen of my parents TV.
It is an enchanting film.  In the best traditions of the Christmas films of the 1940s and 1950s.  It is a tale of blind faith overcoming a powerful villian who is blocking the path of the faithful.  In many ways it does bare a strong resemblance to ""Lilies of the Field"" and ""The Bells of St. Mary""
Knowing that many older films have been lost forever, I hope there is still a good copy available to restore and transfer to DVD soon.  This is a charming story with fine preformances, the family can enjoy year after year.",1196121600,3,676,4.299212598425197

Growing up, each and every holiday season she, and her family, would sit around the television and enjoy this heartwarming film.  If only it were available on DVD!  I'd love to fulfill her wish and present it to her this holiday season.  Too bad another year will pass without being able to purchase it.

If any of you happen to see it listed in your local TV Guide this holiday season, be sure to give it a chance.  I've yet to see it but she tells me it's a great Christmas film.",1195948800,3,532,4.166666666666667
645743,5,6303364705,"This is a fine film, one that I would put on every Christmas if only it was available. The dearth of pure garbage currently on DVD has me totally baffled that someone hasn't found a way to get this to the general public (and make some money!). It's a 20th-Century Fox release, for God's sake.  Anyway, it was nominated for 7 Oscars in 1949, including Clare Booth Luce's witty screenplay, Young as Best Actress, both Elsa Lanchester & Celeste Holm as Supp Actress, Art Direction, Cinematography and Best Song (Through a Long & Sleepless Night). It was directed by Henry Koster (The Bishop's Wife) and is quite simply one of the most entertaining films I've seen. According to previous reviewers, it's also on their lists. Loretta Young's career spanned over 7 decades, yet she only received 2 Oscar nominations (winning for '47's ""The Farmer's Daughter""). Her success on TV only sealed her place as an icon in the performing world. What's so hard to understand about a waiting public, wanting quality? A good DVD of this film could solidify its place among the classic films. I'm still waiting...",1166745600,28,1095,4.824468085106383

645745,4,6303364705,"Come to the Stable is a charming movie that deserves to be on DVD.  There is fine acting all around and Hollywood can relearn on how to depict religion in a positive light and tone from movies from the late 1940's.

One of my favorite movie lines comes from this movie.  Robert Mason and friends (the Yuppies of the 1940's) are having drinks at his ""country house"" in Connecticut and ""Bob"" is fretting about the nuns when one of the guests says something along the lines ""Oh come on Bob, don't let a bunch of nuns get you down""

I consider Come to the Stable to be a Christmas movie and try to watch it during the Holiday Season.",1147132800,5,629,4.260504201680672

  Good old fashioned family entertainment.  Teaches the VALUE of faith and hard work.  God doesn't just give these nuns what they ask for they must work for it and THEN HE gives MORE than they ask.",1138579200,12,448,4.525
645747,5,6303364705,"First, I would like to add my vote regarding releasing this film on DVD. It would be a welcome addition to my library; I borrowed a family member's VHS copy but I won't purchase my own copy unless it's a DVD.

Also, I would not consider this a holiday film. Although the opening scene features a nativity, the film takes place in late winter, early spring, which makes it perfect viewing for the lull after the holidays.

Viewers may wish to know that the film is based on a true story that did take place in the real Bethlehem, Connecticut, located in Litchfield County not far from Waterbury (mentioned in a previous review). I believe Clare Boothe Luce, the famous women who penned the script, lived nearby. The original backstory takes place in the '40s, when two nuns from a French order -- one American and one French, I believe -- came to Bethlehem to found a Benedictine abbey known as the Abbey of Regina Laudis. They were from an abbey in France that was caught up in World War II and eventually freed with the help of Gen. Patton.

When they came to Bethlehem, they were taken in by artist Lauren Ford who, like the artist in the film, also painted religious paintings. A wealthy industrialist donated land on which to build the abbey, which still is a thriving community today. The nuns are very self-sufficient, each with a special skill whether its agriculture, pottery, cheese, etc. They have a small store on their property where they sell their creations. The nuns also chant several times a day in their barn-like church, and even have recordings of their chant which one can purchase online or at their shop. They have an outdoor theater where they host plays in the summer for the community.

On a side note: the Abbey also has another real-life Hollywood connection. One nun is the former Dolores Hart, a film star in the '60s who starred in films like ""King Creole"" opposite Elvis and ""Where the Boys Are.""

I think fans of the film will find the story behind the film equally as interesting, making this wonderful film even more relevant.",1137974400,23,2061,4.620218579234972
