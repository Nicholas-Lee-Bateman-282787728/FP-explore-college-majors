8393732,4,B003BL2LBG,"It merely takes a quick glance at the match listings on 'Fighting Spirit' to know this isn't one of Ring of Honor's strongest showcases. There's still plenty of the company's trademark athleticism, however, despite the absence of many ROH regulars that would've boosted this DVDs stock. Until the main event, this release rates a **, maybe ** and a half.
  But oh, that main event. I purchased 'Fighting Spirit' without even looking at any of the undercard attractions; the two guys adorning the front of the case told me all I had to know. Without a doubt, most big ROH fans would include Nigel McGuiness in their top 5 greatest company wrestlers since ROH's inception til now. Other no-brainers would include Bryan (Daniel Bryan) Danielson, Austin Aries, Samoa Joe, and CM Punk, possibly. For me, it's a 3 way tie between Danielson, Nigel, and the Ring of Honor World Champ at the time of this taping (2007), Takeshi Morishima.
  For those of us who grew up worshipping at the altar of stiff monster heels such as Stan Hansen, Bruiser Brody, Big Van Vader, and especially Freebird Terry Gordy (Takeshi's American physical doppleganger), the arrival of Morishima on the ROH scene was a long wanted pleasure. The athleticism and technical ability of the organizations' top talents before the enormous Asian debuted in the States was certainly unquestioned and a deserved source of pride for the upstart company. And I certainly wouldn't claim ROH strictly provided smaller technicians considering the long title reign of 270 pound Samoa Joe.
  But no matter how talented, brutal, and stiff Joe was, he never struck me as a ""Monster"", in the classic pro wrestling sense. But Takeshi Morishima....the term 'Monster Heel' is obviously in his DNA. Competing with the classic rugged style Japan's top stars excelled in during the 1990's, T.M. teaches some youngsters what it felt like to be on the wrong end of a Stan Hansen Lariat, or a Kobashi backdrop suplex. And speaking of 'Lariats', Takeshi's challenger is ROH's acknowledged clothesline King, the incredible Brit Nigel McGuiness. Their title tilt on this night was predictably brutal and unpredictable. It's an easy 4 and a half star classic. Enjoy.",1391817600,,2202,5.019178082191781
