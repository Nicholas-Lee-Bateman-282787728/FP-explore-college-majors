8569161,2,B00BIYQPYM,"It's a below average movie. There's a good story to it, but the movie was very short. It made me feel like there should had been way more to it. I think the budget might had been a problem as the ending felt cut off and there should had been way more scenes to it. I can't really say much about it because then I would give out way too many spoilers, but yeah, I felt there should had been 3 to 5 more scenes because there were all these other scenes that didn't go anywhere with more information about it. So, it's not a happy ending at the end, and it made me feel empty inside because there should had been more to it. I don't recommend this movie, if you don't like movie that give you a ending that has a lot of interpretation.",1388188800,,732,4.02054794520548
8569162,3,B00BIYQPYM,"Good production, so-so acting and no conclusion are a way to sum up this film. It has a plot that i thought was interesting, including lots of crawling around in tunnels on your belly to evade some creepy killers. Some might find it repetitious, but i thought it kept throwing in new twists at just the right moment. A few critics have noted that it doesn't have an ending and i felt the same. I could understand this decision, if the writers had suggested there was still more story to tell, or if they wanted the viewer to feel some sense of hope for the characters. But it's too vague to say either way.",1378166400,,606,4.324561403508772
8569163,4,B00BIYQPYM,"I would say its about 3.5 going on 4 star.

The story itself is good enough, although a bit stereotyped now. A rich businessman, organizes an expedition to find a secret treasure. It does not quite work out, and the rich businessman gets the blame. The people end out in a horror film with a Japanese biological warfare unit. I will not put any spoilers, but I liked the ending.

The acting varied but overall for such a film it is above standard. I liked Ario Bayu performance. He played in Java Heat, and I thought he was pretty good in that too.

The filming is more than good enough.

Do not expect too much and you probably will enjoy it.",1375574400,,643,4.289256198347108
8569164,2,B00BIYQPYM,"A group of researchers travel to a deserted Japanese bunker along with their armed guards in the hopes of uncovering Yamashita legendary gold. What they find, instead, is a twisted science experiment gone horribly wrong, which unleashes undead assassins against the unsuspecting trespassers. If all of this sounds familiar, that's because it is. Writer/Director Steven Sheil lifts the same basic plot and premise from OUTPOST and ships it overseas to post-WWII Japan in a far less appealing film entitled DEAD MINE, from 2012. DEAD MINE frequently quotes THE DESCENT and others, as well, although it does achieve some success in recreating many of the same scare tactics. Thankfully, the film moves along at a brisk pace, with plenty of action to distract from the stolen material. One cannot deny the impressive production designs, either. The mediocre cast does little to gain our sympathies or support, however, so the onset of bloody carnage is a welcomed relief. While it is leagues above other WWII-themed films featuring undead soldiers (we're looking at you, ZOMBIE LAKE), DEAD MINE puts far too much emphasis on action over suspense.

8569165,3,B00BIYQPYM,"The ending leaves you pissed off but surprisingly eager to find out what happened.  Maybe that was what the director intended which is leaving you wanting more to catapult a sequel or just to induce shock effect into the viewer.  Overall, movie was cheesy goodness and entertaining.  Definitely worth a watch if you're into this type of genre.",1370476800,2,343,4.879310344827586
8569166,3,B00BIYQPYM,"A group of explorers enter a cave on an Indonesian island that was once home to a special Japanese bunker. The members of the group have their own reasons for going on the trip, ones that they don't share immediately. As it happens pirates with entrance sealing grenades are also on the island. Out explorers venture into the cave in order to find a way out. They realize this was not an ordinary bunker and one that is still occupied.

If we changed the setting, and made the Japanese into Nazis, then we would have seen this film a half dozen times before. The plot was well put together. There was good diversity within the group, but the characters came off boring. The setting was drab and military gray by design, which made it unexciting.

It is worthy of a rental. Won't be in my collection until it is on some multi-pack.

8569167,4,B00BIYQPYM,"If you've seen either of the films ""Outpost"" or ""Outpost:Black Sun"", than you've seen ""Dead Mine"".

Overall, this isn't a bad movie, certainly not the greatest of the ""Secret Experiment"" genre, but certainly better than some of the other films I have seen (""War of the Dead"" springs to mind).

As the war goes badly for Japan, the sinister Unit 731 of the Imperial Japanese Army looks for ways to prolong the war and engineer the perfect super soldier. (*Pleas note: There are no flashbacks to 1944/45 this is all given in exposition throughout the plot.)

We find ourselves on a seemingly deserted island of pirates in the South Pacific, enter our ""heroes"" a band of mercenaries lead by the stereotypical corporate exec's son who has assembled this mission for reasons which can not fully be disclosed to those involved. We have 4 mercenaries, an ex-British army veteran turned engineer, a Japanese historian, the aforementioned corporate exec's son and his girlfriend who looks totally out of place for this film.

As the film goes on, we learn that the reason this mission was put together was because several months prior a corporate team of researchers stumbled across an Imperial Japanese Army bunker from the Second World War containing documents supposedly leading to the lost treasure of General Yamashita. Soon enough our band comes across the bunker before being forced inside to seek cover from marauding pirates where they are inevitably trapped inside due to the single grenade the blows up the entrance, forcing them to seek another way out.

All in all, this wasn't a bad movie as I said, certainly not the best. (I personally think ""Outpost"" is a much better film comparatively)

The transfer is good, the sound design is good, the acting is what you'd expect for an off beat science fiction film, certainly better than anything SyFy would put on recently. But all in all I kept getting vibes from other movies, I got a ""Congo"" vibe when they're in the bunker looking for the treasure and of course they're being watched/hunted though they don't know this at first. I got an ""Outpost"" vibe when they talk about Unit 731 and the experimentations conducted on Allied POWs.

Put simply, if you can put aside heavy critiques, and get the movie for a reasonable price ($10 and UNDER) then I would definitely say it is worth a buy or at the very least a solid RENT or Netflix watching. This is definitely one of those movies that if you have friends who are into cheesy sci-fi you can have all the fun in the world ripping it and cracking jokes in MST3K fashion.

Transfer=Good
Packaging=Good
Sound Design=Good
Acting=Average
Plot=Average (As I said if you've seen ""Outpost"" or ""Outpost:Black Sun"", you've seen this film.
Price= $10 and under a definite buy (The Cheaper The Better) otherwise a definite solid rent or something to check out on Netflix.
