7001242,5,B00T6KIPO8,"Very sad to see this series end, but happy they offered the last Season on Disc.  The extras are worth the price alone to me.  Wanted this so I would have a complete set in case I want to have a White Collar marathon in the future.  Amazon made sure I got the cheapest price offered and even refunded money to make it so.

7001243,5,B00T6KIPO8,Great series but sad that it ended. Very entertaining show.,1431043200,,59,5.0
7001244,5,B00T6KIPO8,"At the end of the fifth season of White Collar, the shows creator and the USA Network decided to bring the show back for a final season of just six episodes.  While it was time for the show to end, I was sorry since I have loved it from day one.  Fortunately, with everyone agreeing this was the final season, they were able to go out with the incredibly fun season six.

Plus they were able to resolve that cliffhanger.  After all, we had to know just who it was who kidnapped former con man turned FBI asset Neal Cafferty (Matt Bomer).  Meanwhile, his FBI handler Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) is doing everything he can to find Neal with the help of Neals non-fed trusting friend Mozzie (Willie Garson).  When they do find him, Neal unfolds a very risky plan to take down the most notorious criminal organization  in exchange for his freedom.  Will Neal finally earn his freedom?  Or will the plan backfire?

If you aren't familiar with the show, you really don't want to jump in here.  There are connections, comments, and relationships that won't mean much to you.  But really, would you want to jump in to the end of any story?  I wouldnt.

However, fans of the show will love the way they tie up six years of such a great show.  The ending wasn't the one I had hoped for, but it works perfectly for the characters, so I really don't mind.  Along the way, we get twists, turns, and suspense that will keep you glued to the TV for every second.  In other words, its just like always.

What isn't like always is the lack of standalone episodes.  With only six episodes to wrap things up, five of them tie directly into this final story arc.  The only exception focuses on fan favorite Mozzie, and it is the most fun episode of the season.  The rest have their fun moments but are mostly compelling and suspenseful.

While Jones (Sharif Atkins) and Diana (Marsha Thomason) pretty much are involved in the main story and nothing else, Peters wife Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiessen) does get her own sub-plot, one that brings her back to New York City.  Again, it will please fans, but thats all Im saying.

The acting and writing on this show have always been spectacular, and this final season doesnt drop the ball at all.  Its smart, fast moving, and laced with humor at all the right places brought to life by a talented and amazing cast.  You won't be disappointed in the slightest.

The six episodes from season six are included in this two disc set.  They originally aired in widescreen and full surround, and thats how they are presented here.  The bonus features include a retrospective from the cast and crew, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and two audio commentaries on the series finale, both featuring creator Jeff Eastin who is joined on one by stars Tim DeKay and Willie Garson and the other by Matt Bomer.

Its always sad to see a favorite show end, but thats why TV on DVD sets were invented.  I look forward to spending time reliving Neal and Peters cases again, and White Collar season six is the perfect end to their story.",1430870400,24,3029,4.482632541133455

7001252,4,B00T6KIPO8,"Purchased this in order to see the final episodes which I missed. Video quality is quite good, however sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. I had to turn the volume up to max setting in order to hear adequate enough, and even then, if there was any outside noise, i.e. loud music or loud exhaust, I would miss something. Found I had to hook sound through my stereo and use head phones to enjoy the sound. I have noticed that some DVD recordings now a days can do that. I do not know why, but perhaps I will find out some day.
All in all, the last season, especially the last episode, was worth watching.",1496880000,,608,4.205128205128205

7001258,5,B00T6KIPO8,"White Collar is not your typical ""crime tv"" show with countless shootouts. Without giving any spoilers, it's about a brilliant con man, whose past keeps trying to come back and bite him.

7001288,5,B00T6KIPO8,"Naturally, personal taste is all in a TV series. But what I particularly loved about Season 6 of White Collar was how well the writers brought the series to a close with regard to the Matt Bomer/Neal Caffrey character. Hard to imagine any equally satisfying outcome for him.",1454544000,4,274,4.729166666666667

7001293,5,B00T6KIPO8,"After reading previous reviews, I finally found out why there are only 6 episodes to this sixth and final season.  According to previous reviews, the network actually cancelled the show after the fifth season but the showrunners (with a healthy petition from fans) were able to bring back the show for one more season.  The sad part was we only got 6 episodes.

With that being mentioned, the final season brought back all things we love about the show: terrific characters, great plots, New York and a fitting end (although many would argue with me).  Even with this shortened season, the show never suffered from production quality.  Much of the show was still shot outdoors and thats made it so wonderful.  You just cant beat New York in the backdrop (and yes, I know some of the show was shot in Canada).

Peter and Neal are still working together but Neal is always doing something that makes Peter keep up his guard.  But, over the course of five seasons we have seen a change in Peter and Neal.  We truly believe that they care for each other.  As for the rest of the cast, Mozzie, Elizabeth, Clinton and Diane, they have all returned (thankfully) to close out this wonderful show.  We see Neal still using his skills to overcome a problem and Peter walking that razor thin line of being a good FBI agent while letting Neal do his thing.  Im truly going to miss the White Collar team.

This DVD set contains all the extras we have seen in previous sets: Behind The Scenes, Gag Reel and Audio Commentary.

***** minor spoiler ******

I was hoping to learn why the show was cancelled in the audio commentary, but sadly it did not reveal much.  My guess is viewership was shrinking and that is a disappointment because it was such a watchable show.",1452124800,6,1752,4.5495207667731625

7001297,4,B00T6KIPO8,"This series fell flat for me because Neil's character wasn't reformed by his time at the FBI and through his contact with Burke, it just made him a more savvy con-man.

This series was entertaining and as an artist, I enjoyed the visual landscape and all of the art that was featured in the episodes.",1449187200,,300,4.454545454545454

Loved the series, but felt like it ended with a bit of a whimper. The Pink Panther plot was excellent, and the resolution of that was handled very well. Neal and Mozzie are at their best as they attempt to scam the scammers while securing Neal's ultimate release from the FBI. That being said, none of us liked the final resolution. No spoilers, just be prepared to be underwhelmed by the last parts of the final episode.",1444089600,,585,4.4766355140186915

It's beautiful to see how everything from beginning to ending makes such a nice show for the last few years. Although I started watching in 2014, you can really see the change in the serie through the years. And that's something which gives it a realistic feeling. It kinda gives you the feeling it has been on tv longer already, which is really unique and nice. I can't even name which character is best, because they are all very good, but if I had to choose I liked Elizabeth, Peter and Neal & Mozzie most I think :)

The conclusion I suppose was appropriate but I wish it did not have to end. It is always well written and I love it when a theme carries through a whole season.

Extras includes a couple of commentary tracks and deleted scenes plus another great gag reel and a nice wrap-up of the series that was altogether all too short at just over four minutes.

After six seasons, I'm going to miss these characters. Very underrated series that had a ton of humor and good storylines plus what a cast!",1437350400,,519,4.4526315789473685

I did find it hard to believe that Neal did not include Mozzie in on his plan to fake his death to escape. I thought that was the weak part of the episode. I enjoyed this series. The writers gave the viewer an insight into the friendships between Peter and Neal and Neal and Mozzie. I enjoyed the acting, the photography of the New York architecture and the beautiful clothes the women wore.

7001363,5,B00T6KIPO8,"This season is actually for the fans and the story.  White Collar was cancelled after season 5.  However the final episode in Season 5 has Neal being kidnapped with a bag thrown over his head.  There have been shows in the past where the network exec's just let it go, the guys at White Collar fought to get an extension to close the plotline.  These 6 episodes are it.  Discs have good production value.  Clear images and no skips.

Season 6 episodes

76  ""Borrowed Time""
Peter brings Rebecca in to help locate Neal, who is being held captive by one of her former associates, Jim Boothe. Meanwhile, Jim wastes no time letting Neal know that if he doesn't comply with his demands he'll be pushed down an elevator shaft. Jim has lofty aspirations of joining an exclusive group of thieves, The Pink Panthers, and his entry ticket is the diamond currently held by the FBI. He needs Neal to steal it back. But Neal has a better plan - he thinks the situation calls for a grander gesture, and, for his trouble, he expects something in return. Elizabeth tells Peter that she is pregnant. Rebecca, upon leaving white collar, takes an agent's gun which leaves the second agent no choice but to shoot her, killing her in the end. As Neal says, ""She made a choice. For Her, it was better to risk almost certain death than go back to jail.""

77 ""Return to Sender""
The U.S. Attorney General signs off on a contract, written by Mozzie, guaranteeing Neal's freedom if he helps take down the Panthers. Neal goes to his first meeting with them, without his anklet, and is surprised to meet Keller, who according to Russian authorities is still in one of their prisons. The Panthers assign Neal to steal a stamp about to be auctioned by an Argentine woman. Neal and Peter obtain admission to the auction by posing as a reclusive father and son, and Neal successfully takes the stamp in spite of a sophisticated security system. But the FBI will not release the stamp, so Neal makes a forgery which Keller vouches for. Neal deduces that Keller is an undercover Interpol informant, and confirms this with him, agreeing that neither can afford to expose the other. The Panthers tell Neal that the purpose of his theft of the stamp was to test the security system in preparation for a bigger job. Mozzie deduces that Elizabeth is pregnant, and Peter later tells Neal.

78  ""Uncontrolled Variables""
The Panthers assign Keller and Neal to copy a data disk from a safe in a security firm's office. Neal cultivates Amy, the assistant to the firm's head, and gets Mozzie into the safe, but the disk uses 1970's technology and Mozzie must take it home to read it. Before they can get it back to the safe, Amy's boss returns early from a trip and discovers it missing. Neal suggests that Amy confess to taking it to expose the security weakness, then ask for a promotion. Instead she quits her job in disgust and Neal is broken-hearted at having betrayed her. Keller and his Interpol handler Luc give the disk to the Panthers, and the FBI are able to interpret it as instructions to route some high-value cargo randomly through US airports.

79  ""All is Fair""
Five years ago, while Neal was in prison, Mozzie met, worked with, and married a con artist named Eva before she swindled and abandoned him. Now Eva is back, asking for a divorce so she can marry Jack, a wealthy man who has recently devoted his life to charity. Neal and Peter determine that Eva and Jack are working together and plan to steal a Faberge egg, leaving Mozzie as the fall guy. They stop the theft, but Mozzie allows Eva to escape, without signing the divorce papers. Meanwhile, the FBI figure out that the Panthers' target is a plane bringing hundreds of millions in cash back from Europe, to a random airport determined by the stolen algorithm. Peter has the San Francisco FBI stake out the latest plane, but the Panthers don't show because, as Woodford tells Neal at June's house, they know that they have a mole.

80  ""Whack a Mole""
Woodford does not know who the mole is, but he is sure it is not Neal since a spy bug was found before Neal joined the group. Neal refuses to help find the mole, making Woodford trust him even more and reveal the plan to steal the cash from the airport via a massive armed assault. Peter finds that the spy bug was planted by Luc to spy on Keller, and he asks Luc to pull Keller off of the operation. Peter, Mozzie and Neal brainstorm ways the Panthers could steal the cash less dangerously, until Peter hits on the idea of using pneumatic tubes built decades ago to move mail out of the airport. Luc finds out Neal is hiding something and decides to disobey Peter and leave Keller on the operation. Keller kills Luc and puts his own tracking chip on Woodford's deputy, who is then killed by Woodford. The FBI and Interpol agree to keep the operation going so Luc's death won't be in vain. Peter misses the appointment with Elizabeth to view the first sonogram of their son, and vows to her that he will never let anything else be a priority. Mozzie begs Neal to be introduced to the Pink Panthers, but Neal refuses, telling him it's not the right time. Since the Panthers are now one man short, Neal brings Peter to the meeting stating he's the one who's been helping him. Woodford responds by aiming his gun at Peter.

81  ""Au Revoir""
The Panthers' plan proceeds as planned except for two things: Mozzie intercepts a portion of the cash by opening the pneumatic tube in a tunnel, and the FBI arrest everyone at the end. Neal and Keller sneak away from Peter and meet Mozzie in the tunnel, where Keller betrays their arrangement and apparently shoots Neal in a struggle. Peter arrives, kills the fleeing Keller, and finds Neal being taken away in an ambulance. Later, at the hospital, he and Mozzie view what appears to be Neal's lifeless body. Some time later, after Peter and El's son Neal is born, a mysterious delivery of a bottle of fine wine inspires Peter to search out a storage container, which contains the evidence that Neal faked his death. The series ends with Neal Caffrey in Paris, seeking out some new adventure.",1436054400,4,6111,4.555150410209663

Very disappointed that the producers chose these scenes and think they're funny.  Not for children or youngsters. Well, not even for some of us adults.

Puts a ripple in moral judgment to be rooting for the con artists . . . emphasis on artists.  But Peter and his crew were always there helping keep things in balance.

This resolves the cliffhanger from season 5, letting us know who kidnapped Neal Caffrey and why and segues into the wrap up of the series.  Mozzie has an unexpected revelation in an episode and Elizabeth Burke returns from Washington, D.C., to rejoin Peter with life-changing news.
