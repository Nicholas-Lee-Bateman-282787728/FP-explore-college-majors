7808488,4,6300273490,"We love the old ""Superman"" series. The first season in black and white was deadly serious action-socko stuff, with scary bad guys and action plots, including one grisly episode where Supe basically condemns a crooked couple who won't stop threatening to expose his secret identity to their death by leaving them atop an icy mountain (whoops, they slide off... YEEEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHhhh--SPLAT). But in the color episodes, the spirit of the show changes to a campy comic book sensibility in the spirit of the ""APPROVED"" McCarthy era comic censor boards' conception of child-friendly media. This includes one memorable scene where a fleeing villain is retrieved by the Man of Steel not by simply flying a few dozen yards to snatch him up, but by using a powerful magnet to pull him back by aiming it at the ""metal plate in his head,"" through the newly discovered magic of reversing the film. The bad guys in ""The Big Freeze"" are hysterical. We had taped this one on tv and watched it a hundred times.

What we REALLY need to see is the COMPLETE SERIES on DVD, at least the color seasons (FIRST)... Because of its level of humor and campiness, whichever season included the ""Big Freeze"" would be a great start if there is only a willingness to leak them out one season at a time, an unfortunate method of DVD'ing old tv shows. Don't they understand that many of those of us who would collect these will wait for the whole series to be offered?",1100822400,6,1437,4.679841897233201
7808489,4,6300273490,"Volume 3 of ""TV's Best Adventures of Superman"" offers up a couple of episodes from the syndicated television series starring George Reeves that ran from 1952-1957.  First up is ""Panic in the Sky"" (Episode #38), where an asteroid not only causes floods and earthquakes, it gives Superman amnesia.  Then in ""The Big Freeze"" (Episode #68), crooked politicians led by Duke Taylor (George F. Stone) take over Metropolis and plan on freezing Superman to keep him out of the way.  Sandwiched in between the two television episodes is the 1941 Fleischer Studios Superman cartoon ""The Magnetic Telescope,"" in which an astronomer invents this telescope that ends up drawing an asteroid towards Earth.  Obviously they picked this cartoon for this particular volume because it matches up nicely with ""Panic in the Sky.""  These are representative episodes from ""the Adventures of Superman,"" but I would not call any of them classics.",1009152000,5,920,5.1891891891891895
