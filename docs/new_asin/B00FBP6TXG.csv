Not a good movie.",1392681600,2,129,5.142857142857143

8614082,5,B00FBP6TXG,I entirely enjoyed this reality depiction of the gospel. The producers were spot on with what the Bible says. This is a must see.,1465084800,3,129,4.416666666666667
8614083,3,B00FBP6TXG,"This is a fictional story based loosely on the gospel according to Matthew. It is about ten people who received a healing from Jesus earlier in his brief life. The fiction begins when they are all there at his crucifixion and remember the moment of their miracle, so the movie is a time warp, back and forth. So, while it quotes Matthew and Isaiah, and recounts some of the actual miracles Jesus performed, it is fiction.

It is low budget cinematography where everybody in the family gets to play a part or operate a camera. In the credits, the same last names just about fill the cast and crew. Scenes, dialogue, and characters stray pretty far from Matthew's gospel. They used a lush, grassy hill with shade trees for Golgotha. Someone would have benefited from doing a little geographical research. The eyeliner, colored eye shadow, foundation, blush, and colored hair was very modern day America, as though the director allowed the cast to do their own make-up. However, the costumes were very good.

The work of a female writer/director who was also the film editor, and producer, and probably more, a lot of female cast members played their parts like liberal American women on PMS at a women's rights rally, screaming and punching at the Pharisees and Roman soldiers who endure this abuse at the crucifixion. Anyone familiar with the history of first century Judea would know you don't mess with Roman soldiers, the women were Jews, and they'd simply be silenced, with force, and banned from the synagogue, which would be equivalent to being cast out of society for the rest of your life. But all this chaos does pull you into the horrific drama and trauma of watching our Savior being tortured. The writer perpetuates the myth that Mary Magdalene is the adulteress who escapes being stoned by Jesus' intercession. And she added a young boy, probably to create a part in the movie for someone in the family, who comes around with a bucket of wine and a sop for the three on the crosses, and has a lot to say to one of the thieves. There was a young blonde, with looked like she just stepped out of a salon, who was reading Old Testament scripture and looked so out of place in supposedly Jerusalem at a crucifixion, it was hard to take the reading seriously. The movie ends at Jesus' tomb on Easter Sunday, and closes on a close up of Mary Magdalene's smiling face. It should have focused on Jesus and the Resurrection, in my humble opinion.

HOWEVER, you take the bad with the good. For those of us who believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Messiah, there is no such thing as a bad Jesus movie. It does present a very dramatic presentation of Christ and the possible emotions of His followers, and it is moving, for all its faults. It brings out some refreshing script revealing how perhaps Jesus' disciples would have reacted, as they were traumatized and confused (even though in the gospels the only disciple at the Crucifixion was John.) Paul Presly plays Jesus and he carries the ball for the rest of the team.

From its perspective, it is refreshingly different from other Jesus movies. The scene of the Nativity was excellent, portraying Mary and Joseph as adoring loving parents. The baby Jesus is precious. And there are other scenes that are well done and well acted, and make the errors forgivable. This one holds your heart. I would recommend it, and I'll watch it again, but I don't think of it as an award winning film. And I wouldn't recommend showing it to children who would then consider it gospel truth. Please remember, it is FICTION.",1456358400,3,3575,4.6608557844690965
8614084,5,B00FBP6TXG,"Great movie.
Going to re-watch right now

The Faith Box Is simply put .
GORGEOUS.
 My Grandson is gonna love it. He will be Baptized  March 5th.
I got him a 118 year old leather bound copy of Desire of Ages  by Ellen G White to go in book slot as well. Fits perfect.
It really illuminates the wall . Perfect night light.
Got the brass inscription plate.
That really personalizes  the gift. Very easy to put together,not much to do with it.
 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
If your thinking about purchasing the Faith Box ?
Don't hesitate. You will not be disappointed.",1455148800,,556,4.401960784313726
8614085,1,B00FBP6TXG,I really wanted to like this one. But the production and acting are really sub par.  There was good intentions but sadly the execution falls short.,1431475200,,147,4.653846153846154
8614086,5,B00FBP6TXG,"You must watch this film, it even won awards at the international movie festival ! Oh yeah and Jesus lives.",1400544000,7,107,4.4
8614087,5,B00FBP6TXG,"Though as was mentioned by another reviewer, this was a low-budget film, the vision, directing, screenplay, producing, editing, and some camera work was done by one person, who must be an amazing woman to have done all that.

The film's message and presentation of the message was very good.  I really had a feel for the mental anguish that Jesus faced as a man.  It also gives a unique perspective of those people Jesus touched.",1399420800,7,429,4.693333333333333
8614088,3,B00FBP6TXG,"Appears to be a film made on a limited budget.  Always a good subject and made with good intent, but I am always looking for engaging DVDs for my religious ed kids, and this isn't quite making the cut.",1397260800,2,201,4.153846153846154
