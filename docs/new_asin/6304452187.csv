877015,2,6304452187,"I rented this video some time back to see what the fuss was all about. After watching it, I was rather disappointed. Except for all the colorful unbleeped language and uncensored buttocks and mammaries (some of the  ugliest ones I've ever witnessed on video), just about everything on this  video had already been shown on the TV show! There was next to no new  material.
There was one moment of the rare new footage that I found  rather memorable, however. Two police cars collide at an intersection while  driving to the same crime scene. Both cars had COPS camera crews riding in  them, with film rolling the whole time. When I saw the footage of the  collision from the passenger-seat point-of-view, I could actually feel the  impact.
I guess it really IS reality television!

877016,5,6304452187,Excellent Video!  If you love COPS the show then this is a must have Video for your collection,950832000,2,94,4.222222222222222
877017,1,6304452187,"What a disappointment!  If you watch ""Cops"" much, you've seen this all before, just with the expletives bleeped out and the nudity (ugly people anyways) blurred.
For the cost of the video, you get to see what  you've already figured out.  Big deal.",947203200,,248,4.72093023255814

7871230,4,6304452187,"I am not one of those people who watched this show a lot. Maybe when it first came out. So when I watched this, it was all new to me. And let me tell you, this is hilarious!!! It's been over 20 years now and I'm still finding myself quoting from it. Not that anyone has any idea that I am.

Seriously, I'm not recommending that you buy this, but if you saw it at a garage sale for $2 I would scoop that up!",1476230400,,406,3.776470588235294

7871234,3,6304452187,"Makes a good rental. I bought it good/used since it was less than a buck. It's entertaining, but it's awfully short for how long the show has been on and how many episodes they have made. What they really should do is not focus on the ""too hot for Tv"" since there isn't all that many of those moments, and concentrate new video releases on themes, like they do often with the aired episodes. Like, make a compilation of police chases, odd arrests, guns drawn, drug stings, domestics, ect., and make a solid hour and a half or two hour feature of each.",1326758400,,551,4.359223300970874
7871235,3,6304452187,"This is another video of the ""Cops"" series. I always watch ""Cops"" no matter what. It's my favorite TV show. If you like ""Cops"", you've probably seen this stuff before. It's funny though. So rent it today. Then if you like it, buy it!
Rated: NR (Not Rated). But contains Adult Language and Graphic Nudity. Adult Supervision is extremely advised. Thanks!

7871236,1,6304452187,This video is a HUGE [disappointment]! It claims to be uncensored and 'Too Hot For TV' but isn't. Some of it is uncensored (mainly the profanity and some nudity) but most of it is not. It's mainly the same stuff you see on the TV show. There's nothing real special about this video at all. Save your money.,1042243200,6,306,4.293103448275862
7871237,2,6304452187,"It is a 38 minutes short video tape including scenes that can not be on regular TV because have frequent ""F, B words"", and brief nudity: fuzzy around ""without pants"" old male, topless women.
It was nice to appreciate the strange and peculiar risks that law enforcing officers must face: on the loose cows, chicken, spitting, ugly dentures, those forced me to give it two stras, not one.
Honestly, was nothing worth wasting 38 minutes.",1012176000,4,434,4.8
7871238,2,6304452187,"I own this because I was one of the many who ordered it after it was advertised on the Cops TV show. I didn't know quite what to expect except that it was stuff ""too hot"" for TV. I didn't expect blood and guts, or X-rated stuff but felt it would show a slew of different segments. This video is essentially material they couldn't show on tv because -- in a few instances -- it was too violent or showed some nudity. But portions of this video were also shown on Cops, except with some editing cuts. Other portions  of this is stuff that could be shown on Cops. I really felt when I watched this that I had been dumb to order it and others I lent it to felt the same way. I haven't even listed this on Amazon to sell second hand because, to be honest, I'd feel like I snookered someone else. Save your money, folks!",999820800,7,814,4.0875
