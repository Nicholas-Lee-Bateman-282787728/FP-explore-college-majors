7813688,1,6301686691,"A married couple moves into a house where a married couple had killed themselves. The place is haunted with low budget effects that lack any scare. The acting was not good....to be kind. Has some camp/ MST-3000 value.

No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1477008000,,247,4.744186046511628

I don't really know what to say about this movie, except
its very boring-- about 2 newlyweds who purchase a house
that the previous owners commited suicide in-- now their
souls have possessed the house for the newlyweds to live in...
SPOILERS
Lamps move by themselves, record moves by itself, stove
turns on on it's own, guy gets saur krout pulled from his
chest (were supposed to think it's the man's intestines being
pulled out)--
I wasn't scared of this, I didn't laugh- just when an axe
decapitates a very obvious mannequin(supposed to be a lady)--
This rental is worth 50 cents-- I just shut it off and took it back, good one to make fun of, and to nitpick on all the
fakeness throughout!!!!",1078876800,,743,4.636363636363637
