Especially noticeable when the viewer watches from a camera that is pretty much dropped and recovered for several seconds, and when the guitarist's vocals are not audible even though the camera is filming him.  It's possible the engineers wanted to make sure the distorted guitar shoegaze sound doesn't prevent the other instruments from being heard, and so (especially at the beginning of the dvd) the female vocals, drums, and bass are prominent in the mix.  I do enjoy watching this dvd because there is no other dvd of Asobi Seksu available, and I love Asobi Seksu's music.  The poor quality of the recording can also make watching the dvd feel more authentic and not overproduced.",1391990400,,783,4.909090909090909
8325798,1,B000V78PJU,"I'm a fan of Asobi Seksu and especially their Citrus album, but this dvd done by Baeble music was a huge let down.  Not because of the band, but the filming is terrible and the sound is pathetic.  The venue which is some sort of waterpark or pool is a poorly chosen one.  The length is barely more than 30 mins.  Save your money Asobi Seksu fans, I wish I had.",1222992000,2,360,4.028169014084507
