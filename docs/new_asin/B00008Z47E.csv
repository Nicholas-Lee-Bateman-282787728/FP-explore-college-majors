The Final Gate
This dvd gives you the last 3 episodes of the ova/sequel, GateKeepers 21. This dvd gives these episodes:
(People who were paying attention to the first dvd, will notice that the opening song and ending song have switched places)
Episode 4, Ayane(yes Ayane,not Ayone):Ayane meets up with the GateKeeper's new ally, Satoka Tachikawa,who has the Gate of Blades. She questions Ayane about her changing her name from Ukiya to Isuzu. Yep, that's right Ayane is Shun's daughter! Then we all get to see the return and fall (again) of Akuma Hakushaku.
Episode 5,Miu(is it Mee-oo or Mew?):This is 5 weeks after the events in ep. 4, Ayane is in a coma and Miu has made friends with Yukino. Miu finds out from Mr. Kageyama that Ayane,thought hating humans, had collected hundreds of Invader crystals. Ghost Girl breaks in and after giving a lesbian kiss to Ayane(@_@)steals the crystals back and turns everyone into invaders.
Episode 6,Hane-Oto(Hey, thats the end song!): Invaders are gathering everywhere,and they say that nothing can sway them (cough*Megumi*cough). while Ayane sleeps, Miu tells her about her dreams. Yukino confronts Ghost Girl, though her effort was futile and she-...Ayane awakens and she and Miu , with their combined gates, make it to the Ghost girl. Ayane , then uses her gate to defeat the Ghost Girl. Ghost Girl tries to eliminate Ayane using her gate of disappearance but since she turned it negative, it revived everyone and everything.
This may not answer EVERY single mind-numbing question, it answers some. Though an unknown source could answer those questions...cough*GateKeepers 1985 novel*cough.
