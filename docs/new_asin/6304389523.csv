7870943,1,6304389523,"I had never seen this film, Long Pants, before. I was hoping to like it after watching the Strong Man and Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, however, I found this film repugnant. It is almost totally void of humor. It is more a a melodrama in the vain of Sunrise than a silent comedy. Langdon's character is totally immoral and has no values. He plots the murder of his fianc on his appointed wedding day in order to run off with a convicted dope smuggler. He not only plots the death of his longtime girlfriend, but actually makes an attempt to carry it out by luring her into the woods to execute her with a pistol. Although he fails to kill her, it is only after he made several attempts to do so. There is an excruciatingly long scene where he tries to get a dummy, that that is dressed as a policeman, to move away from a large box that it is sitting on. Buster Keaton had already used a dummy to much better effect and much more sublimely in Hard Luck. Before the film was over, I was ready to fall asleep, and it is only 58 minutes. Sadly, this is a very disappointing film.",1466985600,,1067,4.209756097560976
7870944,4,6304389523,"Harry Langdon is often labeled ""The Fourth Silent Genius"" by historians, but it seems that people either love him or just don't get it. This film is certainly not the one you want to see to fall in love with him. However, it is a sweet movie on its own merits.

The story concerns a young man (Langdon) whose family has kept him in short pants for his whole life. They believe it will keep him innocent and out of trouble. It seems they were right; when he gets long pants he falls in love with a troublesome but beautiful girl (Alma Bennett). Although he is engaged to another (Priscilla Bonner) (who he is willing to do anything to get rid of), he follows the beauty everywhere including to jail and out again in a crate.

There are some classic gags utilized, some belly laughs to be had, but also a rather disturbing scene of comedy rooted in murder. This is one silent comedy you might want to ban your children from.",1148169600,,922,4.354651162790698
7870945,1,6304389523,"This is the film that practically destroyed Harry Langdon's career. Supposedly a comedy it has nothing going for it. Frank Capra disowned this disaster and it's easy to see why. Langdon's comedic characater was very fragile and had to be carefully handled. This film oblitertes it. To appreciate Langdon's talent get The Strong Man, a classic Capra comedy in which Langdon shines and one that the great director was very proud of.",1029283200,2,430,4.986111111111111
7870946,5,6304389523,"I have never laughed harder or longer at anything than Baby Face Harry Langdon starring in the comic masterpiece ""Saturday Afternoon"".  What was most surprising to me was it would definately be rated  ""PG-13"" if released today- and that's a good thing!  Never  offensive, but not too too tame either.  My six year old son couldn't stop  laughing and my grandparents are still talking about it.  I'm sorry, but  nothing out today can touch this stuff.  It's timeless, it's hilarious and  the video transfer is amazing.",954201600,3,517,4.906976744186046
7870947,3,6304389523,"In ""Long Pants"" the Langdon character starts to come apart at its seams-Harry does things that are not in character and a lot of this film does not work well. At times, you may scratch your head trying to  figure out the inconsistencies here between the child like Langdon and his  murderous impulses. ""Saturday Afternoon"", however, is a comic  gem-as perfect and delightful a comedy short as was made in the 1920's.",951436800,,416,4.75
