8330632,1,B001OI7A1Y,"The DVD ""The Trigonometry Tutor: Finding Trig Functions Using the Unit Circle"" is merely part of Jason Gibson's ""The Trigonometry and Pre-Calculus Tutor"" repackaged with a few minutes of video that advertise ""TMW Media Group"" and hype Jason's presentation.  Jason Gibson's ""Trigonometry And Pre-Calculus Tutor"" is also sold on Amazon and given the current pricing (about $36 for ""The Trigonometry Tutor"" and about $32 for the ""The Trigonometry And Pre-Calculus Tutor""), it makes no sense to buy ""The Trigonometry Tutor"".

If you want to see a review of the material on this DVD, please see my review of ""The Trigonometry And Pre-Calculus Tutor"".  This DVD only contains the part of that material where Jason makes a table of the trig functions of ""the special angles"" and talks briefly about the inverse trig functions for the special angles (about 57 minutes of instruction).

I rate this product as one star out of five to indicate it is a sleazy ""slice and dice"" repackaging of a more complete product.",1285804800,,1005,5.0
