2603303,1,B000GAKFIG,"I'm a die-hard Agatha Christie Fan and am at this time reading her Miss Marple books.  I was thrilled to see that PBS was releasing a new Miss Marple series, and I watched each segment.  However, I could find very little of Christie's taut plots, fully dimensional characters and wonderful endings in any of these.  The Scripts are so confusing with many characters changed, some left out and even time-lines different.  The dialogue is appalling.  A constant flow of recognizable older British actors should have guaranteed some quality, but their abilities were completely overtaken with one-dimensional characterizations.  There's no intelligence here.  Did any Christie ""fan"" note that Miss Marple never appeared in ""By the Pricking of My Thumbs"" or ""The Sittaford Mystery""?  How do the writers handle this??  Just plop Miss Marple in, change the plot and give her the lines originally  made for another character.  I have the biggest problem with ""The Sittaford Mystery.""  It's absolutely grotesque.  Back lighted in tasteless, psychadelic reds and greens the sets look like a bad acid trip.  Then they tilt the camera angles to really make you nauseous (if you weren't already).  Geraldine McEwan probably could have made a good Miss Marple because she is a good actress.  But like all others here, she can't rise above the dreadful scripts and direction.  They have her twittering, crinkling her eyes, and acting so silly that there's no way you can believe that this Miss Marple could find her way to the loo, very much figure out the murder.  So why call it Agatha Christie's Miss Marple if you change the plots, characters, and settings?  Ah....that's the real mystery!!  But of course it doesn't take a brain at all to realize it's for the money.  Oh well.  It's all a matter of taste.  I can tell you one thing for sure.  I won't waste my money on this disappointing mess.",1186617600,18,1884,4.907936507936508
2603304,3,B000GAKFIG,"I find myself in general agreement with those who look askance at this new Miss Marple series.

The simple and painfully unavoidable fact is that the new writers do not respect Dame Aggie, and they show it in each limping episode.  It is entirely conceivable that the originals might be tightened up or changed for the better--but not by these insensitive hacks, and not here.  Every change, every decision made by the new team plainly distorts and weakens these time-tested stories.

The writers and producers of the old Margaret Rutherford series had no more respect for Christie's writing.  And she, herself, made it clear what her reaction to that was.  However, they had a true force of nature in Rutherford.  That superannuated but true star created an entirely new and wonderful character whose only fault was that she shared her name with an Agatha Christie heroine.

Geraldine McEwan is no Margaret Rutherford.  She is an oddly retiring Miss Marple who does little more than twinkle from the corner and becomes increasingly irrelevant in each episode.

These new productions are the work of anti-alchemists.  They are converting gold to lead.",1174003200,16,1151,5.037037037037037
2603305,3,B000GAKFIG,"Series 2 is slightly better than series 1.  The actors seem to be enthsiastic in doing their roles, the wardrobe department has supplied costumes tha fit the body shapes of the acting people. On the negative side the programs continue to violate the Hollywood code of conduct by promoting the smoking of cigarettes amongst the public by showing characters smoking.  It also has the inverted social structure.  People who would be expected to be competent and gracious are not.

Two of the four programs have never been dramatized on video format in the 50 years since they were written. These are a must have for Christie video collectors.",1173571200,4,639,4.888888888888889

2603307,5,B000GAKFIG,"I've been a Christie fan since childhood and loved the early movies in spite of Rutherford's handling of the character.  I loved Joan Hickson's portrayal of Miss Marple and never thought anyone else could ""be"" Miss Marple for me.  Therefore I expected to be disappointed with these new releases.  I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED, I LOVE THIS NEW VERSION!  After I cautiously viewed the first episode I came to fully appreciate Geraldine McEwan in the role.  She is subtle, confident and highly adroit and I find her refreshing and wonderful.  The stories themselves are entertaining and intriquing.  Some reviewers complained that the scripts don't stick to the originals, but this is not an issue for me here.  Christie's stories stay alive and fun even after having been done so often because they aren't always done the same way.  Any tweaks to the storylines keep the material fresh and even improve it at times.  I think it's fun to be surprised by my old favorites!  Hooray for Geraldine McEwan!  I hope to see many more Miss Marple stories with her in the title role!",1161388800,42,1064,4.785714285714286
2603308,1,B000GAKFIG,"""Christie as you have never seen her before"" was a claim that made me a little nervous, but I decided to try these ""new"" mysteries anyway.  Sometimes a new approach can be helpful.

Alas, I discovered this ""new Christie"" is simply a chance for the writers of these stories to stick their 21st Century values on an older generation.  Bright young things always claim they are so different from their parents, but they want to paint their grandparents as they are themselves.

The first set of this new series was disturbing enough.  There were subtile changes here and there that distracted from the story.  What was a small adventure into so-called ""new areas"" in the first series is an all-out march into the world of today in this second series.

Sleeping Murder is not longer the story of poor Helen who, like the Helen of the old stories, could not find happiness in life because of her beauty.  For those who have read Christie, this was a theme she used in more than one plot.  The Helen of this movie is not longer a beautiful young woman searching everywhere for love, only to have it snatched for her grasp before she can enjoy her treasure; instead this Helen is a petty thief with a smirk that always leaves the viewer wondering what she is planning.  The story is not the tale of young newlyweds coming to England to buy a home in which to start their married life, but instead the tale of a summer acting group that were saved from certain career disaster by the arrival of World War II.  The young newlyweds are not newlyweds but only an engaged gal that demands and snaps at people until her discovery that she knows things about this house that she should not  only give her another reason to complain.  The young husband never appears in the story, in fact he is dispatched from the script in favor of what is supposed to be a flunkie of the company come to help her buy the house and settle in before the wedding.  One wonders at the ending as the flunkie will be out of a job when his boss hears the wedding is off and then where will they all be?

The relationships between these characters are what one might expect from a modern day acting group and not from a pre-war one.  The disclosure of the murderer seems to be an: ""Oh yes, this is a murder tale so we had better make one of these people a murderer.""  And the murder itself is silly rather than tragic.

These ""new"" stories center around gay couples and estranged couples and broken-hearted singles.  There are few married couples.  And the writers simply cannot bear to keep Christie's love stories within the episodes.  No, those have to be tossed in favor of some ""new"" approach to the ending.  Christie's stories were so much about the character of humans and why they act the way they do.  Each detail of her stories helped to express her view on what motivated humans to love and to kill.  The freely changing of some of these details destroys an important part of the story.  One could and should expect some changes to keep the story fresh but those changes should express Christie's views and not the popular views of the moment.  The twisted end to 4:50 From Paddington in no way expressed the point Christie made by developing the relationship of Bryan and the new cook.  When that point was removed for the story, then the family became only a group of greedy people grasping for the old man's money, and not a family whose outlook on life had been so changed by their father's character and actions.  With no contrast between Bryan and the others, the point was last and watching the story became pointless as well.

I would say to the writers of these movies:  There is a reason that Dame Agatha has out-sold God, and you have completely missed the point of that reason.  Why is it that you cannot have a married couple in any of your stories?  Of what are you afraid?  We expect our elected leaders to have good characters and be upstanding citizens, but the total disregard of some values by the entertainment medium is totally appaling.  Christie wrote about life and about people as they are.  The fact that you are using her name and her reputation to tell your own tale tells us so much about you.  And Christie taught us how to understand you.

Let me see if I can explain the basic concept of the murder tale.  Evil people kill and/or are killed.  Innocent people suffer because of the murder.  If your suffering characters are such that nobody cares about them, then nobody is going to give a darn how much they suffer.  And by the time Sleeping Murder was over, I had completely lost interest.  Her end was understandable.

And may I ask why she was buried under a dead tree?",1160524800,82,4678,4.479905437352246
2603309,5,B000GAKFIG,"Having been a fan of Agatha Christie from the sixties and a fan of Joan Hickson since her first episode as Miss Marple, I expected to find it hard to switch allegiances to Geraldine McEwan. But, as Anthony Andrews says in one of the many featurettes in this delightful second set, Christie has become a 'canon', open to the interpretation and the creativity of writers, directors and actors. McEwan (Marple) is wonderful. She brings energy and humor to the role, making Marple's all-knowing attitude one of wisdom and kindliness. I love revisiting my favorite British actors in the various roles (ala 'Murder She Wrote'). I am also glad this new production is branching out into new territory. ""The Sittaford Mystery"" was brilliantly done, lots of nice camera angles, spooky snow storm and Gothic darkness. I'm sure Christie would have loved it, even if they took liberties with the plot. ""By the Pricking of My Thumbs"" was also good (Tommy and Tuppence all grown up) and a good attempt at suspense here as well. The other two. . . well. ""Sleeping Murder"" makes the same mistake that often comes out of the fantasies of male writers - a beautiful woman will fall in love with a plain man with no money. That is certainly true in real life - in this production, it's hard to see the attraction and the story falls flat. ""The Moving Finger"" held no surprises - same as every other production, but the scenery and the houses were beautiful. It's a shame that Christie, who liked Marple so much better than Poirot, wrote fewer stories about her. I would like to see McEwan continue in this role for years and years and years. . .",1157241600,25,1625,4.645833333333333
2603310,3,B000GAKFIG,"The accomplished actress Geraldine McEwan stars as the spinster sleuth Jane Marple, who lives in the picturesque little village of St. Mary Mead. Pleasant and full of life, Ms. Marple often becomes interested if murder or mayhem rears its ugly head in her vicinity. She's come to earn the respect of many in Scotland Yard, and makes friends easier than you can snap your fingers. With these new productions, its a pleasure to watch her solve the crimes.

This new series of Marple stories takes liberties with the original stories penned by Agatha Christie, to varying effect. In ""Sleeping Murder,"" which had its own implausibilities to begin with, the way the story was changed makes it harder to follow and detracts from the overall feel of it. In the case of ""By the Pricking of My Thumbs,"" however, the alterations to the original story weren't so bad. Perhaps that is due to my unfamiliarity with the book, but I thought that this production was very well done, and quite suspenseful.

Credit is given to this new production of Miss Marple for making ""The Moving Finger"" a smashing good ride. I've never found the previous TV or radio adaptations to be that engaging, but this version was quite good, building the tension as it went along. Alas, ""The Sittaford Mystery"" has been changed so much from the book that I can not support it. Perhaps this is an example of being too familiar with the original?

The direction and pacing of each Marple story is usually pretty well done. The set and costume designs are exquisite. The casting is typically top-notch, and each episode is like a who's who of familiar British actors. The theme music is lively and memorable, and overall the series is enjoyable. It just needs to become a little more even in its presentation, and it would be that much better.

--- Matthew Gladney",1152748800,49,1825,4.747634069400631
2603311,2,B000GAKFIG,"Sleeping Murder seems to refer mostly to what was done to the original book. Obviously considering Christie's mysteries too mannerly, the scriptwriters invented a troupe of actors who sleep around with each other, then changed the step-sister in the plot to a real sister so some incest could be added; by the time the heroine breaks off her engagement to her fiance, it is a mild denoument, but at least consistent.

In By the Pricking of My Thumbs, Miss Marple is injected into a plot where she is totally unncessary; and rather than the happy, intelligent couple we know from Christie's books, we are presented with Tommy as a bumbling, insensitive beaurocrat and Tuppence as a depressed boozer (with some unexpected company, since the local clergyman is also an alcoholic, of course).

The Moving Finger is much better in plot alignment, even though it opens showing the hero writhing in bed with various women (thankfully, only one at a time). But here the costume production details were messed up pretty badly: the (very) busty governess is about to explode from the low-cut cocktail dress she is wearing early in the morning as she oversees her young charges (in which any sudden movement would certainly have added graphically to their education); and when the hero's sister is shown seated at a formal dinner party eating with her gloves on, I laughed aloud; who made this episode, 21st century Americans?

All of this is a real shame, since a lot of thought and money obviously went into the period detail, and the acting is top-notch; but the representation of 1950's behavior is so unrealistic that it counteracts all the effort put into the visualization of the small towns and their surroundings. I've added an additional star from my earlier review, since the producers really did apparently try to give us 1952 England; but the production was forced to be so post-modern friendly, that they lost the originality and reality that would have made these episodes much better editions.

Had they considered a series focusing Miss Marple's sophisticated nephew, with new story lines, it might have been fascinating; but trying to hang onto some thin thread of the original plots, while taking all the chracters from 2006 and putting them into period settings, was not a convincing combination.",1151366400,104,2305,4.979220779220779

2603315,3,B000GAKFIG,"Well, Geraldine McEwan is excellent as Miss Jane Marple. The problem with the series is the writing. Apparently, the writers have gone Hollywood. They did not just adapt the works of Dame Agatha Christie. They actually had the hubris to rewrite her works of fiction. In fact, only the first two episodes is season two are based upon works involving the character of Miss Jane Marple. Episode three in season two is based upon a book by Dame Christie that features the characters of Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, which has been rewritten to interject Miss Jane Marple. The fourth episode was based on a straight work of detective fiction by Dame Christie that featured no recurring characters. So, the writers decided that they would  interject Miss Jane Marple as a character.

The first three episodes of season two were tolerable, despite the convoluted machinations of the writers, thanks to the excellent cast. Unfortunately, episode four was downright dreadful. Not even  the excellent cast could save that episode. Moreover, though these episodes were based on works of fiction that were viewed as relatively contemporary when written, they are now period pieces. Even that, the writers chose to change. If it had a nineteen  thirties setting, the writers chose to make it an early nineteen fifties setting. The problem is that no matter what, there is no real authenticity of time and place. To add insult to injury, the writers oftentimes interject the social mores of our time rather than that of the relevant period. Therefore, the period looks and feels fake. In fact, at times,  parts of an episode feel arch and downright campy. In that, the writers succeeded.

I suppose some viewers will really like this series, while purists may loathe it. I fall somewhere in the middle. I will probably view season three, if only to see what more damage these writers can wreak upon the works of a legendary mystery writer. The one thing that is certain is that none of these writers will be remembered years from now, unlike Dame Agatha Christie.",1490486400,3,2049,4.92463768115942

2603387,5,B000GAKFIG,I really like this series. Geraldine McEwan is one of the best Marples ever.,1474848000,,76,4.5
2603388,3,B000GAKFIG,"Geraldine McEwan has always been one of my favorite actresses. On their own, these might be considered wonderful, but unfortunately comparing them to the majestic Joan Hickson Marples is unavoidable, and they are not just weak, but quite weak, in comparison. While the Hickson Marples were charming, graceful, peaceful, and absorbing, this version tries too hard to be new, different, modern, and relevant, and so often takes things in the opposite direction. Formerly charming characters are now crabby and unpleasant. Formerly quiet color palettes are now bright, harsh, and acidic. A formerly graceful and elegant Miss Marple - who was never frumpy and who was just as comfortable having elegant cocktails with the upperclass as she was having tea with the cook - is now decidedly a frump. The Hickson Marples beg repeated viewing with new pleasures and new clues joyfully discovered with each visit (and you are visiting, not just watching). These are fun once, but once is enough. Lastly, if you want to better appreciate the wonderful Geraldine McEwan, she is much better served in the absolutely outstanding ""Mapp and Lucia"" series.",1474243200,,1139,5.195652173913044

2603436,4,B000GAKFIG,"this review refers only to ""The Moving Finger.""  It boasts a fine cast that plays well together.  Joan Hickson is a warmer Miss Marple than Joan Hickson (I prefer the latter, but tastes differ).  The entire ""Marple"" series adds more sex to the stories, and that's seldom an improvement (Agatha Christie knew what she was doing); and the screenwriters thought they had to give the spinster an ancient (and apparently adulterous) romance.  In this episode these are minor distractions.  This one works.",1462406400,,500,5.048780487804878

2603565,3,B000GAKFIG,"I had high hopes for the second series of Miss Marple after the refreshing take on Christie's favorite sleuth from the first series.  While there is admirable acting, the show was starting to show a trend that began to sour my liking for this version of Miss Marple.  If there is anything that irks me it is tampering way too much with a source material that works perfectly well as a book.  ""Sleeping Murder"" has many, many changes.  Besides the awful stage show troupe that was never in the book, Gwenda's fiancee is not the loving figure of the book but a distant, clipped aristocratic voice on the end of a phone while the man who he hires to watch her becomes the ""love interest"".  Beginning with Series 2, the writers were turning to Christie books that had nothing to do with Miss Marple, thus the inclusion of ""By the Pricking of My Thumbs"" and ""The Sittaford Mystery"".  I can just imagine the type of people who read Agatha Christie rushing out to find these books and, half-way through the book scratching their head asking ""Where is Miss Marple?"".  It's admirable to resurrect two of Christie's least appreciated sleuths Tommy and Tuppence, but they worked perfectly well without Miss Marple!  ""The Moving Finger"" is the best adaptation of this bunch.  The pace and feel of ""Moving Finger"" is both calm and bizarre, the usual Christie suspects seem more over the top than ever, but somehow grounded in the sensible Christie tradition of drawing-room murder.
The acting is still respectable and McEwan is no less lovely, but the series has started to shirk it's obligation to be faithful to Christie's text and starts to feel like tampering for the sake of tampering.  It can only get worse...",1400803200,3,1703,4.722972972972973

2603578,5,B000GAKFIG,"Although I really liked the Joan Hickson ""Marple"", Geraldine McEwan (and Julia McKenzie too) is a wonderful actor for the role.  She does bring more life into the role.  Hickson was the contemplative one while McEwan is the ""warmer"" one.  In either case, Marple has an analytical mind and unflinching eye, but McEwan brings a little more humanity into the characterization.
  Perhaps in the long run I would choose either McEwan/McKenzie over Hickson because of this closeness.  But then the hard and unflinching pursuit of evil-doers by Hickson is what a detective must do.  Hmmmm.

The videos do not follow the books completely but that is okay as the basic gist of the stories are there and after all films have poetic license to make the stories fit the screen.",1395705600,,295,4.192982456140351

2603601,2,B000GAKFIG,"I love the actress, but the series is not captioned.  I would assume most of the folks who would want to watch this series are older and the British accent along with a little hearing loss makes it impossible to know most of the dialogue.

My only complaint is not with the content but with Amazon's presentation.  I have a hearing loss and depend upon closed captioning.  Many of Amazon's instant videos do not have closed captioning.  If you need closed captioning, as I do, be alert to which movies are captioned.

Lack of closed captioning does not necessarily mean that the captioning has not been created.  I have seen presentations of more than one movie that sometimes have closed captioning and sometimes do not.

The irrepressible sparkle in her eye let's you know she is a step ahead of any investigator, or those of us trying to untangle the gnarl of suspicious characters.

2603607,5,B000GAKFIG,"I love mysteries and I especially enjoy Agatha Christie mysteries.  Jane Marple is my favorite Christie character. I suppose it is because I enjoy such an unassuming older woman noticing things that the hot shots detectives do not see or at least notice.  Christie developed Marple as a complete character with lots of friends and hobbies. Geraldine McEwan captured the very essence of Marple and made her approachable, tactful, friendly, humble and very very smart.",1393372800,2,466,5.2

2603616,3,B000GAKFIG,Enjoyable in terms of costume and setting. The actors are wonderful. Miss Marple is well played but not the Miss Marple I imagine from the books--she is too perky. But overall pleasant and I'm hooked.,1392854400,,200,4.742857142857143

2603627,4,B000GAKFIG,"I think that Geraldine McEwan does an excellent job as the title character. She can appear frail as an elderly woman from a small village who at times seems confused, all the while noticing the small details and character traits that inevitably give the murderer away. The supporting casts have also been top notch. I've enjoyed the episodes very much, and I think if you are an Agatha Christie fan, you will too.",1391126400,,413,4.671232876712328

2603629,5,B000GAKFIG,"McEwan is terrific. The casts are great. Well-written. Well-staged. Authentic swing-era music and I play it so I know. Like Christie's books, once started, these are hard to put down.

I could go on and on, but you should see the first one. You won't stop there.

Added comment: You need a good sound system and a quiet room to follow the dialogue, and there are a lot of characters to keep track of. These shows require the viewer's full attention.

I read some other reviews. Surprised some of them are so negative. I enjoyed the Charlie Chan (20th Century Fox) movies, Rathbone's Sherlock, Suchet's Poirot, and the Elementary CBS series. This series (so far) compares well.",1390348800,,676,4.760683760683761

2603637,5,B000GAKFIG,"The idyllic life of the small country village of Lymestock is disrupted by a spate of poison pen letters and the mysterious suicide of a friend of Miss Marple which may be connected. Enter two outsiders from London, Jerry and Joanna Burton, siblings, who take up temporary residency while Jerry convalescences from a motorcycle accident. James D'Arcy and Emilia Fox are wonderful as Jerry and Joanna Burton. The strikingly handsome D'Arcy portrays a young war veteran trying to find his way in post-war life. As his caring sister, Fox is a memorable contrast with an engaging manner, shocking red hair and colorful city wardrobe. The quirky cast also  includes Frances de la Tour (Harry Potter) as the vicar's wife,  Ken Russell  (The Devils, Women in Love) as the vicar, Sean Pertwee (Cadfael) as the local doctor, Harry Enfield, the solicitor & Imogen Stubbs, as his gossip-loving wife. Kelly Brook is the voluptuous governess Elsie Holland and Talulah Riley is the awkward ugly duckling stepdaughter, Megan Hunter. Lots of gentle wit and subtle innuendo. Of course Miss Marple discovers the the perpetrator of the letters and murders and Lymestock is restored to its idyllic state. This is not a typical Marple as one of the characters, Jerry Burton, is also the narrator and there are romantic subplots.",1389225600,,1307,5.041666666666667
2603638,5,B000GAKFIG,"We have been watching the newer Miss Marples and comparing them to the Joan Hickson productions.
It's very interesting. The old ones have a more authentic 1950s feel about them, and we believe they stick more

2603641,5,B000GAKFIG,Geraldine McEwan is a brilliant actress. She places that wig on her head and becomes Miss Marple. The lovely and sweet spinster who is the smartest person in the woman and blends completely in the background. These stories were updated for modern audiences. People may have issues with the touches of modernity. I loved this particular episode.,1388102400,2,344,5.052631578947368
2603642,4,B000GAKFIG,I am enjoying all of these Christie episodes. This particular one with the US airman is a disappointment only in the use of the uniform. It is obvious that the uniforms are British attempts at US uniforms. The hat is pulled too far down. The ribbon worn is not US. There is no rank insignia. Still it was entertaining.,1388102400,,318,4.406779661016949
2603643,3,B000GAKFIG,I watch it sometimes but she is not as good to me as I used to think she was.  Too much meanness is expressed in her books.,1386979200,,123,3.5555555555555554
2603644,5,B000GAKFIG,This is another good series of Marple.  You are trying to figure out who killed who and most of the times do not figure out till nearly the end of the movie.  A good series for the entire family. The words used is ok for the little ones too.,1386201600,,241,3.8979591836734695

2603647,5,B000GAKFIG,"Liberties have been taken with these famous stories, but according to the bonus material, they had permission from the estate of Agatha Christie to do what they saw fit with her work.  Which was exceedingly gracious of them to hand over a dead author's work for wholesale tampering.  Still.  I love Geraldine McEwan so I'm willing to overlook the many story changes.
These movies are entertaining.  I thoroughly enjoyed them.  Yes, it would have been nice/respectful if they hadn't made so many alterations but there it is, I'm willing to put up with a lot as long as they don't ruin everything that makes the character so lovable.",1385683200,,631,4.805555555555555

2603673,1,B000GAKFIG,"The Sittaford Mystery is as bad as it gets as a production based on Agatha Christie's novel. There is no saving grace: The murderer is changed. The ultimate love interest of Emily is changed; her boyfriend is portrayed as a hopeless alcoholic and worthy only of being ditched. The focus of the action is changed, e.g, the Epytian/archeology business is a distortion of a mere textual reference; the role of Emily as the problem solver is mainly given over to an off-the-wall introduction of Miss Marple, who upstages Emily and the reporter as a more grown up version of Tommy and Tupence; much of the incidental detail is changed. The cast is good. The script is an outrage.",1379116800,3,674,4.720338983050848
2603674,4,B000GAKFIG,"Well done, good watching.
The only negatives are that  the English accent is hard to understand at points and they tend to rush through scenes with important plot details. Overall, I enjoy watching the shows.",1379116800,,208,4.942857142857143

2603678,5,B000GAKFIG,What more can I say?...Agatha Christie and Geraldine McEwan can't be beat. Ms. McEwen is by far the best fit for Agatha Christies Miss Marples character. Cozy to watch on a gray winter day.,1378771200,2,189,4.588235294117647
2603679,5,B000GAKFIG,Love Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. One really feels like they are visiting a cozy English Village. Always enjoyed the books and love the video portrayals.,1378425600,,155,5.24

2603682,5,B000GAKFIG,I like almost everything Agatha Christie wrote.  The acting is excellent. Geraldine McEwan is delightful. Her characterization of Jane Marple is intriguing. It was a bit of a surprise to find she has a history that was never hinted at in the movies with Joan Hickson. I recommend these movies without reservation.,1377820800,2,313,5.019230769230769

2603685,4,B000GAKFIG,"We have enjoyed this version of Miss Marple's adventures. They are fast-paced and they throw out a bunch of info at one time, but are still enjoyable. The actors are all superb.",1377216000,,177,4.5625
2603686,5,B000GAKFIG,"I would compare it to Hercule Poirot, or Midsomer Murder. I really like the acting by Geraldine McEwan, she is really good as Miss Marple.",1377129600,,138,4.56
2603687,5,B000GAKFIG,"5 stars because it is simply the best written mystery without all the blood and gore of today's stories. You get to see all the clues and quietly decide "" who done it "" and then watch Miss Marple solve the case. Just delightful",1377043200,,227,4.181818181818182
2603688,5,B000GAKFIG,I enjoyed every episode. Lots of surprises twist and turns. Lovely backgrounds and county you feel like it was filmed in that time period. Well worth the watch.,1376956800,,160,4.75
2603689,5,B000GAKFIG,"While the series doesn't always stick exactly to the book it is always exciting to watch! Geraldine McEwan IS Jane Marple to a certainty. The dress, manners and language are true to the period right down to the furniture and housing. There is a plethora of styles as well from the Art Deco of the 30's to Georgian, Edwardian and Victorian manors.

One of the difficulties Americans might find besides the Britishisms, which aren't all that hard to figure out, is the list of guest stars. Unless you watch a lot of British telly you probably won't recognize any of the names or very few. That made the one I really recognized stand out.

2603690,5,B000GAKFIG,"Miss Marple comes in second in my love of Agatha Christie characters.  I love watching the movies & in my opinion Geraldine McEwan plays a better Miss Marple.
She has that ""grandmother"" quality about her that makes you believe she is Marple.",1376438400,2,241,4.738095238095238

2603692,5,B000GAKFIG,We love the Miss Marple series and like to go back and see them all over again.  It is so true to the English countryside lifestyle and we like the way she uses wit and intelligence together in the series.  Great writing and great acting.,1375574400,,238,4.266666666666667
2603693,2,B000GAKFIG,"I've read some of the books and seen other versions, like Joan Hickson (which are very good) and they made sense, some of these I didn't even recognize until the very end, and then I was like, that was nothing like the other versions, or the story.",1375488000,,248,4.297872340425532
2603694,5,B000GAKFIG,"Having read the books upon which this series is based, I believe they have done an excellent job of translating from words to video.  The Marple character I'd different in the video but is credible.  The acting and settings are all well done.  You will probably enjoy this series if you like mystery stories.",1375056000,,308,4.666666666666667
2603695,5,B000GAKFIG,"Geraldine McEwan was the best Miss Marple so I thoroughly enjoyed watching every one of her shows.  They are goo, interesting, fun and clever.",1374883200,,142,4.916666666666667
2603696,1,B000GAKFIG,"Perhaps Joan Hickson killed this role for everyone else; perhaps. But even Ms. Hickson could not have made the bad CG good, or the other actors better. Very sad.",1374883200,3,161,4.586206896551724
2603697,5,B000GAKFIG,"I greatly prefer this delightful series to any and all Miss Marple movies I have seen. It has wonderful pacing and delightful characters - the actresses who play the iconic role are each brilliant in their own right (although I do have a favorite, but I'm not telling which...) This series is a must for mystery lovers and Anglophobes alike!",1374710400,,341,4.7

2603699,5,B000GAKFIG,Miss Marple is a very good detective. And even the police ask her advice on matters concerning crimes. She should have been a police officer because she was very good in solving mysterious crimes. And she did it when no one knew she was observing the details.,1374624000,,259,4.531914893617022
2603700,5,B000GAKFIG,A very good series. I enjoyed these mysteries. Geraldine McEwan made a very good Miss Marple. I wish she had more of these shows.,1374624000,,129,4.416666666666667
2603701,5,B000GAKFIG,A highly watchable series showcasing Geraldine McEwan as the curious Jane Marple. Great episodes worthy of repeat viewings. Wish we could see all of this series. Highly recommend!,1373932800,,179,5.428571428571429
2603702,5,B000GAKFIG,Great mystery series. Very well done and accurate to the book they are based on. I could watch the episodes over and over again!,1373760000,,128,4.375
2603703,5,B000GAKFIG,What a wonderful series! The acting was superb. The filming was beautifully done. I loved it! Do not miss it!,1373760000,,109,4.5
2603704,5,B000GAKFIG,I think Geraldine McEwan is one of the best at playing Marple. I know there are several actress that have filled this role but Mrs. McEwan is one of my favorites.,1373500800,,162,4.258064516129032
2603705,5,B000GAKFIG,This is the greatest detective.  You can see her stop and think through the items put forth.  She does not jump to conclusions and does not embarrass the detectives on the scene.  It is no wonder she keeps getting remade for the masses to watch.,1373328000,,245,4.4
2603706,5,B000GAKFIG,really a fan of Agatha Christie.  Ms McEwan is a superb actress (just my opinion) and she brings a different life to a great character.,1373155200,,135,4.4
2603707,4,B000GAKFIG,"These are very well produced Christie stories and while I enjoyed them, I still prefer the Joan Hickson series.  There are some liberties taken with Christie's original stories but not so much that enjoyment is affected.  All that being said I would certainly recommend this series.",1372982400,,282,5.108695652173913
2603708,5,B000GAKFIG,"All Christie is good Christie -- sort of.  Agatha herself would not have appreciated the appropriation of HER Miss Marple, but fans will still love these versions of Tea and Scandal at the Vicarage, in the Library, in Chipping Clegghorn, and on tour of stately homes and gardens.  Colorful and with sparkling dialogue, these versions may add a twist, condense events and possibly even tell a little more about a character's sexuality than matters to the story.  Still every episode sparkles.  Be sure to enjoy Emilia Fox conquering a poison pen in ""Moving Finger.""",1372982400,,564,4.968085106382978
2603709,3,B000GAKFIG,"I have watched  all of the Joan Hickson Miss Marples.  I think they are much better.  I have read all of the Agatha Christie books,and think Hickson comes closer to the Miss Marple I envisioned while I was reading.",1372809600,,214,4.435897435897436
2603710,3,B000GAKFIG,Some of the styles of directing are not as watchable as others. These stories have been told in so many different ways that it is hard to have a new way of presenting them. Some of the episodes tried to much cinematic styling rather than allowing classic stories with good acting to shine through.,1372550400,,297,4.518518518518518

2603714,5,B000GAKFIG,Agatha Christie sure has fun with Annie Marple!  She also has very interesting friends!  The period piece gives an interesting view of England.  Character development is excellent!.,1371427200,,181,5.62962962962963
2603715,5,B000GAKFIG,"I didn't think I would enjoy this program so much but it is very much fun to watch.  I am already on the 3rd season!  Programs like this are a refreshing change from the current lack of choices on TV if you just want to be entertained with a good mystery and skip the blood, gore and car crashes.",1371081600,,296,4.0
2603716,4,B000GAKFIG,"Love the character Marple, and this series shows the charm of English rural life. The repetitive theme of inept detectives is a tad predictable. We also find the dialogue hard to understand. Like any on going show one is bound to find some better than others. For those of us that love a mystery with all the right embellishments Marple delivers.",1371081600,,346,4.688524590163935
2603717,5,B000GAKFIG,"McEwen is a fabulous Miss Marple---just the right blend of insatiable curiosity, lovely manners,old fashioned notions, and sprightly energy.
I could quibble about changes in the way stories/novels are scripted, but that's just inevitable---what works on the page isn't always viable on the stage (screen).
Lastly, what a great collection of actors in the series---some I haven't seen for years but remember in other series or favorite movies.
Full marks!",1370908800,,454,5.5
2603718,5,B000GAKFIG,Still a joy... McEwan's second stint as Marple was wonderful.  And unlike Jessica Fletcher - she's not waiting around in her home town for murder to find her!,1369872000,,158,4.642857142857143

2603720,4,B000GAKFIG,"This portrayal of Miss Marple is pretty good.  She's a sharp lady and doesn't miss a trick.  However, no one can ever match Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple, she was genius.",1369440000,,175,4.612903225806452

2603724,5,B000GAKFIG,"I love this series, love the characters.  It's also fun to see familiar British actors from other British movies I see (we watch lots of Jane Austen movies and Harry Potter).  I love the mystery and solving the crimes, and I LOVE when Miss Marple acts like a generic little old lady but then dazzles the inspectors with her brilliance and inquisitive questioning.  You can see the looks on the inspectors going from dismissive to appreciative of this lady's offer to help.",1367625600,,472,4.7317073170731705
2603725,5,B000GAKFIG,I think the fascination with this character is that there are always a ton of culprits but only 1 or 2 guilty ones. Int his series Jane Marple reflects back on one of her own love indiscretions - kind of makes her more human. And Geraldine McEwan adds another dimension to Miss Marple that Margret Rutherford carried off with humor.,1367452800,,332,4.55
2603726,5,B000GAKFIG,"This is my family's favorite show.  We watched this on TV when it originally aired on PBS and then, all of a sudden, it disappeared!  Besides the original Miss Marple, Margaret Rutherford, this is by far the best version.  Although I love all the British sleuthing shows, Poirot, other Agatha Christie adaptations, Rosemary and Thyme, etc...this is the one I will watch over and over.  It's definitely our go-to show.  If none of us can decide what sounds good, it's always Miss Marple.  I find the plots interested and the acting to be excellent.  I love the setting of this St. Mary Meade.  I have read a few of Agatha's books but not enough to say whether these stay true to the story and mood of her writings but I know if you're looking for an interesting and mostly ""clean"" mystery, you cannot go wrong with this adaptation of Miss Marple.",1367452800,4,845,4.549668874172186
2603727,4,B000GAKFIG,"Enjoyable. Always entertaining.  I would like to see more shows like these.  I do not like R rated and foul language in shows I watch.  I also do not like paying for something twice, so if a show requires me to pay in addition to my yearly prime account I will not purchase it.  I can usually find it for no,additional charge on Netflix or other venues.  At the end of the year I will consider whether I will renew the Amazon Prime just for this reason.",1367107200,,453,4.160919540229885
2603728,2,B000GAKFIG,"I have watched a couple of different Miss Marples and this one is just not the one for me. The lead character comes off being way too dotty and silly to be Miss Marple. Joan Hickson in the role brings a gravity to the role that Geraldine McEwan doesn't. I wanted to like it, I really did, but I couldn't even get through a complete episode. Go to the Miss Marple collection in Amazon and try the Joan Hickson collection--you'll never go back!",1367107200,,442,4.337349397590361

2603758,2,B000GAKFIG,"As an Agatha Christie fan, I appreciate the iconic Joan Hickson adaptations as being enjoyable and faithful to the original.  But I also realize they're a bit of a slow burn and can understand wanting to update them.

This adaptation tries - it tries to update the stories and make them snappy and entertaining for a modern audience.  And it fails terribly.  Pretend (to pick an example) you've never read ""Sleeping Murder"".  Pretend you've never heard of Miss Marple.  Pretend you're just a fan of period British mysteries.  ""Sleeping Murder"" then becomes an incredibly confusing, sordid, historically inaccurate mess with a murder wedged awkwardly into the middle and a random old lady that appears out of nowhere and tears about for no apparent reason. The story just doesn't make any sense and one feels as if they just kept adding more characters and subplots in a desperate effort to keep  stoking the engine until it could crash into its completely random and unsatisfying ending.  Fundamentally, it lacks a decent murder mystery at its heart and no amount of incest, kleptomaniac cat burglars, outrageous vaudevillians, mysterious Indians, or shocking subplots can disguise it.  The fact that they had to resort to such devices is proof that the basic mystery - the heart if a classic British cozy - is sadly lacking.

Now, add classic Miss Marple back in.  She makes absolutely no sense in this ""new"" story - it's far too vulgar and completely lacks the subtle underpinnings she needs to function properly.  So, change her into this completely different Miss Marple.  She doesn't make any sense, either - there's no reason for her to be there.

Going back to the original novel, it's a story where a significant portion of the story concerns a young lady, a house, and an increasingly creepy sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.  When Miss Marple finally appears, the story becomes classic Christie: a slow unravelling; the perils of digging into the past; and the sudden twist when you realize everything you've learned is both true and horribly misleading.  Miss Marple's creepy warnings about digging into the past help set the tone, while she herself acts as observer and facilitator, helping both the protagonist and the audience along in this slow unravelling, as she's tidily knitting all those loose ends into a coherent solution.  Since all this movie has in common is the basic premise of the d&eacute;j&agrave; vu house and the identity of the culprit, Miss Marple is no longer needed.  And since it no longer has any of the  suspense or twists (just a procession of increasingly outrageous reveals that completely fail to tie back in to the story) their new Miss Marple seems superfluous.

I understand they wanted a ""new"" ending, but I'd rather see someone try and do justice to the psychological suspense inherent to the original.  If you want mysterious Indians, use Wilkie Collins.  If you want a flashy thieves, how about Arsene Lupin?  But vaudevillian performers with infertility problems?  Even I can't help you with that; make a new story that can stand on its own.  Just don't call it a ""mystery"".  And leave poor Miss Marple out of it.",1360022400,,3162,4.928166351606805
2603759,4,B000GAKFIG,"We recently viewed actress Geraldine McEwan's twelve Ms. Marple films (Series 1-3), and, for us, Series 2 (""Sleeping Murder,"" ""By the Pricking of My Thumbs,"" ""The Moving Finger,"" and ""The Sittaford Mystery"") proved the most consistently entertaining of the three sets.  The now-retired Ms. McEwan imbues her elderly British detective from St. Mary Mead with such a wonderfully wispy, almost bohemian charm (just look at her hats!) that she provides a much-needed makeover for the character to thrive in the 21st Century.  Although there have been numerous interpretations of Ms. Marple (i.e. Margaret Rutherford, Angela Lansbury, Joan Hickson and McEwan's stout successor, Julia McKenzie), I would consider McEwan's fun take the most delightful in terms of watching these films freely adapt classic mysteries utilizing flashy camera techniques and some spicy plot twists to appeal to contemporary audiences.  With that in mind, this review isn't going to compare the films to Agatha Christie's books per se, but rather it is about Series 2's overall content (with minimal spoilers).

First, the terrific ""Sleeping Murder"" is a clever reworking of Christie's last published Marple novel.  Our intrepid sleuth comes to the aid of newly engaged Gwenda (Sophia Myles), who is suddenly haunted by long-repressed memories now coming to the surface from a homicide she witnessed as a toddler in the very same house she has just purchased.  Critical to the plot is her late father's link to a local theatrical troupe years before, all of whom may be possible culprits linked to the murder Gwenda witnessed.  In a significant difference from the book, co-sleuthing with Gwenda is her fiance's nebbish employee, Hugh (Aidan McArdle).  The only real disappointment is that the audience is cheated out of a close-up in Gwenda and Hugh's last scene; the result remains obvious enough, but it is still disappointing to watch the film's closing seconds from afar.  Rating: 8.5/10.

""By the Pricking of My Thumbs,"" as you may know, inserts Ms. Marple into a Tommy & Tuppence mystery.  In this surprising faithful adaptation, the Beresfords are still middle-aged, with Tommy (Anthony Andrews) working as a British Secret Service agent while his neglected wife Tuppence (Greta Scacchi) copes with empty nest syndrome.  By chance, Ms. Marple and Tuppence team up to solve not only the suspicious death of Tommy's elderly aunt, but also the disappearance of her acquaintance from a seemingly ordinary retirement home.  Their primary clue is an inherited painting of a quaint little cottage that may possess the ominous answers they seek.  Many Christie fans won't appreciate the portrayal of Tuppence's alcoholism; still, this underlying sub-plot ties into the ultimate fate of the strained Beresford marriage at the story's end.  This film would have made an excellent back-door pilot for a separate Tommy & Tuppence ongoing series.  Side note: future ""Bionic Woman"" Michelle Ryan has a small role here as a village girl.  Rating: 8.5/10.

Next up is ""The Moving Finger,"" which involves protagonist Jerry Burton and his saucy sister's move to a village plagued by a vicious series of poison pen letters leading to suicide and murder.  Complicating Jerry's life is his recovery from alcoholism and a pair of broken legs from a motorcycle accident in a failed suicide attempt.  The death of an old friend soon draws Ms. Marple into town setting into motion a plot with several possible suspects.  With Ms. Marple's encouragement, Jerry slowly puts the pieces together without really playing detective.  Although this premise isn't necessarily the greatest, the film itself proves worthy of spending ninety minutes with these characters.  On a side note, a distracting flaw is the glossy bookend scenes of Jerry riding a motorcycle; both scenes were so obviously filmed on blue screen that their laughable phoniness diminishes the set up and conclusion of the hero's psychological dilemma.  Rating: 8/10.

Lastly, we have ""The Sittaford Mystery"" starring Timothy Dalton as an ill-fated candidate for British Prime Minister following a seance at a snowed-in hotel in a remote village.  Although the set-up is a cliche and the closing image doesn't really make any sense, the film itself is still solidly entertaining, as Ms. Marple has the least amount of screen time of the characters.  Once again, she is the consultant for a pair of amateur detectives with a hint of romance in the air.  Our favorite scene comes late here when an obnoxiously hung-over prime suspect (actor Laurence Fox, the future sidekick in ""The Inspector Lewis Mysteries""), already under house arrest, wakes up next to a male corpse and bewilderedly declares, ""I didn't do it!""  It is a morbidly comic gem!  Rating: 7.5/10.

If you are not familiar with Geraldine McEwan as a fairy-like Ms. Marple, I highly recommend Series 2 as a starting point.  Still, as a fair warning, there are some disturbing adult themes scattered throughout these movies, so they should be considered rated at least PG-13.  Unlike the shockingly tasteless ""Body in the Library"" from Series 1, these four mysteries are practically tame in comparison and sharply edited for a leisurely pace while disguising the rapid-fire clues.  Top-tier entertainment!

Still, these are good mysteries, and Geraldine brings a younger, fresher perception of Miss Marple to the character. Given the cost of the individual episodes, I recommend viewing them through Prime or NetFlix - but if you are looking to watch a fun series, I recommend these.

2603763,1,B000GAKFIG,"Unfortunately these rewrites of Christie classics are anything but ""true to the spirit"" of Agatha Christie.  She must be spinning in her grave with indignation over these travesties.

Characters are dropped, others are made up and inserted for little or no reason.  Teenage characters (13 and 16 years old, main characters in different stories) are portrayed as being older than the same character in the novels and far more sophisticated (if you equate a certain type of sexuality with ""sophistication"").

All the older characters drop a full generation, so that middle-aged characters are now twenty-somethings and elderly characters are now merely middle aged.  EVERYBODY is far better looking than in real life OR the novels.  Culprits are changed and the sexuality of main characters is modified.  ""Romantic"" themes that were not present in the original stories, usually involving main characters that were invented solely for these TV episodes, are inserted for little or no reason, and add not a thing to the main story line.

As for Geraldine McEwan being the ultimate Marple, sorry, but she's not.  This ""Marple"" bears little resemblance to the Jane Marple of the books.  There is nowhere near enough of the wry humor of the original, nor of the air of genteel poverty that Miss Marple lives in, as is clear throughout the original Christie tales.  She has an ""income"" but it is not sufficient to keep her in true comfort; hence she trains young girls who want to ""go into service"" for that little bit of extra income and/or in exchange for their services while they are in training, and in her declining years she is largely supported by her nephew.

In particular, Miss Marple wouldn't have been caught dead dressing like a dowdy charwoman, which is what the wardrobe choices for her in these episodes make her look like.

Main characters are relegated to becoming bit parts, disappear altogether, or are warped into totally unrecognizable caricatures of stereotypical types that bear absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the originals; in one case, the original character of a bumbling country priest is transmogrified into a snarling raving Nazi.  The character isn't the only thing about that story that's insane; whoever mangled these stories for the sake of ""modernizing"" the scripts ought to be stood up against a wall somewhere and summarily shot.

These stories have not been improved by any stretch of the imagination.  Instead, they've been mangled into near unrecognizability, with Christie's witty, gentle, loving character studies being replaced by prurient sensationalist ""plots"" that are about as subtle as the blunt object the murder victim gets clubbed with.

Don't confuse these travesties with the fine productions staring Joan Hickson.  She didn't quite capture all of Miss Marple's character - she's just a tad bit too severe - but she at least rang true to the era and the character, even if incompletely.  She just didn't have the ""birdlike"" quality Miss Marple of the novels has, but she hit almost every other Marple note dead on.  The wry wit, the gentle but inexorable sharpness of her intellect, her masterful and largely non-judgmental grasp of the vagaries of human existence; Joan Hickson got those all dead on.  Of course she was undoubtedly helped no end in her portrayal by being given scripts that are as true to the original novels as possible. Miss Marple fits into that world as created by Christie for her.  Change that, and the Miss Marple you get is something wholly different and entirely (in these cases) unsatisfactory.",1349913600,7,3577,5.068259385665529
2603764,5,B000GAKFIG,"With the death of Joan Hickson, the perfect Miss Marple (and veteran of several of the Carry-On films), and with the likes of the redoubtable Helen Hayes having done her bit as well, the producers of the Miss Marple Series, had a very real problem: how do you retain the freshness in stories that have been read by tens of millions and watched by at least the same number of people. i think they made a wise decision, retain the fundamental plots of the Miss Marple books, but work on the externals and time period involved to produce a different atmosphere than the earlier TV and film shows, so as to give the watcher a different ""feel"" than was previously experienced. Beyond that, they inserted Miss Marple into books which in which she had not appeared. Admittedly, the first time I saw this new Miss Marple, the strength of the Hickson production bedeviled my appreciation of the efforts of the creative staff and the expert performance of Geraldine McEwan, as Miss Marple. This time,though, I could enjoy the new Miss Marple and the work of the expert staff, to a considerably greater degree; similarly, the variation in casting of featured players and reworking of their interaction with a changed Miss Marple were sufficiently different to renew the vitality of the plot for me.
In sum, to those who are unfamiliar with the television rendering by Helen Hayes, the broad comedy of Margaret Rutherford or the verisimilitude of Joan Hickson, I strongly recommend a look-in for some real pleasure. More experienced viewers take a greater risk of expectations being frustrated because of the differences introduced as compared to earlier versions, If obtained at a reasonable price, I think that risk will be minimized for many.",1345939200,2,1733,4.8979591836734695

2603766,4,B000GAKFIG,"The second set of stories from the new MARPLE, starring Geraldine McEwan as Agatha Christie's immortal sleuth, Jane Marple.  Whilst many have been quite vocal in criticising these new versions (mainly for playing around with the original stories and slotting Marple into plots she never originally appeared in), the main strength comes from McEwan's central performance.  She's not in the classic Joan Hickson mold (this is to her credit), for while Hickson was often quite starchy and strait-laced, McEwan's Marple is delightfully bohemian in her over-sized cardigans and crumpled hats, and will remind you, perhaps, of the slightly dotty old maiden aunt you loved visiting in your childhood.  McEwan's Marple conceals her razor-sharp detection skills and intellect underneath a veil of vagueness.  Many a murderer will underestimate her at their peril.

Incredibly, the best story in this set is actually an adventure in which Marple never figured originally - ""By the Pricking of My Thumbs"" - one of the rollicking Tommy & Tuppence Beresford mysteries, in which Jane has been cleverly inserted (what I wouldn't give to see a full ""Tommy & Tuppence"" series with Anthony Andrews and Greta Scacchi!).  The other main standout is ""The Moving Finger"", which stars Emilia Fox in a va-va-voom red wig, and features a particularly-plush production & costume design.  Things get clunky, however, in ""Sleeping Murder"", which is hindered by its grating and somewhat overbearing heroine.

Includes:

BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMBS - Following the sudden death of Tommy's Aunt Ada (Claire Bloom)  at her nursing home, Jane joins forces with Tuppence Beresford to untangle the connection between the disappearance of a fellow nursing home resident and a strange picture entitled ""The Witches' House"", discovered amongst Ada's personal effects.  Featuring special guest stars Anthony Andrews and Greta Scacchi as Tommy and Tuppence Beresford.

Guest stars: Miriam Karlin, Steven Berkoff, Bonnie Langford, Josie Lawrence, June Whitfield, Michael Maloney, Brian Conley, Charles Dance, Lia Williams, Patrick Barlow and Clare Holman.

THE MOVING FINGER - After almost being killed in a self-inflicted motorcycle crash, Joanna Burton (Emilia Fox) takes her brother Jerry (James D'Arcy) to the quiet village of Lymstock for some much-needed rest and recuperation; however their peace is short-lived when the pair discover the village to be in the grip of a poison-pen writer.

Guest stars: Frances de la Tour, Ken Russell, Thelma Barlow, Sean Pertwee, Imogen Stubbs, Harry Enfield, Kelly Brook, Rosalind Knight, Jessica Hynes, Talulah Riley and John Sessions.

SLEEPING MURDER - Gwenda Halliday (Sophia Myles) arrives in England to choose the dream house to go with her new fianc, but the house also awakens bizarre memories which hark back to Gwenda's childhood and a murder she couldn't possibly have born witness to because, up until now, Gwenda has only ever lived in India...

Guest stars: Dawn French, Geraldine Chaplin, Julian Wadham, Paul McGann, Martin Kemp, Una Stubbs, Russ Abbot, Sarah Paris, Anna-Louise Plowman and Harriet Walter.

THE SITTAFORD MYSTERY - At a snow-bound Inn, several guests decide to while away the evening by messing around with a Ouija board, where it's predicted that one of the guests, world adventurer, philanthropist and political heir-apparent to Churchill, Clive Trevelyan (Timothy Dalton), will be killed.  Sure enough, the dead body of Trevelyan is discovered the following morning.  His personal secretary John Enderby (Mel Smith), assisted by Jane and socialite Emily Trefusis (Zoe Telford), the girlfriend of the chief suspect, takes up the line of enquiry.

Guest stars: Carey Mulligan, Patricia Hodge, James Murray, Laurence Fox, Rita Tushingham, James Wilby, Paul Kaye, Robert Hardy, Jeffery Kissoon and Michael Brandon.",1340150400,3,3848,5.446127946127946

I've enjoyed both other ladies, but McEwan brings a life and sparkle to the role that the others seem to miss.  She just seems more inquisitive!  The beef I have with this series is the incorporating of the Tommy and Tuppence story ""By the Pricking of My Thumbs"" into a Miss Marple mystery. I probably wouldn't have minded if they just borrowed the story, but to turn Tommy and Tuppence into an insensitive bureaucrat and an insecure lush is sacrilege. Tuppence is an intuitive adventurer and Tommy, her sweet and sensible rock.  Leave their characters alone!  Let Miss Marple solve the case by herself.

2603781,3,B000GAKFIG,"Miss Marple does not appear in the source books for two of these stories, ""The Sittaford Mystery"" and ""By the Pricking of My Thumbs.""

That said, how do they stack up?

""The Moving Finger"" is the best of the lot.  I'm not such a stickler for Christie that I demand absolute fidelity to the stories.  The original lead character was a smashed up RAF pilot, so he could be thought of as selfless.  However, the character arc of this version is quite good.  The cast is uniformly good and Kelly Brook photographs extremely well.

""Sleeping Murder"" is the last published Marple story and I've often wondered why. Dame Agatha wrote it in the 1940s and planned for it to be published after her death.  It's a good, creepy story, but nothing special (like the similarly held back CURTAIN).  Still, Marple was meant to be in it, and that's just as well.  It's interesting to compare this version to the Joan Hickson version.

""The Sittaford Mystery"" does not originally contain Marple, but it shows how a story can be twisted for the good.  It has a solid, game cast (led by James Bond himself, Timothy Dalton, though his part is all too brief).  And it has a neat ending.

""By the Pricking of My Thumbs"" is barely watchable.  While it might not be a bad story under other circumstances, it's difficult to see Tommy and Tuppence, the joyous young people, played so beautifully thirty years ago by Francesca Annis and James Warwick, become so miserable.  These two minor stars in the Christie firmament deserved more respect.  It should have been a one-off with Scacci and Andrews (who appears all too infrequently) unraveling the mystery.  But someone wanted to capitalize on the Marple imprimatur.  Terrible.

So, three entertaining stories, and one that should never have been made.  It's too bad these lesser-known Christie works can't see the light of day without having unnecessary characters like Marple shoe-horned in for name value.

Otherwise, I think McEwan edges out Joan Hickson (who is no slouch) as Marple.  Hickson's Marples do have better fidelity to their sources, and they are the Marples to have for hard Christie fans.  McEwan's Marple is good, it's too bad that this time Marple got her nose into at least one case where it really, truly did not belong.",1302134400,,2266,4.766066838046273

2603783,5,B000GAKFIG,"I am not a big Agatha Christie fan.  Her output was fine for her time but I prefer the more intricate stories of such authors as Val McDermid and Elizabeth George.  However, this series had one huge thing going for it and that is that Geraldine McEwan plays Marple.  I absolutely adored her in the Mapp and Lucia tv series, where she played Lucia to perfection, and was delighted to discover her as a much older actress in this series, playing Marple.  So fact number one is that if you are a big McEwan fan, this is the series for you.

Next, the attention to detail in these stories is incredible.  If you are going to do period pieces and ALL Christie's work is now a period piece, then the details of that time period will be a considerable part of the charm.  There is nothing more aggravating than seeing a character of the 1930s, 1940s or 1950s wearing the wrong hairstyle, clothes or makeup.  It just ruins the mood.  Ditto if the interior decor, cars and so forth are wrong.  They get all of these details right in this series and I really enjoyed seeing all of these period accessories.  Since Christie's mysteries are all set in drawing rooms and breakfast parlors and gardens and such, it is critical to the overall experience.

The stories themselves are quite good and the cast what we've come to expect from the UK.  I picked out the murderer in one episode simply because I've seen him do such other masterful UK murder roles that I figured the producers would have never hired him if he wasn't to be the murderer!

McEwan is what pushes this up to 5 stars for me.  I would otherwise be tempted to grade it a 4 but she is such a masterful actress that I can't downgrade her series.

Christie's prolific collection of stories should make additional collections possible and I can't think of a better contemporary actress to play Miss Marple than Geraldine McEwan.",1235433600,3,625,5.402061855670103

2603796,5,B000GAKFIG,"I have been a masterpiece / mystery theater fan for years, and find the Miss Marple series with Geraldine McEwan to be top notch.  Excellent actors, sumptious costumes, and beautiful settings make for  extremely entertaining viewing.  Geraldine McEwan is marvelous, and is much better than Joan Hicks ever was!  A perfectly lovely voice accompanies the very intelligent eyes!",1210550400,4,375,5.413793103448276
2603797,5,B000GAKFIG,"There are some negative reviews for this series but I definitely enjoyed it. Geraldine McEwan is adorable, reminding me of Helen Hayes. The stories have been adapted but the production values are excellent. There are name stars such as Timothy Dalton, Anthony Andrews, James D'Arcy and even Ken Russell! I like McEwan's interpretation of Marple and who could resist that tinkle in her eyes.",1200009600,9,390,5.109375
2603798,5,B000GAKFIG,"These new Miss Marples are great.  This set is just as good as the first series, in particular ""Sleeping Murder,"" which was my favorite of the lot.  Stylish, fun mysteries which manage to be involving and entertaining at the same time.  I would highly recommend this set, as well as the rest of the series.",1199404800,6,306,4.527272727272727
2603799,4,B000GAKFIG,"For mystery fans and those who like England, these DVDs are great. My only qualm is that ( in common with the BBC remake of Pride and Prejudice) the background music is TOO LOUD!!!!! and it obscures the dialogue of the actors. Very annoying",1198368000,,240,4.4772727272727275
2603800,1,B000GAKFIG,"In my 20s I read all of the Agatha Christie ""Miss Marple"" books, and found them really fun.  However, the Margaret Rutherford series was entertaining because that actress was so much fun, but the character wasn't remotely like Christie's character, and they threw Christie's plots out the window.  Plus the jokey musical score (which is true of a lot of British comedies from the 50s through 70s) was enough to make you hide under a chair.  (Though I suppose turning the sound off would be more effective.)  And though I love Angela Lansbury, her one Miss Marple movie (""The Mirror Cracked"") was not so good.  And once again Christie's plots were ""improved"" by the screenwriters... but not in a way that was satisfying.

Then the BBC (and later A & E?) produced all the Miss Marple stories with the great British actress Joan Hickson.  Hickson was very close to the written character - she was a charming, polite, occasionally scattered old lady, and yet the look on her face when she observed people showed real intelligence, as well as an acceptance that the world had a lot of dark things in it.  Plus the series clearly made a decision to stay with the Christie plots, and thus they were much more satisfying than any of the previous Miss Marple movies.

  Having said all that, I can't believe that some producing entity decided to remake all these same stories for no apparent reason that I can see.  I have liked Geraldine McEwan twice that I've seen her, and both were in villain roles - as a religioius fanatic mother who is horrible to her lesbian daughter in ""Oranges are Not the Only Fruit"" and as the punishing main nun in ""The Magdalene Sisters.""  As Miss Marple, I find her quirky and a little cutesy-pie and she doesn't radiate with that quiet intelligence Joan Hickson brought to the part.  And though I've only seen a couple of the McEwan episodes, I find them inferior in every regard to the Hickson versions.  So please, if you like Agatha Chrisite or Miss Marple, do yourself a favor and check out the Joan Hickson series, not this one.",1195084800,15,2057,4.628099173553719
2603801,3,B000GAKFIG,"Fine. Here it is. I cannot accept anyone other than Joan Hickson playing Miss Marple. That's the honest truth. I'm not saying that Geraldine McEwan does not do justice to the role. It's just that the producers and directors have given a slant to this entire series that strays a little too far away from the original. Imagine this... supposing Hercule Poirot's main quirks such as neatness, order, method, his waxed mustache and his reliance ""on the little gray cells"" were to be replaced with a physically active detective who prefers to get physical. This is (in a less extreme form) what has happened to Miss Marple. I don't think Agatha Christie would approve!",1195084800,6,664,4.833333333333333
2603802,4,B000GAKFIG,"This is a great follow up to series one.  In particular, Sleeping Murder is great fun, with beautiful scenery, a complex plot and the wonderful Sophia Miles.

8129865,3,B000GAKFIG,"Let me begin by saying that I love Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple although she is far too sprightly and authoritative to conform to Christie's original version of the character (Joan Hickson nailed that, according to Christie herself).

But what ITV has done to the Marple books is appalling.  They didn't need ""updates"".  They didn't need their characters to be changed around and their plots rewritten.  They come off as half-comical in this series and it is indeed a failed attempt at farce.  Truly the only thing left to enjoy in these episodes is the costuming.

But most of all, I'd like to get my hands on the screenwriter who decided it was a good idea to make Tuppence Beresford into a fumbling idiotic middle-aged woman with an alcohol addiction.  It sickens me.  She was such a strong character, from the early short stories in the 1920s to this, Tommy and Tuppence's final adventure, and she didn't need to have all her power taken away by making her into a pathetic 50s wife with empty nest issues who claims she's has no intelligence.  She was always the clever one!  A cruse upon the decision-maker who thought that was a good idea.",1521763200,,1148,4.666666666666667
