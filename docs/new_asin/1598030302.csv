7800015,1,1598030302,"It is hard for me to stomach the professor's coldness toward the vivisection that most of these doctors performed. I know full well that experiments on live animals happened, and it's important to include that in the course. But the professor treated vivisection as if it is a controversy-free, harmless tool that makes the world wonderful.

For instance, his description of cutting open a mammal and watching ""its"" heart slowing as ""it"" died is chilling, and he doesn't seem to realize that it's anything but fascinating. It really turned me off of this course.",1328832000,5,562,4.9787234042553195
