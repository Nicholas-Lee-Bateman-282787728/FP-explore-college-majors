8092904,5,B000BUNFQU,Originally saw it in a movie theater years ago. An amusing and entertaining film with Peter Sellers again playing several roles.,1471910400,,128,5.142857142857143
8092905,5,B000BUNFQU,"I remember watching this movie at a drive-in in the mid 70s. The 'Pink Panther' series was in full swing then, and anything with Peter Sellers caught my interest.
Although it never received much attention in North America, I think it's one of his best movies. This is not the bumbling slapstick antics of Inspector Clousseau, but a
more edgy comedy where Sellers' roles include a sinister Gestapo Inspector, a stiff-upper-lipped British secret agent, a Japanese General and even der Fuhrer himself.
This is not wholesome family viewing as much of the story takes place in a WW2 French brothel, and there are plenty of bared bosoms and sexual references. However,
if you are a Peter Sellers fan like me, you will want to own it. I have been looking for this film on vhs or dvd for years and finally decided to order an import version from another zone. (This same movie was also released under another title -'Undercovers Hero')
Although the Zone 4 DVD will not play in any of my DVD players, I am able to view it on my computer using Cyberlink Power DVD software. There are also DVD players available that are compatable with all zones.",1341360000,2,1136,4.656716417910448

A bit more off-beat, but with some classic lines that have stayed with me for decades!",1304640000,,162,4.4

""What did you do before the War?"" asks a Gestapo Assistant of his boss.
""I was an Income - tax inspector.""
""Quite a change for you, then.""
""Not the way I did it.""
These are typical lines from this TERRIFIC black comedy, a fair vehicle for the innimitable Peter Sellers. He plays - wait for it - a French President, Hitler, Prince Kyoto, General Layour, Schroeder and Major Robinson.
It's about the adventures of Madame Grenier and her girls and their attempt to help the War effort...on both sides. No true - fan of Peter Sellers should miss this movie. It's the ultimate.",1226707200,3,827,5.9
