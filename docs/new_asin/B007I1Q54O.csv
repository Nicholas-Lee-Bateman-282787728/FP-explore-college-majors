5088007,1,B007I1Q54O,"G'day, You know how it is with your favorite show, the people become part of your family. The part with people you'd like to spend time with. Well, if you feel that way this is definitly worth getting. The best part is no comercials, YEA....",1345680000,,241,4.377777777777778
5088008,4,B007I1Q54O,"I first started watching Law & Order Criminal Intent in the spring of 2007 when USA use to have nightly mini-marathons of CI and SVU. The series first aired on NBC on September 30, 2001 until May 21, 2007, when it moved to its sister network USA in the fall of 2007 until it finally ended its run on June 26, 2011. NBCUniversal have been extremely slow about releasing Law & Order: CI's ten year run to DVD. Luckily for us fans, Shout! Factory bought the DVD rights, releasing season 7 exactly one year to the date that the series ended.

Just like the previous few seasons, every other episode is split between the detective combo of Goren/Eames and Logan/Wheeler. Actually, Megan Wheeler (played by Julianne Nicholson, who was on maternity leave) is missing for half the season as the character went to Europe to teach a course on American Police Procedure. During this time, Mike Logan (played by Chris Noth) teams up with Detective Nola Falaccia (played by Alicia Witt).

The season starts out with Amends, in which Eames' (played by Kathryn Erbe) late husband's partner is murdered, and Goren must help her find the killer. My favorite episode is Untethered, where Goren (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) goes undercover in a psychiatric ward to help his nephew and must confront his own demons. The season ends with Frame, where Goren's brother is murdered, and the prime suspect could be Goren's nemesis, Nicole Wallace.

The episodes on the five discs are:

Disc One: Amends; Seeds; Smile; and Lonelyville.

Disc Two: Depths; Courtship; Self-Made; and Offense.

Disc Three: Untethered; Senseless: Purgatory; and Contract.

Disc Four: Betrayed; Assassin; Please Note We Are No Longer Accepting Letters of Recommendation From Henry Kissinger; Reunion; and Vanishing Act.

Disc Five: Ten Count; Legacy; Neighborhood Watch; Last Rites; and Frame.

Unlike the box sets of seasons, 4-6, season seven has no box; there is just a slipcover over a typical DVD case. The DVD cover is in the same design style of the previous few seasons as is the discs' design. Season seven aired from October 7, 2007 to June 24, 2008 and not during the '08-'09 Season as stated on the cover and on each discs. Just like the previous seasons, there are no extras in this set.

Despite the '08-09' error and the lack of extras, I am glad that season 7 is finally on DVD to own.",1343001600,15,2354,4.804455445544554
5088009,5,B007I1Q54O,"Seven Seven brings with it many heart wrenching episodes for the Goren/Eames partnership. I especially loved the episode ""Amends"" where we see the other side to Eames. Her performance in this episode outshone everyone, including her partner whose gentleness and sensitivity was well played by D'onofrio. I wish that Eames got more roles like this to play, because she did it very well. I am impressed with the tortured, mourning uneasy self that Goren depicts, knowing that he is walking on uncertain ground in this season.
Captain Ross continues to play a fine role in this series with his wry, deadpan comments and his ability to control his team despite his height. I like him the best of all the captains for this series and believe me, that world weary turn of phrase that he is good for makes the episodes all the better.
I was never really too impressed with Mike Logan's character and his plethora of partners, but here he gets some really cracking cases to work with and the character takes off, so to speak. I don't care for the Falacci character myself and yes, she is damn irritating. Thank god she gets replaced.
All I can say is that you will not be disappointed with this season. Can't wait for Season 8!!!!!",1341532800,8,1223,4.666666666666667
5088010,5,B007I1Q54O,"The 'Criminal Intent' branch of the ""Law & Order"" Franchise is the slowest to be released on DVD. Ever since Season 1 was released around the Summer of '02, only now-10 years later (& almost 18 months since the Series Finale) is the Seventh Year available! The 'Mother-Show' has been put out as a 20-Season 'Complete Series' (which I purchased here on Amazon.com) last November 6th, 'Special Victims Unit' has all 12 Seasons out w/ the 13th Year being released in September, 'Trial By Jury' has a 'Complete Series' release, as does 'Los Angeles'.
  All of that being pointed out, I am THRILLED to own the 7th Season of 'Criminal Intent'! Some of the Series' best are on this Season, including the fact that it's the 'swan song' for my personal favorite ""Law & Order"" Franchise dective; Mike Logan! My personal highlights for this  DVD Set are; 'LonelyVille', 'Offense'(w/ guest star Andrew McCarthy), 'Senseless', 'Purgatory'( w/ guest star Dean Winters), 'Please Note We Are No Longer Accepting Letters Of Recommendation From Henry Kissinger', & (of course) Logan's final episode 'Last Rites'.
  Alicia Witt (from the film ""88 Minutes"" w/ Al Pacino), who has a handful of episodes as Logan's temp partner is really great (much to my pleasent surprise). I am so happy that Season 7 is finally out & in my DVD Library-where it belongs!
I have ALL of the ""Law & Order"" Franchise DVDs that are available, & am eagerly anticipating the releases of the 8th, 9th & 10th 'Criminal Intent' Seasons. For now, I'm greatful that Year 7 now has a slot on my ""L & O"" DVD shelf!",1340928000,4,1564,4.735294117647059
5088011,5,B007I1Q54O,"Couldn't wait for the DVDs, so got a legal download. I will order these DVDs as well to add to my 1-6 collection. S7, what can I say? Some may disagree, but I'm really into it. On a shallow note, I find Goren compellingly attractive when he's suffering from personal demons which even affect his appearance and the way he performs the job. And suffer he does.

The key 'Goren/Eames' character development episodes are Amends, Untethered, Purgatory and Frame. I have watched them umpteen times, and never find them less than mesmerizing. Seriously, has there been another actor as committed and original as him on network TV? In between those dramatic ones are some more great episodes (Smile, Kissinger, Depths, the magic tricks in 'Vanishing Act'). Even the less-than-stellar ones still have many scenes worth watching. It is heartbreaking indeed to watch the post-Purgatory tension between the partners. I love watching Erbe/Eames in S7.

As for the Logan episodes,  we get a temporary partner 'Falacci' for the first few episodes. Some viewers will love her, and others less so. Personally, I find her a little grating and unrealistic, but I know many do appreciate Alicia Witt's performance. She's better than Bishop at least! The Logan/Falacci episode 'Senseless' is certainly one of the most memorable of the entire S7. 'Last Rites' also a highlight, and it farewells the long-running character of Mike Logan. It left me hoping for something good for his future- too bad he had to leave the show.

Although purists will prefer seasons 1-4 (and 5?), I find the later seasons more emotionally satisfying. If I had to objectively review, of course I won't deny that the earlier seasons are of a much higher quality (especially the writing) and that Goren is quite a different, more quirky and less tortured man. However, despite its unevenness,  the show stayed interesting for me even when it moved to USA. This is due to Vincent's commitment to taking the character of Goren to new places. I simply can't take my eyes off the screen when he fills it.",1332892800,41,2055,4.910662824207493

5088077,5,B007I1Q54O,"What keeps a drama like Law & Order Criminal Intent on the air season after season is not only the acting by the ensemble cast, but also the high profile cases they work.
In the beginning, it was Goran and Eames working the cases, but as the crime rate increased, the work load became too much for two, so 2 new detectives joined the ranks, Logan & Wheeler...in this series, we are introduced to another newcomer.
Criminal Intent is more about the psychological workings of the criminal mind, and makes for compelling viewing.",1376956800,2,526,4.666666666666667
5088078,5,B007I1Q54O,will never stop seeing this show.  I love this show and love the way that the characters solve the puzzles and problems.

SVU still on the air , losing Lenny and other characters to new careers and passing away would leave me sad because of the connection the writers were able to create with the viewer i'll watch my re-runs and buy  all the full series to have in my library. Lt., Green, lupo, Big as we know him being punished and assigned to Staten island all good writing , he gets a second shot as logan joins Criminal intent. Excellent Police show.",1376352000,,568,4.2592592592592595
5088080,5,B007I1Q54O,"Season six didn't really feel like the show anymore. But season 7 felt different in a good way. Here we have everyone returning from season 6, except Jullianne Nicholson who was pregnant. Alicia Witt take her place for a short while in the same sense that Micheal Imporeli takes over for Jesse L. Martin in season 15 of Law & Order. Her character is described as a ""hot-head,"" thus giving Chris Noth's Logan a chance to be the diplomat or the voice of reason. In the season opener, we see the Goren, Eames and Ross respond to the shooting of a police officer. Detective Eames' deceased husband's old partner. It gets personal as Goren outs a cop's disability and re-open's Eames' husband's murder. Most if not all the episodes were top-notch. Warren Leight has made the necessary improvements in season 7 that were needed in season 6. The one change I am not so found of was the Law & Order: Trial By Jury style opening credits and theme music that was for the USA Network airings of new Criminal Intent episodes. It's funny how season 6 was less dark with a serious opening and season 7 was more darker with a fast-paced or even upbeat opening. There are also some noticeable flaws on the Shout Factory DVD box. Dick Wolf's last name is spelled ""Wolfe"" despite his name showing up at least three times throughout an episode and it is mislabeled as the '08-'09 season when in fact it was the '07-'08 season. Hopefully the Shout Factory will pay more attention to future projects and avoid repeats of such mistakes. I strongly recommend that you buy this season despite the minor issues. It's definitely well-written overall and the very compact without having to resort to the annoying double-sided disk. Also this marks Chris Noth's last season as Detective Micheal Logan. Not just in Criminal Intent, but in the entire franchise.",1375056000,4,1831,4.707165109034268
5088081,5,B007I1Q54O,I like Law and Order but especially enjoy this version because of Vincent. The stories are always fascinating and more involved than the regular L&O. I like the psychological aspect of the show and love it when Vincent goes head to head with another highly intelligent but psychotic criminal.,1373328000,3,292,4.979591836734694
5088082,5,B007I1Q54O,"This is one of my favorite years of the series.  I thought the story lines were much better than they had recently been, more like earlier seasons when Goren was quirkier.

5088104,4,B007I1Q54O,I had never seen any of the Law and Order shows while they were on the air. A couple friends mentioned they liked watching the original show. I found the two spinoffs on sale one holiday weekend and bought several as part of my donation to my local library tithe. I had always liked Vincent in the movies I had seen him in. Nice surprise to see him in a TV show since I don't watch much commercial TV. Nave gotten into some good shows that I get from the library on DVD.,1367712000,,470,4.064516129032258

5088129,4,B007I1Q54O,"While the plots continue to be as good as ever, as well as the acting, I feel this season is not as good as its predecessors for the following reasons (spoilers):
- the sudden cast swap out continues, so one fortnight we still have Detective Nola Falacci paired with Mike Logan, then the next fortnight we have Detective Megan Wheeler back with the explanation that she is back from training. But the previous related episode did not give any hint that it was the last pairing of  Falacci. This is poor continuity, although not as bad as previous seasons.
- the development of the plot around the personal life of Robert Goren has stopped, although so much of the previous season was affected by this storyline.",1356739200,2,711,4.642857142857143

5088131,5,B007I1Q54O,"I'm a big CRIMINAL INTENT fan: I own seasons 1-9 on DVD.  I don't have a TV, but TV on DVD is my crack cocaine: it diverts me away from what I should be doing; I watch an episode, then another episode, then another episode, repeat, repeat, repeat, then I notice that I'm exhausted and it's time for bed.  So, I know from experience that I don't dare start watching DVDs until I've already done my writing for the day and I'm too burnt-out to get anything else done constructively.  I like how in season seven they alternate episodes with the original team of detectives and bring in Chris Noth & partner for the other ones.  The only thing I don't like about some of these episodes is the final confession sequence with the ramped-up music (all seasons).
