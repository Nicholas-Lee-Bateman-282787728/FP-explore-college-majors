5878620,4,B00DYBOE0O,"I've only recently just discovered Katrina and Karena, and have really been enjoying their workouts and also participating in their online forum.  (I'm currently doing their vegan Nutrition Plan, and love how easy it makes it to eat clean and healthy!)  Their forum is a great place to check in to get motivation with your workouts and with healthy eating.  The women there are all super supportive and great!

This DVD set -- which just came out in June of this year (2013) -- contains nine brand-new workouts on two DVDs:

*  Set the Bar -- 20 minutes -- designed to be done on a periodic basis to check your fitness levels and progress; you can download a free chart for it on their website
*  Sunrise Routine -- 25  minutes --
*  Fine Toning -- 20 minutes -- light weights for all-over work
*  HIIT the Beach 2 -- 40 minutes -- HIIT cardio moves, interspersed with toning
*  Beach Barre -- 30 minutes -- a fun barre-inspired workout
*  Bikini Arms -- 20 minutes -- arm/upper body focus
*  Hula Booty -- 25 minutes -- a nice mix of standing and floor work
*  Sunkissed Abs -- 18 minutes -- core focus
*  Sunset Stretch -- 15 minutes --  a beautiful stretching routine filmed on the beach while the sun sets

While these workouts don't have the polish and amazing ""fun factor"" of other workouts in my collection, they are still fun to do and I enjoy the low-key aspect of them.  I mentioned this in my review of their first DVD set as well (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beach-Babe-by-Tone-It-Up/dp/B008PK3YGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beach Babe by Tone It Up</a>], but you get a nice workout in a short amount of time, and their shorter length makes them easy to tack on to other workouts.

The thing I love most about these workouts is that each one is filmed on the beach in Maui.  Although soft music plays in the background as you work out, you can also hear the crashing waves.

I also love the warm, encouraging vibe that Karen and Katrina give out.

The DVD set doesn't include a workout calendar or rotation, but if you sign up for emails, they send out a weekly workout schedule that incorporates the DVDs from this set and their first one or their free You Tube workouts.

Also, this second set seems like the workouts are harder than the first set.  I like the more intense pacing of these, and would rate them at a high-intermediate level.

I'm also not sure why the current seller is selling these for close to one-hundred dollars; you can purchase them for about forty-five or so off of their website.",1374883200,16,2560,4.623059866962306

5878634,5,B00DYBOE0O,"How can you not enjoy this dvd! I really like the picturesque background of Hawaii while working out. They are both so encouraging and motivating. The dvd includes multiple workouts, like a sunrise and sunset workout, hiit training, toning for specific areas and more. What is great about this dvd is you only need the one. I also love the waterbreaks that are included during your workout.",1405814400,2,390,4.835820895522388
5878635,5,B00DYBOE0O,Great workouts to choose from!,1405123200,,30,5.2
5878636,5,B00DYBOE0O,I love these workouts. I feel like I definitely worked out. I used muscles that I didn't normally use with other workouts. I workout at 530 am and these DVDs are such a nice way to ease into my hectic schedule.  I LOVE the HIIT the beach workout. It's been my favorite so far.,1402963200,,276,4.111111111111111
5878637,5,B00DYBOE0O,Great mix of cardio and strength training in the HIIT workout and the strength routines really target those hard to tone areas.,1401321600,,127,4.818181818181818
5878638,5,B00DYBOE0O,All of these workouts are great.  They vary in intensity which I really like and I appreciate that they have workouts for individual areas of the body.  I use these at least 3 times a week and really like them.,1400544000,,210,4.225
5878639,1,B00DYBOE0O,"It didn't come with closed caption as was supposed to. I was told it has the closed caption, so I could understand and be able to follow it. A little unmotivated.",1396742400,,162,4.258064516129032
5878640,5,B00DYBOE0O,Great direction and toning.  Girls make it fun along with beautiful scenery.  Their attitudes are uplifting and their bodies are very motivating!,1396224000,5,145,5.545454545454546
5878641,5,B00DYBOE0O,"Awesome DVD, so happy with the workouts. This is challenging and fun. I wish I would have bought both. Definitely recommend this!!",1396137600,,130,4.954545454545454
5878642,5,B00DYBOE0O,"I used to take yoga, zumba and kickboxing classes and I have to say that these DVDs are just as challenging.  Lots of yoga moves, holding positions and frequent switching up of positions makes this workout pretty hard, yet entertaining and fun!  My husband even tried it and couldn't finish.  I would recommend this to all of my friends :)",1394755200,6,339,4.616666666666666
5878643,5,B00DYBOE0O,Love it! They do such a great job of keeping you going throughout the video. Their friendship makes it even better!,1394323200,,115,4.523809523809524
5878644,5,B00DYBOE0O,The ToneItUp girls are great in this DVD.  I'm very glad to have this work-out DVD to get me ready for summer.,1393891200,,110,4.0
5878645,5,B00DYBOE0O,These girls are very motivational! Beach view is Great! Workouts are Fun and Challenging!! Great price for all these workouts! Now I need the first one!,1393632000,,152,4.884615384615385
5878646,5,B00DYBOE0O,The work outs are great and there also very motivating. Katrina and Karena  they are great examples. And I love it.,1392681600,,115,4.476190476190476
5878647,5,B00DYBOE0O,"Even though the workouts are challenging, they are still fun to do. It's also nice that you have the option to play them with music or without. These trainers are amazing and they do the routines with you. Love these girls!",1392595200,,223,4.463414634146342
5878648,5,B00DYBOE0O,"I really like the workouts, very easy to do at home and you can put together whatever workout combo you like!",1392076800,,109,4.238095238095238
5878649,5,B00DYBOE0O,"I really am liking these workouts, the toning is doing the trick. After surgery had to modify but still feel. Keep them coming ladies!!!",1391644800,,136,4.708333333333333
5878650,5,B00DYBOE0O,"Loved these videos!!!! So many different workouts and different things. You can definitely feel the burn!! I was pleasantly surprised that these were actually really hard. The only downside is ALL the breaks in the videos! I don't get it, some are only 15mins and have 2 breaks!! It's a video and we are home, we can press pause if need be and for those who want to keep going, we should have that option!!! It was very frustrating to stop just when you are starting to feel the burn.",1391212800,6,484,4.388888888888889
5878657,4,B00DYBOE0O,What a work out! Much harder than anticipated but easy to follow. Targeted exercises. Plus I appreciate the great tips and recipes.,1390521600,2,131,5.0
5878658,4,B00DYBOE0O,"This is a great little system. But will bore those who are in good shape and need HIIT work outs and weights. I love this because the workouts are 30(isn) minutes each, and they are not high intensity. (I live up stairs in an apartment and can't make to much noise) All you need is a yoga matt, weights and a water. I totally love that it was filmed in Hawaii too! These girls are fun and hopefully will come out with a few more DVD's soon.",1390003200,5,440,4.068965517241379
5878659,2,B00DYBOE0O,I tried playing the dvd's on a few of our Xbox's and it would not work on any of them. All of my other workout videos work on our Xbox's so I assumed this would work too. We don't have a dvd player so I can't use the dvd's.  It's a bummer. I was excited about doing the workouts.,1389830400,3,279,3.7288135593220337
5878660,4,B00DYBOE0O,"Such a great DVD with a variety of workouts. I love how it's filmed on the beach and the girls' laidback vibe. Don't let them fool you though, the workouts are tough and effective. You will see a difference in your body very quickly.",1389657600,3,233,4.318181818181818
5878661,2,B00DYBOE0O,"I would not recommend this workout video for beginners.  As a beginner myself, I found it very difficult and challenging.  They try to tailor the video to specific parts of the body but the workouts are far too extensive on that one body part making it very challenging.  In addition, each workout is only 20 minutes long.  I felt like I had to do two videos to work out at least three body parts and get a decent workout.

In addition, the video is very poorly made.  The girls lips are not in sync with the words.  The camera man will be shooting her legs and she will be discussing how to move her arms, so you have no idea what is going on.",1389398400,13,644,4.145161290322581
5878662,5,B00DYBOE0O,Really great as DVD to do at home. The routines are quite varied and you can mix & match depending on how long you want to work out for. Both the trainers are enthusiastic & motivating and I find I push myself more thinking I will look like them one day...,1387756800,4,256,4.03921568627451
5878663,5,B00DYBOE0O,"Love the workouts, they are great!  Karena and Katrina have done an amazing job with the Beach Babe 2 DVD.  I would highly recommend it.  I use it almost every day!",1384819200,2,164,4.225806451612903
5878664,5,B00DYBOE0O,"Best $40 I ever spent! Cheaper than a month at a gym, convenient in my own home and easy to squeeze in a couple workouts throughout the day when I have time. Its been less than a month and I'm already seeing results. Not to mention how motivational is to watch the girls workout in such beautiful locations!!! Like a mini vacation each time I work out! I look forward to these workouts and will continue using this DVD for months to come!",1383868800,11,438,4.289156626506024
5878665,4,B00DYBOE0O,I love the Tone it Up team and have found many of their routines from Youtube to be very effective.  I was not able to do and did not like a few of these and decided it wasn't worth it to keep this for the few I did like.,1382400000,3,221,3.510204081632653
5878666,5,B00DYBOE0O,"Tone it up has hit another home run!  These ladies know their stuff.  I did the Sunrise workout yesterday and am amazed at the spots that are sore today: Hips, inner thighs, shoulders and my personal favorite - the lower abs.  Great job Karena & Katrina!  I have quite the collection of work out DVD's, but some of them are too obnoxious to work with; sorry Jillian & the Brazilian Butt dude - your workout's are great, but I can't relate to your coaching styles.

I've been looking for a new workout series that would help me reach my physical goals and had more low key, not condescending, personal trainers.  For me, this fit my criteria.  I love the location these work outs are set in!  You can hear & see the waves washing up on shore in the background, and the soft music and cues by the trainers are spot on.  The Beach Babes DVD puts me in a great place in my mind because I actually feel as though I'm transforming into a beach babe along with the trainers.  It's like you're working out with you best friends on the beach in Hawaii!  Their routines are for all levels because you do as many reps in the set as you can.  I'm really glad I purchased these DVD's, they're very different from what's in my collection and I will be putting them in my regular rotation.  I think I'll purchase some of the Bethanny Frankel DVD's next because I enjoy the mellow, sunny side of life attitude in both Beach Babes & Bethanny's DVD's.

On a side note, like the other reviewer mentioned, I purchased these on the beachbabedvd website for $40.  For an additional $15, I was able to purchase the first series with it.  I don't know why it's selling for such a high price here.  Also, if you join their email list, they will send you monthly training calendars & recipes.",1375747200,7,1766,4.368098159509202
8599089,5,B00DYBOE0O,Awesome DVDs easier to get fit when you enjoy what you're doing I love the variety of workouts and the beautiful Hawaiian locations are motivational. Sunrise Routine was so nice. I would own all BB programs if they were made into DVDs,1506297600,,234,4.595238095238095
8599090,5,B00DYBOE0O,"These girls are so much fun to work out to. I bought this set on a whim, I am an intermediate exerciser, and I am in my fifties. I like variety, and these girls were a recent choice to try. I like their routines, nothing is so complex you can't do it, and they are both very sincere about helping you get into shape--it comes across very well. The beach setting is perfect; love hearing the waves. You will need to set up your own schedule for which ones you do, but ultimately, there is no right or wrong for the order. I haven't done this long enough to clarify results, but I certainly believe these can get you into shape, or if you are in an intermediate-level shape already, it will work some different muscles, which is good. I am certainly piqued to get another set or sign up for their challenges. They are a lot of fun and positive, and we all can use that when working out.",1496534400,,884,4.205882352941177
8599091,3,B00DYBOE0O,kind of slower and for more of the intermediate exerciser.,1496188800,,58,4.9
8599092,5,B00DYBOE0O,"I love these workouts. I used to be a dancer but since I've been in my last year of college sometimes I can't make it to the gym or barre class, I've started to do these a long with my ballet beautiful videos. If you commit to doing them I definitely think you'll get results.",1455235200,,276,4.036363636363636
8599093,5,B00DYBOE0O,"Love these workouts!!!  They really get to the areas, all areas, but you can pick and choose your workouts to make your own program.  Easy to follow.  Get results by working these DVD's!!!",1428537600,,188,4.636363636363637
8599094,2,B00DYBOE0O,Video does not play well.  Freezes alot,1427587200,,39,4.571428571428571
8599095,2,B00DYBOE0O,"Unfortunately I didn't care for this dvd.  I found the moves very awkward, slow paced and i barely broke a sweat.  The trainers are inspiring as they look great adn love the ocean in the background however, this dvd is def not worth the price.  Jillian Michaels' 30 day shred leaves my heart rate high and is much cheaper!",1425081600,,322,4.423728813559322
8599096,5,B00DYBOE0O,Love Tone It Up girls! I do workouts from this DVD everyday. The 40 minute HIIT workout is such an awesome challenge. The beach setting is enjoyable and the workouts are fluid and effective. My favorite part is the energy of the girls. They make working out fun and motivating. Love this DVD!,1424044800,,292,4.528301886792453
8599097,2,B00DYBOE0O,"The Beach Babe dvd's are beautiful to watch and most of the workouts are decent. However, there are some things that bother me.

Firstly Karena isn't great a queuing the next moves (Katrina is good at this because she has experience outside of youtube/TIU). As a student in group fitness classes or doing workout dvds this can be extremely frustrating because then you and the instructor aren't on the same page and you feel like you're a beat behind. As an instructor (which I am) it means lots of confused looks and students who don't come back because they felt lost. She also sometimes has poor form and doesn't finish the move completely before moving onto the next. The biggest thing that bothered me is that in her yoga routine she didn't queue well at all, had poor form, and she did some advanced moves that could lead to injuries. Before TIU she was a model, not a personal or group trainer. She is a certified personal trainer now but clearly she doesn't have a yoga or group fitness cert because one of the most important things they teach is injury prevention and how to queue properly for both visual and audio learners.

Another thing I didn't like is the background noise. On the arms routine you can hear a guy yelling in the back ground a few times. In a few other routines you can see and hear cars driving on the road behind them (they could have edited the moving cars out). The camera work was weird too, like they'd be doing arms and the camera would pan to their lower bodies which weren't moving, or the camera would move to the side so only half their face/body was showing on 1/4 the screen and the rest was sand.

I'm glad I got this dvd on sale because it's not worth the full price. If it cost the same as most other dvds I would give them a pass on some things but since they want to charge a high price I expect high quality and this is not it.",1421280000,17,1876,4.323863636363637
8599098,3,B00DYBOE0O,"First a little about myself: I'm an active person. I surf, rockclimb and do yoga. I take spinning classes and do P90X and P90X3 at home. I recently injured my shoulder and can't do my usual strength training workouts for a couple of months. I got this as my workout for the next couple of months while I recover.

Here's my two cents about the Beach Babe 2 workouts: too easy. I didn't break a sweat during the HIIT the Beach II workout and I was pushing myself. I don't feel like I burned many calories. There are so many water breaks -- every time it feels like I'm getting my heart rate up, it's break time. All of that being said, I'd definitely recommend this workout for beginners or anyone who's really out of shape. It's short, easy and you use really light weights. I",1415232000,,776,4.315068493150685
