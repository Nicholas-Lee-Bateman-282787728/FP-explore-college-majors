8178931,3,B000NJXBJK,"The only information I can find on this set is an ad on TigerDirect. If that ad is for this product, it is actually 250 movies plus 100 TV episodes. It is a bundle of six previously released movie and TV packs:

1. Family Classics 50 Movie Pack released in 2004, 16 dollars
2. All Stars 50 Movie Pack, released in 2004, 26 dollars
3. Comedy Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection, released 2004, 13 dollars
4. Hollywood Legends 50 Movie Pack, released 2004, 19 dollars
5. Musicals Classics 50 Movie Pack, released 2005, 19 dollars
6. TV Favorites Megapack 100 Episodes Collection, released 2004, 27 dollars

The prices come from what this site is currently charging for each of these products individually. If you read all of the comments by reviewers of these individual bundles it seems to boil down to this - people seem satisfied overall with these bundles, although they are the least satisfied with the ""All Stars"" and ""Hollywood Legends"" collection. More than a few people are upset with the video quality, and pretty much everyone agrees these are all B movies, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are not entertaining. The cost on this site for buying the entire bundle is significantly less than buying the sets separately at a cost of 120 dollars. However, TigerDirect has this same exact set on sale for 50 dollars. Also, I'm familiar with quite a few of the titles, and I'm pretty sure you wouldn't want your kids breaking open just any of these DVDs if you are not familiar with some of the movies. In some cases the topics can be rather mature, though nothing worse than anything you would see in a movie from the 1960's. I am assigning a three star rating because it seems that you get great quantity, but only so-so and in some cases poor video quality, and average to above average entertainment quality. My personal experience with this manufacturer's product is that I have the Comedy Classics and Horror Classics sets, and I have been pretty happy with both of them. The video quality is good but not great, as is the quality of the movies themselves. I'd give both of those two sets four stars, but then I wasn't expecting Kino Home Video quality either.",1172275200,7,2174,4.658854166666667
