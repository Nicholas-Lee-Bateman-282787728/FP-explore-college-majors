8139153,5,B000HEWENU,"Whoever Says the Truth Shall Die offers a detailed account of not only Pasolini's untimely and controversial death, but his successes as a poet, painter and filmmaker.  Many of Pasolini's closest friends share their personal memories of Pasolini including a charming yet bizarre story of Bertolucci's first meeting Pasolini as a young boy in Italy.  Though short in duration, the film is loaded with content and intercut with footage from Pasolini's films as well as his poems.

For casual and fanatics alike, this documentary is accessible for anyone who wants a first hand account of Pasolini's life.  Highly Recommended.",1317686400,2,623,5.262626262626263
8139154,4,B000HEWENU,"This is not an autobiography or film tribute of the great Provacateur, Pier Paolo Pasolini, but does provide rare glimpses of the man. Archival footage of Pasolini, his films, poetry readings, and interviews with his friends are what this short documentary offers. Pasolini was always a controversial and critical figure in Italy, so any political group would have fared better if he were deceased. Inflamatory indictments of the Christian Democrats, and his film, Salo, were released about a month prior to his untimely death.

In my opinion and many others, his bloody and brutal murder could not have been committed by one person (Pino), which was initially supported in the trial. Somehow, this supposition was elimintated before sentencing Pino the Frog as the sole murderer. The case was reopened in 2005, but was later shut the same year, remaining inconclusive. The case has recently been reopened once again; hopefully, the truth will surface.

Pasolini's violent end is a tragic loss: he remains one of the most important cultural contributors of the twentieth century.

8139155,3,B000HEWENU,"I saw this film a while back.  While it is interesting (especially if you're a Pasolini admirer), it really doesn't delve into Pasolini himself.  It's also very short (barely an hour), and rather pricey considering its length.  Pasolini was an extremely complex, intelligent, articulate, eclectic man, a poet, filmmaker, novelist, playwright, and political writer.  He deserves a longer, more detailed documentary.  This film mainly concentrates on his murder and the aftermath (which was really murky and controversial).  Officially, he was killed by Giuseppe ""Pino the Frog"" Pelosi, a sometime hustler and small time crook, but most believe he was killed by Fascist elements in Italy, and that Pelosi was the fall guy.  The murder case of Pasolini was recently opened up again.  If you really want to know Pasolini, read Barth David Schwartz's masterful biography, Pasolini Requiem.",1169942400,6,884,5.401459854014599
8139156,4,B000HEWENU,"It's wonderful that this previously super-rare title is finally coming to DVD! I have  a bootleg VHS from ages ago. It is a provocative and sad documentary from 1981 that tells of the late,great Pier Paolo Pasolini's life,art and, ultimately, his tragic murder in 1975.

 Very well done; features actors and friends from his films and the literary world.

Beware though, it DOES show graphic photographs of his disfigured, battered corpse in close up detail. If you have heard of Pasolini's fate, but never actually witnessed it, you may want to spare yourself the horrific sight. (If you're a fan and would rather remember him as he was in life.)",1161216000,7,647,4.8545454545454545
