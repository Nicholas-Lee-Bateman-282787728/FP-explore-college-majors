6991271,5,B00SL9CXOS,"What a a great movie,one of my favorites. Our kids love it, we adults love it..it is full of action and the acting is great and captivating!
It is an excellent adventure film. Just what a movie should be!
I believe that this movie doesn't recieve the recognition that it deserves. I would have givin it 6 stars but there were only 5. This movie is worth seeing!!",1430092800,,362,4.338235294117647
6991272,5,B00SL9CXOS,"Well, i am not going to talk here about how the film goes on :-). I have a different experienced how this film fascinated seven thousand and five hundred kids (with lots of adults too) in five days :-))).

I have seen this film last year in November at the Gijon 50th Film Festival with one thousand and five hundreds students at the auditorium. It had 5 days screening during the film festival and the auditorium was full everytime. The reactions from the audience was enormously amazing!!! They were very excited and gave a stand ovation at the end of the film. After the screening, Jo Kastner, the director, gave an interview for the students. Those students were ages from 6 to 15.  And they know the story of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn very well as they read and discussed the book at their literature subject. Those young fellows were so glad to have met the great director of their favorite film (according to them). The questions and answers was indeed a success and helpful for those students who are interested to be in a Film industry in the future! I am 41 years old and i must say that: THIS FILM IS A DECENT ADAPTATION OF MARK TWAIN MASTERPIECE!!!",1430092800,6,1166,4.521327014218009
6991273,5,B00SL9CXOS,"This movie is great! I have grown up watching old Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn movies and reading the books.

6991275,2,B00SL9CXOS,Very disappointed this movie isn't more like the book. I was so excited to show it to my students but now I'm having to search for another movie version.,1428710400,3,153,4.310344827586207

6991278,1,B00SL9CXOS,"This was painfully bad. There are actors with potential that must have been instructed to pretend that they'd never acted or spoken...ever...in front of a camera...ever. As a fan of Twain's stories, this movie does an abysmal job of reflecting the culture, language, and style of the books. The scenes that should have been fun...were boring.

6991280,4,B00SL9CXOS,"Okay, having just watched this movie and reading through a few of the reviews here, Ive got to jump to the defense of this production. I liked it a lot. This film is clearly blending the two books together in some aspects. If you're looking for an adaptation of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, this isn't it and it isn't exactly trying to be. If you actually pay attention at the beginning, you would understand that this was supposed to be Mark Twain verbally telling some of Tom and Huck's adventures. He wasn't sitting down and reading the stories as he wrote them. I personally like the direction they went here, and I was briefly irritated near the beginning before I understood where the filmmakers were going with this. If you reviewed the film poorly, just watch it again. Mark Twain is my favorite author. My dog's name is Huckleberry Finn.",1524614400,,847,4.6158940397351

6991284,1,B00SL9CXOS,Boring movie.  Makes assumptions that the viewer knows the entire backstory to Tom and Huck.  Doesn't show the mischievousness of Tom Sawyer.,1520035200,,141,5.363636363636363
6991285,2,B00SL9CXOS,Not appropriate for children. Might be okay for teens. My child said it was scary due to dead bodies and gore. There is a lot of cursing throughout.,1519776000,,148,4.321428571428571
6991286,4,B00SL9CXOS,I think it was a great movie but it twisted the story alot. That's not a bad thing because it was a really good movie,1518652800,,117,3.72
6991287,1,B00SL9CXOS,"saying this is the story of Tom Sawyer  is RIDICULOUS.

This story completely mangled the story.

They combined parts that did not happen together.

cut the Ben Rogers part where Tom, Ben, and Huckleberry ran away from home.

Completely cut out the part where Huckleberry Finn saved the Widow Douglas's life, and why she took him in to raise.

the end of the movie says that Tom and Hick never saw one another again.

this is not true.

in Huckleberry Finn Tom Sawyer and Huck set the runaway slave free.

in Tom Sawyer Abroad Tom, Huck, and Jim travel to Africa in a balloon

In Tom Sawyer Detective Tom, Huck, and Jim works to clear Tom's uncle Silas Phelps of murder.

I have seen bad tellings of this story but THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST!

Read some of the greatest stories ever in American Literature.

I read Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, and Tom Sawyer along with the 5 Amber Chronicles,  the first 6 Conrad Stargard novels every year.",1516406400,2,939,4.511904761904762
6991288,2,B00SL9CXOS,"Does not follow the literary story.  Mixes up elements between two books, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, into one story, and it just doesn't work.  I don't  write many reviews, but this story really irritated me as it messed up a literature classic.",1515283200,17,251,4.790697674418604

6991290,5,B00SL9CXOS,"The best version of this classic I have seen. Courtney and McNamara are fantastic, Noah Munck is the bomb and Kilmer as good as always.",1510185600,,135,4.44
6991291,5,B00SL9CXOS,I absolutely loved it! Very interesting new version of an old story. Courtney and Kilmer are fantastic. I recommend it.,1510185600,,119,5.0

6991296,5,B00SL9CXOS,I think this is the best version yet of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Jake T. Austin and Joel Courtney are two of my favorite actors. They made a good pair for the film. It seems to me every 20 years there's always a remake of a Tom Sawyer movie. I only wish this version was exactly like the novel.,1485043200,,302,4.05
6991297,1,B00SL9CXOS,"This film has very little to do with the book, so if you're a student planning to watch this instead of reading the book, think again.  Beyond that, this movie is an abomination and an insult to the memory of Mark Twain.  While I don't mind modernizations of novels, generally, Huck Finn in wrist wraps and choker (not to mention his inconsistent use of modern slang and an accent that is more appropriate to Mississippi than Missouri), is beyond the pale. Even Kilmer's performance is lackluster--he's capable of MUCH better, which suggests to me he couldn't be bothered to put in more than a phone call for this incarnation of his Mark Twain. (I could swear that even his wig is on crooked.)  Add to that a St. Petersburg that looks more akin to Dodge City than Hannibal, and I'm simply gobsmacked that this managed to get green-lighted for distribution.",1479168000,12,856,4.693333333333333
6991298,3,B00SL9CXOS,The movie is worth a watch. Performances are energetic. The Twain segues are not needed and distract,1469232000,,100,4.9411764705882355

I had to fast forward parts because the action dragged.  After about 40 minutes I shut the DVD player off.

6991316,3,B00SL9CXOS,"I'm not a professional reviewer, but here goes. I enjoyed the movie even though it is a family style movie. The young actors were good in their roles and I would recommend it for an evening movie for a family with young teens or younger.",1442534400,,237,4.288888888888889
6991317,3,B00SL9CXOS,"Val Kilmer made an excellent Mark Twain.  The movie was good and mostly faithful to the book, but the obvious PC left a lot of the main  characterizations as written by Twain, out of the film. Good sunday night addition to your watch list for family night.",1442102400,,256,4.425531914893617

6991320,2,B00SL9CXOS,"I wanted so badly to like this. I don't understand why Hollywood thinks it should rewrite Mark Twain's excellent original dialogue. The dumbing down of a great American classic is heartbreaking. The scenery is great, but the dialogue is terrible. And why, oh why, didn't they tap Hal Holbrook to perform as Mark Twain? A lost opportunity all around. I'll stick with the 1938 version of Tom Sawyer.",1438214400,6,397,4.852941176470588
6991321,3,B00SL9CXOS,"Let me be brutally honest with you. I am not even sure why I got this movie. I was always bored by the story and that was the written one. I was always bored by any iteration of the story in a movie, too. Why did I think that a more modern look would improve it any. It didn't! Dear God, it is still a bore. The young performers tried and I give them that.",1438128000,,356,3.76
6991322,1,B00SL9CXOS,Bad attempt to modernize a historical story.  Doesn't fill the bill.  Val Kilmer as Mark Twain was dreadful.  The sound was as if it were recorded in his garage.,1436745600,14,161,4.482758620689655
6991323,5,B00SL9CXOS,I really did enjoy this movie and I think Jake Austin and Joel Courtney did an excellent job here I wouldn't change a thing I loved the surprise ending  I diffently recommend to everyone.,1436745600,,187,4.5
6991324,4,B00SL9CXOS,Good movie for kids.,1436400000,,20,4.25
6991325,5,B00SL9CXOS,I showed this to my class after finish reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. The movie included the important scenes from the book like the white washing fence chapter and the murder of Muff Potter. Afterwards my students kept talking about how great the movie was. The movie had a different order of chapters than the book did. That turned into a good venn diagram assignment with discussing the differences and similarities to the movie. This was shown to 9th graders and I would definitely recommend it.,1435449600,,506,4.827586206896552

6991328,5,B00SL9CXOS,"This movie is very respectful to the classic literature of Mark Twain and the period it represents. Superb casting in spite of the use of unknown low-cost actors. Light use of computer generated visual effects with great characters and production values made this movie a gem. Don't pass up this film.  No, I'm not a shrill for this movie.  I rented it from Redbox and watched for the first time.  It exceeded my expectations.",1434153600,,426,4.72972972972973

6991332,4,B00SL9CXOS,"Joel Courtney did a very good job.  He was believable, wore costume well, talked the part, walked the part.
I have probably all the Huck and Tom movies available.  The only thing this one had was a great choice for the
part of Huck, but something about Austin fell far short of the mark.  He is normally a fine actor, but something
in this movie held him back.  His interrelation with Courtney did not meet what one would expect from my
opinion.  While going along with Tom in all of the antics, his heart was not in it.  Whethere Jake was held back
for some reason by production, or maybe he was sick during filming. But it was very disappointing acting on his part.
I'd recommend the movie if you keep in mind this is not the way Huck Finn is usually portrayed.  The addition
of Mark Twain introducing the story and then interjecting himself a few times added to my liking of the movie.
Also of interest was Tom calling Finn ""Hucky"".",1433289600,,935,4.369942196531792

6991334,3,B00SL9CXOS,"It didn't hold my interest.  The kids' acting was mediocre, so not too convincing.  Some of the best parts in Twain's book, such as the graveyard scene, weren't suspenseful/interesting/compelling.  The movie really failed to draw me into the time period or the drama.",1431129600,10,267,5.162790697674419
6991335,3,B00SL9CXOS,"The set is good, cinematography nice (beautiful at times actually), costumes believable. It should be at least a 4 star, but the directing is barely 1 star quality. At 1st I was thrown off by how old Tom and Huck are. Huck's voice has even changed and you can see his Adam's apple. So they chose older more experienced actors? Flat, no chemistry between the boys, no mischievousness in Tom's eyes, no admiration from Huck for Tom's imagination. I don't ever remember Tom calling Huck 'Huckie"" either, yuck! Then I watched the rest of the cast, adults and they're all just robots going through the motions. Twain's skill is the only thing that keeps this movie going.

I saw the movie recently and was fascinated. How well this movie was made to tell the old time story in fresh and exciting pictures.
 As a boy we all dreamed about the life of tom sawyer and huck. we even went to bed reading the book under the covers just not to miss a minute of the tale.
The story is an all-time evergreen and shows what can be done nowadays bringing these old-time feelings back to life.
