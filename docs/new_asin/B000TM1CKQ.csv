2906918,5,B000TM1CKQ,"Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin and Barney. TV's quirkiest set of friends since NBC's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friends/dp/B000H6SXMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friends</a>&nbsp;are back with 22 more sensational episodes in How I Met Your Mother - Season Two. Following the Season One finale breakup of Marshall and Lily which resulted in Lily leaving for San Francisco on an art internship, leaving Marshall emotionally lost, Season Two opens with the gang helping Marshall cope with the void left by his ""Lilypad"" which, of course, leads to hilarious situations.

Also returning for Season Two is director Pamela D. Fryman, who again guides the episodes (19 of 22) with her pitch perfect direction. As with Season One, all 22 episodes of How I Met Your Mother - Season Two are a delight and not to be missed.

How I Met Your Mother - Season Two
Highly Recommended!",1186963200,23,2242,5.2745098039215685
2906919,5,B000TM1CKQ,"This show takes the audience on a bit of a backwards journey down memory lane. The premise has the narrator (Ted) telling his two children the story of how he met their mother. Along the way we meet Lilly and Marshall (known to each other by the sickeningly sweet nicknames Marshmellow and Lillypad) who are a funny, picture perfect cute couple (well...they are now, anyway, after their relationship trouble in season 1). We also meet Robin (Ted's on again, off again girlfriend who turns out *not* to be his future wife) and that rascally womanizing egomaniac, Barney.

I think the casting in this show was outstanding. Neil Patrick Harris shines as Barney, and Alyson Hannigan puts forth a brilliant performance each episode as Lilly. The character of Ted is a good fit for Josh Radnor (who we have thus far only seen in small bit parts in various films, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Not-Another-Teen-Movie-Unrated-Director-s-Cut/dp/B0009P42WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Not Another Teen Movie (Unrated Director's Cut)</a>. Jason Segal and Cobie Smulders round out the cast nicely as Marshall and Robin. (and if you think you might recognize the voice of the ""older Ted Mosbey"" during the narrating portion of the show...it's probably because you do. The narrator is actually Bob Saget).

Season 2 pretty much picks up where season 1 left off. In a bizarre case of cold feet, Lilly breaks off her engagement with Marshall and moves to California for an art internship. Marshall is left in New York, alone and heartbroken, while Robin and Ted strike out in their new relationship (despite the fact that they both know they want very different things out of life). Barney, as always, provides much of the comic relief throughout the show, and remains his usual womanizing self. Season 2, from start to finish, is hilarious. I particularly enjoyed the episodes ""Ted Mosbey, Architect"" and (my all time favorite episode so far) ""Robin Sparkles"". When you watch them, you'll see why (I seriously couldn't erase the episode Robin Sparkes from my TiVo for like a month, because I just kept re-watching it!).

The dialogue is sharp and witty, and the interpersonal relationships within the group are really fun to watch. I can't ever get through an episode without laughing out loud at least once, and I think thats a good sign for a comedy sitcom. This is situational comedy at it's finest, and while the storylines and situations aren't believable in an apply-it-to-real-life sort of way, it's nonetheless entertaining and humorous, which is sort of the point.

The season 1 box set contained at least 5 episodes with writer/director/producer commentary (with the season finale episode containing commentary from the 5 principle actors). Hopefully season 2 will have the same, because a lot of the commentary is really entertaining!

Bottom line, this is a great show. I'm going out on a limb here (a very high, terrifying limb) but I think this show has the potential to at least partially fill the shoes of shows like ""Friends"" and ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", as far as filling the half-hour comedy sitcom void is concerned. Give it a try, and I promise you won't be disappointed.",1186617600,34,3231,5.158396946564886
2906920,5,B000TM1CKQ,"This is the best TV show of the last 5 years in my opinion.  This show (and Scrubs) single handedly saved me from throwing my TV out the window.  In a world where reality television is king, HIMYM saves the sitcom format.  Even with the forever-parodied ""laugh track"", the show works.  Focusing on Ted Moesby, he is looking for ""Miss Right"" while, 30 years into future his older counterpart (voiced by Bob Saget) is relaying each weeks adventure to his children.  There are some great episodes in this season, but maybe the greatest episode is ""Slap Bet"".  I cannot imagine the DVD being anything less than Legen......dary!",1185840000,17,623,4.775700934579439

There should be some notification somewhere letting those that live outside of your region know that these DVDs will not play for them.

2906964,5,B000TM1CKQ,"I have loved all seasons of HIMYM. Actually started watching them after the show finale. I had watched a few episodes here and there in the beginning and never could get interested: I thought the Barney character in particular was unlikeable and unbelievable. Was I ever wrong. I have seen every single episode in order and watched more repeat episodes than I care to admit. Barney is hands down my favorite character but they are all good. Such good acting, such good directing; a wonderfully put together show. Maybe it all reminds me of when I was that age and had a group of five friends: three girls and two guys. We just had a blast together and I ended up marrying one of the guys:)",1454371200,,689,4.476190476190476

Also Barney will be a big player on how things work out for a very big important reunion (you'll know by the middle of the season). Also I will say the ending was, in my opinion, bittersweet but season 3 will be worth it. Hope this was not too vague. Enjoy!",1417046400,,427,4.156626506024097

2907437,5,B000TM1CKQ,"How do you rebound from a cliff hanger like Marshall and Lily breaking up? Right where you left off.

Season two starts moments after we learn about the split with Barney and Robin rushing to Marshall's side. I love that they let the break up go on for a while and didn't opt for a quick one episode fix. Therein lies a big reason I feel that the show is so wildly successful, because they explore real situations. They realize break ups hurt and they let Marshall hurt...and hurt...and hurt some more. All the while his friends rally around him to help him try and forget, or at least not dwell on, what happened. In classic HIMYM form, some very funny results ensue, from Barney taking him to a strip club to Ted taking him to a baseball game (ending with Marshall freaking out on a newly engaged couple) and Robin, of course, taking him to the gun range.

Now that's not all that happens. Of course, Robin and Ted are officially an item so we get ample comedy from them. Lily comes back from San Francisco to commence a funny round of apartment hunting. Ted finds out his parents got a divorce. And Barney...well, Barney does what Barney does best, chases women. All of that leads up to Marshall and Lily's wedding.

Their wedding could've been handled in so many different ways, and it could've failed in so many ways. However, they cover the wedding over the span of two episodes. Everything from pre-wedding jitters to how everything will always go wrong, to their own private ceremony headed by none other than Barney. They did it perfectly.

All in all, season two builds upon what season one started in all the right ways. There are no midseason lulls, only laughs offered throughout. With huge heart and a wonderful cast there's nothing missing.",1326931200,,1755,4.597444089456869
2907438,5,B000TM1CKQ,I watched this through my ROKU. It's a great way to purchase tv shows! I love that Amazon saves your purchases for you there. Adore this episode! Robin Sparkles.,1326758400,,161,4.586206896551724

The original showed up yesterday 1/12 (a month late) and I was able to go on line and print out my return label very simply! As far as the product goes my Goddaughter was enjoying 5 minutes after she opened it on Christmas.  Thank you

The package wasn't so good, the piece that holds disc 1 and 2 was loose in the case and discs had scratches and stains. Although discs worked fine, I was disappointed with the quality so I contacted Amazon and they were nice enough to gave me a refund over this purchase!
That's why I gave it five stars: the combination of LEGENDARY TV SHOW and AWESOME STORE!",1296518400,,552,4.216981132075472
2907444,5,B000TM1CKQ,"""How I Met Your Mother"" Season 2 continues the story of Ted's search for his future bride and mother of his children. All cast members return including Josh Radnor, Jason Segel, Alyson Hannigan, Cobie Smulders (yes she DOES), and Neil Patrick Harris as well as Bob Saget narrating as older Ted Mosby. Spoiler Alert! At the end of Season 1, Lily and Marshall broke up. At the end of Season 2 is one of the best television weddings I have ever seen. Also at the end of Season 1, Ted and Robin got together despite fundamental differences in their future paths. I won't spoil what happens to them by the end....

This is a funny season where the ""Slap Bet"" originates wherein Marshall earns the right to slap Barney at five times, whenever he chooses. We also get to see Lily act in a terrible play and Barney respond with his own terrible one man show about a robot finding love with a toaster. Robin's past as a pop star in Canada comes back to haunt her! Ted after Lily comes to work with him temporarily finally gets the guts to show off his better architecture design to his boss and has lots of issues with leadership at work throughout the season. Barney meets his match in a cougar played by Jane Seymour. And of course with a wedding on the way there are plenty of memorable moments to be had at a bridal shower, bachelor party, the wedding, and Marshall saying goodbye to the end of an era -- his Fiero car that breaks down before hitting 200,000 miles and all the defining moments that car created. And the gang isn't able to watch the Super Bowl live and frantically try to avoid finding out any news about the outcome so they can watch it recorded together.

The show has eased into a comfortable place where you can enjoy the characters after Marshall undergoes suffering and then Lily is made to pay until the two can gradually reconcile. You know already Robin isn't the mother so it's just a waiting game for her and Ted to break it off. Bob Saget is an excellent narrator! Definitely check this show out, I'm sold on it now. The wedding was sooo sweet! And you know I don't like too much touchy feely stuff.

Bonus Features:

There is a seven minute gag reel, the funniest moments of which involve several ""almost"" kisses between random cast members. ""How I Made Your Mother"" ended up being a pretty great making of showing rehearsals all the way to final cuts through the episode. What made it great was it turns out in that episode where there was a proposal, it was REAL. It was set up for these two fans of the show who knew the makers were put in the background as extras and the proposal was written into the scene and the woman getting proposed to didn't know it so it was a genuine reaction! How cool is that? Did NOT know!",1296345600,,2746,4.388998035363458

2907448,5,B000TM1CKQ,"much much love for HIMYM.  Season 2 was a completely great follow-up to Season 1 as you get to know the characters more.  Yes Ted is sometimes a complete socially awkward moron, Marshmallow/Lilypad are disgustingly adorablely lovey-dovey, Barney is a patronizing womanizer and Robin is Canadian, but each character gets more dimensions added in Season 2.

It's absolutely hilarious and I've pretty much kept Season 2 on constant replay since getting it and I'm still not sick of it.  What's that? Self five? Nice! We out!",1293494400,,521,5.023255813953488

2907455,4,B000TM1CKQ,"Every winter during the holiday hiatus when there are no new episodes being broadcast of any of my shows, I always try to knock off two or three shows that I've not seen but have had some curiosity about.  Now, I detest sitcoms.  Hate, hate, hate!  I loathe laugh tracks.  I consider them toxic and vile and completely destructive.  And in most cases I hate how stilted the sets are and how unimaginative the camera work is (no sitcom in the history of TV has had interesting camerawork, and I say that even though Karl Freund, one of the great geniuses in the history of cinematography, directed many episodes of I LOVE LUCY).  I watch a lot of TV, but I avoid sitcoms like I avoid infectious diseases.  I love comedy, mind you.  I love 30 ROCK, PARTY DOWN, THE OFFICE, and MODERN FAMILY, all of them comedies and none of them sitcoms, and all among my favorite shows.

So why did I try HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER?  Mainly it was because I'd seen a number of TV critics who stated that it was a good show despite being a sitcom.  Part of it was Alyson Hannigan.  BUFFY is my all time favorite show and if you love BUFFY you love Willow.  Interestingly, I don't know a single person who watches the show (at least to my knowledge) and I pretty much decided to give it a shot despite the whole sitcom thing.  Surprisingly, I liked it.  A lot.  Not as much as 30 ROCK and PARTY DOWN and THE OFFICE and definitely not MODERN FAMILY (which might be the best new comedy since ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT), but it was still quite good, with an enormously likable small group of characters.  The laugh track is indeed irritating and, of course, completely unnecessary.  And what is more, it isn't a pure sitcom.  It does a surprising amount out-of-the-studio shooting (though on what anyone who is a serious fan of TV will recognize as the Warner Brothers urban lot, which has been used in hundreds of movies and TV series).  The street shots are on the precise same sets that were used for Metropolis in THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK and New Haven in THE GILMORE GIRLS and the area around the Pie Hole in PUSHING DAISIES.  Plus there are a surprising number of green screen shots.  So the show avoids the static feel that most three camera sitcoms have.  It isn't visually interesting, though it is less bland than, say, TWO AND A HALF MEN.  There are all kinds of ways that the show breaks established rules in minor ways.

Despite the somewhat static visual dimension of the show and the nauseating laugh track, this is a pretty decent show and now that I'm caught up all the way through the first half of Season Five, I fully plan on continuing to watch in the future.  The two things that make the show work for me are the cast and the writing, which despite the well traveled genre.  I like that the cast consists of two unknowns (Josh Radnor and Cobie Smulders)at least at the start) to go with three well known actors (Hannigan, Neil Patrick Harris, and Jason Segal).  I love all five characters and they are all sensational individually but also tremendous as an ensemble.  And the writers manage to keep their stories interesting and ever new by a string of fascinating developments.  I am especially impressed by Neil Patrick Harris, who probably had his career set back by a decade by his Doogie Howser days.  (Which reminds me that another reason I took up the show was because of how much I enjoyed Harris in the title role of DR. HORRIBLE.)

I'm still not a big fan of sitcoms and I doubt if I'll be adding many to my viewing roster in the future, but this is the big exception.  I think the show would have been greatly improved if they had tweaked it only slightly.  I know they have tied the show to stage sets to keep the budget down.  And the format means that the lack of visual experimentation means short set ups and keeps costs down.  The point is, I detest the genre, but I still like HIMYM.

If you thought that line was corny, you need to watch this show because the actor who delivers it (Neal Patrick Harris) is at his best and corniest in this AWESOME show delivering lines you never thought could be passed off on a TV show. But this is by no means a one-man act....the whole main cast is absolutely funny and you are always amused, entertained, and intrigued by the silly and yet-so-new-york-like-life. And viewers always come back for more, not just for the humor and the story line but after all, don't we all want to know how Ted Mosby met the mother of his children? If you liked FRIENDs and SEINFELD, then you are going to absolutely LOVE this show!!!",1247270400,,825,4.689655172413793
2907461,4,B000TM1CKQ,"""How I Met Your Mother"" is my favorite sit-com on the air today. I grew up watching the latter-half of FRIENDS (and have since seen every episode on DVD) and I may go so far as to say, at least for me, How I Met Your Mother is FRIENDS for the Millenial generation.

Season Two improves on the winning formula of the first season. The use of flashbacks as a storytelling device is done with incredible ingenuity (the season finale is a prime example). Other episodes are dedicated to character development, such as the one about Marshall's car turning 200K miles or the episode ""Robin Sparkles"".

As far as the story goes, I won't spoil it all but suffice to say the major arcs of this season are, 1) Marshall and Lily getting back together and getting married in the finale, 2) Robin and Ted being in a relationship, and 3) Ted getting some new responsibilities at work. The actual meta-arc of finding out who Ted eventually marries is more-or-less put on the back-burner this season since the entire season he is dating Robin, whom we know is not the mother of his children (from the pilot episode).

The 'Making-Of' featurette is quite interesting, as are the episode commentaries. The Gag Reel is okay, some of the additional scenes are hilarious (such as an extended version of Barney's Top 10 list from ""Moving Day""), but the ""Hey Beautiful"" music video was quite stupid (in my opinion). The Robin Sparkles video was worth a second viewing in its entirety. It doesn't quite compare to Barney's hippie video from Season One, but it's close.

Overall I was really happy with this purchase, having getting started on this show watching a few live episodes this past spring (end of Season Four) and renting Season One. It didn't hurt that I got it on sale at Target (sorry Amazon!) for $18.",1245196800,,1791,4.640378548895899
2907462,5,B000TM1CKQ,You need to buy the series of this tv show. It is the funniest show I have seen in a while. It's a mix of Friends and Cheers in todays setting!!! It's the greatest tv show in a long time!,1241654400,,187,3.7
2907463,4,B000TM1CKQ,"I pretty much avoided CBS sitcoms. Scrubs, Arrested Development, 30 Rock, that's what I liked. They seemed all non-typical and when looking at the string of Monday night shows on CBS they appeared to be so pedestrian. I realize that might make me sound like a jerk, but that's fine. I might be a jerk.

I had been prodded by several groups of friends for a long time to watch How I Met Your Mother. ""You should watch"" was usually followed by, ""You're exactly like Barney."" Barney is played by Neil Patrick Harris, and while I appreciate being compared to TV royalty like His Doogie-ness, I still wasn't buying it.

With a string of fantastically funny movies turned in by Jason Segel and a rekindled love affair with Freaks and Geeks, I thought ""Why not? If I don't like it, I can blame my friends for years to come.""

So, I purchased season one. It took several episodes to hone in on the pace of the show. It seemed very set-up-set-up-joke-laugh-track, exactly what I don't like. The main character, Ted, was very Ross Gellar-ish, which is to say whiny and annoying. However, not so distasteful that I immediately ejected the disc and burned in the microwave.

It was good to see Alyson Hannigan emerge from Buffy into a more widely palatable show. She deserved it. And Cobie Smulders was attractive enough to pique my interest. I think she even had lines at some point.

Once the show was set, around episode four or five and it was a fully baked How I Met Your Mother pie, I started to enjoy it. I caught myself laughing. It is pleasant and harmless, good humored and endearing. It out friended Friends. Ted's march toward true love was accessible and his hope kindled a small flame in my long-dead, cold heart. I liked it. Season one was quickly followed by purchases of two and three and being stuck wringing my hands waiting on season four.

Though, the comparisons to Barney started to sting. He's a jerk. Oh wait, I'm a jerk. Yet, he's a womanizer and a cad. I'm not that. I might like to be, but I'm not. Is that what my friends thought of me? In later episodes and later seasons they peel back the curtain on Barney. I breathed a sigh of relief. My friends didn't hate me. He's a truer person than that. He cares about his friends, but will rarely show it. OK, I'll accept that. I could be that guy.

And that's how I met How I Met Your Mother.",1240963200,,2355,4.4375

It can be funny and have moments of silent curiosity... And what I mean by that is when they talk about the never seen but always talked about 'mother', you can't help but wonder who she is.

With excellent actors/actresses, well written scripts and just an incredible energy throughout each episode.  How I Met Your Mother is something that all should watch.  It makes me feel good that there are shows out there that bring it each and every episode.

2907489,4,B000TM1CKQ,"SPOILERS alert...especially IF you haven't seen the first season.

So this is Season 2 of HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, and, thank the almighty chewtoy, they haven't let up on the funny. For me, the first season snuck up, although it didn't take too long before it became my current top sitcom. What sold me was the combination of great character dynamics, the off-beat, sometimes snarky humor, and that whiff of romance (that dude Ted can carry a hell of a torch). This gang were folks I could relate to - yes, even Barney, the unapologetically self-absorbed misogynist who still somehow wormed into my good graces. And, actually, even Barney came thru for his buds when the chips were down.

The premise of HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER states that Ted, sometime in the future, will meet the woman of his dreams. In Season 2 Bob Saget returns to reprise his voice-over role of future Ted as he persists in regaling his kids with the convoluted story of how he met their mother. What the show tantalizingly fails to reveal is the mom's identity, and the how and the when. And Season 2 keeps us in suspense. Starting with last season's finale and leading into the Season 2 opener, things have changed some. Lily and likable goof Marshall are no longer engaged, and Marshall is extremely resentful. But Ted and Robin are now an item. Barney, though, is still a raging womanizer. This status quo would remain for several episodes. The show makes no bones about Robin not being the mother of future Ted's kids, so, it was a fun yet bittersweet time watching Robin and Ted go thru the ups and downs of their romance.

In a very good sophomore season, most of the episodes are solid and several sparkle. ""Slap Bet"" (my favorite, and, it seems, everyone else's) dredges up something embarassing from Robin's past, as well as introduces a wagering system paid up in vicious slaps. ""Ted Mosby, Architect"" focuses on Robin's disdain for Ted's vocational small talk and on Barney handing Ted a great pick-up line, which he then runs away with. In ""Swarley"" Barney, to his dismay, is saddled with a nickname (for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0000AQS0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly - The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;fans, Morena Baccarin guest stars as Marshall's crazy-eyed date). Finally, ""Showdown"" has Barney competing in The Price Is Right and meeting his dad, Bob Barker.

Pretty good special features here: The gag reel is definitely worth checking out; there's the 17-minute-long ""How We Make Your Mother"" segment in which key scenes are shown in read thrus, in rehearsal, and, finally, in the actual shooting (this one showcases a truly awesome moment for two of the extras); commentaries on 7 episodes (""Where Were We,"" ""Swarley,"" ""Slap Bet,"" ""Single Stamina,"" ""Arrivederci Fiero,"" ""Bachelor Party,"" and ""Showdown""); additional scenes for ""Moving Day"" (more of Barney's Top Ten list, hilarious!), ""Showdown"" (Barney's Best Man speech), and ""Bachelor Party"" (extra footage of the adult entertainer, but it's not all that); the wonderfully cheesy Robin Sparkles video in its entirety; and the weird ""Hey Beautiful"" video, which contains the show's hummable theme tune (I say ""weird"" because the video borrows clips from the show and then superimposes lips singing the song lyrics over the mouths of the show's characters).

HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER is a well-constructed show and effortlessly navigates a spectrum of tones, from madcap to poignant, from romantic to subversive. The likable cast maintains its comfy chemistry, although the go-to guy for laughs remains the pitch perfect Neil Patrick Harris and his outrageously weasely character Barney. If nothing else, Barney's certainly introduced into the sitcom lexicon phrases such as ""Suit up"" and ""Awesome!"" Oh, and one more. With some help from Wayne Brady and a cameo by former Dallas Cowboy running back Emmett Smith, HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER Season 2 is funny and warm and unpredictable, not to mention, simply legen - wait for it! - dary.",1201996800,5,4056,5.148710166919575

2907507,5,B000TM1CKQ,"Where do they even come up with some of these jokes?  ""Slap Bet"" could rank as one of the most hilarious and creatively written episodes of all time.  Without giving anything away, several other episodes have nearly unlimited replay value at my house.  Many of the jokes appeal to a younger audience, but I think anyone can appreciate what's happening here.

The cast is amazing -- each character has their own unique qualities that make it a lot like Seinfeld's cast.  They do a great job of developing each character, but they never take the focus off the main goal of making people laugh.  I can't get enough of this show and I've never made an easier decision on whether or not to buy the DVD box set.

It's a wildly underrated show, even in its third season.  It's unlike other sitcoms in the fact that the jokes are genuinely good and the writing never makes you cringe.  I can't wait to see ""how they meet the mother"".  If you love comedies, do yourself a favor and watch at least one episode -- you won't be disappointed!",1194480000,2,1029,4.454545454545454
2907508,5,B000TM1CKQ,"Legen...wait for it.....ddary!  this is one of the best sitcom I'll ever see, is funny, not too corny, there is a lot of forced situations...but it's just fun to watch. Even for someone living in the US (that can watch it on TV, because not even cable has it here where I live) is a good DVD collection to have",1193875200,3,310,4.166666666666667
2907509,5,B000TM1CKQ,"This is a great show with very funny moments. The characters are the kind of people you wish you could hang out with every day. Neil Patrick Harris is fantastic, such a funny character. Swarles Barkley Rules. Check it out and SUIT UP!",1193875200,2,234,4.465116279069767

2907511,5,B000TM1CKQ,"this show is absolutely hilarious.  it depicts the lives of 5 late 20-something individuals and how they interact as unconditional best friends as well as people searching for love.  the humor is legendary, the plots original, and if you want to laugh for 30 minutes straight, watch an episode.  i guarantee you'll hook your friends on this series, and you will all be quoting or referencing this show, because our lives today are very similar.  if you have only 1 show to choose for your viewing pleasure, this is the one!  buy how i met your mother today!",1193788800,3,557,4.642857142857143

2907517,5,B000TM1CKQ,"Note: This review contains Spoilers.  I have to admit, I was a little concerned when the second season began.  I mean, having Marshall and Lily break up was kind of a downer.  But I'm glad I decided to keep watching, because this year easily contains some of the show's funniest episodes.  My wife and I put on ""Slap Bet"" anytime we need a little pick-me-up.  And of course, there's the ""Robin Sparkles"" episode, in which Cobie Smulders (like the show itself, a criminally-underrated comic actress) really gets a chance to shine.  ""Swarley"" is a Barney Stinson classic.  And ""Arrivederci, Fiero"" may be the biggest laugh-getter of the season.

How I Met Your Mother may never quite achieve Classic Sitcom status.  And you know, that's really fine with me.  I wouldn't want too much success to go to their heads.  But I'll keep watching and laughing myself silly.",1189036800,11,862,4.795918367346939
2907518,5,B000TM1CKQ,"I can't agree more with the other reviews I've seen - I honestly think this is the funniest show to be on TV in a long time.  All 5 of the actors are hilarious, and they fit together so well.  I don't think I can single any one of them out because they are all SO funny.  I wasn't sure how they could top the first season, but they did.  I was watching the episode ""Arrivederci, Fiero"" at the gym when it aired and could NOT stop laughing out loud (which was somewhat embarrassing...).  Even the episodes that I don't consider my ""favorites"" get me laughing out loud, which for me is rare when I'm watching TV.  This is a fabulous season with some of the best HIMYM moments.  I can't wait to get the DVD and watch the special features!",1188691200,4,735,4.170212765957447
