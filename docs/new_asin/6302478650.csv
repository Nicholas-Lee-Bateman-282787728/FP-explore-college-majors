7827374,1,6302478650,There are only 2 segments in this tape.  The first concerns another person creating a French Braid (using the Dutch Braid method) on a model's blond hair.  The other section shows another person braiding her own hair.  Save your money.  My tape squeaked all the way through.  There weren't enough angles used in filming the braiding process.  Would suggest BRAIDING BEAUTIFUL - also available at Amazon.com as a far better choice.  For a truly gorgeous braiding video BEGINNING HAIR BRAIDING taught by Karen Ribble is tops -- if Amazon can get it. I've been braiding my waist length hair for over 30 years -- and was very disappointed with this tape.,1070236800,,650,4.801801801801802
