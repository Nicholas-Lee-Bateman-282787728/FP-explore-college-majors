1451699,4,B00005JKHF,"As long ago as 1972, I saw this movie in its truncated 125 minute form at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood.  So it was cut very early into its release.  Billy Wilder claimed he had final cut and did the editing himself, so it is curious that he did not keep an uncut copy of the movie or negative.
That said, the 125 minute VHS version--even better letterboxed on Turner Classics--has a seamless continuity, wonderful Miklos Rozsa music, terrific actors, and a great story--using the pursuit of the Loch Ness monster in Scotland as an excuse to explore a melancholy romantic relationship between Holmes and a mystery woman.  It's another neglected Billy Wilder masterpiece, more light and romantic than his 1940's work and with a haunting sad ending.  Highly recommended even cut while we hopefully wait for the 200 minute version.  I'd almost settle for a 125 minute print with restored color and letterboxing.  And stereo for the unforgettable score.

1451793,5,B00005JKHF,"I loved this movie when I first saw it over forty years ago. In several respects, it stands alone among Holmes films. After all, you get both Queen Victoria and the Loch Ness Monster. Thanks to Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond, it's at times hilarious and at times  heartbreaking, a case that Holmes wishes forgotten, the one that ultimately sends him back to the cocaine needle.

The performances are uniformly outstanding, Robert Stephens as Holmes, Colin Blakely as Watson, Christopher Lee as brother Mycroft and Genevieve Page as the doomed Gabrielle Valladon. The search for her missing engineer husband leads to Scotland, groups of midgets, wandring monks and the fabled monster of the Loch. It all culminates in pre-World War I naval intrigue in which all the clues fit, although Holmes is for once at a nearly complete loss.

In a subplot, there's a wonderful twist on the George Bernard Shaw story of a great beauty who wanted to concieve a child with Shaw to combine her beauty with his intelligence. Shaw declined the offer fearing they'd produce a child with his beauty and her intelligence. In this case, Holmes allows it to be believed that he and Watson are gay lovers.

Overall, it's a witty and wonderful homage to the spirit of the Conan Doyle stories for The Strand magazine as well as a unique varient, in many respects the best Holmes film ever made (even in its heavily-edited studio release).",1400284800,3,1411,4.818181818181818
1451794,5,B00005JKHF,"It's always been one of my favorite ""alternate Holmes"" movies.

1451796,3,B00005JKHF,"This is not top notch Billy Wilder, in my opinion. While witty in some places, it's not particularly suspenseful. The actor portraying Sherlock Holmes is quite good. The actor portraying Watson is funny, but that's all. He mostly plays the character for laughs, and is not believable as a doctor.  There is a pretty funny, if un-PC scene set on stage in a theater worth seeing.

Not only does the film drag in places, but it's clear that the film was originally intended to be longer, presented episodically. This user idea is presented in the expository part of the film, but the film ends without going further.

A decently enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.

Transfer is okay, not great, if not a bit on the dark side.",1396051200,,728,4.576923076923077
1451817,4,B00005JKHF,"Prior to season three of the ""Sherlock"" series, PBS featured a couple summaries of the original Sherlock Holmes novels by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and one of them mentioned what I call ""the Sherlock Holmes Apocrypha,"" i.e. Sherlock Holmes stories produced by other writers.  The Basil Rathbone films are appreciated by most  ""Sherlockians,"" while others have received mixed reviews.  ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" was mentioned as being on the ""approved"" list of Holmes fans, but I'd never heard of it -- which is my fault because I don't get out much.  Since I was ordering ""the Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries"" and season
one of ""Sherlock,"" I decided to include this one.  The outdoor scenes filmed in and around Inverness, Scotland, are by themselves well worth the experience --- seeing as how I've personally visited the area a few times.  On the other hand, the portrayal of Queen Victoria seemed straight out of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus.""  The business re. the cocaine occurs quite briefly in the Doyle originals, and too many of the spinoffs have made a big deal out of it.  The movie would have worked better without it.",1393459200,,1137,4.885416666666667
1451818,4,B00005JKHF,"I love anything about Sherlock Holmes, and I really liked this movie. Robert Stephens (now deceased - he was Maggie Smith's ex-husband as well as father of the actor Toby Stephens - Toby is a carbon copy of his dad!) plays a brave and very intelligent Sherlock. His Holmes appeared to me to be rather effeminate ... or maybe that was his stage makeup? Or perhaps they wanted him to appear gay?

I wish the storyline had done more with the ballerina wanting to parent a child with Sherlock. The scene where they are all in Scotland and Mycroft is explaning the H.M.S. Jonah seemed to be very dragging for me. However, the bits with the undercover Trappist monks and Ilse using her parasol as a ""signalling device"" were very clever.

This movie portrays Sherlock as a complicated human - his sexuality, flaws, and yet he's a man, not a machine. At the end he appears sadly moved (**spoiler**) by the news of Ilse's death. The movie closes with Watson (played by Colin Blakely) writing away at his memoirs. Stephens and Blakely make a great team as the consulting detective and his biographer.",1386028800,,1090,4.642487046632124

1451820,5,B00005JKHF,Watson is adorable in being clueless and Holmes is just Holmes. Sherlock is a bit more humorous in this film than I have seen in others so that was a plus.

1451822,5,B00005JKHF,"The Private life of Sherlock Holmes is an outstanding film on all levels.  The script is an adult sophisticated comedy, erudite and witty, but never falling to the level of farce.  A lot of this, of course, is due to the superb writing of Billy Wilder and I A L Diamond.

This is one of those films that captivates from the first moment - one's eyes never leave the screen for fear of missing some action or some great performance.  And what performances there are too!  From good old Stanley Holloway as a gravedigger to Irene Handl as Holmes' and Watson's landlady, to Clive Revill as the Director of the Russian Imperial Ballet to Tamara Toumanova as the prima ballerina - all uniformly good and a delight to watch.  The fun begins when one realizes that Toumanova has chosen Holmes (out of dozens of well-known gentlemen, including Tchaikovsky and Nietzsche) to sire a child for her!

Robert Stephens as Sherlock Holmes gives, arguably, the best performance of his career.  I would even dare say that in my humble opinion, Stephens is the best interpreter of Holmes on screen - his portrayal is that of a sensitive man, intelligent, charming and cunning, but with vulnerability about him that makes Holmes so human and not the cardboard cutout that the portrayal sometimes proves to be.

Colin Blakely as Watson is simply hilarious - he throws himself so completely into the part and with such vigor that you fall in love (yes, love) with Watson from his first scene.  If we could all have such a ""Watson"" in our lives!

Genevieve Page, as the female lead, is a lesson in good acting and becomes one with the character.  There's a wonderful chemistry between Page and Stephens that makes these characters so human and accessible.  The always-impressive Christopher Lee turns in another wonderful performance as Mycroft Holmes - witty and intense at the same time.  It is fun to watch Sherlock and Mycroft together - not too dissimilar, but rather like bookends!

Homage must be paid to the inimitable Billy Wilder, the director, who always seems to add a bit of whipped-cream to everything he touches - even his most dramatic films.  Nothing seems amiss in this film; the continuity is certainly among the top I have seen in 50 years of film viewing.  I credit Wilder with keeping things moving and in the most charming manner.

One thing that should be addressed and is little spoken of is the look of the film - it's the beautiful, soft look of an old cabinet card - a perfect evocation of the 1890s.  The color photography is gorgeous - thank God this film was made before everything got dark and we lost all of our beautiful color to the grim and gritty world of today's Hollywood!  This is a film you will want to view over and over, and in deference to Billy Wilder, I must add that it is the rare Wilder film that I cannot watch over and over and continually be delighted with!",1377388800,,2888,4.614481409001957
1451823,4,B00005JKHF,"Assuming the version being shown on PBS in NYC right now is this same one, as others have commented the color is indeed faded. Not beyond hope, but a typical not particularly well preserved 1970 era color print. Definitely not digitally restored, unfortunately. Definitely not three-strip Technicolor where they went back to the original negatives. It sort of looks like a fairly well done colorized version of a black and white film. (Remember those?) Not scratched or flaking except a bit of white dots at one or two points. You can improve it with some video adjustments, but you can never make something out of nothing.

I've seen various comments about the acting here and at IMDB. I'd say everyone is fine, including the sometimes derided Gabrielle Valladon. Except for Colin Blakely, who goes for a bit too much olde English mugging. Back at this time in general there wasn't always quite the expectation we have for scripts and acting to be quite entirely believeable in this sort of thing. For example, Watson is written as being honestly shocked and appalled about Holmes apparently being gay, after living with him for five years. Deep, deep in the closet, or maybe just an elaborate ruse for no reason I suppose. And of course the music is maybe more heavy handed and melodramatic than would be done today either. So anyway I don't have quite the same expectations for the acting either, particularly in a script set around 1880 which to a degree is mocking various sorts of Britishness. But Blakely just goes consistently a little too broad, and sometimes way too broad.

Still, like a lot of people are saying, pretty good film despite some slight shortcomings if you like this sort of thing. It would certainly be nice if the missing footage were to be dug up and the original cut restored, if there even is an assembled version or footage and editing documentation in existence somewhere. And digitally restored too.",1376697600,,1932,4.833836858006042
1451824,4,B00005JKHF,"First, the watchable part. It's a fair mystery, with a bumbiling Watson, a Mycroft decidedly on the gray side (not light or dark, actually, but could go either way), and a Sherlock with at least his share of human foibles. Ennui among them - when assailed by under-excitement, he retreats to his 7% solution (watered down to 5%, by the friend looking out for his health).

But, since this artifact comes down to us from the 1970s, Cold War angst underlies the major plot. Super-weapon, German (East German?) spy, layers of intelligence agencies - and all that wrapped around a story that might have dated from the early inklings of WWI. But, the era adds more to the layered anachronisms. A strong leading lady reminds us that Women's Lib emerged in the 1970s (and echoed the suffragettes leading up to the 1920s). Even more, though, early parts of the movie offer a subversive kind of acceptance of gays. It's kind of a ""don't ask don't tell, but you know and we know"" sort of acceptance, but a thin edge of a wedge nevertheless. Maybe the 1970s foretold the 2000-era social change, and maybe they echoed experimental social conventions of the 1920s.

A good story in itself, and worth seeing for that reason. But, if you want a melange of social norms chosen from many decades (and possibly decades in this movie's future), the subtext is well worth reading.

1451825,5,B00005JKHF,"Long before the wonderful Jonny Lee Miller embodied Holmes on ""Elementary,"" director Billy Wilder chose to lend his considerable comic (and cynical) talents to his own account of the brilliant Holmes and his bumbling but dedicated sidekick Watson. The results are wonderful for the serious film fan, but less so for Wilder. The film, which was meant to be a three-hour, reserved-seat-type roadshow, was dramatically edited by the studio, and several sequences were deleted in entirety. Because the scenes were separate Holmes cases, unrelated to the main plot, the final product does not suffer in any way, and perhaps it is a better, tighter film for the editing. The ""remains"" of the deleted scenes are included on the DVD, so you can view them for yourself. The film was hastily released in neighborhood theaters in its truncated form, and although many critics liked it, it disappeared all too quickly. Many years passed before the film, as part of Wilder's amazing body of work, was finally rediscovered and given its due.

But back to the film itself, a witty, cheeky, cynical and ultimately, a surprisingly romantic film which culminates in one of Holmes' most complex cases involving spies, a mysterious Frenchwoman, a submarine and even Queen Victoria. The late Robert Stephens (former spouse and co-satr of Maggie Smith) is the perfect Holmes, laconic, brilliant, bored, and almost always right, and Colin Blakeley is just the right foil as Watson. And Genevieve Page is quite wonderful and sexy as the enigmatic woman in the case. The production design is stunning, and Miklos Rosza's score, highlighted by his incredible violin concerto, is one of the best film scores Rosza ever composed (and that's saying a lot).

This film desperately needs a blu-ray version, to clean up its quality and make certain it is being seen in all its cinematic glory. But for the moment, the MGM disc is the best we have, and we can only hope that Criterion will one day give it the TLC it deserves.",1367798400,2,1993,4.946268656716418

1451866,2,B00005JKHF,"This movie compares poorly to every other film and television adaptation of the Holmes stories I've ever seen. The most significant problem is the depiction of Dr. Watson as a buffoon; the Holmes canon has entertained readers for decades in part because Watson serves as a good stand-in for the audience, asking the questions we would want to ask, considering the evidence we would consider, and so forth. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/recent-BBC-reboot-of-the-Holmes-stories/dp/B004132HZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">recent BBC reboot of the Holmes stories</a>&nbsp;captures this very well, with Martin Freeman as Watson reacting to Holmes and Holmes' fame in a way that humanizes the detective, allowing him to be as freakishly obsessive and anti-social as the plot requires without making him unsympathetic. ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" fails to do this. Watson is portrayed as a fool with no self-awareness, leaving Holmes to carry all the weight of being both an incomparable super-genius and providing the only recognizably realistic human behavior on the screen. The imbalance skews every scene Watson is in, often to the point of being cringe-worthy.

The script calls for some humor, much of which is dated and lame. In the opening sketch, virtually all the humor comes from Holmes pretending that he and Watson are gay lovers, thus drawing a group of male ballet dancers to show interest in Watson and breaking the hearts of the ballerinas (because, naturally, all male ballet dancers are gay, and all gay men would find a portly middle-aged Englishman to be irresistible. No other people in the movie comment on Watson's apparent irresistibility, so the fascination of the ballerinas is the greatest mystery in the plot of the whole film). There is no subtlety in this sketch; it is played very broadly. The script relies on the audiences finding homosexuality to be inherently funny, and maybe people thought it was in 1970, but from the perspective of 2013, the whole thing comes across as faintly desperate.

That sketch complete, we move to the main mystery, which seems to have been lifted from an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo/dp/B0001CNQVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo</a>&nbsp;(I joke, but the cartoon hit the airwaves in 1969, a year before this movie was released, so it may even be possible). Ignoring some of the improbabilities in the story, we eventually reach its comic set piece -- a bizarre visit by Queen Victoria to the site where England's first submarine is to be launched. She had apparently never been briefed on why she was being asked to visit this remote location and is appalled to discover that the submarine is intended to be used in warfare, rather than to look at fish. She demands the boat be scuttled. The entire encounter is intended for humor, but for me it was bizarre and unfunny.

Christopher Lee was fine as Mycroft Holmes. Otherwise, there is nothing here worth seeing.",1357689600,4,3053,5.477707006369426
1451867,5,B00005JKHF,"I used to own this on VHS, but my machine quit working. So I checked Amazon and found it on DVD. I would recommend this movie to any avid Sherlock Holmes fan. And I would buy from this seller again.",1357516800,,198,3.975
1451868,5,B00005JKHF,Billy Wilder had a wonderful vision for his original production - so much was lost - but what is left just shines - The best Sherlock Holmes film ever,1357171200,,150,4.206896551724138
1451869,4,B00005JKHF,"This is fun. It wouldn't be if it had strayed too far from the Holmes persona or if it were not a good movie. Holmes is a favorite from childhood, and odd takeoffs on him are not appreciated. I have settled on the Jeremy Brett series as the definitive version (with an authentic Watson), but enjoy others that are well done. Usually, if you like the subject matter, you will probably like a good adaptation, if a bit more inventive than the source material. Another Holmes based example of that would be ""The Seven Percent Solution,"" which I thought was well done and true to character.  I haven't seen a lot of Robert Stephens, but have appreciated what I have. I looked him up and found that this was pretty light fare for his experience. His is a quality portrayal and really, so are most.

However, the Dr. Watson persona mystifies, that here and in other handling, they make him something of a buffoon. That's not the author's character, nor what Holmes' temperament would seem to tolerate as a companion or assistant. Maybe it came from the early Rathbone series with Nigel Bruce's inaccurate portrayal of Watson as a bumbler. Whether intentional or not, the movies frequently present him as comic relief. The real Watson was an established medical practitioner, war veteran, gentlemanly, a man of disciplined habits and sobriety, who actually served as a steadying influence to Holmes on occasion. His counter posing traits and abilities served as assets to Holmes, such as his use of fire arms, medical knowledge, leg man and sensitivity to persons and situations where Holmes was limited or devoid - not a bizarre personality.  There was enough of that element in the storylines to satisfy that requirement.  By the way, his assistantship and housemate status ended upon his marriage.

But, this overall production is pleasing and one that keeps Holmes' basic makeup well intact.",1351468800,,1888,4.8875
1451870,2,B00005JKHF,"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, 1970 film

The copyright for Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional characters expired before this film was produced so anyone can appropriate his characters today. None who do this are as good as the original four long stories and fifty-six short stories (which reflect life in those passed times). This parody is not as good as the low-budget movies of the 1930s and 1940s. The part spent at the opera can be omitted without affecting the rest of this story. It applies an outlook that did not exist then, and denies these stories about the beginnings of criminalistics and their effect upon later fiction. We know people in show business do not lead normal lives. Those who pretend to be characters on stage may suffer psychic damage and seek drink or drugs in relief. The first false note is showing a dusty manuscript. If it was kept in a sealed box where did that dust come from?

In August 1887 Holmes and Watson return to London. There is some comic situations. Holmes complains about a lack of action (and fees), and reaches for his small bottle. They receive an invitation to an opera; this is followed by some ""funny"" skits. It does show how gossip is spread by the expressions on faces. People believe what they want to believe when it belittles someone else. That is the appeal of gossip. [""Thou shalt not bear false witness.""] ""Goodnight, Watson."" The doorbell rings, a young lady is brought in. They accept delivery of this package. ""I don't know."" Who is Gabrielle? Holmes traced her luggage ticket and found her name and valise. Her husband is missing! Holmes sends a letter to 32 Ashdown Street, an empty shop. Who will take the letter? Who is buying a dozen canaries? Mycroft tells Sherlock to drop his investigation. [Official Secrets?] Holmes has a plan to drop any tail. Why does Gabrielle open her parasol indoors? [Bad luck?] They travel to Inverness in Scotland. A picnic in a cemetery? Did Watson see a monster in a lake? There are mysterious events. What are Trappist monks doing in Protestant Scotland? They travel around the country lanes on bicycles. [The great bicycle craze of the 1880s inspired the invention of the automobile.] They visit a castle undergoing restoration; it is closed to the public.

On the lake Holmes hears the rattle of machinery. [Sound carries farther in water.] Their boat is upset, yet they all survive in that cold water. Holmes speculates about a mechanical monster. Where will they go next? Mycroft visits Sherlock and talks about ""submersibles"". Madame Valladon is really an agent of Wilhelmstrasse! [The street in Berlin where the German Secret Service is headquartered.] Queen Victoria arrives after dark to view the `Jonah'. That craft is not sporting and un-English. Would her grandson Willie ever bomb London? [Yes.] This project is cancelled, but Mycroft has a plan to let no crisis go to waste. Fraulein von Hofmann-Stahl is awakened. ""Unter den Schloss?"" She will be useful in a trade. And so the story ends. ""Auf wiedersehn."" Later a letter reaches Sherlock in London with sad news about Ilse. The Kempei-Tai are not easily fooled. Sherlock reaches for his little bottle.

It seems that writers without great talent will try to tear down a fictional character because they cannot produce a better product. There were ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies in the 1930s and 1940s, and a TV series in the 1950s. Tastes and expectations change. Hammett, Gardner, and Chandler were popular in the past but are no longer being published.

Robert Stephens is superb and suitably superior as Holmes. Colin Blakely is a perfect counterpoint as the vaguely boyish enthusiasm of Watson. For me though, it is the delectable Genevieve Page that captures the scenes (see my review of Belle de Joure). She is the temporary amnesic abductee, dumped into Holmes and Watson's collective lap. Canaries and the Scottish Highland capital, Inverness, come into the picture. A gentlemen's club and imperial espionage are woven into the story (co-written by Billy Wilder, the director and producer), along with the beautifully dictioned Christopher Lee, as Holmes' brother, Mycroft.

But I also cannot say I did like it or even that it was okay, so I am stuck in the middle. I chose two stars, because what I do not like about it I dislike much more than I like what I do like.

First of all, I should say that although I like Sherlock Holmes well enough, I never was a big fan. I much prefer other fictional detectives. So the fact that this movie takes great liberties with him, the stories about him, and the other characters in those stories matters to me not at all. My comments relate to the movie as a movie, not to its faithfulness to Doyle's stories.

The problem is that I am gay. If I were straight, I might be in hog heaven watching this movie, with all the squirmy, slimy gay jokes and innuendos, the female nudity and leering thereat, etc. But I AM gay, and I love being gay and am genuinely proud and delighted to be gay, so portraying what I am as something undesirable and shameful does not entertain me.

Robert Stephens is marvelous, as he always was, particularly when he was young; Christopher Lee is a charmer at any age; and Colin Blakely is fine as Watson. I am thinking my problem is Billy Wilder. I have not seen Some Like It Hot in a very long time, but I suspect the comical cross-dressing and the potential horrors implicit in it would bother me now too.

Evidently Wilder was none too fond of homosexuality and other alternate ways of being except as opportunities to leer and squirm and make wisecracks. Too bad. Not for him - he's dead - but for me. I used to like him, but no more.

I can forgive Some Like It Hot because Marilyn is in it, and she is without question the loveliest human being who ever stood before a camera; but she is not in this movie, so down it goes.",1312675200,7,1830,4.172804532577904
1451874,5,B00005JKHF,"When I first saw this film, I stopped watching it during the first scene because I thought that it was silly. However, weeks passed and I tried it again. Once I got passed the first scene, where an aged ballerina tries to persuade Holmes to have sex with her so that she can have a smart child, I found the plot engaging and funny. The film is ostensibly a report on a case that Sherlock mishandled; he did not understand what was happening. Underlying the tale and the first scene is the question of whether Sherlock is gay, as he claimed to avoid hurting the ballerina's feelings.

An attractive woman is carried to Holmes' apartment by a cabbie because he found Holmes' address in the woman's pocket. He said that he found her floating in the water. Although she was at first unable to recall her name, why she wanted to see Holmes, and why she was in the water, her memory returned. She said that she sought Holmes' help in finding her husband, and while coming to see him, someone chloroformed her and tossed her in the Thames.

 Holmes' brother Microft, a government official, orders Sherlock to abandon the case, but Sherlock peruses it. The case develops into an international affair.

1451925,4,B00005JKHF,"If you view this movie expecting yet another Sherlock Holmes tale of intrigue and adventure you may be disappointed. This movie does have its share of intrigue as well, but, as the title indicates, it is not a typical Holmes case. It is much or more about taking a deeper look at Holmes the person.

One thing that's very different about this film is that Holmes develops an attraction to a woman and as a result is blinded to what the clues in this case really mean. This is in deliberate contrast to the beginning of the film where Watson questions whether Holmes is interested in women at all. Watson soon finds himself sidelined when Holmes finds himself strangely attracted to Belgian beauty Gabrielle who is at the core of the case.

If you watch this movie, try to keep an open mind. It is not the typical Holmes film.  This is a deliberately different portrayal and re-examination of the characters. Watson is a bit more of a hot-head than in other films. Sherlock Holmes, it turns out, is a human being after all, and is not always on top of his game. Unlike most Holmes portrayals, there is a satirical edge to this movie.

1451930,5,B00005JKHF,"I've been on Amazon for some years and this is my first comment. This film, though flawed and a bit fragmented, holds firm as a cohesive statement about the character of Sherlock Holmes.  Watson's character attempts to be somewhat of a foil, which keeps this piece in the realm of mystery/adventure, for without him we'd have a romantic thriller.

I had seen this film much earlier and forgotten most of it. Now, I very much appreciate seeing Holmes' emotional foibles and vulnerability.  Even throughout his previous adventures when he forgives a person's crime, Doyle did not allow Sherlock to shed a tear and bat an eye or elude a glance.  This film was immersive on a level rare for Sherlock and I enjoyed it very much. The casting was terrific and spot-on. (I would love to know what Jeremy Brett thought of this production.)

If today's writers are to expand on what Conan Doyle has given us, it is in this private, emotional arena. At the end of this year (2009), a new action film called ""Sherlock Holmes"" will be released, portraying Sherlock as an unshaven cross between James Bond and Batman.  Though great for this era's viewer to see such entertaining thrills, I feel it goes astray from the creator's vision and the purist audience's desires.

Now, after viewing this film, when I read the stories again I can flesh-out Sherlock into much more of a feeling man, who only chooses the coolly analytic so as not to detract from the truth. Now, I can truly imagine what is in his secret heart of hearts.  Bravo.",1247011200,2,1521,4.670411985018727

The thing I like the best about Sherlock Holmes movies is all the little detecting that Sherlock does using minor clues that nobody else notices, but Billy Wilder seems to be scrupulously avoiding this integral part of the Holmes character.

1451934,5,B00005JKHF,"A long-time dream project for Billy Wilder, beginning life as a musical, going through several years of rewrites and casting proposals - at one point even a vehicle for Peter O'Toole and Peter Sellers until the director found both impossible to make a deal with - before going into production as a hugely expensive $10m budgeted three-hour plus roadshow picture only to be cut down to little over two hours when exhibitors refused to book the uncut version, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is something of a legend in itself. The whereabouts of all the elements for a full restoration has long defied the finest minds in film restoration, adding a layer of mystique and what-if? to the film's reputation.

The best way to watch The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is to forget what could have been and marvel at what is left. For all its problems, even in the heavily cut version that was eventually released, this is one of Billy Wilder's greatest and certainly most heartfelt achievements - and a pretty good yarn as well, throwing missing dwarves, dead canaries, Trappist monks, Swan Lake, Sherlock's mysterious brother Mycroft, Queen Victoria and the Loch Ness Monster into the mix, as well as an amnesiac woman who rouses more than Holmes' professional curiosity, to tragic results.

Throughout, Wilder presents a much less self-assured vision of the great detective than had been seen before. In the opening scene he castigates Watson for the expectations the Doctor's stories in Strand Magazine have instilled in the public, and the film proceeds to ultimately explore that painful gap between expectations and reality with no mercy to the character's feelings but much compassion.

Where to Watson's spirit of adventure, all things are possible, to Holmes all things can be disassembled and found wanting. There's real pain, loneliness and despair behind his faade of dry wit. Robert Stephens' Holmes is a genuinely tragic figure, a victim of his own intellect whose descent into becoming a thinking machine is more an act of self-defence at his poor judgement in matters romantic. The final shots of him reaching for a shot of cocaine to hide a broken heart are one of the most haunting images of its era.

Colin Blakely's Watson too is a great creation. He is never mere comic relief or the all-too-familiar buffoonish stereotype but a fully realised figure pained by his inability to deal with his friend's drug use (and discomfort with being his unwitting supplier). There's a humanity, familiarity and genuine emotional interdependence to their partnership that most other screen pairings have missed, aided immensely by some remarkable writing. If there's such a thing as a script so sharp you could cut yourself on it, then parts of this could cause fatal injury. To quote every good line would mean typing out half of the script, and certainly the entire Bolshoi Ballet where Clive Revill's impresario makes an unusual business proposal to Holmes. But it's not all highbrow. Example: ""Who's that at this hour?"" ""Maybe Mrs Hudson is entertaining?"" ""Really? I've never found her so.""

But more than amusing dialogue, this is a film which has been clearly thought through in every detail - at one point, Holmes' is even glimpsed through a haze of smoke as boredom clogs his mind. Even though Wilder's visual imagination is limited, the film is sumptuous to look at, particularly in its proper widescreen ratio, but for many, the major impetus for buying this DVD will be the location of the soundtrack (but not the picture) for the original opening half-hour of the picture (including The Case of the Upside Down Room) and the picture (but not the sound) for The Dreadful Business of the Naked Honeymooners.

The weight of expectation that comes with what has thus far been located of the missing footage is, in truth, more than two of the episodes can bear. The real gem is The Curious Case of the Upside Down Room, less for the case itself but for what it tells us about the relationship between Holmes and Watson, precipitating a crisis that is only resolved by deceit on Holmes' part (Holmes' admission to Watson is very affecting). It's also the only deleted section that seems to serve a real purpose in the film's design. Neither the original opening scene in the train, more of a skit than anything of significance, or The Dreadful Business of the Naked Honeymooners advance the plot or illuminate the characters, being little more than overextended, very mildly amusing sketches.

The supplementary section is also mildly disappointing, not because of the effort put in by the producers of the original laserdisc who collated many of them: again, it's a case of decades of expectation working against it. The laserdisc included an early draft script which was intriguing - apparently almost everything was filmed - but also contained some crudely misplaced elements. Mycroft's line about the last doctor who warned him about his gout falling on an orange peel and breaking his neck originally replaced the fruit with a very unconvincing use of the word 'turd,' while the original addenda to the ending, with Lestrade asking Watson if Holmes will help solve the Jack the Ripper case, seems particularly lame. However, for this DVD release only script and stills montages for the deleted scenes are included.

The stills archive is good, although it is a shame that it limits itself to purely colour shots. However, there is far too little of the pressbook for those who want to know more about the film. For some reason a panned-and-scanned version of the quite brilliant but spoiler-heavy trailer has been used, and a well-worn one at that (note to newcomers to the film: avoid it until you've seen it, as it gives away two major plot twists). A lengthy on-camera interview with editor Ernest Walter is also included, although be warned that he gets one detail wrong (it is indeed Jenny Hanley who played Holmes' university `sweetheart' in a lost flashback sequence), while, exclusive to the DVD, there's also a 15-minute interview with Christopher Lee. The isolated music track of Miklos Rozsa's superb score that was on the laserdisc is NOT included on the DVD (the track was problematic: with the masters long lost, a dubbing mix track was used with the volume varying wildly).

Picture quality is somewhat disappointing, especially compared to the laserdisc - a bit soft and definitely in need of a remastering.",1198886400,14,6441,4.962001853568118

1451959,4,B00005JKHF,"There are many stories about the making of this movie. Some say the final result was far from the great Billy Wilder's vision as the ""evil"" studio heads drove him to tears by chopping up the film to create a shorter, theater-friendly version. Others say Wilder became disenchanted with the film as time went on and the end result proves he just wanted to get it over and done with. Whatever the truth may be, I think fans of the novels and Wilder may find some enjoyment in this. Others may turn it off after the first 20 minutes.

The finished film is really two stories. The first has to do with Wilder attempting to make light of the ""real"" relationship between Holmes and Watson. In 1970, this ""Are they gay?"" storyline was something daring. Today, it is tame and boring. Hence the idea those first 20 minutes may be tough to sit through even if a few laughs are provided along the way. But fortunately the main story kicks into gear and provides what I think is everlasting enjoyment. The characters and mystery all come to vivid life and though, as some have mentioned, the ending may not be for everyone's taste, the ride is an awful lot of fun.

EXTRAS: I found the extras hard to sit through. Christopher Lee is interviewed and does have some tidbits about the shooting of the film but for the most part talks about his previous incarnations of Holmes. There is also an interview with an editor that drones on and on. I tried sitting thru the attempt to rebuild the so called ""lost footage"" using storyboards, pictures, and script lines but alas, after a while I hit the stop button on this as well. I guess it is nice these were included but what I felt was missing was the actual story of what Wilder was really trying to accomplish with this movie. Others may get it, I just did not.

I would say buy this movie if you are a Holmes fan just to see something a bit unusual. Although this film may not completely come together, this  may be an example of a movie where the parts are indeed better than the whole.",1174003200,3,2022,4.398395721925134

1451961,5,B00005JKHF,"In Billy Wilder's melancholy THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES (1970), Robert Stephens is Holmes and Colin Blakely is Dr. Watson.  It is a wonderful creation by Wilder--a mysterious woman (Genevieve Page) calling herself Gabrielle Valledon arrives at 221B Baker Street having pulled out of the Thames.  Obviously not whom she claims to be, which is half the fun here and all of the romance in a very romantic Wilder film, Madame Valledon leads Holmes and Watson by train into the Scottish highlands.  There they will tangle with midget anarchists and seemingly the Loch Ness monster; Queen Victoria makes a memorable cameo.  Oh, and of course there is the 7% cocaine solution never to be found in a Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock Holmes movie.

This is a gorgeously made movie, from the art direction and Panavision cinematography, to a towering score by Miklos Rozsa.  Stephens and Blakely seem born to play Holmes and Watson.  The movie was conceived, in a roadshow movie age, at 200 minutes.  Several mini stories would be like entrees before the Loch Ness monster main course.  But Wilder and editor Ernest Walter sensibly and skillfully pruned the finished movie to a tight 125 minutes with just one ""entree"" before the main action.

The DVD is a ""must own"" for all Sherlock Holmes devotees because of its bonuses--a chat with Christopher Lee, who plays Mycroft Holmes; an in-depth conversation with editor Walter on what the original roadshow movie was really like; and, most of all, a Deleted Scenes section that is at least 90 minutes long, making it longer than the entire cut footage.  In this bonus section MGM Home Entertainment has done a masterful job of re-creating the 200 minute movie with existing footage, production stills, and screenplay pages where nothing else exists.  Missing are the soundtrack of the Case of the Naked Honeymooners---the visual exists and subtitles supply the missing soundtrack.  Production stills and screenplay pages make up a totally extraneous and boring original prologue.  A five minute flashback to Holmes at Oxford is a mixture of existing visual and screenplay pages; it was cut near the end of the movie and missed by me.  And the rather silly Case of the Upside-Down Room has production stills and screenplay pages for footage totally lost.

I'm of the minority opinion that Wilder and Walter created a masterpiece in trimming away the extraneous stories, leaving one intact with Clive Revill and Russian dancers, and focusing entirely on the mystery of Gabrielle Valledon and the Loch Ness monster.  THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES is another Billy Wilder masterpiece. one with a haunting sadness and melancholy romance to make it very special.  And Rozsa's  score is one of his absolute greatest.  Totally neglected in 1970, the movie deserves major rediscovery a quarter of a century later.",1157068800,4,2847,5.068669527896995

1451963,5,B00005JKHF,"This film is sometimes described as a comedy, and while it has humourous bits (a more sardonic and biting form of humour most of the time), it has never really felt at home being classified as a comedy, in my estimation. I do like the rapid-fire wit that Holmes seems to have here (a bit more in abundance than in the canonical Conan Doyle stories), but the Holmes presented here is a bit more dark and brooding, more akin to the extra-canonical 'Seven Percent Solution' Holmes in many ways.

Wilder was an extraordinary director and genius who sometimes gets carried away with his subject (in this regard, he is sometimes compared with Stanley Kubrick). His films are often of epic-proportions, even though they are not essentially 'epic' subjects. This film is reputed to have been nearly twice as long as the final cut version, but this may be apocryphal in that much of the raw footage never made it to final print and production. The restoration available on the disc currently available is, in fact, rather minimal - a few scenes and a few extras, but not much more than the original release of the film. This is disappointing to many fans, but in fact is more than most of us have had for a long time, as the somewhat choppy film was often mercilessly cut for television broadcast.

Holmes in this case is played by Robert Stephens, an unlikely Holmes in comparison to standards such as Rathbone, Brett, or Gillette, but still an interesting choice - quintessentially British, reserved but daring, brilliant yet flawed and faltering. Colin Blakely presents a stronger Watson than often portrayed before (this film, being made in 1970, presented this as a newer idea for Watson, one that has been picked up by many subsequent productions). Wilder has the actors play at various issues of Victorian sensibility and morality, including the implication (dismissed in the end) that Holmes might have a sexual identity issue. Christopher Lee, who himself plays Holmes in other productions, plays Holmes' smarter brother Mycroft here, to good effect.

The story line does have some inspiration from the canonical stories (the Bruce-Partington Plans, for one), and from Gillette's play (the strange case of Miss Faulkner, introducing an ending that allowed for a love interest for Holmes in the end), but for the most part takes the characters from Conan Doyle and runs far afield. Still, this is must-see film for any fan of Holmes, and any fan of Wilder, who saw this as one of his last great productions.",1133136000,8,2506,4.864168618266979

1452015,5,B00005JKHF,"For decades, we fans of ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" have waited for someone to discover the fabled excised scenes, and lo and behold, here they are on the DVD.  And guess what?  They were right to cut them in the first place.  The removal of the three extra scenes in no way hurts the film as it was released in 1970, and only one, ""The Upside-Down Room,"" which delves into the special relationship that exists between Holmes and Watson (not the hints at gayness that are exploited to comic effect in the official version, but the affection and concern Watson holds for his friend), really resonates and could have remained.  The others seem somewhat frivolous.  But with or without them, ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" remains a touching, lovely film.  Robert Stephens is an affecting, if atypical Holmes whose performance was heavily criticized upon the film's initial release, but time has been very kind to it.  Colin Blakely is just wonderful at Watson:  loyal, faithful, but sometimes indignant and frustrated.  The sequence in which he is forced to act as valet to Holmes' ""Mr. Ashdown"" is a gem.  The real scene thief, however, is Christopher Lee as Sherlock's brother Mycroft.  This might be Lee's best performance out of the thousand or so films he's made, one that shows a sense of comedy not always evident in the actor's work.  He also daringly appears without his usual hairpiece (yeah, I know he claims it's a bald cap in the accompanying interview, but c'mon...Lee's hairline is different in every film and sometimes the camera gets close enough to see the lace toupee fronts; besides, he used to claim he shaved his head for the part of Mycroft, and it can't be both).  Special mention has to be given to Miklos Rosza's beautiful, evocative score, particularly the violin concerto that serves as the film's theme.  It might not be the Holmes of tradition; it might not even be the Billy Wilder of tradition; but anyone who can sit through the final shot of ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" without so much as a lump in the throat is colder than Mr. Freeze.",1117584000,5,2095,4.735537190082645
1452016,4,B00005JKHF,"Along with the hard-to-find Hammer film classic A STUDY IN TERROR, Billy Wilder's wonderful revisionist THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES stands as one of the best Sherlock Holmes cinema pastiches.  Apparently this film has also influenced one of the better contemporary Sherlock Holmes revisionists, as Mitch Cullin acknowledged Wilder and co-screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond at the front of his excellent Holmes novel A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND.

Sadly, this film has yet to be seen as it was originally intended by Wilder, with the studio cutting his epic-length director's version almost in half.  That said, there is still much about the shortened movie that holds the viewer's attention, not the lest of which is the quality of the acting and Wilder-Diamond's classic ear for witty dialogue between men.  Robert Stephens plays a hysterically droll Sherlock, and Colin Blakely offers us a Watson who is high strung, shrill, and, perhaps, even more neurotic than Sherlock.  With Holmes sexuality put under the microscope, the Loch Ness monster making a cameo, and a number of plot twists that create the false impression that a much deeper game is afoot, THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES fails to disappoint.  This is clever, funny stuff, with a proper amount of drama thrown in at the appropriate moments.  Sure, there is much here we Sherlockians could take issue with (Christopher Lee playing a very lean and agile Mycroft, for example), but what Wilder brings to the visual Holmes canon is so rich and smart that such flaws are easily forgiven.

I am now 46, and I've seen just about every version and incarnation of Sherlock Holmes that's available for viewing in ANY format, but I just had never gotten around to Billy Wilder's classic, I had thought.

Now, I don't consider myself a prude, in the least, but to a true Holmesian purist such as myself, this seemed almost blasphemous to me, and I just didn't want to think of my beloved Holmes and Watson in that manner. There was no call to add that ridiculous twist.

I was pleasantly surprised, however, to see that it went hand-in-hand with the farcical and satirical nature of the film, and was just a sub-plot that never was expounded on. As I watched, it became delightful and riveting, and the 2 hours, 5 minutes FLEW by.

I didn't even know there were scenes that were deleted until I saw the extras, and imagine my delight when they paid off by explaining the meaning of the 'seven of diamonds' playing card that was removed from the strongbox at the beginning of the movie! It was glaringly obvious to me, after the movie ended, that the playing card was NEVER mentioned at all in the movie, and I had no idea what it was supposed to represent, but the DVD extras showed that it came from the 'Upside-Down Room' subplot that was deleted from the movie. One of the very difficult things about watching movies that got hacked to pieces like this one did is trying to account for everything related to those hacked scenes. This movie didn't even attempt to, but luckily, we are allowed to see what the original audience in 1970 could not; just what the HECK that seven of diamonds was all about! BRAVO!",1109462400,5,2010,4.412398921832884
1452020,4,B00005JKHF,"This film takes as its premise that Watson had a box of papers locked away not to be opened for 50 years after his death containing some Sherlock Holmes stories that discretion prohibited publishing at the time. One of its concerns is that perennial question: was Holmes gay? In a short episode that serves as a kind of prologue he infuriates Watson by pretending that he is and that they are lovers but this is only to escape from a delicate and difficult situation. Or is it? The main storyline, intended in part to shed light on this question, concerns a beautiful young woman who seeks Holmes out to consult him about her engineer husband who has mysteriously disappeared.

Billy Wilder is about the most distinguished director to turn his hand to a Holmes movie so you'd expect it to be at least fun. And it is fun. As should be clear already the storyline is not one of Conan's Doyle's own but it's engagingly dramatic and Wilder is abundantly aware that it's utterly essential for any Holmes story to contain lines like these:

Watson: It is Valladon, isn't it?

Holmes: Obviously. What is not so obvious is why his wedding ring has turned green. And why there are three dead canaries in the coffin. White canaries.

Capital. Robert Stephens does an excellent job as Holmes and makes him camp enough to keep the central question intriguing but not so camp as to be ridiculous. It's all fairly slight stuff but tremendous fun.",1104710400,3,1432,4.648221343873518
1452021,4,B00005JKHF,"Wilder spices up the personality of Sherlock Holmes as the master detective enters another remarkable journey into the world of mystery and crime.  It all begins with a beautiful lady who appears out of nowhere at Holmes' front door, and it seems as if she suffers from amnesia and a lost husband.  However, these mysteries are old news for a genius such as Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson.  Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is an interesting film, but the overall picture lacks the usual spice that Wilder used to combine into his creations.",1073779200,2,554,4.810526315789474
1452022,5,B00005JKHF,"This film is a cult classic and well deserving of that status.  It's one of my favourite films and for YEARS we were promised the excised footage would be replaced and we could finally see this marvellous film in the form Billy Wilder meant it to be.  Well, I am sure like all fans of the film, we waited with hope that NOW they would include all these scenes.  And while the film transfer is great and I was sad to see there is NO footage to speak of to be added.  There are snippets of film of other adventures, stills flashed over a poor soundtrack, but according to MGM there is no extra scenes, they have been lost.
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!
The film is still a must for Billy Wilder, Robert Stephens, Chris Lee or Sherlock Holmes Fans.  But just do not expect all the lost footage to be restored.
It is a very very funny look at Holmes, a more human look perhaps.  This is a mirthful look at the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, lovingly portrayed with a twinkle in his eye by the late great Sir Robert Stephens. The adventures are fun (the ones we see) but mainly centre around a woman's missing husband. Toss in several hundred canaries, the Loch Ness Monster, missing midgets - the Tumbling Pickaloes to be precise - the mysterious red runner, Queen Victoria, some Trappist monks, an ageing ballerina that does not 'look 39' - that is because she is 49!! -who wants Holmes to father her child and an amnesiac damsel in distress that temps Holmes, all done with the best British wit and droll sense of humour...and you have a mix that cannot miss.
Incisive writing and direction, this fill pay homage to Holmes and Watson, with tongue firmly planted in cheek...
Even so, the currently version is a true gem, and so overlooked,
all we have left of Billy Wilder genius vision.",1071964800,74,1777,4.469135802469136
1452023,4,B00005JKHF,"And there is. This film is infamous for having much cut from it by Billy Wilder himself. And while I appreciate his choices I am annoyed with the fact that they are not featured as extras on this DVD. I'm not exactly sure what the deleted scenes (or should that be plots) are but I can't shake the feeling that the first 30 minutes are completely redundant in relation to the rest of the movie and perhaps it might not have been if the movie were longer. Cutting a movie down to size is always a very tough thing to do. The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes suffers, but still manages to be entertaining.
Complaints aside, I really do enjoy Wilder's bizarre approach to Sherlock Holmes. Robert Stephens plays him with more a touch more humor and pathos than most other actors and comes across as a mix between Alan Rickman and Rick Mayall. It's definitely the most pleasant I've seen Holmes. The mystery he gets involved in may be huge, though it's not exactly exciting. Wilder seems more interested in having every element of the story fall into place than give us something with a sense of urgency. And for a film over 2 hours long (it was meant to be 3) it's not cool to have every scene presented at its own pace. There has to be some compromise.
The photography is excellent. The 2.35:1 widescreen frame is used expertly and one can only imagine the horrors of this film being presented in pan and scan. The anamorphic picture looks fine for a 33 year old film and the Mono sound is completely adeqequate. Extras consist of a trailer, an interview with the editor, deleted sequences (not the all of them) and a photo gallery.",1070064000,13,1628,4.484848484848484
1452024,2,B00005JKHF,"Sherlock Holmes adaptions have had a hit or miss quality for the longest time. Even going back to the Rathbone films (which wasn't the earliest incarnation of the fictional great detective in film) we had a clunker for every great one produced. its interesting to watch original films about Holmes as they do investigate elements in the characters that often have been ignored in those that are considered canon. Billy Wilder's ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" belongs in that category. although its not a great Wilder film, it features Wilder's characteristic cynical wit and some nice performances. It's been out of circulation for too long.

Wilder's  Holmes is precursor to Nicolas Meyer's as presented in Herbert Ross' film ""The Seven Percent Solution"". I don't want to reveal the plot here because it would spoil it for fans except to say this highlights one of Holmes' few failures which makes it all the more interesting to me.

Kino Blu-Ray: The recent (8/14) Kino BD looks marginally better in terms of detail but the transfer features a different and inferior source that is poorly cleaned up with dirt, debris and white speckles that mar the transfer. Although a bit darker than the DVD (which improves the film in the day for night sequences). Colors are inconsistent--badly faded one moment and then bold the next (towards the end). While the soft look of the film is often intentional , using this source the presentation looks even worse hurting the look of the film.

The best that can be said for the audio is that is relatively clear but it has no depth whatsoever here.

The special features have largely been ported over from the superior DVD edition. The one new edition is the audio epilogue that was cut prior to release and, while its nice to have, it could have been presented much, much better.

If you have the current DVD the Blu-ray is a marginal improvement as it suffers from its own unique problems which could and should have been taken care of prior to release. This is a careless transfer and the fact that Kino released it as is shows a lapse I. Quality control for this fine film.

THE ORIGINAL DVD REVIEW:

MGM's very good DVD reissue features a number of extras that make this edition worth waiting for. While it doesn't have the cut scenes reintegrated into the film, it does feature a deleted scenes gallery that suggests how the film might have been had it not been butchered prior to general release. Sadly, there's much missing from this ""lost"" footage and, as a result, we don't get a restoration as much as a ""recreation"" with bits and pieces and script segments.

While this isn't the best transfer I've seen, the overall look is still pretty good. Yes, the look of the film is a bit washed out (not sure if that's due to the transfer or film stock but, knowing about the instability of film stock and less than pristine storage conditions many of these films were kept in, I'd vote for negative deterioration)but it is presented in its original aspect ratio. The overall presentation is quite good considering what MGM had to work with and, barring a restoration by someone like Robert Harris, this is probably the best version we'll ever see.

Christopher Lee shines during his brief screen time as Holmes brother. Lee did eventually get to play Holmes as well so it's rather funny to see him playing Holmes brother (after also playing Baskerville in Terry Fisher's Hound of the Baskervilles). Robert Stephens IS Holmes in this film. He lives and breathes the character in ways that Rathbone and others never quite did. I've seen some criticism of Colin Blakely's Watson here but find it to be little more than critcial bluster. Blakely's take on Watson manages to both tip the hat to Nigel Bruce and satirize the way the character was emasculated in most of the film adaptions of Doyle's .

Conclusion: DVD vs. BD -The DVD looks better, cleaner and more consistent overall when compared to the BD. although detail is slightly improved with the BD the negatives of the poor transfer far outweigh the positives.",1064016000,87,4065,4.759943181818182
1452074,3,B00005JKHF,"When I heard The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes was to be released on DVD, I was so excited. I had been waiting for this moment since I first saw the movie as a junior higher (I'm now 24) and read about Billy Wilder's masterpiece trimmed down from its original length. In junior high, I was tempted to save up my allowance to purchase a laser disc player just so I could buy the laser disc copy of PLoSH with the added scenes.
I was disappointed to find on this DVD that the missing scenes were merely tacked on in slideshow form. Perhaps I had raised my hopes too high, but this film deserves a much better treatment than this DVD release.",1060819200,6,641,4.262295081967213
1452075,4,B00005JKHF,"Having not yet seen the DVD I have, however, seen the film on its first theatrical release (double billed with MCKenna's Gold).  Most folks reviewing the film mention Miklos Rozsa's fine score.  Few realize that Billy Wilder based the plot ideas for the film on the Miklos Rozsa Violin Concerto and that Rozsa adapted the Concerto themes to form the basis for the score.  Find the 1955 Jascha Heifeitz recording on RCA (available on CD)or look for the 6 minutes adapted Fantasy recorded by Rozsa.  If ever there was music to inspire a Sherlock Holmes story this is it.",1059955200,3,568,4.707070707070707
1452076,3,B00005JKHF,"Let me preface this with the introduction to the ""Deleted Scenes"" extra on the disc because it describes the film as Wilder had intended:
""The original screenplay as described by Billy Wilder was a symphony in four movements. Following a modern day prologue (represented here in still photos and script pages) the intent was to illustrate four stories that Dr. Watson optednot to have published in the 'Strand Magazine'.
""Wilder wanted to explain Holmes' distrust of women, his drug addiction, his relationship with Dr. Watson; and, at the same time reveal Holmes' human side. The completed version would run approximately three hours, including an intermission. Upon its release in 1970, Wilder's symphony was presented with only two of its four movements.""
Two biographies I've read confirm that Wilder cried openly when he saw the final product.
This Deleted Scenes section is most intriguing as it meticulously reconstructs as much as possible the four ""movements"" of Wilder's ""symphony"" which are titled: ""Original Prologue"" (including an appearance by 'Dr. Watson' circa 1970), ""The Curious Case of the Upside Down Room"", ""The Adventure of the Dumbfounded Detective/Holmes Recounts an Affair of the Past"" and finally ""The Dreadful Business of the Naked Honeymooners"".  As mentioned above, still photos and script pages were used -  and a lot of actual filmed footage which is presented with subtitles because the soundtrack could not be located. Taking all of this into consideration, I'm not all that sure that the three-hour version would have worked; and the final cut released by the studio is something of a disappointment.
The opening scene nicely introduces a somewhat different interpretation of the main characters, with Holmes complaining that Watson is always exaggerating his exploits and putting words into his mouth; and diluting his ""seven-percent solution"" of morphine to five. Then they're off to the final performance of Petrova in The Russian Ballet, after which Rogozgin (Clive Revill),  Petrova's manager advises that she's retiring.
""She's been dancing since she was three-years-old...now she is thirty-eight.""
""I must say, she doesn't look thirty-eight!""
""That's because she is forty-nine.""
(And that, unfortunately, is one of a mere handful of jokes in the screenplay.)
Petrova also wants to have a ""beautiful and brilliant child""; she has the beauty, and Holmes has the brains. But something's afoot! This extended 20-minute scene is meant to confirm Holmes' homosexuality and deny that the heterosexual Watson has been his secret lover. The problem is that it doesn't have anything to do with the basic plot, which doesn't kick in for a full thirty minutes. It may have ""balanced"" Wilder's symphony concept, but out of that context it's totally extraneous.
And by comparison to Arthur Conan Doyle's plots, this one is pretty skimpy.  It was probably intended as a simple framework to hold your interest while the deleted scenes were to enlighten you about the ""private life"" elements. This also makes the title of the film misleading. I won't go into the details of the plot or bring up any spoilers for those who want to see it, except to say that it is shamefully simplistic.
The acting is topnotch all around and Robert Stevens makes an excellent Holmes, though Colin Blakeley's Watson is sometimes too blustery and exasperated; at times you almost expect to hear that ""blowing-off-steam-whistle"" sound affect associated with Lou Costello and Oliver Hardy. Christopher Lee as Holmes' brother, Mycroft, steals the few scenes he's in.
He also provides and interesting extra titled ""Christopher Lee: Mr. Holmes, Mr. Wilder"" in which he recalls a few behind-the-scenes tales of working with Wilder (whom he greatly admires), and brief overview of the Holmes legend, some of which was seen on the ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" DVD released last year. This is followed by a 30-minute interview Ernest Walker, the film's editor who provides some interesting information on  meeting and working with Wilder. There's also the usual Photo Gallery and Trailer.
The best part of the film is the beautifully poignant score by Miklos Rozsa, which I wish had been offered as an isolated track. The cinematography is by Christopher Challis (""Sink the Bismarck!"", ""Two for the Road"", ""Arabesque"", ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"") - but it's hard to judge his contribution because of the poor quality of the transfer. It looks washed out with dull colors; and several transition scenes (probably reel ends) take on a fogged-up appearance, though not one suggesting a London ""shroud"". In fact, the film itself isn't much better that the found footage used for the reconstructed scenes. This is surprising coming from MGM whose ""Women in Love"" DVD is spectacularly lush. For that matter, so are the transfers in their Midnite Movie series. It may have been the original ""Private Life..."" film stock; but most of the Midnight Movies are cheap exploitation and horror films and I find it hard to believe that, say, Roger Corman, had better film than Wilder.
I must be in the minority because on imdb, ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" has a rating of 7.3 rating (with over 500 votes; and  hereAmazon 22 reviews averages a 4  out of 5.
Perhaps I should have bought Wilder's ""Kiss Me, Stupid"" instead.",1059350400,21,5335,5.167824074074074
1452077,5,B00005JKHF,"I am reinterating the Falkirk reviewer's delight in the Deleted Scenes section. Yes, it is mostly text based, but done with great imagination. There is blending of written text, still photographs and music (""Original Prologue"" and ""The Adventure of the Dumbfounded Detective/Holmes Recounts an Affair of the Past""), still photographs syncronized with the dialog soundtrack (""The Curious Case of the Upside Down Room"") and original silent footage with subtitles (""The Dreadful Business of the Naked Honeymooners""). Given the spotty nature of this sort of material, this virtually seamless presentation is a miracle to a fan of this movie such as myself. It is not the same thing as seeing the original cut, but it gives the viewer a very good idea of the sort of movie Wilder was aiming at.",1058918400,4,789,5.076923076923077
1452078,4,B00005JKHF,"Billy Wilder's 1970 THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES was originally as a 200 minute roadshow with intermisssion. But the studio asked that it be cut and Wilder agreed. When he saw the final results, he said he wept.  However, what remains is very fine indeed.  Conceived to reveal why Holmes was a misogynist and dope addict, is still an entertaining, lavishly produced film that peeks at the man behind the famous brain. Robert Stephens and Colin Blakely are Holmes and Watson. Christopher Lee is Holmes smarter brother Mycroft. See midgets, Trappist monks, German spies, a Belgian beauty, the Loch Ness monster and more in this bittersweet tale of a poignant and flawed Sherlock Holmes. Extras include bits and pieces of the missing footage and a recent conversation with Christopher Lee. Highly recommended.
Arthur Conan Doyle, MD, had a lot of spare time on his hands between patients.  To fill the empty hours, he created Sherlock Holmes.  He based Holmes on medical professor Dr. Joseph Bell, known for his awesome powers of deductive reasoning.  Sherlock Holmes is the most famous of all Victorian literary creations.

1452079,5,B00005JKHF,"Finally this classic is available to own on DVD!!
And it's a great package too! Not only do you get a glorious version of the movie, presented in it's correct ratio and anamorphically enhanced, but an excellent bundle of extras. Firstly there's a short featurette entitled ""Christopher Lee: Mr Holmes, Mr Wilder"" in which the actor recounts some behind-the-scenes tales from the making of the movie along with a broad overview of the Holmes legend. A small portion of this material was first seen on last years' ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" disc but it's still a very interesting and enjoyable extra. Next up is an extended interview with film editor Ernest Walker who gives his own account of the making of the film along with some good information on the many scenes which did not make the final cut.
After that we have the Deleted Scenes section which, while mostly text based, is probably the best extra on the disc. What we are treated to here is a partial reconstruction (using actual footage, stills and script excerpts) of four deleted scenes - ""Original Prologue"" (including an appearance by 'Dr Watson' circa 1970), ""The Curious Case of the Upside Down Room"", ""The Adventure of the Dumbfounded Detective/Holmes Recounts an Affair of the Past"" and finally ""The Dreadful Business of the Naked Honeymooners"". Rounding out the extras list we have a Photo Gallery set to the excellent score music and the Original Theatrical Trailer which , like the main feature, is presented in an anamorphically enhanced format.

1452080,5,B00005JKHF,"THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES is often called a ""comedy-drama""; it's not, no more than Billy Wilder's other great films -- DOUBLE INDEMINTY, THE LOST WEEKEND, ACE IN THE HOLE, SUNSET BOULEVARD, and the little-known FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO -- are. Like most of the scripts crafted by Wilder and his major writer-collaborators -- most notably, Charles Brackett, Raymond Chandler, and I.A.L. Diamond -- THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES is simply a drama with trenchant humor that only serves to bring forth the sad, dark, bitter aspects of human nature which Wilder's work inevitably explores.
Holmes afficionados generally disdain Wilder's film, partly because they think Wilder and Diamond are mocking their heroes -- which couldn't be further from the truth (imbuing Holmes with such biting wit only magnifies his brilliance), and also because, in the perplexing case that Wilder and Diamond have fashioned, Holmes is, ultimately, outwitted by his adversary.
Even this statement is misleading, though. Holmes, to all intents and purposes, allows himself to be outwitted; indeed, he knows that he's allowing his personal feelings for a woman, of all things, to get in the way of his deductive reasoning, knows that this decision to pursue the case in the face of this inevitable defeat will ultimately breach the intellectual armour he's cultivated and fashioned over a lifetime in such a way that it can never be fully mended.
That's why Watson failed to chronicle this particular adventure in the pages of the Strand Magazine, as he had the Great Detective's other cases: not merely because it was of ""a personal nature,"" but because of Watson's regard for the very feelings and humanity that Holmes has always taken such great pains to hide.
It is rather ironic that the Baker Street Irregulars -- those most rabid of Holmes afficionados -- refuse to accept that the Great Detective is not flesh-and-blood, but merely the product of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fertile imagination, since they also reject Wilder and Diamond's view of him as fully human, complete with flaws, faults, and failings.  It's also a great pity, for in THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES they would at last meet their hero face to face.",1048896000,10,2218,5.060109289617486

Seen this other day! What an homage to Sherlock Holmes! It's a must to any fan of the books dying to see a faithful and 100% victorian version.
It features Colin Stephens as the famous detective, in a acccurate, mysoginist personification and Colin Blakely as an amusing Watson. The cast also has Christopher Lee (one of my fave actors) as the snob Mycroft Holmes and Stanley Holloway in a small part. There's a french actress that is the Holmes only passion in life and she actually has a naked little scene! I guess the 70's permitted that--
Anyway, Billy Wilder couldn't resist putting his comic flair here, and it works surprisingly well, each scene with Stephens and Blakely is delicious.

The Concert of Europe had collapsed, political upheaval across Europe occurred in 1848, the German unification in 1870 changed the politics of Europe, the Scramble for Africa had begun and an arms race is taking place between Britain and Germany. The balance of power was unstable and military developments, in the making, like the submarine could shift it. Against this background a woman has come to London in search of her husband, an engineer who offered his services to the British government. A cab drops her off at 221 Baker Street. After the cabbie pulled her from the river he found the address on her and drops her off. After some initial hesitation Holmes has become rather curious himself over matters. The story begins rather cleverly and outlines the struggle with boredom and drugs through the story of the free tickets to Swan Lake and why Watson welcomes the case..
