7570495,3,B019DX8P2O,"This is a film I foresee growing in stature through effusive word of mouth from those who relate to its relationship roller coaster aspect. It does a lot of genre surfing, with a thoroughly original approach to all, while showing perceptive insight in to human connectivity. The lead girl is also a real find. Distinctive as it may be, I downgrade it a bit on the star scale for what I perceived as a cumulative absence of ""punch."" I didn't walk away quite as tickled or haunted as I may have hoped.",1455926400,,499,4.434782608695652

Rob suffers a car accident, loses the love of his life Nina, and then tries to kill himself. He now works in a supermarket and meets Holly who is completely enamored with him. They get to know each other and go on a date, which goes well. They fall into bed together only to have undead Nina join them in their bed. The living couple is understandably shocked and disgusted since she covers everything in a layer of blood from her wounds. Nina returns every time they are intimate. What should they do? How can they make her stay dead?

Nina Forever is a sexier, funnier, more poignant version of Burying the Ex and Life After Beth. Of course there are some differences, but the main story is the same: the previous or dead girlfriend of the main character serves as a wedge in the new romance that the couple must overcome in some way order to be happy. The other films were pretty predictable and a little goofy in their humor, which made the feelings involved less defined and effective. Nina Forever has a more emotional story and more realistic and flawed characters. The exposition is streamlined into about 10 minutes so the bulk of the film builds up Rob and Holly's relationship and throws them in conflict with Nina. All of the information is still conveyed, but it's done in such a condensed way that feels like it's longer. The accident is a sparse, silent scene with a body on the ground in the aftermath with the wrecked car in the background. Rob's situation is illustrated in a gossipy conversation between Holly and her awful, judgmental coworkers.

Rob looks like he needs a hug. His melancholy air is understandable since he lost the love of his life quite recently, but it seems to repel other people. He's still trying to physically and mentally recover from the accident and its aftereffects. There's not much of his character because he is kind of stuck in time, not being able to get past Nina's death. Holly is quite the opposite. She's 19 years old and just getting started with her adult life, away from home for the first time at college to eventually be a paramedic. She finds Rob's state attractive. To her, it means that he loved intensely to attempt suicide. She fantasizes about what that intensity would be like in bed. Although kind of insensitive and fetishistic, it leads them into a sweet romance and eventually into a relationship. Before their relationship, Holly was dumped by a man who said she was too nice, sweet, and vanilla. Then her co-workers judge her as being weird and morbid. At this point, she's still trying to define herself and find herself underneath all these judgments from others.

Enter Nina, a beautiful woman in Rob and Holly's bed whenever they have sex. Frozen in time, she appears as she did when Rob last saw her: nude and with all the lacerations and broken bones from the accident. Her makeup is always smeared and tearstained; she always appears the same. Because of her broken bones, she can't really hold herself up, giving her a boneless, lifeless quality to set her apart (in addition to the still bleeding wounds) from the living nude people in their bed. She isn't happy to be there or see her beloved boyfriend try to move one. While she insists she wants nothing, it's clear that she's jealous of Holly and her vitality, taking every opportunity to sarcastically insult her, cut her down, and undermine her relationship with Rob. Nina is bitter, cold, and cutting, thinking of anything horrible to say to interrupt their relationship. It's unclear, but I assume she's very unlike Nina in life because she's the bitter representation of everything Rob missed out on due to her death. I can't hate Nina because I feel so sorry for her. She has to see them happy and full of life while she has no life, no motivation, no reason for even being there. Her commentary is also quite funny and sometimes shocking in its edge.

To Rob, Nina is his inability to let go of the past. Many of the things she sardonically says is true: she and Rob never broke up; he still loves her; he can't break up with her now; and he will never be able to say goodbye. All of these things will stay with Rob forever. They may fade, but it was a traumatic, scarring experience to witness his girlfriend dying and living forever without her. To Holly, Nina is her jealousy and everyone's opinions about her. Although Nina is largely why Holly was first attracted to Rob, she resents Nina's presence. At first, she tried to include Nina in their lovemaking and even got Nina Forever tattooed on her to show that she will forever be remembered. Nina isn't there for herself, so none of that mattered. She's dead. She doesn't care about being remembered and she can't feel anything except the shard of glass in the back of her throat. Nina's attempt at coping with this is reflected in the scene where she helps Rob carry the sheets bloodied by Nina to the dumpster. She helps him bear the load of his grief. After a while, the constant sarcastic insults and blood everywhere starts to get to Holly. She tries to remove every bit of Nina from their now shared apartment and their lives. Despite her best efforts, all anyone who knew Nina can ever see is Nina's absence when they see Holly and Rob together. This is shown quite awkwardly in the scene where Rob takes Holly to meet Nina's parents. On what planet is that a good idea? It was incredibly unpleasant, awkward, and horrible for everyone. Holly can truly never escape Nina when she's with Rob. She will always be reminded of how she's trying to fit herself into the space Nina left and she doesn't quite fit in.

After a while, Holly starts to see Nina when she's by herself because Nina is no longer there for Rob. Rob has used this experience to realize the truths Nina represents and be able to move on. He even sees how constantly visiting her parents may not be the best or healthiest thing for all involved. Holly becomes so consumed by her feelings of inadequacy and her drive to eradicate Nina that she causes Nina to be even more present around her. In one of the final scenes, Nina dates someone else and has sex with them in her old dorm while Nina appears beneath her and watches silently. It's a weird scene, but it shows how Holly is overcompensating to prove to everyone that she's just as good as Nina or is over Rob or whatever else she wants to prove. The fact is that she can no longer enjoy whatever she does because what everyone else is thinking is in the back of her mind all the time, physically represented by Nina. The final scene has Rob coming over to try to make up with Holly, but he sees her bloodstained sheets (signs that Nina has been there) and realizes that it just won't work. The ending is the complete opposite of the other predictable films. It's stark in its realism and its sadness.

Nina Forever is a dark film because of the way the accident is handled. Rob and Nina were supposed to be together forever and now they can't. It's tragic and moving on isn't easy. The humor in the film doesn't lighten the mood enough to dispel the tragedy. It's always there whether Nina is onscreen or not, felt by each character. Although much of the film has the characters mostly nude, it doesn't feel exploitative or sleazy in any way. It shows the vulnerability and the reality of a new relationship. Although on the surface Nina Forever can be seen as two women fighting over a man, it isn't at its core. It's really so much more than that and that's why Nina Forever is infinitely better than Life After Beth and Burying the Ex. Both take the tragedy out of the deaths and devolve into having one man pick between two women or have the two women vying for one man's attention. Fiona O'Shaughnessy flawlessly and believably plays the sarcastic yet ethereal Nina. Abigail Hardingham portrays the young and eager to prove herself Holly. Both characters are incredibly fleshed out and realistic which makes their conflict so much more complicated. Nina Forever shines as the best of its genre. It's only flaw is a bit of pacing issues, but it's a formidable debut film. I look forward to seeing more from all involved.",1455667200,3,8169,4.572013651877133
7570497,4,B019DX8P2O,"Such a weird idea, but I loved this movie! Its mostly a drama and fortunately the characters are quite good, backed up by some nice acting. The story can be a little on the slow side, but it feels appropriate. Now, when they have sex, the sheets get bloody and then she appears in bed with them, looking pretty torn up and creepy, barely moving but definitely vocal. Its a pretty awesome sight to be honest. And thats pretty much what this movie is. A romantic drama with a corporeal ghost. Its highly unique and very entertaining if you like strange movies with nudity, and odd kind of necrophilia and supernatural threesomes. Yeah, just watch it.",1455408000,3,648,4.594827586206897
7570498,4,B019DX8P2O,"Nina (Fiona O'Shaughnessy) discovers Spitfires are not the safest car on the road in the first scene. Her boyfriend Rob (Cian Barry) is coping with her death as he gets by working at the supermarket. Co-worker Holly (Abigail Hardingham) who didn't like be called ""vanilla"" by her last boyfriend develops a dark side. Her and Rob hook up and discover that his dead girlfriend Nina likes to make appearances during their love making.

Normally such an absurdity would prevent any more such contacts, but Rob and Holly decide they will work through it as the scene turns bloody and requires frequent cleaning. Nina's sharp tongue and catty attitude become the highlight of this dark comedy,

I liked the film up until the ending when the humor aspect fell short as compared to the rest of the feature. They developed a great story, did it well, but I didn't like the final closure. It is a good film for indie lovers.

If you liked  ""Burying The Ex"" and ""Life After Beth"" give this one a view.

8744874,5,B019DX8P2O,"This is a bloody love story. Lots of blood but still a love story. No killing.

What if your girlfriend was hit by a car and died and after her death you got a new girlfriend living together and suddenly she came back with bloody look. The more problem is whenever she appears blood oozes out from her and wet all over the white bed sheet that you and your girlfriend share. And you just have to change the sheet again and again and again.

More detail here:
The movie follows Holly and Rob, a young couple who fell in love after meeting each other at work. Holly found herself fascinated that Rob had recently attempted suicide and decided to muster up the courage to talk to him. Rob doesn't tell her the reasons why, but after a night of passionate sex it is revealed to her that Rob lost his girlfriend in a car crash. Holly finds this out because his girlfriend, Nina, comes back to life while they are having sex. She continues to torment the couple every time they have sex.
More problem she just keeps coming back and tries to interrupt you guys. I think she just wants to have threesome or something.

But you as a male irresponsible guy just wants to get rid of him. You don't love her anymore and just thinks that she is a burden. She is a monster. She is a bloody hell.
But your girlfriend kind of sympathize her.
And the death ex figures it out.
And more over, the ex happens to stuck to your now girlfriend at last.
Now you are about to lost your now girlfriend.

Is is bacoming a lesbian love story now?
Well I am afraid it will be likely yes.
But nothing like lesbian sex though.
Some threesome not so explicit sex scenes are there. With very artistic bloody body.

You will love this movie or very much hate it.

Critics are crazy about the fact that these two director's nice collaboration turned out to be a great masterpiece and I think it should be hailed too.

Look at the poster. Isn't it jus tempting to look at?
It's not a stupid hollywood comedy.

Another Hole in the Head Genre Film Festival, British Independent Film Awards, Fright-Fest, Melbourne Underground Film Festival, Morbido Fest, Toronto After Dark Film Festival, Trieste Science+Fiction PLUS a few more film festival they all hailed for this movie.

After making a bunch of shorts and some TV shows the two directors Ben Blaine, Chris Blaine were named as  'One to Watch' by movieScope Magazine and you will see why when you see this film.",1475280000,,2427,4.4337078651685395
