1359346,3,B00004W1A2,"Image Entertainment's release of STRANGER FROM VENUS, as part of their Wade Williams DVD Collection, is an interesting little find for old sci-fi film fans.  STRANGER FROM VENUS shares many common elements with the all-time classic THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL -- most notably a kind alien who wishes to warn humanity of the consequences of atomic warfare.  It also shares a basic plot structure with the infamous 1950s British sci-fi flick DEVIL GIRL FROM MARS: an alien landing in rural England and ""hanging out"" in and around a local inn/tavern.  If you've seen and enjoyed either film, you'll like this one.
STRANGER FROM VENUS has surprisingly strong performances from its lead actors: Patricia Neal and Helmut Dantine.  In one well-done sequence, for instance, Dantine demonstrates to a reporter his superior intellect by reading a newspaper article, one paragraph at a time in a different language.
STRANGER FROM VENUS certainly is for genre fans alone.  It's very ""talky"" and, outside of cheap flying saucers at the very end, provides little cheesy special effects to make fun of.  The DVD also doesn't have any bonus features, not even a trailer.  So you've got to make sure that the price is worth it to you (the transfer is very good however).",969667200,17,1255,4.947619047619048
1359367,3,B00004W1A2,"This 1954 British black/white entry is a low budget, minimal special effects film.  Unfortunately, it is compared to The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951) which was a marvel of special effects and a great story. Of course, you have Patricia Neal who was in both films as the female lead.

A spaceship from Venus lands in the English countryside and drops off a representative.
He wanders to a scene of a car accident which was caused by his spaceship and finds Susan North badly injured.  How she got some of the tears in her dress from the accident is a mystery.

Next we change to the Inn run by a father and daughter.  This inn becomes the focal point of the story.

This first contact is greeted by a sense of awe by the local doctor, innkeeper and his daughter.  Entering the inn is Susan's fianc, a government official, who is looking for her.

The Venusian Stranger has no name and talks in a mechanical fashion with no emotion.  His mission is clear--he is there to prepare the way for his representatives to confer with the world leaders.

Unfortunately, human nature kicks into play as the machinery of government come full circle. The British are tossing out a welcome mat for the coming representatives, but beneath their welcome mat is something more sinister.  Definitely, it is a poor display of diplomacy by the Brits.

As the story develops Susan and the Stranger grow closer.  She is fascinated and intrigued by him and shows him her special retreat by the pond where she goes to be alone. He is attracted to her.

The Stranger comes to value the special place.  The serenity of the place is very vivid in black and white as the camera pans the surroundings.

This film focuses more on story.  Unfortunately, little is said about life on Venus except for a few comments which tie in with the ending.

The 50's were the time of science fiction film exploration.  Overall, it is a descent film for the mid-fifties.",1263772800,,1929,4.587719298245614
1359368,4,B00004W1A2,"I was expecting more excitement and suspense than the film offered but was not disappointed. The film is pertinent to todays viewer, only the clothing and surroundings date it. Dont expect to see over the top special effects, this movie caters to the mind, not the eye..I am glad i have it in my scifi collection.",1252281600,,313,4.607142857142857
1359369,4,B00004W1A2,"I'm surprised by the generally negative reviews this one has gotten. I suppose if you're looking for Star Wars or Alien, this movie would disappoint. And if you're looking for badly executed cheese, which a lot of the sci fi of the era undeniably was, you'll be put off by the largely serious tone, careful writing, and the lack of flimsy plot and worse acting. This movie has a solid story, quite good acting, a few light comic touches, a love story... the only serious flaw is the predictable melodrama of the ending. There wasn't even a lot of pseudoscience (although the scientific premise of the movie doesn't actually work, and they probably knew that even in 1953). Bottom line, this is what science fiction is supposed to be - a hard look at what we are as humans, and how we react to discovery. No, we don't get to watch Los Angeles get nuked (Kronos) or have to sit through an Awful Alien Dance Scene (Cat Women of the Moon), but it's just that avoidance of pointless special effects and irritating pseduodrama, that makes this movie a solid piece of storytelling. Recommended if you want a break from the swiss cheese plots of the more typical 50's fare. (Which I do enjoy for a laugh).

I'm not certain you could even make this movie today - propose a science fiction premise and you absolutely have to have either a hot space babe or a superhypermegaweapon, ideally both. It's worth watching this just to muse on just how sci fi has been hijacked in the last 50+ years, and turned into an endless special-effect-o-rama.",1246147200,4,1532,4.591240875912408
1359370,5,B00004W1A2,"I don't know I could be wrong, but it seems to me that movies made today require a ton of special effects ( especially in the Sci Fi - Fantasy genre ) to keep an audience interested. Nothing wrong with this though, as I myself enoy a little escapist entertainment as much as the next person. Having said that though I must confess that it is my opinion that good writing and acting will win out over high tech effects almost everytime with few eceptions and nothing is better if you have both. Which brings me to this film, Stranger From Venus. It has very little in the effects department (Plan 9 From Outer Space has more) but the script and acting are a notch above alot of movies in this genre  today or in the 1950's when this film was made. The story is not your average alien invasion plot that dominate most film in this category, which to me is a breath of fresh air. In fact,I'd put Stranger From Venus in a category of Sci Fi films that are a bit different from the rest of the crowd like The Man Who Fell To Earth, Man Facing SouthEast and Signs. So,if you are looking for exploding planets,high tech battle cruisers or strange looking creatures, you won't find it here but if you seek a good well written story from a different angle then your patience will be rewarded.",1135382400,21,1283,4.323651452282157
1359371,3,B00004W1A2,"I concur with most of the reviews already written..  a ""soft"" sci-fi story relying on dialogue rather than special effects. Patrica O'Neil definately made this movie.",1123200000,5,166,5.384615384615385
1359372,3,B00004W1A2,"This movie is the most obvious remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still.  I like both films, but besides the hilarious special effects and the casting of an American actress as English, I prefer this film.  The stranger, played by Helmut Dantine, is very believable in the part, maybe just because of his Austrian accent.  Also, the slightly romantic departure from the plot of The Day the Earth Stood Still warmed my unscientific heart.  The messages are the same:  anti-war, and that was very timely in the early 1950's.  Perhaps it's still quite timely....",1115596800,4,558,4.821052631578947
1359373,2,B00004W1A2,"From Image Entertainment and The Wade Williams collection comes the mid 50's British answer to The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).  But where The Day the Earth Stood Still excels and survives as a classic atomic age science fiction thriller, this film fell into the realm of the anti-thriller, nearly putting me to sleep.  Starring Patricia Neal as Susan North and Helmut Dantine as 'The Stranger', the story begins with the landing of a craft, which we never actually see, and the crashing of a car driven by Ms. North.  I guess the crash was a fatal one, cause she ain't moving, but what's this?  A figure comes to her aid...

Soon we cut to a small hotel in a small English village, and news of Susan's wrecked car and her body missing arrives, along with an odd sort of fellow, who raises a few eyebrows.  Oh, he's not all alien looking and such, with hideous tentacles and great, bug eyes, but his mannerisms seem a bit off.  He soon reveals himself to be from another planet, but this isn't really taken too seriously, until Susan walks in the door.  Apparently the stranger revived her from her slight condition of death, and now she's all better.  Proof of the strangers alien status is now here, and yet no one seems to bat an eye at the fact that this is a honest to goodness alien in their midst, one from the planet Venus, as the title of the film tells us.  Anyway, the government soon gets involved, and the motive of the stranger's arrival on Earth is soon learned, but they are still suspicious and even envious at his people's achievements.  His presence seems a peaceful one, but, as they always do, the government manages to screw things up, and loose out on a potentially wonderful opportunity to advance the human race.  Does the alien truly 'come in peace', or does he have ulterior motives?  Is he a friendly messenger, or a scout ship leading the way of a horde of brain sucking alien fiends from another planet?

Even with its' low budget, The Stranger from Planet Venus does have small charms, playing more like a soap opera episode than a science fiction movie, as Patricia Neal's character struggles with her feelings for her fianc vs. those for her new space buddy.  The story is very slow moving, but at least the run time, 74 minutes, doesn't outstay its' welcome.  What makes this film different from The Day the Earth Stood Still is the makes of this film managed to suck all the life energy out of the story, and present a very dry, boring, and un-climatic tale of first contact with aliens on Earth.

Image Entertainment provides a decent looking picture here with some noticeable flaws, and the audio is a bit soft at times, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend this to the casual viewer.  There are no special features, other than chapter stops and a snazzy looking box.  I did notice that Image has re-released this film as a double feature with The Cosmic Man (1959), for the same price as this release, so if you are really interested, you should look that up version and save yourself a little money.

1359374,3,B00004W1A2,"This one definitly has a familiar theme to it. Namely ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"". While not as good it still has an interesting storyline. My only problem with this film is the lack of sci-fi effects. Only a brief encounter with a flying saucer. Well acted and the transfer to DVD is very good.

1359375,4,B00004W1A2,"This film deserves more attention I think because it deals as much with the response of earth establishment types as it does with the possible aliens themselves...
The plot concerns an alien landing in a remote British village...  and how this alien relates to earthly preferences and habits... This alien has compassion and vision and is willing to share it with humanity..but of course the establishment types are not ready for this and soon botch thinks up horribly!
It has a strong anti military flavor to it  as well as antinuclear testing... The alien warns that continued testing could cause a destabilized earth orbit which could endanger other worlds... among other things...
The special effects are not unusual or even spectacular... but they managed to create an aura of mystery none the less!",1016323200,4,804,5.037593984962406
1359376,1,B00004W1A2,"A male visitor from Venus lands in what they say is USA, but in fact is the dullest of English country-sides, populated by people who barely seem to notice his arrival. In fact, they're too busy doing what they've been doing all their lives: uninspired English matinee theatre. If instead of a visitor from Venus the man Helmut Dantine were, say, a visitor from Tonga, the required changes in the script would be minimal, and the locals' astonishment at his speaking impeccable Oxford English might perhaps be even greater. Although one of the most unbearably boring sci-fi movies of all times, ""Stranger from Venus"" provides first-rate documentary evidence of the profound, meaningful changes which the notion of Alien (both terrestrial and extra-) has undergone in the intervening 50 years. It also shows how even inane sci-fi script-writing has gone a long way...",983577600,5,866,5.105633802816901
7924446,3,B00004W1A2,"A no-name stranger (Helmut Dantine) comes from Venus with a message. Naturedly the message is too important to trust to any one country. So he arranges to meet with all the representatives of the world in two days. While waiting for this meeting He interacts with a handful of people at a local English inn. There they get to know each other personally. Some such as Susan north (Patricia Neal) very personally. Will they make the meeting or will greed raise its ugly head and try to use this no names stranger for nefarious purposes?

Of course we know what sort of people attract Susan because when Patricia Neal mad the same choice in the movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" Now days most people equate Patricia Neal with Anacin commercials.

Helmut is no slacker. He has been in several TV programs and who can forget the movie ""Guerrilla Girl"" (1953).

The music was well done mix of spooky and sci-fi sounds composed by Eric Spear. Eric composed original music for more than 40 movies and programs.",1506643200,,1007,4.646067415730337

7924448,4,B00004W1A2,"This felt like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone.
A mysterious something is spotted (but not shown) flying over England.  Poor Susan North (Patricia Neal) sees the light and crashes her car.  She goes missing as a strange man shows up at an inn and asks for something to drink that he admits he cant pay for.  He has no name and is loath to show his face to the camera.  The locals only become upset when he admits he doesnt pay taxes.  When the police try to arrest him they find they cant lay a hand on him..........literally.  Then he says hes from Venus.  And he can read minds.  And he quickly learns that humans are duplicitous and downright sneaky.  (He came all this way just to find that out!)  Naturally, the military gets involved.  At what point do they realize they are no match for someone from another planet with superior powers.  Hubris.

Patricia Neal was fabulous, as was Helmut Dantine as The Stranger.  The plot is overly familiar.  Not bad for a film of that period.  And because I like old 50s sci-fi flicks, I appreciated the effort more than the execution.",1464912000,,1088,4.474489795918367
