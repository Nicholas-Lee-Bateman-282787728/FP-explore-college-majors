3718747,5,B001NGPLCM,I love this series. I don't understand why companies stop putting out seasons. They start but don't finish. This happens alot I have incomplete seasons of shows. Lavern n Shirley The Fifth Season is finally comming out after so many years. Let's keep our fingers cross for Happy Days.,1326844800,,284,4.816326530612245
3718748,5,B001NGPLCM,"I hope CBS and Amazon consider releasing this show as a ""manufacture on demand"" item!!  It's a shame that this show's season's aren't being released on a regular basis when less popular and not as good shows are consistently out on DVD.",1312848000,4,236,4.619047619047619
3718749,5,B001NGPLCM,"We Happy Days Fans need to ban togather and demand the release of the rest of the Happy Days Series. They have told us right after the death of Tom Bosley aka Mr. C that they would be  speeding up production of releasing the rest of the series. Well that has been about a year ago. Theh studio where the seires was made, needs to wrote to and really push them to get the rest of the seires out on DVD now and quit dragging there feet about it. And have their  video distributors put into high production speed about getting the rest of the series onto the shelves within 2 months. They have the equipment to do it that fast. So let's cheer up all of us Happy Days Fans to encourage the slow-pokes from Hollywood and get the rest of our series of Happy Days on DVD and onto the shelves and on Amazon so we all can own the rest of the series fo the show we all love. BIGTEX",1304899200,21,871,4.028901734104046
3718750,5,B001NGPLCM,"I'm sorry to say that Happy Days Season 5 may never be released.  The sticking point with many fans is the original music.  Songwriters own the rights for sales profit as compared to TV re-runs.  In season 5,  Suzi Quatro performs many of her own songs and cover remakes. Actors also may have to paid based on their contract.  This is disappointing because the Ron Howard/Donny Most years made for good TV.  ""Mr. C""  was a great dad because he never tried to be Andy Griffith.  He watched the T.V. football game then helped solve the inner family and friends problems at his own pace.  Tom Bosley as ""Mr. Cunningham"" recently passed away.  He was funny and very 1950's. Season 5 also was the year the trio (Richie, Potsie and Ralph) moved on to college.  Besides rocker Suzi Quatro as Leather Tuscadero, joining the cast was poster boy Scott Baio (Cha Chi) and attractive Lynda Goodfriend ( Lori Beth).  Fonzie (Henry Winkler) made even the weak episodes worth watching.  It's time for those involved to iron out their differences for us fans who followed this show.  Same for the reunion special.....  7-27-2014 Update:  I'm happy the show finally came out.  Since there are  changes in some of the songs in the DVD it's important to hold onto the old re-runs,  commercials and all if fan still has them.  It obvious future seasons will never come out again in original form.  Too much litigation and red tape.",1299456000,28,1411,4.654471544715447
3718751,5,B001NGPLCM,"To the powers that be: RELEASE THE REST ALREADY! Why does this happen to series? Why are just a few (and sometimes less) seasons released and then.................waiting for more? I have an idea- release ALL seasons of ALL series. Produce them on an ""on demand"" basis. Then print them as needed. There will be no waste and everyone should be happy, including the series owners who will pocket the profits. Please just consider this idea.",1298160000,8,438,4.8533333333333335
3718752,5,B001NGPLCM,I would really like to complete my Happy Days DVD collection. This is a wholesome show suitable for the whole family and so much better than a lot of the stuff out there that has already been released to DVD. I hope the rest of the series is released soon!,1294531200,8,256,4.14

3718754,5,B001NGPLCM,"It's been nearly two years since season four was released...where is Season 5??  I've got the first four seasons & I'd love to have the remaining seasons.  Sure it wasn't quite the same when Richie left & new cast members tried to fill those shoes, but I still enjoy Happy Days then & now.",1281484800,10,289,4.333333333333333

3718763,5,B001NGPLCM,"Heyyyy! Stay tuned for some more Happy Days"" = woah! Not much more to say - this is one of the most classic sitcoms in modern history, and you never get tired of watching it - or laughing at it. It is a bummer that some episodes are not exactly the way that you remember them on T.V. (some of the music is edited out due to those idiotic copyright laws) - but these characters will live on forever and the show is still heart-warming and funny, I love it!",1481932800,,455,4.066666666666666

I have to say that I love all the episodes - okay, the jumping-the-shark episode was a bit much but not the ""death of the show"" urban legend makes it out to be!! I believe Ron Howard leaving is what knocked the show down but he had the desire to do other things - and look what he's done since this show!! Much as we want things to stay the same, change is constant and you gotta deal with it - even if it's by going kicking and screaming!! :)",1472947200,,557,3.810344827586207

Has some classic episodes, The two favorites are ""Hard Cover' and ""My Favorite Orkan"" Watching the Mork episode shows how brilliant Robin Williams was, since the episode was considered the worst written before they cast Robin. When he joined the episode his remarkable talent was well worth watching! That episode alone is worth buying this DVD set! Lots of laughs with this one.",1456012800,,444,4.779220779220779

3718811,5,B001NGPLCM,"I was always a big fan of this show when I was growing up, which is why I bought this DVD.  The characters were down to earth, and the dialogue was simple to understand, which you don't find in many tv shows that are on today on cable television.  I'd rather buy older shows on DVD that showed how simple life was back in those days, than pay for cable today.",1417737600,,359,4.042253521126761

3718822,4,B001NGPLCM,"Happy Days Season 5 has finally arrived... no thanks to Paramount Pictures & CBS Fox not giving the cast their cut for the DVD's... They sued the company for their cut, and this almost produced a no return for Happy Days to anymore seasons on DVD after season 4! Thanks to all the fans who wanted more, for writing the company and telling them we want more... Season 5 has a few key episodes, Hollywood part 1, 2, & 3 where Fonz jumps the shark... And now when a show tanks, they call it jumping the shark... Or at least is burning fumes... My favorite Orkan... Robin Williams first appearance as Mork From Ork, which spun off Mork & Mindy... This series also Spun off La'Vern & Shirley and Joanie Loves Chachi... The Fonz show was supposed to be another spin off, but Henry Winkler was needed on happy Days after Richie (Ron Howard) and Ralph (Donny Most) left the show.  Another episode, Richie Almost dies... He has a Motorcycle accident... The fonz is in his room crying and praying for his friend's recovery... he makes a deal with God for the safe return of his friend.

I have only one thing to say for Happy Days after season 7 without Richie & Ralph left... SIT ON IT!",1411862400,,1177,4.394495412844036

3718836,4,B001NGPLCM,"Its a good season! However, CBS / Paramount deleted the feeling of the episode by deleting Leather's song in ""Richie Almost Dies"".
I know their trying to save a $ here and there trying to delete the original songs in the episodes, they don't want to pay the cast, but really?  How far do you have to go to save money? Give the consumers what they want, The Original versions.",1405468800,4,375,4.357142857142857
3718837,3,B001NGPLCM,"While there are a few good episodes here, there are as many or more dud ones.  I just watched half a dozen tonight and was amazed how much ""padding"" filler shows the network allowed itself.  ""Marion's Misgivings"" (Marion feels she's not young enough in her marriage), ""Richie Almost Dies"" (on a motorcycle he buys), ""Spunkless Spunky"" (Fonzie's dog is feeling blue), ""Be My Valentine"" (each of the cast does a song and dance routine in honor of V-day), ""Our Gang"" (Richie recalls first meeting Fonzie when he was still in a gang), ""4th Anniversary Special"" (a recap of various episodes in the guise of Richie's girlfriend interviewing everybody on what the ""typical middle class family"" is).  Believe me, you'll want to be doing something else simultaneously as you watch these as it's unlikely you'll be able to sit through these with nothing else to do on hand.

Don't despair.  There are still some gems. ""My Favorite Orkan"" with a very young Robin Williams scores high on the Happy Days Richter Scale - Mork and the Fonz battle it out for Richie whom Mork wants to take back to Ork. Richie's journalism assignment in ""Nose for News"" is quite good, as are the episodes ""Potsie Gets Pinned"" and ""Joanie's First Kiss"" - a great scene here with Fonzie and Richie demonstrating to Joanie the hazards of ""parking"".  Fonzie also puts in a memorable ballet perfomance in in the last episode, ""Do You Want To Dance"" in which Fonz and his new ballerina girlfriend perform a small ballet ending the season on a decent note. Other episodes however (all episodes in the above paragraph for example) take cheese to a new level, that is when the program isn't spent ""recalling fond memories from previous episodes"" or having a plotless song and dance ""Valentine's Day"" episode.  Anyway the first half of the season is stronger than the second, though Fonzie jumping a shark pretty much stood for where the season was at this point.  It was bloated on its own success and you can see the writers felt they could pretty much dish out anything and the public was gonna eat it up.  For nostagia's sake (Suzi Quatro and Chachi adding points in this regard), and for the episodes which are good, I give it a generous 3 stars!

Note: I still look fwd to season 6.  ;)  While I'm not sure ""Ralph Malph"" ever ""had it"", Henry Winkler's ""The Fonz"" usually did..  I can't think of any other actor that could have done what Winkler did in that role which to this day remains icon.  It's no wonder his character became such a large part of the show as the seasons went on.  [Should be noted that Winkler was an accomplished actor outside of Fonzie role as well - see him in the movie ""The One And Only"".. good stuff..]  It is also fun watching the other characters in the show grow up season by season - which is why I look fwd to season 6.  Happy Days has its hits and misses for sure, but there is no denying the huge nostalgia factor of this show for the 70s gen Xer who grew up on it.  And who, to this day, doesn't still envy the Fonz's SUPERHUMAN POWER over women? And jukeboxes..  ;)  Long before David Duchovny in Californication (NOT for the whole family), there was the Fonz in Happy Days (who somehow still managed to be ""family"").  Winkler's role in Happy Days was very ""tongue in cheek"".  Bring on Season 6.",1405468800,5,3295,4.539763113367174

3718841,2,B001NGPLCM,"If you didn't grow up in the Fifties, then you definitely wouldn't appreciate what CBS/Paramount did to this latest release of one of the most highly rated shows about teens and Rock and Roll. The reason we enjoyed it so much was because it was nostalgic, the Fonz was sort of like a plagiarized copy of Elvis Presley, as he looked in his early movies, leather jacket, strut and attitude, also similar to James Dean and Marlon Brando. But with this latest version, all of the original music is gone, except for the karoake singing of Anson Williams and a few songs by Suzi Quatro, So then most fans of the series would rate this season quite highly because they did not grow up with this music, so it wouldn't matter to them that it is all gone, replaced with the most awful generic noise that is barely audible in most episodes.

Ron Howard is the best character in the series, he looks and acts like Archie in the popular comics. In fact, most of these plots are like comic book stories, with characters that are more or less one dimensional, Ralph Malph the clown, Potsie kinda bland but part of the band with Ritchie - they sure seem a lot like the Archies without Betty and Veronica, I guess that's one reason to get Suzi Quatro into the group. Joanie, originally good as the smaller sister, as she grew into a teenager, the producers tried to put her into romantic roles, but she never did have the charm of a Sally Field as Gidget, A Patty Duke , an Annette Funicello, a Cherly Holdridge as Wally's girlfriend in Leave It To Beaver, but maybe that's just the way I see it.

So the music is gone, making most of these episodes meaningless for the older generation, but as I mentioned before, younger fans will probably not notice. Almost all of the stories center around the Fonz, unlike the earlier years, so basically for me it was too much overkill, I prefer Wonder Years which had stories about all the characters and it was recently announced that the full series, 5 seasons, will be released later this year, so we 'boomers' now have something better to look forward to.",1404432000,4,2082,4.490765171503957
3718842,3,B001NGPLCM,"While the video and audio quality on this set is good, purist fans beware that there are some of the original music during some episodes has been replaced, probably due to song licensing restrictions or the producers of this DVD set didn't want to pay the $$$ to the artists who made the original songs.  But that gripe aside, this is a good, no-frills (no surround sound track or extras) set and it's been long in coming for Happy Days fans.",1404259200,2,442,4.45679012345679

In the episode ""Richie almost dies"" Leather sang a beautiful song while the viewer watched memories of the Richie character, when Richie is in the hospital. In the Season 5 release, the viewer is listening to music not the lyrics . While it is really to bad that the original song isn't heard.. the show is still moving. I think it is GREAT that  Season 5  was still released. While we miss the song, I would miss not having the opportunity to purchase more.

My only complaint is that some of the music is missing. I loved Suzi Quatro and still do. The episode where Richie has the motorcycle accident,Leather plays the piano and sings a beautiful song. Or at least she does on when it plays on tv. On the dvd version,she is just playing the piano. I was upset,as I loved the song and I always cried,right along with the cast. This episode was one of the few that showed Fonzie praying and shedding tears. I do wish these guys would do a reunion show. Now bring on Season 6 !!",1401321600,2,809,4.0
3718850,5,B001NGPLCM,"Finally, CBS releases the fifth season of Happy Days on dvd!  Many criticize this season, but it was still ranked #2 and I can see why, the quality of both the writing and the acting in these episodes is fantastic and the comedy is very strong.  This set contains many fan favourites, including ""Richie Almost Dies"", ""The Fonz and Leather Tuscedaro"", among others. The picture quality is amazing, much like the fourth season release.  CBS even cleared the music rights for most of the songs sung by the actors, so the episodes have complete run times over 25 minutes.  Highly recommended set!",1400889600,2,592,4.7745098039215685
3718851,4,B001NGPLCM,"So there's much ado about the music replacements.  I understand the frustration, but it's also taking away too much from what it is a good release. First and foremost this is not a repeat of season 2. These replacements are chosen well and fit with the period. They also used what was absolutely essential most of Suzi Quatro's (Leather) songs and when the cast themselves sings a song of the day it's mostly there. The episodes themselves look GREAT. Great to see this classic show crystal clear and not the low quality video that been shown in reruns when it airs. Take it from someone who grew up with the show and loves these characters.if you love the show do not cheat yourself out of this release.",1400803200,3,704,4.543307086614173
3718852,1,B001NGPLCM,"I love Happy Days! It's one of the greatest sitcoms made. I can remember being younger when it was on Nick@Nite and recording them to VHS. I suppose I was more of a Fonzie and the Happy Days gang fan than I was a fan of the show being about the 1950s. For me the show doesn't really start going until the third season where Fonzie launches his motorcycle across 14 garbage cans and is sent by ambulance to restore his leg. The fifth season is one the best. It has some of the most memorable episodes in the show. Ironically the Jumping the Shark three-part Hollywood episode is one of the best stories from this season. This is the first season in which the character of Chachi Arcola is introduced; he will later propose and marry Joanie Cunningham in the final episode of the series run. And this is the first season which introduces the character of Leather Tuscadero as played by 70s music icon Suzi Quatro. You can imagine my delight when I first learned that The Complete First Season of Happy Days was to be released to DVD! And then news came that the sales of the first season didn't meet expectations so when they released the second season they replaced all the music to cut costs on the product. And then Season Three and Season Four were released and surprisingly it appeared a lot of the music was kept!

And then came the Fifth Season on DVD. And almost all of the music has been removed! So what happened during the interim? I don't have an answer.

The viewer is lucky enough to watch Anson Williams sing Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow as originally recorded by the Shirelles. Also included are Suzi Quatro's performance of Cat's Eyes, Heartbreak Hotel, and her own song Devil Gate Drive. But don't expect to find intact her performances of Johnny B. Goode by Chuck Berry and the song she composed herself for ABC, Believe, recorded for the episode Richie Almost Dies. With the first song CBS Home Entertainment removed the audio track and replaced it with an instrumental; you see her lips move but you don't hear her voice! With the second song, Believe, CBS removed footage of Suzi at the piano beginning the song and cuts to the montage of footage of Richie involved in various activities; for anyone who has seen this episode and remembers it fondly, this was one of the two emotional climaxes to this plot. Whether CBS recorded an instrumental or they placed an unknown song over the footage cannot be determined as I'm not sure the chord progression I'm hearing is the chord progression to the song. Regardless, the plot now limps along, rendered ineffective. Other songs that have been lifted include ""Blueberry Hill"" by Fats Domino, which Richie makes reference in the episode Hard Copy when he indicates to Lori Beth, his new girlfriend, that Blueberry Hill is his favorite song. Instead we hear a lazy muzak instrumental. Are we hearing flute or saxophone? At this point, we shouldn't care. CBS has done enough damage to an otherwise great season and great show and the only way we can punish a company in the marketplace is to demand a refund or boycott.

I don't understand how so far thirty customers have given this release a five star review. One could argue that they're bigger Happy Days fans than me. Perhaps. But an intolerable offense has been committed. Service rendered is abhorring. And as a customer I demand satisfaction and I am not satisfied. As a customer demanding a product I shouldn't have to be considerate toward the other party in concerning myself with music copyright laws or exorbitant music licensing fees which are beyond my control anyway. Business is suppose to satisfy the customer, not visa versa. There's enough market demand for a release of the Wonder Years and Star Vista Entertainment/Time Life is satisfying that customer demand. Yes, music copyright licensing is a hurdle, but as they've pledged to their customers: they're taking painstaking efforts to secure the music, so the episodes can be enjoyed in their unedited broadcast versions. As they should be. There are even a lot of legality issues that have held up a release of the Batman '66 television series, but it's finally getting a chance to see the light of day! In its entirety! Shout Factory is even releasing WKRP in Cincinatti as a Complete Series set. Mama's Family has been re-released with the original broadcasts. They're re-releasing Married With Children with Frank Sinatra's song. Can you imagine how much that costs? For each episode? CBS has no excuse, therefore, to blame music copyright for these inferior releases; especially when they're a much bigger company than Time Life! I understand that even with a series like China Beach there's going to be songs missing because they couldn't secure them. But Time Life has done a far greater service for China Beach fans than CBS Home Entertainment has done for the fans of Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, Taxi, The Odd Couple, and other shows! Time Life is famous for releasing the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast Specials. Can you imagine the costs it took entailing the release all of those specials? CBS is going to pay for releasing the fifth season in this butchered state. Literally. Oh, it might only be a nick, a penny in the bucket, but I'm sending my DVD set back to Amazon and CBS will have to swallow the cost. CBS shouldn't release any more seasons of Happy Days on DVD. CBS doesn't deserve to release any more seasons of Happy Days. And the only way this message can be conveyed clearly and distinctly is if people vote with their dollar. This vicious cycle of inferior quality releases will only be perpetuated by customers who don't care that they're being disrespected. And those customers are as much responsible for these releases as CBS is in their culpability.

I've contacted Time Life already and requested them to acquire the home video rights to release Happy Days on DVD. I would rather want Time Life over CBS to profit from the sale of Happy Days. Please join me. Call them or contact them on their website and urge them to release this show. Happy Days fans deserve better treatment than this.

8/24/14 EDIT: Three months have since passed since I posted this review and already Amazon does not carry this product anymore. You can still purchase this product from the Amazon website, but you're dealing with a third party seller now.

Meanwhile, Time Life secures the mechanical performance rights to 401 songs for their Wonder Years Complete Series release.

9/03/14 EDIT: Yesterday, news was posted on the website TVShowsonDVD that CBS DVD will be releasing the sixth season of Happy Days. So, therefore, I can only conclude that enough customers bought the fifth season of Happy Days from the retail chains to justify in their minds that they could release the sixth season without losing money. Clearly there hasn't been enough customer outrage translating to profit loss to send CBS DVD a message. The sixth season is where Robin Williams makes his second and final appearance as Mork on Happy Days. Perhaps this release is a ploy to cash in on the man's suicide.",1400803200,14,7084,4.7544715447154475
3718853,3,B001NGPLCM,"Although the picture does look fabulous and there are a lot of episodes I love.... CBS DVD/Paramount has yet again replace most (not all) the original music in the show with generic music.

You still get a few original songs (ex. the songs in the episode ""Be My Valentine"" and a couple of songs sung by Leather Tuscadero, as well as Potsie singing a few songs here and there).

But for the most part it is disappointing regarding the replacement music - especially when a character is singing lyrics to songs (ex. Fonzie singing the lines in ""Cream In My Coffee"" and Postie/Ralph singing a line from ""Tea For Two"").  The worst scene is where Leather (and the band) go through the motions of playing/singing ""Johnny B. Goode"" with a generic instrumental (where Leather is seen moving her mouth to an instrumental!)....

Of course as other reviewer has pointed out - there's only a piano instrumental during the flashback scene in ""Richie's Accident"" instead of Leather singing a touching song (what is the name of this song?)

Overall I'd rate this a C only on the basis that the Music is replaced.  The picture and episodes are still good (and for the most part unedited).....

Providing a none-too-subtle critique on the Fonziemania then certainly sweeping the country, the three-part ""Hollywood"" bluntly warns that todays fads can also vanish as quickly. The cast themselves already understood this and apparently took everything in stride, it was more for the viewing audiences at home. Henry Winkler DID however get to show off his then-favorite sport, waterskiing. And we learn where the now-iconic phrase ""Jump the shark"" came from. Yes, it is this very episode. How is this for enduring pop culture prominence??

We are first introduced to Lori Beth in ""Hard Cover"". Anybody who's a devout fan of the show/grown up with it, knows that the two eventually do marry and have kids. But this is the very first episode where they meet. It is a historic occasion!!  It's also historic because the Fonz getting a library card supposedly made library card registration shoot up big time!!

Another important person we meet is Mork from Ork (Robin Williams) in ""My Favorite Orkan"". Mork and Mindy was actually a spin off of Happy Days and Mork's original mission was to bring back a specimen from 1950's Wisconsin!! Uh-oh. Everybody is very glad Orson gave him another assignment. The original ending of this episode is shown though and the alternate ending later created and reshot is not included as an 'extra' after Mork and Mindy was picked up as it's own distinct series. Rats!!

The series has some stand out episodes which do successfully still place it in a prior era.

Marion and Joanie discover the Feminine Mystique (and the eventual founder of the National Organization for Women) in ""Rules to Date By"" I am sure ""'curfew"" at the University of Wisconsin women's dorm (""Hard Cover"") looks especially awkward today. None of the RHA staff in the dorms I ever stayed in during college even cared if I was in bed.

And a biker accused of snatching a purse is openly treated unfairly by a jury just because of the color of his skin in ""Fonzie for the Defense"". This is especially poignant when the series is supposed to be set during the emerging civil rights movement. As a working-class 'hood' Fonzie has had more regular contact with blacks than the middle-class  Cunninghams. He sees what happens more often than they do. Being on the jury now means that the fictitious character could have a chance to influence others? This influence should then be applied to noble endeavors--but that people will not necessarily listen to him just because he is the Fonz!! This too is another important lesson from the series.

 Richie plays ""woodstein"" and uncovers corruption in his City government for a college journalism assignment (""Nose for News"") years before Watergate!! The college professor is pleased he is not accepting things merely as they seem to be.  Mr. Cunningham blows off the harassment from the City and is very proud of his son.

There are a couple of episodes with Suzi Quatro, who honesty attempted to be Pinky Tuscadero's cousin Leather. She paved the way for other women such as Kathleen Hannah and Courtney Love  But during these episodes she frequently came across as a cross between late- life Elvis and Marie Osmond. The wardrobe was obviously a producer decision and not hers. She had to accept it to get ANY role whatsoever promoting herself as a singer on  this particular television series. She looks visibly uncomfortable with the Dallas Cowgirl cheerleader backup singers. It's not her at all.

I really feel for her, they did not know how to successfully integrate a 'recurring' sexy female singer character into what had then become a blockbuster family phenomenon.  Having her run around in leather and tight pants herself acting like a hood was now not going to work.  She needed to go onto another show--or even a bit part on a movie. Just anything else anywhere else would have been an improvement for her career.  .

The only glaring flaw with this set (and the reason for the minus one star) is that its also the season with Chachi introduced too. This was the era of 'big three' and the writers were supposed to know how to readily entertain entire families. They did not need a little kid tagging after Fonzie and the college kids he gave advice to. It was annoying then and it's stupid now. Shame that the DVD does not have a feature to delete Scott Baio from episodes!!.",1514160000,2,4388,4.818908122503329

8326993,4,B001NGPLCM,"This is the season that started with the 3-part episode from which the expression ""jumped the shark"" originated, in which Richie and Fonzie are called to Hollywood for a screen test for ""the next James Dean"", only to have Richie get the contract offer when the moguls decide they suddenly prefer ""disturbed apple pie faces""--not one of my favorites, but it had some good points.  It also features probably my all-time favorite episode, ""Richie Almost Dies"" (wherein he buys a motorcycle and has a nearly-fatal accident)--notable for being the Only Episode Ever to show Fonzie crying, when he visits Richie in the hospital, realizes he's in serious danger of death and has a conversation with God asking Him to save Richie, in a beautiful and very well-acted scene by Henry Winkler.  To me, that episode alone was worth the price of the DVD set.  (It also marks the first season they start bringing in new characters, at least one to be recurring, although the less said about them, the better--I really don't care for Pinky Tuscadero or her little sister Leather.  And BTW, if you do, be prepared to *not* hear the lyrics for most of her songs. Not sure why...I assume there was some copyright issue or something.)",1507334400,,1214,4.794258373205742
