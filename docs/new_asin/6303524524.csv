Being repetitive, because in some respects the same can be said of every Red Shoe Diaries story, if you want only eye-candy go elsewhere and enjoy. If you want eye-candy (always), mind-candy (often), skilled actors (always) and easy-to-hear music, try one. Then try to stay out of bed.
In the stories in this movie, I see people dealing with strongly-felt needs to face life alone.
Early in the first story, Double or Nothing, you hear the words ""Risk all to gain all."" A woman who'd chosen between hustling her body or hustling pool battles her own past and a male pool hustler to find self-respect. The first time I viewed it I wasn't prepared for its intensity and disliked it. It's now my favorite of these three.
In the second story, Bounty Hunter, a woman is hired to find a fugitive. She finds him and both a contest of wills and a surprise ending follows.
In the third story, Weekend Pass,...gee, I could say more than that in the military (the U. S. Army here) some things have changed since my time in the then-all-male Navy and some things haven't. View the movie.",999302400,11,1112,4.565
