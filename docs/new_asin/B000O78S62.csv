8183990,5,B000O78S62,"This dvd has got:
1. ""Spring Nicht"" video(""Don't Jump"" but in the original German song), 2. making of the video (great rare footage) 3. two live-acoustic-in-the-studio performances caught on camera, 4. an inside tour of the TH studio by Tom & Bill!!
The only minus for international fans is that there are no subtitles, neither for hearing impaired people or for non-German spoken audiences :(",1229904000,,393,5.061538461538461
8183991,5,B000O78S62,"Yes, the DVD is all in German, no subtitles, but that shouldn't hold fans back. Great DVD includes the Spring Nicht video and awesome bonus material, including the Making Of, a couple of unplugged videos, and a segment of Bill and Tom giving a tour of the recording studio. I'm in the US, and this DVD plays fine on my laptop and XBOX 360.",1224979200,3,339,4.3125
8183992,5,B000O78S62,"These 4 guys, 2 of them twins, are the hottest and fastest rising German group in Europe.  They are so hot that they have virtually taken all of that continent over by ""monsoon"" and that even includes all of France!  Their music is fresh, clean, and hopeful, but best of all they are a great rock band.  Their music is awesome in both German and English although I'm getting off on the German music more than the English even thought I don't understand German (except what I've learned listening to TH).  This DVD (of mine) is PAL (non playable in US) so most US should get it in NTSC. Be aware that this DVD is entirely in German.  This young group is already very polished.  5 stars all the way.  This is one Hawaii fan that could only wish they'd come here.  THEY ROCK!",1188086400,8,772,4.3125
