4710851,5,B005J29LBS,"What a stunning cast, and what a naked film, literally and figuratively. A movie about a mother and a daughter and about a father and a daughter, and a most peculiar young man. A film full of poignance, love, sensuality, fragility -- unconditional love gone awry. I've seen many of the actors on the NY stage and their heady accomplishments in the theatre are exceeded here. Jonathan Groff was the star of ""Spring Awakening,"" Reed Birney in ""Blasted,"" and Barbara Barrie in ""Company."" And Mamie Gummer, Meryl Streep's daughter, proves that talent is indeed inherited. I had no idea who Portia Reiners was but boy is she a gem and, holy smokes, the camera adores her.  Check it out.  It's a winner.  Some of the most intelligent dialog I've heard in a movie for a very long time.",1405468800,2,778,4.6231884057971016
4710852,3,B005J29LBS,Bought it for a Jonathan Groff collection I have going. The story is interesting and characters engaging. It has the look of a school project.,1400198400,,142,4.72
4710853,5,B005J29LBS,"its a good movie. i recommend this movie. Mamie Gummer is a good actress and shines as a good actress, she's the daughter of actress,Meryl Streep, both are good actress's, both are talented, both are creative, both are star's in there own way as they shine through their role's in acting from their movie's.
its a good movie.",1378080000,,325,4.620689655172414
4710854,1,B005J29LBS,basically the whole movie was just a black screen but a bit of the beginning and a bit of the end.,1372809600,,98,3.7142857142857144
4710855,3,B005J29LBS,"saw this movie in a screening in which the director Jeff Lipsky was present ad discussed the movie in length afterward. It is a fascinating, left of centre far out art house movie with its own challenges. Jonathan Groff shows he is an interesting film actor with much more to offer than the rather trivial performances he gives on ""Glee"". He is also a very brave actor partaking in several sex scenes including a very exposing full frontal nude scene and an even more explicit scene with the older Karen Young. Its good to see a young actor fearlessly work in a movie like this and to be unafraid of what he is asked to do by the director.

There was much discussion after the film about whether the director knew about Groff's being the innocent victim of a slur by a  journalist who commented that gay actors cant play straight (Groff is out gay and a journo had a swipe at him during the early ""Glee""episodes for his playing straight). It was a needless and ridiculous slur , Groff is a fine actor who can play gay or straight I(as he does here) very effectively. Though far from a perfect film, it's one thatis definitely worth a watch.",1330905600,15,1140,4.44976076555024

8475332,1,B005J29LBS,"What a way to waste good talent. A dull, dreary screenplay filled with all the usual stereotypes and gratuitous nudity. Some of the dialog these actors signed on to deliver is nothing short of moronic and in language I can not repeat here. Frankly, I pay to be entertained. This ain't it. Save not just your money, but your time.",1427587200,,329,4.5
