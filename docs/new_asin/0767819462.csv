10728,5,0767819462,"(spoilers)  For a movie with a schlock quotient this high (Julia Roberts teaching step daughter to be cool, Susan Sarandon dancing wildly to Marvin Gaye in pajamas with her two children), this movie nonetheless achieves a breathtaking and memorable level of honesty, in a few, very few, but amazingly poignant scenes.  To wit -- the scene where Ed Harris brings the dying Susan Sarandon a christmas tree, long after they have separated.  The scene which Julia Roberts confronts Susan Sarandon with some evidence of her duplicity and challenges her to obtain the truth:  ""Are you dying/"" and Susan Sarandon  looks her straight in the eye and says ""Not today.""  Those two words have become a kind of personal mantra for my husband and me, and in my estimation, this mere chickflick has approached the epitome of unsentimental veracity, for a few moments only, but what moments! --These few scenes rescue the movie from the heap of  terminal illness schlock.  I almost hate to admit it, but based on these few scenes alone this movie ranks with my top ten all time . . . . (and I admit I am a sucker for nearly anything with Ed Harris in it.)",1412899200,,1139,4.66

10731,5,0767819462,"This touching story has funny moments, inspiring moments, and moments that bring tears to your eyes. Thousands of viewers can relate to the heartfelt story, especially in today's world, where children have relationships with parents, and step-parents. Susan Sarandon plays the role of a divorced mom, who devotes most of her time to her children, portrayed as a caring, and loving parent. Her ex-husband is Ed Harris, who is involved in a serious relationship with another woman. Julia Roberts plays the role of the other woman. When the two women first meet, they don't agree on much, and there is obvious resentment of the manner in which they both have different point of views in dealing with the children.

Susan Sarandon eventually has no choice, but to let her ex-husband and his new love know that she has cancer, and time is not on her side. As time passes, the two women try to be more compassionate for the peace and tranquility of the family, as they try to understand each other. This uplifting story tugs at the heart, and Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon give outstanding Acting Performances. A movie that grabs your attention in the very beginning, and keeps you there. Inspiring, emotional, and heartfelt. Highly recommended!",1411862400,,1242,4.942583732057416

But this is still a great movie as its leads bring their characters to life on the screen, allowing us to sympathize with their troubles...and perhaps choose sides in their disagreements.  Susan Sarandon, Ed Harris, and Julia Roberts are involved in a triangle as they work to adjust to one couple's divorce and the other's pending nuptials.  The child actors, Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, were also great as the kids not happy with any part of the situations.  These kids were given distinct personalities and each one made the absolute most with what they had...job well done.  Sure, the ending was totally sad and corny all at once, but it worked so well that I won't complain...instead, I'll credit the cast for making it work so well.

But this is so much better. Great score and Chris Columbus, director of Home Alone, Harry Potter 1 & 2's best work too. A great collaboration of everything, a masterpiece.

10794,4,0767819462,"It is hard to believe that this film is 15 years old now: it is as fresh  and refreshing as the year it was made. Much of that is due to the story that tends to be a bit Hallmarky (written by Gigi Levangle and manipulated for the screen by Jessie Nelson, Steven Rogers, Karen Leigh Hopkins and Ronald Bass) but with Chris Columbus' direction and a cast of incredibly talented actors is really works.

Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken), the two children of Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) Harrison, have to cope with the fact that their parents divorced and that there is a new woman in their father's life: Isabel (Julia Roberts), a successful photographer. She does her best to treat the kids in a way that makes them still feel at home when being with their dad, but also loves her work and does not plan to give it up. But Jackie, a full-time mother, regards Isabel's efforts as offensively insufficient. She can't understand that work can be important to her as well as the kids. The conflict between them is deepened by the sudden diagnose of cancer, which might may be deadly for Jackie. They all have to learn a little in order to grow together.

The lightness of the film is highlighted with some very entertaining Karaoke takes on popular music as performed by mom and the kids and by a little Thanksgiving talent show.  But over and above the cutesy schmaltz are a lot of well shaped statements about life and death and family.  It remains a very fine movie. Grady Harp, May 13",1367539200,2,1506,4.481751824817518

For all those who felt sorry for the mother, remember they pointed out SHE kicked HIM out for working so hard, and of course the houses that both live in are fantasy places that only multimillionaires could afford.  But there you go--if you are going to get this rich you have to work around the clock, it's just a fact of life.  It comes down to two women who were excellent in their roles and I loved the fact that the director forced us to feel annoyed and love both characters in their own way.  It's really well worth picking up at a garage sale or renting from the library.  The kids played brilliantly and I am truly surprised that they did not become stars as adults.  For all of you who complained that the 12 year old girl was annoying, you must not be around 12 year old girls.

Julia Roberts, naturally, is very good to look at, Susan Sarandon is not bad either; despite this, they play the parts of the wife-to-be and the ex-wife excellently. The modern, hip, touch is that the wife-to-be is living with the ex-husband and husband to be, Ed Harris, in the role of step mom to his children, who, in the course of the things, will become her step-children.  Ed Harris, manages to keep smiling ,playing fifth significant person to the two women and, in point of fact, to his 12 year old daughter and ca, 8 year old son. This is the kind of film in which men are just a backdrop to the two women (as in the days of Davis and Hopkins).
The film goes on too long for what it has to say, becoming tedious by the Christmas Day ending. Whether it will seem tedious to viewers who like this sort of thing, I cannot say.

At certain points in the film (yeah, like half of it) the waterworks start - I have to keep a box of Kleenex VERY handy.

The reviewer who gave one star and titled their review ""Boring"" must have a heart made of stone (with a knowledge of usage and vocabulary to match).

Highly recommended, insanely entertaining.  Yes, Susan Sarandon does walk away with the movie.  But that's not to discount the performances of Julia Roberts and Ed Harris, and of the children, Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, and in a smaller role, Lynn Whitfield as the oncologist.

10821,4,0767819462,"Having recently lost a parent, I found this film very moving.  It is mature in that it isn't some silly thing about removing the barriers to falling in love - by far the easiest part - but in how to move on after a divorce.  The actors are extremely fine, and their characters evolve throughout the entire film:  the left-over mom is angry, the stepmom is a rather hard-edged career woman, and the kids are expressing pain and hostility in their own way.  Happily, the husband is not a simple jerk, but a guy working very hard to help everyone along the way to whatever comes next.  The way that they all adapt is entirely believable, bringing a realism that you rarely see in love films, and this is surely about love.

Unfortunately, there are certain scenes that don't quite ring true to me, in particular those involving the kids and their rock.  The siblings get on way too well, in particular the young son is way too accommodating and nice.  But overall, it is done with sensitivity, funny without being a comedy, and sad without being a melodrama.

In order to melt this emotional iceberg, Roberts who is a successful professional photographer, will have to fight very hard to occupy her own place in the new state of things.

With all these available dramatic premises, the expectations were too high. But the screenwriters bet for a tearful approach in the third movement of the play when a sudden twist of fate will intend to make us aware about the importance of the familiar values, above any serious conceptual difference between the new visitor and the original mother.

""Step Mom"" is one of her best films.  I'm not really a big Susan Sarandon fan but she was good in this movie.  It revolves around the lives of the step mother conflcting with the mother from the previous marriage.  The kids in this movie help liven up the movie and unfortunately haven't been in any big name future films since.  Jackie ends up getting cancer later in the movie which will bring tears to your eyes in some scenes.  Isabel (Julia Roberts) is pretty much an artsy photographer who is considered ""hip"" by Jackie, the mother of the children.  They have to put up with Isabel's poor motherhood instincts like accidentally ""losing"" one of the children in one scene.  Later in the movie you grow to like both mothers.  Even the father Luke gets likeable later in the movie as his character becomes more real.  The cast of the movie is pretty talented.  This is one of the better films Julia Roberts has been in.  While ""The Pelican Brief"" is my all-time favorite of hers, ""Stepmom"" is still worth watching even though it's an older movie.

10832,5,0767819462,"Photographer Isabel Kelly (Julia Roberts) steps into the role of Stepmom when she moves in with her older boyfriend, Luke Harrison (Ed Harris). He has two children, a young boy named Ben (Liam Aiken) and a teenage girl named Anna (Jena Malone), with his ex-wife Jackie (Susan Surandon).

Jackie does everything she can to undermine the kids relationship with Isabel short of coming out and telling them to hate her. But it is implied. When she finds out that her breast cancer has returned she's worried about the kind of mother she's leaving her kids with. It comes down to deciding if she's going to continue to sabotage Isabel or help her to be the best Stepmom she can be.

Surandon is inspirational as the grief stricken mom trying to drink up every blessed moment she has left with her children while leaving them with fond memories of their mother. This film is a roller coaster of emotions: love, jealousy, hate, anger, regret, loss and so much more is portrayed within a few hours.

This is one of my favorite dramatic comedy films starring two of my favorite female lead actresses. It makes me laugh and cry every time I see it. This film is so relevant to today's families showing that children and parents don't have to choose sides and that all members can have an enriched involvement if everyone chooses to give a little, accept one another's uniqueness and realize that life is a rocky road no matter who you love.

The little boy broke my heart when he had his last talk with his mom (Susan Sarandon).  Basically, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris are an item and his ex is Sarandon.  His kids don't like Julia, Julia and Susan don't like each other, but through predictability, a personal tragedy brings them all together (as you can imagine).  So apart from the predictabilitly, this is an excellent film that will make you laugh, cry and bawl.

New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other ... the end. Nothing like a convenient disease-of-the-week solution in lieu of a well-written, plausible resolution to the conflict. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade.

When watching this film, I will agree that many, if not most, of the plot is totally predictable.  You might see things coming from early on.  But this doesn't steal from the fact that Julia and Susan are wonderful actresses, with a wealth of facial expressions and sublties that make them all the more captivating to watch.  Ed Harris doesn't do much more than stand around here, unfortunately.  He has one moving scene, where the emotion seems real, but the tears are fake, yet we still root for him as the dad and ex-husband caught in the middle.  You can really see him act in The Truman Show and The Hours, where he steps up to the plate to deliver extraordinary performances.  Then of course, Step Mom was directed by Chris Columbus and when I see his name on a film I know I'm going to enjoy it...Harry Potter, Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Nine Months, and the list goes on.

Ed Harris, Susan Sarandon & Julia all do extremely well in this, as do the kids. Jena Malone plays the little girl, and Liam Aiken (Object Of My Affection, Sweet November) plays her younger brother.

I have to say this movie makes me cry every single time. And once you've seen the movie once, you'll start crying earlier & earlier in the movie each time. It's amazing.

Julia & Susan work so well on this film together, that I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. Their love/hate relationship is so good, you actually believe it. The cold stares (something Susan's fabulous at!) make you shiver. And the crying, god, as soon as they start, that's me. Watch out for the conversation about the wedding, if that doesn't get you going nothing will.

Should be understood that this screenplay was originally written by real-life stepmom Gigi Levangie. I think Gigi had an agenda to push. For once I'd like to see Hollywood come out with a film that sings the praises of original moms, not younger-model girlfriends, and makes these original moms the attractive, healthy, mentally-sound very cool and sexy women they often are in real life. Let's give them the happy ending--they make the world go round!

10847,4,0767819462,"'Stepmom' takes on an emotional journey through the lives of 5 people, 3 adults and 2 children.  Though I found this movie moving, emotional and at times fun, it lacks in truth.  Considering I've been through a divorce with my parents and my father remarried, I know how it is, somewhat.  I know it isn't the same for everyone but I get the jist of it.  As always, Susan Sarandon is infectious (no pun intended), she's one of the most brilliant actresses alive, maybe ever.  Julia Roberts is tough and upfront while Ed Harris shows an emotional, quieter character who doesn't have as much film time as he should.

The two children, Sarandon's and Harris' children are played extremely well.  For their ages, they act similar to what would happen.  The younger boy doesn't feel much different except asks 'mommy, if you want me to hate her [meaning Julia Roberts], I will' - typical for a young boy to side with his mother but also not be angry at the other woman in his fathers life only because he doesn't quite understand yet.  The daughter however is like pin point.  She's angry and doesn't seem to give Isabelle [Roberts] a chance.  When Isabelle brings home a puppy to try and win her love, she exclaims she's allergic to dogs but is actually lying.  She doesn't want Isabelle to think she is giving her any part of her.  She ""hates"" her.  The movie is mainly focused on how Anna hates Isabelle and how they bond.  The unrealistic part is how Roberts character and Sarandon's character coexist towards the end.  I'm not saying it could never happen but it's a little over the top.  In all, this is a good family film, a good movie for people going through that type of situation, I somewhat wished I had seen it before or while I was going through the same thing.",1094256000,4,1769,4.512578616352202

The movie explores the challenges of the children to accept a new authority figure, Isabelle's search for her role in the broken family, Luke's struggles in determining his responsibilities to both his fiancee Isabelle and ex-wife Jackie, and Jackie's challenges to let a new woman into the lives of her children.

Now if you haven't fainted at the sheer horror of that concept, you will when you realise the dullness of it's plot. Super hag doesn't get on with her boyfriends ex wife, then the ex-wife dies, the end. BORING.

set mainly in the city of New York,this is one of the first films to show the pain and jealousy involved when you divorce,and your ex finds someone else,especially when children are involved and expected to treat their father's new girlfriend as if she were their mum,(which happens all the time in real-life).
  The only bad thing I can say about this movie is the complete lack of suspence,and action. There is virtually no action,mostly sad,hurtful scenes with lots of realistic looking tension between the leads.whilst I say there isn't much action and suspence,the suprises and shocks all through this movie,more than make up for it.

10853,1,0767819462,"Stepmom (Chris Columbus, 1998)
It's probably considered at least a venial sin in America to criticize Columbus, who's bookended his directorial career with two of the biggest blockbusters ever to hit a big screen, Home Alone and the Harry Potter franchise. But let's face it. Home Alone was pure unadulterated emotionally manipulative schlock. The guy's made his mark directing the kinds of teen comedies John Hughes wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole (and Hughes even wrote Home Alone. One wonders why he didn't direct...). With Stepmom, Columbus has all the schlock with none of the cuteness of the child actors. Not that said cuteness ever made his films watchable previously.
There is only one actress in Hollywood who can make Julia Roberts look like she can act, and that is the detestable Susan Sarandon. While Sarandon has been nausea-inducing in a number of roles, this one goes above and beyond the call of duty. Sarandon's character, Jackie Harrison, is the ex-wife of hapless Luke (Ed Harris, showing once and for all that no matter how good an actor you are, if the script makes you look like an idiot, you will look like an idiot). She can't stand Luke's new girlfriend, Isabel (Roberts), and for that matter can't seem to stand much of anyone, including her own kids. Jackie is as loathsome a creature as the average viewer, and most non-average viewers, will ever want to meet. Were she male, she'd be on the Lifetime Movie network in a wifebeater T-shirt, throwing beer cans at the football game and smacking the kids around, and everyone would hate her. But she's female, and she's in a Chris Columbus movie, and so we're supposed to sympathize. (Oh, and to make sure we do, not far into the film she's diagnosed with cancer. Because that's an excuse to be [a jerk].)
Julia Roberts has only managed one decent role in her career, and that (Flatliners) lay in the strength of the rest of the cast. The fact that she can be singled out here because of the weakness of the cast around her says volumes. I could easily go on for another half-hour about the painfully overdramatized script, the shameless attempts at emotional manipulation throughout, the pedestrian camerawork, and the fact that, even though he's working with adults, Chris Columbus is still directing teen feel-good-because-everyone-bonds movies. But there are so many more deserving things to give bad reviews to out there I can't justify spending any more time on this painfully bad piece of dreck. (zero)",1044748800,6,2490,4.888888888888889

Divorce is not an easy matter and remarrying is even more difficult for the children. But a stepmom has to learn how to become and be a real mother, has to learn how to capture the children's attention, interest and trust. This is done especially because the real mother has cancer and is going to die. When she realises this she stops fighting and helps the stepmom to be accepted by the kids because she has to give way to her since she is going to go and leave forever. The relation between the two mothers, the real one and the step one, is explored in great details and is very convincing. The kids are also very good and full of feeling and true emotion. The father is mostly on the sideline and certainly not the center of the film, but after all the stepmother is the star, the stepmother who is being born little by little. Emotions and feelings are uppermost in this film that becomes some entertaining and also thought bringing two hours.

10855,5,0767819462,"Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon truly give life to this remarkable tale of family, life, love, and loss. Director Chris Columbus (Harry Potter, Mrs. Doubtfire) superbly directs the well-defined script that not once questions its ability to work. Though an intelligent group of screenwriters and a good director are behind the film, it definitely reflects the typical Hollywood-tear jerker, but with quality.
The film focuses on the Harrison family: Luke (Ed Harris), Jackie (Susan Sarandon), and their two children Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken). The wealthy New York family has all of the love, but all of the fights, especially those which have come from Luke and Jackie's past divorce. Luke's new love interest, and fianc, is Isabel (Julia Roberts), a stylish, young, New York City photographer. She has absolutely no motherly experience, and is really not ready to be a stepmom, especially since the two children are indisputably close to their very maternal mother Jackie. From this, a slight feud between Jackie and Isabel comes about. Isabel is unhappy of how Jackie sees her as so irresponsible and careless, while Jackie is not ready to be replaced by someone with no parental experience. But after the family learns devastating news concerning Jackie's health, Isabel and Jackie must learn to get along, whether they are going to share motherhood or not.
Though there are some smiles and heart-filled scenes, the emotional and dramatic script offers a typical family drama story, in which a family is sometimes torn apart by the horrible consequences that life brings sometimes, and the difficulty of changes. Fortunately, the story plays out well with great direction, two amazing lead-female stars (also with executive producer spots), and a plot that keeps the audience emotionally attached throughout the film.
Malone and Aiken impress, as the emotionally hurt children that are suffering from their parents past divorce, while they must cope with Isabel, their soon to be stepmom. And despite some mild film-making don'ts, STEPMOM has few flaws, and truly shows us how ""family"" is more than just a word.

Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon were outstanding choices for the lead roles because they truly knew how to fit the types of characters they were playing. Susan Sarandon is Jackie Harrison, a highly devoted mother who is an outstanding example of a woman who loves and places her children above herself. Her ex-husband Luke (Ed Harris) finds a new love, Isabel (Julia Roberts). The whole situation is difficult for Jackie and both of her young children, especially her 12-year-old daughter Anna, who resents Isabel. When Susan is diagnosed with fatal cancer, it becomes absolutely necessary for the two kids to learn to accept Isabel. Many, many hardships and challenges rise between Susan and Isabel before they are finally able to put aside their differences, become friends, and figure out how to handle the future of their family--a future that they can no longer deny. I especially liked this movie because it deals with such serious and complex issues that many of us can at least appreciate if we have not experienced it ourselves. You really feel the tone of the issue through Anna, Susan's oldest child. She is such a horrible brat, you want to kick her, but then you soften when you realize that she is just scared and upset because she loves both of her parents, and it is hard for her to get through all of the changes. Any of us can understand or even relate to that. Although I enjoyed most aspects of this movie, I really loved the way Susan taught her children not to be afraid of her death, especially her very young son. There's no greater way to show your love for your child than by putting on a brave face during the scariest moment of your life in order to spare them the fear that you feel yourself. It truly is touching the way Susan loves her kids so selflessly in this movie. It's very deep, very moving, and worth the money to buy.

She dotes on her kids to a fault, keeps up the 3 story Victorian house all by herself, is smart and funny.  So I guess the only reason her husband didn't want her anymore is because she grew older.  But at least they still can be friends.  Hell, he even went out and bought a lid of grass for her to help with the cancer treatment.  I hate the depiction of father is suppose to be spending time with the kids and they are being taken care of by the fiance'.  Dad has to go to work, well doesn't she?

Definitely a great movie, but make sure you have plenty of tissues, because you will cry!",1016323200,4,435,4.2560975609756095
10862,2,0767819462,"This is a movie about unfulfilled hopes of love, desperation of middle age, loneliness of dying, and destroyed childhoods. It's also a movie about responsibility and lack of such.  What a potential for a real drama. But no, they had to make everybody so sweet, so wonderful that I had to go eat an anchovy.
 So start with the father:

 An aging affluent lawer brings home to live with him and his two young children a girl almost half his age. She is neither a wife nor is there any talk about marriage at that time. The children are confused about her role in their father's life. The little boy asks his father why his dad and mom got divorced. Dad's answer is remarkable: ""because daddy doesn't love mommy any longer"". Then he changes it to a ""better"" answer: ""daddy loves mommy, but not that way"". How caring!

 Dad is really great. He loves his girlfriend ""that way"". Passions are so great that the two lovers forget to close the door while they love each other ""that way"". Unfortunately (or fortunately) we were not privileged to see Ed Harris making love to Julia Roberts in the bathroom but his daughter was. But it's ok. the mother doesn't mind. To take the children from their irresponsible father would be too damaging. Really....

 There is no sex in this movie because of its rating, but the ideas are much more damaging for the young mind.

 At this point the makers of the movie decided that it was not fair to blame everything on poor Ed Harris. So they create a scene where the mother accuses the dad of leaving her, his response is interesting: "" You were the one who threw me out of this house two years ago"". Aha! It's all her falt! Interesting, what did he do in order to be thrown out of the house by the woman who had quit her career years ago in order to dedicate herself to her children and this man?

 Anyway... When the children's misery and hatred to their so called stepmom reaches its maximum the wise dad decides that it would be an appropriate moment to propose to Julia Roberts. Julia Roberts, God bless her, can't wait to marry this older man with a bunch of hating children and alimony payments. It's ok that the dad is almost never there and the poor girlfriend has to take care of the brats almost full time (Can't they hire a babysitter?). Note that she is not a gold digger, she herself is a high-paid rising-star photographer. There is nothing in the movie that explains this girl's attraction to this man. Ed Harris, who has an ability as an actor to develop a complex, emotionally intense, charismatic character ( See ""The Third Miracle"" - a much better movie), did nothing for this role.

 Now, there is the mother. She is dying of cancer, but being a proud person she doesn't want her ex and children to know about it. Or may be this is the fear that as soon as the pack of wolves smells her weakness she will be stomped all over. And sure enough,  as soon as they accidentally find out about her illness, the children start treating their mother as if she is already dead. This is turning point for them to start looking to accepting Julia Roberts as their next mother. And at this point they find out that she is actually fun. She doesn't listen to ""boring"" classic music as their mother (a big plus), she is a little bit trashy (definitely a big plus), she is young and healthy (unlike their old and sick scary mother). Most importantly, they don't have to rise to the higher moral standard this family once had.

  Ed Harris, give him credit, a ""wonderful"" man, promises the mother that ""she won't go through this (chemotherapy, radiation, death) alone"". From this moment, as was said in another review, Ed Harris mysteriously disappears. Except for one ""act of kindness"" when he bought a Christmas tree for his children that is. Susan Sarandon is devastated by the loss of first her husband, then her children and now she has only a few weeks to live. Apparently she doesn't have any other friends or family except somewhere in CA where she goes to smoke medicinal dope (is this a plug?).
Before that she is mostly by herself in a huge house. The children are with the girlfriend. The ex is busy making money. Her suffering is intolerable.

  Remarkably, none of these ""wonderful"" people feels generous enough to come to her and give this pretty much discarded woman a big hug and say the words that have to be said. There is nothing to fight about anymore: the mother lost and the girlfriend achieved the status of top female in the pack. Ed Harris is missing until the movie's budget ran out and they had to make a final Christmas scene. He suddenly appears in the end and acts so we all hope that his mid-life crisis is over. Julia turns from an annoying moron into a relatively mature individual, the mother forgives everybody, and the children are happy, because though their mother is dying , there will finally be clarity about who is who, and no need to go from one house to another every couple of days. As I said, there is nothing to fight about. The mother will be dead in a few weeks. She lost and she knows this, so she tries to make her children remember her as a nice person.

 Julia won (how could she not?). By the way, the children hug their mother finally in the last scene.

Ed Harris is concerned who is going to take care of children when Julia is at work. Luckily Julia is happy to quit her high-paying glamorous job to raise Ed's children.

  I wonder if she can have her job back when Ed decides he doesn't love her ""that way"" any longer?

The only character that was marginally believable was Sarandon's as a mother battling the fears of losing her children to the trophy wife. The rest of the characters were very uninteresting. I think the screenwriter and director should have done better step-parenting research. It would have done them wonders to log on to any number of newsgroups to get a feel for what real step families go through. The characters in this movie weren't real. I was very disappointed.
The rest of the movie was bland, boring, and frankly, unbelievable. I mean, what mother can afford to take a child out on a twilight horse ride on a moments notice? And where, pray tell, is this fantastic New York suburb Sarandon lived in that afforded her pastoral views of mountains and woods? Did anyone miss the fact the Roberts worked in NYC and was mysteriously able to pick-up the stepkids at their birthday parties and schools in this lush suburb? Sorry, I grew up in that area of the East Coast and I'm still guessing where this suburb is.
Find something better to do with 2 hours. If your really want to watch an excellent movie about the horrors and nuances of divorce see 1982's ""Shoot The Moon"" with Albert Finney and Diane Keaton. Now that was a good movie.",1003190400,4,1324,4.638297872340425
10865,5,0767819462,"My mother and I watched this together on a Saturday night.  We ended up sobbing by the end of this movie.  It was very realistic.  This movie potrays the family as they handle Jackie being diagnosed with cancer and the workings of a new family so well.  You could relate to the part of Isabel as the girlfriend and new stepmom with two kids who dislike you immensely, no matter how hard you tried, and always compared you to their mother.  And she also showed how difficult it is for the new wife to have two step-kids who will always hold their mother on the highest pedstal of love and perfection.  Susan Sarandon gave a beautiful and emotional performance.  She played Jackie, the mother.  My mother and I could relate to how she felt about having her part as Mother and Sole Protector of her children usurped by this younger, beautiful, working girl.  The young actors playing Ben and Anna gave a perfect performance as well.  The actor playing Ben portrayed his part as young, happy-go-lucky kid, who will always love his mother, so well.  The part where he said to his mother, ""Mom, if you want me to hate her, I will."" was so heart-wrenching.  It showed his love for his mother.  Anna played the part of the pre-teen who was going to go through her life withouth her mother so well.  The conversations near the end with Ben and Anna with Jackie brought on sobs.  Ed Harris also gave a good performance as the husband who tried to make the marriage work, but couldn't and now realizes, his first wife is dying.  This movie deserves an oscar, five stars, and a box of tissues.  I suggest you watch it with someone you really care about, a parent, aunt, grandparent, etc.  We tried watching it with Dad, but he didn't get it.  He made comments about the beautiful leaves in the fall scenes, and than left until the movie was over and came back again when we put in a Jackie Chan movie.  But this movie is a must see.

10872,4,0767819462,"I actually got this DVD, plus four others, for free! It was part of a special deal that I got with the purchase of my Toshiba DVD player.  It sat around my house for a few months before I finally opened it and played it.  I had been a little reluctant to see it because, even though it stars one of my favorite actresses--Susan Sarandon, it looked like a stereotypical oversentimentalized ""chick flick."" I was pleasantly surprised.
There is not one false note in this movie.  The screenplay, courtesy of a whopping FIVE writers (which usually spells disaster for most movies), sticks very close to reality.  We get a sense that these characters are three-dimensional and REAL, and not merely functions of the plot.  The tension between the estranged wife (played by Sarandon) and the title character (played by Julia Roberts) is palpable and believable, with no one being made the saint nor the villian.  These characters have virtues and faults just like anybody else. They also have clear reasons and MOTIVATIONS for the way they feel, and for the things they do.  Ed Harris, as the man standing between the woman he loves and the woman he once loved (and still cares very much for), also rings true in his performance and makes us feel the inner tensions felt by his character.  I even liked the two young actors playing the kids, and the way their parts were written: these are real kids with real feelings and emotions, and are not just there to look and act cute.  They are caught in an uncomfortable situation not of their making, and we really feel for them.
Although the last half-hour does reflect certain conventions of Hollywood dramas (""Terms of Endearment"" comes to mind, a little bit anyway), STEPMOM never falls into cliche` territory.  It deals with the situation bravely, and doesn't lose its step.  By the end of the film, I felt like I knew these characters and cared about them, because they contained aspects of real people I have known.
Basically, if you like to watch a good family-centered drama every once in a while, then I definitely recommend this movie.  It is definitely better than most others of its type.",989971200,3,2138,4.717741935483871
10873,5,0767819462,"STEPMOM is one of my favorite movies of all time!! It puts together comady, romance, drama, and family all in one two hour movie!!
STEPMOM stars Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon. They're best friends in real life, but for this movie, they can't stand being near each other!!
Julia plays Isabel, a very hip, kid-like woman who is in love with Luke. Luke is Jackie's ex-husband, who is played by Susan. So therefore, Isabel must take care of Jackie and Luke's two children, Ben and Anna.
The only problem is, Anna hates Isabel, and so Isabel gets annoyed. She doesn't seen to fit in. Especially when Jackie takes a dislike to her, also.

10874,4,0767819462,"Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon light up the screen in ""Stepmom,"" a heartwarming and emotionally involving comedy/drama which tells the story of two women, one divorced, the other married to her ex-husband, and the hurdles they must jump in order to find a common ground of understanding. The movie has it laughs, tears, and an upbeat attitude that keeps going throughout, telling its story in an appealing fashion with the help of its brilliant cast and director Chris Columbus. You can enjoy this movie for everything it has to offer and feel satisfied in the end with how you spent your time; I did.
Jackie and Luke are divorced, which is emotionally taxing on their two children, Anna and Ben, Anna refusing to accept the fact that her parents are never getting back together again. Ben is too young to understand much of what is going on; he merely aides Anna in making Luke's girlfriend, Isabel, completely miserable. This includes hounding her for unwashed laundry, putting down her lunches, and just about anything they can to make it look like they have been treated with less care than they would under their mother. The movie's setup of these relationships between different characters is well-done, keeping its focus on the children's actions and their feelings on the situations they are put into.
As most ex-wives will do, Jackie is condescending of Isabel, looking down on her as a self-centered woman who cares more for her work and personal life than for the children under her care. They have many sparring sessions and heated arguments, but it's clear that they cannot argue forever, and as the children begin to warm to Isabel, so does the friendship between Jackie and Isabel begin to form. Soon, they are helping each other through tough times, trading tips on caring for the children, but still maintaining that small spark of conflict which will surface time and again as Jackie realizes her children are no longer solely under her influence.
The movie deals with a lot of real-to-life family issues that will hit home with most viewers and is sure to strike an emotional chord in audiences everywhere. One of those issues is the fact that a divorce is more about how to deal with the children than about getting on with life. The movie does not take away the focus from the childrens' feelings towards their situation. At one point, Anna stands up and shouts, ""You didn't ask me if I wanted a new mother!"" The story is still about the feud between Jackie and Isabel, but this feud centers around what each of them feels is best for the children, keeping with the fact that in a divorce, they are the ones who are most affected.
Actors Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, Anna and Ben, do a terrific job in bringing out all of that emotion and feeling in their characters. Aiken's character is not required to be as emotional as Malone's: he is only eight years old in the movie, and does not clearly understand what his parents are going through. He is merely along for the ride, going with what his parents say and what his sister wants, and Aiken brings all of that childhood innocence out perfectly and with believability. Malone must provide a much more involved role: her character is older, and lashes out against her father for leaving his mother and preparing to be with a woman half his age. Malone is full of tears, anger, and laughs, and her performance is heartwrenching and convincing.
Another issue is embedded in the relationship between Jackie and Isabel. Jackie has the maternal instinct where Isabel is trying her best, and the story is intensified emotionally by the clashes in how they feel the children should be raised. When Jackie realizes that Isabel is going to be a permanent part of her children's lives, she also comes to the realization that she cannot keep arguing with her about how to raise the children. As they come to an understanding of one another, it's intriguing to watch the two actresses interact onscreen.
Susan Sarandon is plays Jackie, who is stubborn and becomes quite disturbed when Isabel steps onto her turf. She brings out all this emotion and feeling, as well as her actions and reactions, convincingly, matching the performance of Roberts, her opposite. Roberts is Isabel, and she brings all the brightness and charm of her own person into the role while also maintaining a short emotional fuse. It is easy to see that the two actresses are having fun in their roles, and their pairing for this movie is outstanding. Their performances make this one of the best movies of the year. Ed Harris plays the part of Luke, who knows how Jackie feels but wishes that she and Isabel would be able to come to an understanding of one another. His performance is earnest and warming, and like his costars, he makes his role believable and interesting.
""Stepmom"" is one of those feel-good movies that was able to keep my interest throughout. There is a twist in the plot that I dare not even mention, because the filmmakers and producers have done a pretty good job of not giving it away in the promotional material. There is a lot of love between the characters, brought out by the stellar cast and a director whose films in this field have excelled. Based on emotional depth and connectivity, ""Stepmom"" is a nice piece of heart that is filled with true human feeling.",985996800,6,5325,4.739224137931035

10877,5,0767819462,"This was truly a heartfelt movie which had a few comical moments and a heart wrenching storyline.
  The story begins as the live-in girlfriend, Isabel(Julia Roberts) of Luke (Ed Harris) wakes up late and tries to get the kids ready for school.  Isabel spends a large part of this movie trying to find a way into the two children's lives and to have them accept her as part of theirs.  And of course this is never easy.  The role of Mom(Susan Sarandon) is built as a strong character who has endured her husband leaving her and is trying to raise her kids with shared custody.  She is often characterized as the one who can do no wrong.  The plot thickens as the children and the audience sees Luke wanting to marry Isabel and then their mother falling sick with cancer.
  This was a truly outstanding film both because of the actors themselves, but also because it brought the audience so close to the heart of the film.
  I would definately recommend that anyone see this movie, especially if you need a good cry or if you are a parent going through a divorce and/or remarriage.  It may encourage people to be a little nicer to each other and see what a difference it may make to the children who too often get stuck in the middle.",980035200,2,1232,4.402654867256637

The children in the movie shine throughout, and Ed Harris is, as usual, appealing, masculine, bringing gravity to his role as the man in the middle.  The Christmas settings, the snowfalls, the terminal illness, and the classic song ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" all combine to produce more than a few well-earned tears, none more so than in the final ten minutes. Chris Columbus, the director, allows delicate, and sometimes not so delicate, humor, to ease the real pain of many of these well-wraught scenes.

This is a movie about real-life situations that will cause a person to take pause for  thought, for sure. The performances by everyone were OUTSTANDING, even  provoking me to tears, & for me, that's a rare happening! I definitely,  highly recommend this one, & without me revealing the plot or other  juicy details, I'll just say it's worth watching, & I very much enjoyed  this one. I've watched it more than once, & know I'll be watching it  again probably several more times sometime in the future. Isn't one you'll  soon forget, as a lot of movies oftentimes are very forgettable.",960336000,,712,4.739837398373984
10893,5,0767819462,"This is yet another good film about a difficult subject: relationships. We all have them, or try to have them. Outside our own range of experience, we can only guess at some of the things that are going on. You may be thinking  about getting a divorce, you may be flirting with the idea of a separation,  but until you get in there and do it and live it, you really have no idea  what it's all about. Is it possible that films like ""Stepmom"" can help us  make wiser decisions? Wouldn't it be nice.
Both Susan Sarandon and Julia  Roberts give tremendous performances in this film about the end of the  beginning of something new. That it might turn out to include everyone  involved, for a while, leads to both a delightful discovery and a poignant  counterpoint to the original breakdown. This is a film in which everyone  concerned is asked to move forward, whatever their ages. It just may be  that we the audience, are also moved forward a tad, at the same time.  Excellent cinema.",957830400,,984,4.47191011235955
10894,5,0767819462,"This is a movie you must see. It is really sad but it still is really good. i can relate to the daughter really well because we are about the same age. i placed myself in her position. the movie is about how the kids  learn to accept their mother's death, their parent's divorce, and their new  mother. out of 5 stars, this is worth 6.",956102400,,335,4.0606060606060606
10895,3,0767819462,"My main reason for the low review was the story.  I found it hard to believe stepmom and X wife were interacting regularly to resolve issues regarding the kids.  I mean, you have a series of conflicts between the  two which finally lead to Julia's acceptance into the family?  Just didn't  add up.  I didn't find any of the events or all the events put together  fulfilling enough to justify the acceptance.  I don't know any stepmom that  would put up with half the stuff Julia's character did.  The DVD is fairly  decent.  The video transfer is good, the audio is nice and the extras are  ok.  But unless you're a big fan of Julia Robert's or Susan Sarandon's, I  don't see the point in watching this movie or purchasing it for that  matter.",955411200,,743,4.432835820895522
10896,3,0767819462,"I am sorry to say that I found this movie just a little too far from the reality.  Julia Roberts (stepmom)  insisted so much to pick up the kids and drop off the kids by herself, even risk loosing her job. But why?  Did she  try to do it all to prove to her new hubby that she can be a good mom or  she simply happens to love these brats?  I found it quite unbelievable that  she is so willing to accomodate all the hardships.  The movie didn't really  show that the relationship between her and her new hubby is too great to  break (there is not much emotions between the couple except a few kiss  scenes) so where is all her feelings attached to the kids coming from? To  me she is just trying too hard that she only proves she is a very insecure  woman regardless of her successful career.  Near the end of the movie Julia  finally confess to the biological mom that she is worried that one day Anna  will grow up only wondering where her real mom is in her wedding, I found  this scene incredibly unpersuasive.  How old is Julia Roberts supposed to  be in this film didn't she think that one day she will bear child of her  own?  It is true that there are many wonderful and responsible stepmoms out  there but this one just tries a little too hard.  Too hard to buy it.",955324800,3,1274,4.131147540983607

Although what happens in the movie is quite rare in real life (we all wish stepmom, mom and ex-hubby  would all get along) it still doesn't fail to deliver a great message of  love to each viewer. Julia Roberts is stunning and beautiful, Susan  Sarandon is remarkable.  I just wish Ed Harris would have gotten a bit more  action in the movie, because he is talented as well.
""Stepmom""  is very sad but also happy at the same time; it's definately worth seeing,  so don't miss it for the world.",953856000,2,617,4.304347826086956

Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts are so wonderful together in this film!  Both of  them earned my applause.  Jena Malone is great as the jilted daughter, as  is Ed Harris.  This is gonna jerk a lot of tears, but it is a magnificent  movie that should be shared by families all over the world.",952041600,2,419,4.363636363636363

It's a very touching movie that really makes you stop and think about life, and how wonderful it is!  Susan  Sarandon really seems like the charater she portrays (Jackie Harrison the  mother of 2 children).  She is diagnosed with cancer just as her ex-husband  gets engaged.  She fears that the children's new stepmom will take her  place after she passes away, yet the stepmom (Julia Roberts as Isabelle) is  afraid that she will never be able to make the kids accept her.  The two of  them become friends at the end.  The song ""Ain't no mountain high  enough"" really portrays the meaning and moral of the whole picture.  This fantastic movie will make you laugh and cry at the same time!  Take my  advice and see it!  I wish I could rate it higher than 5 stars because it  deserves at least 10!",951609600,5,909,4.466257668711656

10905,5,0767819462,"I have waited forever for a fabulous movie such as this where the stepmom is a caring parent who will go through just about anything to make things workout, yet still be witty and stick up for herself. Julia Roberts was at  her best. Susan Sarandon was perfect. Whenever you hear the word  ""stepmom"" most think ""wicked"" should be attached. I am  a stepmom and know how painful it can get. We're not all bad step mothers,  some of us are stepmoms. This movie was very accurate and showed both sides  of the fence. One reviewer said children are not aloud to act this way in  real life, HA. This was a very mild case of what true step families go  through. These childrens lives are being torn apart and they will stop at  nothing to stop their pain. But as the movie shows, it's not because they  are bad, and the stepmom isn't bad for falling in love with their dad, and  once you see through the pain there really can be peace in the end with  true love and understanding. We CAN have a great relationship with one  another . Wonderful show, well worth owning. It truly showed the struggle  real families go through in a fun, humorous and touching way. I took my  stepson to see it. It was our first date. We loved it. He laughed and cried  through the whole show.",950832000,17,1265,4.3008474576271185
10906,5,0767819462,"A great film. Why? Because Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts are performing in a very impressive way, giving us the whole meaning of the film from another point of view. What does the word ""Stepmom"" actually mean  to you? What do you feel when you hear that word? Is it always like this?  If you watch the film you will understand that it goes far further from its  actual meaning - it can also mean ""a second mother"" rather than a  bad old lady who will try to harm the kids. ""Stepmom"" sometimes  means a friend of the actual mother, a good wife, a person that is there  for you no matter what!  Watch the film if you like drama and social  films.",949622400,4,647,4.203252032520325
10907,1,0767819462,"This is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. Not that the plot is that boring or the music not entertaining. But it is indicative of Hollywood's limits - having Roberts, Sarandon and Harris (thank God he's in here)  together is by no means a guarantee for a good movie. Everything sounds  fake, the acting is really poor, especially Julia Roberts' - but this isn't  new (see the last scene, for example). Let's forget this movie, there are  thousands of others waiting to be seen.",947462400,2,483,4.5813953488372094

Ed Harris is always good of course and seems to inhabit  his character with all of his being. Of course he does this with all of his  roles, but it's just nice to know you can rely on him. Stepmom is about  real life and real people. Give those insipid Hollywood formula films a  rest and see the reason why film was invented, to explore human drama.",932688000,,516,4.288659793814433

10913,3,0767819462,"Well, the good news is that Sarandon and Roberts are such appealing and affecting actors that they are able to carry this fairly predictable film on their backs as long as they can.  Sarandon's character is so  relentlessly mean to Roberts through the first hour and a half that the  ultimate kissy-huggy life enhancing experience we are all supposed to have  towards the end defies belief (I mean, if Sarandon's character is such a  perfect mom, wouldn't she be at least a little kinder and a lot less  selfish/obsessively rude to Roberts, considering that her kids *will* be  spending time with Roberts and Harris).  Sarandon is such a -- well, you  know -- that whatever shortcomings Roberts' character has as a potential  mother, you forgive simply because she is so mistreated (Roberts also looks  strangely like Barbra Streisand several times; maybe it's the bangs).  And  compare the kids' ""bye mom, we love you"" scenes with the  comparable Debra Winger Terms of Endearment (incomparable, actually).  But  it's a big wallow and lots of autumn leaves and Ed Harris' blue eyes and  the two women -- be sure to watch this in widescreen/2.35 as I think it  will lose a lot in a pan and scan version.",925689600,,1202,4.780487804878049

Its the kind of person everyone needs  in theirs lifes to be similing all the time. To put a smiling face in bad  moments. To know how to front bad moments.
