8231009,5,B000VXWIFG,I enjoy the Eastman series of DVD's. I like their appreciation of the out doors and their encouragement for DIY hunts. I also like the fact that they don't have a bunch of head banger music playing and all the fake excitement after they get something. Eastman's are on a very short list of DVD's I will slow in the house. Thanks guys.,1395014400,,334,4.317460317460317
