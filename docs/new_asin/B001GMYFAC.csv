I am going to have to order the Rainforest DVD too!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scenic-Trex-Rainforest/dp/B001GMX9Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scenic Trex Rainforest</a>",1224201600,6,302,8.181818181818182

3616829,3,B001GMYFAC,"the beach walk starts out great then just stops and seems to stay on just the water and waves with no walking, bummed. the forrest part is great and you are on trails the entire length. would be great if the beach walk was like the forest",1461369600,,238,4.085106382978723
3616830,5,B001GMYFAC,So dreamy & lush. Reminds me of home. Thank you for a great product.,1453852800,,68,3.9285714285714284
3616831,3,B001GMYFAC,It's a slow pace walk.  Pleasant scenery,1445644800,,40,4.714285714285714
3616832,3,B001GMYFAC,luv it,1442361600,,6,2.5
3616833,2,B001GMYFAC,No. It says for cycling as well. That would only work if I were pushing the bike. Movement too slow for biking. This was a waste for me. Can I return?  Good for walking only,1435017600,2,173,3.942857142857143
3616834,3,B001GMYFAC,"This tape was okay.  I mean it's a trek thru the jungle and along the beach.  Lots of greenery, you won't see any jungle animals, the guy with the camera looks straight ahead and does not give you any idea of what's around him, totally tunnel vision.  I would almost say the tape is boring, but I guess when I saw Jungle, I kinda thought it would be at least a monkey or a peacock or something of a jungle in sight.  This was not too far removed from a walk in the woods.",1431907200,2,471,3.978723404255319
3616835,5,B001GMYFAC,Would absolutely purchase again! Highly recommended. We are very happy with our purchase. The product is high quality and the customer service was as well. AAA+++ Thank you... We will be back for more!,1430956800,,201,4.9411764705882355
3616836,4,B001GMYFAC,Walked fast paced with Jungle route and used beach scenes for cool down which are very refreshing.,1429574400,2,98,4.823529411764706
3616837,4,B001GMYFAC,diverse scenery was great but could have used it faster while on the Tony Little glider,1428451200,,87,4.5
3616838,2,B001GMYFAC,"It was very nice as advertised..... however, I guess if I was shooting a scenic trek I would pan the camera around just like you would look around as you are taking a scenic hike.  This literally stayed focused on the trail the entire time!  It took away from the ""feeling of being there"".",1426636800,2,289,4.333333333333333
3616839,5,B001GMYFAC,Beautiful scenes that are enjoyable to watch while exercising at home.,1426377600,,70,5.454545454545454
3616840,5,B001GMYFAC,Excellent DVD that takes treadmill walking to a higher level of enjoyment. Following the anticipation of the trail makes my treadmill walking time go so quickly. Love this DVD.,1422921600,,176,5.103448275862069
3616841,1,B001GMYFAC,"Didn't work for me.  Two of the videos are stationary, you watch the clouds move.  The other are less than walking pace.  Reduced my workout experience.",1422403200,,152,4.769230769230769
3616842,5,B001GMYFAC,Recorded TV is boring...but the walking scenes are like walking outdoors and I love them.  Its like being outdoors. I have two dvds by scenic trex and will probably buy more. There is no jerkyness to the walk...its like you are actually taking the walk.  I love the sounds.  On cold dreary winter days...on days when I don't have time to make it outdoors...this is fantastic. I recommend this series by Scenic Trex,1419724800,2,414,4.6438356164383565

3616846,3,B001GMYFAC,"I initially had to adjust to the 'floating feeling' I had since the camera didn't look down or around as a person walking would.  I did experience a feeling of 'what's ahead' and wanting to continue to watch.  It was a surprise when the video transitioned from one pathway to another (faded from one dead-end path to another).  I also thought there was more than one walk on it (my failure to read the item descriptor correctly).  The walk was actually down several paths, many which simply dead-ended.
Overall, this was more interesting than watching a blimp go around a circle flat track!",1416787200,,590,4.699029126213592
3616847,5,B001GMYFAC,This virtual walking  DVD's make the task of taking time out to exercise a whole lot easier.  The inventer knew they had to work!,1413763200,,129,4.333333333333333

3616850,4,B001GMYFAC,"I don't own this product but was house-sitting for a friend who had it.  I used it with her treadmill and got hooked!  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is I wish there was an android app available because I don't own a treadmill, have to go to the gym and there are no DVD players there.  But I could watch it on my tablet if there was an app.  Maybe soon?",1406937600,,363,3.8
3616851,5,B001GMYFAC,"Walking on a tread mill is an essential but dreaded part of my life and my definition of boredom. So I have found  this virtual walking DVD very helpful. I have always loved walking outdoors and tricking my mind into this virtual outdoor treck makes a world of difference. I can take an pollen free indoor walk, night or day, even at age seventy-five.",1396656000,2,351,4.484375
3616852,2,B001GMYFAC,Not what I expected and very boring. Poorly filmed and only good for a very slow walk.  Not very good for the treadmill workout.,1394150400,,128,4.333333333333333

3616854,4,B001GMYFAC,"Yes I said run. You can watch this in fast forward mode for different paces if you wish. I really like the near feeling of trail running and a nice run along the beach and sunset at the end. Only wish they didn't cut out parts, but even so they faded in and out very well with the edits they made.",1390953600,3,297,3.8852459016393444
3616855,5,B001GMYFAC,Well if you are stuck at home because of rain or have nasty cold weather than this is a great video for you. I truly enjoyed the experience this secenry had to offer for my treadmill experience. I really am able to imagine myself in the surroundings of this beachside jungle trail. I just turn on my favorite music and away I go. I only wish the trail was longer. The start of the video allows you to stretch to the sunrise which is pretty cool and then it goes out onto the trail. I mostly jog rather than walk so jogging to this video was challenging as it has low tree limbs and raised roots that had me actually ducking and jumping at times on my treadmill as if I were really there. I guess it is just an automatic response so it was actually a better workout because of the obstacles. I liked it and I ordered another another video to change it up.,1387238400,2,854,4.150602409638554
3616856,4,B001GMYFAC,work great for the treadmill & reminds me of walking through some of the terrific parks that lead to the Gulf in Florida .,1385251200,,122,4.125
3616857,4,B001GMYFAC,"It was a great video and made time on the treadmill go faster, I also liked having the warm-up and cool-down times.  However, it was a bit slow for my running.  Would be nice to see a video at a faster pace.",1383436800,,207,3.9047619047619047
3616858,2,B001GMYFAC,"All of the Scenic Trex video are murky, low qualityand not at all comparable
to the one I have gotten from Virtual Walks. Be assured that I will not buy any others!!!",1377043200,,166,4.21875
3616859,4,B001GMYFAC,"Very serene, easy to follow, my first scenic venture.  Will purchase more variety.  I liked going down different paths and beaches.  Quite pretty.",1374537600,2,146,5.260869565217392
3616860,3,B001GMYFAC,"I bought this in an attempt to bring the virtual reality experience to my use if my elliptical trainer. I set up my TV infront of it on the cheap - 16 inch screen. I have Sennheiser wireless headphones but I haven't found the sound output to me TV. But that's OK since I DO have 315 hours of MP3 music available to my headphones. For these tapes to be more Virtual I need a 110"" screen and theater speakers!!! So the tapes are - OK.",1374278400,,432,4.034883720930233
3616861,4,B001GMYFAC,"Not quite what I expected but then I wasn't sure what to expect!! I haven't used it as much as I thought I would but don't really have the set up to make the best use of it. It was worth what I paid for it, though, and I may lend it out to my daughter who would probably use it more.",1368576000,,283,3.5806451612903225
3616862,2,B001GMYFAC,Kind of boring just walking thru the jungle.  I will order the next one where you can actually see the sights of a city!!!,1364256000,,122,4.083333333333333
3616863,5,B001GMYFAC,This makes walking and jogging at home so peaceful and serene.  I can go through the whole DVD before I realize it!  The scenery is just beautiful.,1363478400,2,147,4.407407407407407
3616864,5,B001GMYFAC,The video production is good.  It is exactly as advertised as a trip jogging down jungle trails and makes you feel like you are there.,1361145600,2,134,4.36
3616865,5,B001GMYFAC,"I thought the scenery in this dvd was gorgeous.  I wish I lived there so I could go for that walk for real everyday.  It starts you off with the warm-up section that has you looking out over the ocean and the sky.  You then start a stroll along this tree lined path where you can still hear the ocean tide like it was just on the other side of the trees and the birds singing.  After about 25 minutes of that you end up walking along the beach with the tide going in and out around your feet and finally you end up watching a beautiful sunset while you cool-down.

The reveiwer that said there is no sound must have had theirs turned off/down or received a faulty recording, because I was able to hear the birds and the waves with no problem.  I turned the volume up on high so that it sounded more like I was right there.  Also, the reveiwers who thought it was boring and slow must have been looking for something that seemed more like you were jogging or bicycling fast.  This is like a stroll.  I am sure there are other dvd's made more for that faster paced scenery. If you are not looking for something more fast paced, I think you will really enjoy this.  It is gorgeous and relaxing.

This would be a great dvd for those with high blood pressure who need a way to relax.  Just put it on and sit back in your chair and watch/listen to it and you can't help but feel relaxed.",1360627200,2,1381,4.131086142322097
3616866,2,B001GMYFAC,"I was rather disappointed because it looks like you are out for a stroll.  I walk rather fast and the scenic view is just too slow. I was hoping you could adjust the speed, but unfortunately that can't be done.",1360281600,,210,4.25
3616867,5,B001GMYFAC,Im not doing this right. see my remarks from the first DVD. I love all 3 of the DVD's I purchased.,1359849600,,98,3.7142857142857144
3616868,1,B001GMYFAC,Very dissappointed in this video.  Very boring.  A waste of money.  More interesting to watch VTN while exercising.  Joyce Meyer gets me revved up.,1359590400,,147,5.0
3616869,5,B001GMYFAC,"Bought for my husband when he works out he enjoys this tape.
It arrived on time and in great shape.
Thanks, Irma",1359158400,,112,4.136363636363637
3616870,2,B001GMYFAC,i was very disapointed in all three to me there was no motivation to walk  i was bored with the beach one it was the same thing over and over again  sorry i bought 3 of them,1358553600,,173,3.6486486486486487
3616871,2,B001GMYFAC,"It needs some sound effects or some soft music ect.  to listen to.........A bit boreing with no sound. Maybe some jungle sounds ,such as birds Ect.",1357862400,,147,4.653846153846154
3616872,5,B001GMYFAC,This DVD is great.  I was running on my treadmill during a snowstorm and completely got lost in my trek through the Jungle!  I would recommend this for anyone looking for an escape from dull treadmill runs.,1357603200,,206,4.54054054054054
3616873,2,B001GMYFAC,"I would have put animations in the scenes after using for three days became un interested in using it.
believe if there were people in backgroungs would be more pleasing to watch.",1353110400,,179,4.625
3616874,5,B001GMYFAC,"I purchased this Video along with the Eastern US runs for variety for our daily treadmill workouts, makes exercising much more enjoyable.  Both videos arrived in a couple of days in great condition. Amazon makes shopping so easy, Thanks again, I just love my Amazon Prime membership, well worth the money!",1341360000,,305,4.980392156862745
3616875,5,B001GMYFAC,I Really enjoy walking much more while walking through the beachside jungle.  It Seems so real with all of the sounds and scenery.  I love it!,1336953600,3,142,4.423076923076923
3616876,4,B001GMYFAC,"I use this while on my treadmill but I only have a DVD player, it would be better to have a larger screen to view it.",1336867200,2,117,3.5384615384615383
3616877,3,B001GMYFAC,"Overall this walking dvd isn't bad. The beach scenery is great, but I found the jungle path a bit long and monotonous and craving to get out on the beach and some wide open spaces.  Would love it if they didn't cut out on the crossing of bridges or streams. You finally see something different and then they disappear and you find yourself a little bit further along the path.  I really did enjoy the beach though, although this is a much shorter time than the jungle path.",1333756800,,473,4.363636363636363
3616878,1,B001GMYFAC,Both Beachside and Rainforest are far from what these should be. They lack professionalism. Workout videos should enhance with vibrancy - not with drab trail scenes whereby the movement along the path is shifted somewhere else on a whim. I didn't realize a video could be shot with a Brownie Kodak camera! I have never seen a camera's focus shift in and out as much as this. One can hear the gizmo used to carry this camera as it creaks and squeaks along. What a sham! Never again!,1329436800,4,481,4.4772727272727275
3616879,3,B001GMYFAC,"Parts of the jungle path felt closed in by bush and trees. Nice steady walking pace.  A peaceful interlude in the forest.  It will take some getting used to some of the turns in such crowded conditions, but I could definitely enjoy the solitude of the jungle forest.  The cooldown part of the video would benefit from panning the horizon a bit, instead of just pointing at the same spot, but a beautiful view anyway.",1326585600,,416,4.52
3616880,3,B001GMYFAC,"I purchased this and a few other videos to use while exercising on our treadmill. They work quite well and help keep you from getting bored to death looking at your feet or staring at the wall. This particular video has you walking through dense jungle on a trail. Kind of neat.... but also kind of claustrophobic. More open scenery might be nice.... and I later bought some desert hiking videos that provide this a little better. Having said that, it is still nice to get the feeling of walking through a dense rainforest that comes out on a nice beach. Makes a 30 minute workout whiz right by.",1320278400,28,595,4.467889908256881
3616881,5,B001GMYFAC,"I've never heard of these nature walking DVD's before and just happened to find them while browsing other fitness walking DVD's.  I thought I'd give this a try because I've always been a big fan of music with nature sounds in it and I thought this would work for me.  It really does.  There is no music in it, but you hear all kinds of nature sounds, which is such a nice thing to hear after all the noise we're bombarded with every day.

As far as the workout goes, this is definitely not a fast paced workout if that's what you are looking for.  But, you go along at a nice steady pace.  I'm using mine on my indoor trampoline and I do pretty much a slow jog through the whole DVD, which seems to keep right up with the pace of the video.  I found it really motivating to actually feel like I'm going somewhere, and will go the whole distance and length of the DVD (approx.  45 minutes) which is much longer than I've ever gone while watching the news or something else I get bored with.

The Trek you go on in this DVD starts on a path - just like a walking path you'd see in your neighborhood - in the jungle and you walk for about 35 minutes until you get to a big gate that leads to the beach.  While you are in the jungle, you walk around curves, up and down hills, through a little bit of rain, along cliffs, under trees, etc.  The beach walk is shorter and is kind of a cool down from the walk.  You just walk along the beach, going past some chairs and cabanas and through a couple rocky areas.  The scenery always changes - just like a real walk.  At the end of my workout, I feel good about having walked so long, but I also feel kind of relaxed because of the nature scenes and sounds.  I highly recommend this.",1319932800,17,1724,4.089285714285714
3616882,2,B001GMYFAC,I was very disappointed with this DVD--I definitely wasted my money on this one.  There wasn't anything to keep your pace going.  The DVD almost put you to sleep--BORING!,1310860800,,170,4.827586206896552
3616883,4,B001GMYFAC,"I exercise at work during lunch and, unfortunately, it's just a converted office space (but better than nothing!).  Needless the say, with only 4 walls, some exercise equipment, and a locker to look at -- my workout can get rather boring quite quickly.  This excellent quality DVD is just the ticket to help with the boredom factor.  I was concerned about potential 'walking motion' during the taping, but was happy to see it is steady throughout and the pace was perfect -- not too fast, and not too slow. I am glad they did not try to 'simulate' the speed of someone actually 'exercising', instead, the pace is a steady walk, perfect for viewing the scenery and giving you something to watch. I add my music with ear-buds for additional 'entertainment' and that helps the time go a bit faster.",1304035200,9,795,4.664285714285715
3616884,2,B001GMYFAC,"I read several pleasing reviews before purchasing, so I was expecting no letdowns. I was horrified at the video quality and speed of movement. This definitely is not something you can bike or run to. The speed is more like that of a leisurely walk, which I wouldn't have minded so much just for a chance to see the sun here in MI, except that the video quality was poor and the scene kept cutting to a new location midstream. I find it hard to believe they couldn't come up with a long enough stretch of beach for one walk. It would have been better if they had saved money by not going to someplace exotic like St. Lucia & used the money to improve the quality of the video. Unfortunately, there is nothing out there that is comparable in theory to the Trex videos. I think I'll just borrow a video camera and take a walk or run along Lake MI and replay it when I want outdoor scenery. I don't think it would look any worse. Better luck next time Trex.",1297900800,6,953,4.213114754098361
3616885,5,B001GMYFAC,"I purchased this DVD and also the Fitness Journeys Tropical Scenery...this one is definitely my favorite of the two DVD's.  It has a lot more beach time, which is what I was looking for.  Makes the time on the treadmill go much faster!",1297296000,4,235,4.441860465116279
3616886,2,B001GMYFAC,"This DVD is monotonous and boring.  The jungle trek is especially uninteresting and if you are even the slightest bit claustrophobic it will make you very uncomfortable.  The beach scenes quickly become boring, as well.  This DVD might be okay for cycling and treadmill work but definitely not worthwhile for walkers.  Forget buying this one.  In my opinion, it is total waste of money.",1294963200,5,386,4.96875
3616887,5,B001GMYFAC,"I found this dvd to be an enjoyable indoor walking experience. The illusion of forward motion is motivating. The scenery is beautiful and immersive. It's long enough to be a good workout on a treadmill, elliptical, nordic track type thing, or anything else that simulates walking. I found it to be too slow for cycling, but perfect for walking or maybe slow jogging. The warm up and cool down scetions, as described in other reviews, make for a nice addition to this great dvd.",1294790400,4,477,4.690476190476191
3616888,5,B001GMYFAC,"This is the DVD I have been looking for! I love to hike, but cannot always get to a hiking trail. I love the woods, the beach, the ocean and with this DVD I get it all. It starts with a 5 minute inspirational warm-up overlooking the ocean. I can do warm-up stretches and exercises or sip my morning coffee while enjoying the ocean view...my choice. No one talks to me or interrupts my reverie. There are no people in the DVD. The first segment takes me on a 37 minute hike through the jungle with natural jungle sounds. There is NO MUSIC in this DVD, it is all natural sounds. The sounds are real, not the fake imitation sounds you get with some products. The hike takes me across the island and to the ocean where the 12 minute beach-side hike begins. This segment follows the edge of the ocean where I see & hear the waves crashing in. I can almost feel the water lapping at my ankles and the sand between my toes! The view is as though I am walking, looking straight ahead. It does not seem to matter what speed I set my treadmill on,the video seems to match my stride. I don't find myself feeling as though the view is dragging behind nor do I feel I have to rush to keep up. The cool-down segment has me feeling that I am sitting on the beach watching the sun set on the horizon. As with the morning warm-up, I can stretch and exercise or I can sip a drink and enjoy the sunset. This video is everything I had hoped it would be. I definitely will purchase other Scenic Trex products.",1293494400,8,1488,4.188153310104529
3616889,3,B001GMYFAC,"I like this video but some parts of the trail are a little tight.  It seems like the camera-person was not sure of the path sometimes which would cause me to slow down and hesitate when walking.  That's not a good thing to do on a treadmill that's set at a particular speed.  If you just watch the video like a movie, it's fine.  But I actually got into it, so it was a less satisfying experience.",1289433600,2,397,4.116883116883117
3616890,4,B001GMYFAC,I have tried doing my bike on a trainer to watching tv or reading but am unable to stay on the bike because I get bored or too interested in the program...but with this video I am able to go without problem becaseu it keeps my intrest but unlike a TV show I don't stop when it gets good!,1280793600,,287,3.8813559322033897
3616891,3,B001GMYFAC,"This DVD would not play on my new Mac Book Pro computer.  It doesn't even show as a disc on my desktop, instead it shows as a folder.  Bummer.  When viewing on my TV... Jungle trails look the same for the entire 37 mins.  Where are the vistas, and different terrain?  Beach shots are nice though.  Also the warmup and cool down is only 1 long video shot.  Now instruction or anything.  There are better bike/treadmill videos out there.",1280016000,,435,4.417721518987341
3616892,5,B001GMYFAC,"I have been using another set of virtual DVDs that are meant for cycling, but I use them on my treadmill. I've been so happy with them that when I got this one, I really was prepared to be disappointed.

I was delighted with it!

I hit the 'Play All' rather than choosing a specific segment. So we started out with a gorgeous still setting, with the sound of the ocean, which invigorated me as I got myself settled in on my treadmill. I was puzzled for a moment and thought that's all there was to it, so I stopped it and checked. Sure enough, that was just the warm-up.

Next, we come out of a little wooden gate onto a jungle path, surrounded with palm trees and other greenery. The sound was pleasant and non-intrusive. In fact, the sound of my treadmill was the only thing that annoyed me and I usually don't like the cheesy kind of sound on most 'scenery' videos.

So we travel on down that path, always choosing to go left when the path goes 2 directions. There are times when we go over small bridges and catch a glimpse of the water below.

Eventually I wondered if we would EVER get to the ocean, but we did. What a gorgeous view. I felt as if I were walking barefoot in the sand, with the waves coming in over my feet, sometimes having to walk around pieces of wood, etc., that had floated in from the sea. I felt as if I were really there.

I'm very pleased with this. It has a place by my bike-o-vision DVDs. I like to go to a different location to 'walk' or cycle or travel on my elliptical machine <grin> every day. It is such an incentive to get in there and spend that time which may also keep me healthy.

I recommend this DVD IF you are a person who loves nature.",1267056000,43,1681,4.153846153846154

The beach run is short and then it just stops while looking out at the ocean for several minutes. The jungle run was a little better but at one point, you are coming down a decline toward a pool of water and before you get to it, the scene changes. I would not recommend this for the $15 I paid.",1254441600,6,405,4.075
3616894,5,B001GMYFAC,"I enjoyed the other DVD from this line, and this one fabulous, too!  DVD features a nicely paced trek through the jungle -- not only the perfect start to my workout, but motivates me to keep moving.  Hoping for more DVDs in the future...!",1231891200,4,238,4.386363636363637
3616895,5,B001GMYFAC,"I own several walking DVD's of this type, but this is one of the best.  The scenery is lush and the photography is steady and smooth and moves along just like you're walking in a beachside jungle or on a beautiful beach in St. Lucia.  In the background you hear the waves on the shore and the birds and other natural sounds.  It's easy to imagine yourself in a completely different, exotic place rather than at home on your treadmill or elliptical trainer.

One thing I especially liked about this DVD is that there is a 5 minute warm up section where you're on this beautiful jungle clearing overlooking the ocean with large rock outcroppings in the distance and the sun rising.  It almost looks like a still scene except for the clouds slowly moving and a bird flying by every now and then.  It's a good time to do a few stretches before beginning your walk.

The next part is the beachside jungle which is 37 minutes long.  There you'll walk on a path among the palms and lush tropical plants.  The birds and sound of the distant ocean are the only sounds you'll hear (unless you want to turn down the sound and use your mp3 player instead) as you walk along, looking at the scenery.  The next part is the beach with it's high rocks along the shore and palapas overlooking the ocean.  This part is 12 minutes long.  You'll be walking at the ocean's edge with water lapping at your feet.  This is a beautiful way to wake up in the morning!

The last part is a sunset and cool down which is 20 minutes long.  As you watch the sun setting you might enjoy a few yoga poses or maybe a more leisurely walk after your workout.

I think these ""virtual treadmill"" or ""virtual walk"" DVD's are a wonderful way to make walking indoors as interesting as walking outside.  For me, it makes the time go quickly and puts me in a great frame of mine to begin my day.",1231804800,78,1852,4.321739130434783
3616896,5,B001GMYFAC,This is such a breath of fresh air!  I am in the Midwest and I miss the ocean and tropical scenery so much.  This DVD brightens my day and I actually really look toward to time on my elliptical again.  Thanks so much!,1226534400,6,217,4.0
3616897,5,B001GMYFAC,I love this new DVD put out by Scenic Trex! I spend a lot of time on the treadmill due to the quick workout i get and a busy schedule. Walking and running while taking in the scenery is so cool and so beautiful. This is the perfect combination for those of us who live in cold climate areas and who rely on the treadmill or other forms of exercise at home! A great gift also!!,1224547200,8,376,3.960526315789474

8306183,5,B001GMYFAC,"My favorite Caribbean location walking DVD.  I like to get on my elliptical, slather on the cocoa butter balm, put in the Calypso island music and go on my trek, stepping over coconuts, taking the trails along the stream, and ending up on the beach with the palm trees, sand, and the Pitons out in the sea.  The waves ripple up, you almost think your feet will get wet. Absolutely love it. I don't have any complaints about focus, resolution, shakiness, or glare.  You must realize you are under a jungle canopy in very bright sunlight which reflects off some shiny foliage intermittently where the sun manages to peek through. This is filmed at a famous resort in St. Lucia that I have subsequently seen on The Bachelor once.",1490659200,,726,4.612403100775194

8306187,2,B001GMYFAC,"Dislikes:
*Mostly only see low level shrubbery and the pathway until the beach scene. I wanted to yell, ""Look up. Look around. Please!"" But, that is futile. Camera stays directly on the trail and down. BORING!!!

*Could only hear  animals, not one sighted! Not sure if there was a lightly colored butterfly that floated by at one point, or if I just hoped so hard that I imagined it.

* Sunset scene was too long. Maybe they could have accelerated it while keeping the sound of the waves. That would be fantastic!

*Pace could be faster.

Likes:
*At least I could hear animals even if I couldn't see any.

*First several minutes is fine.

*Walk on the beach was best!!!! Could see more of the landscape including the sky with the mountain top in it.

*Could hear the waves at the beach, and the water is so blue and beautiful!

*Price. I guess ""you get what you pay for"" adage here. But honestly, a few bucks more and one of the other videos I've seen isn't much better.",1474156800,,970,4.404494382022472
