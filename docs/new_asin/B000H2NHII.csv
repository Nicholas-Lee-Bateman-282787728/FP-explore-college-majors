8136065,5,B000H2NHII,It's Bob Hope!  He's wonderful and his talent will never be seen again.  His comedy is funny and clean.  Today's comedians should watch and learn.,1436313600,,146,4.76
8136066,5,B000H2NHII,This is classic vintage bloopers. Bob Hope & Jack Benny are absolutely hilarious together and no doubt bloopers ensue. Numerous celebrities doing sketch's with Bob Hope will no doubt bring bloopers. The last blooper on the DVD was my favorite and had me laughing on the floor. A must see and enjoy!,1181260800,,298,4.75
8136067,1,B000H2NHII,"You will notice that Amazon does not tell you the length of this DVD. That's because it's so short probably no one would buy it. Also, they do not tell you this is a home-made DVD that is made for Region 2 so unless you have a all-regions DVD player you will have to buy one to play this program. It's sad to say that it appears Amazon is getting more and more deceptive in their descriptions or else they need help getting employees who will describe DVD's accurately. I can't believe so many DVD's they sell are actually different from what is advertised. How can one company have so many errors for so long a period unless it is part of a larger plan. To get a refund is more costly and trouble than it's worth and I've never received a refund for the many DVD's I've returned unopened that I know of. If you can, buy elsewhere.",1178064000,4,831,4.232704402515723
8136068,5,B000H2NHII,"Have you ever thought about what makes great comedy? Well, in my opinion, great comedy is made when no one expects it to happen, it surprises and shocks you. If you're like me and agree that truly great comedy is sometimes made by accident, then this DVD is right for you. Bob Hopes compilation of celebrity bloopers is comedy at its best, the behind the scenes footage is sure to please. If you have an appreciation for classic TV you won't be disappointed.",1164585600,,458,4.530120481927711
