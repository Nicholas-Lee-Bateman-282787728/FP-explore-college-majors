8171729,4,B000MTEFUA,"Whets my appetite for finally seeing a game at Wrigley, which I toured last year. Love the city, fondly remember eating at his main restaurant in the River North District.

Worth seeing for fans of the game, let alone the subject or teams mentioned-Cardinals, A's, White Sox, Cubs.",1440115200,,281,4.854166666666667

8171731,2,B000MTEFUA,"I grew up watching Harry first broadcast the White Sox games and even would watch him broadcast for that minor league baseball team, the Cubs. I wanted to get a DVD of Harry, so I bought this one.  I like the DVD, but don't love it.  I was hoping to see more clips of Harry calling games and less of the interviews of people that knew Harry, which makes up half the DVD. I would have been happy with a DVD of an actual game Harry called, but I will settle for what I have!",1203638400,,472,3.957894736842105
8171732,4,B000MTEFUA,"Harry was a genuine Sports Fan! He had that personality! He was an avid CARDS/WHITE SOX & CUBS Fan(altho the Cubz think Harry belongs to THEM).

This was a PBS Special but I bought it because we LOVE Reverse the Curse w/ the Red Sox! I HOPE HBO releases Wait Till Next Year as it's the same people who did Reverse. THAT will show how the Northsiders have stayed the same! My Dad & Uncle were diehard Cub fans. They brainwashed me until I gave up on them in '69. The more things change....ANYWAY: this is a great Docu about Harry, Dutchie, with comments from Steve Stoney & others who made a difference. Worth it!",1178496000,3,612,4.321739130434783
8171733,5,B000MTEFUA,"I saw this at the Beverly Hills Film festival recently. The audience had people of all ages and about half weren't baseball fans but still loved it. He was a larger than life character who is a national icon. The movie was educational, historical, entertaining, humorous and emotional with interviews from family, friends, sports personalities, broadcasters, fans and co-workers. The character was brought to life with rare footage and photographs plus intertwined with Major League Baseball and WGN Televison footage.  Bob Costas the historian who told of his early days and style of broadcasting in St. Louis; educational in that he was with 4 teams in his 53 years not just the Chicago Cubs;Mikde Ditka and Ryne Sandberg speak of his his enthusiam and entertaining with his mis pronunciations; steve Stone-humorous in the fact that he did things on purpose to entertain; and lastly emotional with parts from his televised funeral (celebration of life)annecdotes.

This is a must see movie that brings back this larger than life character.  Harry was not only the fans voice in the media but he was the ultimate fan! HOLY COW !!!

PS  The movie starts with an animated purple cow broadcasting.",1172620800,12,1195,5.0456852791878175
