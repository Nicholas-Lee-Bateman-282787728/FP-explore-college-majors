5088867,5,B007I6NHUY,Very interesting story about the construction of the Hoover Dam. Lots of original film shot during construction. The film depicts what a massive project the dam was.,1399766400,2,165,5.148148148148148
5088868,3,B007I6NHUY,Kind of a happy faced version of the project.  It glosses over many of the hardships endured by the work force and people who lived there.  It also treats the river as if was an evil monster that required taming in the name of progress.,1387843200,2,236,4.222222222222222
5088869,4,B007I6NHUY,Enjoyed this historical piece.  Very informative.  Didn't realize there were so many lives lost in the construction of the dam.  Rated as 4 because the narrator some in a low voice that was slightly difficult to understand at times.,1382400000,,232,4.897435897435898
5088870,5,B007I6NHUY,Facinating story of how Hoover dam was built. The actual pictures and video from that time is priceless. Thoroughly enjoyed it.,1445644800,,127,5.095238095238095
5088871,5,B007I6NHUY,"This documentary is one of the best I've seen on the Hoover Dam. When you watch it, you will be astounded at the technical problems they had to overcome in order to complete the project, and the ingenuity they used to do it. Absolutely amazing.",1444867200,,244,4.444444444444445

5088876,5,B007I6NHUY,Best I've seen the Hoover Dam project,1426636800,,37,4.428571428571429
5088877,3,B007I6NHUY,"A decent overview for the curious and answered a lot of my questions about construction. Seemed kind of like the PR version in places -- I would have been interested to know more about the deaths and the reality of the safety and working conditions. But for only 45 minutes long, it was pretty good.",1426118400,,299,4.454545454545454
5088878,4,B007I6NHUY,"I recently visited the Hoover Dam which was more exciting than I imagined. It was an incredible feat to build this dam. I am interested in history so I was looking forward to watching the dvd. The black and white film is of original footage shot during the building process. I thought it was interesting, however, not everyone does. Within 10 minutes I heard snoring and looked to see both my husband and daughter sound asleep.
To each his own, I guess.",1425686400,,453,4.536585365853658
5088879,5,B007I6NHUY,I've always been a fan of history and this documentary solidly covers the history of both the dam and the impact it has had on the surrounding environment.,1399766400,2,155,4.571428571428571
8517399,5,B007I6NHUY,great documentary movie,1490572800,,23,7.0
8517400,5,B007I6NHUY,"This is a great presentation of ""some"" of the sacrifices that were made for this great accomplishment.  It was a great undertaking at a time when we needed jobs and industry and more conservation of water.  The video was very well received.",1484524800,,240,4.690476190476191
8517401,5,B007I6NHUY,"Probably the most accurate documentary regarding the actual construction practices I have had the chance to view--very well done from the aggregates, concrete, and fabrication of the constituents of this historic dam project that would probably never be constructed today due to red tape and budget--",1482883200,,300,5.543478260869565
8517402,1,B007I6NHUY,"Yikes.  So boring.  Monotone voice, poor explainations, very detailed when it should have been told in layman's terms.  My friend and I were so looking forward to a good history lesson, and this didn't cut it.",1474934400,,209,4.75
8517403,3,B007I6NHUY,Well done but a bit slow.,1466553600,,25,3.3333333333333335
8517404,4,B007I6NHUY,"When I lived in Las Vegas and visited the dam, I didn't know how complex the construction was. This is an amazing video.",1465603200,,120,4.260869565217392
8517405,5,B007I6NHUY,Yes very insightful and good footage.,1461024000,,37,5.333333333333333

8517407,5,B007I6NHUY,Very informative!,1455926400,,17,8.0
8517408,5,B007I6NHUY,"It's got a narrator like one who would be in a filmstrip in old school and background music like an infomercial, but it's all good since it helps to build nostalgia as you watch the historical footage of the building of the Hoover Dam. I watched this once before going to Vegas and once again just because I saw it on my list and I was in the mood. It is so amazing how a project like this can be done. I would have never dreamed how they built the dam, where'd they put the water from the river while they worked, or what all is involved, and I can't even tell you how many times the narrator said that something was 'specially engineered and built for this project'!! The historical footage shows you the conditions people worked in that is so far off from OSHA requirements today. People were slapping rickety ladders against huge pipes and shimmying down cables with no safety lines, like old time high rise workers, and without the apparent need for them. Truly a marvel. Not boring at all.",1452902400,,995,4.413043478260869
