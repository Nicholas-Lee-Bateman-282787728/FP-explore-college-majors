If I knew nothing about Chile, this video would turn me away from this wonderful country. It is an absolutely horrid presentation with unfocused lenses and no rhyme nor reason as to its purpose. You would learn absolutely nothing from this presentation. To show the wonders of the Chilean fjords, the video concentrates on the steering wheel, bridge of the ship and bow light. It spends much time at the beginning showing copper mining and processing in the Atacama but that whole section comes across as just piles of dirt everywhere! Santiago is fleetingly covered in less than a couple of minutes and then it jumps to containers being loaded in Valparaiso. Nothing of the wonders of Chile are presented here.

I purchased this and the Panama DVD (which is even worse than this one) after buying the Argentina DVD several months ago. Although the Argentina video left of huge parts of Argentina (The Andes, Salta, Iguassu, most of Patagonia) it did a pretty decent job of presenting Buenos Aires and the southern tip of Argentina.

But this.... If you have any interest in Chile, don't waste your time on this.",1257897600,,1172,4.735294117647059
8143755,2,B000I2JDDA,I bought this to watch in my Spanish class and ended up sending it back. The  audio track is not of great quality and the voice is hard to understand. There also seems to be very little rhyme or reason to how the information is presented. I found the Globe Trekker movie to be a much better way of teaching my students about Chile and its culture.,1217203200,,347,4.17910447761194
