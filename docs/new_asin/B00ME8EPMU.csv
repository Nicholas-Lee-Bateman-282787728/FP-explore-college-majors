6568103,5,B00ME8EPMU,"This is a stunner of a film. It documents one man's steady service to the ""ancestral imperative,"" the duty imposed by talent to move the ball of justice down the court, if only an inch. Thurgood Marshall won 10 Supreme Court decisions, culminating in 1954's Brown vs. Board of Education, which found ""separate but equal"" public education to be unconstitutional.

But first came gruelling years.of travelling from small town to small town, sometimes smuggled in in a coffin, coaxing teachers to accept NAACP representation. His relaxed bonhomie and courtroom successes built up a steady core of empowered citizens, ready and waiting for the advent of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.

The University of Maryland Law School, which refused him admission, now bears his name.

Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor explains here that it is important to remember ""How much he loved the Consitution, how much he loved the law. He believed we could fulfill the promise.""

There is a story, not recorded here, that I want to be true. President Lyndon B. Johnson invited him to visit the White House late one evening, and asked him to use the servants' entrance. Once settled, Johnson said, ""You're probably wondering why I asked you to do that. There's a flock of reporters out there, watching who comes and goes. I wanted to tell you I am appointing you to the Supreme Court.""

Imagine the gaze they exchanged: the poor Texas hill country boy and the Baltimore kid who grew up under apartheid.

Imagine the road they had travelled.",1422748800,5,1524,4.910505836575876

8671729,5,B00ME8EPMU,"Thurgood Marshall argued, and won more US Supreme Court cases than anyone in history.

He traveled 30,000 miles a year, on the back roads of the Deep South fighting for desegregation and against Jim Crow law.

He had become famous for defending cases with black defendants, as  an NAACP lawyer, and as head of legal defense for the agency.

Every city and town he entered he would promote membership as a means to unite in the civil rights cause.

Because of his fame, every day of his life, he was in danger, and came as close to being lynched without it occuring, before he was saved by fellow ""Freedom Riders.""

He served on the Supreme Court until retirement after 23 years.

He has had more impact on how we live in the US than any other person, including Presidents.

Remarkable story told in this fascinating documentary. It should be required viewing yearly from grade 6-12.",1526601600,,882,4.645161290322581

8671732,5,B00ME8EPMU,"This documentary is a ""MUST WATCH"" for every American.  We all owe an amazing debt to the greatest lawyer in American history -bar none.  Thurgood Marshall should be on our currency and honored for making Civil Rights a reality for all of us.  He used the ""separate but equal"" doctrine to force schools to integrate and has argued the most cases before the Supreme Court of any lawyer in American history and won all of them!  If any one of us is descriminated against we all can be.  His contribution is so impressive and his risks and sacrifices with nearly no hope of living to see another day let alone prevailing but he did!  His wife, his sons, they all deserve our thanks as well for the sacrifice of their husband and father as well.  The cinematic quality is first rate and the story is told in a riveting and understated way to keep you thinking and as the history unfolds you keep thinking...""look at how much he accomplished"" and then you find out that he topped that...through the entire film.",1514246400,5,1006,4.524861878453039
