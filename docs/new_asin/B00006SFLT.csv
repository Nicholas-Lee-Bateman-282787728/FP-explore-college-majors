7973178,5,B00006SFLT,"Alright, first off I know that this is not the 80's Metal video with Slayer, Venom etc. I love the old stuff but this ain't it. What this DVD is is GREAT!!! What you get is 1 DVD and 1 CD of all Polish Death/Black  Metal bands!!! The DVD:  Vader, Decapitated, Behemoth, Sceptic, Thy Disease, Trauma, Lux Occulta, Dominium, Belfegor, Dies Irae, Immemorial, Luna Ad Noctum, Hermh, Turbo, Yattering, Moon, Domain and Christ Agony!!! These are all GREAT bands and HIGH QUALITY VIDEOS!!! I own a lot of music DVD's; Beauty in Darkness series etc. but this is by far the BEST ALL DEATH/BLACK METAL DVD I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!  All killer No filler. European Metal at it's finest. The CD is great as well with a lot of unknown/up and coming Polish Metal bands. I don't want to sound redundant but this DVD will not leave your player! This is my first review, I had to review it because of the one star the other guy gave this because he was upset that it wasn't the ""original"" Ultimate Revenge from the 80's. Either way that guy should have enjoyed this DVD unless of course he is still stuck in the 80's and not open minded to the new black/death/thrash scene. I rest my case.",1057276800,3,1166,4.413953488372093
