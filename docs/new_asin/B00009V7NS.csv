The main story for episode 5 and 6 deals with the ghosts from the Kasuke uprising.  The Kasuke uprising was lead by a farmer named Kasuke on Matsumoto Castle to protest the taxes being raised from 83 pounds (the Edo period system of measuring rice) to 116 pounds which created a lot of hardships for the farmers and so naturally there were people who wanted to do something about these taxes.  The end result of the Kasuke uprising was that Kasuke and the other leaders of this uprising were tricked and executed. Saori's middle school was built over the area that Kasuke and the others were executed at.  When their remains were discovered and the history behind their deaths learned they were given a proper burial and so their vengeful spirits became guardian spirits; however someone has used spiritual guidance to send these spirits from Saori's middle school to Takaya's high school.  They have also been turned into vengeful spirits and have been haunting Takaya's high school and several students have been injured in the process.  It is then up to Takaya and company to find out who is responsible for this.
In episode 7 Takaya has spent his summer exercising spirits with Naoe.  Their latest journey takes them to Uozu City.  Takaya starts to have images in his head of events in the past but can't quite make sense of it.  He also learns that 400 years ago during the battle of Otate Naoe fought on the opposing side.  He fought on the side of Lord Kagekatsu. Eventually they arrive at Uozu castle were the vengeful spirits of the Ikkoshu have been attacking Uozu castle.  Their presence has attracted the Uesugi 13 Generals.  There's a lot of history behind all of this explained in the anime so if you want to know I suggest you buy this DVD.
Even though all of this action is going on and beautifully animated battles ensue the writers thankful left time to focus on the character relationships and some of the dilemmas they face as possessors such as the guilt of forcing out the spirits of a live person so that they can take over the body.  They also have to contend with some of the mistakes that they made in their past lives and how it continues to affect them.  I found all of this to be very pleasing especially the new developments in Takaya and Naoe's relationship.  Overall, another really good volume.",1064966400,14,2416,4.654117647058824
