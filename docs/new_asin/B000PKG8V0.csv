8191988,1,B000PKG8V0,"Since Classic Media owns the rights to these particular Godzilla films, it is obvious that this is not a legitimate release. I'm surprised it even made it to Amazon.com.

If you want inferior, public domain TV prints, that is probably what you're getting here. If you want DVD quality and legal versions of these films, get the Classic Media discs.",1185753600,7,348,4.8
8191989,1,B000PKG8V0,"Not to criticize this latest edition to the Godzilla series (I wouldn't know what to review), but how can Amazon expect a customer to pre-order this dvd when there is absolutely no product detail other than the fact that there are 2 discs, the running time is 400 minutes, and it's being released in July? NOT A GOOD IDEA, AMAZON! ULTIMATE ERROR!",1183161600,14,346,4.596774193548387
