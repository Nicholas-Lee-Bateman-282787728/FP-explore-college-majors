1919131,5,B0000CG8B1,"I was very concerned about how the series was going to end. At the end of seven, it seemed like their was still a lot to be answered. Although eight doesn't technically answer them all, if you think about what you have seen it does. This final volume also had a wonderful ending (which is rare in a lot of anime's now adays). The ending remained consistant with everything they had been saying. Everything they predicted did happen. Just not exactly the way they expected it. People who like overly lovey dovey endings should stay clear of this. Make up an ending for yourself or something because the ending is generally sad, but it does have a slight joy to it.",1070841600,,663,4.487603305785124
1919132,5,B0000CG8B1,"This has got to be one of the best anime series I have ever seen. When I first purchased ""X one,"" I had no idea what I was getting into. I was immediately hooked on it.
""X eight"" will leave you satisfied, but the fact that the ending is not the typical ending our society is used to, it leaves you with a sense of unease (which, to me, is all good). Great series overall!",1070755200,,371,3.96
1919133,5,B0000CG8B1,"From the very beginning, X had me in its pocket. By the time I reached this last volume, I was on pins and needles to find out what would happen.
Each successive episode of this too-short series gives the viewer that much more time to fall in love with the characters, so it's no wonder that all my favorite characters are mysteriously alive at the beginning of this disc. Since it's CLAMP, since it's X, the reality of a bloodbath is inevitable. Rather than feeling rushed or slapped-together, to me the abruptness of some of the action seemed like a Japanese way to end the series. Some characters have to accept their fate so that others can change what was thought to be inevitable.
I only know the anime, not the manga, so I can't compare one to the other. However, taken on its own, X the TV series gives a satisfying, if not exactly happy, ending.",1070064000,4,854,4.445859872611465
1919134,2,B0000CG8B1,"Wow, talk about rushed.  It seemed as if the anime director was in the biggest hurry to wrap this up that there was no consideration towards the longings of the audience.
Now because I'm a manga purist, I'll TRY my damnedest to rate this entirely separately.  Why?  Because, in the end, it's SO EXTREMELY DIFFERENT from the manga that it, like the movie, must be taken entirely in its own context.  There's NO CHANCE to compare them any longer.
First off, the fight sequence between Kamui and /Kamui/ could have been a LOT longer.  It was very short.  Nicely animated, explosive, and set in lovely backgrounds with lots of splitting beams, yes, but too damned short.  There could've been a whole lot more delving into each character's personal crisises, as well.  Rushed entirely.  And too many twitching eyeballs made me shudder a bit - that in of itself rather squished my opinion towards the grandure of the animation quality.
Kamui's Japanese voice actor didn't do the end scene very well, either, in my opinion.  He could've put a bit more emotion into it.  And I don't EVEN want to know how the English doofus did - I avoided that viewing experience entirely.
My favorite part of this ENTIRE volume was... well, knowing my tastes and how much I adore the Sumeragi Twins....
That's right!  HOKUTO-CHAN!!!  *glompityglomp*  She's a superb little twist in this thing.  Gaw, I love this girl!  However, I DO hate that the anime director decided to simply redraw the end of *censored* Tokyo Babylon.  How many times can Onmyouji Boy go catatonic, for God's sake?!
All in all, it was far too rushed and trying too hard to accomplish the same levels of pure angst that Clamp has created through, what is it now, 18 volumes with almost enough new stuff in Asuka to make a 19th?
So now that I've stated why the anime itself sucked (piss-poor animation when compared to industry standards like Neon Genesis Evangelion, the X movie, even Vision of Escaflowne and Tokyo Babylon for crying out loud with the sole exception of the battle sequence, poor voice acting on Kamui's seiyuu's part, pretty pathetic attempts to make you sniffle and very, very rushed ending considering most anime series encompass 26 episodes and they put out this bastard in 24), let's NOW compare it to the manga.
For you purists like me...
Let us all simply start spazzing now.  The differences made me shudder and convulse.  No return of the Sakurazukamori, no conglomeration of people at the Promised Day (most of 'em already freakin' died, for crying out loud!), Kazuki's wish is turned ENTIRELY on its head, and only ONE EPISODE with an entirely Evil Hinoto(tm).  Sorata doesn't face off with who he's supposed to face off with *glomps the last volume of Asuka that X actually came out in and cries*.  Subaru isn't in his spiffy black trenchcoat with his new mismatched eyes.
I'm running off to scream now.
Nice music, pretty artwork, and a wonderfully animated albiet far too short battle sequence.  In of itself, a good li'l anime with a nice little twist to the end that makes you smile.
Not enough to make up for the sheer disappointment of the series when compared to the manga.",1069977600,,3157,4.73308957952468
1919135,4,B0000CG8B1,"These final episodes of the series are good, but not great.  I won't give away the ending but it definetly gives the feel that the writers weren't really sure how to pull everything together to get a conclusion one way or another.  The action is amazing, and the graphics are, as always, superb.  I would recommend it to anyone viewing the series because, well, it's the end.  Maybe you'll get more understanding about the resolution than I did.",1069286400,,445,4.666666666666667
1919136,5,B0000CG8B1,"This is the last volume of the epic tale of the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth. These are the last and best 3 episodes of the X TV series done by the genious team of Clamp. Characters from both sides battle strong to defend what they believe in. The Final Battle will commence between Fuma and Kamui. Will Kamui fulfil his wish and bring Fuma back? Will Sorata's fate come to pass? Will Arashi and Sorata fight for that wish?
All questions will be answered. The ending of X was the best ever! There's sadness, joy, love, and much more that will take your emotions to their peak. This is definitely a DVD you can't miss. If you've already bought all the other dvds as I have, it's only logical to complete the saga. If you haven't, get into it! X is a very philosopical, violent, and beautiful anime that has very diverse characters with powers and love in their lives. Being on opposite sides causes problems. Feelings of humans and of the earth clash, and cause confusion within every person participating. Check it out!
Clamp is the best out there, and XTV is definite proof ov that.",1068422400,,1097,4.462686567164179

Kamui unveils the true Divine Sword, and confronts Fuma one last time to determine the future. Can their really be a winner to a battle where to best friends fight to the death? After the final battle will anyone be left to witness the new world?

This is an excellent series. It has action, drama, and suspense. The animation, plot, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. There are also lots of great characters and plot twists. I try to be objective and think of just 1 bad thing to say about this series, but I can't. This is an all around incredible story. CLAMP has done it again! This is a must see for every anime fan.",1355184000,,772,4.361111111111111
7999246,5,B0000CG8B1,"I was a little worried that the product might not be what it seemed to in the description above.  I had lost the last volume of the collection and was looking for an identical version to replace my missing volume.  My package arrived just when it said it would.  I watched the whole DVD through to make sure there would be no problems.  This item was exactly like the one I had lost.  It worked perfect, it's in very good condition and I think it was a steal for $4 (which included the shipping.)  I definitely am glad I made this purchase!",1352073600,,540,4.245098039215686
7999247,5,B0000CG8B1,There was no misrepresentation about this product and I truly enjoyed it.  The disc did not skip so I could see the final chapter of X without interruption or delay.,1232755200,,165,4.5
7999248,5,B0000CG8B1,"The outline that follows is an outline that refers to the entire series and spoilers will be included.

To begin with, if you are looking for an anime that is more in the style of Love Hina, than you should skip this one. If on the other hand, you are looking for an anime that is powerful, emotional, has love/romance, great character development and strong story, than you are definitely right here.

Outline of the story:

The story resolves around the Seven guardians of Heaven and the Seven guardians of Earth. The one group wants to preserve earth as it, believes in humanity no matter what they have done to earth, and hope for a better future. The other group wants to erase humanity from the face of earth so that the planet and its other creatures can life in peace etc.

The `problem' is that when watching the show you will - like it or not - agree with both groups (not to mention the fact that there is no `black - white answer' but a grey version (You will have to watch it in order to understand or otherwise I will give the entire show away, sorry guys)). Apart from it, the age of the group members does not matter much; meaning that you will see in both groups' teenagers and adults fighting side-by-side or against each other till death. Others will fight against the other group for their own personal reasons.

The biggest problem however is that there can be only one Kamui (chosen one) and the side he decides to follow will win; but, it proofs that the real Kamui has a twin star, meaning that there is another Kamui out there as well. This will lead to an explosive mixture of emotions. Lovers, who will belong to the opposing group, will be forced to fight till death against each other, brother against brother, best friend against best friend and so forth. To be honest, the story will get very emotional indeed. No matter the age, the group members will fight and die.

As for the action, you will get more than enough. To begin with, the fights occur in both astral plane and our materialistic world. In order to prevent damages in our world, the group members are able to form a kind of a shield, in which most fights happen, and no matter the destruction our reality remains unaltered. That is, if the fights remain inside the shield, something that will not always be the case. In addition, all group members have their own supernatural `super powers' etc. For instance, some can use the five elements, some others are psychics, some others use magic, some take advantage of technology, some bend reality etc.

Who will win in the end and what will be the cost of this destructive victory?

The genre of this anime could be categorized under: fantasy, supernatural, action, and love / romance.

The music that accompanies the show is very well orchestrated and good. Starts with a rock/pop song and ends up with a melancholic ballad. In-between the music changes in accordance with the shows (very good done).

As for the dub, in my humble opinion, it is very good and professional done, in the same level as CB is done.

The animation is excellent.

As for extras, it has more or less the typical stuff: Textless opening and ending, previews, trailers etc.

As for the box-set: The first DVD comes with the box and every DVD you buy it fits in there; imagine it something like a shelf.

As for the story: It is very emotional, has great character development, solid storyline (that moves forth and back, with flashbacks etc.), many twists and is very mature and character driven.

Tip: The first episode, called X-0, of the first DVD is like a prelude and `summation' of the story. If you don't want anything to be given to you in front but want to be glued to your sits from episode one, that skip this one.

Last but not least, is it worth buying or not? In two words: Definitely yes! However, by collecting all 8 volumes the cost may raise around $200. To be honest, it is worth having in your collection but if the cost might seem to you as an obstacle than try to rent it and to watch it.  The show is highly recommended!

I hope that I could help you, if so than please click on the yes button below ^_^",1156118400,,4144,4.466225165562914
7999249,2,B0000CG8B1,"I really loved this series.  Everything lead to Fuma and Kamui in a final comfrontation.  What I thought would happen, was at least our hero finally awakening to his true power.  Instead we get some kind of love conquers the day event, which leave me feeling like I was cheated of a real good fight.  It's the only reason I rate the series so low.  To go through the series, and to get that little of a payoff is not good to me.",1110931200,,428,4.108433734939759
7999250,4,B0000CG8B1,"I loved the whole series it was great, the characters were all interesting. The only thing that angered me was that they built up this whole final battle thing and when it finally happened it was all of like 1 minute. Also it was one of those typical anime type endings with all the emotional you are in my heart along with this dead person and that dead person type of talk and suddenly the bad guys are defeated. Give me a break I want a real ending for once in an anime. All complaints about the ending aside this series was awesome.",1075075200,4,536,4.213592233009709
7999251,5,B0000CG8B1,This is a great retelling to Clamps X. I think that this story was very well done. Great CHaracter formation and also great story consept. The one thing I would probably complain about is all the volume were too short. 75 mintues wasn't that long to be telling such a wonderful story. Great Ending. I recommend this for everyone.,1072224000,2,329,4.593220338983051
7999252,5,B0000CG8B1,"This is the last volume in what has been a remarkable retelling of Clamp's original manga series.  The final apocalypse has come, and the two Kamui's (Kamui and Fuma) must face each other to decide the fate of mankind and the earth.  Building to this final struggle are a series of battles between the Dragons of Earth and Heaven.  Betrayal and counter betrayal crisscross until only these last two, the bearers of the dual aspects of the divine shinken, retain their powers.
I've been looking forward to this DVD for some time.  The original film completely bobbled the story from the manga, creating more confusion than anything else.  This series has managed to capture the essence of the manga, even while carving out creative ground for itself.  I wanted to see how the grim build to the finale and the finale upsurge as the last, true message of the story was delivered.  I can honestly say that director Yoshiaki Kawajiri has exceeded my own expectations.  While many great series have seen release in the U.S. this year, X is the closest to that indefinable perfection that anime strives for.
The story managed to retain its focus on Kamui's struggle with destiny and fate while polishing each of the characters on both sides of the conflict.  My worst criticism is that Fuma, Kamui's twin star, is painted too darkly.  While the Dragons of Earth believe that humanity must be destroyed if the Earth is to be saved, I feel that they should be frightening, but not black hearted or evil.  Of course, this is a quibble.  Kawajiri has chosen to highlight the dramatic difference between the sides, which enhances the impact of the end.  I certainly can't say that his interpretation of Fuma was a failure.
Unlike many other series who have shifted to Kabbalistic, Christian, Aztec, or other symbolisms to create an esoteric atmosphere, Kawajiri (and Clamp) have always depended on roots in Japanese mythic and occult processes.  This gives the elements of the story a sense of belonging which is often missing when the spiritual layer is only a thin veneer.  In any case, the story, acting, art, and music are all superb, with nothing being spared to make this a landmark production.",1072137600,13,2188,4.81283422459893
7999253,5,B0000CG8B1,"This is another beautifully animated, visually stunning volume of X TV.  The second episode which focuses on Sorata and Arashi may be the best episode of the entire series.  I loved this show as a whole and I will cherish my boxed set of it forever.  This is a must for fans of the series and I'd advise new fans to start from the beginning so these episodes have more emotional impact.  Well done CLAMP !",1071619200,2,405,4.2894736842105265
