709785,1,6303824498,old and really bad,1415404800,,18,3.75
709786,4,6303824498,I enjoyed this movie the acting was pretty good and so was the story.,1410652800,,69,4.0
709787,4,6303824498,I liked this a lot and even if you know the ending it is fun to watch and I will watch it again. I liked the acting and I want to look up Craig Nelson because I know he did some shows I liked. This is just a good solid action mystery and well done.,1388016000,,248,3.5272727272727273
709788,3,6303824498,"This I a good drama with good acting, but it moves slowly. It focuses on a detective who is charged with sexual harassment. More than half a dozen police officers have been killed, virtually all stabbed with a knife, and he and his new partner, a woman, need to find out who did it. He begins to suspect his new partner who he finds out has a psychological problem: she can't remember what happened to her during her two month marriage.  But did she do it? Complicating the matter is that he is falling for her.",1385337600,2,511,4.322916666666667
709789,3,6303824498,I enjoyed this movie and have watched it several more times since.  The special effects leave something to be desired but I enjoyed the story.  It has a good story and Michael Ironside is good in it.  His character experience change and realizations as the story develops.  You will especially like this movie if you are a fan of Michael Ironside.,1101340800,5,347,4.639344262295082
710065,3,6303824498,Stopped watching it.  Not great.,1483315200,,32,5.4
710066,1,6303824498,"Really dismal.  Lousy, lousy acting and clichd storyline and dialogue.  If watching young cops get stabbed to death and watching old cops be abusive and condescending to women is entertainment to you, this is the movie for you.",1482969600,,227,4.947368421052632
710067,5,6303824498,Lots of twists and turns. I enjoyed this.,1482105600,,41,4.25

710217,4,6303824498,"This was a Made-For-TV movie from 1994.  It amazes me that people criticize it because it doesn't meet their expectations for a current theatrical blockbuster film for 2016.  To criticize a 22-year-old film because it doesn't have special effects comparable to a current theatrical release?  Really?  Perhaps people should base their expectations on the genre and year of release and be a little more realistic.  For what it is, this is a decent movie.  Not so much a ""murder mystery"" a la Christie, more of a ""crime drama"" that is about par for other crime drama TV movies from the mid-1990's.  If that's what your looking for, it fills the bill quite nicely.",1472256000,3,660,4.787610619469026

710354,3,6303824498,Too much killing cops for me to like it. Those guys got what they deserved. They raped her because she was better at the gun range. That is pathetic.,1458518400,,149,4.172413793103448

710474,1,6303824498,I love a good murder mystery. This wasn't it. The premise was totally implausible and the acting -- I don't think you can call it that. Character development was nil and one never got to know or care about the main characters or the victims. A total waste of time.,1456617600,,264,4.3

710555,4,6303824498,"Good movie with a improbable premise, but nevertheless kept me wondering until the end wherein the explanation is given.  Always liked Ironside he's a good character actor and has been in possibly hundreds of moviesl  Worth watching to the end!",1454112000,2,244,5.075

710610,3,6303824498,"Police officers are being brutally murdered (with surprising ease) and the lead investigator, who is battling sexual harassment charges, is assigned a new woman partner.

710615,1,6303824498,"Before the Digital Age overflowed the commode of our collective worldview,  I always wondered if buzzard mange could be hatvested in sufficient quantity in order that it be mulched and manufactured into motion picture film stock.  Now I know.  Lion's Gate did it,  back about thirty years ago!  And they turned the messy stuff into a quasi-motion picture,  too.

 Unfortunately,  buzzard mange itself is virtually indistinguishable from everything and everyone in 'Probable Cause'...the entire outrageous production causes the eyes,  the nose,  and all the other (good heavens!) senses to rebel,  if the viewer does not quickly press a heavy pillow to the screen in hopes of smothering this monster before even greater damage is done.  Probable cause,  yes.  To leap from the top of a high building after letting this dreck into our brains.

Can hypnosis be used to induce selective amnesia,  I wonder?",1417996800,,902,5.152777777777778
