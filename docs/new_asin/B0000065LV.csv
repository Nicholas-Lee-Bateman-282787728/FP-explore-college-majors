7903772,1,B0000065LV,Avoid this DVD. It's a DVD-R of what looks like a VHS tape recording. Truly awful picture.,1516665600,,90,4.352941176470588
7903773,5,B0000065LV,Low budget but still good. one of the very first films to ever deal with the idea of nanites.,1515542400,,93,3.9473684210526314
7903774,4,B0000065LV,I always enjoy viewing this Argento film starring David Hemmings.  Wonderful.,1509840000,,77,6.0
7903775,3,B0000065LV,"This is a fun movie to watch however it has the look and feel of a TV pilot.

Joe Keyes (Michael Beihm) is hired to find a missing husband and help him kill someone. He does his job too well and finds himself involved a mystery that involved indestructible ice-cream men and only gets weirder from their.

However you will recognize the mystery and the bad guy (John de Lancie) from Star Trek. And the dialog as a substandard Sam Spade.",1503619200,,436,4.37037037037037
7903776,1,B0000065LV,I agree with the reviewer requesting to pull your head out of your butt. Incredibly bad movie..save yourself an hour and a half of your life. Don't bother with this.,1500681600,,165,4.533333333333333
7903777,1,B0000065LV,The only reason I have given this a one is that I tried to watch it on Amazon Prime TV  and GUESS What  The movie they describe here and the Movie Poster seen here IS NOT THE MOVIE ADVERTISED.  I wound up seeing some idiotic English movie about a drunk homosexual piano player that experiences a murde.,1499299200,,302,4.2631578947368425
7903778,3,B0000065LV,It was wild,1483315200,,11,3.0
7903779,1,B0000065LV,when i bought this i thought it was the argento film but its just some 90's sci-fi action with some bad 3D effects,1171497600,,114,4.0
7903780,2,B0000065LV,"this whole movie was.... well...about red.

The concept sounded interesting since I like sci-fi and fantasy movies. Deep red is a substance that can make you immortal. A little girl has it in her body, and there are evil scientists who are out to get her. Even this simple storyline could have been made so much more interesting if (1) they did not spend a major portion of the movie just using the word ""deep red""... it sounds cheesy after a while (2) the action scenes were better shot (3) they added some sidelines to the story rather than continuing with the monotonous main thread.",1137715200,2,586,4.580952380952381
7903781,5,B0000065LV,"This movie demands your full attention from beginning to end!  If you blink, you'll miss an intricate detail in this well crafted science fiction thriller.  Michael Biehn's absolutely brilliant protrayal of the main character, Joe Keyes, bonds you with Keyes until you think you're immersed in the action. John de Lancie, Star Trek's Q, plays the villian with credibility and style.  As the film splices it's way to its climax, all the pieces fall together and leave you amazed at the brilliance of the plot and it's stylish filming.  You'll want to hit the rewind button and rewatch it again with your eyes unscaled!  This film doesn't disappoint the first time nor the fifty-first time!",980640000,11,688,4.947826086956522
