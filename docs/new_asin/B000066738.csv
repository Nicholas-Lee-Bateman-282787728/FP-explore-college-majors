Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125
7961957,5,B000066738,"Vegeta has always been arrogant and unwilling to accept that another could rival his power. But the battle with Buu has made his place in the universe abundantly clear. He will always be one step behind Goku. Now that he has acknowledged this fact, he understands what it is that only he can do. He has the power to save the world, but he must forget his pride, and make a sacrifice.",1355875200,,383,4.333333333333333
7961958,5,B000066738,"This is definitely one of the best DBZ DVDs that you can buy.  There isn't any cheap fusion in this DVD.  Goku and Vegeta choose to fight alone vs. Buu and represent the true Saiyan race.
""How should we do it?"" says Vegeta.  ""How about the old fashioned way?"" says Goku.  And they start playing rock paper scissors to decide who fights Buu first.  Goku wins and starts to fight Buu.  He loses energy from his SS3 transformation and Vegeta goes and helps.  Then Vegeta gets beat up and Goku goes and helps him.  Goku wants to then gain energy for the spirit bomb so Vegeta then has to hold Buu off...But can he?
This DVD is nothing but nonstop action and oldskool Saiyan fighting.  This is definitely a MUST HAVE if you're a true or even a casual Dragonball Z fan.  It is the BEST DVD in the Kid Buu Saga.  Vegeta even shows his softer side in this.",1047254400,,848,4.2375

7961961,5,B000066738,"DBZ is almost finished. I think the dubbing in english has been excellent, and this VHS truly shows that.
It may seem just like any other VHS to you, but its very special. First of all there is tons of fighting. Most DBZ movies show the z warriors just play around with their opponents, but in this, they actually fight to beat majin buu, and not just to toy with him. When Vegetto fought Buu I was so pissed off because Vegetto had 5 million oppurtunities to blast Buu into oblivion, but it seems Vegetto had to be overly stubborn and ruin that chance. Now its up to Goku. Vegeta is of no use, and Hercule is pretty much screwed. However Vegeta is why this VHS is one of the best. He talks about how Goku has always beaten him and finally starts to realize that Goku is the greatest warrior, and he actually talks to Goku like they are friends. Since the first saga Vegeta has been stubborn but it seems he has changed, and the English version is truly awesome. I have seen the Japenese version over the internet and Vegeta shows absolutely no emotion. But in this VHS he is willing to have his life erased from existance to beat buu, and shows he is the greatest warrior, mabye not in strength, but in will power.
So go buy this VHS, if you like DBZ you will not be dissapointed",1042070400,2,1280,4.271604938271605
7961962,3,B000066738,I have been a true fan of Dragonball Z ever since 1999. I got interested in it through Funimation but some how now in 2002 I have come to hate funimation. if your goin to buy their over priced dvds atleast get it for the japanese and TRUE version!,1038441600,2,247,4.061224489795919
7961963,5,B000066738,"When you watch episodes like these you begin to realise why you like the Dragonball Z sagas. It has everything pain, action, feeling, a great story with twists,turns and everything else you wanted thrown into the mix. This DVD has 3 episodes on it:
 Battle for Universe Begins
 Vegetas Respect
 Minute of Desperation
I have this DVD right infront of me so I assure you these are the only episodes you get. Its a shame but that takes nothing away from this great DVD. Because the action you get is more than Worthwile.
This DVD is a must for all DVD fans. I will not tell you what happens but Vegeta finally shows that he is human after all, and accepts what has been obvoius all along. These episodes will not be shown on TV for several months, so if you wanna see what happens buy a piece of this excellent series and enjoy it again and again.
The next DBZ DVD's in this will be released in the new year:
 Kid Buu- Vegetas Plea
 Kid Buu- The Price of Victory
I can hardly wait =)....",1038182400,5,984,4.268817204301075
7961964,5,B000066738,"As Goku's powers fall and he can no longer fight Buu. All hope seems lost, just as Vegeta makes his final assumptions on how Goku is the strongest and how he will never surpass him. Vegeta finally steps in and attempts to hold off Buu. But it appears he won't last long. As Vegeta's powers crumble and Buu is about to destroy him Goku seems to have healed a bit and saves Vegeta.
Goku in SSJ3 again wants to finish the battle as soon as possible so Vegeta needs to stall. Goku continues to prepare his spirit bomb but can Vegeta hold out long enough to allow goku to create the massive energy ball?
As Vegeta is about to fall again it seems nothing can save him. Goku cannot because if he attempts the spirit bomb will be destroyed from lack of concentration. All of the sudden the last man you would expect; he man who you thought wasted time on dbz comes to save Vegeta none other than the great Hercule. Buu try's to kill Hercule, but cannot because the Fat Buu inside of Kid Buu will not allow him.
Kid Buu wages war with Fat Buu in his body and Vegeta goes to the re-born Earth ( earth was wished back and so were the people with the dragon balls from namek and Earth) and pleads with the people to raise their hands and give Goku their energy. But Vegeta being an unknown is ignored so he needs a real hero to make the people make the people do what is said. But at the same time Fat Buu is getting torn to shreds will Vegeta have enough time??? Find out on Dragon Ball Z!!!!",1037145600,6,1481,4.16376306620209
