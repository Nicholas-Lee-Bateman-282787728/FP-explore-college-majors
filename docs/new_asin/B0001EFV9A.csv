1993259,5,B0001EFV9A,"LA FLEUR DU MAL is Claude Chabrol at his best: this is a bizarre, convoluted French mystery told with such finesse and aplomb that it feels more like sitting down to fine French cuisine rather than just viewing another foreign film.  But that is exactly what Chabrol is about - respecting the intellect as well as the curious mind and eye.
Set in a small town in France a family is slowly revealed to have a mysterious past with interfamilial marrying, murder, strange accidents, and political intrigues.  The mother Anne (Nathalie Baye) is running for town council, a career move which the father Gerard (Bernard Lecoq) finds objectionable.  Gerard's son Francois (Benoit Magimel) returns from America at the point that his stepmother Anne is campaigning and reunites with his stepsister Michele (Melanie Donley) in a love affair he has tried to avoid, not wanting to carry on the family tradition of 'inter-marrying'.  The one sane member of this family is Aunt Line (Suzanne Flon in an epic performance!) who has lived through it all and favors the current romance between Francois and Melanie for reasons that are made clear by story's end.  While this tale may sound a bit mundane, in Chabrol's clever hands it slowly develops into a mystery that is so well conceived that it knocks us for a loop.  All of the actors are outstanding, the musical score is subtle and right, the filming is impeccable, and the overall effect out-Hitchcock's Hitchcock.  For intelligent film making at its finest LA FLEUR DU MAL is a must see.  Highly recommended.",1083024000,9,1549,4.885496183206107
1993260,4,B0001EFV9A,"Claude Chabrol's new film ""The Flower of Evil"" easily ranks among the master's (and he is a master film-maker) best works. The territory may not seem new but there's something refreshing about that. Because we, Chabrol fans know he knows this genre very well. As time has gone by Chabrol has not lost his touch. ""The Flower of Evil"" marks Chabrol's 50th film! His first was ""Le Serge Beau"" (1958). For over 40 years Chabrol has been wooing French audiences with his Hitchcockian style of film-making starting the famous French New-Wave. In fact ""The Flower of Evil"" is one Chabrol's favorite films of his own. The other is ""The Story of Women"".
 Within the past year or so I've become a very big enthusiast of Chabrol's work. I loved his last film ""Merci pour le Chocolat"". I thought that was a wonderful throwback to his ealier days and films like ""Le Boucher"" & ""Les Biches"". But, I have to admit, I enjoyed ""Flower of Evil"" just the slighest bit more. There is so much to savor here. The wonderful way the screenplay (written by Caroline Eliacheff, Louise L. Lambrichs, and Chabrol himself) weaves so many themes at once but in a way where one idea doesn't seem to over-lap onto another. There are a lot of secrets buried here and Chabrol tells them with great energy.
 I always feel when dealing with certain stories it's best not to know anything about the film before seeing it. Some movies just need to catch the audience off guard. Play with your senses a bit. For example think of movies like ""Psycho"", ""The Crying Game"" and ""Mulholland Dr."" you really wouldn't want someone revealing the plot to you, would you? Usually mystery films require you know almost nothing about the film before hand. So, in trying to somehow lure you into seeing the movie I can only supply a vague out-line of the film.
 ""The Flower of Evil"" starts off with the appearance of a dead body (go figure!). And from that point on are mind starts going to work. Who died? Who killed him? And will the blood leave a stain on the carpet? We meet Francois Vasseur (Benoit Magimel) and his father Gerard (Bernard Lecoq). And soon old family secrets are starting to be revealed. Anne Charpin-Vasseur (Nathalie Baye), now pay attention. She is Francois step-mother. Her first husband and Gerard's first wife died together in a car accident, so logically they married. Now Anne has a daughter Michele (Melanie Doutey) and she seems to have more then sisterly love for her step-brother. But, just so you are warned and you may find it hard to believe, it is not presented in a werid twist way. And naturally I really can't go on any further.

 ""The Flower of Evil"" is one of the year's best films. I hope many others come to enjoy this film as much as I did and not treat it as harshly as they did ""Merci pour le Chocolat"".
 Bottom-line: Master film-maker Claude Chabrol's 50th film is one of the very best of his impressive career. Also, one of the best films of the year. Wonderfully written, superbly acted, and stylishly directed.",1068249600,3,3008,4.613084112149533
1993261,5,B0001EFV9A,"Claude Chabrol's ""La Fleur du Mal"" is as tightly structured as a Moliere comedy or a Shakespeare drama: nothing is left to chance, everything is accounted for, from the lampshade in a home office to the neatly stacked and folded shirts packed in a suitcase. Chabrol is also fastidious about his mise en scene: from the dcor and the photography to the clothing and jewelry.
Chabrol has focused his microscope on a family, riddled with the sins of their ancestors that once again come to the forefront in the form of a hate letter aimed at the mother, Anne (Nathalie Baye) during her bid for mayor in a small French provincial town. It's the middle class, the Bourgeoisie that Chabrol views with contempt here: their insistence on sweeping things under the carpet, their not talking about things better discussed and their fascination with those with more money and a better lineage.
Despite the fact that most of these people are pretty despicable, guilty of the worst kind of betrayal, ""La Fleur du Mal"" is nonetheless fascinating to watch as Chabrol pieces his story together, layering scene upon scene, dissecting and surgically removing all the false faces and peeling away the fake smiles.
Benoit Magimel (The object of Isabelle Huppert's affection in ""The Piano Teacher"") as Francois and Melanie Doutey as Michele add sexual heat to the surroundings and also a clear dislike for what is going on. But I think Suzanne Flon as the eldest member of the family is the one who really holds the film together: her portrayal of Tante Line has seen it all, literally and has used her experience wisely by turning it into wisdom not archness or conceit.
""La Fleur du Mal"" is Chabrol at his best, at his smartest, at his shrewdest and as such begs viewing by anyone interested in Contemporary film.",1066867200,,1793,4.805825242718447
8011080,4,B0001EFV9A,"Over the years, specially in his last stage, Claude Chabrol focused by revaling the existentail boredom in the upper class. We may cite L'enfer or Chocolat for instance, in hich the psychological tension was the main ingredient but never at the level of Que la bete meure or The butcher in the early seventies.

And if I had to cite the first film in which Claude is concerned with the inner demons, this would be ""Innocent with dirty hands"" from 1975. Once more Chabrol mirrors the unsaid family secrets that hide major sins. The members of his disfunctional family turn around the imminent election of Nathalie Baye and the unpleasant factors that surround this familar drama, where the mistery, the irony and the lack of ethic permeate their way of living.

Slow paced movie whose staging might perfectly fit with a teatrical production. Specially recommended for Chabrol's buffs.",1311033600,,883,4.95945945945946
8011081,2,B0001EFV9A,"The Flower of Evil (Claude Chabrol, 2003)

Slow drama (listed as a drama/thriller at IMDB, but the ""thriller"" portion never emerges) about three generations of a politically-active French family and their dalliances in love, politics, and the occasional murder (in the past, anyway). Every review of it I've read since watching the film has mentioned that this isn't Chabrol's best work. Good, because it's my first exposure to him, and I can't see what all the fuss is about at all. Some very good acting, as befits a top-notch cast (Nathalie Baye, Benoit Magimel, Jerome Bertin, Bernard le Coq, Melanie Doutey, etc.), but the Chabrol/Eliacheff script doesn't give the acting much to hang on, especially when a number of these characters are stock (how many overly-ambitious politicians does the film world need?). Some potential here, and some of the points Chabrol raises are interesting from an academic standpoint, but I never found myself connecting with any of the characters save Bertin's, and he was only around toward the end of the movie for comic relief. I'll head back into Chabrol's catalogue and see some of the films he's been much more praised for; hopefully they're better. **",1263600000,,1194,5.060913705583756
8011082,4,B0001EFV9A,"""The flower of evil"" (= ""La fleur du mal""), directed by Claude Chabrol, is centered on an upper middle-class family, the Charpin-Vasseurs. This family seems perfect but has dark and deep secrets, as seen from the very first scenes of this movie. What is wrong with the members of this family? Chabrol's mission is to make us care about the answer to this question...

The story begins with a crime, and continues many years later, when Francois Vasseur (Benot Magimel), returns home after spending four years in the United States. Grard (Bernard Le Coq), his father, is happy to see Francois again, but disturbed by the fact that his wife Anne Charpin-Vasseur (Nathalie Baye) is involved in politics and running for mayor. Francois doesn't have a very good relationship with Grard, but is pleased to see his stepmother Anne, his aunt Line (Suzanne Flon) and specially his stepsister and first cousin Michle (Melanie Doutey).

Truth to be told, Francois left France because he had strong feelings towards Michle, feelings she reciprocated. Is he now ready to act on those feelings? And what impact will that relationship have on the dynamics of his family, already disturbed by Anne's incursion into politics and old scandals that surface again? ""The flower of evil"" answers these questions, and tackles subjects such as the cyclical nature of life, the importance of secrecy in some lives, guilt and the need to keep up appearances (""il faut faire belle figure"").

All in all, I think that this film will interest those who are fond of whodunnits, but that can also appreciate complex psychological studies that make a movie more interesting. Of course, recommended.

8011083,3,B0001EFV9A,"La Fleur du Mal aka The Flower of Evil isn't quite Chabrol on auto-pilot, but he's clearly more interested in the usual bourgeois side issues than the identity of the author of an anonymous leaflet that threatens Natalie Baye's campaign to become mayor of a small town by raking over the coals of the family's history of murder and Nazi collaboration. History is obviously going to repeat itself, but there's no sense of impending dread, merely a feeling that Chabrol has left himself too little time to remember the plot and wrap it up. Thus we get a somewhat hurried finale that feels practically like an afterthought - you can almost imagine him looking at his watch and thinking ""Is that the time? I'd better kill someone so we can all go home."" It's at its best dealing with local politics and petty ambitions on the campaign trail, and Baye and Suzanne Flon have the best of the film, but Chabrol's reunion with La Ceremonie scripter Caroline Eliacheff seems far more a time-filler than an essential.",1165190400,2,1006,4.721590909090909
8011084,4,B0001EFV9A,"This is a pleasant film by Claude Chabrol, nothing like the forbidding title ""La Fleur du Mal"" would suggest.  I say pleasant in that there is nothing gross or ugly about it or really shocking, and it ends in a way that most viewers would find agreeable.  There is some dark suggestion of family evil and a kind of playful non-incest and some skeletons in the closet from the Nazi occupation and one dead man at the end, but otherwise this is almost a comedy.

It is not, however, in my opinion his best work, but is very representative.  My favorite Chabrol film is Une affaire de femmes (1988) starring Isabelle Huppert and Francois Cluzet.  I also liked La Crmonie (1995) featuring Sandrine Bonnaire, Isabelle Huppert and Jacqueline Bisset.  Both of these are much darker works than The Flower of Evil.

As in many Chabrol films this starts slowly but manages to be interesting thanks to some veracious color and characterization blended with a hint of the tension to come.  And then, also characteristic of Chabrol, there is a interesting finish.

Nathalie Baye plays Anne Charpin-Vasseur, who in her fifties decides to run for mayor.  Her philandering husband Grard (Bernard Le Coq) is not pleased.  Benoit Magimel plays the prodigal son Francois Vasseur, just home after four years in the US, while Melanie Doutey plays his non-biological sister Michele.  Francois apparently ran away to the States to cool his growing attraction to Michele (to her disappointment).  Now on his return their love blooms.

This is very much approved of by Aunt Line (played wonderfully well with spry energy by Suzanne Flon who was 85 years old when the film was made).  Their affair reminds her of her youth, a mixed blessing since she lived through some horrors.

The main plot concerns the opposition that Anne is getting as she runs for mayor.  A leaflet accusing the family of collaboration with the Nazis during WWII is distributed that threatens to derail her campaign.

See this for one of France's great ladies of both film and the theater, Suzanne Flon, who died last year after a career than spanned five decades.",1138492800,8,2112,4.835654596100278
8011085,4,B0001EFV9A,"The end left me in the always uncomfortable, ""that's really it?"" zone?

But, I still really liked it:  The french pacing.  The odd Aunt Line.  The pretty daughter & kinda cute son thing.  I love run on film credits.

Incest?

Nazi's?

Hinted, never really explained.

I don't need all the cards on the table.  Ambiguity rocks.  But this wasn't ambiguity, it was unfinished.

I did enjoy it though.  What are you going to do?",1134259200,,424,4.5675675675675675
8011086,4,B0001EFV9A,"While there is not a lot of tension and suspense in this movie, it is a pleasure just to watch the acting. Every character is beautiful, even the aged Tante Line. One thing that I enjoyed was how the character of Tante Line was used. Not only was she integral to the story, but the director had the camera linger on her still-beautiful elderly face much more often than any American director would have. It made me long for my grandmother, and wish she had been such an important and constant part of my life.

Whatever the intentions of the director, I came away liking all but one of the main characters. It seemed we were being set up to dislike most of them, but the director then fooled us by showing them as sympathetic humans.",1121644800,2,733,4.389705882352941
8011087,3,B0001EFV9A,"Overall, The Flower of Evil was a very entertaining movie, but I couldn't have helped and become a little disappointed because of the fantastic trailer. The film was advertised as a very complicated, complex mystery, but it was actually quite simple. The story was a very good one, intriguing and exciting, but it seemed like the writer didn't have any ideas on how to flesh it out and add some mystery to it.

The Flower of Evil tells the tale of a French Bordeaux bourgeoisie family with a family tree like a Los Angeles freeway map and a history of evil doings which doesn't really have anything to do with anything. As this film rolls along with the day-to-day business of the mother running for local civic office while the step-sibs falling in love and granny putters around the garden, one can only wonder what, if anything, is being developed. When the end credits roll unexpectedly one can only wonder what Chabrol had in mind and why it was never really brought into clarity of fruition at the end. The wonderful story seems threadbare and almost nonexistant and the family history seems pointless.

I felt a bit cheated and let down when the film was over, but I wouldn't dismiss it because of that. I really enjoyed the superb acting by the top-notch cast, fine character development, and otherwise gripping story. Maybe some of the subtlety was just lost on me, but I liked the fact that you're never sure who's good or bad, and end up feeling for each character anyway. I am unfamiliar with any of Claude Chabrol's other works, but after seeing this film, I am definitely curious to check out some more. Not sure if I would recommend this, but personally, I thouroughly enjoyed it, as unsatisfying as it was.",1091404800,10,1722,4.661184210526316
8011088,5,B0001EFV9A,"really good suspenseful movie that is more exciting than most american mystery movies, except for the a few hitchcock movies. i really enjoyed this one and it's one of a few foreign movies i like.",1088812800,4,196,4.628571428571429
8011089,3,B0001EFV9A,"What saves this film--noticeably weaker than a number of other Chabrol efforts--is the acting.  Veteran actress Natalie Baye is superb here, as is the actress playing her Aunt Line, Suzanne Flon.  Also notable are Benoit Magimel and Melanie Doutey as the two young lovers.
While the actors all turn in solid performances, the plotting and story leave something to be desired.  Chabrol specializes in the corruption of the well-to-do and how the lower classes conflict with those above them.  This conflict can result in superb filmmaking (La Ceremonie, La Rupture, Les Biches).  But this film is decidedly lopsided; with its essentially single focus--corruption and guilt--it lacks the dramatic punch and juice found in the other films cited here.
One can explore these themes (guilt and corruption) and certainly generate a powerful piece of drama.  But Chabrol seems to be comfortable when they are inextricably tied to class conflict and when they are not, as is true here, he does not dig deep enough to make these themes as strong as they should have been to elicit real emotional intensity.  What we have instead is cinema that slickly skates on the surface of these two related issues--corruption and guilt--without really plunging into the basis, the repercussions, the intricate complications they can generate.
Without revealing too much, a woman running for mayor focuses on getting out the vote, while her lecherous husband goes after young women--two in particular.  Meanwhile, the husband's son--recently returned from America--and the wife's daughter (the husband and wife are each on a second marriage; hence the two younger people are half-siblings) fall hard for each other.  Add to that a dark secret the woman's aunt has kept to herself for decades and there's the elements of the plot.
The climax is weak because the momentum generated is just not sufficient to result in any real emotional payoff.  One of the above characters may receive his/her just desserts, but they don't count for much because there is essentially a humdrum development on display here.
Too bad.  If Chabrol had added his signature element of class conflict he could have subverted the essentially superficial sheen of the film as it is with enough push and pull to make it really interesting.  One can still admire it for the actors but not as a thrilling piece of dramatic cinema.",1087862400,9,2377,5.097938144329897
