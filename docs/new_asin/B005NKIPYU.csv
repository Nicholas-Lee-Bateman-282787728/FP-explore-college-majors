4847839,5,B005NKIPYU,"I know this is a re-release of a concert that's about a decade old now, but I never saw the original, so this was a new show for me, and it turned out to be a real treat.  Amy Grant opened the event with 3 good tunes, including Baby Baby.  Then Peter Cetera took over, singing his big hits as a solo artist, as well as a few from his Chicago days.  Both artists were in good voice.  Cetera had a large orchestra accompany him, giving a different, fuller sound to some of his songs.  Blu-ray really enhances the viewing experience.  The only thing I found annoying to watch is Peter Cetera's tendency to jerk his head after singing a few words, which he did so often. Other than that distraction, I'm happy with my purchase and will definitely be watching it again soon.",1329868800,,769,4.305555555555555
4847840,4,B005NKIPYU,"The concert is excellent. My only dissapointment was that being released in blu ray format I was actually expecting additional footage or bonus materials but unfortunately this blu ray release has omitted one song Hard To Say I`m Sorry which is found on the normal DVD format. With the blu ray format, additional space could have catered for more bonus material. What happened?????. Thats the only reason this is getting a four star review.",1328227200,14,440,4.95945945945946
4847841,4,B005NKIPYU,Peter Cetera without Chicago and Chicago without Peter Cetera just doesn't have the sound and the chemistry that I expected. I have both this blu ray as well as the Chicago blu ray and you can tell that the sound is just short especially on the vocal part. Amy Grant was great. I cannot understand why 25 or 6 to 4 and Hard to Say I'm Sorry were not featured in the main concert when they were 2 of the best pieces in this concert.,1327449600,,431,4.08235294117647
4847842,5,B005NKIPYU,"""Peter Cetera with Special Guest Amy Grant: Live"" is a re-release of an earlier Soundstage blu-ray concert.

Amy Grant opens the show with three songs, at about 14 minutes.

Baby Baby
Simple Things
El-Shaddai

Peter Cetera's show is about 40 minutes.

One Good Woman
Glory of Love
Restless Heart
If You Leave Me Now
After All (duet with Kim Keyes)
The Next Time I Fall (duet with Amy Grant)
Baby, What a Big Surprise
You're the Inspiration
Have You Ever Been in Love

I especially enjoyed El-Shaddai.  Ms. Grant sang it in a reverential, spiritual, thankful, soulful and praiseful fashion.

Mr. Cetera was mellow and enjoyable.

The concert features a large orchestra and a variety of instruments, including the harp, horns, strings, wind instruments, guitars, keyboards/piano, egg shakers, tambourines, and percussion/drums with cymbals.

The main concert with Mr. Cetera has more of a classical music flavor rather than a Chicago style, with the instruments being more refined, complementing and highlighting Mr. Cetera's vocals.

The total time for this concert is about 54 minutes, so it goes by fast, and I wish it were a little longer, with a few more songs.

The blu-ray includes two bonus tracks at 9 and half minutes.

25 or 6 to 4
Even a Fool Can See

The two audio options are DTS-MA 5.1 Surround and LPCM Stereo.",1323475200,25,1324,4.883408071748879
4847843,5,B005NKIPYU,"I put this on at a party last week and it really got it going.  The spinach dip disappeared in about twenty minutes.  We ran out of ginger ale before 8pm.  And I can't find the universal remote.  Thank you, Peter Cetera, for making me lose the universal remote.",1322092800,6,261,4.26530612244898

4847846,3,B005NKIPYU,"Beautiful orchestrations of Peter Cetera's and Amy Grant's best and beloved songs. It was shot beautifully as well. However, it would have been SO much better if they had retained Amy Grant's drummer and electric guitarist to play during Peter Cetera's set. The orchestrations, although beautiful, had major and noticeable holes in them, leaving you to insert the drum and electric guitar parts from memory--so it wasn't a complete and full musical experience. The pianist and rhythm guitarist were doing their best to keep the beat active, but it fell painfully short. And the omission of these two instruments were only highlighted because Amy Grant had those instruments in her opening set.",1442620800,2,693,5.196428571428571

4847868,3,B005NKIPYU,"I love Peter Cetera and Amy Grant, but the concert felt a little dull.  Great songs to sing to, but the production value was a little bit underwhelming.",1403136000,,152,4.428571428571429
4847869,5,B005NKIPYU,Amy Grant is a class act.  Perter Cetera sounds great!  Chicago who?  I bought this to replace the non-Blue Ray version.,1402444800,,120,4.619047619047619
4847870,4,B005NKIPYU,I agree with just about all the reviews.  Peter and Amy are great.  Excellent quality video and sound.  Great songs except one missing.  Too short.  But am I the only one that doesn't get the sound from the solo cellist on the last song in 5.1?  Can hear him on PCM but not 5.1,1402272000,,277,4.037037037037037
4847871,5,B005NKIPYU,"This is one of the most outstanding televised concert productions I have seen......extraordinary lighting, sound and camera work.  The production values are so good that this event almost has a 3-D visual effect.  The viewer really feels they are in the front row and center as Peter Cetera and Amy Grant both perform some of their best known works.  Grant is really the opening act.....the concert would have been so much more effective if Cetera and Grant co-starred as equals.  Nonetheless, you will be treated to thrilling renditions of Grant's ""El Shaddai"" and Cetera's ""You're The Inspiration.""

The musicians are backed by elaborate strings and horn sections.  It just doesn't get any better than this.

This has the PBS stamp of quality on it.....you will not be disappointed.",1400284800,,784,5.078125
4847872,4,B005NKIPYU,"Like the Title of this review, the Concert is good. The problem is the length of Peter Cetera portion of the concert. His length is not long enough. I wish they would of included as well the song:  It's hard to say I'm Sorry, this was disappointing. Even though, the picture quality of the Blu-Ray is great, the sound is pretty decent as well. I would recommend this Blu-Ray concert for anyone who really likes Peter Cetera.",1395619200,,424,4.5064935064935066

4847875,5,B005NKIPYU,"I MEAN BESIDES LISTENING TO PETER SINGING,ALOT OF THE OLD GREATS,AMY GRANT WAS ALSO FANTASTIC.

4847878,4,B005NKIPYU,I saw this on PBS a few years ago and decided to buy the blu- ray dvd.  It is a solid performance though not too original.  Sounds like the records.,1372118400,,148,3.9
4847879,5,B005NKIPYU,"The concert is phenomenal, especially in the Blu-ray format. His voice is still powerful and inspiring, even at age 60! The orchestra enhances the arrangements. I have over 100 concerts, and this is in the top three.",1371686400,,216,4.864864864864865
4847880,5,B005NKIPYU,Contains all his hits and very well produced.  Was not excited with Amy Grant's inclusion but it is short and worth the wait to see the Peter Cetera part.,1368489600,,154,4.310344827586207

4847885,5,B005NKIPYU,"Excellent concert, duet with Amy Grant is good although I think the duet with Kim Keyes in another concert is better. Wish Peter Cetera would tour Australia.",1358640000,,157,4.851851851851852
4847886,4,B005NKIPYU,A pitty that the classic song Hard To Say I'm Sorry is not included. Some may find him lack of stage charisma to lead the audience but I'm sure you'll sing along once you play it (which me and my wife did). The orchestra blend in so well the every song is so smooth and easy to the ears.,1356912000,,287,3.8813559322033897
4847887,4,B005NKIPYU,"I really like this DVD -- good music.  Couple of qualms, however.  If you watch it, watch it in stereo and 5.1 surround -- in stereo, the voices have an ""auditorium"" sound -- in 5.1, the singer's voice has no reverb and really doesn't sound as good.  Also, as much as I liked all of Cetera's songs with the full orchestra, he really needed to have a drum beat with it -- it really would have made it sound so much better.  But still, lots of good music and enjoyable.",1355875200,,467,4.155555555555556

4847891,5,B005NKIPYU,"What a pleasant surprise this concert DVD is!! It's all too common to get a recent concert DVD by an older singer doing beloved old songs, only to find out that the live performance is a disappointment. Not with this!! Mr. Cetera was nearly 60 when this concert was filmed, but he can still sing, hearing these songs live is a joy for this old Chicago/Cetera fan!! Special favorites include Next Time I Fall, with his original duet partner, Amy Grant. Also, After All, with his backing singer Kim Keyes, is beautifully done.
