4513767,5,B0050ACXCI,"This is an incredible movie. The lead actor (Vincent Gallo) is absolutely phenomenal. I don't want to give too much away, but he doesn't say a word this entire movie, and yet he carries the entire film. Very very few actors could have pulled this off. Excellent DVD. Plays fine in the USA. I enjoyed the special features after the film.",1318464000,3,336,4.524590163934426
4513768,5,B0050ACXCI,"Jack Nicholson said this was the best film of 2010. I'm not sure about that, but it is definitely a very well made, thought provoking film that provides a perspective of the war on terror from the other side. This isn't a Rambo style shoot em up film. It's an enigmatic movie and, in my experience, exceptional, powerful and poetic. A challenging film which plays strongly to subjectivity. If you need your movies spoon fed to you and don't want to do any thinking, this probably isn't the film to for you. As the protagonist, Vincent Gallo is amazing and its obvious why he won Best Actor for this role at Venice. It's the strongest performance I've seen by any actor in recent memory. Highly recommended. This DVD is excellent also. It is an import, but everything is in English, and it played just fine in my USA DVD player.",1317600000,4,827,4.52
4513769,1,B0050ACXCI,"No plot, no screen-play, sound-track gave me a headache.
Why did he make this film?
Had to watch it to the end to see if it got going. Do not waste your time!",1374192000,,158,3.8181818181818183
4513770,1,B0050ACXCI,"too slow -- did not wait for action to get started.  Do waste your time looking at this flopper, you will thank me.",1373932800,,115,4.0
4513771,5,B0050ACXCI,"Very much a provocative movie and subject material. Suspensefull.  How this man gets from a firefight in Afghanistan to wherever he finally arrives at, is a work of shear amazement.
A spellbinding movie!",1366416000,2,203,5.151515151515151
4513772,3,B0050ACXCI,"I did not like the ending,it kind of leaves you with a lot of questions about the main character. I did not like the movie as a whole.",1361923200,,134,3.8214285714285716
4513773,3,B0050ACXCI,"Maybe the best thing about this movie is not having to hear Vinny's whinny voice. Basically it's a silent film. For it's budget I guess it was fine, but what they were saying overall is kind of vague and they should have shown more of the evil water boarding and it's message would have been better understood and been a more powerful film.",1361059200,,340,4.412698412698413
4513774,2,B0050ACXCI,"The movie, although well acted by Gallo, far fits the description.  First of all, he has no problem killing anyone. So don't go by the synopsis that was written by someone who obviously didn't watch the film.  Second, the movie is mostly silent, so there's no dialog that helps you follow the story.  However, you soon realize dialog isn't needed because the film never provides a real story line or plot. For example, he flashes back to events from his past but no details or even background are shared. The flashbacks could have been left out of the film and we'd never know the difference.  This story is definitely not about war or politics. What this movie is really about is survival in extreme cold conditions.  Nothing more. So if you're waiting for an explanation of why he killed, what lead him to kill...you'll never get an answer.",1353196800,,842,4.662162162162162
4513775,1,B0050ACXCI,"Worst blu-ray I've bought since ""Cloverfield"".  I'ts about a ""detainee"" who escapes
custody and kills a few people to get what he needs to survive and get out of those orange jailhouse coveralls.  This blu-ray will be in the ""rag bin"" till my next garage sale.",1336176000,2,260,4.630434782608695
4513776,4,B0050ACXCI,"As a general rule war requires 1) the suppression of the consciousness' instinct of universal justice; and 2) the dehumanization of the enemy. The injustice done by the West in Afghanistan and dehumanization of the Taliban is a case in point. The war in Afghanistan has long, long ago passed the rubicon where it can judged as ""just"" by any measure. Whatever legitimate criticisms one may have of the Taliban are far superseded by what has become a raw imperial drive by the West to dominate that tortured land for other geo-political goals, with no regard whatsoever to the sanctity of human life on the ground. As example of just how far our dehumanization of the Taliban has gone, Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan and an ethnic Pashtun, was severely criticized for calling his and America's enemies amongst the Pashtun Taliban ""my brothers"". (Of course, the cozy relations between the Taliban and the US pre-911 are generally forgotten) Even among many Muslims, we see the dehumanization of the Taliban. And the Taliban have been guilty of dehumanizing others -- such as their fellow Afghan Shi'is -- as well.

In Essential Killing we are reminded of our shared humanity, our shared anguish over separation from our loved ones, and our struggle to survive and to return home. We are reminded that, as we dehumanize others, we need to gaze into the mirror of both our individual and national consciousness to see both the human and the beast within each of them.

The director --- no doubt and in part out of deference to anti-Muslim and Zionist sensibilities in the West -- plays down the political implications of this masterpiece. One wishes he could have been a bit bolder on this front; to bring more of the protagonist's roots, culture, and spirituality into the forefront of the drama. But those implications are inescapable, and the dynamic imagination can fill in the blanks.",1335139200,3,1896,4.9034267912772584
4513777,3,B0050ACXCI,"In Jerzy Skolimowski's ""Essential Killing,"" Vincent Gallo (""Buffalo `66"") is Mohammed, a man on the run from the American military in the middle of the desert and the snowy wilderness. Though Emmanuelle Seigner (""Frantic"") briefly appears, the film is about the survival of this art house-type Rambo played by thickly bearded Gallo. Not much is revealed about the man's past, which is suggested in several short flashback scenes and voiceovers.

Skolimowski makes his point in portraying the film's central figure as someone quite unheroic. Survival is his only goal and for that purpose he does anything including killing. Gallo's character (who doesn't speak a word throughout) acts and looks like a wild animal. We may be invited to share his grueling experience, if not asked to identify with him.

Skolimowski's concept of minimalist filmmaking (or making what is everything a typical Hollywood action film is not) is initially intriguing, but after thirty minutes or so the film begins to lose momentum, getting repetitious and running out of ideas. The film's ""breastfeeding"" scene looks just out of place. Also, to me the idea of Vincent Gallo as a Muslim soldier is not very convincing.

With all respect to filmmakers, I think ""Essential Killing"" is one of the examples of filmmaking style, that sound great in theory but turn out differently in practice.",1334188800,,1365,5.167420814479638
4513778,5,B0050ACXCI,"A visionary and masterful film. There is a story, it just isn't told in the same stock way. I think the story is a poetically-told and profound one. If you want Rambo with a turban and sneer at the idea of an ""art film"", then skip it. You won't know how to watch it and your commentary will be misplaced. If you understand that politics is elemental, consequential, and, yes, essential, and is more than ideologies and labels and bad guy verses good guy frames of reference, you could get something out of it. If you understand that politics isn't just parties or campaigns, but that 95% of it is what people don't see and don't ever know, you may like it. If you understand that politics is really (or had better be) ultimately about the planet, other life forms, seeing people whole, nature itself, and each man's soul, or at least have an open mind to seeing a more encompassing view of ""politics"", you might like it. Skolimowski's best, in my opinion, and that says a great deal.
Also, amazing acting by 2 leads, stunning direction and photography, Skolimowski gets better with age.",1334016000,4,1086,4.603092783505154
8450999,1,B0050ACXCI,"Slightly better than a root canal, this improbable movie is just a bloody waste of time and money. Don't even bother, it's not worth watching, no redeeming values whatsoever.",1465171200,,174,5.0344827586206895
8451000,1,B0050ACXCI,Terrible movie!!!,1455580800,,17,8.0
8451001,2,B0050ACXCI,Maybe I wasn't in the mood for it but I just couldn't get into this film. Vincent Gallo is an amazing actor but this just didn't do it for me.,1442793600,,142,3.7666666666666666
8451002,4,B0050ACXCI,"It was definitely not what I was used to in a thriller, but I have to say for  a movie that had maybe 10 minutes of dialogue
the story line was a psychological thriller at it's best, I'd watch it again, and again.",1419811200,,213,3.953488372093023

8451004,4,B0050ACXCI,"The film begins with U.S. troops attempting to kill or capture Taliban. The troops seem to act like juveniles thrown into a pointless war.  The captured Taliban are handcuffed and hooded and flown to Europe to be ""detained,"" possibly forever. An odd accident gives one of the Taliban an opportunity to escape - but ultimately he has nowhere to go. The man struggles to survive in the snow as long as he can and he kills people who threaten him. His final ride on a white horse seems to imply a somewhat heroic stature - two days a hunted but free man before his death - as opposed to a longer life void of any human dignity. The visuals and the sounds and the music are powerful.",1414627200,2,679,4.346456692913386
8451005,2,B0050ACXCI,"Well, it was like watching a national geographic documentary
with some action, and even less talking (even less from
the protagonist than Stalone in Rambo I).
The plot is simple. A man, kills 3 Americans on a mission of some
kind, he is catured, processed, tortured, and while he is transported
to some place, he escapes because of an accident.
And a survivalist story follows.
It is not a real plot though because in between the ""action"" the
movie goes into poetic mode, with great shots of nature, and music
that you would probably listen at ethnic food drive

But once you start watching it you want to see where it goes,
so you watch it till the end, not an easy task exept if you are
a multitasker

This is a movie for the ones that like artistic films, and here
you have one such move with its theme taken from the war on terror",1414195200,,834,4.339743589743589
8451006,5,B0050ACXCI,"Excellent film about an Afghan escapee in the wintery woods of Poland.
Yes, the pace of the film is not of a Hollywood standard , but this does not affect the intensity of the story. Some reviewers call this gripping film slow (when did that become a bad word?) :  a man runs for his life in a snow-covered landscape in a country unknown to him while being chased by a large number of soldiers who want him dead ; to survive he has to kill several people , sleep in the hay in a trough for deer, eat hallucinogenic berries and compete with a baby for his mother's milk. All of this in less than 48 hrs. Of course, there's a thunderous lack of explosions and dialogue. I guess in a world where we get served our daily dose of decapitations , and where the citizens of any mid-western town in America have to look into the barrels of police machineguns, films like these are just too tame.",1408579200,2,887,4.2485207100591715
8451007,3,B0050ACXCI,"Interesting that its set in Poland.  Sort of a story for the sake of telling a story about modern war.  US Soldiers are portrayed as brutish Stormtroopers which bothers me because its far from the truth.  I can say that as I've been there.  Politics aside its a kind of interesting ""what if"" survival story with an unusual setting.  No dialog.  Some questions that are not answered....we assume the woman the main character keeps seeing in his delusionary state is his wife but its never made clear.  We don't know if she is dead or not.  We also don't know why the character who he interacts with later in the movie takes the actions she does.  Much is just left to us to decide.  Kind of like modern art I guess...make your own interpretation.
The plain story of a guy in an alien and hostile environment trying to live another day is compelling....just don't put too much thought into it.",1385251200,,891,4.5125
8451008,4,B0050ACXCI,"I have been a Vincent Gallo fan since the movie Buffalo 66 which i still argue is one of my favorite Love Stories.  Having said that i watch anything that has Vincent Gallos name attached to it.  I will warn you if you are expecting a fast paced, action packed blockbuster, than you will not like this movie.  I cannot say this is a movie I will recommend to others.  I think it may be a matter of taste.  I think it is one of those movies I chose because as i have said, i am very interested in what this particular actor writes, directs or chooses to act in.  I guess i was expecting more because i have loved most of what i have seen from Vincent Gallos body of work.  This movie has almost no dialogue and moves very very slowly.  There is one scene in particular with a young pregnant woman that many may find disturbing to watch.  I do think the movie was trying to say many things about war and the amazing inner workings of most humans to do whatever it takes to survive.  I did think about this movie a number of days after watching it and that is usually a sign for me that i either liked it or learned something from it.  I think the best thing i can say is it is not a movie for those who would enjoy most of the movies showing at big complexes today - It is not for fans of Ironman or Family Guy - if you watch independent film this might be a movie you would like or at least leave you thinking about life in general.",1380585600,,1431,4.021201413427562
