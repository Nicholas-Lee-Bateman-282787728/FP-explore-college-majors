8109964,5,B000EHSCMM,"bought all three Volumes of Lary Coryell's jazz guitar. I have been playing guitar since 1991 so Volumes 1 and 2 I found to be less useful to me as Volume 3
I especially liked the part where he show the rolling arpegiatted harmonic technique. It's a really beautiful and interesting sounding trick to use with chords and producing harmonics with your pick hand. I recommend Larry Coryell, and Joe Pass for jazz guitar.",1266451200,,418,4.662162162162162
8109965,5,B000EHSCMM,"I want to supplement another main point with the comprehensive review provided by the first reviewer.  Toward the end of this DVD, Larry used the blues to start demonstrating jazz improvisation as blues is absolutely an essential form of jazz.  However, due to the length of the DVD, such exposition is not in detail.  A detailed exposition in this particular regard can be found in another Larry's book, entitled 'Jazz Guitar'.",1263686400,,428,5.0
8109966,5,B000EHSCMM,"Well this is a good place to start so long as you've been playing the guitar for a couple of years.  This isn't a beginners course and you'll need to know how to play barre chords and get around the scales a bit.  If you don't know how you soon will with these DVDs.  Takes you right from the start - how to warm up, what Larry does every day, scales and then into improvising around scales and harmonies.

As a player and teacher, I can tell you there's hundreds of guitar DVD out there (I've given up wathcing them now as there are so many bad ones it's a joke trying to review them all for students).  This is one of the best.  Larry is a great communicator and these DVDs are a very good source of materials if you want to get into fusion and jazz.  Players wanting to do the Satriani / Vai thing would do well to pay attention and see the sources of mauch of that style of playing here in fusion.  You don't have to finger tap all the time - you'll see some seriously fast conventional playing on this DVD.

Summary - an excellent DVD for studying the basics of jazz and fusion.  Try ""Non Nonsense Jazz Guitar"" by Jimmy Bruno as well.  Larry Coreyell's book, ""Jazz Guitar"" from Guitar Player publishing would go well with this DVD, although the DVD does come with a booklet and a full size 21 page one to download from the DVD's PDF file.  There's a lot of good work to be done here.",1200009600,4,1388,4.157303370786517
