8291708,5,B00009EPVV,"Tom Avery doesn't over-complicate things, nor does he oversimplify them. You can't wait to apply what you've learned!

I have the whole 8 DVD series of his called, ""Consistent Tennis Wins"", which I also recommend.

These DVDs deal with the:
Serve
Return of Serve
Backhand
Ability to Swing
Net Play
Singles & Doubles Tips
Specialty Shots (lobs, slice, etc) and the
Original

It costs more than others, because you get what you pay for! It's worth it, though it won't hurt to shop around for the best deal!",1201651200,,504,4.704545454545454
8291709,5,B00009EPVV,"Tom continues to provide ""Consistent"", excellent advice and instruction on improving your tennis play.  This video delivered immediate results for me.  If you cannot return serve, you will never get to play a point.  Tom explains how to effectively respond to serves from players of all levels.  He shows you how to respond to the serve and volleyer, a heavy topspin serve, a slice serve, a weak slow serve, and the big bomb serve.  Left hand serves are addressed as well.  With Tom's ability to break things down into simple instruction, improvements are realized immediately.  I have all 6 of Tom's tapes.  This one, as his others, contains a wealth of information that will enable you to reap immediate results.  Another Winner!  Thank You Tom Avery!",1057363200,,753,4.904761904761905
