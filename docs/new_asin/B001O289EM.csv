8328830,1,B001O289EM,DVD will not play.  Is this pirated or what?  I think it came from Thailand.  Does anyone know how I can get this thing to work?,1324771200,2,128,3.8461538461538463
8328831,1,B001O289EM,"This DVD will not play on normal DVD players (such as those sold in the United States). In addition to being badly over-priced and slow to be delivered, I should think that this would be a good enough reason not to purchase it. Personally, I was very disappointed, because Amazon offers no alternative for a DVD of this film, and I prefer to buy from Amazon; however, the movie is available from some other companies.",1310601600,5,417,4.573333333333333
8328832,4,B001O289EM,"I first saw ""Atlantis, the Lost Continent"" when I was a grade-schooler and have watched it repeatedly since -- it's not ""The Ten Commandments"" or ""Gone with the Wind,"" but it isn't meant to be.  Instead it's a fun, competent, entertaining movie that satisfies me every time I watch it.  This movie makes a good blend of fantasy, sci-fi, drama, and spectacle, set in the far-off past when Atlantis was (supposedly) dry land existing in the Atlantic Ocean between the North American and European continents.  The basic plot has a handsome young Mediteranian man shanghaied at sea by an Atlantean ship.  He is taken to the strange land and discovers amazing technologies (including solar-powered death rays -- told you it was sci-fi and fantasy, didn't I?) and a culture that walks the fine line between enlightenment and barbarism.  During his enslavement he makes the acquaintance of a wise scientist (Edward Platt [""Chief"" of CONTROL in the old Get Smart sitcom]) who sees the portents of some impending disaster.  You know what that disaster turns out to be, right?  Yup, a tremendous earthquake sinks Atlantis into the sea in a well-executed SFX sequence.  Who will survive the disaster?  You'll have to watch this fun bit of escapist drama to find out.",1254355200,19,1255,4.938095238095238
