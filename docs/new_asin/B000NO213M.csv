8389117,4,B000NO213M,"As a wildlife biologist and tracker, I also teach bear safety and bear spray classes for the organization I work for. I use this video as a review for my classes. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is outdated and I would like to see a newer version offered soon.
I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to live in harmony with bears, be safe in bear country, and who cares about being safe as well as protecting bears from people.",1412380800,,462,4.087912087912088
