3938043,1,B002JF6SQ4,I like Don Sullivan's information and approach to training my perfect dog.  (I purchased this 2-CD set after purchasing the collar and a 'single' CD produced by Don Sullivan.  I did not realize at the time that I was purchasing a single CD.)  He does an excellent job of conveying his reasons and the procedure to implement your instructions to your dog.,1424304000,,354,4.67741935483871

8371406,4,B002JF6SQ4,I love this tape.  I have shown dogs for a number of years.  This tape puts a new light on the subject of training.,1521072000,,115,3.75
8371407,5,B002JF6SQ4,Works great but the person doing the training has to use it as described or it will not be consistent. Consistent training is required until the dog understands it limits.,1516752000,,171,4.733333333333333
8371408,3,B002JF6SQ4,The der come with only 1 dish dvd,1515628800,,33,3.25
8371409,3,B002JF6SQ4,"Not as helpful as I was hoping it would be,it would help someone that really can train animals but it didn't help us much.",1496620800,,122,4.125
8371410,5,B002JF6SQ4,We have used this system on 3 dogs now. 2 of them were adults (3 years old or so) and one is still a puppy. They respond to the collar very quickly and the instructions are simple to follow.,1484697600,,190,3.8974358974358974
8371411,4,B002JF6SQ4,"The training collart is fantastic. Our dog becomes a much calmer & controllable pet.
He obeys commands & learns quickly with this program.",1482796800,,138,5.043478260869565
8371412,2,B002JF6SQ4,Kind of bummed that this uses force training not positive methods.  Some things such as boundary training were helpful but don't use corrections like that with my puppy so it was kind of a waste of money for me.,1467158400,,211,4.410256410256411
8371413,3,B002JF6SQ4,"Nothing has made my dog stop pulling, including this collar and it will last you not more than 1-3 months before fraying of cord material occurs. I kept it because it is the absolute easiest ""break away"" collar for me to handle if I'm in a hurry. Just to be clear, it's not a true ""break away"" (and not marketed as such) as a run away pet could still get caught on something without being able to get free on its own.",1458345600,,417,4.097560975609756
8371414,4,B002JF6SQ4,Easy Transaction... Item As Described... Fast Delivery... Recommend Highly,1448668800,,74,7.333333333333333
8371415,3,B002JF6SQ4,don't like Don so much but some of his lessons were helpful,1446163200,,59,4.0
