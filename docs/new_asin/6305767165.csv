1080460,5,6305767165,"This movie could be a video game it was so violent. Hollywood should remake this movie it would be a blockbuster hit for fans who love violent killing and carnage in the movies. Indeed this movie was ahead of its time in projecting action packed kung fu violence.
It has a great hero, great villians and lots of carnage. It is availabe on DVD.",1386115200,,343,4.375
1080461,5,6305767165,"Any movie that a guy shoves a boulder into someones mouth... that is a movie worth watching in my opinion. the first time I watched this movie I grew like five hairs on my chest, that's how cool and manly this movie is. Invincible Super Chan is a very slap stick and ridiculous movie filled with tons of humor and some crazy stunts. Beware if you want some serious kung-fu/samuri type of film because this thing is way way better, and some people are a little too stuck up to appreciate this fine gem of a movie.",1270771200,3,512,4.288659793814433

1080463,5,6305767165,"Invincible Super Chan is the hands down bloodiest martial arts film, period.  I urge you not to pay attention to these negative reviews.  Having watched it twice, I laugh as Chan flies up a huge cliff, my stomach churns as his arm is severed towards the end of the film, and I even get a little misty eyed...Its poor quality and bad dialog make it all the more wonderful.  It's plain groovy to see Chan leaping up a cliff or out of the water (with a backwards splash, wink wink).  It's equally wicked when he defeats 100 plus men and cuts a huge guy in half.  I'd say this movie has the hugest body count of any martial arts film.  Plus, I dig the comics on the back of the box.  This tops mine and should top your list of best kung fu movies!",1007164800,4,743,4.118055555555555
1080464,2,6305767165,"Now don't be fooled by the video box stating that it is the most violent and graphic martial arts movie to date.  well when it was made it probably was, but now?  no chance. It follows a vengful fighter who swares revenge  on his teachers killer.  once he kills him he is conciderd the greatest  figher of all, therefore he is challenged by others till his family is  attacked and he is forced to fight what seems to be his final fight.  The  death toll is sky high with Chan killing about 100 men in one battle.  But  besides the over all slaughter, the martial arts seemd slow, and there were  no fancy techniques or shapes, it just seemed like a bunch of angry drunk  guys kicking and punching.  It's worth watching just to say you saw it, but  i don't think it's classic material.  then again, it may be what your  lookin for, all you can do is watch:)",964051200,,856,4.25625

1080701,5,6305767165,"This movie was funny and had non-stop action. I laughed when I saw Chan fly up a mountain, dive into the water and come out completely dry, ripped the heart out of one guy and then shoved it in the mouth of another guy before killing him. Not to mention shoving a rock in a dude's mouth and pounding his face into the ground, see the evil General throw his flag into the river and surf across it. Chan takes on hundreds of men, kills them all and is not even tired. He really is the Invincible Super Chan!",1456099200,,505,4.111111111111111
7895711,2,6305767165,"A ""so bad it's WTF"" kung fu film. Chan is a warrior who seeks revenge on a wealthy lord for killing his master. He is also apparently Superman. He flies 300 feet up the side of cliffs, teleports on occasion, throws people into tree branches, shrugs off being stabbed like it was nothing, and kills probably 200 people in his quest for revenge in the film's first half hour. You'd think this would be awesome, but the kung fu in this film is pretty bad, and the editing is a horrendous mess. There's a lot of unintentional hilarity in the film, from the bizarre expressions of the enemies they cut to in between Chan's carnage, to Chan's love interest, who seeks to disarm him at every turn despite it not working anyways. It doesn't make up for the bad editing (it feels like whole scenes are missing) bizarre pacing (the movie switches gears 40 minutes in) and wooden dialogue. There are better movies on here for your kung fu needs.",1491609600,,934,4.5

7895713,3,6305767165,"This movie has terrible editing and terrible fight scenes, but the story was somewhat decent. I have to admit that the stuff they tried was pretty cool. Like the general using his flag to travel on water and the characters who all use unique/strange weapons. This movie felt like 3 or 4 different movies combined into one, which isn't a bad thing. but the editing is just so terrible. I'm no film critic and I honestly never notice things like poor editing, but it's so bad here. The close up shots are awkward and cuts are all over the place.

The fight scenes were a mess. It was slow and sloppy, probably how real fights would look only slower and silly looking (they were moving so slow at times that you could see hundreds of chances for someone to just stab the main character.

If you're a kung fu movie fan, you can skip this one. It's not worth it. If you've never seen a kung fu movie before, you might like it. It probably depends on taste really. The fight scenes can't be fixed, but with some decent editing, maybe? Assuming someone had the original film and could re-edit it properly, because it's a pretty good story like i said. It follows a unique plot line i've never really seen before.",1480032000,,1205,4.423423423423423
