It's a period piece, and a warts and all study of Canada, Hockey, and French-Canadian society in the 1940's. It doesn't glamorize Richard, but portrays him as an immensely talented, humble, and driven man with a hunger to do nothing more than score goals regardless of what life put in his way. For the Rocket it truly was all he was about. The scene where he is in the corner getting worked over by three Bruins, only to come away with the puck and score is a great summation of his life. Those three Boston Bruins may as well have been named 1.) Poverty, 2.) Racism, 3.) Adversity

If you aren't familiar with the history of Quebec, and French-English relations in Canada (and prior to this I only had a small knowledge of it) then this movie will be enlightening. If you aren't familiar with Maurice Richard, you will be awed by what he overcame and begin to understand what he means to French Canadians.",1199923200,2,1082,4.49238578680203
8155168,5,B000K9JEYY,"I have always been a Montreal fan despite living in New England and thought I knew Montreal hockey. This movie taught me alot about the great Montral teams of the past and the riot. I never really knew how the French players were mistreated, to a level that almost equals the mistreatment of Afro-American baseball players. Prejudice is apparently world-wide. A must see for any sports fan and in particular for hockey fans.",1198368000,2,424,4.821917808219178
8155169,5,B000K9JEYY,"Dupuis truly does score as Richard in this epic hockey film. The Rocket is the story of Maurice Richard's rise to fame in the NHL after having to overcome ordeal after ordeal as a second class French Canadien during the 1950's. The film depicts the gritty reality and discrimination he faces as a French Canadien struggling to play hockey during that era. Dupuis' acting is on point as is the rest of the cast's, which helps create the sense of loneliness that Richard must have been feeling at the time. Richard's relationship with his coach, Dick Irwin, is where Dupuis really shines. The film also includes some of the best hockey (and fighting) scenes ever in a film. You don't even notice it's in French the whole time because you are so wrapped up in the courageous tale of Maurice Richard. The Rocket parallels Miracle in its trueness to the sport of hockey, yet even non-hockey fans will enjoy the emotion and dedication that one man puts into his art, and moreover his ultimate dream. This is a must see, hockey fan or not.",1194566400,4,1032,4.614130434782608

It's meant to say that The Rocket does two things well -- captures the importance of hockey to a cold country, although I didn't think the actual game scenes were all that good, the ice too open, the moves too stylized and slow compared to the real thing.  Watching those guys playing without helmets and face shields was a pretty amazing throwback, though.  The Rocket works better as a French-Canadian take on their status as second class citizens in hockey, in Canada, and even in Quebec, and it works best in its portrayal of Rocket's relationship with Dick Irwin, the Canadiens driven English-speaking coach.  In their conflict, they are united by the drive to win, and a growing grudging respect.

This movie was obviously made with a clear point of view, with love and care (street scenes in Montreal of the 40's and 50's are often shot in a black and white that resembles old newspaper photos, a very nice effect), but it's a bit too stagey and reverent.",1175126400,2,1018,4.571428571428571
