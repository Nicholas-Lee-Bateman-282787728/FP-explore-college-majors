8654695,4,B00JZSKJ5Y,"It's interesting that this 82 minute documentary on the Brazilian ""culture"" known as ""Samba"" (it's more than a dance or musical style; it's a way of life) was produced by a Swiss company for broadcast in Switzerland. Who would have thought ?

The film - with English subtitles (which I found easy to read) - follows a particular dance school as it heads for the competition in Rio during Carnival in 2013. The first half or so shows the practicing done to drum beats (no other instruments are heard) and it can get a bit monotonous (it did for me) but later on other instruments as well as vocal performances are added. The costumes are as elaborate as any in New Orleans during Mardi Gras - the event, Carnival, is not unlike the annual New Orleans tradition.

I did learn a lot from the film though I did lose interest in spots. But, I'm sure that it will mean more for those who are interested in Brazilian culture.
There are no special features on the DVD and it comes packed with a 16-page booklet with a 2  page essay in English, German, French and Spanish.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
