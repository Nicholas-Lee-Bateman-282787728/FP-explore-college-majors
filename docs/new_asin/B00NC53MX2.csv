8677319,5,B00NC53MX2,"This is a nostalgic and light Operette in homage to Offenbach, with romantic, comic scenes and witty language that could be expected in a Parisian operetta. The plot and the music incorporate some aspects that might be familiar, like the character of Rodolphe (from Murgers Vie de Boheme) and music references to Manon and Mesdames de la Halle.  The production succeeds in bringing to life again Paris in the first half of 20th century.  The plot focuses on the romantic relationship between Ciboulette, a country girl, and the aristocrat Antonin, who is used to illustrate the shallow life of the aristocracy.

My kudos to the stage producers and designers.  The stage is relatively small, while the prompts and scenography are very effective and creative. They also work well for the video recording.  The music is tuneful and easy to follow; the voices, although not exceptional, fit the character of the operetta.  The video and sound recording are very good.  The booklet and the interviews in the bonus section are very helpful to better appreciate the operetta itself and its historic and musical context.  Despite the steep price of this Blu-Ray, it is worth it.  A pleasant surprise and experience.",1495843200,,1207,5.025125628140704
8677320,4,B00NC53MX2,"I only knew Reynaldo Hahn's melodic interpretations of poetry in song---so this witty, lively operetta is a happy discovery for me. The Opera Comique production is a gem---full of French flavor, period touches and delicious exaggeration. A joyful evening of music theater! Oh, great picture quality on this Blu-ray---and the production deserves it.",1425686400,,348,5.584905660377358

8677322,4,B00NC53MX2,"Reynaldo Hahn was well-known for his French music-hall melodies, and in many respects his 1923 operetta Ciboulette was a home-grown response to the American musical comedy, particularly those that portrayed the Belle poque period less authentically. Ciboulette, hardly any less idealistically, celebrates the innocent beauty of that age as well as its own. Quintessentially French, it's the kind of work that the Opra Comique excels in producing as the home of French lyric theatre.

The music for Ciboulette, conducted with a delicate lightness by Laurence Equilbey, is also authentically music-hall in style for a plot that is as frothy as they come. It concerns the romantic complications of Ciboulette, a young market-seller at Les Halles. Her aunt and uncle in Aubervilliers are pushing the young woman to marry, but the decision is not an easy one for Ciboulette who is engaged to no less than eight suitors. Playing for time, Ciboulette announces her engagement to a young man she has discovered hiding in her market cart, Antonin de Mourmelon, a millionaire who has just been jilted by his mistress, the glamorous and flirty Znobie.

The path to true love in a comic operetta is of course not as smooth as that, involving gypsy predictions, exotic disguises and romantic complications. Ciboulette is in some ways a throwback to the golden age of the opra-comique (with a few references to Favart, Offenbach, Meilhac and Halvy thrown into the libretto), but despite its knowing wit and cleverness, it's not really a pastiche, but clearly intended to be light, entertaining and filled with tunes for the enjoyment of the audience of its own time. There's a self-awareness then, but not self-importance. It's not looking to art or posterity, but to present the very best kind of sophisticated musical entertainment for its audience.

Ciboulette does that with a certain degree of charm, even if it's not quite as smart and funny as the best Offenbach. The music hall melodies and songs, despite Hahn's reputation, didn't strike me as being particularly memorable, while the comedy relies heavily on repetition. It seems to work to the principle that if you keep repeating phrases and words, they will eventually just become funny. On the other hand, much of the success of this type of work lies in the hands of the performers, and it must be played with the right amount of verve and comic exaggeration.

The set designs are gorgeous, with lighting and colouration that makes it look like a hand-tinted monochrome movie, giving the work a delightful sense of period charm and innocence, but it's the performances that really bring Ciboulette to life. Julie Fuchs doesn't have a big operatic voice, but one that is pure, sweet and lyrical with just a touch of the French music hall tradition. Julien Behr is indeed a perfect match as Antonin de Mourmelon, but there is fine singing also here from Jean-Franois Lapointe as Duparquet. It's the secondary comic acting turns that are just as critical here as the singing roles, and those are very capably handled.",1416096000,9,3064,5.025590551181103
