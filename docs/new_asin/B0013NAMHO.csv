8252411,4,B0013NAMHO,"This is a fun movie, the third of four Agatha Christie films from the producers of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. It features Angela Lansbury as Miss Marple, solving a perplexing murder in her tiny English village of St. Mary Mead. A local woman is poisoned, and the suspects are all in a visiting film company that's taken over the village to make a movie about Mary, Queen of Scots, including Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Kim Novak, and Tony Curtis. Along with the mystery, there are great scenes of the two movie actresses (Taylor and Novak) in a nonstop bitch-fest, and a lot of very funny jokes about Hollywood. Look fast and you'll see a very young, unknown Pierce Brosnan as Taylor's leading man in the movie (he doesn't have any lines). But Lansbury is the real treat here, creating a credible and likeable Jane Marple that bears favorable comparison to all the other stars who've played her (Margaret Rutherford, Helen Hayes, Joan Hickson, Geraldine McEwan, etc.). Recommended.",1207267200,4,987,4.880952380952381
