There are disclaimers at the beginning that tell you it is basically an ""unauthorized"" documentary without music.",1403222400,2,248,4.744186046511628
8325389,3,B000M4RG3S,"I was hoping to get a DVD of concert footage along with ""some"" biography. Unfortunately this was an ""un-authorized"" biography of Led Zeppelin, no music! I was disappointed but I will say the company I got it from shipped it very fast and it was in excellent condition so I won't complain too much. I will just add it to my collection!",1401062400,3,334,4.403225806451613
8325390,4,B000M4RG3S,"for collectors only as much of the Zep stuff is found on the official DVD.

Years after Zeppelin disbanded (and some years ago) we find Page/Plant press conferences filling up a major portion of the disc. CANDID with much humor and some decent tidbits here and there but if anything this material betrays Jim and Bob as being true fans of music and doubtful you will find such genuine enthusiasm coming from idiots like Bon Jovi.

As unauthorized as the rest but superior to the relentless barrage of ""Under Review"" garbage. Why do we care?? Same stories given mythical treatments by the lighting guy, the groupie or worse, actual music critics.
This was at least fun.",1194998400,6,668,4.75
8325391,2,B000M4RG3S,"I honestly do *not* like to give two star reviews, and I have nothing against the people who created this awful DVD - don't even know who they are, but I DO know LED ZEPPELIN DID NOT authorize or create this DVD.

Now, this is the very FIRST DVD that I FELL ASLEEP WATCHING. On the back cover [description] it hypes up a load of BS with the ""never seen before interviews"". One of the first interviews was the SAME interview with Robert Plant shown on the AWESOME DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Song-Remains-the-Same-Region-2/dp/B00004S5TK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Song Remains the Same [Region 2</a>] (That one is EXCELLENT.)

The best way I can describe this insult to production is that a bunch of interviews were thrown together - no narrating, no creative elements. One of the interviews I was sitting and watching AND WAITING for what felt like way too long a time at a press conference with my two ALL TIME FAVORITE musicians - Jimmy Page and Robert Plant - I beleive it was an interview about their DVD ""NO QUARTER"" (another awesome gem) and I did NOT GET TO SEE THE INTERVIEW - I literally FELL ASLEEP because they are showing footage of WAITING, Oh, and the Highlight was I got to see Jimmy pour a glass of water from a glass pitcher while he was sitting at a table.

I really, really wanted to love this DVD, but it is so BORING that it felt like viewing root canal - waiting and waiting and waiting. If this was FREE I would not get it. Just a hodgpoge of ALREADY SEEN interviews that were FAR more put together than this rubbish.

Be REALLY careful with all of these so called ""Led Zeppelin"" DVD's that are NOT made by the surviving members of the band. There IS ONE that is truly excellent:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Origin-of-the-Species/dp/B000FQWFRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Origin of the Species</a>&nbsp;(see my review.)

Instead of this waste of TIME that delivers nothing, definitely get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Song-Remains-the-Same-Region-2/dp/B00004S5TK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Song Remains the Same [Region 2</a>]and<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Led-Zeppelin/dp/B00008PX8P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Led Zeppelin</a>.

As for THIS DVD I'd rather go to the dentist than watch it again - I think that tells it all.

Sorry guys, nothing personal - a LOT more care could have created a FAR better DVD. Maybe next time.",1193011200,11,3183,6.748780487804878
