One of the greatest scenes in this movie is the highway  crash, which is entirely random and quite hilarious. Be sure to check out  the soundtrack. Robert Stack is great in this, too.",962150400,3,340,4.380952380952381

881935,1,6304437544,"I'll tell you what. You can agree with my opinion on this movie,or you can disagree. But like it or not,I will express my opinion. SOME people criticize Simon Birch for being too shallow. Well,Beavis&Butthead Do America is  about as shallow as you can get. There is no lesson to learn from this  movie. I'm not implying that every movie should teach its viewers a  lesson. But this movie is the biggest piece of trash I have ever  watched. Sure,I laughed the first time I saw it. It was so dumb,I couldn't  help myself. After watching this movie many times,I used to own it by the  way,I saw it as a piece of trash. This movie might be popular with other  viewers,but it will always be last place on my list. If anyone would like to  commend or condemn my review,you may do so by sending a message  to:

882502,5,6304437544,"I grew up with Beavis & Butthead in the 90's- and, in my experience, they're the best thing to spawn off of MTV.  While I do enjoy Mike Judge's other works- including Office Space, King of the Hill, and Idiocracy, these 2 immature teens hold a soft spot in my heart.  It's pure nostalgia and a fine example that not all cartoons are for kiddos.  There's rarely a moment of silence due to the duo's constant laughter.  I also have to applaud the voice acting!  Do a little research and you'll find that Mr. Judge himself provides the pipes for the majority of male characters in this movie & television series.

Seriously, the film is great and the plot is simple enough.  Beavis & Butthead are caught off guard after their pride and joy (the television) is stolen overnight.  On a quest to find a new one, they get involved with some sketchy individuals and eventually make a trek across the country in an attempt to score.",1442448000,,923,4.485029940119761

882624,5,6304437544,"Beavis and Butthead were pretty much the face of MTV in the 90s. They became a major staple in 90s American pop culture and were perhaps the most popular animated television show of the decade--even more than or equal to the Simpsons I'm willing to say. In 1996, Mike Judge saw much of a popular phenomenon the two degenerative teens were becoming, so he decided to make a full feature length film based off the two and their TV series.

Beavis and Butthead awake from an afternoon nap to discover that someone has broken into their house and stolen their television. Feeling lost without the security of their TV, they venture out on a quest to find it. After several failed attempts to get a TV, they visit a seedy motel that advertises a TV in every room. Upon their arrival, they meet the ragged Muddy Grimes who mistakes them for two hitmen he hired to kill his wife, Dallas. He informs the two that they must ""do"" Dallas. Beavis and Butthead interpret ""do"" as scoring with her, whereas Muddy actually meant kill.

Butthead convinces Beavis that if they score with Dallas they'll get paid and can buy a new TV. Muddy drives the two simple-minded teens to the airport with a flight to Las Vegas, letting them know that's where Dallas is and leaves them with a picture of her so they know what she looks like. Once they arrive in Vegas, they have no idea that their simple-minded and juvenile antics have caused them to become wanted criminals by the FBI, being labeled the two most dangerous people in America. Perhaps they should've gotten John Walsh to do a cameo appearance for this movie. Leading the investigation for the two is Agent Flemming who seems to have an unhealthy obsession for handing out cavity searches when he sees fit to anyone he considers a suspect. What happens next is a hilarious and enjoyable cross country trip as the sophomoric duo of Beavis and Butthead travel from Las Vegas to Washington DC in pursuit of their television and the beautiful Dallas to score with; all while unknowingly being pursued.

Overall: This is undoubtedly one of the best animated films and maybe one of the best films in general in history. Just to give you some idea of how loved and popular Beavis and Butthead were, Mike Judge was pitched 5 different movie offers within the first week of the first episode of the show. As far as I know, that's never been done with any other animated tv show. Not the Simpsons, not Family Guy, not South Park, not King of the Hill. In addition, its film release was the biggest December box office opening in history until the record was beaten by Scream 2 the following year in 1997. Whether you're an old school or new fan of Beavis and Butthead, you'd be crazy not to have this film in your collection. All the usual goofball antics and degenerative jokes and humor that were in the TV shows is transferred to the movie, making it just as enjoyable. Several well-known celebrities such as Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and David Letterman offer voiceover work for characters throughout the movie. The film also gets a pretty great soundtrack featuring bands like Ozzy Osbourne, AC DC, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. However, despite how awesome this movie is, in today's politically correct generation where people are easily offended, some might find this movie not of their standards. If you're someone who's easily offended or does not like juvenile humor, then don't bother spending money on this. But if you're someone who actually enjoys such content, then by all means, treat yourself to this classic and watch the hilarity unfold as America's stupidest but lovable duo get themselves in trouble (as usual) and nearly cause an emergency crisis, all for the sake of just getting their television back",1434067200,,3752,4.707762557077626

I don't have a problem with the crudely animated shorts, but I like how they really stepped up the quality in the movie. Still, I must admit that sometimes I am more in the mood to see the more crudely drawn cartoons.  They have a different feel to them. Funny, as always.

  After seeing almost every single episode of the tv show, I thought that it was funny how in this movie one of the army guys mentioned that a deadly biological weapon was tested on army recruits.  I find this funny, because throughout the tv show, different people, everyone from army recruiters to school administrators, are trying to get them to join the army.  Instead, they do their own thing and refuse to join.  I have a dark theory that if they joined the army in the television episodes, that they would have been the ones to be tested upon.  Instead, they didn't join the army, and were the ones to save everyone from this disease, and ultimately do more for the world than they would have ever done if they had actually succumbed and joined the army.",1416700800,,1141,4.385714285714286

882957,5,6304437544,"You know when Beavis and Butthead first came out in the early 90's I was apparently one of the few teenagers who didn't find the cartoon funny at all.  Crude, simple and idiotic typical teenage jokes just wasn't my idea of funny humor back then which is why I immediately preferred the Simpsons which in my opinion smears Beavis and Butthead entirely in terms of creative and diverse humor and character variety.  Even to this day with the decline of the Simpsons I still feel the same way.  When Beavis and Butthead Do America came out it was my dad's ex-girlfriend of all people who convinced me we should go see it in the theaters.  While everyone in the audience including her was laughing, I was only pretending to laugh as I thought it was really silly how Beavis would walk through the White House rooms and hallways blurting ""I am the great cornholio- I need tp for my bunghole"".  It just didn't seem very funny to me.

However now that it's been almost 20 years later (wow has time flown by or what?) I'm watching the movie again with a fresher mindset.  I'm no longer an upset teenager picky about judging humor.  So now I find the movie absolutely hilarious!  Though I really do believe the final 20% of the film is the least funniest part since it's all about a pill-crazed Beavis spazzing out and walking up to people blurting out the same lines with slight alterations isn't very entertaining.  I love the first half however which is completely different, especially when Butthead points out ""ain us"" in ""entertain us"" while in high school attempting to wheel the TV out of there before their teacher stops them.  Whenever Beavis and Butthead split up big words and detect dirty or offensive words is always REALLY funny to me, haha!

I suppose I did the complete opposite.  I'm supposed to find a movie like this as a 33-year old man disrespectful and childish now, but I've really loosened up over the years pertaining to just about everything life has to offer, not just comedy movies.  Anyway the story is that Beavis and Butthead want desperately to score any way they can after it's discovered someone broke into their home and took their TV, so they take unintentional road trips across the country with an old lady who plays a frequent role, and the FBI agent chasing down Beavis and Butthead voiced by the legendary spooky-voiced man himself Robert Stack from those Unsolved Mystery programs.  Tom Anderson comes along on the adventure too while taking a vacation with his wife.  Of course he ends up on the receiving end of Beavis and Butthead's wrongdoings so both Beavis and Butthead come out looking like gold while Anderson looks bad in comparison.  By the way the toolshed joke involving Beavis going at it was overused too.

Yeah the animation is rough, but truthfully it looks slightly more appealing than the way it's presented while watching the old MTV cartoons of the show.  The humor is a little funnier, the storytelling sharper and more creative, the soundtrack featuring the Red Hot Chili Peppers, AC/DC, Ozzy Osbourne and other popular acts of the time is fantastic.  You can't go wrong with these artists.  Anyway Beavis and Butthead find themselves travelling to Las Vegas where Beavis and Butthead become fascinated with a big-chested statue, hotels, New Mexico, the Hoover Dam (involving a hilarious flooding segment), Washington DC of course, and several areas outside such as the desert.  I don't remember seeing Beavis and Butthead riding motorcycles like we see on the box cover though.

Favorite moments?  Well how about when Beavis and Butthead get on the wrong bus and ride with the nuns?  ""Hey baby!"" says Butthead when he realizes he's on a bus with chicks.  The nuns can't fix these boys but they try... for a while!  And they sneak away running when Beavis and Butthead have their backs turned so they can finally have some peace of mind!  Or whenever Beavis and Butthead would find themselves being in the right place and the right time when someone would spot them on a Wanted poster, so they'd always be able to make a clean escape in some unintentional way or another.  ""Ignorance is bliss"" is basically the meaning here!  Or the scene where Beavis and Butthead walk across the desert and they see two vultures going at it before taking a hallucination-like drug trip as they pass out from heat exhaustion.  Just too many funny segments to really name the most memorable one.  If you're a fan of the TV show you'll be surprised the quality of the movie writing here is superior to the show.  A full-length 80 minute film is ideal for Beavis and Butthead lovers.  Highly recommended.",1409529600,,4641,4.724223602484472

883037,2,6304437544,"Yeah, I kinda knew going into this that it wasn't going to be great. Actually, I got a warning sign when I watched the show. But as the film lover I am, I was like 'Heck, you like watching movies you haven't seen so just give it a chance'. I did, and I got this. Now, I'm writing this review, as an outsider, the film was probably well received by fans of the series, which I am not, so I ended up going in fresh eyed and came out disliking the film. When you get down to it, film adaption's of television shows and books are usually not very well received by audiences and critics alike. And usually that is the truth but every once and awhile you get your 'The Simpsons Movie' and so and so, but then you get others like this film. Now onto my review of 'Beavis and Butthead: Do America'.

'Beavis and Butthead: Do America' follows two teenage best friends, Beavis and Butthead (Both voiced by Mike Judge) as they travel cross country to 'do' a woman, whom they were told to 'do' by a man named Muddy (Voiced by Bruce Willis). As they travel cross country, they're mischief adventures cause police agents to go after them, as well as Muddy himself as well as the woman herself.

After the first five minutes of the film, I knew these boys were complete idiots. I mean, I'm not even kidding. They are completely stupid. Their stupid was so stupid it rubbed off onto the film and made it stupid. The film is so stupid. None of the movie makes any coherent sense. Nothing happening makes any sense at all! Those boys walk through one situation and onto another and onto another like it's a ride. While I must admit, some of the stupidity is pretty funny; most of it is pretty dumb. If you were to watch this movie, I know your brain cells would begin to burn off. I know mine did, as I sat hopelessly watching this mess. It's random, and dumb, and nothing works.

I have to give points to the film, though. It is pretty entertaining.... If you're drunk. But, I guess even if you're not, you might find at least some part of this film entertaining. I will admit this 'Stupidity is funny'. Take the movie series 'Jackass' for example. Entertainment is watching something you wouldn't do yourself. Or, at least you wouldn't imagine it happening to yourself. That definition of entertainment may be debatable for some, but it is the clearest sentence for me. So, in other words, to sum this paragraph up, 'Beavis and Butthead' is pretty fun to watch, if you enjoy the taste of vinegar the film washes its mouth with the whole way through.

There's no enjoying the characters of the film though. To be exact, there aren't many actual characters in the film, maybe five main ones to choose from.... But really you don't like or relate to any of them. Well, that would be wrong, because you could relate to that guy, Tom Anderson, who sounds and looks just like that other animated character, (Also voiced by Mike Judge) from 'King of the Hill'. How could you relate to him, you may ask? His suffering throughout the film. His frustration. Beavis and Butthead themselves are stupid, mean, crude, rude, filthy, dirty, nasty gremlins. All they do is cause trouble. Trouble, and then more trouble, and then more trouble. Those boys are so immature it's beyond them. All that is on their immature sixteen year old boy minds is sex and violence. Oh, and there's more. There whole life is basically set in stone by sex jokes. That's all they talk about is sex and more sex, and sex. It gets ridicules. Those boys are just bad. They act as the devils creations on earth. Ugg, I hated them.

The animation is just as ugly as the lead characters, Beavis and Butthead. Let me describe it the best way I can. It's like chalk that has been scrap for decades against a chalkboard. It looks rough, nasty, and amateur. Ok, ok, I realize the film was made for a mere 12 million, most of which probably went into marketing and such, but I feel they could've done better. I mean look at other hand drawn movies and such. Like, for example Pinocchio and that, which was made on an even lower budget, but with crisp, and clean animation. This animation style could be purposely imposed but, I really don't know anyone who likes that kind of animation. It's not pleasing to the eyes at all.

The plot is like a single sentence. 'Two stupid boys, go on a stupid adventure across America, and do stupid things'. That's about it. The plot is nothing beyond the basic road trip formula; it never takes a side road, and simply takes the safest route. Nothing new is worked up, creating the script. No twists or turns, everything is just played straight. I'd like to infer that the film takes the usual formula from the show, which just doesn't translate well from a 20 minute episode to a full lengthed 80-90 minute movie. It doesn't translate at all actually.

All and All, 'Beavis and Butthead: Do America' features a few decent laughs, and is mildly amusing, but suffers from stupidity, poor animation, and unlikable characters'. D- 3/22/14

P.S: For fans of the show, this is a plus, but for anyone else, this film fails to live up to anything worth viewing, for a second time. It's a one and done deal (If you actually get through it the first time)",1404691200,,5220,4.481598317560462

883615,5,6304437544,"If comedy makes you cheerful, then this movie is the best damn antidepressant drug ever existed. Words cannot describe how hysterically funny this movie is, even after seeing it 25 times. From Motley Crue roadies to misinterpreting ""slots"" as ""sluts"", from Cornholio to a thousand hail Marys, this film has it all. What it never had was a decent DVD package. Well, ten years after the bare-bones release, BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA gets the proper treatment that it deserved.

Everybody who has seen the picture knows the story: our dim-witted heroes wake up to find their television set stolen. After searching in vain for their TV, they come across a criminal who accidentally assume that they are the punks sent by Earl to ""do his wife."" The criminal sends Beavis and Butt-Head to Las Vegas to take care of the wife, only for the wife to manipulate the duo and have them travel to Washington D.C., with a devastating virus at hand. The ATF, led by the late great Robert Stack, now have to find the duo and retrieve the virus before it produces an epidemic in the United States. Of course, despite these significant events, Beavis and Butt-Head are oblivious to everything that is happening around them.

Get the plot? No matter. The convoluted story is just an excuse for the pair to raise hell and for us to enjoy them causing mischief in America. Rather it is mistaking a confession booth for porter potties, creating the worst highway disaster in nation's history, nearly causing a plane to crash, sabotaging a dam or inexplicably tormenting their neighbor, who just so happens to be going to Washington D.C. in their trailer, this movie is pure, unadulterated fun from beginning to end. Despite complaints about the animation, the crude visuals perfectly compliment the movie; if it was a polish hand-drawn animation a la Disney, it wouldn't be as funny. Of course, there is a spectacular camera shot of Beavis and Butt-Head dancing to Red Hot Chili Peppers' ""Love Rollercoaster"" but other than that, the animation is merely an update on the show's visuals. And why fix something that ain't broken?

Now on to the DVD. It's not Criterion but then again what is? In this Special Collector's Edition, there are the rudimentary trailers and TV spots but then there is a making-of documentary that shows the production of the film, including voice actor segments, a feature on John Frizzell's music score and, the best bit, Mike Judge and Yvette Kaplan's audio commentary, which was missing from the original, bare-bones DVD version. Needless to say, Judge's commentary is very entertaining and worth your while when you have time to spare. The picture and audio quality is very good, probably the same as before.

Now common logic says that a movie like this is geared for fans only, right? You'd be surprised how wrong you are. My father, who is not into animation, saw this movie for the very first time at the Atrium Theaters in Staten Island in 1996 and was literally laughing his head off. This from a guy who never saw Beavis and Butt-Head before. There is a lot for everyone here and not just for the fans of the show. In fact, it's rare that a movie based on a TV show could offer something for both fans and non-fans.

What else can be said about BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA that has not been said before? You owe it to yourself to pick up the Special Collector's Edition version of the movie and enjoy the flick. This movie is a modern comedy classic and one of the most sheerly pleasurable experiences you will ever have. What better way to celebrate Beavis and Butt-Head's return to television than with this terrifically entertaining comedy masterpiece? You'll laugh til it hurts. Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh.",1290988800,2,3730,4.758887171561051

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Beavis and Butt-head, MTV's metal-head morons, finally conquer the big screen in this on-the-road, on-the-run comic adventure. The boys run into real trouble when--and this really sucks!--their all-important television set is stolen and they get mistaken for a pair of hit-men hired to ""do"" a man's sexy wife. Their misunderstood task takes them from Vegas to D.C., with plenty of hilarity but nary a music video in sight. Beavis' wired alter-ego Cornholio's rampage through the White House is a particularly twisted highlight.",1287705600,,636,5.287128712871287
883617,5,6304437544,"I love B&B; they go back to a more innocent time for what is now considered grown up cartoons. Now, I have to keep an eye on what my son is watching, with dubious names like BLEACH; there are a few of the animae things that he knows are not going to see the light of the tv screen as long as he's living at home. But Beavis and Butthead were just a couple of fourteen year old kids who liked metal bands, make suggestive phone calls,and tried to come up with a few dollars here and there by attempting to sell long-suffering neighbor Tom Anderson The Buttscratcher 2000. Everything you see now in FAMILY GUY and its' knock offs, as much as I love that show sometimes, goes back to B&B, IMO. There was hilarious digs at society, fame (in the original MTV videos) and religion. The series is a gem, and this, the first (and only) theatrical release. got raves from no less than Gene Siskel, of Siskel and Ebert fame. The boys go in search of their stolen tv, are mistaken for hit men, are mistaken for terrorists...and they get lost in the desert, act up on a plane, take various cross country buses (I fell down laughing at Beavis explaining just how kick ass the Bible is, while on a tour bus with a bunch of nuns) - the movie is jam packed from minute one with cartoon action, gags, political digs - all disguised as dumb entertainment. It's more, and while I am not sure under twelve years old should watch it - but then, we have so much worse on nightly tv, and it is important to note that there is no profane language, etc. in this film -, I see no reason why teens as young as thirteen can't watch it and figure out the humor beyond the innapropriate behavior. (If your thirteen year old copies Beavis' behavior on an airplane, well, you've got more problems than a cartoon are kicking up). Adults will laugh their $@#es off, and after sitting through the cloned Disney stuff over and over, different title, same plot, this is a refreshing change. Oh, and poor old Tom Anderson makes an appearance in the movie, too - I wonder if, in the rumored new movie, he'll have wised up and moved far away from these bad, bad boys?????",1285545600,,2131,4.33

883762,3,6304437544,"MTV scored big with Mike Judge's tale of two morons. Originally aired as a short on the animation showcase ""Liquid Television"", the TV series is best summed up as a show about two idiots that watch MTV made for, and popular among, idiots that watch MTV. So it was, and I was among them. Same with the feature length in which the dumb duo did America.

""Frog Baseball"" was the first Beavis and Butthead piece. You got to realize that we had never seen a cartoon like that before. Real cutting edge stuff. Two juvenile delinquents hang out, laugh at each other's b.s., and smash a frog with a baseball bat. Almost shocking and revolutinary. The animation itself seemed decadent. When you first saw it you had to wonder about who made this show. Turns out of coarse Mike Judge is not at all a sick weirdo (as far as I know) and is a talented comedy writter. After Beavis, Judge went on to create another great animated show called ""King of the Hill"" ya may have heard of which features the same style of animation, but not so much scatological humor. It's considered one of TV's greatest cartoon series ever. And Judge did ""Office Space"" which is now a bonified contemporary cult classic. And since I'm giving tribute to Mike Judge's career, if you've not seen ""Idiocracy"" you really should.

What I want to say here is that the show was actually not quite as dumb as most normal, intelligent people naturally thought it to be. I mean the show was dumb, but, well, people focus like most unhip people always do on *what* the show is about, but not *how* it is about what it is about. I'm not saying the Beavis and Butthead series is brilliant, just that it isn't as retarded as it's subject matter and title characters strongly suggest. Plus there is an extremely annoying American bias against animation. Even in 2008 animation is widely considered just kid's stuff. Unfortunately on the DVDs there are no music videos cause that is where some of the wit came into play. Beavis and Butthead watching terrible MTV videos contained some of the funniest and smartest comedy of the series. It is best understood by us poor souls that grew up with -and were warped enough by- the corporate garbage pop culture of MTV. It is easy now to forget how pompous MTV was back in the day. I haven't really seen MTV in years except for a brief glance while channel surfing. As dumb and developmentally retarded as the duo obviously was, they had a fairly good grasp of what ""sucks"" and what is ""cool"" as well as a partial grasp of how mass media manipulates and tries to play them which was displayed by their steady stream of wisecracks and laughter. Baby bommers looking at Beavis and Butthead as part of the ""dumbing down of America"" had nothing on their video commentaries. Sitting on that disgusting nacho crumb and roach infested couch they gave insights into the horrible, idiotic, immoral culture ..wait, hold up a sec, got to do another line.......Okay, I'm back-  that they themselves were born from. MTV gave birth to these two little mutants. MTV created the need for them after years of being taken too seriously and bringing youth culture mostly mediocre, uninteresting music and culture. Of coarse, a lot of what Beavis and Butthead said about music was wrong, but most viewers could tell when they were wrong and so the show *still* sort of managed to say something useful about how dumb MTV is. Adults didn't get that. Beavis and Butthead were laughing at themselves.

Whatever. A funny comment came from the wonderful weirdo director Tim Burton that I recall when I think of B&B (which isn't often). He was on one of those VH1 shows were they have a bunch of celebrities sitting there and show them individually commenting on other pop culture personalities, old TV series, media events, etc. On Beavis and Butthead he said there is like a part of each one of us that is like them. Or something like that. Like we all have an inner Beavis and Butthead. Maybe he means the Id. So there is a psychological explanation for the show's mass appeal too. (I'm not high.)

Anyway, as for as the movie goes, it kind of sucked. It sucked because the show was extreme for TV at first and with a film Judge could have taken it to the next level, but instead played it safe. In my opinion ""Beavis and Butthead Do America"" should have been rated ""R"", contained nudity, adult situations, lots of death and explosions, and an absurd amount of profanity. Then they should have released the ""UNrated"" version on DVD which is so hardcore it is banned in some communities because little redneck kids are setting their trailer parks on fire and offering animal sacrifices to Sterculius.",1218240000,3,4666,4.623642943305187
883763,5,6304437544,"""Beavis And Butt-Head Do America"" came out to a lot of fanfare in the mid-1990's, and I was one of many who went to the theater to see it, and someone in the row behind me summed it up pretty good: ""...I can't stand it, I'm laughing too hard!...""

There is a lot of extremely low-brow humor in this film, but it is actually a sophisticated screenplay, with a lot of nuances to it; it isn't just a bunch of sight-gags aimed at stupid people. The plot follows our heroes from their home in Highland, Texas to Washington, D.C. via many scenic and historic places, where they meet many eccentric characters and get into several scrapes, all the while remaining oblivious to how dire their situation really is. Their TV has been stolen, and they just want to get it back, or maybe get a new one. They unwittingly become pawns in a murder-for-hire plot, as well as an international bio-terrorism scheme. They unknowingly smuggle a device to the White House which, if detonated, or even damaged, will unleash a super-virus which will bring about a nightmarish outbreak of illness unlike anything many have ever seen. Their motivation? They believe they will ""score"" with an extremely sexy woman who will give them a lot of money, just to go to Washington. When she discovers what naieve kids they really are, she sews the doomsday device into Beavis' pants (he took them off, thinking he was going to take her to bed), and tells them to take a tour bus to Washington. To them, it is a fun trip, despite some inconveniences, but they only see it as a road trip. They just want their TV, and they want to ""score.""

This movie was my first taste of the work of Rob Zombie. I'm not really a fan of his music, I don't hate it, but I don't get into it either. While the story takes us to the desert, there is a peyote-induced hallucination sequence devised by Rob Zombie, accompanied with music from his band, White Zombie, with a selection called ""Rat Finks, Suicide Tanks, And Cannibal Girls."" This is an outstanding piece of film. I have this movie on tape and on DVD, but seeing this sequence on a big screen in the movie theater, was very memorable. This bit wasn't really part of the story, but worth the price of admission nonetheless.

Of course, as per the TV series, Beavis and Butt-Head cause bedlam everywhere they go. They don't mean any harm, they just don't have a clue. And coincidence keeps making them cross paths with poor old Tom Anderson, who just wanted to see the sights on his way to Washington, and visit the White House. On the surface, nobody deserves the hassle he goes through, poor guy, but he is SO clueless, he virtually asks for all his woes. So it's no surprise when he goes down with the villians as a conspirator.

This review is based on the original VHS release and the first issue of the DVD. In this format, there are no extras, apart from two short movie trailers. The tenth anniversary release may have a lot of extras, I don't know. But really, who actually NEEDS all that? Sure, it's nice to have all that, but why do you buy a movie on tape or disc?

883769,5,6304437544,"Before South Park came on the air and offended practically everybody with cripple fights to cooking parents in chili to saying the S word a record 162 times, there was Beavis and Butthead. Found on MTV, the pair were crude and just plain moronic who laughed at even the mention of dirty words bringing out the popular catchphrase ""uh-huh, you said "". After the show ended, the pair got their own movie and became a surprise hit so who would've guessed that it's actually still funny?

Beavis and Butthead are sleeping on their trademark couch which allows a pair of robbers to steal their prized TV. Not wanting to just allow it, they go hunting for it and end up meeting Muddy, a biker who will pay them to ""do"" his wife, which of course he means kill but they didn't get that part. So he flies them to Vegas to meet her only she sends them to Washington with something particularly interesting and quite dangerous. And of course the hilarity and antics ensue.

Now, the humor seems kind of tame. Buzzards having sex with each other or a topless sphinx probably doesn't have that kneeslapper kick to it like it used to. Not that I mind anyway since even if certain jokes don't work, the whole thing has a very loose and laid-back feeling about it where it doesn't even matter if you're not laughing, you're just glad they're up there. Some jokes, such as the preposition one, Beavis' alter-ego Cornholio are always funny, not to mention Robert Stack's ATF character's love for cavity searches.

Does it have some problems? A bit. The reliance on toilet humor can only go so far and you kind of wanted them to do more America rather than the limited ones we have here. We literally skip over certain states that could've got some good mileage. And while visually impressive, the Rob Zombie inspired freak-out in the desert just doesn't fit (and to be honest: anything involving Rob Zombie and filmmaking just doesn't work). But they're only minor concerns and of course this is a MTV movie - a Beavis and Butthead one nonetheless - so all that stuff gets thrown out the window.

The special features are pretty good but you kind of wish there was more. We have a commentary with Mike Judge and Yvette Kaplan with Mike slipping into character a couple times(not often enough but the mention of his dream involving the movie is hilarious). The featurette is slightly disappointing as while we do get some background and discussion, some of it is either redundant and back-patting or mentioned already in the commentary. But seeing some footage of the VA's, including Mike Judge doing Beavis, Butthead and Mr. Anderson are always awesome.

If you were into the show, this is of course a good place to start. If you weren't, give it a try since this is probably the best launch pad to get into the show.",1158537600,9,2799,4.612449799196787

If you ever enjoyed watching Beavis & Butthead on MTV and you never saw this movie, then you must live in a cave. Beavis & Butthead wind up traveling all across America as they try to hunt down who stole their most prized possession...their TV.

Muddy is too drunk to notice or care that Beavis & Butthead are a little young for the job, all the while they think ""doing"" Muddy's wife implies sex not murdering her. Muddy sends them to Vegas to off his wife, but when they get there, she finds out their plan and plays on their naiveity (or should I say stupidity) to get them to head across country on a bus to Washington, DC.

883874,4,6304437544,"I know a lot of you who have never seen Beavis and Butthead probably think very little of the show based on the low-brow nature of it (I was one of them), but if you give this movie a chance you'll see that it's actually as well written and at times as, dare I say, subtle as King of the Hill.

Beavis and Butthead have their TV stolen and when trying to get it back are mistaken for hit men by drunken drunk Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis, as I was rather shocked to find out once the credits rolled), who sends them on a mission to 'do his wife' Dallas. Misinterpreting this as any horny teenagers would, B+B head to Las Vegas to carry out the terrible act. But we discover (they don't, however) that Dallas and Muddy are part of international weapons conspiracy and our two teen-aged heroes are being set-up to take the blame.

So, as they take off across the country, causing absolute mayhem wherever they go, the ATF closely follow, giving full body cavity searches to everyone and anyone they meet at the order of head honcho Agent Flemming (the late Robert Stack), who comes out with some brilliant, deadpan one-liners. The set-pieces are wonderful and the mushroom-induced dream sequence by Rob Zombie looks amazing.

Mike Judge's animation style also brilliant. Avoiding bright, primary colors used in shows such as The Simpsons, Family Guy and Futurama, he uses mainly softer colors, pencil-effect scenery and water-color backgrounds. It's a sort of calming, easy-going animation style that he's totally made his own.

You should totally check-out this movie. Don't be put off by what you may have heard or may think of Beavis and Butthead. You'll be conning yourself out of loads of laughs if you do.

And look-out for Daria Morgendorfer in the 'Lesbian Seagull' scene.

883881,4,6304437544,"When I consider the film ""Beavis and Butthead Do America"", I think to myself, ""The guys who make the show probably wanted to have Beavis and Butthead do all of the stuff they do in this movie for a long, long time.""  Finally, Beavis and Butthead become classified as the most dangerous men in America, they meet their biological fathers, and in the opening credits of the film they parade around like cops from a bad 70's movie.

In addition to Beavis and Butthead finally satisfying the artistic desires of their creators, they remain true to their funny character, and deliver yet again.  They make fun of names of towns that sound dirty, cause major damage to other peoples' property (taking a toll on poor Mr. Anderson's possessions in the process) and laugh non-stop the whole time.  It's much like an episode of Beavis and Butthead you'd see on TV.

However there is a difference, and unfortunately it's mostly negative.  The film attempts to cater to a larger audience, including those unfamiliar with Beavis and Butthead, so the film is forced to constuct an intricate lengthy plot involving characters that are not included in the series.  Unfamiliar characters?  Ouch, the quality takes a hit.  Not to mention that the Beavis and Butthead series thrived on exeedingly simple plotlines so a full-length movie with a coherent plot is a bit out of territory they're familiar with.

The good thing about the movie is that it's like a work of art that brings to life certain scenarios that the makers of the series had no doubt dreamed of doing for a long time.  The bad thing about it is that it can't have a simplistic highly-stupid plot that remained a dominant feature throughout show after show of the series.  The plot of the film isn't quite as amusing as plots from episodes like ""Trouble Urinating"", ""Mr. Anderson's Balls"", ""Tainted Meat"", and other shows that focus solely on something as simple and hilarious as Beavis cutting his finger off in woodshop class.

My only real complaint upon first seeing this movie is that I thought it was too short.  I like Beavis and Butthead in almost anything.  I like the movie, and I think the series converts to film better than Star Trek: the Next Generation does, but I would prefer to watch a marathon of Beavis and Butthead episodes on TV if I happen to catch such a thing again.",1133049600,,2339,4.698529411764706

Although those shows are EXTREMELY hilarious, we must never forget the crazy antics of Beavis & Butt-Head. Because without Beavis & Butt-Head, shows like South Park would probably never exist. Matt Stone & Trey Parker (creators of South Park) themselves said that they like Beavis & Butt-Head. And there would CERTAINLY be no King of the Hill without Beavis & Butt-Head. If you have seen little to no Beavis & Butt-Head in your life, then you are truly deprived of really funny comedy. Mike Judge (creator of Beavis & Butt-Head and King of the Hill) is a very funny person with very good ideas, and this movie proves that beyond a shadow of a doubt.
For those of you who don't know, Beavis & Butt-Head are two very stupid yet very funny teenagers who are completely perverted and who are obsessed with heavy metal bands such as AC/DC and Metallica. Their crazy antics affect their life at home, at school, at stores, and basically everywhere. If you don't think they are funny from just this description, buy this movie and your attitude will change COMPLETELY!
Beavis & Butt-Head Do America is basically Beavis & Butt-Head on a roadtrip across America. After their T.V. is stolen, they are somehow thrown into an international conspiracy dealing with two criminal masterminds and a virus that is inside a computer-chip-like object. While they are being thrown into all this, they are prooclaimed the most dangerous men in America. And while the FBI is after them, they are blissfully unaware of what is going on. I don't want to give away what actually happens in the movie, but I will say that their journey takes them from their home town of Highland to Las Vegas, the Hoover Dam, a church, the Old Faithful geiser, the middle of a desert, and Washington D.C..
All in all, this movie is one of my favorite comedy movies of all time. This movie deserves a place right next to South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut in your personal VHS/DVD library. If you like comedy like South Park and The Simpsons, then you will definately like Beavis & Butt-Head and ultimately...Beavis & Butt-Head Do America.",1087689600,2,2232,4.7700258397932815

884098,5,6304437544,"One of the funniest 'underground' TV shows becomes one of the five funniest theatrical comedy films of the 1990's! BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA (1996) stars our favorite pair of perpetually horny and clueless Texas teens as they go searching all over the country for their stolen TV set---while trying to ""score,"" of course. That's all the plot there is! That's all the plot there needs to be; indeed, the whole point of this film is to sit back and follow the precocious, infectiously chuckling duo as they get from Point A to Point Z---with lots of stops along the way---and do what they do best.
Besides doing the voices of the titular characters---""hehe hehe""---Mike Judge also voices that old favorite, Tom Anderson, who would later metamorphose into Hank Hill. (As a testament to Judge's perpetual maintenance of television popularity, ""King of the Hill"" is currently in its seventh season and has by far outlasted the show that spawned it.) In his work, Mike Judge really shows that he is not merely a voice-over comedian; rather, he is a social commentator of all the different types of people you'd likely find in Middle America...and he is very funny.
Plot being irrelevant in this film, expect to see the kind of gags used on the show reappearing here (including, of course, The Amazing Cornholio!) and jammed into 80 minutes of quality crude comedy. Because this is a PG-13 movie, the crudeness is definitely turned up a notch from the TV show; however, nothing too outrageous happens (at least not onscreen). Robert Stack has a lot of fun spoofing his serious Elliot Ness image in the character of ATF Agent Flemming, who displays a much-too-eager predilection for cavity searches. (That's DEEP cavity searches!) In fact, this is his most inspired comedic performance since AIRPLANE! (1980). Cloris Leachman also has a lot of fun as a nice little old lady who keeps meeting Beavis & Butt-head at various times throughout their adventure and, miraculously enough, can see no wrong in them whatsoever. Other standout voice-overs are handled by Eric Bogosian (remember him from Oliver Stone's TALK RADIO?), Jacqueline Barba, Pamela Blair and even David Letterman!
Bottom line: If you loved the TV show, you'll love the movie; although if you loved the TV show, that most likely means that you already own this on DVD and have seen it at least 10 times. If you were too young to remember the show, but like stoner comedy in general, then you can safely bet you'll like this one. At the time it was released, BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA was the funniest feature-length animated film of all time. Even though it easily lost that title to the Trey Parker/Matt Stone sidesplitter SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT just a few years later, this movie still, like, totally rules in its own right. And it's got one killer soundtrack. Yeah, dude!

884164,5,6304437544,"New Year's Day, 1996, I made a rather foolish, STUPID mistake, and ""married"" a woman who - she said - had been ""chasing"" me since 1980 (refer to Eccleasiastes 7:26 in your Bible).  I mention this, because concurrently I discovered Beavis & Butthead, courtesy of my betrothed's 9 year old son.  Of course, I was immediately captivated, and, as I've mentioned in several other reviews, since I've pretty much eschewed ""popular music"" since about the time Elvis died, it made me very, VERY HAPPY to view videos with Beavis & Butthead and learn that I wasn't the ONLY one who didn't particularly care for ""Winger"" or ""Faith No More.""  You get the idea, rock and roll's been dead since 1977, and its ""remnant"" has all pretty generic since.  Anyway, by February, my stepson and I were quoting entire blocks of dialogue from B&B (which, of course, went over like the proverbial **** in the punchbowl with my ""wife""), and I was taking the ersatz ""remote"" off the B&B book, ""This Sucks, Change It!"" with me to work.  So you can imagine how happy it made me to learn that ""Beavis & Butthead Do America"" would be released a couple of weeks before Christmas that year.  I took my stepson and his cousin to see it, and it took the three of us until probably February of 1997 to quit acting out entire scenes or laughing about the movie.  Needless to say, I caught unmitigated hell from my stepson's relatives and from the folks with whom we attended Church.  But, truth is, except for that one line in the movie where Beavis takes the Lord's name in vain while he & Butthead are visiting the Hoover Dam, there was absolutely NOTHING worse in the movie than what my stepson heard EVERY DAY at school.  Enough babbling: ""B&B Do America"" was and is the funniest movie I've seen since 1987 (""Raising Arizona""), and the series' subsequent absence has removed ANY justification for MTV's existence.  OK, I've whined enough.  Buy this movie, sit back and view it when you're in a...""happily irresponsible"" (you know what I mean) mood, and I can guarantee you the most thorough, the most hysterical, tears-down-your-face laughter you've experienced since (this's gonna give my age away) your first Marx Brothers movie.  The scene in the desert when B&B meet their fathers is, probably, alone worth the price of the movie, but the running gag about hapless neighbor, Tom Anderson, or the scene where B&B are dancing to ""Love Rollar Coaster"" in Las Vegas, or - especially - where they run amuck in the White House, and Butthead tries to flirt with First Daughter, Chelsea, are hilarious, too.  ""B&B Do America,"" along with ""Raising Arizona"" and/or Chevy's Chase's ""Modern Problems"" will do the exact same thing for you that Prozac is supposed to do, and IT doesn't require a doctor's prescription.",1067126400,3,2774,4.742203742203742
884165,5,6304437544,"While searching the comedy section at the video store I noticed Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, literally crammed between two videos so it was barely recognizable.  While I had looked numerous times at the comedy section, it felt strange to me that I had never noticed the movie.  I looked at the cover and saw that it was obviously animated.  After seeing numerous terrible Disney movies with all their stupid and happy endings, I was almost ready to give up on Beavis and Butt-Head do America when I noticed it's PG-13 rating.  And a nice animated family film probably wouldn't be rated so high since cartoons are often directed at children.  I went home and popped the tape into my VCR.  After a very short 80 minutes, I had realized that this was one of the greatest comedies I had ever seen.
Beavis and Butt-Head Do America is not a family film.  It is a plain teen comedy about two dorks whoes thoughts about the world often get them into trouble.  Whether they're dealing with teachers, cops, or even FBI Agents, Beavis and Butt-Head manage to pull off one amazing popcorn flick.  Their crudeness and stupidity  is what pulls the entire movie together.  While at some times utterly disgusting and at others quite touching and funny, Beavis and Butt-Head Do America is a must-buy.
Our story begins with the two high-schoolers waking up to find that their most precious thing has been stolen: Their TV.  Their search for it leads them to Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis), who mistakes them for the two men he asked to do a job for him.  Misinterpreting his words, Beavis and Butt-Head (beautifully voiced by Mike Judge) head to Las Vegas, Nevada to complete the job.  However, the journey soon continues as a mix-up leads them to Washington D.C., where the movie's climax occurs.
Beavis and Butt-Head do America is a pure delight though not for the entire family.  The first time you view it is obviously the best one so I recommend buying it to feel more pride and joy when you realize how much of a phenomenon Mike Judge has built with this comedy and his other film Office Space.  Highly recommended, Beavis and Butt-Head do America is a pure romp, a delight, a treasure awaiting in any video store.  All you have to do is dig it out.",1050969600,2,2238,4.611111111111111

The fact that creater of the short-lived series of Beavis and Butthead and this great movie should waste his time with King of the Hill is only outstaggered by the fact that King of the Hill has lasted longer than B&B did, and it's still going! He should have stuck with B&B, because it was really something fantastic. There are so many other examples like this. Billy West, giving up being the voice of Ren and Stimpy and then Project GeeKeR to do what? By Fry on Futurama? Wasted talent. And yet Futurama has also endured so much longer. Not-so-good shows (or movies) are so often so much more successful than much better shows because popular opinion should not be trusted as a measure of quality. And then so many people are swayed by public opinion and what they expect, they just stop watching even if it is good. So, no matter what you believe to be true about Beavis and Butthead from what other people have said, forget all that!
Even if you have never heard of Beavis and Butthead outside of the context of some kids asphyxiating themselves to death on paint thinner, trying to imitate their cartoon heros, you should watch this movie. Even if you have something personal against them, you should watch this movie. They really give it all they've got in this movie, and even the sternest, most unforgiving of individuals should be able to appreciate it at its face value, as one of the greatest comedies of all time.

884254,4,6304437544,"How I do miss the boys.  At a time when MTV was actually cool and was playing music videos, (what are those again?), Beavis and Butt-head pretty much ruled the channel, providing us with hours after hours of pure entertainment.  Was it stupid entertainment?  Of course it was, that's why it was so amusing.  I actually think of the shows as a clever satire of how high school students are portrayed.  Now with their very own film, ""Beavis and Butt-Head Do America,"" the boys are causing more chaos and mischief than ever before.
After their beloved television set is stolen, Beavis and Butt-Head decide to watch another one, no matter where they find it.  Their stupidity leads them a drunken fool who mistakes the boys for paid killers he had hired to kill his wife.  And things quickly go out of control from one mix up to another.  The boys end up being a ""national security threat"" with every FBI agent after them.  And all they wanted was their TV back!  The results are hilarious and unpredictable.
This is a great movie for anyone who loves Beavis and Butt-Head.  Is it as good as the shows?  Not in my opinion, but it's pretty darn close.  The sick and stupid humor is all there and the storyline is very creative and well-done.  There are tons of celebrity voices that you just might recognize.
The DVD itself is average.  Nothing real new and exciting here.  There's two trailers, and that's about it.  The sound and picture quality is really good.  I just wished the DVD itself had more to offer.  This is a movie I wouldn't mind re-buying if they ever decide to make a special edition.
All in all, ""Beavis and Butt-Head Do America"" is outrageously funny and is a lot more clever than people give it credit for.

Many people wonder why other people like Beavis and Butthead. Setting aside their disgustingness, ""It's so stupid!"" they say. Well, I like it because it's stupid!
  The synopsis is right out of a B&B episode, albeit perhaps an incredibly long one. Awakening one day from a bizarre dream brought on by a movie on TV, our two favorite couch potatoes discover that, oh horror of horrors, their precious TV has been stolen! They embark on a quest to recover it. Thwarted first in their attempts to steal a TV from school by the untimely appearance of Mr. Van Dreson, then by Butthead's clumsiness and the untimely appearance of Principal McVicker, the two hightail it to Tom Anderson's place, where they discover that he has a camper. And, more importantly, the camper has a TV in it! Hell yeah! Posing as a couple repair men here to, ""Look at the TV,"" as Butthead puts it, they win their way inside. Not satisfied with just watching TV however, they decide to get something to drink from the fridge, which unfortunately isn't working. Upon discovering that the beer is warm due to the faulty fridge, Beavis spits it out...all over the TV, effectively breaking it. They then discover a hotel proclaiming free TV, and are then mistaken for hitmen. They are hired by Muddy Grimes (Bruce WIllis) to, ""do his wife,"" as he says, and thus begins the misadventure. Upon reaching Vegas, they are caught by the very woman they were sent after (played by Demi Moore, who turns out to be every bit as ruthless as her husband. She puts them on a bus bound for Washington D.C. telling them that she'll be there to meet them. Into the midst of this comes Agent Flemming (played by the late great RObert Stack), a no-nonsense ATF agent accompanied by his hapless sidekick Agent BOrk. The two are in pursuit of a new biological weapon stolen by the Grimeses, which unknown to the titular duo, has been secreted on one of their persons by Dallas. The two quickly find themselves involved in a bizarre series of misadventures involving everything from mistaking a confessional booth for a porta potty, impersonating a pair of priests and making a would-be confessor humiliate himself in various ways, to getting lost in a desert and in so doing meeting two men whose personalities bear striking resemblences to their own. And of course, Beavis' alter ego, the Great Cornholio, makes several appearances throughout the film, courtesy of a kindly but rather airheaded elderly lady who's a bit too free with her caffeine pills. All in all an excellent movie and one I'd definitely recommend if you're in the mood for a good laugh. Cornholio alone is usually enough to almost make me pee my pants.",1028505600,3,3013,4.608938547486034

I could probably recite every line in this movie word for word. Even though this movie isn't as low-brow and crude as the TV show, it does a pretty good job at doing what it does.

Robert Stack is absolutely wonderful as the hard-nosed FBI agent, who wants to cavity search everyone he comes across.  He plays his role, a very absurd but serious lawman, with perfecet straightness, like Leslie Nielsen in the airplane movies.
This is a movie that is consistently well-written throughout, with no real weak spots, or lapse in the comedy, and no lapse of self-awareness that Beavis and Butthead are truly stupid - intellectualy, culturaly, socially, and interpersonally, they are completely deficient.

884313,5,6304437544,"It has been more than four years since the release of this movie.  Sadly, Beavis and Butthead have faded considerably from the public consciousness.  Revisiting this film, I was struck by the element that made B&B so strangely endearing.  It's their essential innocence.  As utterly clueless as they were, when all is said and done they were harmless.  That said, the deeper, more disturbing, implication was that Beavis and Butthead are only SLIGHTLY exaggerated representations of today's youth.  The best episodes of the show are more slyly satirical than the movie.
This is an hour and twenty minutes of laughs, ranging from chuckles to all-out gut-busting belly laughs.  Whether or not you are familiar with the show (whose run ended in '97 I believe), if you have any taste for low-brow humor you are bound to enjoy this film.
Unfortunately, the DVD itself offers very little in the way of features.  The movie is widescreen and looks and sounds just fine.  Click on the 'Special Features' menu, and all you will find is a pair of teaser trailers.  Oh well, I've always maintained that a great movie doesn't need to rely on extras to make it worth buying.",978480000,5,1161,4.818181818181818
884314,5,6304437544,"If you don't laugh at this one, you probably won't laugh at anything ! America's favorite moronic duo hits the road in search of their stolen T.V.  and Western Civilization as we know it is never the same. Along the way,  the Boys nearly destroy Hoover Dam, hit on a few nuns, and experience a  wild hallucenigenic nightmare. (A bizarre sequence which must be seen to  believed!)
All of B&B's usual adversaries --Principal McVicker,  Mr. Van Driesen and of course, Tom Anderson -- make cameos. And yes, the  Boys do everything possible to destroy them as well !
Other highlights:  The Charlie's Angels/Starsky & Hutch title sequence is hysterical.  Check out Butthead as he wanders the White House halls hoping to score with  America's First Daughter, and who could ever forget the Great  Cornholio.
""Beavis and Butthead Do America"" rules!  It isn't  meant to be taken seriously -- it's meant to offend and to gross-out the  audience. Most of all, it's just meant to make people laugh. If you're  offended by B&B's disgusting brand of humor, avoid this one like Beavis  avoids working at Burger World. But,(""huh,huh...he said but..."")  if you liked Beavis & Butthead on MTV, you'll love this video. Beavis  & Butthead may never score with the chicks, but they sure scored big  with this flick !",967420800,15,1294,4.831050228310502
884315,5,6304437544,"When you haven't seen this movie, but have seen some of the episodes, you might think that the concept of a movie filled, no PACKED, with this amount  of stupidity would get old after a while. But the reality of it is that it  gets better and better. It's extremely funny from times to times, and it's  also very surprising. I'm probably going to buy this movie sooner or later,  and I suggest you do the same!",966556800,,410,4.285714285714286

The boys go on a roadtrip in which they're  more enthralled by automatic urinals than Old Faithful geyser.  The plot  is...well, who really cares about the plot anyway?  What you get is a lot  of good B&B humor in an extended ninety minute package.  I guess the  best thing you can say about it is that IT DOESN'T SUCK.",966384000,6,418,4.177215189873418
