8007759,5,B00018D512,"Considering that these recordings are more than 50 years old, they are a real delight, one could well wish for  much more of this, here we have really delightful ballet. Galina Ulanova, Maya Pliserskaya are a delight  to watch, especially I found The Fountains of Bakhehisarai, with the 43 year old Ulanova and the 28 year old Plisetskaya a real delight, it also reminds one of just how the Soviet Union embraced many nationalities, as did also the earlier Russia, this ballet is one not to miss, also The flames of Paris, provide an interesting view  into the French Revolution, again an excellent ballet piece, this DVD IS THOROUGHLY RECOMMENDABLE",1241222400,2,649,4.881818181818182

The three selections on this DVD give us a glimpse of the magnificent talent that was hidden behind the Iron Curtain in the early 1950's.  Fortunately, the film maker Gebbert Rappaport thought to preserve some of the work of these phenomenal artists.

These are excerpts from the Russian repertoire.  The first, Swan Lake, features the supremely gifted Galina Ulanova, whose grace, delicacy and beauty of form awarded her the title Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the Bolshoi.  There's a bit of predictably silly Soviet animation tacked into Swan Lake, but it's irrelevant.  Ulanova must have had the most gorgeous feet in the world.  It's a pity there isn't a complete Swan Lake with her.

The second feature, The Fountains of Bakhshiserai, based on a Pushkin poem, is the only time Ulanova and Plisetskaya were filmed dancing together.  This segment has some of the marvelous legendary Russian male power dancing that had its roots in the folk arts.  Plisetskaya, who was given the title Prima Ballerina Assoluta upon Ulanova's retirement, bares her flawless midriff in an erotic dance that is so hot my television started steaming.  One of factors that contributes to the splendor of the Russian dance tradition is the quality of the acting.  All the participants in Fountains are fabulous actors as well as very great dancers.  The scene between Ulanova and Plisetskaya is perfection.

The last segment, The Flames of Paris, is a Soviet homage to the French Revolution.  It is one of the only videos I can find with the tremendous Georgian dancer Vakhtang Chabukiani.  What a pity he is not well known in the West.  His speed and strength are miraculous.  The speed with which he spins around the stage seems to defy the laws of physics.  It was as if the editor fast-forwarded the film, but he didn't - Chabukiani had superhuman velocity.  There is also a wonderful dancer I had never heard of - Musa Gottlieb, a beautiful, graceful artist who knocked of 32 fouettes like it was nothing at all.

This DVD, along with Ulanova's Romeo and Juliet, Plisetskaya Dances and Plisetskaya's Swan Lake are among the crown jewels in my collection of dance videos.  Most highly recommended if you are interested in historic dance, Russian ballet, or just want to see some of the greatest dancers ever captured on film.",1147651200,28,2348,4.876262626262626
