8423491,5,B004CRPKM0,"Everyone knows about the 6 million Jews murdered by the Germans during WWII. Who has ever heard of the 3 million Polish gentiles who met the same fate, including a large fraction of Poland's intelligentsia (teachers, professors, priests, etc.)? Is the genocide of Poles part of the Holocaust, a holocaust but not the Holocaust, or some other item in Newspeak?

It is not rare for Polish-Americans to be ignorant of their heritage, and to repeat popular misconceptions about it. Certainly Mishael Porembski, a Polish-American journalist and daughter of a Polish victim, was in this state. Her father, Jan Porembski, except towards the end of his life, did not talk about his experiences. Mishael grew up under the standard Judeocentric curriculum, and had been led to believe that only Jews suffered under the Nazis. In fact, when she first learned that her father had been an inmate in the Bergen Belsen concentration camp, she at first thought that her father had been there because he had been mistaken for a Jew!

Gradually, the truth unraveled. Father began to talk about his experiences. In time, father and daughter visited Poland to see a few of the sites of Polish sufferings. The dominant Judeocentric theme of WWII memory not only had caused Poland's Holocaust to be forgotten, but also for Poland's experiences to be framed primarily in terms of the Jewish experiences. For instance, Poles are accused of collaborating with the Nazis in the extermination of the Jews. One of the elderly ladies interviewed pointed out that there were only singular instances of Poles engaged in this kind of conduct, and that good and bad people can be found in every nationality. Also, Poles should not be grovelling before other nations. More power to her!

The Porembskis visited places where the Germans had shot the Poles en masse. The viewer was informed of such things as the extermination of Poland's intelligentsia, the mass deportations of Poles for forced labor, and Hitler's eventual plan to replace Poles with Germans. The account of the Warsaw Uprising, while informative, unfortunately repeats the myth that the systematic destruction of Warsaw by the Germans, after the Uprising, had been done in order to deny living quarters to the advancing Red Army. In actuality, it was cultural genocide, pure and simple. Certainly there was no military reason for the blowing up of Warsaw's historic buildings and the burning of Warsaw's main libraries and archives, causing the loss of hundreds of thousands of priceless, irreplaceable items.

Mishael visits Auschwitz. The viewer is then informed of the fact that 75,000 Poles were incarcerated there (other figures are much higher), and that Auschwitz was one of the places where the Polish intelligentsia was gradually being destroyed by the Germans. Not mentioned is the fact that, as Europe's Jews were being finished off, the Germans planned to greatly expand the Auschwitz facilities in order to destroy many more Poles.

There is an interview with Michael Schudrich, Poland's Chief Rabbi. Schudrich makes some fallacious contentions. He basically excuses the Jewish hostility towards Poles by pointing out that, whereas the Nazis are gone, the Poles are still around to serve as a target. Such reasoning will not do. (If a dog bit me, and ran away, I would not thereby be excused in expressing my anger and pain by hitting the person located nearest to me.)

More significantly, Schudrich points out that each nation must make its sufferings known to others, and that, if its suffering are not known, it is that nation's fault. Certainly Poles should do more to promote their history among non-Poles, but it is ridiculous to suggest that the dominant Judeocentric approach to WWII owes to the Jews making the Holocaust known, and Poles not correspondingly doing the same.

In actuality, there are many works out on Polish WWII suffering (e. g., see the Peczkis Listmania: FORGOTTEN HOLOCAUST) but nearly all of them languish in obscurity. The present work, BURNING QUESTIONS, is a prime example. Though it is an award-winning documentary, and has been out for over ten years, it has but three Amazon reviews, and all three are by Poles or Polish-descent reviewers who specialize in Polish matters!

Why, then, has the WWII genocide of Poles disappeared down an Orwellian memory hole? The real reason, avoided by Schudrich, closely relates to influence and power. Poles, unlike Jews, are in no position to make their WWII experiences widely known, much less a significant item in the west's collective historical memory.

8423492,5,B004CRPKM0,"""Burning Questions: The Story of Catholic Poles in the Holocaust,"" a multiple-award-winning documentary, offers all the rewards of a home movie: it is stunningly intimate and heartfelt. The title and subtitle are unintentionally misleading. The documentary could better be titled ""An American Daughter and a Polish Father Explore His Family's Suffering During WWII.""

""Burning Questions"" tells a simple, easy-to-follow story: the relationship between a very beautiful, young, American girl, Mishael Porembski, and her mysterious, very handsome, foreign-born father, TV cameraman Jan Porembski. As Mishael puts it: ""My father's eyes hid a world I'd never fully seen ... Even as a child, I could sense that my father wasn't altogether happy. There was a somberness that would wash over him. This quiet sadness would create a yearning in me ... One area of my father's life was off limits - his homeland, Poland ... My father was interned in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. I've always wondered. Was my [Polish, Catholic] father a survivor of the Holocaust?"" One of Mishael's aunts was in Ravensbruck; the other was in Auschwitz.

The film follows Mishael's earnest attempt to understand both her father's hidden pain and American media's lies about Poland. The viewer gets a sense of what confronts Mishael five minutes into the movie. She is attempting to film her father. He glares at her. His face is utterly unforgiving and remote. This is a man who has seen the worst. One can only applaud Mishael's courage.

Viewers who are themselves of Polish descent, and whose family members remember WWII, will recognize their own loved ones in this film. I recognize the stoic, apparently emotionless faces and tightly compressed lips that greeted my attempts to understand that cataclysm. I recognize the casual way with which a former Auschwitz prisoner rolls up her arm and displays her tattooed number, as if it were of no import. On an undistinguished Warsaw side street, what might appear to be nothing but a brick wall is marked by a small cross. Jan reminisces about walking past this wall as a small boy, and seeing German Nazis executing Poles against it. Some Poles sang the National Anthem as they died. I recognized the previously tough, granite-like facial features melting into tears as victims, decades later, suddenly hit upon a new memory of their own victimization. I could only nod when Aunt Stefania forces Mishael to eat more than she wants, and when Mishael reports that her aunt walks in on her while she's in the bathroom. Privacy? What's that?

While watching close-ups of Aunt Maria's casual recounting of her days as a prisoner in Auschwitz, and her father's initial lack of on-camera emotion, I was reminded how more celebrated filmmakers, Claude Lanzmann in ""Shoah"" and Marian Marzynski in ""Shtetl,"" used Poles' stoicism to indict them as without feeling for Nazi victims. In fact, Poles were victims of Nazis, too, and Polish stoicism is a coping mechanism, not a badge of Polish indifference.

Mishael's grandfather, Henryk Porebski, looks like a delightful, carefree man in the one photo we see of him. This handsome young dandy is wearing a straw hat and carrying a cane. He is imitating the American film comedian, Charlie Chaplin. Nazis took Henryk, and he was never heard from again.

Jan, Henryk's son, now an old man himself, stares at the camera coldly. ""Someone will ask, 'Tell me about your father,'"" Jan says. His face is not cold because he does not care. His face is cold because he has lived with this pain all his life, with no comfort, not even knowledge of the location of his father's remains. Later, Jan is shown reading the Polish national epic poem, ""Pan Tadeusz."" Jan reads but a few lines before he is choked by tears. ""I thought I was over certain things but I guess I'm not,"" he confesses.

Mishael visits with Michael Schudrich, Chief Rabbi of Poland. Schudrich is compassionate and questioning. How do you explain this suffering, this pain, he asks? It is natural to want to lash out, he says. This is a great tragedy, he says, ""because the anger is being misplaced."" Hope can be found, Schudrich says, in ""feeling someone else's suffering."" Schudrich also says, ""If people don't know about your suffering, it's your obligation to talk about it. It's nobody else's obligation."" Poles, Schudrich alleges, have not made their suffering known to the world. Schudrich is right. Polish Americans are especially at fault in this regard.

Szymon Szurmiej, Vice President of the World Federation of Polish Jews, points out that Poland was the only country where Nazis mandated the death penalty, for the entire family, for the crime of aiding Jews. In spite of this, he points out, several thousand Poles, more than any other nationality, are honored at Yad Vashem for saving Jews.

""Burning Questions"" is not a systematic, theoretically-based presentation of Polish suffering during WWII, and it is not a systematic refutation of the charge, frequently encountered in American media, that Poles are the equivalent of, or even worse than, German Nazis. Because of the sometimes less-than-Hollywood production values, and the lack of systematic, theoretical scaffolding, I might award this documentary four out of five stars. I award it five stars, though, for this reason - no one else has done what Mishael Porembski has with this film. The Polish story is untold in America. Yes, there are writers, and I am one of them, but we have not successfully brought our work before significant enough audiences. We Polish-Americans are unknown, as Porembski demonstrates, even to our own selves. She deserves the extra star not for technical excellence or deep background, but for having the courage, and determination, to tell a story that has, so far, been silenced and ignored - including by those who have lived it, and their American children and grandchildren.

8423493,5,B004CRPKM0,"This award-winning documentary does an excellent job of presenting a part of the history of World War II that is seldom mentioned.  Focusing on the story of one man, the documentarian's father, this film explores the losses that Poland suffered under the Nazis, the three million Polish Jews who died and the less noted three million Polish Christians who perished.

My own grandmother was murdered by the Nazis, and my parents were taken to concentration camps in Nazi Germany where they were brutalized in a way that left them scarred emotionally and physically.  Watching this film gave me insight into what my parents and Poland suffered during the war.  I was especially moved by the scenes of reunion between the filmmakers' father and the relatives he left behind in Poland.

I don't think anyone, Jew or Gentile, can watch this film without feeling the suffering of that WWII generation of Poles, and the joy of that reunion.
