3477470,4,B001B093WO,"Great movie, got a few laughs, and something nicely different.  I got it for my daughter who loves cats and she really liked it.  The ""plot"" gets a little confused in the middle, but really this is more about watching cats playing than any great work of drama.  I'm sure we'll watch it again as it is a nice change of pace from cartoons and ""air bud"" movies.",1231804800,,358,4.235294117647059
3477471,5,B001B093WO,"Ok first up, I confess I did not rent this movie.  Some idiot rented it, popped it in and made me watch it.  But please don't give up on it.  This is good stuff.  Why?  Believe me, I will tell you why. I have to warn you though.

This is not your average animal feel good movie.  This is way below average.  If you hate lassie tv shows, or other animal movies about a dolphin helping old ladies cross the road, or a saint bernard coaching a 14 year old in algebra, you will understand what I am about to say.

The movie starts off as if it was some raw tv footage that the characters in the movie are watching.  Then you have an ""oh no"" moment because that IS the movie.  It's shot with a regular hand held video camera with real cats.  The premise of the movie is simple.  Cat owner goes on vacation, cat escapes, wanders the neighborhood and eventually returns home in time when the owner comes home.

Of course, like any animal movie, the owner doesn't realise the cat has been out.  Yada yada ok you will already know this within the first few microseconds of the movie.  See this movie doesnt even make you work.  It's the ultimate in laziness for the viewer. Be prepared though, to fidget a lot. I mean A LOT.

At one point in the movie, I thought this was a church sponsored movie but at the end of the credits I realized it was written by Susan Emery who probably is an elderly woman and who probably also writes sweet children stories about fairies bringing candy to kids who smile.  There is an overflowing amount of cat dialogue that is mainly generated to fit footage of cats looking around and fidgeting.

It is staggering how Susan is blissfully unaware of how many times this has been featured throughout the movie.  Perhaps it is to emphasize that a cat's life consists mainly of repetition.  It's pretty amusing how she decided to use many different voices to resurrect the inane cat conversations between the many cats, dogs, birds, frogs, and a tortoise that feature around the neighborhood.

There is a tough talking NY cab driver cat; she must have thought it would be cool to include it. Ok I started fiddling with my guitar, then my eyes started to water and I arched my neck back into a comfortable spot to rest, while the insane dribble kept going on.  As I was about to enter REM sleep, I heard this new voice from the movie that said ""I'm not a hamster"" in a scottish accent.  I completely lost it.  I had tears streaming down my face and I was clutching my stomach trying to breathe from screaming/laughing hysterically.

Nevermind that I missed whatever was going on in the movie while I was suffocating.  When I calmed down sufficiently, there was a tortoise impersonating Robin Williams impersonating a tortoise.  And there were frogs with french accents saying completely boring things like ""ok I am going into zee water"".  Needless to say I burst out laughing again.  It was so horrible and absurd. I was still laughing as I wrote this review.  Good grief, who would've thought this movie could be such a hysterical comedy.

There was a surprise line near the end of the movie that completely floored me.  I wasn't going to give it away but it's a very cliche line that has been used over and over in animated animal movies - ""Who let the dogs out"".  I laughed all night because the crummy delivery was just so spot on.

Conclusion: The person who actually liked the warm touchy feely vibe of the movie ended up hating the movie partly because I found it so insanely hilarious.  I kept going back and forth from trying so hard not to giggle and just laughing my ****ing ass off.  I bought a copy of it so my friends would hate me when I put this movie in again when they would least expect it (believe it or not, this movie is actually copyrighted, even the d**n credits became funny).",1229472000,,3818,4.416905444126074
3477472,4,B001B093WO,"I personally didn't enjoy the movie that much.  I will say this though - my son and my niece(4 and 6 years) really enjoyed it.  They are both cat lovers, having grown up in a household where the only pets are cats.
We didn't buy the movie, but we may, if the kids ask for it a lot.  I just didn't like it enough to buy it for my own enjoyment.",1226534400,,343,3.8028169014084505
3477473,4,B001B093WO,We liked this movie a lot but I can see how not everyone would. Watching the director/writer's commentary about how it was made was facinating. The cats were not trained!,1222560000,4,170,4.7
3477474,4,B001B093WO,and I was enchanted by the adventures of Marcello.  The photography was amazing... obviously the filmmaker understands how to direct the feline stars. I've never seen that before with live cats.  Definitely a stocking stuffer!,1221955200,8,226,5.428571428571429
3477475,4,B001B093WO,"This movie is for the cat lover in us all!  Real cats, in an exciting
adventure story.  Charming and funny, exciting and heart-warming.
Anyone who has ever loved a cat beyond reason, will want to see this film!",1221955200,7,210,4.5
3477476,1,B001B093WO,Watched about 30 min of this movie before my 11 year old walked out of the room and my 7 year old asked me to turn it off because it was stupid. The video quality is equivalent to that of youtube. The story is not creative. I would not recommend this movie even to a person I disliked..,1221523200,2,286,3.9482758620689653
3477477,5,B001B093WO,"WOW! ALL CATS!
I was able to get my paws on a copy to preview. (and i gave it a good cat-scan).This movie delighted me and my cats and my sister and her kids and her cats - even the ally cats were peeping through my window!  Ok! Ok! I'll say it...it's purrrfect! It's also an amazing movie to watch if you are into film-making, because at first you wonder how they did it...Then you keep waiting to see if a ""stand-in"" cat replaces the main cat actor (no!)...Then you get caught up in the drama, because it has a really sweet story about growing up and finding your way back home.  There are also a lot of action and funny scenes...like a classic animated film. In fact, it is really like a live action cartoon!  And, I LOVE that they didn't use CGI to make the mouths move.  Jeremy Piven is the voice of the street-smart cat ""Blacky."" He is funny and clever!! Michelle Rodriguez is the girl cat and she is (need I say it?)...Tender Vitals! Jeremy Sisto is the voice of the bushy tailed squirrel (not your average rodent!) Real Cats! Really ACTING! You feel it, and that is why it works so well!  Just watch there faces, they were totally ""there"" for the shooting of the scenes...very special...I love this film.",1220227200,,1212,4.368888888888889
8280762,1,B001B093WO,"What a major disappointment. Could barely make it through even the first 10 minutes of it. And I fast-forwarded stopping for a minute here and there the rest of the way through. It says it was released in 2008 but the owner of the main character cat is wearing mom jeans and a style of sneakers they used to wear in the early '90s, late '80s and the car she drives is also old school, so I'm wondering if this is a home video from that era that was turned around into a so-called movie two decades later. The plot is empty and not interesting at all and the voice overs just sound ridiculous and unprofessional. I absolutely love cats and enjoy just about everything marketed to ""crazy cat ladies,"" but this movie was God awful. That in itself should speak volumes about how bad this movie is if even I of all people didn't like it. A total waste of time and money. Boring and poorly made. I doubt even kids would like it. I give it zero stars if I could. Bummer, because I was so excited when I got it and was looking forward to seeing it. Colossal disappointment.",1463097600,,1065,4.2772277227722775
8280763,2,B001B093WO,Sadly sitting idly on my shelf gathering dust.,1411862400,,46,4.875
8280764,5,B001B093WO,"My kid and I rented this a few years ago. It was soo bad its been a ongoing joke. So he gets a copy for Christmas now...sucker!
Came on time and was in great shape ....damn it lol",1387497600,,179,3.736842105263158
8280765,5,B001B093WO,"I liked Marcello! This is awesome movie for cat lovers everywhere! Be warned it has real actor voices and is actually shot with what looks like a personal camcorder, once you are sucked in to Marcello's adventure you won't be able to turn it off! Kudos to the studio for taking a risk! I would recommend this to everyone!",1357862400,,321,4.4576271186440675
8280766,5,B001B093WO,"Marchello (Troy Garrity) is a pampered black-and-white medium-hair cat, an indoor-only feline who, when his human ""mom"" goes off for a weekend, manages to push a window open and get out.  His main goal is to visit Jujube (Michelle Rodriguez), the beautiful long-hair across the street, but he soon discovers that the Great Outdoors offers more dangers than dogs, cars, and the Big Blue Bus: a rollerblading catnapper scoops him up and carries him off for ransom!  Marchello contrives to escape, but now he's in territory utterly strange to him.  How will he get home?  His situation is complicated by two other cats he meets: Pinky (Shannon Conlin), his own almost-twin, who has stuck loyally to her ""home"" for the last seven days even though her ""mom"" has disappeared and the house is being torn down around her, and Blackie (Jeremy Piven), the tough-talking short-hair who compassionately helps strays find humans to love them.  Meanwhile Jujube enlists the local birds and squirrels to find Marchello and help guide him back to his own neighborhood.  This movie was made entirely with cats going about their natural routines (no trick-training) and is a sweet and touching--and often suspenseful--tale of the woes of strays.  All cat-lovers, young and old, should enjoy it.",1299801600,,1276,5.076555023923445
8280767,3,B001B093WO,"Got this for my wife.  It's an amusing movie, but fairly cheaply made considering there are a few actual star voices.  Fun for kids, amusing for adults who like cats.",1278633600,,166,4.5
8280768,1,B001B093WO,"I got this movie for my grand-daughter, she's 8.  We watched the 1hr 2min movie together.  I can say that we were both very disappointed. At several points during the movie my grand-daughter said...""Paw Paw, is this a real movie?? It looks like somebody make it with a video camera""  She was right.  Story's not that great either. I could not recommend this movie to anyone.  How somebody gave it a 5, I don't know. Maybe they were related to the film-maker(term used loosely).",1252281600,3,477,4.630952380952381
8280769,4,B001B093WO,"I work as a cat adoption counselor and I really was impressed by this film. They must have shot thousands of hours of film (or digits or whatever you call it now) and composed it into a storyline.

I make every one of my homeless cats watch the segment on how to get adopted. It really helps them charm their way off death row.",1250121600,2,327,4.109375
8280770,1,B001B093WO,"I could have paid hobo off the streets to shoot a better film than this! I think this movie was shot with one of those VHS camcorders and put into a dvd/vhs combo and burned on a dvd, then voice edited, then burned again and shipped out for release. Its sad really. I may go out this afternoon and record snails with my cell phone, add voices, and make a movie out of it. I'm quite sure it would be more entertaining and would not induce the headache commonly associated while watching Cats: The Movie, not to mention a huge upgrade in video quality. Please, Stay away from this sorry excuse of a movie!",1244332800,2,603,4.298245614035087
8280771,3,B001B093WO,"I was not sure what to expect with this movie, but I was intrigued by the use of ""real"" cats. This is not a flashy Hollywood movie; it appears more like a home movie with trained animals and voice-overs, but the story is cute and the use of real animals makes it fun to watch. I recommend this film for cat lovers of all ages!",1233014400,2,326,4.030769230769231
