2750193,3,B000MV8Z9K,"This six-hour mini-series is about Ros Pritchard, a middle-aged wife, mum, and supermarket manager in Eatanswill, England. It's election time, and Ros is sick of the candidates on both sides. On a whim, she fills out election papers and stands for MP.  What began as a joke begins to take on a life of its own; she forms a new party and before you know it, she's the new Prime Minister.  Life at No. 10 isn't all glamour and tea parties with the Queen however; Ros is in meetings from morning till night and hasn't time to notice her husband is drinking too much, her older daughter is acting out in troublesome ways, and her younger daughter is feeling neglected.

The story begins as a lightweight comedy about woman-power, then takes a serious turn as a political drama, and ends up as a soap opera (my favorite part), dealing with Ros' family troubles and those of her top staff.  The secret her husband has been hiding for years threatens to destroy the family, while her best friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is having a rocky relationship with a man half her age.

Unfortunately, Jane Horrocks (Ros) failed to engage me.  She wasn't charismatic enough to make me like her or care about her and wasn't ""amazing"" at all.  Ros' husband and family were a whiny, self-centered lot.  The ""Women Can Do Anything Better Than Men"" storyline was heavy-handed and monotonous.  The one performance I thoroughly enjoyed was that of Janet McTeer as the Chancellor.  She displayed a range of subtle emotions and reminded me of Helen Mirren.  All in all, it was OK as TV miniseries go, but just OK.",1190764800,4,1597,4.647686832740214
2750209,5,B000MV8Z9K,"I really enjoyed this very entertaining look at the wrangling of the British Parliament when supermarket manager Ros Pritchard is fed up with what is being offered to her in the way of representation and decided to run for Parliament herself.  Getting the common people behind her, she wins a seat even though she knows nothing about politics.

When in doubt, surround yourself with those who know what they are doing, unfortunately they all seem to have a skeleton in their closet.  And soon so does Ros even though she has promised to be honest and forthcoming with the British citizens.

Ros' unwavering honesty and innocence all comes to a boiling end when a secret is revealed and she must make a decision to be the Prime Minister with a secret or an honest above board wife and mother.  She doesn't want to lie, but she doesn't want to make those that she loves suffer.

From downed aircraft to car free save the environment days, there is never a dull moment in the life of Roz Pritchard.  I highly recommend this series with its multiple storylines and a great cast of supporting characters.",1207785600,,1099,4.66321243523316
2750210,5,B000MV8Z9K,"Anyone with an interest in politics, and the role of women in our modern society, will enjoy this drama. While Jane Horrocks is known as Bubble from AbFab, her characterization of Ros Pritchard is the polar opposite.

I first saw her in a Mike Leigh film ""Life is Sweet"" and she was excellent. In ""Little Voice"" her performance was Oscar worthy in my view, and in this series she firmly establishes herself on a par with some of the British greats who straddle comedy and drama so well (think Julie Walters, Brenda Blethyn, Judi Dench, et al). Janet McTeer and Jodhi May deliver the goods too.

I am reticent to reveal too much about the story line - except that it is certainly plausible - sometimes very funny, and very engaging. You begin to care deeply for many of the characters, and the story arc builds to a great crescendo.

There is a post script that I wish the producers had left out - but I still enjoyed this series immensely.

One drawback to British television series is that - whether a comedy or drama - in a given year only 6 episodes are produced. Like many other excellent British TV offerings - this series left me wanting more. Bravo.",1204588800,,1156,4.4904761904761905

Plenty of fish out of water antics ensue as she navigates the hallowed halls of Parliment as the first down to Earth PM.

The story has its up and downs, but I had a hard time with ""Bubble"" from Absolutely Fabulous being the PM. The writing is a bit uneven at times as well. While not a disappoint (love British comedy!), it is more middle of the road.",1198108800,2,665,4.277777777777778
2750216,3,B000MV8Z9K,"I am a big fan of Jane Horrocks after seeing her in both AbFab and the wonderful film, Little Voice (you HAVE to see that one!). Her talents were just as strong as ever in this show, as were the performances of most of the other cast members.

However, as other reviewers have noted, there are a few major flaws that resulted in a disappointing experience.

What started out as an interesting and humorous political satire (and a good one!) quickly devolved into a soap opera of personal problems, family squabbles, and unlikely crises. It was as thought they were trying to throw everything -- including the kitchen sink -- into the mix right from the start. They needed to focus on selected elements, and explore those in more depth.

The biggest flaw, however, is the ending. I found out later that the actual last episode was supposed to be a season ending ""cliffhanger"" but when the series wasn't renewed, they tacked on some text screens to summarize the plot ending. UGH.  I can't blame them -- what else could they do? But it doesn't make for good viewing.

I suppose the REAL disappointment wasn't in the show itself, but in the fact that it was cut short without a chance to grow and develop. I sure hope UK tv isn't taking a page from US network programmers who yank shows off the air at the first sign of poor or sagging ratings. Give shows a chance -- and viewers a break!",1197849600,2,1385,4.48015873015873

Part soap opera, part dramedy, this modern Masterpiece Theatre outing is graced with an ""absolutely fabulous"" turn from Jane Horrocks (proving at last that her range is well beyond zany sitcom and impersonations) and another memorable performance from amazing Janet McTeer. For those who are frustrated with the ending, it seems that the ambiquity was entirely the point...just look at the world of politics and you understand that any decision made will be wrong and hardly black and white. That's just the way of the world.

The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard was British drama at its best and had me on the edge of my seat through every episode.  This was the first Masterpiece Theatre in some time that had me waiting for Sunday night to come around like it was Christmas and I was a boy again.  This is the kind of quality drama that makes the vast chasm between Hollywood and the BBC so vividly apparent.  If only we could do quality TV like this domestically.
  Admittedly, the ending was somewhat unsatisfying.  I thought that it was reasonably clear what would happen, but utterly unsatisfying to have to speculate on it.  Hopefully this was only meant to tease us until the sequel arrives.  A true Masterpiece for the connoisseur.",1195516800,,778,4.539568345323741
2750225,2,B000MV8Z9K,"I loved the premise of this series and eagerly anticipated how the storyline would unfold.  When I saw the final episode last night on PBS, I felt ripped off.  Jane Horrocks and the other actors were very well cast in their roles, but the writing was terrible.  The series quickly digressed into a soap opera format, and the last episode left the audience in mid-muddle with no clear resolution of Ros's ethical dilemma.  ""The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard"" had lots of potential to be a novel addition to Masterpiece Theater, but it suffered from extremely poor execution.  A very sub-par Masterpiece Theater product that one hopes will not be repeated in the future.",1195344000,5,661,4.866071428571429

With many fine reviews already posted here, all I need to comment on is this:  as I just finished the 6th and final episode, it left me hanging. Perhaps more insightful viewers than myself can interpolate a conclusion... but for myself, turning to the net to try and make sense of the abrupt and seemingly unanswered ending, I found the many posts here on AMAZON (the irony of it being ""amazon""...discussing a show about a government run by mostly women lol) Of course nobody is rude enough to reveal the ending. However, I found a ratings report on Guardian UK website, showing that the ratings for this show dropped precipitously in the UK early on.  So perhaps there was an ending never produced and the show was simply dropped.  Pity.  I really wanted to know the fate of my homeland's second women leader...",1195344000,2,862,4.61437908496732

2750228,2,B000MV8Z9K,". . . rather, my wife and I both tried . . . but neither of us could get excited about this series.

For me, as an historian who is NOT British, I can only surmise that the BBC assumes its viewers honestly don't understand the British political system.  The premise that someone like Mrs. Pritchard could actually get elected requires an enormous suspension of disbelief -- and an ignorance of how the major parties in Britain operate.  If someone like Mrs. Pritchard would run on a platform that fell somewhere between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, the British political left would be so hopelessly divided as to ensure a Conservative shoo-in.  That's how a parliamentary democracy works.

The anti-monarchist attitude portrayed (at times, rather rudely) throughout was also rather unbelievable.  In reality, the anti-monarchist movement in Britain is quite small.  There is no way ""the people"" (whomever they are supposed to be) would stand for the proposed wholesale dismantling of monarchy and tradition suggested.

""Mrs. Pritchard"" also demonstrates (at least, to me) the tyranny of the radical far-left.  Once in office, Mrs. Pritchard demonstrates (or at least attempts) what is essentially government by fiat.  Whatever she wants, she forces -- all in the name of ""the people"".

Virtually every significant political, economic, social, or moral issue that could have been crammed into six episodes was crammed in!  It was a little much for me!

Finally, as my wife complained, the second disk -- the final three episodes -- had far more in common with a soap opera than with a serious drama.

Two stars because truly the BBC does produce quality work.  But this was so obviously agenda-driven in an offensive manner, that I can't give it more than that.  (In all seriousness, if ""Mrs. Pritchard"" had been presented as a satire or as a farce, I would have found it much funnier!)",1194220800,2,1900,4.965189873417722
2750229,2,B000MV8Z9K,"Given the premise I really wanted to like this series but found it boring and lacking any sort of depth from the first episode. The characters were very one dimensional and you never get to the point of caring about any of them. Again, interesting premise but not a show that you are looking forward to the next episode. I found watching all the episodes a real chore and I was just waiting for each one to be over. I'm typically interested in a lot of the BBC shows yet this one just didn't deliver.",1193356800,5,500,4.273684210526316
2750230,2,B000MV8Z9K,"I think the biggest problem I had with THE AMAZING MRS. PRITCHARD is that even after viewing all six episodes, I still wasn't sure what this miniseries was trying to be.

Given the rather thin, unrealistic and somewhat fantastical nature of the story, were the producers aiming towards fun, family entertainment?  Probably not, given some of the language used and some of the topics discussed.

Was the goal to have a sharp, biting commentary on the state of politics in the world today?  Again, probably not, since the script tended to back away whenever it approached anything deep, the serious subjects were almost always resolved with a joke, and the satire never really found its teeth.

Did the creators want to put a spotlight on the difficulty that political figures have in maintaining both a Teflon-like public exterior and a private, personal family life?  Again, I didn't think so, because -- while this made up a number of subplots -- the series never really found anything new to say on the subject.

So that's where I was after six episodes.  Actually, that's where I was at the end of the first episode.  The show's flaws were evident from the beginning and no story-arcs or sudden character revelations could save it.

The premise is relative straightforward.  The eponymous (or is it amazing?) Mrs. Pritchard is a very capable supermarket manager.  During the run-up to an election for the British parliament, two opposing candidates get up on their respective soapboxes in front of Pritchard's shop.  Harsh words lead to physical blows and -- with the news cameras running -- Mrs. Pritchard verbally lays into both politicians, ridiculing them for their inability to get simple things done and their predilection for lying to the voting public.

Her commonsense message set off a media storm, and by the end of the day she has already filed to run for the seat herself and a nascent political party is beginning to coalesce into existence around her.

And this is where I left the party.

Of course what Mrs. Pritchard is saying has validity.  The problem I had is twofold.  First of all, what she is saying is far too obvious to really be truly revolutionary.  Second, her message is the exact same message that everyone running for office against an incumbent says.  They all criticize their opponents for the above, then turn to the camera and promise to tell the people the truth.  Sometimes it works.  Sometimes it doesn't.  But it isn't a particularly world changing set of statements.

Now, as annoyed as I was with the first episode, I was willing to swallow this unbelievable premise if only to see how the writers would deal with the plot device of having a genuinely ordinary woman as the head of government.  But the types of illogical leaps required to reach the initial premise were repeated over and over.  Seemingly impossible tasks were achieved simply by having Mrs. Pritchard assert that they would be achieved.

Alternatively, conflicts would arise from absolutely nowhere, be given a huge amount of attention, but disappear without trace.  While some threads did manage to reach a logical conclusion, I waiting for some of the earlier story-lines to at least be referenced again (if not wrapped up), yet I was left disappointed.  (To be fair, it's possible that the producers were expecting to continue into another season/series, but since that doesn't seem to be happening I can only judge by what is available to me.)

THE AMAZING MRS. PRITCHARD is one of those situations where I end up feeling sorry for the cast, because for the most part I think the actors and actresses did an extremely good job, especially when one considers what they had to work with.

Janet McTeer did a lot with very little.  As the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the second-in-command to Jane Horrocks' Prime Minister, she was excellent as a commanding presence without falling into melodrama.  Jodhi May as the political spin-doctor could have easily turned in a one-note performance, but she did not.

The actors playing Pritchard's family were also quite good.  I found Steven Mackintosh as Mr. Pritchard to be a very sympathetic character despite the script leaving him in most scenes with little to do other than look haggard and sip from a half-empty tumbler of whiskey.  Credit is also due to Carey Mulligan as the elder daughter who managed to infuse her character with a real sense of grace despite the somewhat random (and inexplicable) indignities the script threw her way.

Despite the best efforts of everyone on the front side of the camera, I couldn't really believe anything that MRS. PRITCHARD was trying to say.  The political message is too shallow to be taken seriously.  The satire never really connects with anything, because it isn't sure what it's aiming at.  And while the script does raise the occasional smile, I couldn't really find a level to enjoy the drama on.  Consider me unamazed.",1193184000,4,4936,4.884615384615385
2750231,5,B000MV8Z9K,"When asked this question Ros Pritchard (Jane Horrocks) responded with ""Yes, I think I could""  and started a chain of events that ultimately lead this wife, mother and supermarket manager from her home in the north of England to 10 Downing Street.  Her dissatisfaction with chosing between the lesser of two evils at the polling place struck a chord with British voters who turned her candidacy-as-protest-gesture into a grassroots movements that swept the country.  Once elected (an occurance that took Ros and her family totally by surprise) she found herself in a position that she had no preparation for, one that she only vaguely understood.  Ros quickly discovered that this was not a position that she could not just step away from too many were depending on her and Ros was nothing if not dependable.

The series opens with Ros entering politics and continues through the next couple of years of time in office.  We see her grow from well meaning housewife and store manager into a polished, determined leader.  This is a rather large cast with quite a few story lines.  In addition to Ros, her husband and daughters there are various members of her government, all of whom have their own issues and stories, which is a bit of a challenge for the viewer to keep track of who is who and all their various story lines.

The series was apparently intended to have at least a second season but was abandoned due to low ratings.  Too bad because this is an example of something British TV does so well, taking the current world and giving it a bit of a twist to create a totally plausible alternate reality.  Another strength common with British TV is the strong acting.  Most of the cast has appeared in various other productions with which the viewer will probably be familiar.  The most astonishing, at least to this viewer, was the main character, Ros (Jane Horrocks) - aka the airheaded Bubble from AbFab - as the Prime Minister!?

There are a few problems with this otherwise excellent show.  On the technical side the opening episode had a couple of sceens with a very annoyingly shaky camera and background music that nearly drowned out the dialog.  American viewers will also be left a bit confused by the British Parliamentary system and that many of the senior government officals seem to live in government supplied residences at or near 10 Downing Street.  The only extra included with this set is a filmography of the main actors.  An interview or two with the series creator, writers or director would have been welcome additions, particularly if some points of British politics could be explained and perhaps an idea of where the series was intended to go next.

All in all this is a fine series, with an engaging, well told story performed by an excellent cast.  The story is both entertaining and thought provoking.",1192924800,,2835,4.770491803278689
2750232,5,B000MV8Z9K,I was skeptical of this series.  How realistic could they make this?  The amazing Ros Pritchard is your every day woman who speaks out about the current state of politics in England.  Her speaking out turns into a snowball that gets her into the Prime Minister's position.  The writing is witty and current.  The acting is stellar and keeps you wanting more.  A truly amazing series where the old character from Absolutely Fabulous (Bubbles) never appears.,1192752000,,456,4.934210526315789
2750233,4,B000MV8Z9K,"So we've all at least seen one episode of the West Wing (and that's really all I've seen) and we probably have a pretty good idea how the US government works (well, I guess that's debatable.)

I've always wanted to know a bit more about British politics (or anything else international, that is) so I thought I'd check out this series. This isn't your typical realistic drama about a Labour party leader, rather, how someone has made it to the highest point of government from absolutely nothing.

It is interesting to see how the characters, most notably Mrs. Pritchard, have defied political logic and eroded the political stereotypes of untruthfulness and circumlocution. The series clearly portrays that politics isn't an easy game -- despite certain US leaders that try to portray that image.

Face it that American TV as of late has nothing really original. We've got plenty of CSI and Law and Order clones and few worthwhile sitcoms. Dramas don't really delve into the societal issues we face today. The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard, for the most part, does. There's humor and the many awe-shocking moments (especially in the first episode of the series.) The middle episodes repeat some of the same themes, nevertheless, the series remains interesting until the end and definitely worthwhile for us Americans on the other side of the pond.",1192320000,2,1341,4.977678571428571
2750244,4,B000MV8Z9K,"First, let me say I might not be the most objective reviewer of this series. I am a Jane Horrocks fan. How could you not love the woman who brought ""Bubbles"" to life on Ab Fab? She was great in ""Life is Sweet"" and dead amazing in ""Little voice"" (a role written for her and her amazing voice). ""Chicken Run"" ""Cabaret"" ""Wyrd Sisters"" She's just great. So that we loved this series is not a huge surprise. We, however, were surprised at how much we liked it.

The story of the series goes, Mrs. Pritchard is a grocery store manager. During elections, two candidates running for MP mix it up outside her store. She tells them, running government ""is not rocket science."" And decides to run. MPs from all sides join her ""Purple Party,"" and she ends up the Prime Minister...We get to see her form her government and deal with world problems (the assassination of an African leader's family) and problems in her government (bribes & MPs on boozers) and within her own family (wild teenage daughter, skeletons in her husband's closet). All tightly woven into six (mostly) believable scripts.

It really leavse you wanting more due in a good part to the wonderful cast. Jane's Mrs. Pritchard is idealistic and naive, but she's determined to be an honest politician and not take crap from members of the opposition. Janet McTeer gives a jaw-dropingly realistic performance as the Chsncellor of the Exchequer. She's a 45 year old career politician who's lonely...and falls for a 25 year old staff member--but what you think will happen doesn't. Honestly, I can't think of an actor who didn't give their role their all. really good performances all around.

The British audience might find this partisan...and they might not believe it to the extent that WE did (being nearly clueless as to the inner workings of British politics)...but we loved every minute of it. If only ABC had done as good a job as this with ""Commander in Chief"" it might have lasted more than four episodes.

This is 354 minutes of excellent television. It's funny...and both of us teared up several times...and pulse-pounding. So we WOULD have liked a few extras on the DVD (interviews at least) and there were a few (FEW) weak moments in the script--we did say ""Oh, she wouldn't have done that"" or ""Wasn't that a little too convienent?"" but it's TV, and as I said excellent TV.

If you missed it on Masterpiece Theater on PBS, this DVD collection is well worth your entertainment dollar.",1192320000,3,2450,4.7283372365339575
2750245,4,B000MV8Z9K,"A surprisingly engaging drama, by turns funny and wrenching, The Amazing Mrs Pritchard is very watchable.  The first episode's light comedic tone rapidly gives way to a much harder-edged dramatic feeling as the stakes are raised from dark-horse candidate to overwhelmed Prime Minister with family problems -- it's not terribly realistic, but plenty of fun to watch.  At six episodes, however, it feels somewhat incomplete.  Recommended.",1192147200,,436,5.575757575757576
2750246,3,B000MV8Z9K,"I thought this was an average show with a great premise.  As an avid BBC fan maybe I expected more from this series.  The acting is good and the storyline interesting but it wears a little thin.  The plot was appealing with an ordinary woman getting tired of the same old politics and when voicing her discontent becomes a candidate herself.  This was brillant and I liked where the series was going as we followed her ride from a working mother (store manager) to the big time playing with the big boys.  The portrayal of the inner sactum of british politics was not fascinating enough to keep my attention.  Most of the characters lacked depth, in my opinion, and were too flat to evoke any emotional bond.  This was especially true for lead character (played by Jane Horricks, a great actress).  The added family issues (wandering husband with long ago illicit affair? and rebellious daughter) while interesting, just made it a soap opera not a political drama.

A friend from London tells me this series was not a huge hit in the UK so I'm wondering why it was released in the US?  Maybe I'm just not getting it and it deserves more credit.  Maybe I'll give it another view but I really don't think I want to spend another 6 hours to watch this miniseries again.",1192060800,3,1266,4.533039647577093
2750247,4,B000MV8Z9K,"This short-lived British series is a pleasant, if not particularly complex or artful, diversion.  The central premise is that of an ethical, competent everywoman  who, in a few weeks, creates a new political party that in turn takes a majority in the House of Commons - making her the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

The five episodes after the pilot play out the fantasy of many of us who are politics junkies:  what would it be like for a ""normal"" family to suddenly be a world leader.  The plot is fairly predictable, as we watch Mrs. Pritchard attempt to adapt to the overwhelming responsibilities of 10 Downing Street while also dealing with the family stress (and scandals) of her new role.  There are a few fun surprises along the way, and - if nothing else - the shows are, for an American audience, an enjoyable introduction to the British parliamentary system.

The acting is well-played, and it was the convincing, sympathetic characters that encouraged my family to watch the entire series.  (American families with younger children may want to remember that the BBC is more permissive on language than the U.S. FCC is.)  The number of strong, female characters in the show also offer the opportunity for some thoughtful conversations about the present and future role of women in politics.

Perhaps the show was a bit to0 earnest or naive for British audiences; but, earnest and naive political junkie that I am, I'm sorry it did not have a longer run.

British television (including the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4) has set the bar very high for television shows with a political theme.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yes-Minister-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B00008DP4B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yes Minister - The Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yes-Prime-Minister-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B00009XN37/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yes, Prime Minister - The Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;were brilliant comedies.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Very-British-Coup/dp/B00009WNVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Very British Coup</a>&nbsp;was a wonderfully dark, dystopian look at a Labour Government at odds with the `power elite'.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Cards-Trilogy-House-of-Cards-To-Play-the-King-The-Final-Cut/dp/B00009MGGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Cards Trilogy (House of Cards / To Play the King / The Final Cut)</a>&nbsp;was a savage (but humorous) look at the rise to power of the devilishly Machiavellian Francis Urquhart (known to all as F.U.) as he clawed his way to the office of Prime Minister.  The bar is set very high for ""The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard"" so to say that it doesn't quite live up the very best British political series is not to say it isn't worth watching.  On the contrary, this was an entertaining series.

The story is set up when the very efficient and likeable supermarket manager Mrs. Pritchard witnesses a very public and very juvenile quarrel in front of her store between the Labour and Conservative Party candidates for Parliament during a general election campaign.  No sooner does Mrs. Pritchard break up the fight then she claims that she could do better than that lot.  The remark is picked up by the press and the next thing you know Mrs. Pritchard is not only standing for a seat in Parliament but becomes the leader of a grass-roots third party, ""the Purple Alliance"".  By the end of the first episode she is elected to office and the Purple Alliance finds itself in power.  This first episode does a very nice job in making this whole thing seem plausible - no mean feat.  The rest of the first series of episodes (disc 1) takes Pritchard through her first, tumultuous year in office.  The second series of episodes (disc 2) finds her firmly in power after a year but facing a series of family and political crisis that threaten both her party and her personal beliefs.

There are both strengths and weaknesses in the acting.  The strengths are in the `political' cast.  Jane Horrocks (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Voice/dp/6305428298/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Voice</a>

Johdi May (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tipping-the-Velvet/dp/B00011Y1QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tipping the Velvet</a>) does an excellent job of portraying Pritchard's Chief of Staff.  Last but not least, Janet McTeer does a  superb job as the Purple Alliance's Chancellor of the Exchequer.  In fact, McTeer's performance is probably the highlight of the series and actually tends to overshadow Horrocks whenever they have a scene together.

The weaknesses are found in the casting of Pritchard's family.  Both Steven Mckintosh as Mr. Pritchard and Carey Mulligan as their troubled daughter Emily left me cold.  Further, the story line involving the family crisis struck me as more suited to a soap opera than a BBC production.

Bottom line: There is a lot to like in ""The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard"" but the political story line is a bit weighed down by the family story line.  All in all - this is well worth watching and probably better than what you are likely to find on the television set on any given evening.  Although it doesn't quite live up to the expectations of some of the best British political series exported to the U.S. it was still an enjoyable series.",1191888000,5,4612,6.422330097087379
2750249,3,B000MV8Z9K,"Viewing this six-hour UK miniseries was an unusual experience.  I expected the show to be a comedy - after all, it's premise of an ordinary middle-class woman becoming Prime Minister easily lends itself to lighthearted laughs.  This isn't the case.  While humor is definitely a strong element throughout, the show is very much a serious drama.  The six episodes are very good - densely packed with multiple interlocking storylines, each episode moving along at a brisk pace.  The acting is uniformly excellent as well.  Based on those strengths, I'm tempted to rate the show higher - but there is a problem:  it ends with a never-to-be-resolved cliffhanger.

Apparently the show did not perform well in the ratings when it aired last year in the UK.  As a result, it seems the show is not returning for a second season.  There are a couple of screens containing brief text in an attempt to tie up the most important aspects of the story.  These, of course, can't be discussed without revealing too much of the story.  But suffice it to say, this is a highly unsatisfactory ending to an otherwise involving TV show.  Too many questions are left unanswered - it's literally only half the story.

The main storyline concerns the title character and her unlikely career change from grocery store manager to Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  Her decision to run for such an esteemed position stemmed from her frustration with the available candidates, as well as her friends and family assuring her that she could do a better job than any of them.  Surrounded by a skilled staff - all of whom she relies heavily upon - Ros Pritchard finds herself completely ovewhelmed with her immense responsibilities.  Throughout the six episodes, we see her trying to adapt and adjust without compromising her most important principle:  direct honesty to the people of the UK.  She strives to be the people's PM to an unprecedented degree.

In addition to being politically out of her league, the show details the (mostly) negative effects her career move has on her family life.  As a mother of two, Ros finds herself unable to devote nearly the same amount of time she once did to her two girls.  Her marriage becomes strained as her husband finds himself more and more a bystander rather than participant in his own family life.  And in a key plot development, some potentially damaging family secrets are uncovered and attempted to be dealt with.

I found all the character-based elements to be very compelling.  The excellent acting by a mostly-female ensemble, achored by Jane Horrocks's Mrs. Pritchard, deserves special note.  Horrocks does a good job of conveying Ros Pritchard's hesitancy at making decisions of such great importance.  Jodhi May is superb as Pritchard's 'right hand woman' Miranda Lennox.  Also particularly noteworthy is Carey Mulligan as Ros's college-age daughter.  It's really a shame we won't be able to see any more of these characters.

As for the show's political content, I had a more mixed reaction.  For one, not knowing much about the British political system I was often a little confused about who everyone was and what their function is.  But the political issues that are dealt with, for the most part, are the same issues we face in the U.S.  However, there is a somewhat haphazard approach to this throughout the show.  Initially there is a focus on terrorist threats, which doesn't really go anywhere before switching gears to environmental issues.  I'm guessing that the goal was to provide an overview of the many challenges Ros was facing, but it seemed a little less focused than it could have been.

All things considered, this was an intriguing and well-made miniseries that I would recommend cautiously recommend.  The DVD offers nothing that wasn't shown on TV originally, with the exception of aforementioned brief text notes at the conclusion of episode six.  It's unfortunate that the show's creative team wasn't able to discuss (via commentaries or interviews) their intent for the show beyond the initial six episodes.  Perhaps they could have offered a clearer idea of the plan than the few lines that pop up on screen before the final credits roll.  I couldn't help but feel cheated, even though that wasn't the intent.",1191801600,32,4266,4.9284712482468445
2750250,3,B000MV8Z9K,"The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard tells of the amazing story of the rise of Ros Pritchard from a grocery store manager to the Prime Minister's office. The slogan of her Purple Alliance is ""Politics is not Rocket Science"", but as she later discovers, there is definitely some intelligent thought invested in making split-second decisions.

I watched the series episodes one after the other as it was engaging enough to make me wonder what happened next. It also has some great actors - Jane McTeer put in a strong performance as the Councellor of the Exchequer and in my opinion was the real hero of this series. Jodhi May gave another great performance as the right arm of the Prime Minister. Jane Horrocks was good too, but was overshadowed a little by the other strong actresses surrounding her. I watched the series with great anticipation but episode after episode left me admiring the Councellor more than the Prime Minister. The series started off with a bang, the speech Ros Prtichard made as a Prime Minister was inspiring as it urged the people to think about what they wanted for their country and to be more involved in politics.

The first episode was believable but subsequently by the second episode I had a sense of disappointment that this series was not shaping up to be a real political drama as I'd expected. It would have been interesting to learn of the reforms made by the new Prime Minister given her uniqueness as ""not being a real politician"" despite the ire of the opposition. It looked promising for a while when the Prime Minister chose to send her daughter to a inner city school with a dodgy reputation...it could have turned into an episode about education reform. Instead, the series never seemed to make any hard-hitting points.

After the first 2 episodes it began to seem more like a soap opera which detailed  Ros Pritchard's family life which was disintegrating due to her new job. It made half-hearted attempt to show some political reform, the best of them being a no-cars Wednesday which the Prime Minister announced on a whim after a G8 summit right around the completion of her first 12 months in office. That to me was where the series turned into a mockery of real governance. What Prime Minister would announce that on a whim without thinking of how this plan would be executed, even if that PM was store manager in their past life? In fact, her role as a grocery store manager would have taught her the importance of planning and execution.

The series seemed to run out of fizz in the last few episodes and only the Councellor Catherine Walker (Janet McTeer) kept it interesting enough to keep watching.

At the end I was left thinking how great this show could have been if only it had exploited the true potential of what seemed like a great plot.",1191715200,3,2789,4.681632653061224
2750251,4,B000MV8Z9K,"This six-hour BBC miniseries tells the story of a grocery store manager who decides, after watching two candidates for Parliament engage in fisticuffs outside her store, that she could do a better job. As luck would have it, a TV camera catches her saying so, and soon she finds herself in the middle of a whirlwind political movement. She inspires other women to run for office, and many defect from their political parties to join her. Come election day, her party wins--and she becomes prime minister. (Forgive me--I've just told you how the first hour ends.)

But all is not so simple for Ros Pritchard, the titular star of the show (played with aplomb by Jane Horrocks). Her husband does not support her choice and urges her to refuse the job, fearful that his own secrets will come to light if she takes office. And within hours of her election, she faces the first of several crises that demonstrate to her that being a world leader is tougher than it looked on TV.

Ros rises to the challenge, though, and for four of its six hours this miniseries is a delightful fantasy about how the world would be if ""the great British people"" got behind a leader with common-sense ideas and a desire to effect real change. Supporting players generate much of the interest, with no one's story more compelling and intriguing than that of Catherine Walker, a former Tory and now the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Catherine is the voice of wisdom and experience that Ros desperately needs, but as portrayed by the stellar Janet McTeer she is a woman with regrets that need working out, as well. Watching her work through her own issues while keeping the country running is a gripping experience.

I limit myself to four of five stars because the final hour of the series goes a bit off the rails. Without giving anything away, all I dare say is that the two days depicted in the last hour proceed as if the responsibilities of government have been temporarily suspended. And Americans, used to our tidy endings, probably won't love the way the series concludes; the text at the end, which British audiences evidently did not see when the program aired on the BBC, seems to wrap things up in a bow but actually makes the conclusion less believable.

Despite that, this is a fine series that anyone with an interest in politics will heartily enjoy. Bonus points if you're an Anglophile!",1191542400,18,2376,4.690647482014389
2750252,4,B000MV8Z9K,"When rival candidates for Parliament come to blows outside the store Ros Pritchard manages, she realizes that British politics has lost touch with the people.  Determined to make the point that the people deserve a better choice she sets out to run for a seat in Parliament herself.  Unexpectedly, she captures the imagination of the voters, and finds herself the leader of a new majority and the new Prime Minister.  How does a woman with no political experience run the British Government?  Mrs. Pritchard's proposals are both unorthodox and interesting, and, for better or worse, they change the future of British politics forever.

The high production standards of this series are everywhere evident, from the photography to the script writing.  The dialog is fast (think ""West Wing"" with British accents), requiring the viewer to pay close attention, lest they miss important information.  While many of the political ideas included here (i.e., moving Parliament out of London or the car-less Wednesdays) are seem to gimmicky to be based in reality, we also get a glimpse into the kinds of difficult decisions and situations that world leaders have to routinely cope with.  The ending of the series, while not entirely satisfying, does reflect the reality of how difficult it can be to succeed in politics without compromising one's principles.  Overall, an entertaining series, that also serves up plenty of important ideas for thought and discussion.",1191456000,,1457,5.218884120171674
2750253,5,B000MV8Z9K,"I adore Jane Horrocks, and even more now for her efforts shown here.  Being in the US, we miss out on a lot of UK talent.  Be it recording artists or actors, they never get the exposure they deserve.  Jane is one of those talents, two-fold.

Those that don't know who Jane Horrocks is may recall her from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Absolutely-Fabulous-Complete-Series-1-3/dp/B000AJHIT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Absolutely Fabulous - Complete Series 1-3</a>"", but still not major exposure for her.  Her most brilliant film, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Voice/dp/6305428298/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Voice</a>"", shows her vocal talents and how she can channel Billie Holiday and Judy Garland with eerie results.  I highly suggest the soundtrack, as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Horrocks-The-Further-Adventures-of-Little-Voice/dp/B00004Z51R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Horrocks - The Further Adventures of Little Voice</a>.  Fans of Robbie Williams can hear duets together on both of their cds.

With The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard, we see Jane in a different light.  In a US mentality, think ""Desperate Houswives"" meets ""The West Wing"".  You really don't know what to expect with this mini-series, and I watched all six hours in one sitting.  There are humorous and impossible elements, but also serious current events delivered with great emotion.  A very well rounded production.

We meet Mrs. Pritchard as a Manager in an over-staffed grocery store.  Basically the best Boss you could ever have, and too good to be true.  Unfortunately, there is so much going on in the first 30 minutes, you really have to pay attention to the thin character development.  You are basically getting a taste of what's to come, but after the first half hour, the drama begins. You are then overloaded with a complete political campaign all the way to her becoming Prime Minister ... all in one episode.

We eventually get to know the characters in depth.  Mrs. Pritchard knows nothing about politics, and basically ran for office to prove a point.  She does not expect to get anywhere, and just wanted to ruffle some feathers.  Surrounding herself with people who know what to do is the only way she gets through it.  However, she ultimately wins the hearts of the country, and wins the election by a landslide.  It did not come without scandal attempts at trying to bring this housewife's reputation down, but not being in politics to begin with, made it hard for them to do.

Dirt does eventually come up in the family, and some additional dirt is created by greed. But Mrs. Pritchard is always keeping it all together as best she can.  It's an interesting take on women in power. Seeing her bring her fellow female friends into her cabinet is just refreshing.  If anything, it makes a case that a woman should be running America at this point.

The new Prime Minister is not surrounded by all light-hearted fluff.  Her first day included making decisions she will hold with her the rest of her life.  Efforts to connect with other Presidential names early on, go terribly wrong.  And outside attempts to bring her down persist to the point of seeing power she never knew she had.  She never thought she would be where she was, never thought she could do it, and never thought about dealing with Bush.

The show is set at the time when Tony Blair was being replaced.  Blair is  a phone call away for anything she needs, but when she has to meet the Queen, she breaks down her reality of fear.  What follows is surprising, and exciting.

I only wish it were a complete series, and not a six episode mini-series.  There are great characters that are rushed and could be elaborated.  But, I still give it five stars for the outstanding acting of all involved, and the superb camera work.

As far as the packaging and physical DVD aspects, it is fair at best.  There are only two DVDs, so they could have simply been put in a normal 2 disc case.  But there are two full size cases, and a sleeve.  A sleeve with no information on cast or production.  There is a sheet inside, but with nothing of valued information.  The DVDs themselves do not contain any extras and offer nothing but the six episodes.  With that said, the content could have been put on one disc.  But, I cannot hold any of the cosmetics against the production.

BBC did a great job on a great mini-series.",1191456000,,4516,5.141483516483516
2750264,5,B000MV8Z9K,"Simply Amazing!

Within the first few minutes, this splendidly-acted television series hooked me! A combination of political thriller, suspense yarn, and comedy in the best sense of the word, the story about a spunky but ordinary super-market manager, wife, and mother, who thinks she can do a better job in parliament than the ""more-of-the-same"" politicians in Westminster--and then gets enough votes and women supporters on board to form a government--made me feel not only good but also empowered. Jane Horrocks is delightful in the title role; the rest of the cast (whose names I cannot tell you because Acorn Media did not feel it necessary to supply them; and the print on the end credits was too small) is outstanding (We've seen them all before on various Masterpiece Theatre productions, including ""Jewel in the Crown"" and ""Daniel Deronda."") [Exception: After watching the show on PBS, I finally learned the name of the magnificent Janet McTeer who plays the Chancellor of the Exchecquer to perfection!].

The story of how the women can do a better job of running the government than the men is the Greek comic playwright Aristophanes' ""Lysistrata"" and ""The Assemblywomen"" in modern dress, and just as much fun. One of my favorite moments is when Mrs. Pritchard rings up Tony Blair at 3:00 A.M. to ask where the secret exit is from #10 (Downing Street) so she can get away from the non-stop scrutiny that goes with the office of Prime Minister (Of course, now she would be ringing up Gordon Brown.).

Some American viewers may not understand Mrs. Pritchard's Leeds accent at first (and Acorn Media, as usual, supplies no English--or any other--subtitles). It took some adjusting of my ears before I got used to it, and I listen to the BBC every night. But it is worth persisting. I must say, I learned so much about how a majority leader is elected and how a government is formed in the UK from watching this series, which also paints a vivid picture of how the Prime Minister is besieged with appointments from morning to night. I found these details absorbing. And, at the same time, the story is so solid, that my attention did not flag for one second.

If you enjoyed ""House of Cards,"" you will enjoy the amazing Mrs. Pritchard (who is the perfect antidote for Francis Urquhart).

At any rate, Mrs. Pritchard gets my vote!",1191369600,3,2335,4.812967581047381
2750265,4,B000MV8Z9K,"Being an American, I don't get to watch much BBC programing. Which is, of course, sad for me. That being said, I am a fan of many programs, and when The Amazing Mrs Prichard popped up on my radar, I was happy to watch the six episode BBC mini series.

I would be lying if I said I knew any of the actors in this series. The star here is Jane Horrocks, who reminds me of Princess Diana.

You can read what this series is about from the description above. A working mom becomes Prime Minister after starting her own political party (The Purple Party. The artist formally known as Prince is said to have donated millions to them.) It seems that the entire Purple Party is made up almost exclusively by women. There is never any real mention why this is, or if it is a party of/by women only. But this series sees almost every cabinet member is a woman, again for no reason given.

The entire series was somewhat farfetched. Being honest seems to be the only qualification needed for Pritchard to become both the head of the Purple Party, as well as Prime Minister. It plays out like a weak The West Wing-lite. No one political subject is given much room to breath, save for the mandate to not drive once a week. (That would never work in the U.S.)

The husband and two children of the Prime Minister is given ample time to develop as characters, as is a few other key cabinet members. Beyond that, most are simply paper cutouts, not given enough time or script to tell their story.

And it is the story here that is the draw, at least right up to the end. And as much as I enjoyed the six hours spent watching this mini-series, I did feel somewhat cheated at the very end. Rather than showing what happened after all was said and done, the viewer was simply given two paragraphs of text to close our the show. It's almost as if the writers or producers either ran out of time, or energy to properly close out the series. It really, really needed at least one more episode to wrap it all up, and give the viewers a sense of closure.

Jane Horrocks is great in this roll. I would enjoy seeing her in another series. She does a great job of showing the changes a year of being Prime Minister has on both her physical and physiological self. Very convincing.

I enjoyed this, even with the left wanting more ending.",1191369600,,2308,4.316397228637413

Managing to contain the sensitivies and complexities of the material it is attacking and still retain a strong human edge,  the program is able to touch on sensitive issues such as fear of foreign attacks, marriage indescretions, abortion and more without it feeling like a weekly storyline ripped from the headlines.  The cast and crew here have done a wonderful job of creating a believable world that viewers will want to return to until the final episode.  There is enough character development here for a full series so the plug feels pulled a little early but my wife, my mother, and I all found this a refreshing respite from the general broadcast swill spilling into our living rooms.",1191196800,,929,4.646341463414634

Ros Pritchard is a successful supermarket manager in England who takes great delight in dealing with her employees and customers as important people.  A couple of local politicians get into a shoving match in front of the store, and she lectures them on civility, responsible stewardship, and listening to the people.  Scarcely a day later, she has announced that she will be running for that particular MP seat.

It is a whirlwind campaign, that grabs the interest of the nation.

And Ros Pritchard becomes the newest Prime Minister!  Really!  The Queen asks her to form the next government!

Alas, being a popularly elected government does not make it easier to deal with foreign relations, the death of soldiers, terrorist attacks, global climate change, headstrong children, and previously hidden (and unknown to Ros) skeletons in her closet.

This series will never show on American television.  The occasional coarse language would get television networks fined.  Yet the language is a critical component of this show, demonstrating passions:  anger, fear, and resolve.  The viewer really gets a ""flavor"" for the non-stop action in national politics, as well as the importance and role of those political handlers that are always present.  In the US, would this be Karl Rove's function?  And how does Ros make her decisions?  She asks herself... what would her fellow citizens do?

The brilliance of The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard is in the complexity of the characters, the twists and turns of the plots, and the realistic depiction of human nature.

You will want The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard on your ballot.

Alas, the producers don't spoon-feed you every detail.  There are times where there are jumps of months between episodes.  By the final episode, you will still have to use your imagination to decide what happens to who.

2750269,5,B000MV8Z9K,"I was hooked from the start of watching this miniseries written by Sally Wainright and starring Jane Horrocks in the lead role. It consists of 6 episodes on two DVDs, a total of approximately 354 minutes (nearly 6 hours) of viewing time. It is a satirical look at what happens when an ordinairy concerned citizen, who is fed up with ""business as usual"" of the political process, voices her opinions. A grass roots movement develops to elect her to office and before too long, she is interviewed on television programs. Kitty Porter, the wealthy owner of the grocery store chain for whom Mrs. Pritchard works as a manager, becomes one of her financial supporters. ""Politics is not rocket science"" becomes the slogan for her political party called the ""Purple Alliance"". Besides local support, Mrs. Pritchard attracts defectors from the Labour and Tory parties, such as secretaries, chancellors and ministers. She even manages to attract a famous television investigative reporter, Miranda Lennox, to become the spokes person for her political team. Something about the common sense approach that Ros takes resonates with the public, the citizens who are fed up and join her party in large numbers. One of the best scenes is when Ros Pritchard is set up to debate Catherine Walker, a famous Tory MP (Member of Parliament) on live television. Before the program, the two ladies accidentally meet in the ladies washroom, unknown to each other, and share some personal space. After looking in the mirror and realize with whom they were dealing, they exchange some well placed barbs before the actual debate. When Ros proves how well prepared she is with knowledge about Catherine's background, she adds ""Perhaps you are in the wrong party"". After which there is a pause and Catherine asks, ""Are you offering me a job?"" The rest is history ...

This set of two DVDs is broken down into three episodes per DVD. Each episode connects with the previous one and builds on the story line and plot in an amusing and serious fashion. Mrs. Pritchard is elected with an overwhelming majority. Ros learns how to function in her new role and is surrounded by experienced and knowledgeable staff. Yet Ros is still debating her abilities and qualifications when she is summoned to meet the Queen. The Queen reassures her that everything will not come to a grinding halt based on your decisions. She receives a congratulatory phone call from President Bush and makes a political faux pas. She wants to distance herself from the supportive position which Tony Blair took regarding the war in Iraq. However, she is faced with a conundrum, several French soldiers were shot down in Irag and President Chiraq of France is asking for British help. Ros provides Britain's ally with help, knowing it places embedded British soldiers at risk if they are captured. Ros had promised the British people two things, 1) she will never lie and 2) she will never mislead them. However, unknown to her, Kitty has paid off several people to keep silent about a secret matter which involved Ros' husband, which may later come to haunt Ros. Although, Ros knew nothing about it, if it were made public, by default she would have to resign as Prime Minister.

On the second DVD, Ros has now been in office as Prime Minister for one full year. She has grown into the job but continues to make occasional off the cuff remarks during interviews which drives her Chancellor of Financial Affairs absolutely crazy. Any such pronouncements are publicly viewed as offical policy which commits the government into tackling and funding particular projects with serious implications. One such project is ""Green Wednesday"" which supports Britain''s commitment to using less fossil fuel and decreasing energy consumption as signed in the Kyoto Agreements. There could be serious backlashes from this project which the Prime Minister did not consider. As it turned out, it became an overwhelming success and a great example for all of Europe. Along with huge successes, Ros also faces politically explosive crises. One is when an airplane crash thought to be caused by a terrorist attack turns out to be from air safety negligence. A British official failed to represent  British interests during a European Union meeting and had signed a Directive which lowered the safety standards of airlines. Ros managed to skirt this near political disaster and remain unscathed and unmarred. However, there is a skeleton lurking in her closet which could cause her downfall. She is unaware of her husband's participation in a cover-up activity fifteen years ago at the firm where he worked and that it is about to be exposed. I love how the writers build suspense and drama into each episode as new problems arise for the inexperienced Prime Minister to work out. She faces near disasters with courage and integrity and in the end must deal with the most difficult one of all involving her husband. One must view the entire miniseries to fully appreciate how Ros Pritchard develops into the role of Prime Minister and how her basic instincts provide her with political savvy and survival skills. This whole miniseries is a thoroughly enjoyable and riveting viewing experience. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1190937600,,5240,4.993135011441647
2750270,4,B000MV8Z9K,"First appearing on BBC One in the fall of 2006, this is called a mini-series on the product page.  It was broadcast in six episodes so I suppose the term applies.  However, I always admired British television because, unlike a lot of American television series, which long outstay the ""sell by"" date, the British have a story, tell the story and then go home.

This was written by Sally Wainwright, whose work is not familiar to me.  From what I could find she had written for some British soaps including Coronation Street and yes, this is a bit soapy.  Her stated motivation for writing this particular story is one I can sympathize with entirely-- she found herself facing the ballot box and realized that she didn't want to vote for anyone.

Mrs. Pritchard is someone who at least promises to be honest even if she doesn't get it right always.

Not brilliant but a good time waster.  And it was wonderful to see Bubbles (Jane Horrock's role in Absolutely Fabulous) again.",1190851200,,975,4.6608187134502925
2750271,4,B000MV8Z9K,"Acorn Media has released a two disc presentation of the BBC drama The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard.  This six part series follows the adventures of Mrs. Pritchard (Jane Horrocks) a superstore manager who one day decides to enter the British politic arena after witnessing two politicos fighting in front of her store.  Fed up with the state of affairs in England, Mrs. Prtichard decides to run for Parliment.  At first her campaign is barebones until she meets a financial backer who'll fund her campaign with 10 million pounds.  Now with a cash influx and several key advisers, Mrs. Pritchard is ready to take on the House of Commons. But how will her family react to her decision to run?  Will her family be able to take the heavy media scrutiny?

The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard is housed in a two disc mini-box set.  All six episodes are included and they're presented in 16.9 for letterbox TVs and in Dolby Digital sound.  The video presentation is excellent with sharp picture and crisp sound.  If you love Jane Horrocks or British Dramas, then you'll enjoy this min-series. You'll be amazed by Ms. Horrocks' tour-de-force performance.

Highly recommended.",1190851200,,1151,4.917098445595855
2750272,4,B000MV8Z9K,"Not too long ago in 2005, American network television took a superb actress, Geena Davis surrounded her with a great cast which included Donald Sutherland and put her in the White House. The result was a whopping first week followed by a Nielsen plunge to the bottom of the charts. Perhaps America was not yet ready for a female President, but more likely the writing was so ham-handed that the essence of the character was lost.

Britain is used to female leaders. It had an Iron Lady, Mrs Thatcher as Prime Minister and of course it has a queen. But Britain also has the BBC which must have looked at Commander-in-Chief and sworn not to repeat its mistakes.

Mrs. Pritchard is delightful. She is a supermarket manager who breaks up a fight between too opposing male pols, and announces the she could do better than either of the brawlers. She stirs up a ground swell of female support on both sides of the aisles in Parliament and coasts to an overwhelming victory. although her first hour in office is marked with an Iranian hostage crisis, she remains devoted to the new ideas that the public demands. All the while she retains the very humanity to which the public responded so positively.

If only Geena Davis had scripts like these.",1190851200,,1239,4.648401826484018
2750273,4,B000MV8Z9K,"Ros Pritchard is a middle-class wife, mum, and superstore manager from Yorkshire who decides one day that she could do a better job representing the people than the two brawling candidates outside her store's entrance.  So she forms her own party and runs a straight-talking campaign in the general election, with no other credentials than her political naivet, a goodly amount of pluck, and a desire for change.  Before she knows it, she is swept up in a groundswell of grass-roots support, straight into 10 Downing Street.  Of course there is a lot of resentment from the old guard - how could this cheeky novice be elected Prime Minister?  She's proven her point, they say, so it's time to hand over the reins to the ""real"" politicians.  But Ros has other ideas.

What starts out as a captivating political fairy tale quickly evolves into an engrossing miniseries that deftly balances ""West Wing""-style behind-the-scenes drama with the trials of personal and family life, especially how all this affects Ros' husband and two daughters.  Mrs. Pritchard is indeed a reluctant PM at first, ducking out on her first night in London to sneak back home, and telling the Queen she's not sure she really wants the job.  (Her Majesty responds, in essence, ""You're stuck with it, honey!"")  But her personal growth in the position becomes evident as she deals with some early international crises, domestic policy wrangling, and personal issues, like the embarrassing appearance of her 19-year-old daughter's larger-than-life bare-bummed image, and her husband's shady past business dealings.  Things get to be a bit ""soapy"" as the series progresses, but the subplots also highlight the insidious nature of political scandal which can creep into the most well-meaning of administrations.

As one would expect from a BBC production, the whole miniseries is well-acted and smartly written, with just the right balance of drama, humor and pathos.  Jane Horrocks is a gem as the petite but feisty Mrs. Pritchard, and Janet McTeer brings an icy intensity to her role as Chancellor Catherine Walker.  The rest of the cast is top-notch as well.  While some of the nuances of the British electoral system and political hierarchy may be lost on American viewers, the story - full of both family drama and political intrigue - has more than enough familiar elements to make for satisfying viewing.  I highly recommend it.",1190851200,,2403,5.063451776649746

8172747,5,B000MV8Z9K,"Loved it. I just loved it, because of the acting and story telling. British political drama at its best. British political comedy at its best.

But... in the end, it's all the wrong way round. Mrs Pritchard is not the Saviour. She is a silly floor manager in a local supermarket, who gets herself naively pushed into politics--a dangerous game, here played at the highest levels--by people and forces who have their own selfish motives. Mrs. Pritchard gets just about everything wrong and then ends up in disgrace, forced to resign and hide away with her level-headed husband, who wisely had told her not to, early on, and her two moronic daughters; the older one so stupid and selfish, she's as real as they get!

Thinking back, it's hard to tell if the film's authors thought of their production as a serious statement or a hilarious political satire, staged with a good dose of the typical British dry humour, here, as dry as dust. So dry, it doesn't feel funny, until you have given it some thought, way, way later.

And, yes, the ""Green Wednesday"" is a major assault on people's liberty, the move of the Parliament to Bradford is silly falderol, and her turning away from an ally in need (the US in Iraq) is betrayal of trust--all favourite ideas of certain groups in British politics, both left and right. The film does not find fault with any of these. In the end Mrs Pritchard's fall from political power pivots on her husband's financial shenanigans 15 years earlier, fodder enough for blackmail by the very people who had elevated her in the first place. The contrast between the level-headed and professional Catherine Walker--a true politician with years or experience--and Mrs Pritchard couldn't be starker.

Snapshots of cabinet meetings and parliamentary debates have their own funny feel. Mrs Pritchard is surrounded by women. All her ministers are women. Her backbenchers are women. You can almost smell clouds of estrogen wafting over the parliament's benches and I bet her cabinet menstruates in synchrony. That group PMS at 10 Downing Street would be quite a spectacle to behold.

Well, they didn't get this far. More's the pity.",1354579200,,2149,4.876712328767123
8172748,4,B000MV8Z9K,"Though the premise appears a bit farfetched (Lincoln rose from obscurity to be President of the USA) , I did find The Amazing Mrs Pritchard most entertaining.  Jane Horrock did an excellent job with this part.  To rise from a place of obscurity to being Prime Minister of the nation of Great Britain was refreshing!  She is definitely, politically naive and way out of her depth, however, her cabinet is made up of some very fascinating characters, who are more knowledgable about politics than Mrs Pritchard. Janet McTeer turned in a first class performance. Interesting to see how she reacts to her political mistakes, how real she is when she has to make a decision where lives might be at stake. We also see in this series how Mrs. Pritchard's passion to serve her country has its' affect on her family. I do wonder, had 'she' been a 'he', would the family impact been one of the series' emphasis? As a true Anglophile, I always welcome good British programming.

8172750,5,B000MV8Z9K,"This series was so good that I hated to have it end.

At first I found the British political system somewhat confusing...but when I allowed myself to stop trying to figure it out and just go with the flow, I was okay.

Ros Pritchard, an unlikely heroine, is small town grocery store manager propelled by politics into a position for which she is highly unqualified --- but she is determined to do a good job despite the many challenges thrown her way, not the least of which is the effect on her family. Politically out of her element, she surrounds herself with a great staff of advisors. The casting of these advisors and their character development was nothing short of fantastic. All the actors in this series gave excellent performances and the story lines were interesting and engaging.

There is no ""pat"" ending. Apparently, due to ratings, the series ended too soon, but at least we are told what happened by some lines on the screen before the final credits roll. I cannot take away any stars for that....",1269129600,,1014,4.653631284916201
8172751,4,B000MV8Z9K,"I confess that I'm not normally a fan of British shows. I end up watching a lot of them since I live with someone who finds everything the BBC produces to be wonderful. I, on the other hand, tend to use the time to catch up on my magazine reading.

But this show was pretty good - hooks your interest from the start and moves forward at a brisk pace. Performances are mainly good, with excellent performances by the supporting actors. My only disappointment was that the series ends somewhat unresolved. Evidently the ratings when the show originally ran didn't support a second season, so there are several plot lines that remain hanging out there. An effort was made to tie up the loose ends with text that comes up at the end of the series that resolves (or attempts to resolve) some of the open issues, but it is not really satisfactory.

Well worth a look, especially if you can get it on sale.",1258848000,,899,4.442424242424242
8172752,4,B000MV8Z9K,"I am not someone normally inclined to watch ""political"" programs.  Yet, several years ago I found myself rather ""sucked in"" to the West Wing. The reason was that although the venue was the political arena, the issues the players confronted--with family, coworkers, friends, etc--were universal to all of us, or at least many issues were. That can also be said about this series. I really didn't know HOW to feel about this series after Episode 1. Yet, I felt compelled to watch Episode 2, and so on till the series was over.  I have a rudimentary knowledge of Britain's political process, enough to understand more about it than Ros in Episode 1!  But most viewers can relate to family issues presented here, relationship issues--between lovers, coworkers--, betrayal, the negative and positive impact of the media on our public figures and their loved ones, etc.  The show is paced well, the acting is top notch (many familiar faces here for those who watch BBC America or PBS), script blends comedy into the drama quite often.  I really ended up enjoying this. One and only negative for me--the two final screens that explain Ros's decision and its impact. When I saw the show on my local PBS station (that episode twice), I did NOT see those two final screens. I actually preferred what I THOUGHT she did--divorce the turkey!

8172753,4,B000MV8Z9K,"In hindsight The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard resonates with issues from the recent Vice-Presidential campaign of Sarah Palin -- but I'll just tell you that Mrs. Pritchard comes off looking a lot better.  A grocery store manager impulsively decides to stand for Parliament; a movement grows around her campaign, swelling her new Purple Alliance party's numbers to the point that she winds up not only in Parliament but in the office of Prime Minister.  Right away the strengths of this ""non-politician,"" the very traits that won her the election, turn out to be problematic, and as the story unfolds, all the miraculous energy of her campaign and seeming innocence of her previous life are revealed as far more complicated than it seemed intially.  In some cases, we find, bad faith was at work -- not by Mrs. Pritchard, but in the world of politics we have to hold officials responsible for the acts of their supporters.  I especially enjoy the series' portrayal of the processes through which this political movement is built.  The character of Catharine, a seasoned but unappreciated politico whom Mrs. Pritchard lures away from the opposition and makes her second in command, provides a fascinating counterpoint to the main character.  The series didn't make it past one season in England, and the producers have tacked on a couple of frames with narrative at the end to account for loose ends, but this is smart tv like we never see in the U.S.  A sobering yet charming meditation on the limits of good intentions and the real cost of human fallibility combined with the enormous power political officials have to do harm.",1236816000,,1621,4.915750915750916
