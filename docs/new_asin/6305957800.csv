Instructor Debra Minghi is called an ""alternative"" fitness professional on the cover of this vhs. Minghi's background is modern dance (she studied with Bob Fosse, toured with A Chorus Line, and choreographed routines for MTV) & she uses this experience in her 53-minute workout. I love her, she's fun, vivacious, enthusiastic, really reminds you to let go ""shake your booty"" & is a great teacher. She breaks down all the moves, going 1/2-3/4 speed lower body only, then upper body only then both, then full tempo (her normal is 50% faster then when you see those moves done on tv. This makes it easy to pick up even the first time almost, some moves more complex & take a few viewings to get it perfect, but it will be fun. She even gives great body cues & even tells you which muscles are being used. Even though you go half speed, your heart rate never has a chance to go back to normal, she keeps you moving.
The set is a club, with lights everywhere, a live dj in the back & always playing REAL songs w/real singing WOW!. There are 4 girls & 2 guys in great shape behind Debra, ""I can't hear you!!!"" all dancing. The camera moves well, is professional & with effects to make everything look even more stylish but overall keeps on Debra as good or better then most fitness dvds.
Intro - 2 min - telling you to enjoy yourself, let go, etc.
Warm-up - 9 min - This alone is wroth it.. it's fun, she gets all the good spots with the large arm movements, head turns, hip swivels, etc.
Combo #1 - 10 min - She teaches as I said above & after doing the ""routine"" once after being taught, she goes through it again slow 1x & then fast for each move again.
Combo #2 - 10 min - same thing, this one has 2 heart rate checks
Combo #3 - 13 min - slow then fast practice of the # 1 & #2 combos you learned a couple of times
Cool Down - 7 min - slower, relaxed pace stretching of hips, torso, arms, a lot of plies w/haunting female singing of a song playing that's beautiful

She calls the slow speed downtown & fast uptown, but her uptown is like 50% faster then most dancers you see even on tv, so it's a little hard to keep up & doesn't feel right to go THAT fast but she's still a lot of fun. I hope other dance instructors take a cue from her lively, in the moment, letting go style, breakdown of moves & detailed cuing.
