7741516,4,B01F1WTLDI,"Don't call me music jazz, it's social music."" Health complications has forced Miles Davis (Cheadle) into a type of forced retirement. When Rolling Stone reporter Dave Braden (McGregor) shows up to interview Miles Dave is met with resistance. He begins to see just how crazy Miles really is, and then when one of Miles' private recordings goes missing he really gets a taste of the mad genius that is one of the greatest musical minds of all time. This is a different type of bio-pic. Like the special features say this is not a cradle to the grave movie, its a heist movie involving Miles Davis. As weird as that sounds it really works and breathes new life into this genre. That said Cheadle really inhabits this person. He co-wrote, directed and starred in this and really hits it out of the park on all three. The movie flows like Miles' music. It is very loose and not structured like a normal film is but it works and you wonder why everyone can't do things like this. The movie is really good but the real reason to watch is for Don Cheadle. He gives a career defining performance and I would not be surprised to see him nominated for many awards for this movie. Overall, a movie much like Miles' music, at first you are trying to catch up to what is going on but when you finally settle in you just sit back and enjoy watching the madness unfold. I recommend this. I give this a high B.",1468800000,4,1393,4.382239382239383
7741517,4,B01F1WTLDI,"Well, Miles Davis was a cool guy. He worked as a professional Trumpet player for more then 50 years in his life before he dies in 1991.
Don Cheadle who graduated a bit earlier then me from CalArts, he seems to have so many talents that I bet that some day he will direct as well, not only act.
Now he finally made in a real cool way. Nothing really serious because he knows that I a really serious moody way he cannot win. Like other movie <BORN TO BE BLUE> he can never win over any audience. He was not born that way.
So you know what he did? He get rid of all the power and energy that is in his shoulder and just totally relaxed and made this film.

The result is a cool cool movie LET'S SAY 21 century style.

Anyone who is living in a new era will fall in love with this movie for sure.
The audience who watched this movie with me were all laughing- in a good way- and hillariously joying through the whole movie.

Although he didn't made this movie with all heart - I mean true heart that is with blood, sweat & tears which will make some audience feel bad and will make them say for sure that this movie is not good at all, I still think that this is the right way to introduce MILES DAVIS.

I lived long enough with drugs and women just because of his cool behavior, how can he be that longer survived without that attitude? Think about it.
He ain't Charile Parker.

As you know aleady the great legend who worked with him are all stars and they all are dying to work with him back then.
They are just countless.
To be said, Bill Evans, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Herlbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Keith Jarret. Quincy Johnes, George Duke, YOU NAME IT.

But his life itself was a humble one.
He was fooling around with women all his life. He was not doing good to his wife Frances and she finally leaves entirely from his life.
He even used her photo to his album cover SOMEDAY MY PRICE WILL COME.

This movie is more shine becasue of the great fun actor Ewan McGregor along with director/ actor Don Cheadle himself.
For some reason I never liked Ewan McGregor till this movie.
Because he was all covered up with beard and all, first I didn't realized that it was him and I really liked him. Then I saw him from the dark and it was him all right.
I still liked him. He was really funny and cool as Miles.
He made this movie more cool. Let's say he knows what he is doing the whole time not because he was directed by DON but naturally he knew.
Don, he was also naturally Miles himself.

The ending, you should see the ending.
After all those shooting and car chase and all that bada boom bada bam, they came back home, the Miles and the writer (EWAN) and the new trumpet rising star, Miles is putting his secret newly recorded music on the track which is the legendary album Bitches Brew  he just couldn't show it to the EVERYONE.
Then he became a recluse again for another 5 something years.
Everyone in there are exhausted knowing that he might be.
Then bam!
Next scene is him playing the most new wave sound with a big all star band in public. Let's say Rock+ Acid Jazz + Contemporary all mixed up.

This is a really cool movie that anyone will enjoy.
There are laughter, joyous match cuts with smoothen up sound bridges, great Miles' music all over. What else do ya need?",1467244800,3,3289,4.222929936305732
7741518,5,B01F1WTLDI,"Miles Ahead is a fantastic film! Don Cheadle, Emayatzy Corinealdi, and Ewan McGregor are brilliant! The music score floored me! Please, do not miss adding this film to your personal library!",1464652800,6,190,5.161290322580645
7741519,3,B01F1WTLDI,"The jury is out on this one. Im still trying to reconcile the concept. This biopic is basically a fictional story written to cast Jazz musician Miles Davis as a Dolemite or Shaft-esque character inside a gangster shoot em up picture, all the while using flashbacks of REAL historical events to set up the final payoff. I applaud the originality of the concept but theres still something about it that bothers me. Most likely its the fact that, in Don Cheadles mind, he wanted his musical idol to be more of a hero with some sort of integrity than he actually was when he was alive. So were not getting a real biopic here. Its more like fan fiction.

Set in the late seventies in the midst of Davis self-imposed seclusion from the music industry, the story finds him trying to recover homemade session tapes that were stolen from his home by greedy record executives. Cheadle wrote, directed, produced and starred in this picture. And, as always, he is brilliant! He channels Miles Davis and has the mannerisms, the voice, and the attitude down pat! He even plays the trumpet perfectly. One can tell that his research of Davis was so very thorough and meticulous. We actually SEE and HEAR Miles Davis and not Don Cheadle. Portraying Davis first wife Francis Taylor is the stunningly beautiful Emayatzy Corinealdi who is a breath of fresh air in every moment she is on screen. She is able to effectively break up the bravado and ego of this picture. Finally, yet not surprisingly, Ewan McGregor is superb as the films fictional, selfish Rolling Stone reporter. Hes a great foil for Cheadle and the two of them play off each other so well in regards to the comic timing.

Casting was great, the story was unique, but the execution was muddy. I think the fan fiction aspect, as well as the been there, done that abstract transitions from the sixties past to the seventies present made it a bit of a struggle to enjoy. But at the heart of the story, more so than Davis himself and much more than the action/drama is most definitely the music. Sketches of Spain is the emphasis throughout, and I thought it was a great decision to focus on that rather than his more notable work like Kind Of Blue or Bitches Brew.

I have a feeling Davis purists will scoff at this film, casual fans will be fascinated, and movie buffs will consider it a future classic. But once again, for me, the jury is still out on this one.",1464307200,37,2406,4.551963048498846
7741520,4,B01F1WTLDI,"""Miles Ahead"" (2015 release; 100 min.) is a movie about the jazz legend Miles Davis. As the movie opens, we are in 1980, and Miles is being interviewed, and comments to the reporter: ""Don't call my music jazz, it's social music!"". It's not long before another reporter, Rolling Stone's Dave Braden, chases down Miles, to write a ""come-back story in Miles' own words"". We then go back to the 1950s, as Miles is breaking big. One day he meets Francis, and he is immediately smitten with her. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is a labor of love AND a tour-de-force by Don Cheadle, who stars in the title role and directs, and he also co-wrote the script and co-produced. His performance as Miles Davis is spot-on, and towers above everyone else (apologies, Ewan McGregor as the Rolling Stone reporter, and sorry also, Emayatzy Corinealdi as Frances). Cheadle's brilliant performance covers up the somewhat confusing back-and-forth between the ""present"" (i.e. late 70s) and the flashbacks in the 50s. Please note that ""Miles Ahead"" is not a bio-pic (overview of Davis' life), nor is it intended as one. Cheadle (whose vision for the film was fully supported by the Miles family) simply picked two periods of Miles' life and attempts to give us a flavor of what Miles Davis the man was like. At that, I think Cheadle succeeds. If you don't care for the music of Miles Davis, by all means avoid this film, as it is chockfull of outstanding music (check out the excellent soundtrack, available here on Amazon). Last but not least, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that 95% of the movie was shot on location here in Cincinnati. Yes indeed, just like Todd Haynes' film ""Carol"" a few months ago, there are certain sections of Cincinnati that apparently easily stand in for New York back in the day.

""Miles Ahead"" finally opened a few weeks ago at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely. I doubt that this movie is going score huge at the box office, but hopefully it'll find some legs at the art-house theater circuit. If you are curious to find out more about Miles Davis, or simply want to admire the stellar performance of Don Cheadle, you cannot go wrong with ""Miles Ahead"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1462147200,24,2498,4.71395881006865
7741521,3,B01F1WTLDI,Movie was ok.  Wish it focused more on Miles' volume of work that changed the Jazz world.  Filmed in my city so i could see some of my community landmarks in it.,1495411200,2,161,4.0

7741523,3,B01F1WTLDI,"Music on soundtrack deserves ten stars, but the story is disappointing focusing on a creative genius's dark side, problems, and difficulties.
It could have shown a more balanced story of his life as it is a missed opportunity in my opinion.",1493856000,4,240,4.878048780487805
7741524,5,B01F1WTLDI,"Not remotely the movie I was expecting, but it was compelling nonetheless. Don Cheadle channels Miles Davis to an uncanny degree. The story revolves around Miles' inactive period and uses flashbacks to help propel the drama that leads to Miles' current state of mind. The one weakness I find in the movie is that the end is a bit abrupt, but I suppose that can also been seen as the old saw: ""always leave them wanting more."" I was left wanting more.",1490313600,,450,4.5

What I found was a film that makes Miles, a criminal gun slinger, woman bashing appalling human being.
I know he had a few issues with drugs and had relationship breakdowns but this movie makes him look like a terrible person.
As a story and movie it's not terrible but if your looking for a true story about Miles Davis this is not the one to watch.

7741529,4,B01F1WTLDI,"I never knew what Miles Davis was like as a person.  I never watched any interviews with the man, or any documentaries for that matter.  I just know and love the guy's music.  A creative genius is one way to describe him, but taking jazz to a whole new level and reinventing the way it can be played puts him in a whole other ballpark.  With that said, Miles Ahead is a fake/fictional attempt to show people what Miles was doing from 1975-onward.  I feel the movie would probably have been better off focusing on the real events Miles had to experience for one thing, but also focusing on the early days of Miles career.  Making a story begin right after his Agharta album is odd for sure.

In Miles Ahead, Miles Davis is portrayed as someone who's contractually obligated to release music for his record company, but he's surrounded by shady business people who make decisions for him.  He takes exception to it of course.  Don Cheadle does a tremendous job portraying Miles Davis.  He was perfect for the role.  Miles was one angry man according to Don's portrayal.  Sometimes the anger is borderline funny, such as when Miles insists on getting revenge with his record company but the operator on the phone says they're not available until after the holiday (or the weekend, I forget) or when he's impatiently waiting in one scene, an angry man walks by getting smart with Miles and Miles blurts out ""I'm the one waiting"" (F words follow!)

Miles was apparently a very obnoxious man who loved to say the F word according to this movie, along with someone who sat around smoking, drinking and listening to the radio (and even calling them on the phone to correct their mistakes- apparently Miles didn't like when people referred to his Kind of Blue album as a timeless masterpiece).  Miles seemed to think the music he recorded long ago was meant to be forgotten (if not forgotten, not treasured so fondly).  He also had hip replacement surgery which was real, and the stiffness/discomfort making it hard for Miles to run plays a role in this movie.  More on that later.

The story is that a Scottish writer played by Ewan McGregor from Rolling Stone magazine drops by.  Miles basically tells him to go away.  Hilarious how he's able to sneak into Miles house while accidentally locking Miles outside during a conflict!  The man uses this opportunity to snoop around the house and explore Miles living conditions ignoring Miles pounding on the door to let him in.  Anyway after Ewan's almost shot, they calm down enough for Ewan to convince Miles to head to the downtown record company and meet up with executives so Miles can return to the studio to make a new album.  This is when Keith Stanfield's character is introduced.  He's a young kid and according to the executives, the next big jazz player.  He's quiet in this scene but more important later on.

When things go sour with the executives (and I'm pretty sure Miles shooting a gun at one of those shady executives would have resulted in many years behind jail, so the fictional elements are apparent early!) Miles and Ewan find themselves getting involved with drugs in some guy's apartment.  A strange story change there, but it's done for the purpose of Miles seeing the Filles De Kilimanjaro album, which features his wife Betty Mabry on the cover (played by Emayatzy Corinealdi who, in my opinion, was perfect for the role in both her demeanor and appearance).

The main chunk of the story is that when Miles returns home he finds a young woman has thrown a party for herself in Miles house, and invited a bunch of people over.  Miles gets upset of course.  Who wouldn't get upset?  He didn't approve of this!  Or did he?  It sounds like he did approve but there was a misunderstanding on which day of the week the party should have happened.  Anyway the crooks from the record company drop by including Keith Stanfield. When Miles has trouble closing a drawer in an attempt to hide a tape he doesn't want the record company to have (since they'll release it to the public) they ultimately steal it while Miles is in the music room with Ewan.

Sometime after this, we see high octane shooting scenes with Miles and Ewan driving around and shooting at the record company down the streets of New York.  Yes that's right- Miles was a shooter according to this movie, haha.  Not to mention someone who was heavily addicted to drugs and needed a quick fix.  And later Miles runs towards the executives with a bad hip (and bad intentions).  This almost looks like a mockery of his real hip issue if you ask me.  A low blow there.  This is when I knew the movie had crossed the line into complete fiction.  I would have definitely heard about all this senseless shooting during my Miles Davis phase and all the reading I did on the man.  Even Keith's character comes along, but not before Miles and Ewan get into a brief conflict with the guy since for a little while Keith had possession of the tape and ran away with it.  The part with Keith is another exaggerated gun scene.  Hilarious how Ewan thinks he can fight Keith based on the little punching bag scene with Miles Davis earlier!

This movie is fun to watch, but it's impossible to know which parts are fiction and which parts really happened so don't take it seriously.  I think we can conclude the relationship with Betty Mabry is realistic since she *was* his real wife.  Throughout the movie we constantly see flashbacks of a young Miles Davis as he reflects on his early jazz days with Betty.  The times he'd defend Betty against white judges who'd criticize her, the times he would be away and call her on the phone, and even an argument that apparently occurred while Miles was taking a bath (he wanted Betty to give up her dancing career to spend time with Miles with promises she'd be financially set for the rest of her life.  She walks away from the bathroom angry but ultimately agrees to it).

In one scene at a restaurant, a woman approaches Miles and Betty gets offended.  She gives Miles the meanest look ever!  In the next scene Miles is simply smoking a cigarette outside and a cop tells him to move along.  He refuses, the cop gets violent and soon Miles is beaten and arrested.  I know Miles was a victim of racism, so it's probably true he was beat on by whites and/or cops.  Not sure if it happened *this* way though, or if this scene is simply more fiction.  This is why adding fictional elements was a really bad idea.  Because those of us curious about the truth sit here confused.  We want to know what really happened concerning a legendary jazz player.

Now did Miles really have a conversation with a Scottish writer from Rolling Stone?  Who knows, but they hit off enough of a relationship that Miles allows the guy to enter his music room during the party.  Miles had a punching bag apparently and liked to use it often.  Like I mention above, we even see Miles teaching Ewan how to fight.  Did this stuff really happen?  Who knows.  I imagine Miles probably felt the need to toughen up as a way to deal with the racial tension going on in his life, so this might be believable.  But then again I would have figured someone with his legendary status would be living in a place far away from the crime and violence so toughening up probably wasn't even necessary.  The block he was living on looks pretty brutal in this film compared to the nice home he was living in.

And about that tape?  Well this is a SPOILER but after retrieving it, it turns out Miles never even played trumpet on it (he played the organ instead) so it would have been meaningless to the record company.  All those shooting scenes were for nothing.  The music that plays throughout the movie is really good.  Just brief snippets of his trumpet work from the classic years in the 60's, 70's and 80's.  The comeback does eventually happen and it's a nice moment of storytelling.  Finally Miles Davis decides not to be so obnoxious and actually allows a concert to happen!  Yes!  He hardly ever smiles in the movie which is odd.  Maybe he really was ticked off all the time.  The moments Miles Ahead flashes back to his younger years and performs in early jazz concerts are good moments too.

Worth watching, but don't take the story seriously unless you can pick out the fictional stuff from the facts.  The more I think about it however, the more I think this movie is 80% fiction.  Too many things just don't add up.  I'd like to think the parts with Betty Mabry are the most realistic and perhaps Miles really did sit around smoking and drinking after his mid 70's break but everything else seems too far-fetched to me, especially everything involving the record company executives.  That stuff is pure action movie nonsense.",1487894400,,8748,4.569408740359897

7741531,1,B01F1WTLDI,"While Cheadle looks the part and plays it well, his own instrumentation, or simulations thereof, is/are weak.  His efforts did nothing to save the controversial trumpeter's image.  The closing segment featuring him playing with Herbie Hancock and other various members from Miles' past ensembles, is a vanity piece that should have been suppressed along with the preceding ninety-five minutes of offal.
Miles Ahead is an idiotic fiction, taking what was a very interesting period of Miles Davis' life and turning it into an insipid blaxploitation-type farce.
I had to watch the film in segments, as the accumulating vexation it induced compelled me to turn bitterly away.
Watched segmentally or at one sitting matters little, however; this is memorable only for its ill-conceived fatuousness.",1487289600,,792,5.430894308943089

7741546,3,B01F1WTLDI,"Writer/Director Don Cheadle has said that Miles Ahead is not a bio-pic. He didn't want to do a traditional movie and under the Miles Davis mantra of don't look back  don't do the last thing, Cheadle wrote, produced, and starred in this fictitious story. With permission from the Miles family, Cheadle stated  as he is quoted from the DVD extras  . . . we gave ourselves permission . . . to externalize what we imagined. Cheadle may have single-handedly created a new film genre: bio-fiction. To me, if a person merits the time and money to have a film made about their life, why not tell it the way it happened? Whats wrong with enlightening the world about a person using the actual events in that persons life?  Whats next: Elvis playing an undercover narcotics officer? Abraham Lincoln as a vampire slayer? I suppose such movies could be entertaining, as was this one, but what does this movie do to shed light on Davis career? What does this add to his legacy?

On the positive side, Don Cheadle obviously did his homework regarding the portrayal of Davis. His respect for the music even shows by the preparation and playing of the trumpet. Himself a sax player, at least he knew trumpet players would be watching for the right technique and fingerings. Cheadle also assembled a very talent cast, including Ewan McGregor, Emayatzy Corinealdi, Lakeith Lee Stanfield, and Michael Stuhlbarg.

At several levels, this movie is a quality production and entertaining. On the other hand, the plot is not particularly original and would not be as interesting and novel without the character of Miles Davis.

This is an art film, not a documentary, so do not be misled. It is an artistic take on a day in the life of Miles Davis; if you are looking for a biopic of this iconic musician, this is not it. This movie is to film what Mirot is to painting -- splashes of intense color and sound and motion and dialogue splashed onto a fictional background of one day in time. The soundtrack includes recordings of some of his best work, but the big disappointment is that none of the songs go full length, which for me was a big disappointment. Also, one must be familiar with Miles' work to identify the pieces.
A side note to Amazon, Why on earth do you have Michael Stuhlbarg as the star of this film, when it was written, directed, produced, and stars Don Cheadle? Is this some sort of racist discrediting of Cheadle? This is an error that must be corrected.",1476316800,,981,4.251336898395722

7741580,5,B01F1WTLDI,Excellent concept to completion. Slick editing and awesome job capturing the essence of the era. Cheadle did great! Especially considering the time involved and the hurdles he had to maneuver to bring a Miles Davis story to the big screen. This was not a biop (so 'purist' can save their criticism) but a thoroughly entertaining version of the man and the myth of Miles Davis.,1471824000,2,376,4.8
7741581,3,B01F1WTLDI,"Cheadle deserves praise for his attention to detail in portraying Miles--the vocal inflections, the facial expressions, even the fact that his fingering on the trumpet tracks the music. And there are a lot of small details that he gets right as well, including the fact that a lot of Miles' dialogue in the film consists of actual quotes. But then you have the action movie/buddy movie/blaxploitation part of the film that looks like a concession to the Hollywood money men. The sleazy promoter character who steals the tape was laughably cliche, the chase scenes and the final recovery of the tape were utterly standard and predictable and I found myself getting pretty bored about midway through the film. I have no problem with Cheadle not attempting a rigidly historical portrayal of Miles along the lines of ""Ray"" or ""Get On Up"". I've seen his approach described as ""impressionistic"". That's fine, I'm not a purist who's going to pick at the film's every little departure from ""fact"", but I don't spend money on action buddy films, either. It's a shame that Cheadle spent so much time and effort studying Miles only to weirdly use his life as a take-off point for an empty genre like this.",1471651200,2,1194,4.829268292682927

7741583,4,B01F1WTLDI,"After I saw this film in the theaters, I came out saying there are way too many errors in Miles Davs life. I also thought of it as a vanity project for Don Cheadle, who, not only co-wrote the script, co-produced the film, directed the film and cast himself in the leading role.  But, now that Ive watched DVD and seen the two special bonus features  I have a new view on the film and I actually like it better.

If youve read my other Amazon reviews you would know that I absolutely hate spoilers in a review (particularly with mysteries). But this is the rare case where you need to know things revealed in the bonus features before you watch the film. No, I don't encourage you to WATCH them. There are scenes included that would destroy your enjoyment. These are the things you DO need to know:

As Cheadle says in the 20 minute making of featurette:
1. This is NOT a Biopic
2. I wanted to make a heist film starring Miles Davis
3. We were so tight on our budget that we only shot 110 minutes of film and the final edited film runs 100 minutes

The film focuses on the five years that Davis did NOT touch his trumpet and what MIGHT have happened. The film is co-produced by both Davis son and nephew. Both  as well as co-star Ewan McGregor (who also self-directed his own 2016 film), and other cast members are in the making of bonus. Four of them re-appear in the Q&A session from the screening at Sundance. This runs 20 minutes (though the first three  which should have been deleted  have Cheadle thanking many backers and his agent).

And, if you STILL want to hear more from Cheadle, there is the full-length commentary (which I have not listened to).

Cheadle does a more than creditable job in the role and gets Davis mannerisms and unique voice down pat. If you have an interest in Davis and know his music, I think youll like the film (knowing full-well that its written as fiction). If you don't know Davis music (Ill then assume you are under 40), the sounds you hear may encourage you to seek out his recordings.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7741587,4,B01F1WTLDI,"As a fan of Miles Davis I was anxious to see this biopic, which I was hoping would give me more insight into his persona as well as his music.  The project was a labor of love of its first time director and co-writer, Don Cheadle who also plays Davis.  Rather than provide a traditional, linear portrait, Cheadle focuses on 2 sections of Daviss life.

The film is set in the late 70s when Davis has gone into semi-seclusion in New York (filmed mostly in Cincinnati).  Hes drinking a lot and does plenty of cocaine.  Hes also running out of money and is late delivering new material to his record label (Columbia).  The film often jumps back to another period (late 50s, early 60s) when Davis meets the love of his life, Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi, TVs Hand of God).  Holding the pieces together and navigating the story is Dave Braden (Ewan McGregor) who claims to be a writer for Rolling Stone and wants an interview.

Braden is a totally fictional character as is the caper inserted into the film about Daviss new music being stolen by Harper (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his wannabe horn player, Junior (Keith Stanfield).  This section of the film is little more than a cat and mouse game of chasing the reel-to-reel tape canister containing the music.  It does show how unhinged Davis was at this point in his life.  Cheadle handles his directing and acting duties with great precision.  He seems to have a handle on what Davis must have been like.  His explosive temper, sometimes offset by his love of Frances, a professional dancer.  Cheadle looks and sounds like Davis.

There is also plenty of musical love with plenty of chatter about my favorite Davis album, Sketches of Spain. The film does come up a bit short on the creative effort however, with only one significant effort of collaboration.  So for me, it is a mixed bag.  The unconventional story telling might have been just what Miles would have wanted, but it left me wanting.  Still the performance of Cheadle make the film worthwhile.

The Blu ray package delivers the transfer with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The movie appears to have been shot mostly on film and it looks very good on disc.  Just the right amount of grain still allow a nice detail to the look.  Close-ups provide good examples, with skin blemishes, hair, etc.  Good black levels and proper hues provide an exemplary picture.  The audio come by way of a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  It is what you would expect of a first class transfer.  The music is perfectly placed and the dialog comes through clear throughout.  Atmospheric elements are introduced through the surround speakers including scenes of gunfire (yeah, Miles liked to shoot his gun).  Subtitles are available in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin, Thai and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary track with Cheadle and co-writer Steve Baigelman, The Truth: Becoming Miles Davis, a Q & A at the Sundance Film Festival, and a trailer.",1471132800,4,2976,4.76908023483366
7741588,5,B01F1WTLDI,"Don Cheadle and a community of artists made a film the way they imagined Miles Davis would have, with attitude and always looking forward. Not your Miles Davis biopic (a film we also need) you are drawn in to a world informed by his life, that never happened. It works for me as a Jazz Film, or perhaps I should say a Social Music Film. (See Donald Bogle's essay in the ""Mo Better Blues"" companion book to Spike Lee's film - I could not articulate why so few Jazz Films worked until he laid it out plainly for me.)",1470960000,5,514,4.202020202020202
7741589,4,B01F1WTLDI,"I would like to preface my review by saying that I'm not a jazz fan and I know little about Miles Davis.  By chance I saw him at a free outdoor event on the Fourth of July in Philly in 1983 at the behest of an art student friend of mine.  My only recollection is Davis played the entire show with his back to the audience and his music didn't move me.  That said I have a myriad of impressions about this film.  This is a case of Don Cheadle putting everything on the line in making this film with little to gain and everything to lose.  This is a gutsy film that takes chances and dares the audience to indulge its unique rhythms.  As an actor there aren't enough superlatives for Cheadle.  He inhabits the spirit of Davis in all his spit, attitude, and vitriol.  This isn't so much an artist demanding your affection but who damn well expects your respect.  As a director Cheadle is very ambitious cascading the film with sights and sounds that stays with you long after its over.  Story wise it's a little dicey.  I can appreciate that Cheadle has structured his story in an unconventional way relying on the present, in this case New York circa 1980, flashing back in unforeseen ways.  What I didn't get was the subplot involving stolen master tapes that would be more at home in a Tarantino picture.  This may be me but the music in the film didn't resonate.  Regardless this is an audacious effort whose spirit of reckless abandon would surely gain the approval of its subject matter.  Reminded me of a jazz version of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"".  An unconventional film not likely to garner the attention of the awards givers at the end of the year.",1470787200,,1662,4.417763157894737

7741591,4,B01F1WTLDI,"I didn't really know a lot about this movie going into watching it and while I did enjoy it mostly, it's not completely factual which was a bit of a let down.

The more I watched the film, the more it made me think of Oliver Stone's interpretation of Jim Morrison from his film The Doors. (For those who don't know, that's also a movie with a lot of factual inaccuracies.) While the flashbacks are based on truth, what's going on in the present is fictional...example: Ewan McGregor's character is a completely made up person.

It definitely was entertaining as a movie and kind of an interesting way to tell some of the events of Miles Davis throughout his life. While I did enjoy the film itself I couldn't help but think how much better it could have been if they had done more about his life and less with the added in story.

While I don't regret watching this, I wish I would have known more about it before watching. I enjoyed it as a film, but it just made me want to watch a documentary about Miles afterwards. If that was the point then mission accomplished. For anyone who knows nothing about Miles Davis I would steer clear of this as an intro as the mixing of truth and fiction would be confusing, but if you're in for a good flick to watch that will keep your interest the entire time...check this out.",1470441600,,1316,4.363265306122449
7741592,4,B01F1WTLDI,"More drama than Jazz but done well from first time Director,Don Cheadle. Cheadle did such a great acting job that I forgot that he didn't look like Miles. And the excellent actress, Emayatzy Corinealdi DID look like Frances,Mile's Wife. The other actor's were also excellent. Miles was a cranky contrary guy to put it nice. In 1960 at an afternoon session (I was there) at the Black Hawk night club in San Francisco which featured, Miles,Trane,Cannonball,Kelly,Chambers and Jimmy Cobb (Still living) at break time Miles told my friend,""Get out of my way"" But here it's much worse,much,much worse. He even mentioned that there are 2 sides to him. I like the trumpet side of his personality better than that other one.
There's lotta ass kissing for this bastard because of his talent. Ton's of flashbacks in this flick. Extra's; Commentary over the film,Interview's,Preview's of the film +other films.

7741593,5,B01F1WTLDI,"Just finished watching ""Miles Ahead"" last night. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for fans of Miles Davis and jazz fans in general. HARD to believe this is Cheadle's first time behind the lens. He's obviously had opportunities with his cable series ""House of Lies.""
While not a linear biopic taking us from birth to death, the film nevertheless scores through liberal use of flashbacks to tell, at it's core, a story of love found, and ultimately lost, against the backdrop of Miles self-imposed exile of the seventies, contrasted with arguably Miles most fertile musical period between his first and second great quintets. Yes, there are some fictional characters that help to advance the story, but if you are a fan of biopics, then you know this cinematic device is nothing new.
The film is a tight 100 minutes, which allows us to really focus on four characters, young phenom Junior(newcomer LaKeith Lee ""Keith"" Stanfield) freelance reporter Dave Braden(a terrific Ewan McGregor, Miles first wife Frances Taylor(an enchanting Emayatzy Corinealdi). All acquit themselves quite well. McGregor, a top billing star in his own right, handles supporting duties well, as he's often shown he can do, and Corinealdi and Stanfield are both future stars.

But make no mistake, Don Cheadle gives arguably the greatest performance of his career here, and if you know Cheadle's filmography, then you know that's saying something. He carries the film. Rarely is he not onscreen, and you can tell the man has spent years with Davis' family, studying film, listening to the music and most impressively, playing the trumpet. He breathes Miles Davis. Don't be surprised if you have moments where you forget that "" it's Don Cheadle playing Miles Davis.""

An enthusiastic five stars.",1470182400,4,1752,5.143859649122807
7741594,5,B01F1WTLDI,"Great Movie, I saw this in the theatre originally and was presently surprised with the direction Don Cheadle took it. Instead of some boring movie about the life of Miles Davis, Don Cheadle went for more of a Pulp Fiction type feel which was a pleasant a surprise. A lot of people wanted more of a movie like Ray(Jamie Foxx) or a documentary. For those folks I recommend Ken Burns Jazz,Miles Electric: A Different Kind of Blue and other documentaries on Miles. This is a gritty flick with Miles Davis as the anti-hero. Very different and creative! Not the same old boring formula which if you know anything about Miles Davis the Musician it fits perfect!!!! Miles broke the mold in Jazz and Don Cheadle did it with this movie!! 5 stars and a ba-da-dwee-owwwe(jazz ending).",1469664000,3,772,4.6838235294117645

This was a real labor of love for Don who not only stars but directed (his first time), plus he co-worker it. I think he did a great job all the way around. It kind of is a day in the life.

7741596,3,B01F1WTLDI,"I pre-purchased this DVD and just picked it up today. I have been a fan of Miles Davis for many years.  However, I only saw him play once in about 1975 out in Stoney Brooke University.  That night he opened for Herbie Hancock.  When I saw Miles that night, it was a good show, but I got an impression that night of how chaotic Miles was.  He was shouting at the stage hands, and band members while on stage. Not too many things seemed to please him, and all the while he was contributing to that chaotic performance.  I mention this because with such a character as Miles was, I have to question if it was correct to have this movie storie line have so many backwards and forwards time adjustments as this movie has.  It also seems like the movie goes from one scene to the next in either the 50's or the 70's, only to stop at either some act of violence or sex while in the background the music of Miles Davis is playing. The life of Miles Davis could have been told in a movie in such a way that would not be as painful for the viewer to watch.

Paul McCartney used the exact same plot in, ""Give My Regards To Broadstreet,"" and we know how that turned out. Eastwood's, ""Bird,"" was deadly dull, but I would have preferred Don Cheadle had taken a similar approach to his Miles biopic.",1469491200,4,434,4.723684210526316
7741598,2,B01F1WTLDI,"The only reason why I gave this two stars instead of one is because of Don Cheadle's acting performance, which is excellent. His performance as a director though... not so much.

Miles Davis is my favorite musician of all time and I've been waiting forever for Hollywood to make a movie about him. Now they have, and the film is supremely disappointing. Why? Mostly because of questionable creative decisions. Why make a movie about the greatest musical genius of the 20th century that focuses on his LOWEST point? The film doesn't touch on how Miles was singlehandedly responsible for 3 or 4 paradigm shifts in music across his career, how he once locked himself in a room at his parents' house in St. Louis to detox from heroin, or how he once performed in front of 600,000 people at the Isle of Wight festival. Younger people who know nothing about Miles Davis will watch this film and think he's a loser and a thug.

If you're interested in Miles I would recommend the excellent documentary Miles Electric: A Different Kind of Blue rather than this misguided piece of garbage.",1469318400,3,1080,4.708994708994709

Miles wasn't a traditional human being. There is literally no point in trying to dissect Miles' life story in order to understand the music. First, I think the music can be appreciated, but I don't think there's a person walking this planet who can ""articulate"" what Miles was all about, because he steadfastly rejected that notion. Instead, you get the highly volatile and conflicted Miles, on the verge of coming out of his self-imposed ""retirement,"" and it's wrapped in a soundtrack that is sublime. Don fought for the movie, and it was worth fighting for. If you know Miles via ""Kind of Blue,"" this might not be the movie for you. But if you know that album AND ""Pangaea,"" ""Agharta,"" ""Dark Magus"" and all of the music in between, you'll get it. My highest recommendation because of what the movie is (an off-the wall, almost Cinma vrit look at a genius), as well as what it isn't (a shiny, superficial, feel-good story of redemption blah blah blah).",1532649600,,1103,4.604060913705584
