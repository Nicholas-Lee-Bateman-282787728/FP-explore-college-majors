6071884,5,B00GD7UMDO,"Arrived on time and I enjoy the series. I WAS AFRAID I WOULD HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME WATCHING HIM AS ANYONE BUT MORSE'S SIDEKICK, HE;S A GREAT ACTOR.  I'M BUY SERIES TWO IF THERE IS ONE",1396396800,,183,4.083333333333333

6071886,4,B00GD7UMDO,"I enjoyed the series but have only watched two of the four episodes. I found it to be a little slow and at times drawn out with a predictable plot. The humor was great, and the actors (especially Kevin Whately) absolutely made the story entertaining. I enjoyed the dilemma of the ex wife and the tantalizing relationship with other woman (Gabby) quite entertaining as a prevalent background in all episodes. Overall four and a half stars. As with all acorn productions, it appears that a great deal of expense and attention to detail was put into the production. Hope to get to disc two soon. I believe this will be the first of a long and successful series.",1394496000,4,658,4.584745762711864

6071888,1,B00GD7UMDO,"Bought this in DVD mode and never finished the first disk. Didn't even donate to library. When I realized who the main actor was it didn't seem like the right part for him. Seen him in others and liked them. If I had recognized his face before I bought it I would have know he would never be good in this. Also seemed to be trying to look/seem younger. Blah, awful some actors should stick to what they do well",1392854400,4,410,4.1375
6071889,5,B00GD7UMDO,"We are great fans of Kevin Whatley in both the Inspector Morse and the Inspector Lewis series, so it is interesting and entertaining  to see him in another series role.  This series is from 1997 in a time between ""Morse"" and ""Lewis"" and is a different kind of crime detection story with a considerably less than perfect main character.  While Whatley's character Jimmy Griffin is an ex-detective, he is about as far from Lewis as a man could get,  except that he is excellent at his job uncovering insurance fraud.  His personal life is a mess, and he is always just about to get himself sorted out, but the demands of his job leave him little time to work on changing.  He has an exasperated ex-wife, two great children and he tries to do the right thing by them.  Complicating matters, his boss is his ex-mistress and he has a co-worker with the knack of excessively poor judgment that puts the love triangle without love as Griffin calls it,  together at the worst possible times.  This is mature television with interesting involving stories and characters, some brief nudity, and rough language.",1392076800,6,1100,4.717277486910994
6071890,1,B00GD7UMDO,"I am 15 minutes into the first scene and already I agree with the second, long, reviewer that it is way below par. I'm already reaching for my cell phone game.
I checked and found out it was produced in 1997. If I had known I wouldn't have bought it. Amazon lied; should have given the original date, not 'released in 2014'. And should not have touted it on my page.",1391472000,10,366,4.169014084507042
6071891,3,B00GD7UMDO,"After leaving the police force, Jimmy Griffin (Kevin Whately) is forced to scramble for a job to provide support for his ex-wife Sally (Annette Ekblom, Fever Pitch) and their kids. Jimmy and his private investigation teamVinnie (show scripter Al Ashton, A Fish Called Wanda) and Harriet (Sarah-Jane Potts, Kinky Boots)start investigating claims for a local insurance firm, which puts him in back in contact with Gabby (Michelle Fairley, Game of Thrones), whose affair with Jimmy broke up the man's marriage. Acting as an insurance investigator, Jimmy soon learns, has quite a bit of overlap with to the life of a cop in the danger department.

The Broker's Man originally aired its episodes in two 50-minute blocks. Series 1 assembles the episodes into three movie-length wholes:

""Double Dutch"" (96 minutes)When Dutch criminals steal a ton of digital audio tapes from a warehouse, Jimmy is hired to investigate insurance fraud. Betrayal and murder soon follow.

""Dangerous Bends"" (94 minutes)Jimmy investigates the circumstances surround a deadly accident, which leads to the world of illegal dirtbike racing. He enlists his team to help figure out if the claims against a water treatment plant have any merit.

""Siege"" (96 minutes)During a getaway designed to mend the soured relationship to his family, Jimmy struggles to stop a ring of car thieves and a deranged veteran of the Falklands War.

The notion of insurance investigators taking on mysteries is a novel enough idea, especially with a likeable actor like Kevin Whately in the lead. But it only took about twenty minutes for me to realize that, despite the good stuff going for it, The Broker's Man was really just a boring procedural in a different package.

In each of the three episodes, Jimmy Griffin and his team get hired to look into possibly fraudulent insurance claims that quickly dissolve into chase scenes or gunplay. Good think Jimmy is an ex-cop. The episodes usually find a way to tie all of the cases together and wrap them up neatly, too. Some of the plotting is deftthe subplot in ""Dangerous Bends"" involving water contamination, for instance, unfolded quite nicely (and fit the show's premise to boot). But otherwise, The Broker's Man suffers greatly when it plods along and takes the most obvious route possible to get somewhere.

Jimmy is surrounded by supporting characters with no depth, from his vanilla team to the one-note insurance company people who serve as this show's police commander. Even Michelle Fairley's Gabby does do much besides pine after Jimmy and make a few flirtatious remarks per scene. The Griffin family fairs a bit better, thankfully, and the drama surrounding Jimmy and Sally's marriage is maybe more captivating than the actual mystery stuff. (Though the number of awkward comic moments the show tries to wring out of Jimmy's old affair with Gabby is cringe-worthy.) It helps that Whately has such a friendly and genial presence on the screen, and he has enough dorky charisma to wipe away some of the show's sins. Only some.

Acorn Media's two-disc set of The Broker's Man: Series 1 is as threadbare as it gets. The 1.55:1 letterbox presentation is subparthe picture quality is anything but sharp, with several nighttime scenes looking especially bad. (Worth noting: the picture is windowboxed on HD televisions.) The Dolby Digital stereo track fares betters with a quite average sound quality, though the super sexy saxophone music that dominates the score tends to drown out some of the softer dialogue from time to time. If you were hoping for extras, tough luck.

6071892,5,B00GD7UMDO,"Insurance companies benefit from this ex-cop digging into questionable claims. Jimmy Griffin Investigations handles fraud. But the boss fails miserably at family relations. He's a brave investigator who gets the tough jobs done. He's also divorced but inwardly wants a second chance with his ex. She can't forget the ""other woman.""
You get suspense, mystery and humor amid tons of Brit drama. It's a unique crime drama approach. It works as believable.

Cast is led by Jimmy (Kevin Whately -Inspector LEWIS; Insp Morse). Ex is Sally (Annette Ekblom -Holby City) with the Ins/mistress connection being Gabby (Michelle Fairley), a pair of beauties. Jimmy's office staff is bubbly Harriet (Sarah-Jane Potts) and fat Vinny (Al Ashton) who also co-writes the 3 episodes. Toss in guest-stars creating fine performance all-round.

SDH SUBTITLES for all feature-length episodes
1- Double Dutch: A million-$ shipping container theft gets `Godzilla' (Peter Firth `MI-5') hiring Jimmy. A late 90's period, VHS tapes involved. Jimmy, desperate for cash, is behind on child-care. A Dutch crime ring may be behind murders as well as bin theft. Post divorce relations conflict. Conspiracy big enough to baffle the best mystery viewer's mind. Claudette (Jill Baker) continues in all episodes.

2- Dangerous Bends: Auto/cycle impact leaves a death and injured who leaves the accident scene. This insurance case and a second (water plant accident) keep Jimmy hopping 2 directions. Danger develops as clues begin to reveal truth. And constantly, Jimmy's personal life tracks like a train wreck.

3- Siege: Sally & Jimmy relationship mends a bit. Hope? Stolen weapon investigation offers a vacation potential. With Sally & kids? With a past mistress nearby? Will this guy never learn? Jimmy takes on another local case unapproved by Sally. Will he put his kids in harms way? 2 Downton Abbey actors guest star: Michael Cochrane & David Robb.  A 2-second nude man's backside is a comic flash.

Good enough I'm hoping for a second DVD series someday in the future.",1389398400,14,2041,5.245398773006135
6071893,3,B00GD7UMDO,"Story lines are winey, with Jim and his wife fighting all the time and trouble with his daughter, which is not relative to the show and not up to Detective Lewis standards. I gave it three stars only because I like Kevin Whately.",1435017600,,229,4.348837209302325

6071905,5,B00GD7UMDO,"this show starts off slow. And each episode is basically a minimovie.  However , once it gets rolling the show works better. Kevin W.  does a great job as investigator for a insurance company.  Some of the negative reviews on this site are basically this "" I can't relate to him as any other role than lewis.'  which is absurd. This character is NOT lewis. he's got a broken family life due to his cheating on his wife and his constantly being on the job.  This show was made in 1997, so obviously it Is from that era which is fine.  The first episode takes a while to get cooking , but it does and  you get a good story about blackmail and such.  The show looks very good on dvd , just like new.  It's a good thing they dug this up!. Now we can watch this interesting detective show from the late 90's at our own leisure.  Back then you would have had to tape it. If It were even shown in the states that is.  there are no extras on this dvd though",1406246400,2,949,4.048387096774194

He is not limited to murder and I like that.  The life of an underdog continues, but he keeps the interest of the viewer because he can think out of the box.",1403481600,3,316,4.0
6071908,5,B00GD7UMDO,"I LIKE KEVIN WHATLEY, LOVED HIM IN INSPECTOR MORSE.  REALLY ENJOYED THIS SERIES, CURRENTLY WATCHING SERIES 2 (BETTER THAN SERIES 1)  ONLINE FROM ACORNTV.",1402185600,,153,5.333333333333333
6071909,4,B00GD7UMDO,"In THE BROKER'S MAN, Series One, (1997-98), a British television series, the likeable actor Kevin Whately (INSPECTOR MORSE, INSPECTOR LEWIS), stars in the title role, as Jimmy Griffin.  This British mystery/ crime drama presents the actor as an ex-cop, (well, did you ever), turned insurance investigator.  He's still relying on his bag of tricks from his years on the job: cunning and insight, an ability to think on his feet, the ability to remain cool under fire.  So, no wonder he always succeeds in this winning TV series. This boxed DVD set of two discs features three feature length mysteries and runs approximately 288 minutes.  There is a modest amount of coarse language and nudity. And thank goodness, and more to the point, thank you RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, it's got subtitles, as these transatlantic ears and eyes guess it's set and filmed in the British Midlands.

A strong cast of actors plays some compelling characters in this entertainment.  Annette Ekbom, (HOLBY CITY), plays Sally, Griffin's estranged wife.  She has divorced him, as he was having an affair with his co-worker Gabby Rodwell, played by Michelle Fairley, the beloved Caitlin Stark of GAME OF THRONES.  Unfortunately, even as Griffin is struggling to rebuild his family and keep them safe from the perils his work engenders, he's still flirting with all the pretty girls.  Other well-known guest stars include Al Hunter Ashton, (LONDON'S BURNING)who co-wrote the script; PETER FIRTH, (MI-5); Sarah Jane Potts, (FELICITY); John McEnery, (GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING), and Shirley Stelfox, the first Rose in the beloved Britcom KEEPING UP APPEARANCES.  Michael Cochrane and David Robb, two Downton Abbey actors, also guest star.  And I'd swear I saw the hunky Idris Elba, (LUTHER) in an uncredited, but named, small speaking part.

The episodes are:

Double Dutch.  A shipping container holding  millions in digital audio tapes is stolen by a murderous Dutch crime ring, and Griffin's on the case to investigate possible insurance fraud.  He finds across the North Sea, entangled with the violent crime ring.

Dangerous Bends.  An accident on a village road.  Motorcycle and car collide.  The car's driver is killed.  The guilty motorcyclist limps away from the scene; Jimmy gets involved in the world of illegal dirt bike racing.  The investigator's looking into the hit-run, but must also take on a lucrative water treatment malfunction case.  Not easy juggling the two.

Siege.  As Jimmy is finally able to start repairing his relationships with Sally and his children, he takes them on a modest family vacation.  But a small firearms theft falls in his lap, despite his best efforts to enjoy a real holiday with his reuniting family.  He's trying to keep it secret from Sally.  Hard to do as the man at the center of the case, a veteran of the brief Falkland Islands war, is dangerous and volatile.

We found the first two episodes to be the strongest and most engrossing.  However, no matter how you cut it, this is an enjoyable show that mixes crime with humor, and manages to come up with a new twist on the ever popular British police procedural.  It's carried ably by the popular Whately and its strong cast. Worth a look any day, as it's available in streaming format.",1400544000,6,3259,4.990723562152134

6071911,3,B00GD7UMDO,Evidently the makers of this show were trying to use Kevin Whately's popularity from Inspector Morse. However the series is dragged down by a domestic subplot and the fact that he is not a cop.,1398384000,3,193,4.542857142857143
6071912,4,B00GD7UMDO,"When I ordered this series I was afraid I would be picturing DC Lewis from the Inspector Morse series, which I enjoyed very much, but while watching this I became so engrossed with this character that I was able to enjoy this series and I wish there had been more. It showed him with his kids and with his ex, which he wanted to reunite with, in a real way in that he still had to do his job no matter what. That did not mean that he cared for them less but it is what adults have to do. Throw in there an affair that he had with a co-worker that he still had to work with and you get a very heated atmosphere. I enjoyed this series very much.",1398124800,3,643,3.9160305343511452

8622239,1,B00GD7UMDO,"Awful! Writing pathetic and annoying.  Extremely sexist.  Portrays women as inane annoying ninnies.  Portrays the lead character - Mr. Whately's role - as one of the most immature and self grandized jerks ever.  The plots are rather unbelievable and difficult to follow due to the constant unnecessary subplot between charcter's ex-wife and former mistress... not to mention his sappy children.  Don't waste your money unless you are seriously bored.
