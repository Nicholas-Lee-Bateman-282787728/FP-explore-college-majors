8532415,5,B008Y7Y0MU,".This is a 2-disc set, which studies both the Brian Johnson and Bon Scott years, and each singer gets a disc.  First disc up is the Brian Johnson DVD and it takes you through Back in Black and then all of the albums that follow up to post 2000.  Didn't mind what the reviewers had to say, not bad, I mostly agreed with their appraisals of the albums and of what they had to say regarding AC/DC and the Brian Johnson years.  Fairly interesting and informative, what makes this set interesting is all the concert footage of the group interspersed between the talking heads.  A lot of nice clips ranging from the 80s to post 2000.  I watched the 2nd disc after that relating to Bon Scott and the early years.  Again, it's nice they have a lot of clips.  Only thing I took issue with is the talking heads giving Powerage a measly 3 stars, while there's no end to the praise they lavish on If You Want Blood.  Powerage has always been one of my favorites so found that kind of annoying.  But other than that they mostly did a decent job being 'critics' of all the AC/DC albums and though I'm more of a Bon Scott fan than Brian Johnson, the Brian Johnson DVD was more well done than the Bon Scott DVD.  It's well worth picking up for the casual fan.  About the only thing that could have made it better, short of axing their review on Powerage, would be if they included all the concert clips in their entirety as a separate link, so that when you were finished hearing all the talk - - which often interupts performance clips - you could go back and watch the clips uncut by the talking heads.  But this is DVD review so you expect talking heads and I have seen some sets that are all talk and contain no music of the band they are actually reviewing, so at least you get SOME music interspersed with the talk.  And yes this is quite a bit of music - - most of Bon clips I'd seen before.  Hadn't seen any of the Brian Johnson stuff, and that's another reason I enjoyed that DVD more.  Some nice concert stuff of him in 1980 singing on Back in Black tour which is obviously vintage stuff.  Yeah would have been nice to include a whole section of just the clips in their entirety alone without any talk at all, but oh well.  It's still a pretty well put together package.",1512864000,,2264,4.24009324009324
