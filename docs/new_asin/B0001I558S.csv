8012895,1,B0001I558S,"Do you remember sitting in a College Class that the Professor was almost entertained by his own talking and bullet-head references? Well I was uninspired by Ingo's style, obviously he is more comfortable at some Lab. sitting in some white coat than he is teaching his material.
DO NOT expect to come away from this Training Material with any more knowledge of remote viewing then you currently have or know.
Save your money and go out to eat somewhere and imagine that you can remote view what undergarmets the waitress has on.",1330300800,22,527,4.739130434782608
8012896,5,B0001I558S,Ingo Swann is the ultimate authority on remote viewing.  This is the place to get the facts. Incredible DVDs!  Fascinating!,1240704000,2,123,5.1
8012897,1,B0001I558S,"Most ESP documentaries, or books are just awful. I have read quite a few, and my meditation sessions still reveal more detailed events in present, or future more than what I have learned from these types of films and books. The camera work is shoddy, they even have a moment where they  gave a prayer to someone they know that had passed at the time of the lecture....okay, it was not a minute, more like 15 minutes. Terrible in every way I did not expect. The lecturers side-step their own presentations MANY times, Forget most of what they are trying to explain, and add far too much extraneous information than anything else I have purchased that has been 'exclusive' to UFOTV fans. Do not buy this product. Unless you want to edit the final package yourself, to find some understanding in what they are trying to convey.",1230249600,28,824,4.605442176870748
