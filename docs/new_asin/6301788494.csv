362420,2,6301788494,I was really excited when they announced the release of Spaced Invaders on DVD.  I preordered it and got it soon after release.  I have seen the movie many times but on my first viewing of the DVD last night was sorely dissappointed that it was the cleaned up over dubbed (badly and not even thoroughly)version. This seems to be a TV verson albeit widescreen.  If you want the real thing then don't buy this! If you have never seen the movie then it is ok.  I still laughed even though I was in mid dissappointment.,1040860800,11,515,4.333333333333333
362421,5,6301788494,"I love this movie.  The gags are predictable, but the celebrity voice impersonators do a wonderful job in delivering the dialog.  The movie is good for all ages and does not contain any objectionable material. I give it two thumbs way up.",1027382400,,238,4.642857142857143
362422,5,6301788494,"I am not a movie critic but I know a great movie when I see one you will laugh out loud, plenty of fun to watch for the whole family. our first copy of this movie was on VHS it's been worn out so bad we can't watch it anymore, regretably. please re release this movie I would buy in a heart beat.",977529600,3,296,3.7142857142857144
362423,5,6301788494,"On my first viewing of Spaced Invaders I made a tragic mistake: I took it seriously. When renting it later just for the heck of it I realized that it's supposed to be just as goofy and unbelievable as it is. It's not just a funny movie; it's a forgotten classic. The first time you see it you're likely to be distracted by the sappy ET-style friendship between Arianna Richards and a cute little robot-thing, but make no mistake: This movie is not just another Mac & Me.
The story: The Martian Empire is attacking Arcturus under the command of enforcer drones whose inflexibility turns the entire fleet into cannon fodder; a civilian asteroid patrol with five loony Martians and a drone of their own picks up what they think is a cry for help from the embattled citizens of Earth. What they don't know is that the little town of Big Bean is merely broadcasting ""War of the Worlds"" on Halloween night, so their efforts to join up with the invasion force after a crash landing get them mixed up with a bunch of trick-or-treaters, a costumed mob of gun-toting rednecks, a farmer obsessed with getting pictures for the tabloids, a new Sheriff out of his depth, and their own enforcer drone.
The dialogue in this film is sharp and wittily delivered, set amongst small but incredibly humorous moments that could be missed the first time through but reward second and third viewings trmendously. Little things from a dog changing film in a camera offscreen to the ""Duck!"" scene make the movie special, and crazy elements like Vern ""Zorro"" Pillsbury, turned from zero to hero via a Martian robot slave transformation, keep things nutty. Brian the duck is a show-stealer who actually does remind us at times of Daffy--right down to the accent--while old man Wrenchmuller and his trusty dog Jim try to deal with the Martians in their barn like any cartoon character would: with mousetraps and dynamite.
Forget that it's silly to have five Martians voiced as celebrity parodies--it's supposed to be silly. Sit back and watch it with your family this Halloween, and remember not to put tab A into slot B when you assemble your world domination kit. As for me, I can't wait for this one to hit DVD.",971827200,30,2185,4.677922077922078
362424,4,6301788494,"So says young Kathy Hoxly (played by Arianna Richards) and that about sums it up.  A five-martian crew on asteroid patrol intercepts a halloween radio broadcast of Orson Wells'""War of the Worlds"" and, thinking it's  the real thing, decide to hit the Earth, which they do, literally.  Between  slapstick sight gags, some slick comic dialogue and some truly unique  trick-or-treating, this Sci-Fi spoof hits on all cylinders, or whatever  they call them in that space thingamajig.  Royal Dano is excellent as Mr  Wrenchmuller, who thinks his pictures of the invading Martians are just the  ticket to save his failing farm.  Unfortunately, its hard to tell who's the  brains of the team, Mr Wrenchmuller or his dog ""Jim"".
The  Martian crew, led by Captain Bipto and his sidekick ""Ferndroid"",  bumble their way through the invasion, pursued by the irate inhabitants of  the town of Big Bean and an equally irate ""enforcer drone"" who's  out to see that they succeed or die trying (or is that frying?).  The  action moves at a hectic clip, accompanied by the frequent commentary of  cynical Navigator/Pilot Blazney.
A bewildering display of alien  technology is displayed, or at least referred to, including heat rays,  donuts of destruction, fried megaspazz redundancy piles, bruised boo-boos  and a loveable polypropelene droidlet called ""Shortstuff"", all  accompanied by the frantic war cry ""Prepare to die, Earth  scum!""
The wildly disparate plot elements come together for a  clever, multi-tiered ending that is both comical and emotionally  satisfying.
Two suggestions:  Don't eat before watching this movie, and  leave yourself plenty of rug to roll around on.",944697600,15,1661,5.240458015267175
362425,5,6301788494,"I have rented this several times, and just can not get enough of it. The Martins all have their own unique personality. I love the ""Jack Nicolson"" and the ""German Scientist"" Martins.
 Good  special effects, and the story line is cute how a lone group of Martins try  to land on earth and conquer earth. But it is not as easy as it seems.
 I  wish this movie would be available again for purchase here, I'd buy it in a  snap.
 Yes, lots of good one-liners in this movie.",940550400,5,469,4.202247191011236
362426,5,6301788494,"This was and is one of the all time sci-fi comedy clasics.  Ranks with ""Space Balls"".  ""Prepare to die Earth scum"" , should be one of moviedoms most menorable lines.  Its ""Planes, Trains, and  Automoblies"" from space.  Anyone who did not like this and kept from  bustin' a gut during it needs to have their head examined.  These bumbling  aliens are the 80's verison of the Three Stooges.  A must see over and  over.",935798400,2,416,4.5

362570,4,6301788494,"In the minuscule town of Big Bean, the local yokels are preparing for Halloween.  The towns radio station is broadcasting Orson Welles practical joke, The War of the Worlds.  People actually took it seriously when it was first broadcasted back in 1938.  But who would be so dumb to think it was real, again............  Cue idiot Martian soldiers separated from an interstellar war against the Arcturans.  Left out of the grand battle, this ragtag band of nitwits crash lands in a barn and quickly decide that Earth is handy and ripe for an invasion, waste not want not.  Its an opportunity!  Some would call it initiative.  Unfortunately, they are not quite the menace they think they are.  And the townsfolk are armed and dangerous.

This is a weird little sci-fi flick aimed squarely at children.  It tries valiantly to be a comedy but most of the time its just trying.  But as it features the incomparable Royal Dano as a crafty farmer, I found myself liking it more as the plot slowly unraveled.",1494028800,,1000,4.716763005780347

It is family friendly with almost no bad words and our kids love this movie as much as we do.

This is based very loosely on The War of the Worlds that we all know and love but this time we see it from the Martian perspective (they ain't too smart either lol).

They come here bent on planetary conquest but end up going trick or treating and making a few friends along the way.

We have two copies on VHS, one copy on DVD, and now finally blue ray.  This is one of our all time favorite family friendly movies and our ""go to"" Halloween tradition.",1469232000,,682,4.128787878787879

362808,5,6301788494,"So I originally saw this movie when I was a kid and had forgotten all about it. I recently stumbled upon it by accident when I saw the DVD version in a store locally. I instantly remembered how much I loved this movie as a kid and I got all of those warm nostalgic feelings and instantly looked to see if they had it on Blu-Ray.

Well they didn't, and I was not even sure if it had even been released in Blu-Ray format so I had pretty much decided to buy in on DVD right there. Luckily, I resisted my overwhelming urge to have it right then and checked Amazon on my phone to see it was available in Blu-ray instead. To my great delight it was and it was cheaper than the DVD version in the local store.

The only issue was could I wait the two days that it would take to arrive to my door with prime shipping. Well after deciding that I had probably waited over 15 years since I have last seen it I could probably hold out a couple more days.

I ordered it on my phone and waited the two excruciatingly long days for it to arrive at my house. The day it was to be delivered I almost took the day off of work (just kidding).

I opened the box with that happy Amazon smile on the outside and forced my wife and kids to all come down stairs and watch it. None of them had ever seen it by the way and not one of them seemed to share my excitement.

I opened the package and put this cinematic masterpiece in my Blu-Ray player and cranked up my surround sound system. One hour and forty one minutes later my love of this movie was still as strong as I remembered it. My wife and kids loved it as well, maybe not quite as much as I do but they have watched it multiple times on their own since then so thats a good indication.

I will admit nostalgia plays a big part in my love of this film; it takes me back to my childhood where everything was just so simple. It is a great family movie that anyone can enjoy that does not take itself too seriously.

If you enjoy movies from the 80s & 90s in the same vein as movies like The Goonies, Monster Squad and ET it is a pretty good bet you will enjoy this one as well.",1459468800,,2109,3.971631205673759

362895,5,6301788494,"A great, kid appropriate, adult entertaining almost unknown classic for Halloween viewing.  I can't remember when I first saw this movie...sometime in my childhood, but it truly is a funny, goofball classic that makes me laugh every single time I watch it.

Based loosely on War of the Worlds, a misfit group of martians banished to ""asteroid patrol"" catch an earth broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"", misinterpret the broadcast as an actual invasion (much like our grandparents did with the original broadcast) and rush in to join the ""invasion"" only to find they've really gotten themselves in over their heads...antennae...whatever.  :)

For years, science has speculated on the existence of intelligent life in space... Now, there is living proof there is no such thing.

It's a close encounter of the hilarious kind when five of the universe's coolest aliens crash-land on planet Earth! Piloted by an ultra-hip Martian, the cosmic crew ends up in a sleepy Midwestern town. Unfortunately, it is Halloween Night and the citizens mistake these spaced invaders for harmless trick-or-treaters. Instead of the global invasion they planned on, these misguided Martians bungle their way into a series of madcap misadventures! Get set for an outrageous blast of intergalactic fun and outlandish special effects in this wacked-out comedy-adventure!

FILM FACT: During the end title music, there is homage to the TV series My Favorite Martian as the first bars of the show's theme song are sung by one of the Invaders. During the scene where Martians accidentally launch the mortar-like ""Scout in a Can"" Captain Ziploc exclaims, ""What in the name of Uncle Martin is that?"" again, also a nod to the TV series My Favorite Martian. For most of the film the deputy has a half sunburned face, which is a reference to what happened to Roy [Richard Dreyfuss] in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: On the 50th anniversary of the Orson Welles' 1938 The War of the Worlds radio broadcast dramatization, and the Big Bean radio station DJ [Casey Sander] puts on the Long Player Album of the recording of the famous radio broadcast,  and the signal happens to be picked up by a passing spaceship crewed by a lost unit of the Martian Space Navy, who are fooled into thinking that their comrades are mounting a mass invasion of the Earth and thus promptly zap down to Big Bean, in Illinois, in order to join in the invasion. Led by Captain Bipto [Jimmy Briscoe] who wears aviator glasses and a leather flying jacket, and whose voice bears a remarkable resemblance to Jack Nicholson's, The Martians accidently pick up the radio broadcast of Orson Welles' 1938 ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast dramatization, on Halloween Night and assume they are late for the invasion.

While there is nothing Earth-shattering about director Patrick Read Johnson's first film, it is often very entertaining. SPACED INVADERS makes hilarious silly fun of just about every outer space sci-fi film ever made, and throws in some Three Stooges-like mayhem for good measure. The simple yet creative story line concerns a small group of Martians, who are short green creatures with heads that look like watermelons, who believe they are supposed to invade Earth.

Their broken-down spacecraft lands near Big Bean in Illinois, on Halloween Night. Sam [Douglas Barr], the town's new sheriff, and his daughter, Ten-year-old Kathy [Ariana Richards] who is disguised as a Martian, immediately recognises the invaders and becomes suspicious of everybody and at the same time has a sensible, Alice-in-Wonderland type quality about her, and is at the same time is joined by Brian [J.J. Anderson] who Alice asks him ''Are you a Martian?'' but Brian declares ''I'm a duck,'' who indeed is wearing a duck costume and finally we are joined by Mr. Wrenchmuller [Royal Dano], an old man whose farm is about to be repossessed on whose farm the Martians have crash-landed, who all three are out to help the Martians avoid the townspeople who want to kill them. ""Prepare to die Earth scum,"" one Martian repeatedly tells the townsfolk, but Captain Bipto [Jimmy Briscoe] just wants to get home in one piece. The ensuing action allows for jokes that are sometimes slightly dumb, but at the same time mildly funny and hilarious.

What you get with SPACED INVADERS is ET meets Monty Python, with a little subtle Hollywood crazy humour thrown in, and it is not as bad as it sounds. Kathy [Ariana Richards] takes on her role as the new kid in town with a joyful mixture of innocence and precociousness and declares that ""They're not bad, just stupid,"" Kathy says of the Martians, and her father can't help but believe her.  SPACED INVADERS is definitely a fantastic silly spoof on the genre of alien films and sometimes edges on fine comedy, with a twist of silliness, but can be slightly uneven at times, but is definitely aimed at a targeted audience of 10 to 12-year-olds, but I feel it is also enjoyable for adults of all ages to enjoy with their children where I know they will definitely have a really good laugh throughout the film, as there are some really quirky funny characters, especially this hip aliens. SPACED INVADERS has all the elements of a very good sci-fi film; and one I really enjoyed viewing, even though some of the scenes get a bit silly and over the top, but overall it was a really enjoyable sci-fi comedy romp.

Blu-ray Video Quality  SPACED INVADERS is presented in a 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. The 1080p image at times isn't as sharp as one would like, and frequently suffers from a little softness. This is never too distracting and the image presents the basics well enough, though with not much pizzazz so to speak, especially with any great detail, presenting general textures with relative ease but lacking the complexity of a finely-honed filmic presentation. The image is littered with evidence of wear in the way of speckles and stray vertical lines, and grain is thick. It is about what audiences have come to expect from Touchstone Pictures and Mill Creek Entertainment, a very serviceable but in no way dazzling presentation, but despite this, I still enjoyed is what I viewed of this Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  SPACED INVADERS is presented with a 2.0 Dolby Digital Ultra Stereo. The soundtrack is slightly flat at times, offering little range. Dialogue remains clear at all times, but despite this, it is still a fun time sound track. Sound is presented presents in a style with no drift or sense of space, making it, for all intents and purposes, more like a mono soundtrack. Sadly at times it fails to excite the aural senses. Various crashing and action effects fall flat, presenting the basic sound effect but nothing more. Ambience is practically non-existent, still despite this the dialogue is at least steady and never a struggle to hear. Despite some of my negative remarks, I still got to enjoy this sci-fi comedy romp.

Finally, overall SPACED INVADERS is a madcap zany sci-fi spoof film, that has loads of twists and turns to keep you amused throughout the 101 minutes running time. There is a lot worse out there for sure and it is all pretty by the book scenario, but at the very least the costumes and make-up effects were very passable. Its not one of those B-movies where the acting is terrible and the sets are off and all that; its actually of pretty good production value. Visually it looks pretty cool, especially with all the madcap trick or treaters, aliens, spaceships, crazy characters, wacky contraptions and so on, and I mean all of those things in a favourable way. The use of the Orson Welles' 1938 The War of the Worlds radio broadcast dramatization is nicely done, the effects are fun in a retro sort of way and there are some real laughs to be had and I especially like the Martians blowing up a missile ""grain"" silo with their heat ray and of course is a reference I wonder to residents of Grover's Mill allegedly attacking a water tower during the 1938 broadcast and all getting buried in a mountain of popcorn. Best of all is the visual inventiveness of the sci-fi comedy film and someone certainly had an eye for detail on this very funny sci-fi film. The costumes and make-up work are great and look out for lovely little touches like the reclining Martian lady painted World War II style on the side of the spaceship. Certainly don't expect to be intellectually challenged by SPACED INVADERS, but you can safely anticipate a lot of fun and frolics, if somewhat a perplexing real oddity of a sci-fi film. But despite it being over the top zany fun, I really enjoyed watching it and because it was made in 1990, the effects look slightly dated, compared if it had been made today, as well at times can become very cheesy laugh out loud comedy, but despite this anomaly, I had a really great fun watching SPACED INVADERS, so give it a chance, as you will not be disappointed. This sci-fi comedy film kind of came and went upon its initial release, but is no doubt a guilty pleasure film for some, especially like me. Highly Recommended!

A time when a piece of scotch tape covering the square hole on the VHS tape was the solution to being able to record on it again and again.  That's what I did to get this movie on VHS - record it from an airing on TV.  This particular tape had 2 movies on it: Back to the Future II and Spaced Invaders.  I wore it out from what seemed like a thousand viewings.  All of that happened when I was 7 or 8 years old.  I'm now 30 and hadn't seen this movie in probably 20 years.  What a nostalgic night this past Wednesday was.  I watched it just like I did as a kid - right after Back to the Future II.  On October 21, 2015.

Spoiler alert.  The inept Martian forces go to war with the Arcturians.  Meanwhile on Earth it's Hallowe'en and the
new Sherrif of Big Bean, Illinois (Douglas Barr, remember him from Fall Guy?) and his little girl (artist Arianna Richards in
her debut role, remember her as the vegitarian little granddaughter from Jurasic Park?) have just moved there
and she's afraid the locals won't like her Alien costume in a town where her dad's big crime rate would be cows in the street.
Over at the Big Bean radio station they are playing Orson Wells 'War of the Worlds.'  Now, the last faction of the Martian
attack force hears this broadcast and thinks Mars is attacking the Earth so they go there to join war.  These little green guys
make Yoda seem conservative.  I found this movie a hoot BEFORE I learned my friends (from the band And...And...And)
Mike McClure and David Friendly wrote the ending them song 'Matians are Taking Over The World' (Mike is the guitar and

363422,5,6301788494,"By 1990, the idea of Martians invading earth as movie
plot was laughable and this film takes full advantage
of that mind-set.

`Spaced Invaders' is a mostly family friendly movie
with witty humor, impressive effects (considering its
budget and the year it was made), imagination and a
charm all its own.

On Halloween night, five Martians on patrol in the
asteroid belt respond to a distress call from the
imperial armada and after losing contact, they pick up
a broadcast from earth saying that earth and mars are
having a `War of the Worlds.' Assuming that the
broadcast is an earth distress call, they speed off to
the blue planet to join their brethren in conquering
humanity only to crash and get stranded in a rural
American town just in time for the perils of `trick or
treating,' highway safety, obsessive farmers, and,
worst of all, angry parents.

This film should be a part everyone's Halloween tradition,
through bare in mind that its PG rating based on the
standards of the 1990's, so parents may wish to preview
it first before showing it to small children.

Also the instant video version is the original 1990 version
as opposed to the DVD re-edit that replaced the word
'moron' with 'maroon'. The re-dubbing is done poorly and
throws the humor's pacing off. It was done in order to be
more 'politically correct' as the word 'moron' has an obsolete
definition in the word of psychology referring to metal
retardation, yet the world they replaced it with can refer
to exiled North American slaves, so 'maroon' can be considered
even more offensive when it is used as an insult.

Either way, if you decide to buy, or rent this movie you will not
be disappointed. Have fun watching it and have a
Happy Halloween. `Vern-droid away!'",1390780800,,1743,4.739273927392739

This has to be the worst fifteen dollars I've spent. The movie itself is almost unwatchable, because of all the curse words! There had to be at least ten curses. (Why does it have to be that way? Heck and darn work just as well, thank you.) Other than that the movie was just empty, not much of anything happened. It was NOT funny.

Babylon 5 fans will especially appreciate the film if they know that actor Wayne Alexander was Sebastian in the episode ""Comes the Inquisitor.""  Good luck trying to equate Vern with the man ""known only as . . .'Jack' . . .""

A classic, understated performance by Royal Dano holds charm of its own, starting with the early scene in which the obnoxious banker is yapping on, oblivious to the old man (Dano) as he casually checks his various pockets, trying to find shells for his shotgun.

I saw Spaced Invaders first during it's theatrical release. When the VHS came out I grabbed it up thinking it couldn't have been as fun as I remembered, but it was.
Now it's on DVD and I've bought it again.
If you saw it in the theater or on VHS then the DVD is going to make you scratch your head instead of laugh in a couple of spots where the language has been sanitized (why, I have no idea. 8 year olds use stronger language.) If you've never seen it the DVD will open up a world we rarely get to see anymore- well done comedy. It is one of the best written comedy movies I've seen since, well to be honest I can't think of one. This has something for everyone kids and adults. The pace is even and sustained throughout.
