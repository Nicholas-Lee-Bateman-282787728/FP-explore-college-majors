8436722,5,B004NJC0RA,"Excellent, well done.  It's not one of those ""life of a salmon"" documentaries we have seen on TV many times, but a well-presented and well-edited movie that both shows and explains the difficulties presented to salmon by the many dams on the Columbia River system, and the well-intentioned, but flawed, attempts to mitigate those difficulties.  And, it brings us uptodate on some hopeful changes that are underway.",1418083200,3,414,5.164179104477612
8436723,5,B004NJC0RA,"This documentary is about the path that millions of salmons USED TO TAKE, some 900 miles up the rivers and streams, without any of those eight dams on Columbia River,  from west coast, Pacific Ocean to the heart of Idaho, an elevation rise of 6000 feet to a place to produce millions of red balls, salmon eggs. In 2006 only three salmons made it to the top, that is only three instead of thirty million or more salmon.

Eco system has no chance with humans in the picture since humans are the only creatures that do not care for the concept that everything in this universe is interconnected.",1412294400,2,592,4.472222222222222
8436724,4,B004NJC0RA,"This film does a good job detailing some of the challenges facing maintaining salmon stocks that are challenged by giant hydroelectric dams, but it is sort of depressing to watch.

I bought the video to help my young sons develop an appreciation for the fascinating life cycle of salmon and their important role in many ecosystems.  It does this in sort of a backhanded and depressing way.

My sons definitely learned a lot about salmon, but they did not really like the video much because of its downbeat tone.",1360281600,,511,4.719101123595506
8436725,2,B004NJC0RA,"I was very disappointed. This was meant for tree huggers with no ""in between"" solutions or discussion allowed. The only solution given is to just remove all dams...and there was no discussion of the consequences of doing that. There are solutions but the producers didn't want to even mention them. At one time there is a statement that the northwest should just find another source of electricity...period. Never mind the huge consequence of that single minded attitude. Hydro power is the cheapest, most efficient and the statement is to just get rid of it. I do not think that all the possibilities of saving the salmon have been tried and there is much to try. A particular river of stream designated for salmon could possibly be made perfect for producing fish....but lets go all out and condemn all possible solutions other than destroying dams....I am old enough to remember the almost yearly floods before the dams were put in. I know how valuable the electricity was in developing the cities and industry in the northwest. The people interviewed here are not in the least interested in those facts. I think also that there were a lot of assumptions made. One that I question is that the fish don't have the ability to swim effectively through lakes.....I don't think that was a proven fact. I have the feeling that there are better solutions than just the very radical solution of ""no dams"", but that would not further the aims of the ""lets destroy the dams"" people.",1350259200,2,1475,4.788235294117647
8436726,5,B004NJC0RA,"Informative and interesting video of the importance of salmon, and obstacles that they must overcome including man made and predators.  This point becomes very clear as the film explains how much money various governmental agencies are spending to save the salmon.  Even if you don't live in an area where the salmon spawn, you will enjoy learning about them, their challenges and their importance to us.",1346803200,2,404,5.106060606060606
8436727,4,B004NJC0RA,"I love the taste of salmon.  It's one of the few healthy things I eat.  However, I could watch this without wanting to go buy some salmon to eat.

Salmon swim in lots of different waters, but they only breed in the wild in certain specific streams.  Well, humans damned those streams up and then were surprised that the salmon weren't reproducing.  This doc speaks about all that goes on in trying to address the matter.

It turns out that we've been putting fish in hatcheries for decades.  Still, the fish need help getting back to the ocean.  Farm-raised fish eat near the surface, so bird easily scoop them up when released.  The turbines in the damns often dice them up.  Sea lions cash in on humans dumping salmon at a certain point in the same predictable spots.  Further, the disappearance of salmon may violate many Native American treaties.

They show a pair of salmon breeding.  I wasn't expecting them to ""do the nasty.""  However, those who think all animals breed like in ""March of the Penguins"" will be in for a surprise.  When the fish were releasing eggs and male-goo, they did have their mouths open and I wonder if it felt orgasmic to them.  The documentary never answers why salmon die after breeding.  I also would like to know if some of them avoid breeding just to stay alive.  (Did the two breeding fish get male-goo in their mouths?!?)

This seemed like a straw man argument.  If factor X caused the problem, then it's obvious that getting rid of factor X would be the solution.  The work tries to end on a positive note.  It has an environmental message similar to ""Avatar"" and ""The Lion King.""  The fish eat bugs and then they are eaten by larger animals and then the bugs dine on their leftover corpses and bones.

The work also raises concerns about biodiversity.  One interviewee states, ""We used to have Bach, Beethoven, and Handl and now we have Yanni, Yanni, and Yanni.""  This work is full of catchy quotes like that.",1306972800,,1949,4.5606936416184976
