These simple brothers, who loved and cared for each other their whole lives, lacked the sophistication and social framework to deal  with the complicated events and social accountability brought on by one  brother's death.  The quality of the storytelling is top notch and appears  to have been as even-handed as it could be.",944784000,5,413,4.8428571428571425

520911,5,6302806577,"OUTSTANDING!!  This movie is from a different generation, yet ""people"" internally remain the same.  It SO accurately portrays these hard-working brothers, devastated by one's death, then, for one to have to be accused.  It shows a ""community.""  They lived and let live.  And, when one of their own - who they ""let live their own lives"" became a target of another type of people who totally did not understand those who live ""differently,"" they all came together to support them.  Love for each other emanated in this movie.  The bond of 4 brothers who never really grew up.  Very intensely internal emotional feelings this movie creates.  I have watched it over and over and still see things I maybe didn't see before.  Thanks to Bruce and Joe for ever making it.  I think at the end it shows SO clearly how childlike and unable to comprehend these boys were when Roscoe said, ""come up this summer, and calls all their names, and take some pictures of the nice green leaves and green grass.  To him, they had come up there to take pictures of their place - with some comprehension of the story - not sure if he did or not.  I hope this is like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in its length of longevity.",1441670400,,1195,4.502325581395349

520951,4,6302806577,"The first 45 minutes of this film, which is about a suspicious death in a family of isolated social outcasts in rural New York, is pretty slow.  It also reminded me of some of the horrible manipulative films about eccentric families with dark secrets, like August: Osage County, for one.  It gets better as things move toward an exploration of the investigation and trial, however.  As a lawyer, I found it an interesting lesson in how people's attitudes about allegedly criminal actions change when they are in the position of responsibility for imposing judgments of guilt, or punishment.",1400544000,,590,5.0
520952,3,6302806577,"In 1991 a reclusive rural NY farmer was acquitted of having killed his brother by means of suffocation.  This film follows the trial and explores the support the community gave the accused. As depicted in the film the farmer (Dilbert Ward) confessed to the ""crime"" (if there was one) while in police custody based on the false promise that ""if you would just cooperate"" it would be over and he could go home.  The confession was corroborated by one of Dilbert's surviving brothers under similar circumstances.  There was no other evidence. Based on interviews and trial footage it seems unlikely that either of the brothers truly understood what was going on.  The problem with this otherwise interesting story is that the film spends an inordinate amount of time interviewing inarticulate locals for no clear purpose.  There are also amateurish interviews with Dilbert (sample - ""How did you feel in police custody?  Answer: ""Nervous"", Q: ""You were nervous?"" A: ""Yeah"")  This drags down the first half of the film which never really recovers until the trial actually starts.",1399161600,,1075,5.03954802259887

I didn't realize this was made a while ago, because the packaging makes it look like it was done fairly recently.

521013,5,6302806577,"As far as filmmaking goes, a courtroom drama is a director's wet dream. It has everything one needs for a movie already built in: crime, suspense, drama, good vs. evil, high stakes, etc. It would have been no surprise if Berlinger and Sinofsky had simply expanded the background story of the Ward brothers and allowed the rest of the drama to unfold on its own, but what makes this film so heartfelt and tragic is the way in which they choose to avoid this clich&eacute;. Instead the directors choose to tell the brother's story through neighbors' testimony as well as through good old-fashioned observance. We watch as they complete mundane and repetitive farm work, and we watch as they become inundated with local news reporters; we watch and we see the tension which is building between these two worlds, and we wait, hopeful for the brother's sake, that soon it will end. This is a courtroom drama, but by the end whether or not the verdict surprises you is not the point. By the end you will have lost faith in the premise that in this situation, there could be such a thing as justice.

Brother's Keeper is not just compassionate, it is humanistic, and it would take someone cold indeed to not be touched by the humanity on display. Even though the characters we are watching seem strange to us, we feel connected to their suffering and their human desire to be accepted, or at least respected. Brother's Keeper is also a beautiful work of art, mesmerizing in its images and sounds. It is an homage to the simpler times of farm life in America--and after you've watched it from the modern comfort of your couch or chair, it will force you to step outside and take a deep breath, and remind you of what life's all about.",1376524800,,1726,4.585760517799352

521050,5,6302806577,"First I need to say that the hog butchering scene was put in as a clear cinematic metaphor for how these two groups of people interact, pretty much like Michael Moore's ""pets or meat?"" scene in Roger and me. The two groups in question are those who run the world, wear suits, make laws, determine guilt or innocence, brush their teeth, bathe, live in houses with indoor plumbing, read books, and manipulate images and those who live closer to their basic needs so know how to birth calves and stay warm at night, but don't worry too much about learning to read or keeping their teeth for a lifetime, etc. Yep, the hog butchering was pretty direct. Kind of hard to miss. A little too on the nose if you ask me!

The rest of the film was brilliant because the filmmakers let the Ward brothers speak for themselves and do a great job of showing the community and interposing the ludicrous language of the court system and phoniness of mass media with stark images of Delbert, when he is faced with losing everything. How many of us in suits will have a community rally for them when the outsiders come and railroad us into some 'justice' system? How many of us would have friends in our ""community"" stand up for us if we stopped shaving and showering? Are the hillbillies really worse off than the ""deciders?"" or the plastic surgery crowd with their shiny SUVs? As a viewer, where do your sympathies lie? Where does your heart lead you even if your mind is screaming with revulsion? How much have we been brainwashed by the culture of the suits?

None of the ""boys"" are very literate and they have spent their entire lives around their cattle farm, seldom interacting much with the people of the small town in which they live.

The documentary shows the love the brothers have for each other. They have lived together and worked together their entire lives and don't know any other way of life. The townsfolk didn't have much to do with them. However, when Bill died and Delbert was accused of his murder, they all stepped up to support him. They raised money for his defense and stood by him right to the end.

This is truly a beautiful example of so many things. It should remind us all that under certain circumstances, any one of us could find ourselves in a position of trying to defense ourselves from a legal system that we can only hope will work for us.

My heart broke when one of the brother's got on the stand and lost it, shaking uncontrollably and breathing so heavy I thought he was going to die right there on the stand. He was so nervous and so broken up about what was going on he could not handle it and all I wanted to do was give him the biggest hug ever and tell him it was going to be ok. I believe he was the brother that is on the cover of this movie. I was glad the outcome was what it was, because they would not be able to function without one another and you can see it in Delbert's face, he is lost without the brother who passed away. This is a movie I will never forget! A definite must see!!",1350259200,,1210,4.13135593220339

This movie was interesting and helped my reflections back to 1990 - 1991 so focused on my own career and retirement options.  Where was I in my life story during this time period?  The Ward brother's farm story and daily life was hard to detail before the trial clips and after the trial verdict.  It is possible the best emotions came on film from clips taken after the trial was complete.  Reviewing the commentary and observation of the director's mood with brief comments was value added to the project - good idea or bad idea.  This movie was interesting because it was over so quickly after pressing the start button on dvd player.  Very Good Job.  Being from upstate New York, involved with dairy farming, there were many elderly men involved with the daily farm work rather than young teens and twenties.  The townspeople were clearly interested in the movie makers from the city.  The health issues of friends who arrived to assist left me with sad feelings as food items being served today is much like the feast at the benefits and diner.  What was a horse doing in the dairy barn while milking duty was being performed?  NYS Health Department requirements for shipping milk was discussed briefly.

in their town when one is charged with the murder of another.

The locals all believe these sweet, sad, simple, almost retarded seeming souls are incapable of murder, and that Delbert
Ward is either being framed entirely, or unfairly prosecuted for a mercy killing in a world where putting an animal out of
it's suffering is the norm.

A portrait of rural America like nothing we see in fiction films; there are people living completely out-of-touch with
reality and the modern world, and others who are as sophisticated and insightful as any city dweller.

It's also a portrait of law enforcement with what seems to be an agenda beyond just the truth.
It all builds to a courtroom sequence more tense than almost any Hollywood thriller. A quite special film.

I wish it didn't wear it's biases quite so on its sleeve.  I'd have rather had a chance to make up my own mind

THe Ward brothers were four brothers who lived in the small town of Munneville, NY, living a rather simple life to say the least.  When the cameras were on the surviving three, they seem like nervous children trapped in old men's bodies, fidgity and unsure of themselves.  They are barely literate, live a rural life, and are all living in a house that is practically crumbling down around them.  THey sleep in the same bed, live in squalor, and have little contact with the outside world.  Their neighbors are more advanced at least in terms of their living conditions, but they are, like the Wards, rural people with rural problems and concerns.  The Wards, however, live their lives in a rather sad way, hoarding garbage and devoid of social skills.

One of the Ward brothers murders the other by suffocation.  Suddenly they are at the center of some media firestorm as people want to know more about these hermits who are suddenly not so harmless after all.  We are suddenly fascinated by these three (formerly four) oddities that would have otherwise slipped under the radar.  It's rather sad to see people living like this, knowing how helpless they are and how this is their past, present and future all at the same time.  Commentary on the justice system, the difference between rural vs. city people will rise.  What does it tell us?  Perhaps this was more of an eccentric character study than anything else.  And they are out there, all around us, but we will never see them because they keep to themselves and never draw attention.

I noticed that there were a few comments about this film being a little slow. One person even stated that he couldn't remember if he fell asleep and finished watching the entire film. This reminded me of my father, who if a movie does not have sex, car chases, fast pased action or anything to pin his interest, his attention span will reach the end of its window of opportunity and he will doze off into dream land. The snoring is what lets us all know that this has happened. Perhaps it has to do with our individual character traits, but if you like documentaries, news magazine programs, you will love this film! It was very well edited; in a way that allows you to follow the story line and get a good sense of the brothers' personalities and even develope a subtle sort of emotional bond with them and their supporters. What I also liked about the film is that it depicts with great accuracy how the human mind can derail so drastically. At one point, for example, the prosecution had turned this case into an incest, sex-gone-bad crime (between two brothers who are past their mid 60s)! What did Jerry Springer's show do to the collective mind of humanity? I know there is more to it than that, but it helps me to point out how outlandish I thought this twist was. I couldn't believe it! I found myself shaking my head back and forth and it was then that I realized that this film was really good because it had evoked a reaction. As the tension builds, you are led from the outside expanse of their vast and open land to the inside of a courtroom. Tension builds as you see how one of the poor brother tenses up to the point that he almost goes into cardiac arrest there on the hotseat as the prosecutor is interogating him! Then the jury goes out to deliberate and you are left wondering which way the legal pendulum will swing! But I am not going to be the one to ruin the ending for you!

521152,4,6302806577,"Brother's Keeper (Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, 1992)

The saga of the Ward Boys remains, fifteen years later, one of the outright weirdest murder cases in American history. The Ward Boys were four brothers wholived outside Munnsville, NY, a bucolic upstate town. Their lives were turned upside down when William, the oldest brother, died. His brother Adelbert was arrested for his murder. Not out of the ordinary, you say? It becomes so when you realize that Adelbert, the youngest of the bunch, was fifty-nine when he stood trial.

Berlinger and Sinofsky seem to side with the prosecution's original thesis, that the killing was an act of euthanasia. Bill Ward was, evidently, suffering from a terminal disease, and had gotten to the point where life was nothing but pain. Thus, the original question the movie asks is whether euthanasia ought to be a crime. That is a worthwhile subject for a documentary in itself (and has been the subject of more than a few), but things get a whole lot weirder when the prosecution changes its angle of attack and starts labeling the murder as a deviant sex crime. No, I won't spoil the fun for you; watch the film and you can see the prosecution spell out this ludicrous idea in their own words. Berlinger and Sinofsky spent months in Munnsville, interviewing everyone they could get their hands on and more, and we get an interesting picture of the town and the Ward Boys themselves (who seem to have no real idea of what's going on; the best-educated of them is semi-literate, and all seem to suffer various levels of hearing difficulty). It may be hard for people to grasp how, in the nineteen-nineties, four brothers could possibly live in such squalor, and without most of the modern conveniences (for example, their shack has no running water); as shocking as the murder trial is, the day-to-day existence of the Ward Boys is even more so.

Here we are a decade and a half later, and Lyman, the last of the Wards, died in August of 2007. Thus, it is almost certain that we will never know what happened on the night of Bill Ward's death. Ultimately, however, it's a question that doesn't need answered; this started out as a document of a murder trial, but became a story about four brothers, three of whom stand against an adversity they cannot fathom. It is fine cinema from first minute to last, and well worth watching. ****",1207008000,3,2378,4.725301204819277

521155,5,6302806577,"I was alerted to ""Brother's Keeper"" by its' listing in a book roughly titled ""The NY Times Best 1000 Movies"".  I generally enjoy documentaries but they seem to lack the necessary outlet to reach a wider audience.  Outside of the works of Michael Moore and Al Gore, I don't see people lining up at theaters to watch the latest documentaries.  That's one of the reasons I keep an eye on the IFC schedule.  ""Brother's Keeper"" is a film worth seeing.

The movie tells the story of a family of four brothers who farm in upstate New York.  These brothers are right out of ""Deliverance"" and, if there's any confusion about that, the omnipresent Appalachian Country Music reminds us that we've seen these people somewhere before.  One of the brother's complains of a pain and is found dead in the bed he shares with one of his brothers.  The brother initially confessed to having smothered his brother but later recants after thinking it over.  He essentially is saying that the investigators lead him along and he just followed and tried to be helpful.  A trial (certainly the Trial of the Century for this hamlet) begins with a lot of media coverage.  This film crew was obviously part of the media that saw a unique story and we can be thankful for this in-depth and inside look at the brothers, the community, the legal forces, the crime and its' trial.  It certainly seemed to me that the film company was there fairly early in the sequence of the events.  The verdict is something I didn't know ahead of time so I won't share that with you.  I liked the way the movie comes to a cloture.

What I didn't like was the way these brothers were profiled.  They were shown as more than just developmentally retarded folks, they were portrayed somewhat as though they were all the results of a fourth successive generation of incest.  While no specific allegations as such were made, the soundtrack sounds like something out of ""Deliverence"" without the dueling banjos.  I realize that their mental capacity was a major issue but I really felt that the director way going out of his way to portray these brothers in a stereo-typical manner that seemed to degrade the achievements of the overall content of the film.

Us viewers were completely silent, in awe of the film. When the cop arrived, rather than shutting us down, he stood there and watched the film too! It wasn't until we noticed him that he asked us to turn it down a notch. Since that night, I ordered the film on-line and watched it one morning with a friend of mine who is a lawyer.

As details about Delbert and Bill's unusually close relationship emerge, and the media parasites descend, it's impossible not to feel sympathy for Delbert's plight, especially considering his limited resources, understanding, and isolation from a community that for years has regarded his family with condescension, even thinly veiled contempt. A fascinating glimpse at a seldom-seen, not-so-far-away world, this resonant film is indeed a ""Keeper.""",1184112000,3,681,6.030927835051546
521158,5,6302806577,"Making a myopic documentary can often be a death sentence. But delving into one community and one family can be done well if you don't lose focus. And thankfully directors Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky (Paradise Lost and 10 Days That Unexpectedly Changed America) inherently realized this and kept their cameras firmly in the faces of the Ward family and their surrounding New York community.

Reeling from the alleged murder of 64-year-old Bill Ward by his brother Delbert, the Ward family and their neighbors circle their wagons in support of Delbert. From the get-go we're aware of the Ward brothers' minimal education and unhealthy lifestyle (their home is a stinking shack surrounded by a dairy farm). We're also privy to the fact that Bill was not a well man. His illness is never fully explained, but one could easily surmise cancer as a cause. Initially the story seems bent toward a mercy killing; Delbert smothering brother Bill one night to ""put him out of his misery."" But then homosexual incest rears up (none of the Ward brothers were married), as does animosity between the brothers.

Delbert initially confesses to the murder, but without legal representation present and without apparent knowledge of his rights (a pretty big mistake from a legal standpoint). Delbert is arrested but quickly posts bail thanks to the rural community rallying to his side. No one can believe that Delbert killed Bill. Indeed, Delbert confesses his innocence and states that the only reason he admitted to killing Bill was because he wanted to ""get back home.""

Receiving multiple nominations at film festivals across the globe in 1992, BROTHER'S KEEPER holds quite the moral quagmire for viewers. Some will view Delbert's confession as solid proof that he did it. Others may feel he was the victim of a legal system that is only interested in prosecuting the least of its citizens. Still others may believe Delbert to be guilty of a mercy killing and be happy at the outcome of the trial.

Regardless of ones legal or moral leanings, this story certainly is gripping in its honesty, showing both sides of the dilemma without flinching.",1166054400,13,2137,4.977591036414566

The story of the poor and semi-literate Ward brothers is touching and engrossing, despite the squalor in which they lived, and this early 90's legal case is a significant study in cultural assumptions and regional justice.

One of the brothers (Delbert) is accused of murder after another brother (Bill) dies, but the shameful attempt to railroad Delbert isn't nearly as interesting as the brothers themselves. And Bill's death isn't as mysterious as the wonder of how any of them survived at all in such surroundings. What sort of upbringing did they have anyway, and how did they come to live like this? An exploration of their background would have been helpful, had it been done properly. Instead, the filmmakers follow the Wards around playing ""20 Questions"" by making inappropriate 'busybody' type queries. As if the poor shnooks weren't being exploited enough. And as usual, the 'liner notes' on the DVD box are rather misleading. Still, it's worth viewing but HEADS UP; please avert your eyes during the pig slaughter. Despite another amazon reviewer's allusion of it as metaphor to the abuse sustained by the Ward brothers, I found it utterly unnecessary.

521196,5,6302806577,"This one of the most profoundly disturbing movies I have ever seen.  The documentary details the events surrounding the trial of Delbert Ward for the alleged murder of his brother Bill, two of four elderly brothers living as near-hermits in a tiny shack near the rural township of Munnsville, New York.  After an autopsy revealed that Bill might not have died under natural circumstances, Delbert was questioned and signed a confession, though he might not have been mentally competent to do so.
Initially, the viewer responds to the sheer oddness of the Ward brothers, their way of life, their extraordinary social isolation, and the way of life they have carved for themselves, which was utterly unlike that of the rest of American society.  At times, one feels one is taking a vacation trip along the edge of the abyss.  Gradually, however, the film takes on far more nuanced and subtle aspects in relating their story to the town as a whole, and their growing support of one of their residents being judged and accused by outsiders.
This is not a movie that clears up any mysteries or comes to any firm conclusions.  Filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky start off with a perplexing possible crime and end in a confusing fog.  One doesn't know quite what to think (though a possible mercy killing of Bill, who was ill at the time of his death, seems a possibility).

He's one of four equally simple, bearded, unbathed, elderly brothers in Munnsville, New York (population 500) who raise cows, live in a shack, and rarely see outsiders.  When one brother dies, Delbert is accused of murder. Rumors fly that a confession was coerced and the people of Munnsville band together to help Delbert.  This incredibly compassionate documentary reveals the morality of the rural community and the souls of the three surviving brothers. Highest recommendation.",1060041600,6,688,5.351851851851852
521219,5,6302806577,"It's impossible to praise ""Brother's Keeper"" too much. Not only a superb documentary, it's one of the best movies of any genre I've seen. Even after a half-dozen viewings, it holds up.

""Brother's Keeper"" is one of those rare films in which everything perfectly falls into place. It's not just the documentation of an odd murder trial in a forgotten part of the US, but a multi-leveled story about -- well, just about everything.

One of those many things is a cautionary tale of how the legal system can and will do _anything_ to convict _somebody_, whether or not a crime has been committed. It's a perfect real-life example of why The Police and the Prosecutors Cannot Be Trusted.

For me, the best thing about ""Brother's Keeper"" is the way a town of what ""we"" would consider moronic hicks displays a level of intelligence, common sense, and compassion that ""educated"" folk rarely, if ever, approach.

""Brother's Keeper"" also has one of the most heart-rending scenes you'll ever see. Keep the Kleenex handy.

The DVD is an improvement over the LaserDisk. It's slightly sharper (though not much -- the source material is 16mm film) and the colors are brighter and less muddy. Contrary to some listings, this is neither a widescreen film, nor is the sound stereo.

I've seen ""Brother's Keeper"" rated variously as G or R (!!!), but it has no official MPAA rating. Parents concerned about what their children view should note that a live pig is butchered in graphic detail. There are also several scenes covering the police's invention of a mind-bogglingly preposterous ""motive"" for Delbert murdering William. For those who haven't seen the film, I won't reveal it, but it's something most parents would prefer not to discuss with pre-teens.

Absolutely, unreservedly recommended.

Note: In browsing the other reviews, I noted that some viewers tend to see what they want to see. Although it's not clear whether the Ward brothers are illiterate (even if there was no school to attend, it's hard to believe their parents didn't teach them to read and write), it is nevertheless true that they are NOT mentally defective, NOT the product of inbreeding, NOT ""hicks"", and NOT ""stupid"". (Delbert's low IQ is the result of a lack of education, not a lack of ""intelligence"".) Nor are they poor, or ""outcasts"" (though, as one member of the community comments, their body odor renders them unsuitable companions in a restaurant). If the Ward brothers have a problem, it's that they are naive in the ways of the world, which is hardly a reason for condemnation.",1059868800,79,2550,4.900232018561485
521220,5,6302806577,"A near impossible documentary to categorize, this touching film focuses on the alleged murder of Bill Ward by his brother Delbert, a plain dairy farmer in the central New York community of Munnsville. His defense becomes a rallying cry to his neighbors as he becomes a target of speculation, abuse and manipulation. At times it seems this story is about the exploitation of country-folk by the media, or the encroachment of the city on rural communities like Munnsville, or the importance of community activism in the judicial system, or abuses of power by an unsympathetic police department. But at its core, this is a yarn about four brothers, hermits, living a nearly extinct lifestyle among cows and hayfields, knowing only each other in their day-to-day life.
Berlinger and Sinofsky play with their audience. Lulling us into a false sense of knowledge, we casually apply stereotypes to the people of Munnsville and then, by watching how they respond to this crisis, slowly we are forced to conclude that, like the media circus that followed the Ward case for so many months, we are as wrong in our preconceptions and as quick to leap to judgment about these people as all those who've done them wrong. The people of Munnsville are not simple. Or stupid. They chose their way of life, they did not fall into it.
Despite which, the Ward brothers are, at times, seen as sad; illiterate and deprived of human contact as they are. When Lyman Ward testifies on his brother's behalf, he shakes and is unable to speak because people make him nervous. This scene is so touching - it is to the directors credit that they were deft enough just to let the camera record his trembling in silence. That image stays with the audience long after the film ends.

Brother's Keeper is more compelling than any fictional drama, painting broad strokes on a very small canvas. The story is personal, compassionate, and powerful.",1017360000,13,1911,4.844036697247707
521221,5,6302806577,"Now, the arena of film-making is highly competitive.  Everyone knows that.  Kids grow up idolizing famous directors, producers, etc., and we're all pretty tired of hearing about it.  (Don't you just wish that a film would soon come to erase the competition and render any further film-making unnecessary?)  That's why I was so thrilled when I watched Brother's Keeper.  For, this is The definitive film of the past quarter-century.  Forsooth, the greatest documentary of all time!  And for this reason American folk should praise God that such a film has been made, for it means that the film industry as we know it will soon collapse, having come to recognize that film-making no longer holds value after the making of such a perfect movie as Brother's Keeper.
Brother's Keeper is not only both heart-rending and uplifting, but it is at the same time a harbinger of terrific things to come.  Namely, the signaling of the film-industry's long-awaited demise and the gradual transfer of it's power into the sweaty, calloused hands of Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky.

521225,5,6302806577,"This is the story of the murder trail of Delbert Ward, one of four outcast elderly brothers in the  town of Munnsville, New York, population 500, not far from Onieda.  The brothers lived together in a dilapidated shack,  raised cows and rarely came to town.  The didn't bathe or shave much and  were generally outcasts.
And then, one of the brothers died and his  brother was accused of his murder.  The town banded together to help him as  it seemed as if he were coerced in confessing.  He had an IQ of 63 and  could neither read nor write. The other brothers were equally as  simple.
The trial got national media attention, and even Connie Chung  came out to interview Delbert and the people of the town.  How this all  effected everyone concerned is painstakingly recorded in this  documentary.
Us city-folk rarely get such a penetrating glimpse into the  lives of a rural community and the townspeople, and the three surviving  brothers all shine with humanity.  We get to know the people. We get to see  the trial.  We hold our breath during testimony.  Rumors fly.  The case  becomes absurd.  All filmed with utmost compassion.
This is not a fun  movie to watch but it rings with a universal truth and the viewer comes  away with an enriched sense of humanity.",952128000,11,1267,4.619909502262443
