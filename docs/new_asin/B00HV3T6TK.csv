8636251,3,B00HV3T6TK,"""210 days of Captivity""a 14-minute-long DVD video producedby Graham Messick for""60 Minutes"" a television news-program. This is a brief, condensed story of Mr. Matthew Schrier, an American photo-journalist, whocrossed the Turkey border into Syria in late Dec. 2012 to report on that country's civil war between the repressive Shiite-sectarian regime of Pres. Bashar al-Assad and the mostlySunni militias trying to overthrow his dictatorship. Very quickly he was captured and turned over to anti-Assad jihadi rebels, who believing him to be an American CIA spy, tortured and held him captive for seven months before he escaped his tormentors. This is a short 14-minute-long interview video wherein he recounts his tales of his horrid captivity. During his imprisonment, for a while he shared a cell with another U.S. captive journalist, Theo Padnos [a.k.a. Peter Curtis] -- who was later released.  (At the time of this review he had announced that he hoped to soon release a book detailing his harrowing captivity. Until his book is released, see other Wikipedia articles for more details.)",1475712000,,1089,5.368421052631579
