It's one that I (and I'm sure he too)  want to see over and over again!!  I'd be unbelievably grateful for any help you can give me to find it, thanks so very much!  Janet",1449878400,,347,3.9
8453486,3,B0052329GS,Great movie and one I wish would be remastered. But this is a copy of a play on AMC and it is really bad including some static. But better than no movie.,1361923200,6,153,3.8125
8453487,5,B0052329GS,"After years of trying to get a copy of this movie one findly became available.  This film was produced in 1941 and depected what was required to become a pilot in what was at that time a part of thr United States Army and then was later make into a separate branch of the military service.  I had not seen this picture for over 71 years and was excited to review it again.  The Visual and audio of my copy was in very poor condition and the process used to capture the film was to copy it from a late-night showing on a television set.

You will notice that I gave it a 5-star rating because it was a very good movie.  The acting was extremely fine and with the exception of Vernica Lake, the film was as wonderful as it was when I was thirteen years old.  I didn't mind that Ms. Lake's performance lacked talent, I have always enjoyed Ms Lake for reasons not related to any acting skill.  We today are spoiled with extraordinary sound, color, and advanced technology in our newer (and restored) movies and comparison of the technology of then and now seems painful to consider them together.  I am grateful to anyone who made the return of this film possible.  This was make available through Amazon and I would gladly recommend having a copy if you really like the show.",1349481600,6,1272,4.3559322033898304
