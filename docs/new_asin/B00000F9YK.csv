1210085,5,B00000F9YK,"Kept Husbands has a good plot which moves along nicely; it held my attention every step of the way and the acting is very convincing. The cinematography is pretty good; and the choreography shines in crowd scenes and scenes at the steel mill factory. This is definitely one of the better films out there from Alpha Video.

When the film starts, we quickly meet some members of a fabulously wealthy family in the steel business. There's Mr. Arthur Parker (Robert McWade) and his wife Henrietta (Florence Roberts); we also meet their snooty and spoiled brat daughter Dorothea (Dorothy Mackaill). Arthur announces to everyone's shock and disgust that he's invited a low level ""steel boss"" to dinner; he explains to them that the young man is a hero who saved three lives in a fire at the steel mill--and he even refused a reward check! Despite the fact that Arthur thinks highly of the young man, Dorothea and her mother believe that he's too ""common"" to even eat at the same table with them. Henrietta carries on as if she were about to have a heart attack! However, when Richard ""Dick"" Brunton (Joel McCrea) shows up for dinner, they are impressed with him for having been such a great football player just a few years back.

But there's more. Dorothea, much to everyone's surprise, can't take her eyes off Dick at the dinner table. He has impeccable manners, too; and she vows to her father that she'll be marrying him within four weeks! Arthur doesn't really believe Dorothea can pull that off; but Dorothea makes it her business to visit Dick just about every day at the steel mill and eventually she proposes to him! He accepts, too.

But then things start to happen that could threaten their relationship; Dick doesn't want to be a ""kept"" husband like Llewllyn Post (Freeman Wood) is being kept by his rich wife Henrietta (Clara Kimball Young). Henrietta ruined Llewllyn's drive to become a great architect; and Dick doesn't want Dorothea to ruin his ambitions, either. After a lavish honeymoon of many months (and several cables to the states asking father for yet more money), Dick sees that Dorothea is gradually ruining his ambition to truly earn his keep at the company. It soon becomes a tug-of-war as to which one of them really wears the pants. Dick becomes even more uncomfortable after he is ""promoted"" to 3rd vice president of Arthur's steel company.

What happens next can be anyone's guess. Dick is told by his father-in-law there's a big sales job to score a contract on a bridge--it's the biggest gamble the company will ever make. Arthur wants Dick to go to Saint Louis to sell the plan and get the contract. Trouble is, Dorothea throws a temper tantrum and tries anything she can to make Dick stay--will she succeed? What about all the money they need from Arthur to keep up that extravagant lifestyle--will Arthur eventually stop giving them money? Will Dick even stay with Dorothea or will they divorce? Watch and find out! Look also for excellent performances from Ned Sparks as Hughie Hanready and Mary Carr as Dick's mother.

Kept Husbands is a great film that deals with issues that still crop up in our times; but it must have been somewhat scandalous in its day. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who like classic movies would do well to get this film.",1243209600,8,3317,4.712068965517242
1210086,4,B00000F9YK,"KEPT HUSBANDS is a solid telling of an often-told story: spoiled rich girl sees good-looking poor hunk she wants, marries him with predictable marital difficulties down the road deciding who ""wears the pants"" in the family.  When steel heiress Dorothy Mackaill's father invites a much-admired young worker home to dinner, Mackaill and her snooty mother are aghast that someone from the lower classes will be dining with them.  Playgirl Dot's attitude changes though when she sees the man in question is hunky Joel McCrea - and when she learns he is the football hero she swooned over in the papers five years earlier, she's out to land him as a husband within the next month.  Of course she is successful, getting daddy to promote him to an executive position that is pays a fortune and is pretty much a non-existant job, but not before their lavish honeymoon in Europe where Dottie repeatedly wires Pops for more money and buys $10,000 furs without much of a second thought.  Virtuous McCrea can't help but wonder if he is on the way to becoming a counterpart to Mackaill's society friend Clara Kimball Young, who married and emasculated a promising archetect and made him basically her hand-maiden and now treats him with less affection than her pampered pekennese.

This is a smooth little drama that is predictable but goes down that well-worn path very effectively.  Dorothy Mackaill, a fairly big star of the day for a period, does very well as the willful heiress and Joel McCrea, in one of his first films, is very dashing and appealing as the honorable man of modest means.  Silent movie fans will want to check this out for rare major talking roles from well-known character actress Mary Carr (playing McCrea's mother) and former star Clara Kimball Young.  Ned Sparks provides comic relief as the deadpan border at Carr's home who always peppers his comments with famous phrases, often slightly mangled.

This Alpha print is very good to excellent with some imperfections and blotches as well as the occasional broken-film repair with a quick snippet missing.",1236729600,19,2069,4.922413793103448
1210087,2,B00000F9YK,"I became curious about Dorothy Mackaill after thoroughly enjoying Mick LaSalle's overview text entitled COMPLICATED WOMEN:  SEX AND POWER IN PRE-CODE HOLLWOOD.  By the time she made a Bulldog Drummond programmer a few years later, she was okay but no blockbuster.  KEPT HUSBANDS, however, illustrates the '20s approach to talkies by trying too hard while standing within range of hidden microphones.  McCrea is easy-going and natural with the ""new"" medium, and Ned Sparks is happily Ned Sparks; but Dorothy is still getting her sea legs.

The lower stars rating is due to a bad soundtrack (fuzzy throb competes with the dialogue).  This also happened on another item I bought a couple of weeks ago and amazon/the vendor were most cooperative.  But this time it seems to be the cheapness of the product packaging itself, and there are only so many times one can, as Mark Twain said, ""sit on a hot stove.""

In sum, the film itself is a vintage but minor pre-Code shocker (rich girl aggresses to obtain and control intelligent blue-collar hunk), not worth the investment when having to compete with the technology of delivery.",1156118400,,1123,4.967914438502674

1210120,5,B00000F9YK,"Just a little gem of a movie that captures an era brilliantly and imparts several moral lessons with the main theme of respect. The wife, who is a good hearted yet spoiled rich girl, falls for a handsome, intelligent, ambitious but poor young man who works at her father's steel company. She makes fun of him when her father invites him to dinner after he saves some people at the company during an accident. He, however, accepts it all gracefully and with good humor and she makes her mind up right after the dinner that she will have him for a husband. He tells his mother that he would never marry someone like her and says she is about as useful as a kitten (the nickname he will use for her later). She woos him and proposes to him and he, after a bit of a struggle, accepts. The story settles into a series of battles - large and small - in which the husband and wife each try to make their own interests dominant. The story resolves with the marriage on the brink of divorce and finally they both realize that they would rather give in than give up. The give in to the other a little bit and then both are willing to give in completely. It's a very heart warming film. Supporting roles are all very entertaining, as well, especially the poor man's kindhearted mother and her dead-pan boarder, played by Mary Carr and Ned Sparks, respectively.",1469923200,,1349,4.4
1210121,4,B00000F9YK,"Cheesy old-time romance with bad acting, but the storyline is still sweet.  What can I say - I love a good old romance!",1469318400,,119,4.173913043478261
1210122,4,B00000F9YK,"Probably only deserves three stars, but Joel McCrae is so classically handsome, and the pre-Hayes Office atmosphere so interesting, I will give it four.  The acting, alas, is pretty wooden -- as are the writing and the script.

The story is a stale woman's-film cliche:  rich girl falls for beautiful poor boy, wins him, marries him;  she tries to change him, then sees the error of her ways when he leaves her (he wants to be his own man), and she sets out to win him back.  Not a basis for a great film, of course, but the wonderfully extravagent 30's sets and other nice touches, like the trains of that period, are very enjoyable.  The end result is that the film is entirely watchable, especially with Joel McCrae -- one of Hollywood's most beautiful and memorable men -- in his absolute physical prime.

The film transfer is not bad, but not great, either.  It's a bit fuzzy, without the great crystal clarity of a remastered B&W film, but it's not as bad as some Alpha videos I've seen.

Basically, this is an interesting film artifact.",1466380800,2,1043,4.564516129032258

1210125,3,B00000F9YK,"I am typically a fan of the ""Poor American Aristocracy"" movies of 30's so this might be better described at 2.5 stars.

Pros
-Young Joel Mcrea shows he has screen presence
-story makes sense (keeping in mind the genre)
-Most of the moral of the story is good (Live on your own, marriage requires sacrifice)
-Budget was good (no underdone scenery or effects)

Cons
-Young Joel Mccrea his acting is definitely wooden and at times a little painful
-The Moral of ""Wives need to make sacrifices to keep their husbands"" (lets make it go both ways)
-a few character actors were too much for the seriousness of the movie

Overall, if you like the year and the genre it is worth watching",1457568000,4,678,4.540983606557377

It was so cool seeing the attitudes of the day, especially the way the wealth and attitudes towards the rich and poorer classes was so sharply delineated.  I also loved the industrial scenes.  When you think about it, although we're looking backwards around 90 years, not much has changed regarding the things people still have to do to live.  I also loved the very Art Deco sets from the period, the dresses and the flash back int time.  Joel McCrae was really handsome and great and played the role of honest, upstanding straight-shooter through-out.  A real feel good movie.",1403308800,2,605,4.769230769230769

7908066,2,B00000F9YK,"I wanted to like it, but I found it hard to. The plot was a little boring, due to lack of originality. Basically, its over an hour of a spoiled rich girl draining her new husband's bank account while using the fancy things she buys and big parties she throws, to cheat on him. He leaves her for work, she throws a fit, he insists on going (His boss is her father. She puts him in a horrible position from day one.), she throws a fit, he decides to come back and he catches her in a lie and finds out that she is ""cheating"".  I found this hard to watch because her whining and bad behavior were just cringeworthy. I think the plot was doomed from the beginning, but I gave it a chance anyway. That was my mistake!  I don't recommend this movie, although its issues lie mostly in the plot and the lead female's incessant whining and pouting. If I wanted to watch someone throw a fit for two hours, I would babysit someone's kids! I would hope to get more pleasure out of watching classic films, but this one let me down. Two stars for classic charm, that's all that saved this movie.

7908069,5,B00000F9YK,"A very young Joel McCrea steps right out of the 1930s screen in this film, with all the handsome boyish sexually energized star power you might find on the modern screen. This man, wow. He's a tall drink of water.

In 'The Palm Beach Story,' he takes Claudette Colbert in his arms and you know he is going to have sex with her because he can't resist kissing her and she can't resist his kisses. Same here, with the young Dorothy Mackaill. He's so attractive that his young man could be dressed just a big differently and he'd be in a clothing ad in Vanity Fair. He's bursting with health, strength, and testosterone.

If you do venture to watch 'Kept Husbands,' be aware that there are some stiffly acted scenes close to the beginning of the film as the characters set up the premises of the story. But soon, the pace picks up and the actors seem more modern than the 30s style and dialogue.
