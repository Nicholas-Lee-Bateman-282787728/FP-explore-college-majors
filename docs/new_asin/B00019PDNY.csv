1982889,5,B00019PDNY,"I've been a P&T fan for years, seen them onstage many times and met them several times. I love the way they present themselves, be it in the format of a live performance, in print (they have several books out), on the web, or in this series. I watched the entire first season on Showtime and am anxiously awaiting the DVD release just to have the extras (and good quality recordings of the episodes, which I TiVoed the first time around then archived to VHS).
Many others seem to pick the environmental episode as a keystone in the series, but I have to say my favorite was the episode on alien abductions. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the show yet, but I consider that one hands-down to be the funniest in the entire season, especially Penn yelling ""A foot doctor?"" and the woman happily looking over a device she thinks is an alien scientific tool. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you will when you see the DVD!
A worthwhile addition to anyone's DVD collection, skeptics and comedy fans alike... as long as you have an open mind.",1077753600,8,1056,4.448453608247423
1982890,4,B00019PDNY,"I have very little gripes about this television show. Penn and Teller always pick interesting topics and they consisently have a well-rounded presentation for each show. Penn's comments are usually funny and each episode is an invitation for thought, debate, and careful consideration.

My only gripe, really, is that sometimes Penn's rants run a bit too long.  He's funny and what you see is clearly the result of a skeptic trying to survive in a world full of chiropracters and feng shui, but it feels like the show would be better served by more debate and interviews.  Of course, this is a minor complaint---a better gripe would be that the show is only 30 minutes long.  Each topic could easily pad out to at least a 60 minute show, if not a full-fledged documentary.

In my previous review of this season, I mentioned that I was annoyed that P & T use Bjorn Lomborg as a reference in their Environmental Hysteria. (And for that reason I deducted a star from the rating.  I'd like to change that, but all I seem to be able to edit is my review itself.)  I've since then changed my opinion on this---having learned more about Lomborg's work over the last year and half, and having learned more about the criticism aimed toward him, I feel that there was no reason he should not have been featured on the episode.  ""Environmental Hysteria"" is an excellent episode---surprisingly, Penn is much calmer in this episode than in any other!

I also highly recommend the episodes on bottled water, second-hand smoke, and creationism. Not only are these some of the funniest episodes, but they are also the most alarming, controversial, and thought-provoking of the bunch.",1076284800,23,1667,4.780487804878049
1982891,5,B00019PDNY,I really cannot wait for this. I never had Showtime but after I mentioned to my friend about how much I would like to strange John Edward he came to me with this show and I was blown off my rocker. It's one of the greatest shows to hit the air in a very long time and I'm glad it's been picked up for a second season. Although I have only seen 3 or 4 episodes I'm sure I'll love this whole thing. I love debunking the myths of the liberal liars it's just so much fun and Penn & Teller present nothing but the best.,1075766400,5,514,3.858490566037736
1982892,5,B00019PDNY,"Penn and Teller hosting an informational no-bull television show, is like Siegfried and Roy hosting a Dr. Phil type show.  These two performers are able to pull this off though, and near-flawlessly at that.  They fully explain both sides of the argument that they are discussing, pick the most realistic side, and fully exploit the other, incorrect and inate side.  Episodes such as ""Environmentalists"" truly acknowledge its great informational facilities.  This is truly a good buy if you are a fan of the show, if you like Penn & Teller, or if you are a realist in this sugar coated world.",1075075200,8,591,4.821782178217822

It is only when P&T tackle issues like second-hand smoke and GMO foods that the show becomes interesting.

1982901,5,B00019PDNY,"You have no heart or soul if you don't like this show. It's hilarious and educational at the same time. I can understand some people not liking the name of the show, but come on. For some reason, Penn Jillette reminds me of a doorknob.",1333411200,,235,4.2444444444444445
1982902,3,B00019PDNY,"I had a free pass to Showtime and ran across this show by accident, so I decided to jump in for more.  At first I was enthralled.  Penn is extremely intelligent, charismatic and they throw in a lot of humor.  But the more I watched these episodes I found them to be very one sided, with one or two extremists as the enemy, and calm, level-headed protagonists championing their cause.

For every argument they make, they have a pro and a con explanation.  The pro side is a person that they never make fun of, nor allow them to hang themself on any issue.  The con person is always someone from the far extreme.  It's as if they try to find the one person from that camp that is so far out there that they could actually be austrosized from that group, but that doesn't stop Penn and Teller from making them the representative.  So here we have a one sided, to the extreme, argument that proves that whatever it is that Penn and Teller don't believe in can't actually be true.  A great example of this is the argument against modified food and organic food.  Penn and Teller choose as their champion an individual that has created enough food to sustain over a billion people.  A real hero, doing hero's work.  Therefore, he has to be correct on everything he says.  The antagonists?  A group of individuals that only eat raw vegetables (because fire alters the chemicals in the plant), so much so that they use lettuce as a ""taco"" shell.  How can the people against modified food win this argument?  They can't because the cards are stacked against them.

Now, with all that being said, there are some arguments that I actually believe Penn and Teller are correct. For instance, the global warming episode features a little segment where a petition is passed around to ban dihydrogen monoxide, also known as water.  It's advertised as ""being in our rivers, streams, oceans and it falls from the sky.  It's in everything you drink and most of the things you eat.""  People, according to them, were dying to sign this petition, and they exposed the fanaticism that accompanies the environmental activist movement.  However, since this is a television show, and it's edited, could they have possible just shown only the people that signed the petition?

The whole point of the show is to not take everything at literal, face value.  To be skeptical of everything until you can't scientifically disprove it to be anything but genuine.  They've done a very good job, because now I do that with whatever comes out of their mouths (well, Penn's at least).",1329177600,3,2547,4.633928571428571
1982910,5,B00019PDNY,This would be a great network show and important for the general public to see. We all need to be better critical thinkers. I love  how this show cuts through all the layers of BS and gets to the truth in a very entertaining way. The only problem is the crude language. Penn is constantly using the F word. I can handle it but my wife gets upset and I have to turn it off and finish it by myself later. I would love to show it to my kids but there's no way. Would be great if they put out an edited for Network TV version.,1277683200,,522,3.878504672897196
1982911,5,B00019PDNY,"This is not unbiased journalism. I know that Penn and Teller do pick and chose facts to suit their purpose, but the shows are really funny. The second-hand smoke episode was a little disturbing to me because I do want to believe that it is dangerous. Oh, well. I would buy this dvd again.",1267056000,,288,4.351851851851852
1982912,4,B00019PDNY,"This show is pretty cool, yes they are skeptics and make their opinions well known, but why shouldn't they? Christians have had centuries of giving their opinions, while the skeptics have kept back for fear of ruined lives. Now its time for the all skeptics to make their opinions known. Although Penn & Teller are skeptics, they do try to get both sides of the argument. I like the expose feel of the show. One of the cool bonus features of this show was this interview that they did with James Randi.

In some episodes like the one on environmental hysteria, I felt embarrassed for the environmental activists who didn't have logical answers for the most basic questions. Its amazing that they wouldn't ask themselves such questions, and these are people at the top running these things. Its ridiculous, if they can't take themselves seriously then why should anyone else? I'm glad that P & T expose hacks like that.

Anyway check them out. I think that as skeptical as these guys are, they also have hearts and I think they do a great service to expose the charlatans.",1219622400,,1071,4.661375661375661
1982913,4,B00019PDNY,"I could see points in many episodes. The thing I wish folks to keep in mind as they watch the supposed hidden camera shots and the enormous amounts footage of people supporting P & T's point of view is that even P & T edit stuff out so it sounds more in thier favor. No, they don't present the whole truth and nothing but the truth. But... what they do show is entertaining, and some grains of truth are there. Just keep your head on as you watch and don't get brainwashed by them, either. The Creationsism one I noticed however had a lot of folks who were against creationism, bashing it. Im all for debate but debaters need to tell you why their side is valid, not just bash their opponent. You could convince someone their opponent sucks but that doesnt mean they themselves don't suck also. I needed some positives with those negatives. It also smelled of segregationalism. P & T were saying Creationism has no place in the classroom/ society. I don't see why a view is more acceptable than another and why both views should not be allowed presentation. Creationism got all our forefathers through thousands more years than evolutionism has. I also don't believe that Creationists are ""out to do away with science"". Creationists do not say science does not exist nor do they wish do put it into extinction. They just want thier voice heard also. (How scary!) Apparently, Orvell was right - ""all are created equal, but some are more equal than others."" You don't like political commercials were all they do is mud sling other candidates, how is this any better?",1200787200,4,1564,4.60931899641577
1982914,2,B00019PDNY,"These guys produce a funny, creative show but their arguments are pretty lame and their logic is more sensational than thoughtful.  They start off on any subject with an opinion in mind, then search for and massage evidence to support that conclusion.  The most egregious example of this, to me, is their show on AA--they pick a loud and articulate woman to support their view and then a meek and nervous guy to speak for the opposition.  That kind of cherry-picking is typical, like when they use outtakes of an environmentalist stumbling over her words to make her seem poorly informed and overly emotional, then cut to a slick guy at the CATO institute without explaining its right-wing nature or corporate funding (they call it ""libertarian"").  Even when I agree with them, such as in the case of the Creationism episode, I find myself annoyed at how they load their debate in favor of their pre-arrived conclusions.

Maybe it's obvious that a couple of TV magicians are in no position to argue anything--but they are superior showmen and they know how to convince their audience regardless of how stupid and shallow their arguments are.  And being on tv itself gives them the imprimatur of authority. While I find them entertaining and enjoyable, I just hope they stay on Showtime with a miniscule audience--moving to a bigger forum would just lower American discourse even further than it already is.  The world doesn't neeed a secular Ann Coulter.",1188432000,16,1454,4.8861788617886175
1982915,5,B00019PDNY,"Penn and Teller's BS is one of my favorite shows on television. They cover everything from religion and politics to circumcision and Mount Rushmore. Every episode teaches me something new and interesting, and is absolutely hillarious in the process.",1183766400,2,249,5.410256410256411
1982916,4,B00019PDNY,"Penn & Teller made a name for themselves in the early years of their career together by performing entertaining (sometimes stunning) magical tricks ... and then telling everyone how they did it.  Although the pair are avowed hedonists (with an epicurian slant), they are also hardcore teetotalers, eschewing the traditional anesthetics of alcohol, nicotine, and even caffeine in favor of, say, sex and food.  Libertarians with the same view of politics that can be found in your typical episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Park/dp/B000KLQUMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Park</a>, Penn & Teller are big fans of the pursuit of knowledge and happiness, as long as it isn't at the expense of someone else's own pursuit.  It is this attitude more than anything else that prompts their myth-busting show, and although many episodes come across as mean-spirited, that's because these fellows have little patience for exploitation and willful ignorance.

This three disc set covers all thirteen episodes of the first season, where the foul-mouthed prestidigitarians expose (among other things) sham psychics, the bug-eyed culture of alien abductees, bottled water, the self-help industry, and environmentalism.  The episodes are by turns enlightening, informative, thought-provoking, and disturbing.

And when these guys aren't convincing, they are at least entertaining.  Some of their targets are admittedly soft (if I promised to buy him an extra controller for his Xbox, my eight year old nephew could probably debunk Ouiji Boards in ten minutes).  Others are just excuses to perform silly and titillating ""experiments"" that are mostly about embarrassing the participants or showing off mostly-naked women (see the entire episode about sex).  Still, this IS a television show we're talking about, and not rigorous scientific explorations.  A little sensationalism isn't unwarranted.

Along the same lines, there's something to be said for SOME impartiality.  Penn & Teller pretend to approach each subject with some degree of openness, but it's quite obvious that no one needs to convince these guys that they're already right.  It's not hard, when you're the one calling the shots (or, in this case, edits), to make your competitors seem like manipulative idiots, and there are numerous occasions where Penn & Teller do just that, thumbing through their arguments like a couple of stand-ups who are only pretending that they don't know the punch-line to the joke they're in the midst of telling.

I don't want to harp.  After all, I like the show.  And I like Penn & Teller.  And, more than any of that, I like the spirit in which the show is filmed, the idea that people are too easily pulled by emotional strings and they need to be slapped straight every once in a while, if not with some hilarious side-commentary, then at least with some simple logical application.  Along those lines, these guys do a good job of clearly presenting their side of each argument, but I'd say they aren't as skilled at presenting the opposite side.  I empathize with their anger when they encounter fraudulent ""doctors"" and ""scientists"" who milk both the hearts and wallets of vulnerable fools, but I see a little milking going on with Penn & Teller, too.  Theirs is just a bit more subtle and not nearly as self-interested.

Intelligent mockery, crude comedy, and a little explotative sleight-of-hand: these guys have been doing this stuff for years, and doing it very very well.  It's just, this time around, they're giving away everyone else's secrets, instead of their own.",1179273600,9,3621,5.349206349206349
1982917,4,B00019PDNY,Very good dvd set. I love the premise but like all other opinions that others have I can not agree with 100% of what the call BS to be actual BS. All in all a great buy.,1178928000,,169,3.5945945945945947

I sent them back, but have not recieved any indication that you have recieved them.",1178928000,2,270,4.113207547169812
1982919,4,B00019PDNY,"Penn and Teller tackle many subjects, including bottled water, creationism, ESP and alternative medicine.  Even though they don't go into specific formal rebuttals of everything, usually there's science and research to back them up.  The ""Eat This!"" episode was the best of the lot I think, where they talk about a man you've never heard of that's saved a billion people from starvation, and how it's rather selfish to protest the use of proven-safe GM crops in developing countries.

However this made it all the more painful to watch the last episode.  They completely miss the mark when going after global warming.  They ignore the arguments stemming from ice core samples and the vast array of peer reviewed scientific papers that all use different methods to come to the conclusion that the world has been warming up and will continue to warm up.  And at a rate far beyond that of any natural heating that's occurred in the past.  The only way in which they disagree is exactly how much, and even the lowest estimate is uncomfortably high.  Using a libertarian think tank rather than a peer-reviewed journal as a source is rather dubious.  It's rather sad that they've fallen for the ""scientists don't agree"" line here.

However it's overall an entertaining and enlightening set of DVDs.  Keep your skeptic hat on for the last episode and you should be okay.",1168300800,9,1363,4.857142857142857

I've recently found this series after my deconversion and let me just say that I love it. I love the way P & T call out on the bs that seems rampant in life. Yeah this show is for entertainment but they also manage to present the facts in such a way that they won't bore you to death, and yes they're a tough crowd, but they dare to do what other hosts on tv refuse to do and that is actually refreshing.",1164844800,3,567,4.071428571428571

They employ the same techniques they blast as B.S. to make their points: questionable ""experts"", misdirection, and even petty name calling. I have no doubt that most of the things they investigate really are B.S., but to say that Penn and Teller ""prove"" them wrong is stretching it. If you want to have a good laugh and see some wonderfully pathetic examples of human gullibility, watch this series. If you want to see well thought-out, unbiased skepticism, this isn't it.",1162252800,11,632,4.807339449541284
1982924,4,B00019PDNY,"Well, folks, Penn & Teller take `em all on in this one - spiritualist, environmentalists, anti-smoking campaigners, alien abductees, and the list, it seems, gets carried on to a second season's worth of shows.

 I like Penn & Teller's aggressive style and willingness to take on any and all.  There's a sour delight to be had watching an episode designed to outrage intelligent designers and then later one that'll outrage Green Peacers, or those who are convinced of the harmful effects of second-hand smoke.  There sure aren't any sacred cows in this barn.

 I really wanted to love this series, and for the most part I did indeed like it very much.  The only problem I had, and it carried through from one episode to the next, was something mentioned in a Penn & Teller interview with Randi - their spiritual father and role model - on the bonus disk.  As Penn explains in the opening episode, they use the word ""bullh*t"" because they can't use words like `frauds' or `charlatans' without getting into a messy legal situation.  But it's frauds and charlatans they go after here, and they don't blunt the attack.  However, in the Randi interview they agree that the people who are duped by these charlatans are `victims,' and should be treated as such.  If someone close to you has died, for instance, you're probably vulnerable to someone who claims to communicate with the dead.  The unscrupulous actor here is the one making the supernatural claims, the guy who's profiting from another person's grief.  At times, though, the alien abductees, or the bottled water drinkers - yeah, there's an episode about bottled water - are held up to ridicule.  I was expecting a certain amount of superficiality and a lack of depth.  You can't handle the evolutionist/creationist battle in 25-television minutes without leaving out the finer debate points of both sides.  It's cool when they take off after someone who seeks to profit from spiritual readings, for instance, but sometimes P & T cross the line and ridicule the `victims', as well.  And that just comes off as bullying.  Still, if you're able to squirm though those bits, and want to be entertained rather than educated (or convinced), this is an enjoyable set.",1158364800,2,2217,4.851063829787234
1982925,5,B00019PDNY,"Penn & Teller: BS is simply addictive.

If you're like me, you see all kinds of unbelievable, well, B.S. in this world and just shake your head at the people who make it happen.

Supposedly talking to the dead, hollistic medicines, alien abductions, armageddon, feng shui, intelligent design, ESP, recycling. These are only some of the topics that Penn & Teller not only tackle, but brutally beat down on their show.

Penn & Teller are obviously expert debunkers. They take into account the potential skepticism of the viewer and, in most cases, prove beyond a doubt that the topic they are explaining is B.S. The funny thing is, the people speaking in defense of what P&T are debunking usually bury themselves. They have a lot to say, but all it takes are a few wry comments from the ever entertaining Penn Jillette to show the truth of what they're saying.

Above all else, this show is amazingly unmerciful in their debunking. They are fearless and steadfast in their beliefs, but they never lose their humanity.

1982939,5,B00019PDNY,"There is much to disagree about with Penn and Teller on this collection.  Why then 5 stars?

1.  Penn and Teller are consistently entertaining.  I've been a fan for at least 15 years.  Even if you don't agree with them, you're guaranteed at least a chuckle.

2.  I wound up getting angry several times.  I then thought about why it pissed me off.  I think we can all stand to be a little challenged when it comes to our own strongly held beliefs.  While I might not have changed my mind on the issues (although I have tempered mine a bit on the second hand smoke...), I at least didn't dismiss them out of hand.

3.  James Randi.  OK, I don't completely swallow his anti-mystical dogma, he DOES puts his money where his mouth is, and I find that refreshing (see the James Randi Foundation for details...)

4.  Some really deserving people get skewered.

5.  They're obviously not pandering to a demographic.  Liberal, conservative, libertarian...there's sure to be things to agree with and things to be irritated about.  It's like arguing with a friend over beers...friends who are passionate about the things that they rant about, who you can curse out then go home, sleep it off and go out with again NEXT Saturday.

1982945,3,B00019PDNY,"Though this show is entertaining and rightfully scours fringe lunatics on topics such as communicating with the dead and alien abductions, don't expect a serioius discussion.  Penn and Teller obviously went in with their minds made up and find extremists, supporting the causes they choose to lambast, to ridicule. This is fine when it comes to issues that are obviously untrue and especially when the people they are excoriating are making a living off other people's suffering. However, when they tackle a serious issue such as second hand smoke this is a liability. The American Cancer Society has spoken out against second hand smoke which has resulted in many municipalities and even countries cracking down on indoor smoking, and this is a well regarded organization which basis its studies on facts.  They are also skating on thin ice when it comes to global warming. Yes some members of Green Peace are out of date hippies but that does not negate what is happenning. Penn and Teller conclude that though the earth is warming up, there is no proof that people are behind it. They then vaguely say that if people want to know more ""studies"" should be done. This is the exact stance of the Republicans, thus proving that except on first amendment issues, libertarians are Republicans in drag. They then attack PETA which is okay by me but saying in a blow harded voice, ""I would rather that all the monkeys in the world die than a single human"". I don't know about that. I could live just fine without cigarette smokers but I would miss the monkeys. Anyway, if you want facts try your local public television station. If you want amusing sketches (remember these guys are basically musicians) B.S. is okay. Just don't quote them as evidence if you are engaged in a serious political discussion.",1142121600,6,1800,4.82200647249191

As great as they were doing that kinda thing, I have to say they've really topped themselves with this.

Penn & Teller's BS takes your common and sometimes not so common existing factour in American culture and reveals it for its true value.  They deliver it in a way that's thorough, funny, interesting, raw, and all around entertaining.  Thinking on it, if there were any other show to ever arrive that had the same form of theme, I simply couldn't imagine it being done better than how it's done with this program.",1140998400,,701,4.4453125

1982948,2,B00019PDNY,"I enjoy a good, hard, critical look at things and this is not one of them. The format of this show - to be a shocking expos of all things that two magicians could know everything about - gets tired quickly and becomes its downfall. After seeing Penn and Teller take the air out of a goofy magnetic cure-all while completely ignoring the elephant in the room (acupuncture), you start to smell their own bullsh*t. The limited scope of this vitriolic crap-slinging wouldn't be so hard to take if it weren't for them offering their one-sided two cents on touchy complex issues like genetically modified foods, which reduces all of Greenpeace to the lower rung of well-meaning idiots. Easy targets abound and they are well picked here. Why don't you ask Penn and Teller to do a follow up on superweeds - the dangerous and costly hyrid offspring that their GM scienists said could never happen? If Penn and Teller really meant well, they'd call bullsh*t on themselves.

In the end, this amounts to a childish point-and-laugh mixed with dangerous one-sided misinformation. It started off being enjoyable but it's more marketing than meat here and I can only imagine that this is going to get worse as they try and spread this tired coat of bile over more seasons.",1136160000,23,1256,4.735159817351598

1982966,5,B00019PDNY,"Of course the review ""Skeptical about the skeptics, July 26, 2004 Reviewer: Robert Graves (Thompson Station, TN USA)"" will say that Penn & Teller's shows are slanted towards proving their side of an arguement over ""presenting the facts in an objective manner"". His review pointed out how he disagreed with the SECOND HAND SMOKE episode. But that's the whole problem with the show. No, not 'slant' that P&T take on the subjects, but the people who DISAGREE with the arguements will always FEEL as if P&T have slanted things in lieu of objectiveness.

But this show IS not an OBJECTIVE show. It's an EXPOSE. Penn & Teller are FIRM BELIEVERS of their points, and use their trademark crudeness and in your face humor to help prove it. BUT WHAT IS NOT SLANTED IS THE DATA. They may put on a ""SHOW"" to help say that SECOND HAND SMOKE IS B.S., but the numbers are there.

In Robert Graves review, he mentions:

""There is a very simple point to be made regarding second-hand smoke - we know smoking causes death and illness. The same chemicals that cause these illnesses are present in second-hand smoke. Therefore, whether or not we can prove that occasional second-hand smoke causes cancer, we do know that it contains very harmful compounds""

and further states:

""The only difference between a non-smoker and smoker, then, is the amount of this smoke they are inhaling. Just because it's not proven that a smaller amount of smoke will cause me to die DOESN'T MEAN IT'S PERFECTLY OKAY for it to be floating around in the air for me to breathe""

Oh, but Mr. Graves that's EXACTLY what it means. If there was a scientific test (which there was, again referring to the data that was on the show) and it proved that secondhand smoke is not harmful and does not cause cancer, means EXACTLY THAT IT IS OKAY for you to be around it! You went against your own point there. It's not only ""NOT PROVEN"" that smaller amounts of smoke will not cause cancer and is not harmful, but it IS PROVEN that it's harmless. It's not that there hasn't been tests that don't prove it, it's that there have been tests that DO prove it.

And Mr. Graves' review also stated that:

""For their opponent, they usually find the absolute most extreme camp they can find, a camp that probably represents 10% of the other side of the argument, and they use that as the face of the enemy---Of course we're going to disagree with these idiots, therefore agreeing with Penn and Teller.""

OF COURSE Mr. Graves will feel that 10% of the people feel the way P&T's opposition feel... because he is just not ready to see that HE HIMSELF feels the same way as the 'extreme camp of the other side of the arguement'. You see a crazy guy that's against SECONDHAND SMOKE/MEAT/FUR etc... and you REFUSE to believe that YOU YOURSELF LOOK THAT WAY WHEN YOU SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT. Mr. Graves, read your review again. I'm afraid that you have proven this point yourself. Your review on the SECONDHAND smoke DISREGARDS THE SCIENTIFIC DATA that shows secondhand smoke is harmless. Yet, you say that P&T's arguement doesn't hold water. On what basis? Oh yeah, because YOU said [paraphrasing] ""smoke contains toxins... and small amounts, though proven safe, doesn't mean it's safe"". And that's the jist and asurdity of your longer winded arguement.

And that is the beauty of this show. There will be at least ONE SUBJECT that will get under your skin. Penn and Teller themselves say in one episode that people WORKING on the show refused to work on certain shows that contained subjects that they didn't agree in. One of the producers himself said he didn't work on the SECONDHAND SMOKE show because of his father dying of lung caner. So there will be at least ONE subject that you the viewer will probably skip or turn off the TV because of how it rubs you the wrong way. But you cannot ignore the scientific evidence that is presented on the show. And because of this, the show is GRAND. Whether or not you agree with them, the show promotes ""intelligent"" discussions with your friends for days on end. Trust me when I say you'll be going on and on about an episode for weeks.

So it's OKAY for Mr. Graves to feel the way he did about the SECONDHAND SMOKE EPISODE. His feelings towards the subject skews his objective look at the show. But that's what the show will do to you. At first you're all with them when they are making fun of the ALIEN ABDUCTEES, and you're laughing along with the craziness that they argue about. Suddenly, you're infuriated with the magicians because they are telling you to your proverbial face that RECYCLING IS ACTUALLY WORSE FOR THE ENVIORNMENT THAN TOSSING AWAY THAT PAPER BAG AND PLASTIC BOTTLE. But in the end, their points are all valid, and data is NOT SKEWED as Mr. Graves might want you to believe, as simple online research and a bit of deeper digging into the subject will show you that the data supplied by their experts holds true. Remember, it takes a VERY OPEN MIND to fully understand and appreciate this program. If you're set in your ways, and don't like the boat to be rocked, you may want to steer clear.",1123545600,8,5094,4.580680570801317
1982967,5,B00019PDNY,"Showtime's documentary, Penn and Teller: Bulls***, has it all (except objectivity).  It's got comedy, idiots, swindlers, magic tricks, and plenty of hidden camera ""experiments"".  Las Vegas stars Penn Jillette and his silent partner Teller, self-proclaimed truthsmiths, attack certain parts of culture that they believe (and usully correctly) to be a hoax.  Some of their targets are obvious (talking to the dead, alien abductions, ESP), while some of the other things they go after require a little more convincing from them (second-hand smoke).

This is not an objective show, and Penn and Teller do not delude themselves or their audience into thinking that it is.  In fact, they even claim that, when lining up guests for episodes, they always tell everyone which side of the issue they will be arguing in favor of.  Despite that, they always seem to find representitives from the other side of the argument who are very willing to make their point.  However, P&T, along with the guests on their side, always find ways to blow very large holes into the opposition's arguments.

There are two kinds of BS that they go after; one in which the institution itself is attacked (most of the paranormal episodes), while the other kind is when the go after the exploitation of the institution (such as in the Sex, Sex, Sex episode; sex itself isn't BS, but they it is marketed is).  Both of these methods are interesting in their own way, and our hosts almost always seem to find humor in the people that they are going after.  However, every once in a while, a BSer comes along who does something so atrocious in their minds that Penn goes very serious and points out how they are hurting others.  The example that I can think of in this season invovles the Talking to the Dead episode; these mediums who take money from grieving people so that they can ""communicate"" with recently deceased loved ones is terrible.  Also, in the Alternative Medicine episode, I think there are a few people who are in desperate need of actual medicine, but don't get it because they buy into alternative medicine (the best example overall doesn't come until season 3 in the Signs From Heaven episode).  Also, while P&T often make fun of the people who buy into the myths that they debunk, that isn't always the case.  In the Baby episode, Penn states that parents are the ones being taken advantage of, but it isn't the parents' faults, because they only want the best for their kids.

While all of the episodes are good, I have to make special mention of the Alien Abduction, Sex, Sex, Sex, and Creationism episodes.  Those were probably my favorite ones this season.  They are all very funny, informative, and, in a sense, a bit sad.  It is very weird what some people will do to believe in something very blindly (Creationism) or do in order to sell something (Aliens/Sex).

Penn and Teller are definitely not for everyone.  This show is very edgy, and since it is on Showtime, they can get away with heavy profanity and nudity.  Also, it is very offensive, and it will drive away many people.  I would be lying if I said that I have never been offended by some of the things that they've done/said, but I really don't mind.  This is a great show.",1123200000,3,3229,4.696269982238011
1982968,3,B00019PDNY,"Reviewer Robert Graves (another Amazon customer) voiced the same concerns I have with the show.  They pick easy targets and are guilty of the same problem they accuse others of: fudging or overstating facts.  The episode on second-hand smoke is the most obvious.  The EPA findings are old and new studies show second hand smoke exposure is harmful.  Penn and Teller skew the statistics (which most over zealous skeptics do).  Of course someone who sits in a bar for 10 minutes isn't at high risk, but a waitress working there is.

Other errors include genetically-modified foods: still too early to gauge long term effects not just on people, but ecologically.  They also failed to mention the overuse of milk-producing hormones in cows.  Debunking ESP also lacked the mountains of verifiable data indicating some form of ESP does actually exist.  This has been scientifically tested worldwide and is not new-age mysticism.

Another problem is their ""experts"" are themselves practioners of what the same skeptics use to consider pseudo-science such as psychology and socialogy.  That's hypocritical.

Otherwise, this is an entertaining show with good pacing to keep viewers interested.  Extras are watchable, but some of it may be filler.  Video and audio quality are great, but is geared towards documentary tv so your 5.1 audio system is going to get little use.",1123200000,9,1364,5.140909090909091

1982980,3,B00019PDNY,"This is supposed to be a rational look at some irrational phenomena such as Alien Abductions, male enlargement herbs, alternative medicine, etc. At times, P&T are entertaining and rational in their debunking. At other times, they are as bewildering as the people they hope to debunk. They are against laws that ban smoking in restaurants because there are no scientific studies proving that second-hand smoke causes lung cancer. I thought we were banning smoking in restaurants because people such as myself were tired of trying to eat our meals in a thick cloud of incinerating marlboro cigarettes and cigars. And,  yes, I do have the right to object to your behavior if it interferes with mine. Your freedom ends when I have to smell and taste your smoke (not to mention needing to launder everything because it stinks of smoke). One show is entitled, ""Alternative medicine,"" as if all alterniative medicine was going to be skewered. Nope, only a few types of alternative medicine are examined. They don't touch types of alternative medicine that have research to back them up (acupuncture, etc.) even when Western science can't explain them (that would make Western science look bad - and they can't have that. They go after creationists and find the loopiest, least intelligent, least articulate representatives for creationism and/or intelligent design while ignoring the over 60% of scientists who believe in God (and over 70% of M.D.s who believe in God) and who believe that there is more to the universe than atheistic materialism. Nope, they can't do that as their show would fall apart if all scientists weren't portrayed as intelligent, rational skeptics and all theists weren't portrayed as wackos. I guess P&T only consider scientists to be rational if they agree with P&T??  P&T show that male enlargement techniques don't work (They don't)- but then use that show as a soapbox to preach their own philosophy of sexual hedonism - which is Bull**** because one has nothing whatsoever to do with the other and this was supposed to be a show about rational debunking, not the playboy philosophy according to P&T. A lot of naked people stroll around the set exploitatively while P&T  preach away in the foreground, hardly a scientific method to deal with philosophical questions (more Bull***). Over and over again, P&T, are rational when it suits them but skip the truly objective approach when it might lead to a stalemate or to them looking like wienies.

People on the far Left will hate this and they will be very dissapointed in Penn and Teller.  However, they need to see it.  In this day and age, where there are so many young people believing ridiculous things and becoming passionate about illogical nonsense, a show like this is important.

1982986,4,B00019PDNY,"John Edward can talk to the dead and entertain people. The X-files can explore supernatural cases, and entertain people. Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell can talk about religion on their TV shows and entertain people. Now, Penn and Teller can call all of the above ""Bullsh.t"" and entertain people - skeptical people like me (and I'm assuming) you.

The concept of the show is to take a sacred cow - environmental hysteria, ESP, creationism, alternative medicine - and devote a show to not only trying to debunk it, but have a good laugh at it in the process. Many beliefs will be shredded, many feelings will be hurt, and many people WILL be offended. But, in the process, the show will make us think about why people believe such seemingly far-out things, and why they (or you) shouldn't.

I must say, though, that anyone looking for rigorous debunkings will not quite get it here. First, each show is about thirty minutes in length, so the time constraints alone prevent any really detailed factual debunking. Secondly, Penn and Teller are entertainers and, as such, their first goal is to keep you interested. The best way to lose an audience, though, is to lecture them with lengthy factual diatribes.

So, all in all, I agree with some other reviewers that one must be skeptical also of the skeptics. In the ""Environmental Hysteria"" episode, for instance, Penn and Teller 'expose' environentalism as a farce by... showing us many clips of the looniest environmentalists they can get their hands on. But this doesn't disprove environenmentalism's claims; it only casts doubt on some of the players. Other episodes do similar things: they take a belief, show that there are some very strange people who believe in it, and conclude, from that, that it is bunk - ""Bullsh.t.""

I am not going to take but one star off for this, as one looking for a THOROUGH debunking of the highlighted ideas need not look far to find them. (How many times has creationism or ESP been refuted? Too many to count!) As un-PC as it is to say, what we get with this show is a pure, unbridled entertainment for the skeptic - a chance to kick back and laugh at loony people with loony ideas.

1982988,4,B00019PDNY,"I have mixed feelings about this series.  I really like what Penn and Teller are trying to do with this show, and I tend agree with them more than I disagree.  When someone is arguing a point that I agree with, I have a tendency to be even more critical of their arguments; so, I am very critical of any weak arguments that they may make.  Regardless, we are in dire need of more skeptics in this society, so I am glad that this show exists.

Michael Shermer stated in his book, ""Why People Believe Weird Things"", two fallacies of being a skeptic.  One is that when a skeptic disagrees with absolutely everything at face value, their arguments become less valuable.  The other is that skeptics are often so used to arguing against others, that they forget to closely analyze their own stance; thereby not accepting the skeptics of their skepticism.  This could lead to the false belief that any form of disagreement is correct, which Penn and Teller are occasionally guilty of in this series.  This is the mistake of using skepticism as a dogma rather than as a scientific method.

Episode one is a great starter to the series.  It exposes mediums as frauds who use techniques, much like psychics do, to hot and cold read people.  The second episode on alternative medicine is one of my favorites.  They informatively use science and logic to debunk reflexology, magnet therapy, and chiropractors.  The Alien abduction episode was a little sad, because a lot of people who believed in it seemed lost, or searching for something more.  It was really sad to see how they were exploited by people trying to milk dollars out of them.

The second hand smoke episode was interesting.  The episode was not so much about debunking the idea that second hand smoke is harmful.  Rather, it was about exposing the fanaticism in the anti-smoking movement, and forces non-smokers to think about the implications their movement has on civil liberties.  P&T lost me a little here, using a radio DJ as an expert, whereas in previous episodes they had used doctors, academics, as well as reputable psychologists and scientists.  Also, they start to expose their bias.  P&T are admitted Libertarians, and use data from the Cato institute, a free market biased libertarian think tank.  That's not to imply that the data gathered by Cato is wrong, but I hope anyone watching this show considers all of the sources, especially when political issues are involved.  Though they show that there is not current data to support the theory that second hand smoke is harmful, they don't really discuss that proper studies have not been done to prove it safe, either.  As a scientist who studies public health and statistics (there's my bias), I can tell you that such a study would be extremely complicated and expensive to design.  Still, from a civil liberties point of view, it is a very interesting episode to watch.

The ""Sex"" episode exposes the lengths (no pun intended) people go to in order to improve their self esteem. As with many of these episodes, it is sad to see how people get duped out of their money. The ""Feng Shui"", ""Self-Help"", ""ESP"", ""Ouija Board"", and diet episodes were much the same. The portion of the Feng Shui episode focusing on bottled water being very informative, and P&T give a link to the NRDC paper on their web site, which everyone should read.  The diet episode is very interesting, but I think they only presented half of the ""genetic"" foods issue.  It can be very beneficial to produce more abundant crops for third world countries.  Though, I wish they had addressed the issue that some corporation have been accused of engineering seeds that are only viable for one generation, making farmers dependent on the seed companies.

The final episode, on environmentalism, was the most frustrating. Their main source against the argument of global warming is author Bjorn Lomborg, who many scientists have accused of extrapolating his conclusions from cherry picked data. Any statistician who is aware of environmental issues would know that Lomborg's data does very little to prove that global warming is wrong. Many Nobel laureates have signed an anti-global warming statement, and it is a shame that none of them could be interviewed to defend global warming. The argument they make that ""there would not be any trees, were it not be for the paper industry"" was flat out ridiculous. Unfortunately, the environmental activists deserve the treatment that they got in this episode. As I said, I am even more critical of people arguing for my own side, because I don't want my side to sound ignorant. In this episode, ill informed activists who have no idea what they are talking about are the best the environmentalists could produce to represent their side. The kind of people in college who would have drum circles and protests, without ever taking a biology or chemistry class to really understand the implications of what they are fighting about. Doing research after this show, many of the pro-environment academics have said that their interviews were dramatically edited. So, once again, a person needs to remember that this is a T.V. show that is trying to prove a point, and the creators will rarely want to look incorrect.

In the introduction to his book, Michael Shermer stated that people often ask him why they should believe him. He replied, as all skeptics should, ""They shouldn't."" The controversial political analyst Noam Chomsky advises his readers to never believe anything he talks about without researching it for themselves. That advice should also be taken when watching P&T's show. Just because they are funny, charismatic, and sure of themselves does not mean that they are correct. To their credit, Penn and Teller post many of their sources and links for each episode on their web site. All in all, I think this is a series that everyone should watch. Especially if they watch it critically, and can remove themselves from the passionate arguments that Penn makes.",1105401600,38,5999,4.870206489675517

Boy, was this a TERRIFIC find!  The series itself is based on debunking myths and fads, and essentially helping to educate the masses on what is and isn't BULLS*IT in our world today.  From psychics to UFO's, to new age medicine, they use each segment to explore in depth the hows, whys, and prevention of keeping ourselves free from a society that tends to throw more BULLS*IT at us as it gets larger.  And Penn Gillette makes no bones about why he's doing what he's doing...that he thinks it's wrong for people to scam the public.  He can be given to editorial rants during the segments, but, if you watch the segments, you can understand why he got hot under the collar over them.  It puts our pop culture under a microscope and thankfully gives it a spoonful of sugar, because the medicine found in it can be quite harsh.

1983004,5,B00019PDNY,"Penn & Teller are similar to Michael Moore in that they use the same techniques to debunk populist ideas: handpick dimwits to defend the other side of the argument, cut and paste (sometimes out of context) where it will do the most damage to the opposing view, etc.

After that, there is no comparison with MM.  These guys are funny!  They are Libertarians, rather than Liberals, and are careful in picking their agenda.  Their targets of scorn are mostly fraudulent, easily refuted junkscience based notions rather than political ideology.  Unless you are a full-fledged Libertarian you will probably be offended at some point in the program when your particular sacred cow is slaughtered, but my advice is to take a deep breath, get over it, and enjoy a really excellent show.

1983005,4,B00019PDNY,"Penn and Teller's Bullshi*t is a much-needed voice of reason in the midst of the alarmist, emotionally charged know-nothings they spend their time debunking in this DVD series. What's included here is a 3-disc set that contains the entire first season (10 episodes) as well as some bonus features, most notably a bonus episode (about ghosts).

Initially, I caught Bullshi*t on Showtime and fell instantly in love with it. At last, here was a series dedicated to crushing the myths that draw in millions of non-thinking individuals. There was something almost vindicating about seeing them body-slam sensationalist after sensationalist with their rhetoric, even providing thinking America with some ammunition to battle our more, well...emotion-driven friends. I had only seen three or four installments on Showtime before buying the DVD and eagerly gobbling up all ten episodes.

Now that I've had some time with the series and have seen all the shows multiple times, something interesting has happened. The last episode I watched really got to me - an episode on second-hand smoke. For once, I thoroughly disagreed with Penn and Teller. The idiots that I normally found myself scoffing at - well, this time it was the hosts of the show. What I saw in that episode was Penn and Teller from the other side of the river. I saw them taking a very specific facet of an argument, thus pushing reams of data aside, and exploit it using arguments from the constitution applied to illogical extremes. Right away it started on a very shaky foot when they staged a scene of themselves in a restaurant with a noisy musician nearby, annoying them. ""You're annoying us - let's legislate against you,"" they began, implying that second-hand smoke was on the same level of loud music, nothing more than an annoyance.

The most important thing to note about this argument is that there *is* legislation against loud music. It's called disturbing the peace. So apparently ""annoying"" habits are regularly legislated against, including the one they were trying to portray as absurd as an analogy.

Their main thread in this argument was that since there was no direct data that linked second-hand smoke to illness, second-hand smoke is therefore okay to have around. Their sub-point is that the EPA exaggerated some data in a report they issued in the 90s, and this exaggeration has been used to fuel the legislation against smoking in public. Therefore, they seem to imply that because of the bogus data, the legislation against second-hand smoke is also bogus.

To me, neither of these arguments hold any water. There is a very simple point to be made regarding second-hand smoke - we know smoking causes death and illness. The same chemicals that cause these illnesses are present in second-hand smoke. Therefore, whether or not we can prove that occasional second-hand smoke causes cancer, we do know that it contains very harmful compounds. The only difference between a non-smoker and smoker, then, is the amount of this smoke they are inhaling. Just because it's not proven that a smaller amount of smoke will cause me to die doesn't mean it's perfectly okay for it to be floating around in the air for me to breathe. If I sprayed arsenic and carbon monoxide into someone's face, they would arrest me. If I blow it into someone's face after inhaling it from a cigarette, it's legal in most areas. This is completely illogical to me. Speaking to their second point, just because the data may have been exaggerated, it doesn't mean that it's not fundamentally true.

Anyway, this exposed some of the techniques that Penn and Teller use, and I started looking for them in other episodes, even those episodes with which I wholeheartedly agreed (in other words, all of them). I found something pretty standard in all their arguments. For their opponent, they usually find the absolute most extreme camp they can find, a camp that probably represents 10% of the other side of the argument, and they use that as the face of the enemy. For example, in their episode on eating and feeding the world, whom did they choose as the antagonist? Greenpeace and a group of hippie-freakshows who only eat raw foods. Of course we're going to disagree with these idiots, therefore agreeing with Penn and Teller. We leave the show thinking that any and all genetically-altered foods should be dumped into the 3rd World, bar none.

What they don't show you are the extremely intelligent, forward thinking scientists who recognize the *legitimate* problems with this. Most notably, while genetic engineering may have saved a billion lives it has also done something else very obvious - drastically increased the population. Therefore, deaths related to overpopulation not associated with starvation - like aids, leprosy, and other illnesses - have drastically increased, inverse to the decrease in deaths from starvation, even exceeding it in some areas. So in trying to do good, we could, in the end, be killing more people. I'm not saying I totally agree with this point of view, just that it is a legitimate facet of the argument that isn't so easily dismissed with a wave of the hand like the ignorance of the losers that Penn and Teller put on camera. So be aware as you watch, that there are almost always more viable arguments against their points that they are not showing you. By consistently choosing only the far spectrum of their opponents, they safely avoid putting an intelligent adversary - which would probably fall somewhere in between Bullsh*t's POV and the extremist they've chosen - into the equation.

This doesn't mean I won't continue to watch regularly and cheer P&T on, or show these episodes to my more gullible friends who may be environmentalists or alternative medicine subscribers. Just understand that more often than not, there is a wide gap between what Penn and Teller are advocating and whom they choose to portray on their show, and in that gap lies a full spectrum of arguments for you to explore.",1090713600,328,5999,4.944444444444445

Not only do you learn something when you watch ""Bulls---"" you have a lot of laughs too.  I laughed myself silly while watching the episode ""Environmental Hysteria.""

Their brand of magic and humor is both fully original and entertaining (refreshing in this day and age of ripoffs and unoriginal entertainment--REALITY TV, need I say more?).  As for this DVD set...its value lies in its ability to entertain.  I wouldn't go much further than that though.  There are some things everyone who watches this DVD set will either completely agree or completely disagree with--that's the nature of this type of material.  However, as it seems with so many reviews posted here, I certainly would not take what two hilarious and very talented magicians say on a 30 minute television program to be absolute truth.  If I do that, then I'm just as gullible as the folks Penn and Teller are trying to discredit.  In addition, I certainly would not call Penn and Teller scientists.  On the contrary, they are entertainers--just ask them!  They get paid a lot of money to sign contracts to do television shows which spark controversy.  That's what we like to watch these days isn't it?  As such, this DVD set should be watched for its entertainment value and not its scientific validity.  It seems by the nature of their profession they are more than qualified to debunk psychic frauds like John Edwards, however I don't know that their credentials as magicians are so credible when it comes to making valid attempts to explain things like the beginnings of mankind!  All in all the set, when it's not being offensive, is highly entertaining.  If one doesn't take this stuff too seriously, it's an entertaining watch.",1086393600,14,1590,4.862453531598513

1983023,5,B00019PDNY,"I have been surveying this presentation by long-since favorite prestidigitation performers Penn & Teller, and have found it to be humorous, elucidating, and edifying. Entering the various realms of the paranormal racket, they tear the lid off of charlatans and hoaxers with a critical eye and incisive commentary spiced with their particuar brand of humor and intelligent, sarcastic wit. I find this to be useful as a form of stratification, dividing between all of the so-called ""genuine"" gobbledigook, and actual practitioners. But like LaVey said, ""everybody is on the take"", which I believe would account for about 99% of the genre, but there are certinaly diamonds in the rough, although a sizable minority at that.
Topics that are covered is the objective study of ""Feng Shuey"", which in My opinion, is simply nonsense; the power of suggestion is practiced in a segment about bottled water - My favorite is ""Agua De Culo""; Creationism vs. Evolution {the latter simply makes more sense}; Apocalyptic mythologies; ""self-helpless"" programs; urban legends, The Ouija Board, ghosts, mediums, and much more.
Segments are introduced and concluded with sharp and concise commentary based upon subjective reasoning, scientific fact, as well as visual demonstrations illustrating the wonderful element of Doubt, through which truth is obtained. Thuroughly entertaining from beginning to end.
It is known that the sheeple desire to be fooled for some sense of closure for tragedies, and will frequently seek out various placebos to fill their empty lives with some sort of external 'meaning', which, if they cannot figure it out for themselves, is none, but to remain puppets for the clever who will prey upon the suckers of humanity.

There are 13 30 minute episodes where the two magicians take on issues such as ESP, alien abductions, bottled water and diet fads to name a few and try to debunk each of them.  The episodes, which are narrated by Penn (since Teller doesn't talk), interject Penn's wicked dialogue (which is often profane, but that's OK with me) with interviews with people who believe in the topics at issue, followed by Penn trying to humiliate those people.  I often wonder if the people are told that if they give an interview for the show they are going to be humiliated.
What I like about Penn and Teller's approach is that they don't tackle political issues, like tax breaks or war in Iraq.  They basically focus on pop culture issues.  I'm not interested in some of the topics they discussed (Feng Shui being one, for example), but their delivery of the material make it watchable.
One thing, this show isn't for kids, in particular the show that they do about sex, where fully nude men and women walk around them during their dialogs, but I can't believe kids would be that interested anyway.

It is refreshing to see Penn and Teller expose such nonsense as talking with the dead, the 'dangers' of second-hand smoke, alien abductions, and the so-called positive effect of Mozart on a baby's development. And who better to debunk these phenomena than two magicians themselves, following the tradition of the Amazing Randi and Long John Nebel. In fact, Randi makes an appearance in their episode debunking Nostradamus; this episode alone is worth the price. What particulary strikes me as hilarious is the reactions of those in my audience of DVD watchers. They cheer when P & T gore someone else's bull, but are quick to disagree, usually emotionally, when their own particular ox is gored.

1983032,1,B00019PDNY,"While the DVD set itself is fine with a couple of nice extras, the problem here is the series, which isn't very good. The problem is that the duo stacks the deck against what ever subject they are ""investigating"" so much that after a couple of minutes I was throwing up my hands going ""alright already, I get the point"".
Finding the craziest people involved in any subject they use their extreme point of view to explain whats wrong with a subject. For example, the chiropractor who insists one can and should adjust newborns is held out as the reason all chiropractors are bad. To say that this guy is dangerous would be an understatement,and clear to any rational person but it doesn't mean all those in his profession are bad. This is stacking the deck too much in their favor.
The duo also stages events to see how much people will believe. Its all staged to make the people involved look very stupid. They have a ""doctor"" in a mall helping people with the magnetism of those red horse shoe magnets you had in grammar school. Plenty of people go along, but I'm left to wonder if they really believe or just want to get on TV. (I think its just to get on TV since its so stupid I can't beleieve anyone would seriously believe it was real)
I can't see spending money on this set, its 13 episodes of the same thing over and over again. It doesn't play any better on DVD than it did on TV.

One of the highlights of the first season is the oft-mentioned Environment episode, where P&T drill past the frozen dogma of the politically correct to ask some new questions and actually uncover an intelligent middle ground where dialogue can occur--their use of the brilliant and besieged Bjorn Lomborg is thought-provoking.

Simply put: this series is hilarious and a lot of fun watching + learning!!! No really.. it's educational,1078617600,16,439,4.301204819277109
1983036,2,B00019PDNY,"I love Penn and Teller.  Their stage show is quite possibly the greatest live performance I have ever seen, and I have seen it twice.  What they have done for the world of magic is inestimable, and their atheism and scepticism regarding the paranormal is commendable.  BUT...
This DVD seems to catch them in some sort of decline, due in part to their surprising devotion to infantile Ayn Rand-ish ideas of free market ends-justify-the-means-ism.  As has been noted by other reviewers, this easily-refuted, overly-simplistic ideology has committed them to the preposterous idea that the environment is in great shape, and in order to support this blatantly false idea they have had to turn to Bjorn Lomborg, a pseudoscientist whose views go beyond self-interested wild-guessing and into the realm of blatant falsehoods and wilful distortion of information.  It should be kept in mind that, despite the positively vast anti-environmentalist lobby, Lomborg's views are so far from scientific consensus that over 1/2 of the world's living nobel laureates have signed a document against all Lomborg says -- something that has never taken place for any other cause.  And yet Penn and Teller wish to use Lomborg to support their views here?  Please -- this is as bad a case of rational minds falling into irrationalism as was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's falling for spiritualism.  I hope to see the bad boys of magic get over this pitfall and onto the right side of things scientifically, rather than engaging in this empty and harmful wishful thinking.",1078272000,36,1543,5.071146245059288
1983037,5,B00019PDNY,"Master stage magicians Penn and Teller take on psychics, astrology, the environment, and a host of other questionable topics.  Like the title of the show, Penn and Teller do not hesitate at all in demonstrating that the frauds, con men, and phony scientists are full of Bull Sh*t!  Happily, they manage to do it with a unique style and humor that left me snorting Dr. Pepper through my nostrils.  Ouch.  It was worth it!
In the process of watching these programs, you will learn exactly -how- frauds and fakers pull of many of their stunts, -why- certain pseudoscientists and pseudo historians are wrong, and even -why- people are often so eager to believe and accept things at face value.  While our prestidigitationator hosts are opinionated, they are always on the side of the common man (us) who so often plays the dupe to the frauds of our day.
These programs are entertainment and education rolled into one.  I am not the sort of person who usually buys dvds of every series I like.  This series was warrented though, and long overdue...Penn and Teller have proven themselves worthy of a place on any skeptic's shelf.  Enjoy!",1078272000,90,1131,4.764102564102564

Penn also explains why he calls it ""BS"", instead of something more inflammatory or provocative. NOT for kids, but for inquisitive adults.",1417478400,,291,5.326086956521739
