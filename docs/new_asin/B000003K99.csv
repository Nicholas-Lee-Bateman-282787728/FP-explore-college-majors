7902842,5,B000003K99,"For fans of the Warrior Race, ""Soldiers of the Empire"" is arguably the best Klingon episodes of any Trek series.  The entire story is set on a Klingon Bird of Prey.  Worf boards as Exec, to bolster the shaky leadership of the warship's commander, General Martok.  Jadzia Dax signs on as a subordinate bridge-officer, to monitor the growing unrest of the Klingon crew.  Having suffered some humiliating defeats by Dominion forces, the warriors are now further demoralized by Martok's cowardly avoidance of combat.  Resentment is rampant and to Dax's dismay, Martok and even Worf seem oblivious to the impending mutiny.  How disaster is averted, and the very Klingon manner in which Worf restores Martok's confidence and command make for a good story.  Even better are the characterizations of the Klingon crew, who are not just stereotypical berzerkers.  Borrowing heavily from the definitive novel ""The Final Reflection"", they are scripted as interesting but alien people with individual strengths and weaknesses.  Particularly compelling is the female engineer who fearlessly asserts her position as third in command.  And David Graf, best known for his comic portrayal of firearms-fanatic Officer Tackleberry (""Police Academy"") gives a delightful performance as the frustrated helmsman.  Perhaps the sweetest treat for Trekdom's klinfans is the cast's rousing battle-ballad with singable lyrics in the authentic klingo-lingo.  ""Soldiers of the Empire"" provides little of plot-importance to DS9's ongoing space-opera, but it is certainly one of the most enjoyable episodes of the series.",1003449600,8,1588,5.54356846473029
7902843,5,B000003K99,Why is paramount withholding these great episodes? This like almost all of Deep Space 9 was such a great episode. Is it revenge for our love of this series or just a plot to bleed even more money out of us. Can anyone at  Paramount answere this question?,956534400,5,254,4.291666666666667
