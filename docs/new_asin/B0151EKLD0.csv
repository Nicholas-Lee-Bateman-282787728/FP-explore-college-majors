7425341,5,B0151EKLD0,Beautifully crafted movie. Its quite a complex piece and put together so well. The main focus of this movie is the hero doing everything he possibly can to take a little mute girl to back to her family. Layered around the story is the fact that the girl is form Pakistan while the hero is from India two completely different cultures whose governments are at war with one another. Regardless of the tension between the two cultures Bajrang has promised to take the girl back home after nearly handing her off to be sold into prostitution by a charlatan who said he'd help so that Bajrang wouldn't have to cross borders.  Along the way the director shows Bajrang learning that all his conceptions about the opposing culture isn't so different from his and by staying true to his own religion he gets help to complete his mission all along the way showing that human kindness and love triumph over hate. The reporter that helps him couldn't have said it any better its easy to sell hate love not so much. The Pakistani govenment is dead set on painting him as an indian spy after being caught but police officials and people from both sides rise up and challenge government officials at the border between the two countries to help set him free letting human kindness shine to correct a wrong lest he be put in prison for life for having done the right thing. The girl is also there and in a desperate attempt to say her own good bye to her saviour finally manages to talk ands yells out to him with everyone there witnessing what love can accomplish.,1523664000,2,1549,4.5321428571428575

7425344,5,B0151EKLD0,"These are the kind of movies that remind us that if there should be any religion it should be called HUMANITY; no prophets, no gods, no holy books with rules that divide us, just simply good and kind people doing their best not to consciously harm one another. Haven't cried this much watching a movie in a long time. Superb acting, cast and directing. Absolutely a must-watch!",1518480000,,377,4.641791044776119

7425350,4,B0151EKLD0,"I'm new to Bollywood and this is only the second Salman Khan film I've seen. I'm much more of an Aamir fan but I was pleasantly  surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Very sentimental story but well told, with many funny moments and lots of heart. Salman and the little girl have wonderful chemistry and their relationship forms the heart of the movie. I think this would be a good introduction to Bollywood for those who don't know anything about mainstream Hindi films.",1509235200,,471,4.607142857142857
7425351,5,B0151EKLD0,"This was an amazing story, very well told. The young girl who plays Munni was fabulous. Extremely emotional film. Cried like a baby, especially during the last 30 minutes or so.",1502841600,,177,4.741935483870968
7425352,5,B0151EKLD0,"Salman Khan plays Pawan, a devotee of Lord Hanuman. He finds a lost little girl (Harshaali Malhotra) who is mute. It is eventually revealed that she is Pakistani, and Pawan must risk his life and freedom to travel there and return her to her home.

Khan plays his gentle character perfectly, but Malhotra--even silent-- steals the show. Both actors relate well to each other, and their camaraderie feels genuine. The plot is touching, serious, and heartwarming. Overall, it's a fantastic movie.",1501632000,,494,5.098765432098766
7425353,5,B0151EKLD0,"A story of selfless love that portrays all the awesome possibilities when we embrace being human in society, no matter what the borders, or race, or  differences. A story of a mother and a family's boundless love for a child, and all the joys and agonies that accompany it. The true beauty of the movie was the six-year old girl, played by Harshaali Malhotra. Without a word, she had a voice throughout the movie. Her expressions were eloquent and more moving than mere words. It is astounding how she communicates all without an utterance. Salman Khan was superb and so genuine. As Pawan, he believed and so did we the audience. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a journalist gives the movie the perfect balance between love and criticism. The cinematography was lush and clear, and the music so moving and beautiful that it resonated and was recalled even when the movie was done. Please watch this movie. It is a rare opportunity to watch something truly good and heart lifting.",1501459200,3,970,4.773809523809524
7425354,5,B0151EKLD0,"Engaging story that generally moves at a good pace. For a six-year old with no dialogue Harshaali Malhotra's portrayal is Oscar-stellar. My hat's off to her and to Kabir Khan who was able to direct her to produce such natural facial expressions and body language. Nawazuddin Siddiqui was likewise a show stealer even though in a highly unusual script arc, his major character doesn't even appear in the story until well after half done. But what he lacks in air-time, he more than makes up for in his relatable portrayal of a struggling journalist with heart. One cannot reflect on this movie without also acknowledging the magnificent cinematography, something that oozes promise from shot 1 and keeps going whether it was to be snow-capped peaks, lush valleys or Sindhi desert. The musical numbers (especially the extravaganza that introduces Salman's character) can get a overly long, but other than that, as a story firmly in the ""journey home"" genre, it's a classic that transcends language and culture. Whether or not you understand its colorful Hindi and Urdu with English subtitles, you can't be human if your emotions aren't in overdrive by the end.",1499126400,2,1158,5.036458333333333

Really great movie and Salman Khan not his kind of whimsical self in this one; much deeper acting on his part.

I bought it on video when it came out, and twe watched it twice that weekend, including my daughter's boyfriend and my husband, neither of whom typically watch foreign movies.

8732249,5,B0151EKLD0,"This is by far one of the best movie performances given by actor Salman Khan (as Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi alias Bajrangi Bhaijaan) This character protrayed by him suits him perfectly and thankfully he has not overacted too much thus making it a success. Harshaali Malhotra as Munni, shown as a mute girl is adorable. She is the main character of the movie who has not spoken a single word yet conveyed everything beautifully. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Chand Nawab, shown as a Pakistani reporter, has done good acting too. The movie has very good story-line and is truly heartwarming. Cinematography in this movie is very good. Cinematographer Aseem Mishra has captured some excellent shots.

Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a moving story of Pawan Kumar's quest to unite the child with her parents against all odds. The film still holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I enjoyed this movie watching with my family and I am sure you too will enjoy it.

Rating with five stars!",1530144000,,961,4.853658536585366
8732250,5,B0151EKLD0,"This movie was absolutely incredible and amazing and breathtaking! It made me laugh, cry, and scream and no words will do this beautiful performance justice. I think this was one of Salman Khan's best roles and he should make more movies like this. Harshaali Malhotra's debut performance on the big screen will be one to remember as her acting did the role justice. All around amazing film and one to recommend to everyone. The beauty and humanity of it is something everyone should experience for themselves.",1529625600,,509,4.930232558139535
8732251,5,B0151EKLD0,"An incredibly heartwarming movie that gives you all the feels. One second you are shedding tears and the next laughing. The socio-political commentary on relations between India and Pakistan as well as the caste system within India is important to note too. We are all human with the ability to experience love and loss, regardless of culture or religion.",1528675200,,355,5.033898305084746
