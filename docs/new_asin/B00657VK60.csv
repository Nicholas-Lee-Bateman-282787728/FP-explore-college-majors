8493316,1,B00657VK60,"It's a shame that Sebastian's family can not accept the truth about their son and brother. This happens a lot with family members of murderers, and someday I hope a good article or book will be written about the failure of family members to accept the truth about their criminal family member. Because they can't accept the truth about Sebastian, this superfluous, misleading and unhelpful piece of filmmaking was inflicted upon the public.

Because a controversial undercover sting technique (supposedly banned in the US but legal in Canada) was used to help bolster the case against the suspects, Sebastian, his attorneys and his family have decided (or are stipulating, in the case of Sebastian) that he is innocent. The most important thing to know is this: Sebastian's guilt is obvious even without the fruits of the controversial technique. There is a mountain of evidence proving the guilt of Mr. Burns and his accomplice, even without the Mr. Big sting video. The Mr. Big sting video merely confirms, in a more deeper way, the guilt and the mindset of these two men--especially Mr. Burns. Mr. Burn's body language alone on the video disproves any claim of being scared that is offered by the defense.

There is a lot of excellent coverage--including a good book sold on Amazon--about this case to be found. I suggest you stick to that. This film is a very sad and misguided attempt on the part of Sebastian's sister to help free her very dangerous brother from the prison he needs to stay in for a whole lot longer.",1461628800,2,1523,4.809160305343512
8493317,1,B00657VK60,"A very bias movie, clearly motivated to manipulate the viewer and attempt to build support for her brother.  I was very much hoping for Tiffany Burns to actually show all the evidence, however she chose to show essentially nothing exculpatory.  I would strongly suggest you not waste your money on this film.",1452297600,2,308,4.903846153846154
8493318,5,B00657VK60,"This documentary sheds light on a deeply troubling practice of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  When police officers, who are supposed to be the guardians of public safety and ethics, resort to ethically questionable tactics, they lose all legitimacy and credibility.  Especially when those tactics are used to take advantage of the young, the mentally disabled, or the desperately impoverished.  In July of 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled to limit the admissibility of evidence obtained in Mr. Big stings.  Let us hope Mr. Big's days are numbered.  Thanks to filmmaker Tiffany Burns for this excellent piece of documentary journalism.",1422748800,4,646,5.356435643564357
8493319,5,B00657VK60,This movie is the culmination of this fascinating case.  It documents a whole other side of the gruesome murders of the Rafay family.  Very interesting concepts blend with the charisma of Sebastian Burns to create a winning documentary that is a must see for all passionate learners of life!,1397433600,4,291,4.918367346938775
