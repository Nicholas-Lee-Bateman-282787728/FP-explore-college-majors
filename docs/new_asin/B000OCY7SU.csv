8184332,5,B000OCY7SU,"i chose this 5 star rating, because i like this one to, and it is very interesting, how these people study these tornados in the midwest in different areas that are very flat with no mountains at all.  i would not want to live in the midwest since they have a lot of problems with tornados.  i recommend this movie to everyone that likes tornados.",1392249600,2,347,4.323076923076923
