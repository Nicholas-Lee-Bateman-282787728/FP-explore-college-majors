1419131,5,B00005AX8B,"When I first saw this film, my heart sank because I have never seen something so touching and realistic.  Mercy Streets shows to everyone that anything is forgivable if they mean it.  The mean, sick twisted brother looked like he would always stay in the darkness of sin forever because he was leading such a horrible life.  Through the forgiveness of his brother and more importantly God, he was able to be rescued and to live a life of happiness even through his past events.  I rate Mercy Streets 5 stars and I hope everyone does too.",986083200,6,537,4.505154639175258

1419164,1,B00005AX8B,This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched. Acting and plot were just horrible.  Hardly a Christian theme.,1370217600,,113,4.65
1419165,4,B00005AX8B,"Mercy Streets shows that through the power of God broken relationships from the past can be mended, people can get second chances, and serves as a reminder that we always have a choice.  Twin brothers are each at a crossroad in their lives.  Circumstances intervene, offering the opportunity for them to put their faith in God.  It was a good story to watch with characters I actually cared about.  It was a great way to spend my Easter morning.",1336262400,,445,4.594936708860759
1419166,3,B00005AX8B,"Even though there are some notable actors in this, like Eric Roberts, this movie lacks a strong story line. I would rather has spent the money on another movie. Disappointing and somewhat lame.",1331424000,,193,4.878787878787879
1419167,5,B00005AX8B,I enjoyed the movie and it came in the mail quickly. It was a good and entertaining story about a man turning his life around.,1318896000,,126,4.08
1419168,4,B00005AX8B,"It's difficult to know where to go with reviewing this movie because it seems a bit like a ""cross over"" type movie made to take in a wider audience.  Overall I thought it was very good and I liked it - I especially like the David White / Kevin Downes creative team.

The plot was a stretch and difficult to follow in places, but David White's acting pulled it off well.

The opening scene was intriguing and hooked me immediately.  However when the movie caught up with it's opening scene chronologically, instead of it being an ""Oh!-I-Get-It!"" moment - it seemed anti-climactic when you hear the rest of the dialog at that point.

The ""message"" is not as clear as in movies like ""The Moment After"" or ""Six - The Mark Unleashed"" (both - MUST SEE movies!) but it is there.

This movie has Spanish Subtitles but I was looking for English Subtitles because sometimes I have difficulty in discriminating dialog.

If you purchase this DVD (and I recommend it for it's performances and it's message) be sure to watch the Featurette about how it was made because you learn a lot about David White and Kevin Downes and the planning and the problems that go into producing a movie like this and also the blessing for all involved in the endeavor.",1301184000,,1237,4.545045045045045
1419169,3,B00005AX8B,"In the beginning, i didn't know what was going on. Then i saw what happened later on. A bit confusing at first. Then you can see what happens later. Usually when i see David White, i look for more of a Christ witness. this was different. i expected more of the bible and stirring toward Jesus. this was sibling rivalry more that about Jesus. even though the preacher  did things for his brother, I just wish he would have trusted God more than do what he did. Vengence is mine, i will repay saith the Lord. i expected more from David White though. Hes halarious and me and my son laugh at him alot. But, i just wanted more Jesus. Good if you like to figure stuff out.",1298764800,,667,4.2109375
1419179,2,B00005AX8B,"David White plays a street character(s), which threw me off during the whole movie.  I couldn't get into this, preferring a more Christian theme. The language wasn't raw, guess that makes it a family film. I cannot show mercy for this street movie -- too far of a stretch from anything that could occur in reality. Maybe I didn't understand the message; I'll try watching it again, just for the sake of David White.  (smile)",1295827200,,424,4.64
1419180,5,B00005AX8B,"When i first saw this film, i was so blown away.

It was the first smart, clever, great acting, christian film i'd seen to date.

It has a really interesting plot with twin brothers separated  when they were young,
and the two different paths they take.

to sum up the message, no matter what side of the street you grow up on, we all need God's mercy.

I loved this film.  I'm a David A.R.White fan, and he is as always, great, playing two roles,
Eric Roberts plays a great bad guy, with an amazing supportive cast.

Great job - i highly recommend this movie, especially to your non christian friends.",1283731200,,602,4.36936936936937
1419181,3,B00005AX8B,This movie was okay - not good enough to recommend to anyone.  The plot and the acting were somewhat superficial.,1265846400,,113,4.65
1419182,3,B00005AX8B,I enjoyed the movie enough to watch it again and to share with some friends.,1256860800,2,76,4.133333333333334
1419183,3,B00005AX8B,"Well, I'm skeptical, I admit, viewing ""Christian"" movies since many have been made that weren't realistic nor well-constructed.  This one is respectable:  a decent plot, good acting ( Eric Roberts and especially Stacy Keach ), solid soundtrack.
I can't give it a higher rating since the story/pace felt sluggish overall.  There was something about the lead actor that seemed to drag at times, and the depth of emotion ( i.e. Samantha's character after she was verbally thrashed by the ""fake"" Jeremiah ) needed some help.
Overall, I recommend the movie for being a good tale about forgiveness and love.",1247356800,,601,5.05050505050505
1419184,5,B00005AX8B,"If you are a Christian and like action movies, this is a movie for you.  There are car chaces, foot chases, criminal violence and most everything one would expect in a typical Hollywood action movie - except that there is no bad language.  This isn't a movie for preteen kids.  I would say that this is the best Christian oriented action movie so far.

When most Christians in Christian movies are obnoxiously religious, it is refreshing to see a completely different portrayal of believers.  Indeed, there are four Christians portrayed in this movies, and each is at a different level of belief.  The seminary student about to be ordained loves the Lord, but he is not completely sure in his belief and lets his emotions get in the way at times.  The police officer is a lay person who is sure of his belief, and willing to just 'be there' for others who need him.  The student's girlfriend seems to be mostly a nominal Christian.  And the pastor played by Stacy Keach is a mature Christian, wise in his approach to counseling.

I probably should also mention that this movie is well within the standards of Hollywood movie making.  It probably has the most stunts of any Christian theme movie.  In short, it is a very exciting movie that could have been just another 'good brother, bad brother' movie, but it rises well above the ordinary with new and refreshing plot twists.

[To 'No Truth Here,' I wonder if you missed the part of the movie where Stacy Keach was counseling  Jeremiah.  If that isn't a solid Christian message, what is?  It may not be 'the Baptist' or some other Fundamentalist message, but it certainly is well established Biblical truth.]",1211328000,4,1660,4.672413793103448
1419185,4,B00005AX8B,"I love this movie. It's not a Christian film just because it has religion in it. What it is is entertaining. The drama, the love between estranged twin brothers that changes lives for the better. The compassion and goodness shown in the brother who was raised by criminals and who overcame his upbringing to do the right thing at his own sacrifices. The revealing of humanity in the hearts of the not so fortunate. The struggle of a young man who wants nothing more than to make amends for a decision made as a boy that cost him his brother. Finding out his brother lives gave him a second chance, a second hope. Switching places, one a priest in training, one a criminal by vocation, brought out the best in both. They found each other and then they found themselves. Laugh, cry, and be entertained by this unusual and remarkable film.",1192665600,,836,4.543046357615894
1419186,2,B00005AX8B,"We heard this was a Christian movie, and were sorely disappointed after viewing it. First, the Gospel was never clearly presented. The church represented was the Episcopal Church, which is a mainline denomination where few claim to be ""born-again."" Secondly, the plot is confusing and silly, with the main character playing two roles (identical twin brothers) who essential change places. However, the good one is supposed to be a pastor, and yet he is willing to commit a crime for his criminal brother, and he also cannot seem to understand salvation, as he ends up in another church being preached at by Stacy Keach (actor playing a priest). The story is a non-sensical mess. Save your money.",1159747200,4,695,4.948717948717949
1419187,5,B00005AX8B,Seen this one in the theaters when it came out.  Was very impressed by the actor David White and really enjoyed this film.  One of the best Christian films so far.,1152403200,,163,4.225806451612903
1419188,5,B00005AX8B,"My favorite thing about this little surprise of a movie

was the music!  There are several songs in there from

Keaton Simons.  And remember, we're talking almost five years ago.  He's just having his album released this year...so it's a little gem, showing the filmmakers being way ahead of their time.

Now you can google him and he's all over the place. Back then he was just a teenager who wrote songs, which somehow found their way into this really entertaining movie.",1103932800,2,473,4.7073170731707314
1419209,4,B00005AX8B,"Pretty good show. Yes, it sounds cliche`... the whole long lost twin coming back and assuming your life.  But I actually found this story fresh.  There are few films that address issues of faith and guilt and accepting forgiveness without being vaguely warm-fuzzy-feel-good or over-the-top-evangelical-preachy.
I liked that the main character was both a minister (or about to be) and had serious spiritual and relationship struggles.  And that the other main character was a rough-edged criminal with just as valid a faith.
The other characters fleshed the story out.  Noone served the ""typical"" side-kick role.  There was the friend, the girlfriend, and the priests who served as mentors.  But they each had their own fresh personality, not the standard cookie-cuts.  Even the criminal mastermind fellow was not a stereotype.
There was violence and the ending was weaker than I had hope for.  But this is the only movie I have ever paused to get a piece of paper and write down a quote.  The story will live in my head for a long time as a parable of accepting God's forgiveness and pressing myself to forgive others.",1085788800,6,1118,4.935828877005347
1419210,4,B00005AX8B,"This tale of two brothers mixes drama, comedy, and spirituality into a sweet story with a touch of suspense.  Twin brothers take radically different paths--one to the priesthood, the other to prison.  The priest is wracked with guilt over a childhood tragedy, while the convict is wracked with bitterness and some jealousy.  The focus is more on the brothers' psychological and social inner battles, than on the actual action and drama that surrounds them, giving the movie a light-hearted feel.
Bottom-line:  This is a feel-good movie, safe and enjoyable for the whole family, and an excellent religious conversation-starter.",1061337600,2,626,5.357142857142857
1419211,4,B00005AX8B,"While perusing the shelves at the video rental store, not in a mood to see the same films I've seen a dozen times before, I came across this diamond in the rough. Not knowing what exactly to expect, I took a chance and rented it. I must say that I was pleasently surprised. Although a Christian movie, it didn't feel like I was listening to a sermon/homily or even sitting in Sunday school. It is inviting, engaging, and thoughtful. If you ever crave an original film with a familiar storyline (criminals vs. law-abiding citizens - twins switch identities) but long for a bit of variety, definitly invest. I've since bought the movie myself.",1058572800,13,641,4.68141592920354
1419212,4,B00005AX8B,"This is the best ""Christian movie"" I have ever seen.  Most of the movies in this genre are cheap and unimaginative.  I am a fan of movies like Reservoir Dogs and Snatch, and would have never thought a movie like this could have been made.  This film has the feel of such films, yet has something to say about, not only life, but the after-life.  The casting was very well done.  I especially enjoyed the cameo by Stacy Keach.  As a Christian independent filmmaker, I was elated to realize that a movie can be made especially gritty, yet have this kind of message behind it.",1014508800,14,573,4.40952380952381
1419213,4,B00005AX8B,"Es increible como el mercado cristiano se ha expandido ltimamente, y muestra de ello son las pelculas que se han estado promoviendo tambin a nivel secular como es el caso de ""Left Behind"", y por supuesto ""Mercy streets"".
Esta pelcula es de reconocerse por la calidad en cuanto a la filmacin y estilo de fotografa que manejan, pero en mi opinin estn un poco descuidadas las actuaciones y no precisamente porque acten mal, sino ms bien porque no estn bien definidos los personajes. La historia transcurre un poco lenta y parece en ocasiones ms un captulo de alguna serie que un largometraje.
El mensaje del Evangelio no es tan directo como pensaba, pero hay que tomar en cuenta que es una palcula, no una predicacin.",1003363200,,714,4.72
1419214,5,B00005AX8B,"This film blows The Omega Code out of the water.  When watching Mercy Streets, for the first time ever with a Christian movie, I forgot I was watching a Christian movie.  I judge movies harshly -- I am unforgiving of flaws, usually.  This movie is virtually flawless.  I had very few criticisms of it.
I'm still surprised that a Christian movie turned out to be so well-made!  With The Omega Code, it was more like I was donating my time and money by watching it, though I didn't enjoy it.  With Mercy Streets, I want to see it again!",998352000,18,534,4.343434343434343
1419215,3,B00005AX8B,"For a ""Christian"" film this isn't too bad. But the acting is stiff in places and some of the stunts are lame (really fake looking punches). Some of the characters seem to me like stereotypes, not real people. And the plot is too convoluted. But the most important thing about the movie---the message of forgiveness---comes across loud and clear. I think the best performance in this film was perhaps the briefest one, by Stacy Keach.",996105600,4,433,4.786666666666667
1419216,4,B00005AX8B,"this movie is worth the cash.  i saw it a) at the test screening b) 3 times in the theaters with different groups of friends c) and bought it on dvd.  why?  hmmmm....because, well...it's GOOD.
the cinematography is excellent, the direction is phenomenal (seriously!), the acting is believable, the plot is unique (trust me!) and the soundtrack is perfect.
The ONLY (and I mean only) reservation I have about giving this film 5 stars is the unavoidable cornyness that finds its way into all movies about twins...especially if the same actor plays the role of both (as in Mercy Streets).  BUT David White pulls it off quite well...considering this 'fact'.

My husband and I love watching Christian /family style movies.  I would never watch this again and especially with children.  David Wright plays a man who is about to be ordained as a priest in the Episcopal church. He also plays his twin brother who is released from prison and has a hatred for his brother and a big bad attitude.  The Christian message is there onnly when Stacy Keach spoke to him in a church he had wandered into.  David""s ""good"" character had a few bad flaws himself for someone who was supposed to be ordained in the very near future.  His relationship with his girlfriend was weird and the type of girl she was was surprising.  She was so self centered. The ending was so disappointing.  Actually the entire movie was.  I haven't given up on David A.R.Wright yet, but I hope this is the only movie he makes like this.
