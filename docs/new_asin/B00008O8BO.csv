On YouTube you can type in ""Telemann Quatuor Parisien Giardino Armonico"" and get one of the tracks.  If you are like me, you'll love the music and performances (5 star material) and be totally turned off by the MTV-inspired visuals (hand-held video recording of players miming to a pre-recorded soundtrack, in places that could not be recorded or even performed at in the world of reality).

I believe if you are a young person, you might seriously enjoy this DVD.  If you're a little older, I think you'd rather listen to audio only.",1407628800,4,698,4.688524590163935
7986029,5,B00008O8BO,"This is not just another concert of French baroque music. The performances begin in a dreamy night scene in a torch lit grotto and continue in a series of indoor/outdoor period settings whose aim is to persuade us this music needs to be experienced in an context of baroque rooms, statues and landscape fountains. In a standard concert hall or some alien modern setting we are deprived of these things and our experience is thin. The musicians wear period costumes and our experience is an inseparable blend of the visual context and what we hear. The quality of ""hauteur"" emerges from the music quite palpably, a rare achievement and a measure of the dvd's success. It takes us beyond what a CD can aspire to.

Like everyone else, I've heard all my life how the movements of baroque suites are based on court dances, but this has always been on the abstract level for me and a matter of intellection. But it becomes palpable and woven into the texture of 18C living when we are shown these salon rooms, garden landscapes and illuminated fountains. Our response is to slip into a dreamlike trance, undergoing a transformation at very deep levels. A highlight is the inclusion of a dance programme, with government sponsored, heritage dance specialists presenting four dances from the 18C, reminding us what the chamber music we hear throughout the programme is based on.

Aristocrats of standing had to be well trained in three areas: dancing, dueling and horsemanship. And it was an oft repeated claim (apparently awarded sincerely) that Louis XIV was the finest dancer in Europe. Here we have a glimpse of how he might've danced, invoking a self-sufficient, haughty elegance light years away from the communal, ballroom dances in cinema treatments of Anna Karenina or War and Peace. Instead, we witness discipline and breeding. Without this DVD, I'd know nothing about it.

This project has brought together an innovative, enlightening and deeply satisfying plunge into the 18C milieu. After several viewings I was reminded of Talleyrand's remark, ""Only a person who has grown up before 1789 has any idea of the sweetness of life.""

Care must be taken that this region 2 production is played on a compatible, multi-region DVD player with suitable TV screen capability.  Please see the Amazon guidelines on the main product page.",1339545600,,2330,4.964102564102564
