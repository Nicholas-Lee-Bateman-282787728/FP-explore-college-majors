8241935,2,B0010ENOPI,"This was supposed to come with a cd, a 3 disc set and a hat but it only included the DVDs,  no cd or hat.",1357862400,,105,3.2
8241936,5,B0010ENOPI,"First Off I Would Like To Clear Up Some Of The Info About This Product Is Wrong On Amazon And On Many Other Websites, This Is The Legit Information.

This Is Not A ""Holiday Bundle"" Its Actual Name Is ""The Dane Cook Collection"" The Only Reason Why Many Refer To It As ""The Holiday Bundle"" Is Because This Product Was Released For A Short Amount Of Time In The Holiday Season Of 2007 And It Comes With A Winter SUperFInger Hat (Knit Hat).

This Bundle Does Not Have 3 DVDs And 1 CD, Its Actually 5 DVDS And 2 CDS, I Will Explain.

This Come's Packaged With,

Vicious Circle - Dane's First HBO Comedy Special, This Is 2 DVDs, The First DVD Contains The Version That Was Shown On HBO, The 2nd DVD Contains The DANEgerous Version, Its Uncut And About 40 Mins Longer Then The Version Shown On HBO With Great Jokes!

Tourgasm - Dane's Tour With 3 Other Comedians, First Aired On HBO, This Is 3 DVDs, 2 DVDs Of The Show, The 3rd DVD With Bonus Features.

Vicious Circle (On Audio CD) - This Is The DANEgerous Version On 2 Discs, It Just Contains Audio Of The Show For Your iPod, Zune, MP3 Player, Ect. It is also the only place where Vicious Circle Was Ever Released On Audio CD And Ever Will (You Can Still Purchase It On Amazon MP3 And iTunes But This Is The Only Place To Get It On A Physical CD).

And A SUperFInger Knit Hat.

I Got The Hat In My Package Since I Purchased Mine New Through A Seller On Amazon, Most Likely If You Buy It Used The Hat Will Not Be Included Like Others Reviewed When They Bought This Product, If You Look At The Seller Closely You Will Be Able To Tell If Its The Truth Or Not, Obviously Some People Don't Know How To Read Info About A Product Then Give The Product A Negative Review Rather Then The Seller, There Is No Reason Why People Should Give This Product A Lower Rating Because Of There Mistake Of Not Looking Closely.

This Is A Great Kit, Def. Worth For A Huge Dane Cook Fan Like Myself. I Def. Recommend!",1286928000,12,1939,4.176943699731903
8241937,3,B0010ENOPI,"The DVD set itself was in good condition but it did not come with the SuFi Knit Cap and I really wanted it for someone. If this was being sold without the hat, then the seller should have noted that in the listing! I would have bought it from someone else.",1238284800,,256,4.03921568627451
