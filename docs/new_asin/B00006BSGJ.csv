7966875,3,B00006BSGJ,"A interesting look at a life that is nothing short of extrodinary.  This documentary takes an earnest look at the life story of John Nash from a third person perspective.  I enjoyed the recreations, but was dissappointed that it did not have an actual interview with John Nash.  The interviews that it does feature offer an interesting perspective of the context of John Nashs work and life.  It's worth a look.",1034294400,6,411,4.746478873239437
