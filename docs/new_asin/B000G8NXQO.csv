2602295,5,B000G8NXQO,"This is great fun here. I won't get into the story much but, suffice to say- if you're a fan of Classic cheesy b-action films, You'll live this. It runs at a brisk pace (About 83 Minutes) features some wackiness (Rollerblading guy at the beginning jumping off a bridge and later Standing like a statue in the police station is hilarious aswell as a guy getting a Cigarette shoved into his ear), Some stilted-performances, A Fat guy with a Rad 'stache who pisses off James Remar, Good action scenes for a small budgeted film, etc.... This is great stuff. James Remar really should've had more roles where he was the star. He had great Potential as a leading man in my eyes, i've thought that ever since i saw the Warriors. Anyway, give this a try. You shouldn't be disappointed if you're a fan of great low budget B-action films. I know i wasn't. Great to watch with friends or a few beers.",1355788800,,889,4.460122699386503
2602296,5,B000G8NXQO,"This is a real action movie from the start till the end. You have to watch this in other to see how two guys destroy a gang of drug lords. I mean the gang took a whole town/village killed  any body that stick their nose into their business. Josh & his friend took the fight to them. All the bad guys were killed one after another, until the last one. This is a good movie to check out.",1277942400,,385,3.9358974358974357
2602297,5,B000G8NXQO,"Just a shame that I didn't look more closely at the details. How is it that when you search on Amazon for DVD's, you can have hits returned for VHS tapes?

Seller was very good about this and offered me a refund. Excellent service. A valuable lesson learned about searching on Amazon.",1250726400,,284,4.461538461538462
2602298,1,B000G8NXQO,"saw it for the first time the other night on ifc. this is a really bad movie. wooden acting. fuzzy plot. should have been a lot better photographed given the location, etc. the film's only redeeming quality is that the one bad guy looks like hal from malcolm in the middle. didn't realize nick cassavettes was in the film. forgettable.",1249948800,,335,4.6
2602299,5,B000G8NXQO,Great 80's action flick. Think of Patrick Swayze in this role and you get the idea. Remar was probably third or fourth choice but he was good in the lead. This is a great grade B movie all the way. Just love the feel and look of the movie. Love it!!!!!!!,1246752000,3,254,4.0
2602300,4,B000G8NXQO,"I saw this back when it first came out and recently bought it after finding out it was on dvd.  It has that typical 80's vibe to it, but it is a good movie.  James Remar is actually a good guy in this one!  Check it out.",1173744000,2,220,3.6382978723404253
2602301,5,B000G8NXQO,"Where to begin?  James Remar as a good guy?  From the moment he picked up his barbell and did one press before throwing it down in conclusion, I knew this was a different kind of action film.  It doesn't have the rhythm of most shoot em ups.  Remar's character, while definitely a hero, endures a lot of physical abuse before acheiving a victory.  And you will never guess who the main heavy is.  It's almost as if we are discovering the secrets of this crime ring along with Remar.  I am really glad this is finally coming out on DVD.  Aren't you?",1152230400,2,548,4.303921568627451
8129406,4,B000G8NXQO,"Joe Dylanne is a plain clothes New York cop. When he receives a phone call from an old flame about her family who's gone missing in the woods, he immediately setting out to help, traveling to the northwest woods only to discover that her family has been murdered after accidentally crossing paths with drug dealers and their operation. When Dylanne discovers that her younger brother survived, together with her brother's survivalist skills, they set out to seek revenge on these cold blooded killers in a hunting game of survival.

You know, this was so much better than I was expecting. It's one of those films I came across countless times at the video store as a kid but never gave it a second thought. Digging through my tape collection recently I realized that I had gotten this about a year ago and it's been sitting there all this time. I'm sure it was in one of my obscure 80's action phases and probably also because it was an RCA VHS release, which means it came in one of those sweet side-loader slip cases, which I collect from time to time. So I threw this one recently when I was in an action mood and let me tell you, this is definitely one you'll want to track down.

It's not great by any stretch of the imagination, and doesn't reinvent the genre, but if you're looking for something very 80's, made competently well, and delivers just the right amount of thrills to keep you invested for the long haul, Quiet Cool will deliver the goods. This one offered up a number of surprises for me, the first being that it starred 80's action staple James Remar as the main good guy, which is something you just didn't see very often in his entire career. Sure he's played the good guy a few times, but I had never seen a film where he was the lead, and not playing the villain. So that was a somewhat refreshing surprise. But then I was also surprised to see another baddie regular (and sometime film director), Nick Cassavetes, again playing his usual douche bag villain, barely uttering a word. Mainly just looking mean and badass in his big shoulder padded jacket and mullet. He made this the same year he played another douche baddie in the cult classic favorite The Wraith.

One of the other things that surprised me about this is that I was not expecting this to be a ""hunted in the woods"" type of film, especially since the film opens in New York, which is a pretty awesome section of the film by the way. But once the film moves to the northwest forest setting, it's where the rest of the film stays and the hunt begins, where it ultimately becomes a predecessor to films like Survival of the Game and The Hunted.

Written and directed by Clay Boris, it's a competently crafted film that carries much more of a professional's touch, looking like a film that would certainly play at your local cinema in the 80's, which combined with how entertaining it is, I'm really surprised that it didn't. Boris has a pretty long career, dating all the way back to the late 70's and still working today, and tackling pretty much ever genre, but with most of his work relegated to TV. Nothing in his filmography immediately stands out as anything I've ever seen or heard of, but at least we have this little gem.

Really, this is a far more entertaining DTV 80's flick than you and I expected it to be, and if you're into these kind of films, I strongly suggest seeking this one out. The long Out Of Print DVD is ridiculously expensive, and honestly, it's not that good to warrant the shelling out of almost $50 for it. I also highly doubt it even comes in widescreen on that OOP DVD. My suggestion is either VHS or Laserdisc. The VHS, oddly enough, is not very common so it might take some good old fashioned hunting on your part to find it, but you'll find it cheap when you do. Same goes for the Laserdisc, which I see more of than the VHS. And trust me when I tell you you're not missing out on anything by watching this the old school way. In fact, I think it adds that little extra spice to the experience.

Quiet Cool is an old school and highly entertaining action/thriller that proves James Remar is just as good playing the good guy as he is being a regular villain. If you're also wondering what Quiet Cool even means, fear not, it's explained in the film.",1474848000,,4272,4.4356687898089175

8129413,4,B000G8NXQO,"Unremarkable grade B action flick, but the only movie ever shot at Beulah Park Conference Center, a former religious campground between Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley. For local history buff completists, it's worth spending a couple of bucks.

This summer camp of the Church of the Nazarene was established in 1938 on 24 acres above Carbonera Creek, between Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley, and a ""tabernacle"" was erected in 1941. It was sold to a group of local doctors as investors in the early 70's. The survivors of the original group still hold title, though very little has been done to the property and the back cabins that were built on a steep and narrow ridgetop are melting and sliding into a surreal, Daliesque oblivion. Beulah Park was the site of the largest building in Santa Cruz County, a huge quonset hut-style structure that was destroyed in the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake.",1364342400,3,888,4.842105263157895
