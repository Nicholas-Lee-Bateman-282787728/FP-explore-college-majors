5062882,5,B0077T5SOA,"My God, it's about time they finally released S.W.A.T. The Final Season on DVD. It had been so long since the first release but thanks so much to Shout Factory for giving us all this great surprise! I enjoyed this series when it was on TV back in the 70's so much! It's really so nice to once again see these episodes that I only saw once and never again until now! The opening episode ""Deadly Tide"" with 2 great actors who, unfortunately, we lost early in life. One being Christopher George who past away from a heart attack in the 80's and the other being movie great Sal Mineo who met a tragic death in the same year of this episode, in 1976! Leslie Ann Warren looked great in her swimming suit. ""Kill SWAT"", ""The Running Man"", ""Vigilante"" and ""Ordeal"" are all great episodes plus some other ones I had never seen before. Thank You so much once again Shout Factory for giving us this series on DVD. And what could be better than having SWAT on dvd? Well, having The Rookies- Season 2 which will also be released this summer on August 7, 2012 on DVD by Shout Factory! It's taken some years but we're finally going to see and have these series on dvd.",1338854400,,1152,4.313364055299539
5062883,5,B0077T5SOA,A great DVD set. Each episode is excellent TV at it's very best. It's too bad they can't make television shows THIS GOOD today. SWAT is TV at it's best.,1338508800,,152,4.1
5062884,5,B0077T5SOA,"I grew up watching SWAT on TV, plus I was and still am a Robert Urich fan. When I bought the first season back in 03, I was jubilant. I watched every episode in less than 3 days (might've been sooner, but I worked 10 hour days back then). For the longest I've been waiting for the final season to be released, much like Vega$, where I had to get recorded copied DVD from a private seller. While watching on Hulu is fine, I needed to have the collection to my library. This show was great in every aspect; total guy show. Mostly action, a little comedy, and brotherhood. Can't wait til its released.",1335225600,2,598,4.254385964912281
5062885,5,B0077T5SOA,"Those of us who's memories have dimmed will find some changes to the show from season one.  A mix of continuity and non-continuity.

In Season Two, almost all non-police action has been removed.  No more of the guys hanging around Crazy Mary's having a beer after work.  Almost all references to girlfriends, wives and children have been removed.  Retconned Hondo (I call him Horndog Hondo) even chastely lusts after some of the female guest characters (does Betty know about this?  Hondo, how could you do this to your sons!)  Another change is that Hondo is now front and center of every single episode, with the other guys on the squad often relegated to background characters.  The show also reused sequences from two season 1 eps in season 2.

On the other hand, Chief Roman is still the chief even though he's mostly spoken of and not seen.  And the Ritchie crime family still serves as The Sopranos of SWAT-land, even if none of the characters from ""Hit Men"" in season one are reprised.  And good old Deke seems to have stayed married, although Clio is not seen in season two.

Several actors appear again playing completely different characters:  Sal Mineo, Christopher George, Robert Webber, Robert Loggia and Loni Anderson among them.  New guest stars in season two include Ann Francis, Elinor Donohue, Frank Gorshin, Diedre Hall, Lesley Ann Warren and Susan Dey.

The first season rotated two directors all season, while the second season added different directors each week, which gives the show a slightly different feel.

The stories were largely tightened up and the police action is more intense and better filmed.  No more entertaining yet ridiculous plots like ""Death Score"" or ""The Steel-Plated Security Blanket.""  This was a more serious, police-action oriented season.

""Kill S.W.A.T."" and ""Ordeal"" are outstanding episodes, while the spectacularly violent ""Deady Weapons"" is a good example of why this show got cancelled.

Loving this set.  Thanks to Shout Factory for finally making it available.  I actually preferred the first season with its greater continuity and some emphasis on the private lives of the officers, but there are some great episodes here and it is awesome to finally have them on DVD.",1333584000,29,2228,5.013623978201635
5062886,5,B0077T5SOA,"I am so glad that the final series is finally being released. I have also watched season 2 on Amazon instant video, but Peggy is right it's not like having the DVD on hand to watch anywhere. I to like Mark and T.J. in the show I wish it hadn't been cancelled, but we can enjoy it on DVD. Thanks Shout Factory!!!!",1329523200,16,312,4.048387096774194
5062887,5,B0077T5SOA,"My friends and I have campaigned to have the final season of S.W.A.T. released on DVD for so long now (nine years) that all I can say is thank you Shout! Factory for listening to the fans. I actually have been watching this second season on amazon on demand for years now and I never get tired of watching them. I even bought a Roku so I could watch them on my TV instead of my computer.  However nothing compares to having the episodes on DVD. Also a lot of my friends aren't able to get this service so they will finally get to see what I have been talking about all these years.

I really enjoyed the first season of S.W.A.T. but what I have enjoyed even more about the second season besides the fact that there are more episodes is the fact that they go on location a lot more and it brightens up the episode.

As they did in the first season a lot of the episodes focus on a member of the team in a side story to the episode or being involved in the actual story line and then there are a lot of episodes where the whole team is involved. A good mix of episodes.

Since I am a fan of Mark Shera and watch the show because of him, the episodes that feature his character, Dom Luca are my favorites. That said I can't think of any episode in this season that I have not enjoyed watching over and over again and look forward to seeing on DVD.

Update- Now that I have the actual DVD set, I can say that the quality on the episodes is good, right on par with the first season. One thing I really appreciate it that this final season set has chapter breaks which the first season put out by Sony did not. That makes a big difference. I definitely will be enjoying these episodes over and over.",1329004800,40,1693,4.102719033232629
5062895,5,B0077T5SOA,"""S.W.A.T."" was such a well-written, spectacular and electrifying action/crime drama television series about the adventures of a

Steve Forrest was perfect in the role of Lieutenant Dan 'Hondo' Harrelson.
Robert Urich was perfect in the role of Officer Jim Street.
Rod Perry was perfect in the role of Sergeant David 'Deacon' Kay.

James Coleman was perfect in the role of Officer T.J. McCabe.

His acting in this  episode is fantastic and realistic, and you're kept on the edge of your seat until  the end waiting to see if he's going to be shot -  or not.

It  is fun to watch a group of these episodes at one time to see how many scenes are re-used and how they are edited.

5062963,4,B0077T5SOA,"This police drama features the missions of LAPD's Special Weapons and Tactics team. They are a team of highly trained and heavily armed police officers who's purpose is to make coordinated assaults on armed and dangerous criminals in sensitive situations and defensible locations.  Unfortunately, even though SWAT was popular in the ratings, ABC canceled it in the Spring of 1976 during its 2nd Season due to the controversy it provoked concerning its violence.

S.W.A.T. was a favorite show that came out of the 70's and I still enjoy it as much today as I did back then since it was shown on TV Land for a month and was on Antenna TV for about a year, but I read all these reviews saying that the show doesn't transcend to today but I think that is totally wrong. Many teenage boys think the show is as cool as I did back in the 70's.

I only had a few complaints about this cop drama.
1)They would change details from 1 season to the next without explanation, such as in the first season TJ was engaged but in the 2nd Season, he was out dating again. That seemed to happen a lot on shows in the 70's.
2) SWAT always seemed to focus mainly on the character of Lt. Hondo(Steve Forrest). Each episode seemed to make him out to be the hero, instead of ever letting one of the other members of the team get any glory.

All in all I think this was a great TV show that never got the praise it deserved.",1389657600,7,1399,4.307984790874524

I can't believe this show was considered too violent.  Uh, try real lie.  LOL!!  But I so much enjoy the quality of the DVD and the sound.  Thank you for putting quality shows on DVD for us who prefer them.  Great acting, too.",1367625600,,402,4.0
5062977,4,B0077T5SOA,"HATED the SWAT movie because they changed ranks - think Hondo (Steve Forrest) went from Lieutenant to Sgt.

The show is obviously dated and people were a lot simpler
But maybe that's the appeal
In one episode, a crooked ex-Senator was allowed in the SWAT office, so he was able to get at witnesses
In another, the mob went for the DA's daughter (instead of the DA)

For me, this hankers back to the 70s - when TV was no brainer
Unlike some shows these days that try to be edgy by introducing all kinds of plots

If you watched it first time round and liked it, you probably still will
Unlike some shows, where the plots become unbelievable, this one's quite ok

Amazing though how 'light' the SWAT guys travlled
An M16/AR15 (for the non-sniper), a side-arm, a gas mask, a radio and a skein of rope

No captions but the dialogue's simple, so no big deal",1367107200,,852,4.367088607594937
5062978,5,B0077T5SOA,It was great! It had alot of acton. The plots were great! So was the cast. It had alot of cute guys on it.,1366156800,,106,3.4583333333333335
5062979,3,B0077T5SOA,"I was excited when they finally announced that this set was coming as S.W.A.T. was one of my favorite shows as a kid. However, I'm also hearing impared so I was pretty ticked off when I saw that this set wasn't closed captioned? How can any DVD these days not be captioned? VERY disappointed.",1361577600,6,292,4.425925925925926
5062980,5,B0077T5SOA,I loned the show and wish there had been more of the series instead of only the two seasons. It is a great tv cop show with lots of action and I would recommend it very strongly to all cop show fans.,1360368000,,199,3.761904761904762
5062981,5,B0077T5SOA,"Waited a long time for this to be released on DVD. It was worth the wait. I watched the show back in the mid '70s when it came out and it was always one of my faves. I became a fan of each cast member as the show progressed. I know the shows from that era are now dated, but it was nice to relive that part of my TV watching past! Many thanks to SHOUT FACTORY for recognizing the market for this great show. I know Robert Urich has passed on and I was a big fan of his work after S.W.A.T. as well as Mark Shera in Barnaby Jones. Wonder what the guys are up to these days..",1360195200,,572,3.775

5062984,5,B0077T5SOA,The episodes are interesting.  If you watch it you will see some actors that you recognize (e.g. Mister Drake from Cheers).  It has a very 1970s feel to it.,1357257600,,156,4.344827586206897

5062988,5,B0077T5SOA,"Watched SWAT years ago when it first came out - I was in college. The SWAT concept I suppose started in the '70s in Los Angeles. I think the show was poorly timed coming soon after the end of the Vietnam War and people were tired of violence.  The show was cancelled after just two seasons. Anyway I enjoyed watching the show again. Odd that Steve Forrest, the oldest, outlived at least one of the other cast members. Those methods/tactics were quite new then. The hostage thing had just begun. Saw the ""new"" version in the early 2000's but it wasn't the same.",1353024000,3,560,4.436893203883495
5062989,5,B0077T5SOA,"Here's something that I wanted to know but couldn't find the answers anywhere, so here are the answers.

1.  The episodes ""The Deadly Tide (Parts 1 and 2)"" and ""The Running Man (Parts 1 and 2)"" are presented here as feature-length movies, just as they were originally aired, not split into 2 seperate episodes as most of us remember them in syndication.

2.  The episode ""Time Bomb"", which was produced for season 1 but not aired until season 2, and which was included on the season 1 dvd, is NOT presented again on this set.

As far as I'm concerned, these were both the right answers.  Whatever your preferences, I hope this information is useful.  Enjoy!",1351209600,3,657,4.612068965517241

Thanks so much to SHOUT, and SWAT is great.  The music, sound effects, and everything is exactly what I remembered from when I was a little kid.

AWESOME!!",1342569600,2,340,4.333333333333333
5062991,5,B0077T5SOA,This was a good buy! A six disc set with 22 episodes in total. It was very enjoyable entertainment. I had enjoyed the first season of S.W.A.T. and waited a long time for the second and final season of S.W.A.T. to be released. This cast was excellent! I just wish that the series had not been so short lived. It would have been great to have seen the character development of this cast!,1341273600,3,385,4.287671232876712
5062992,5,B0077T5SOA,"Great series that sadly didn't last long due to outcry of  violence on tv at that time (but very tamed by today's measures)glad the second and sadly the last season was finally release after a 6 year gap between this and the first season release, the quality is quite good along with the sound, it even included the episode ""dangerous memories"" which was a unaired episode. I wish this set would have included the pilot episode which actually is a two part The Rookies episode, hopefully that series will come complete soon. This series brings back alot of memories of my childhood TV was so great back in the 70's and this series proves it again this is a must get along with the first season of this great short-lived but beloved series!!!!",1340496000,2,742,4.578947368421052
5062993,5,B0077T5SOA,"Finally, the rest of the SWAT episodes.  Loved the series growing up in the 70s, and still love it now.  Makes me laugh to recall how, at the time, critics panned it for being ""too violent"".  How do their little hearts survive what's on TV today?  Great to have it back.",1339804800,,270,4.235294117647059
5062994,5,B0077T5SOA,"I have been waiting for season two of SWAT for what, almost 9 years now. Its amazing how Sony has released many of these old shows on dvd, and then does not follow through and then Shout Factory has to pick up the rest. Well, at least season two was released, thats all that matters. Love me some SWAT, and season two delivers, just like season one does. Finally!",1339459200,,363,4.27536231884058
