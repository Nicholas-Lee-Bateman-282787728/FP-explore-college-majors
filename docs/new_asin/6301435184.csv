328331,4,6301435184,"""Shredder & Splintered"" (an obvious misnomer) is the last of the original 1987 mini-series. Shredder introduces the retro-mutagen ray (any clue what that thing does?) which he hopes to use on the boys in green. While Splinter is seeking for it, in hopes of being human again, the fab-four are busy battling top-side with a Gorganzolla-sized Krang (complete with a molecularly amplified body). Perfectly timed quips and jokes, enough action for any TMNT fan and a hilarious ending make this a satisfactory conclusion to the 1987 5-part pilot.

The next episode ""Return Of The Shredder"" (season 2's premier episode) pales in comparision to the aforementioned, hence the double-feature serves as a stark reminder of the decrease in quality this show suffered, in both writing, artwork, storyboards and voice acting after the '87 season. However, it should be noted that this is all fairly misleading as the rest of season 2 is mostly excellent and humorous (though not up to the 87 originals to be sure), ""Return of the Shredder"" just happens to be the least of the bunch by far. It suffers from an inane plot, lame and obvious humor and an irritating exploitation of stereotype bit characters that usually works in the show's favor. Story largely concerns Shredder's return to earth and plot to frame the awesome-foursome as criminals with his ""Crooked Ninja Turtle Gang"" who rob banks, jewelry stores, etc. while wearing green paper bags on their heads and shirts with iron-on shells on the back.

This video is my favorite out of all of the TMNT videos released. Which is funny because Leonardo isn't my favorite turtle Michaelangelo is my favorite turtle. My favorite episode on this tape is Leonardo Vs. Tempestra, which is the second episode on this tape. Leonardo Vs. Tempestra is my favorite episode out of the TMNT series. Leonardo Vs. Tempestra is the reason that I bought this video. If you have not seen this video I suggest buying it right now.",1050364800,5,582,4.5

328514,5,6301435184,"During Season 4 of the T.M.N.T. cartoon series in 1990, 41 episodes were released.  Furthermore, several of those episodes were featured on VHS showcasing each Turtle as the main star.  For example, Episodes #89 and #96 starred Donatello.  But on this package, Episodes #93 and #95 are all about Michaelangelo!  :)

Episode #93:  Michaelangelo Meets Bugman -- Master Splinter catches Michaelangelo reading a Bugman comic book and orders him to practice some ninja training.  However, when the electricity in the Turtles' Lair suddenly goes out, Michaelangelo goes back to reading his comics when he hears a distant scream from the sewers.  So when Mikey rescues the person, he finds out that the person is Bugman himself!

Brick Bradley -- a.k.a. Bugman -- explains to Michaelangelo about how he acquired his newfound powers in a genetics lab during a horrible accident.  And whenever Brick would become angry, he would turn into Bugman!  He further explains to Mikey that he was having a battle with his foe, Electro Zapper, when he brought out the one weakness that Bugman can't handle -- leastonite!  :(  Mikey then decides to team up with Bugman to take on the dastardly villain!

April O'Neil, meanwhile, is also at Electro Zapper's hideout trying to figure out why NYC's electricity keeps going out.  She doesn't even realize that the villain is listening to her conversation with her boss, Burne Thompson.  Once Michaelangelo and Bugman show up, they destroy the satellite listening device, much to Electro Zapper's chagrin.  April thinks that she's stumbled onto a comic book convention, but Mikey explains that she's looking at the real deal!

Electro Zapper and Bugman duke it out with a very intense battle, but April is caught in the crossfire and twists her ankle in the process, unable to move.  Unfortunately, Electro Zapper gets the upper hand and -- once again -- brings out the leastonite, effectively rendering Bugman's powers useless!  :(  Both Michaelangelo and Bugman are captured inside the villain's power plant, and he intends to sap the life force out of the 2 heroes!  Sadly, April is also stuck in her own predicament as a huge ring of fire surrounds her and she still can't move!  How will the other 3 Turtles rescue everyone in time and stop Electro Zapper??  Tune in to find out!!  :)

Episode #95:  What's Michaelangelo Good For? -- Michaelangelo brings his fellow bird, Pete, to the zoo veterinary hospital.  The person in charge, Dr. Jane Goodfellow, heals Pete's broken wing, but she can't understand how Michaelangelo and his bird bud are able to communicate to each other so well.  Later, the T.M.N.T. catch one of April O'Neil's news broadcasts about how some of the zoo animals have been mysteriously kidnapped right out of their cages!  :(

After the T.M.N.T. fix their broken Turtle Van, they decide to leave, but Michaelangelo wants to stay awhile for some more bird watching.  Unbeknownst to him, a huge submarine appears and 3 robots emerge.  They stop the Turtle Van cold, and so Leonardo, Donatello and Raphael are forced to tussle with them.  And Pete witnesses the entire event!  Unfortunately, the 3 Turtles are quickly overtaken and brought onto the submarine.

When Mikey returns to the Lair, Master Splinter warns him that something bad has happened to the other Turtles, so he decides to investigate.  Pete ""tells"" Michaelangelo about the fierce battle that occurred.  It is eventually revealed that Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael -- AND the kidnapped zoo animals -- have been captured inside a power plant on an offshore island!  But something rotten has happened to the creatures themselves -- they've been mutated and cross-bred!  :(  The person whom is responsible shows himself -- a crazy villain named Dr. Lesseau!

The cruel doctor reveals to the T.M.N.T. that he intends to make the ultimate creature that has the traits of ALL the other animals, but that he needs the Turtles' knowledge to make his dastardly plan complete!  Naturally, the T.M.N.T. refuse to cooperate, so Dr. Lesseau has one of his beasts take Donatello to an operating table.

Meanwhile, Michaelangelo and Dr. Goodfellow (whom still can't understand the relationship between Mikey and Pete) take a boat to the island, but they encounter many booby traps set by the wily doctor.  Somehow, they manage to make it onto the island and now have to fight off even more of Dr. Lesseau's crazy contraptions!  It will take a lot of cunning and skill from Mikey and the good doctor to rescue the other Turtles and force the mutated zoo animals to turn on their evil creator himself.  Eventually, Dr. Goodfellow comes to understand the important role that Pete played during the rescue and she thanks both the brave bird and Michaelangelo for a job well done.

As most T.M.N.T. fans know, a brand new chapter of the saga had started on Nickelodeon back in September 2012 and is still going strong.  Be sure to tune in every weekend!  :)",1418083200,,4954,4.945454545454545
328515,5,6301435184,"Greetings, fellow cartoon/T.M.N.T. fans!!  :)  These 2 episodes from the year 1990 were previously released on VHS cassette and can also be enjoyed on the 5 disc set of T.M.N.T. -- Season 4 (released in 2007).  These are Episodes #88 and #90, respectively.

Episode #88:  Shredder and Krang continue to become infuriated not being able to move the Technodrome out of Dimension X.  What's worse, a large piece of rigidium gets broken, and Krang needs to replace it.  But the biggest problem of all is when a huge egg crashes outside of the Technodrome.  When Shredder and the gang investigate it, out pops a purple Zipp!  But it's not as cute as it looks!  It starts eating the Technodrome's machinery!  :(  It takes several tries for Shredder to finally capture it.  He sends it through the trans-dimensional portal to wreak havoc in NYC.

Once the T.M.N.T. discover the Zipp, they also have to deal with the fallout.  When it eats Donatello's pizza invention, it multiplies into 2 -- oh no!!  :(  The Turtles are unable to stop the little beasts, especially when they hit the streets of NYC.  The T.M.N.T. realize that the Zipp's keep multiplying because they keep eating copper!!  They have to figure out a way to stop the Zipp invasion, so they try using chocolate.  The plan seems to work, reuniting 2 Zipp's back into one.  So the T.M.N.T. decide to hit the Ajax Candy Factory to unwrap a huge chocolate bar.  They manage to lure the Zipp's into the building.  Once they start chomping on the bar, the plan to reunite the critters does seem to work, until -- gasp! -- the lone Zipp becomes a King Kong size menace!!  :(

In the meantime, April and Irma have their own problems when Shredder uses his large transport tank to cut down the rigidium spire to Lofty Tower!  So how will the T.M.N.T. shrink the Zipp back to normal AND stop Shredder?!  Stay tuned to find out!!  :)

Episode #90:  Lotus Blossom returns for a second appearance (she also appeared in Episode #46:  Beware The Lotus).  She has a bad dream about Chaka Hatchi kidnapping her.  She realizes that the Turtles have something to do with her dream, so she goes to investigate.  Meanwhile, the T.M.N.T. witness 2 thieves making off with Chaka Hatchi's urn!!  They manage to foil the bandits, but they succeed in stealing the priceless pearl inside the urn!

When Shredder hears about the urn via April O'Neil's news report, he decides to steal the urn for himself.  He deceives Lotus into attacking the Turtles.  The ploy works, and she accuses them of dishonoring her clan.  The T.M.N.T. try to calm her down, to no avail.  After an intense battle, she finally listens when Leonardo offers to take her to the urn of Chaka Hatchi.  Master Splinter then explains that she was duped by Shredder -- i.e. that she DOESN'T have a clan at all!

The whole gang decide to take the urn back up to the streets of NYC, where they run into trouble with Bebop and Rocksteady.  Bebop manages to foil Lotus's primitive sword attack, and the 2 mutants wrestle with the Turtles and the urn.  When Raphael states that the urn is cursed, the 2 lamebrains accidentally SMASH the urn, releasing the spirit of Chaka Hatchi!!  :(  Chaka himself demands to know what happened to his mysterious pearl and uses his magic to turn NYC into his own world of ancient Japan!!

After Leonardo sets Lotus free, the 2 of them go to the thieves' Secret Hideout to take back the pearl.  Meanwhile, the T.M.N.T. now have to deal with Chaka's ferocious samurai warriors.  Unfortunately, they lose the battle and are forced to climb a telephone pole.  So it's up to both Leonardo and Lotus to give Chaka back the pearl and return NYC to it's former ""concrete jungle.""

These are 2 of my favorite episodes from Season 4, so please enjoy watching!!  :)",1402358400,,3781,4.625942684766215
328516,5,6301435184,"Since 1990, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was my go-to cartoon to watch every Saturday morning.  I actually watched the Dimension X episodes (Season 4) before the other seasons aired.  This particular set is part of Season 3 -- Episodes #61 and #62.  These are 2 of my favorites because of the overall storylines.

The first episode stars that miserable doctor/turned fly, Baxter Stockman!  This episode is his third appearance since Krang turned him into a fly back on Episode #12.  He comes across a pyramid-like building, only to find out that it's actually an alien spaceship -- and it even talks!  Krang is in need of a new power source to re-energize his Technodrome, so he sends Shredder and his two minions -- Bebop and Rocksteady -- to find some.  They find some components to an alien warp drive, which is supposed to power the alien spaceship.  They also soon come across their old nemesis Baxter, as well as the T.M.N.T.!  However, Baxter doesn't take too kindly to Shredder's appearance, so he immediately uses his Retro Mutagen Ray to turn Shredder into a fly -- yikes!!  And he also turns poor Michaelangelo into a Teenage Mutant Ninja Gerbil.

So it's up to the Turtles to save the day!  After they manage to stop Baxter and turn Michaelangelo back to normal, Baxter manages to get away in the alien spaceship.  But not so fast, folks!  Baxter is missing an important component on his way to Dimension X -- and doesn't get the chance to arrive there!  Instead, the spaceship comes apart and he lands inside a dimensional limbo, about to be eaten by a giant spider!!  Yes, he will rise again in future episodes, so he will cheat death -- this time.

In Episode #61, ""Shredderville"", the T.M.N.T. wonder what NYC would be like without their existence.  They soon get their wish, as their Lair does not even exist, and their 2 friends, April and Irma, don't even KNOW the Turtles!  In fact, they are Bebop and Rocksteady's harem girls -- WHAT?!  When the T.M.N.T. go to the surface, they notice that NYC is in complete disrepair.  Even worse, the Technodrome -- which is actually on Earth -- is in disarray and inoperable.  So the T.M.N.T. turn to Krang for help, but even HE doesn't know what to do!  It's now the Turtles' job to find Shredder and make him pay.  But he's not so confident being the emperor of NYC, now is he?!  Without Krang's assistance, he can't even rule the city!

Eventually, at the end of the episode, the T.M.N.T. will wake up and realize that everything was just a dream.  Ah, sweet memories.  These are definitely 2 great episodes that hardcore T.M.N.T. fans should watch or download onto their tablets.  And don't forget to turn into the brand new T.M.N.T. series, which is currently on Nickelodeon, Sundays at 11 a.m.  You don't want to miss out!!  :)",1393286400,,2792,4.6462167689161555
