You can see this movie again and again",1357344000,,121,4.304347826086956
5408621,5,B00AB685UK,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It moves me.  Even though I need the subtitles, I identify the main characters with family members.  I am touched, often to the verge of tears.  That doesn't happen much with me, so you know it is a great movie. Seller was good.  Only drawback is the total shipping time from the UK.  I would definitely recommend this movie to others and would recommend the supplier sdu123 as well.
Thanks for providing this.",1356652800,12,455,4.487804878048781
5408622,5,B00AB685UK,"One of the best Bollywood films ever, unlike recent films it is far from superficial, a deep thought provoking film that inspires u to treat ppl better regardless of any language barriers.",1356480000,3,188,4.90625
5408623,5,B00AB685UK,"Wow, this movie is so beautifully put together - its breathtaking!  It's easy to get completely wrapped up in the storyline although still hard to watch how this woman's family put her down for her inability to speak English (I found a lot of little life lessons that can be taken away from this story - ie: To be understanding of those that seem ""different"" than whats perceived as normal, to think about what we're saying to those that we love, to respect people from all walks of life).  Despite all the poking fun of, the lack of time that her husband has for her & the disrespect her daughter shows ... this woman is a woman in every sense of the word - She's vibrant, smart, caring, loving, compassionate & gentle.  She has a childlike innocence to her, coupled with passion & inner strength to find & love herself.  There are a lot of comedic scenes that will have you laughing & It's clean so, your whole family will be able to enjoy together (it will be hard for anyone who cannot read the subtitles to get the full idea that's being conveyed). I seen that this movie became available on DVD although it wasn't easy to find ... I didn't see a lot of publicity for it other than Flixter saying when it was being released. It was totally worth the effort to locate this movie ... it will be one to watch again!",1355011200,49,1317,4.341463414634147
5408624,5,B00AB685UK,"English-Vinglish deserves all its critical and commercial success. It's full of gentle humor and warm family feeling. Sridevis acting is nuanced, believable and touching. (And shes extraordinarily beautiful.) The rest of the actors are also excellent. Plus theres a delightful surprise cameo by one of Indias greatest actors. Now that I know the story, I watch it without subtitles to focus on the actors in the backgrounds and their reactions. Looking forward to writer/director Gauri Shindes next, Dear Zindagi.",1469577600,,513,5.506329113924051

5408638,2,B00AB685UK,I adore this movie but my DVD arrived damaged.  The movie kept skipping especially during my favorite part - The wedding scene.  I tried cleaning the DVD but it did not improve the quality. The DVD was played on a DVD player that is only 2 months old.,1439164800,,251,4.208333333333333
5408639,4,B00AB685UK,"Definitely recommended. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I personally think 5 stars should be an extraordinarily good film. This is certainly a good movie with lots of heart, a winning heroine and good character development, with insight into the frustrations of someone who is a non-native English speaker that I think would be useful for any other Americans out there like myself who speak only English. It just doesn't hae quite enough 'oomph' to push it into the 5 start category for me.

SPOILERS:
Cute movie about an Indian mother who was being mocked and treated cruelly by her family simply because she wasn't fluent in English. An extended trip to Manhattan allows her what is potentially her first real taste of freedom, and with that, an opportunity to improve her English, a source of shame and frustration in her life at this point,  thru a ""Learn English in ----"" cram course. The rest of the film follows her struggles both to learn the language, but mostly her interactions with her classmates and family, and her personal decision if she wishes to continue the life she's always known or branch out into becoming an independent woman. And of course the conflict the return of her family bring to this internal debate.",1437696000,2,1253,4.7695852534562215

5408649,5,B00AB685UK,"The storyline itself is not very original and the title may not be very appealing, but English Vinglish is a charming comedy drama from India that will make you smile and happy.

This is an Indian movie, but most of the story takes place in New York City, where the films heroine Shashi Godbole (Sridevi), housewife of two children, flies to attend her sisters wedding. Shashis marriage has been a happy one, but her husband Satish (Adil Hussain), though loving his wife, does not appreciate her skills of making laddu (popular ball-shaped sweets). Worse, he even makes fun of Shashis English.

After a humiliating experience at a coffee shop (one of the most impressive scenes of the film), Shashi decides to take an English course. In the class she meets students from a variety of backgrounds, including a young French chef Laurent (Mehdi Nebbou), who is obviously interested in her  romantically.

The films greatest asset is the star Sridevi, who has returned to screen after a 15-year hiatus. She is credible and likable as a heroine who regains her self-confidence through what she experiences in New York. Indian superstar Amitabh Bachchan also appears briefly and his interaction with Sridevi is fun to see.

Written and directed by Gauri Shinde (her feature debut), English Vinglish is a warm and life-affirming film. Some supporting characters tend to be stereotypical, but the presence of Sridevi makes up for the flaws.",1422662400,,1432,5.025316455696203

I think it should be marketed differently.  If I had known this about it, I would probably not have purchased it.  Things sold in America should fit our market.",1401408000,,300,3.966666666666667

5408667,5,B00AB685UK,LOVED this movie. When all seems against the heroine she shows them all. Good for her. The story concerns an Indian housewife whose husband and family take her for granted. Coming to the U.S. for her niece's wedding she enrolls in an English class and meets people of different nationalities and finds her place. Her speech towards the end is great. Amitabh Bachchan makes a cameo earlier on and as usual he steals the show. Love Sridevi. love Amitabh.,1393459200,2,452,4.734177215189874

but out of curiosity I've been meaning to watch
something featuring this ""Sridevi"" I keep hearing
about - yet strangely is NEVER heard about here
(U. S. of A.) except by those with Indian affiliations
such as Pakistanis (they speak the same language)
so I was on an airplane and lo and behold one of the
movie selections starred this Stunner and it takes place
in ""the"" U. S. A. ( lol:) ) to top it off.  So I paid the $8.00
to watch it, and all I can say is NO ONE is underrated if
not this Sridevi.  Really this is what ""movie star"" looks &
acts like.  Anyway I just watched it because of her and
she does not disappoint for a sec, but the story line is
gripping too, enough so that I didn't feel it to be a 2 hr
long movie at all.  In fact I just found out it's over 2 hrs
long just now on amazon.  I am on here looking to pur-
chase this movie.  I don't know if this review helps but

5408679,5,B00AB685UK,"That basically sums up this entire movie. It's a nearly perfect inspirational movie. The script is fantastic, the performances superb in every way, and the film itself is lovingly and thoughtfully crafted with every shot. Srideviji was a revelation! Who knew that under the chiffon saris of Yash Chopra a subtle, elegant, and compelling actress could turn in such a realistic and incredible performance! She truly became the character in every way. I didn't see even one moment of ""acting"" in the entire movie. She was literally perfect! I really hope she makes another film soon. The supporting cast was equally good, from the family, to the classmates, to the strangers we run into (major kudos for Mr. Bachchan's cameo) and all blend into a harmonious mixture to make a fantastic film. Please, don't deny yourself the experience.

I do have one minor quibble (SPOILER), and that is that although the film did an admirable job in creating what a Manhatten class demographic looks like in 2012 having the gay teacher, go through a breakup and then discovering one of the students is also gay was just totally unnecessary. Not to mention way too obvious and convenient. I understand the tolerance message but I personally felt it could have been done in a less obvious way.",1380499200,3,1273,4.893518518518518

It was very real as it portrayed the struggles of a mother who worked hard and sacrificed herself for her family but was under-valued by her children and husband.  When she had the opportunity to educate herself with English, she discovered new positive things in life. She also stayed loyal to her marriage when she could have easily made another decision when she was shown tenderness from an outsider that she did not receive at home.

Through her short journey during her stay on the east coast of the USA, she learned new things about herself and grew as a person. She also became more assertive.  Her husband and daughter especially had a good lesson to learn.

The speech at the end of the movie that the main character gives at the wedding was heart-wrenching and touching.  The plot was done well. The movie had good comedy and also tear jerking moments.",1378166400,,902,4.6415094339622645

5408685,5,B00AB685UK,"I saw this film as a feature at the Berkshire International Film Festival in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, in Western Massachusetts and LOVED the film. When I love a film, I have to own it so I was thrilled to learn it is available on DVD and bought it at once from Amazon.com.  It's a shame the film wasn't picked up in huge distribution but I am sure it will gain the fan club it deserves as people find it on DVD.

The story is about an upper class charming Indian wife whose family takes her for granted in so many ways and shows little respect for her special qualities and talents and the day-to-day things she does for her husband and 2 young children. When her sister's daughter, who lives in New Jersey, announces she's getting married, the leading lady flies to America to spend 5 weeks helping her sister and niece get everything organized for this big Indian-American wedding.

The funniest scene I have ever seen  that takes place in an airplane is captured in 'English Vinglish!"" You will never forget it. Just hysterical!

The film is very funny but at the same time it's a poignant tale of how travelers experience the world when they enter strange territory without a command of the language in the foreign destination. The film is an insider's look at experiences of travelers who interface with those who are rude, impatient, unfriendly, and intolerant as well as those who are warm, welcoming, helpful, cooperative and perform random acts of kindness and friendship for people they will only interface with for moments or minutes.

The experiences of the leading lady, a gorgeous and well-known actress in India who does a great job portraying the character, are the kinds of experiences all travelers have in foreign territory and great lessons in compassion and friendliness lie within the sub-story of the film.

The characters from India speak Hindi and the lead character speaks almost no English. Her motivation to learn English during her 5 week stay in America is the nucleus around which her experiences evolve in the film.

I think that the impatience of general audiences with reading subtitles may be one of the reason this film did not get picked up for major distribution. About 50% of the film is in Hindi with subtitles but even in those parts English is infused. The rest of the film is in English.

Like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" this film deserves to reach a general audience and, like that film, provides insights into the cultural uniqueness of this family on both sides of the ocean.

Since I bought the film, barely a month ago, I have viewed it 4 times when we've invited friends over for Movie and a Pizza Night at our house! Everyone has loved it and so was so pleased by our choice.

I had the pleasure of meeting the two producers of the film at the Berkshire International Film Festival and was so happy to have the chance to talk about the film with them and to congratulate these two very young women on their achievement.

Be sure you watch the film right through to the end of the credits as you'll see some impromptu dancing in the unexpected snow storm that hit NJ in October when they were about to film the wedding reception scene! We were told that they had to shovel the snow off the grass and try to dry the grass in order to keep their film schedule in tact. You might remember that freak snowstorm in October not that long ago!

This film is a wonderful place to start a discussion on bullying (as the leading lady was bullied by her daughter and husband) and on welcoming and assisting strangers and newcomers to your community.

What a FABULOUS little film! An excellent cast, with an excellent premise about a beautiful woman from India--touchingly portrayed by the lovely Sridevi, in the kind of attractively vulnerable role often played by Julia Roberts-- who is taken for granted by her family, who treat her with derision for her inability to speak English.
When she is sent alone to New York by her disrespectful husband, to perform a family duty, she is seen with new eyes by her fellow students in an English school in Manhattan, who recognize her as the gem that she is.
 The gorgeous Mehdi Nebbou--who was riveting in Steven Spielberg's ""Munich""--is excellent as Laurent, the hunky French English student who falls for her--and gives her inattentive husband a serious run for his money.
A bevy of charming cousins completes the cast, all the way to a heartwarming surprise finale. This is a very smart feel-good movie with a happy ending, with lots of beautiful Indian clothes and dancing. But it is also an excellent family film--for any age group or ethnicity--about family dynamics, and the need for spouses and children to respect and appreciate one another. And as Sridevi says, in her triumphant English speech, not be ""judgmental.""
I'll look for this director--and I think this remarkable actress could seriously carry a meaty role in another independent film.",1370908800,11,1523,5.067729083665339

5408690,5,B00AB685UK,"My wife is in this country 3 years from Siberia Russia.  One day out of the blue she asked me for an Hindi film. After a brief research I chose ""English Vinglish,"" we loved it!  Afterwards, I shared it with my family: My mom, sister and four nieces, they all loved it!",1370822400,2,268,4.134615384615385
5408691,5,B00AB685UK,"I guess, one day, Sridevi Kapoor - but just ""Sridevi"" will do, thank you - surveyed her demesne and decided to heck with her fifteen year hiatus from cinema. I think I'm on firm footing when I say that I'd put Sridevi's scintillating performance in English Vinglish against whichever other best you can come up with for 2012.

It's a crap title, but that's the only negative thing I can think of about the  movie. In an ocean of redundancy, English Vinglish surges against the tides. Does it add flavoring to learn that writer/director Gauri Shinde made the film in part as an apology to her mother, on whom she based the central character? Like the character's daughter, Gauri as a child was embarrassed of her mom's poor grasp of English. And here we were some years back, hailing Esperanto as the universal language.

In India, Shashi Godbole (Sridevi) is a dedicated housewife and devoted mother, never mind that she's marginalized by her husband (a smug Adil Hussain) and ridiculed by her daughter (Navika Kotia) for her provincial ways and for her inability to speak proper English. Shashi is a gifted cook who runs a modest business making and selling sweets to the neighborhood, an enterprise her husband looks down on. Y'know, here's a fella that's begging for an earnest asskicking.

The plot really kicks off when Shashi's older sister calls from New York asking for help in preparing for her daughter's impending nuptials. Picture Shashi in panic mode now, especially since she must fly for the first time and fly alone because the rest of her family aren't urgently needed and will meet her in New York in several weeks.

English Vinglish is mostly shot on location in New York, and it's there that Shashi embarks on her transformative journey. Okay, that's not right. It actually starts on that plane when Shashi ends up seated next to an obliging elderly gent (Amitabh Bachchan) who guides her thru the strange workings of an arduous international flight. For the duration of his brief cameo, Amitabh's helpful passenger does his darndest to enable Shashi.

It's not a film that sweeps you with the highest of stakes, and yet the scenes that play out are no less devastating. It's absorbing stuff, eyeballing this simple woman as she tries to cope in a scary, unfamiliar environment. I wonder, will you cringe in heartbreak like I did at the coffee shop scene as a thoroughly intimidated Shashi is braced by an aggressive counter clerk? Sridevi is so damn good. She reinforces that bit of wisdom that simple does not equate to stupid. Moments after this crushing scene, a gutted Shashi Godbole glimpses a bus ad claiming to teach paying students how to speak English in four weeks.

We track each of the hesitant choices Shashi makes, the small steps she takes to change herself, and we celebrate her incremental moments of triumph, until finally we arrive at that scene in which she navigates the bustling New York avenues with confident strides, handbag breezily flung over one shoulder. That scene makes me beam.

Gauri Shinde, who'd previously made short films and advertising spots, makes her feature film directorial debut, and it's a self-assured one. I guess we're waiting to see if she's a one-hit wonder. For now she's being lauded universally, and it's well-deserved. English Vinglish was such a pleasure to watch, a Bollywood feature that sharply separates itself from the homogenized efforts that sprinkle the breadth of Indian cinema. Shinde has crafted an unerring picture, inhabited by gentle humor and keen insight and emotional beats that run the gamut of gut-wrenching to uplifting. It's Gauri and Sridevi's potent shoutout to the hope and the dream of the Indian woman as a figure that retains dignity and is respected and cherished and treated as a peer. And who can make a kickass plate of ladoo.

5408700,5,B00AB685UK,"The pressure to speak English has been immense in a country with a colonial past that is India. Speaking it perfectly is necessary for survival.
In English Vinglish, Ad maker Gauri Shinde, brings to life the story of Shashi a shy housewife, who has been struggling to gain the respect of her daughter ( a spoilt brat) and her husband Adil Hussain because she hardly speaks any English. A wedding in America allows her to travel to America and inspires her to attend English classes.
Shashi in the film is the homemaker, slaving selflessly and endlessly in the kitchen while the needs of her mother in law, her husband and her children are met. She is also entrepreneurial - selling ladoos (popular Indian deserts) but that is not an asset because no one cares for this skill, all they care is that she cannot converse in English.
A well written script brings out the actress in Sridevi at every turn, whether she is explaining plantain chips in front of a visibly shocked daughter, or breaking into a gig or stunning viewers with a monologue in English towards the end of the movie. The script serves the actress in Sridevi. It is impossible to make a comeback after staying away for almost two decades but Sri manages it without any problems. She is better than ever and is refreshing and surprisingly at the top of her game after being away for so long. I am convinced that acting has muscle memory after watching Sridevi emote.
While watching the film, some of us may feel that too much fuss is being made about the main characters inability to speak English but the movie is not about that, it is about the small triumphs and the journey of Shashi with and without her family.
I highly recommend this film, and I believe this is one of the best films of 2012. Five stars. 2/15/2013",1363737600,5,1785,4.56386292834891

A charming story matched up with a great cast saved this from being a total laugh, it was filmed in several languages at once and the strain of pulling all of that together shows.  Several times the actors forget what language they are supposed to be using, and amazingly Shashi seems to pick up French somewhere along the way.

My 19 year old son happened to be in the house when the movie was on and even he commented that it was a decent flick, but I think he was more amazed that the actress playing Shashi was 49.

While I had no problem paying full price for the Blu-ray, I imagine that most would want to wait for the price to drop, or the film becomes available for rent.

5408711,4,B00AB685UK,"Although 'English Vinglish' is a hindi-language film, it far from feels like a hindi film, rather, it feels more like an English film; the emotions, the way they are delivered, the screenplay, these sort of things don't really fit in with the feeling on the usual Hindi film. The music feels like English or European folk music, with Hindi lyrics, no Shehnai's, big strings, sitars or dramatic vocal chorus.

This is an absolutely stellar performance by Sri Devi, especially if you've seen some of her older films, for example, I've seen her in 'Lahme', where she was very cheeky and danced a lot. Here she is an emotionally bereft middle aged lady who clearly lacks respect in her life.

She takes up English classes to try and learn the language that, without knowing, is depriving her respect from her closest relatives (as her husband always says, 'Shashi was born to make Ladoo'). There she meets some interesting people and she goes on an emotional roller-coaster ride, especially trying to evade the omnipresent Laurent, played by Mehdi Nebbou who also puts in a great performanc, and making friends with other people who are struggling with English.

I didn't like the movie so much because of it's emotional attachment to the struggles of those people who can't speak English, I didn't realise people cared so much about that, but I liked it because it's an enjoyable film to watch and because of good acting and a good storyline, and Amitji's cameo is a blast too!

5408713,5,B00AB685UK,"This is a very quiet movie that makes a huge impact on those who watch it. I love Bollywood movies and love that this was actually a heroine focused movie which isn't as common in Bollywood movies as it is in Hollywood movies.

From the beginning we meet Shashi, who is a wife and mother of two children (girl and boy), she also makes ladoos and sells them to those around her neighborhood. I've never had ladoos, but I'm dying to try one now! Her husband is very dismissive of her and we see that when she mispronounces an English word, we also see this dismissiveness when she calls him to tell him how many ladoos she sold that day and he says he is busy and can't talk to her. From the title of the movie we can tell that Shashi has a problem with English. She must go to her daughter's PTA meeting and bumbs into a mother of her daughter's friend, who begins to talk to her in English. Shashi just nods her head and her daughter jumps into the conversation. This gives us a glimpse that she is not fluent in English and that her daughter is embarrassed by this fact. After the PTA meeting we see Shashi's daughter being rude to her for not knowing English and talking to her teacher in Hindi. It is heartbreaking to she Shashi start to cry a little on the ride back to the house. We can see how lonely she is and how her family pays her little respect. It seems her only joy comes from making her sweets which is her solace from her family.

Then the call comes from Shashi's sister who lives in New York, to tell that her eldest daughter is getting married to an American. Her husband decides that Shashi will go a few weeks ahead of the family to help her sister with the preparations. Shashi is very upset with this decision since she does not know English or how to get around, but her husband doesn't seem too concerned that he is sending his wife to an entirley different country than her own. I admire that she does get on the plane to go to America, that takes a lot of courage to go to a country where you do not know the langugae. The scene on the plane, where Amitabh Bachchan is her seat mate, is extremely funny, as he translates the English movie to Hindi for her. Laugh out loud fun! When she gets to New York disaster is soon to follow when Shashi's niece takes her to a park to wait for her to get done with her classes for the day. Shashi deciedes to go to a cafe for some food. The cashier is rude and frustrated that Shashi doesn't speak English and the end result is Shashi without lunch and in tears on a bench.

After this moment she decides to learn English and she enrolls in a four week course. She ends up having to get to the Language Center all by herself, and I admire that she was determined to do it. The scenes of her learning English with the other students is very sweet and funny, and I love the teacher who is very eccentric. There are some very sweet moments between Shashi and the other students as they all struggle to learn this complicated langugae. We can see Shashi becoming more and more confident as the classes go on, and she enjoys this new part of her life. But it is cut short when her family arrives early for the wedding and she is not able to go to the last couple of classes. After an important scene (I won't say what happens) she becomes very upset with herself for putting so much focus on her English lessons when that was not the reason for her being there. She feels that she has failed as a mother for forgetting her responsibilities. I won't give the rest of the movie away but it is beautiful.

What I find wonderful about this movie is how many lessons can be learned from it. I think this movie encourages us to look at how we are treating those who are close to us. We are hurt when Shashi is put down by her family, and it makes us take a look at our own life and see who we may be putting down unecessarily. I think this movie also encourages us to do things we are scared of doing. Shashi is terrified by New York, and by learning English, but she does it and it gives her confidence to stand up for herself. As a native-English speaker this movie helped me realize that English is not easy to learn, and it is very hard to foriegners who are new to America. We see Shashi try to figure out how the langugae works, and we watch her struggle to get around New York and around with people who she cannot communicate with. It helped me realize that being in a completely different country and culture is extremely hard if you are not used to it.

Sridevi had a spectacular performance for not having acted in 15 years. She is stunning as Shashi. The emotions she portrays break our hearts and make us smile as we watch her grow in this foriegn country. She is a brilliant actress who embodies her characters fully. This character was made for her.

This is a non-traditional Bollywood movie but it is no less than those movies with dancing and singing. It it a beautiful story of a woman truely figuring herself out in this new world.

8549691,3,B00AB685UK,"Honestly, I only watched this after hearing of Sridevi's untimely passing.  The reviews were really good for this movie so I had high expectations. Having since watched it, I didn't think it was that great and here is my reasoning.

I think this still falls under Bollywood film even though the story is westernized for the most part.  As a result, I didn't catch any English subtitles.  If you can't understand Hindi, you're going to miss 75% of the movie.  You can still follow along and the English parts will fill in the gaps but a movie like this needs subtitles.  Maybe it has subtitles and I just missed them but I looked for a while until deciding to watch it without them.

Overall, I just felt the story was a little stale.  Sridevi's acting was good but a little too ""Indian cinema"" for this type of film.  I don't know if that makes sense but Indian acting is good for strictly Indian movies and westernized acting is more appropriate for westernized-themed films.  Indian films overall are more ""wholesome"" and western films can vary in their content drastically.  I'm saying this as an Indian-American who has an appreciation for both types of film.  For example, there is a quasi-intimate scene between Sridevi and one of the other characters and I found that scene and the overall dynamics of that relationship to be cringe-worthy in it's ability to convey any emotions shared between the two characters.  In a Bollywood film, the female character would come close to something resembling a kiss and then break out into song and dance but in this movie, she tries to respond like a westernized woman would...by thinking about it, getting confused, and then running away from the scene lol.  It doesn't work here with her running away in a sari though.  I also thought the  ""relationship"" was in poor taste because the director failed to show a REAL conflict in the character's marriage and family life.  This is more of a drama/comedy and the director is trying to inject a possible extra-marital element into it and it fails miserably IMO.

I actually did not understand how the relationship between Shahshi and the other person contributed to the main story of the film.  The story begins one way, it takes a slight turn in the middle, but in the end finishes how it started with no real resolution of the romantic part in the middle and no real resolution overall.  I did not understand how Shashi's English class made her any better because the film really does not go into that; it just ends.  That's how a lot of Indian movies work though; some have a really good story and some leave you scratching your head with the ending.  That rarely happens with a western film as I feel all western films are written and edited much better than Indian films. This film could have actually been a lot better if it focused more on either the dynamics of the English class and how that transforms Shashi, Shashi's marriage and family dynamics, or the relationship that Shashi encounters.  Instead, the director wants to focus on a little bit on all of them for a two-hour film.

This might be a good movie by Bollywood standards but I think if you're comparing it to mainstream films, it's not really a good movie... think Slumdog Millionaire.  I personally didn't care for that film either.  Your opinion viewpoint might be different however.",1519689600,,3353,4.708404802744425

8549693,5,B00AB685UK,"Just from watching a quick run-through of this film now being offered through Eros Now, here on Amazon, it looks like a 5 Star film. Unfortunately I cant watch it because despite being stated as having English subtitles, it DOES NOT. The only option for subtitles is not English, maybe Arabic? Ive found other films as well on the Eros Now channel that say they have English subtitles, but when you open the subtitle box, the options are locked and no option for English is present. Its not my iPad or Amazon settings, because I am able to view many other international films just fine. While there appear to be many Hindi films available on Amazon with working English subtitles, the absence of number of these (check it out) that are clearly advertised as having them, but do not, is really frustrating. I don't speak Hindi or any other Indian languages so I cant enjoy these films without subtitles. I don't think Im alone in moving into Indian films almost exclusively, as an alternative to the overwhelmingly disappointing offerings from Hollywood these days. I spoke with amazon customer service but they didn't seem to have a clue about doing anything to fix this, or much interest in doing so. Im really glad Amazon is offering so many more of these films but I hope theyll take notice that there are many of us who won't subscribe to an international service if they don't have enough English subtitles.",1515196800,3,1412,4.720647773279352
8549694,4,B00AB685UK,"I purchased this film because I thought Amitabh Bachchan was in it--but his role was disappointingly brief, just in the beginning, and then he disappears for the rest of the movie.  Not fair to Bachchan's fans at all.  However, this is still a well-done and engrossing film.  It's certainly worth your time.",1507248000,,307,4.865384615384615
8549695,5,B00AB685UK,"I loved this movie. This is not a Bollywood musical. It is about an East Indian woman who comes to New York with her son and can't speak English. You really empathize with this character as she feels cut off from everyone because of the language barrier. She wanders around New York and finds an English class for people where English is a second language. As she learns English and meets people in class who are in the same boat so to speak, she starts to grow, make friends and find her place in American society. It is uplifting and character driven. The script is well-written and the acting is excellent.",1500768000,2,609,4.495495495495495
