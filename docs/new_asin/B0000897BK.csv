If you have ever been on a tour bus...this will get your laugh lines more pronounced.  It is wonderful what films you can make WITHOUT much in the way of special effects.  The things that happen...
I have been dying to get my hands on a copy to show my US friends...now if they could only put THE MAN WHO SUED GOD on Region 1 DVD!!!
Enjoy...",1043625600,5,456,4.27906976744186
7980281,5,B0000897BK,"One of my favorite Australian comedies.  The gags come out of nowhere and take you by surprise, like the title of the meathead's song, what's behind the door at The Butterfly house, and the gas station owner's first line (all his lines, actually.)  Extremely funny.  I had to stop and rewind several times due to laughing attacks.  Another obscure, hilarious, Australian black comedy is The Cars That Ate Paris",1504915200,,410,4.898550724637682
7980282,1,B0000897BK,"I just love the work of Linus Roache, which is why I bought this terrible movie.  It is any good at all.  You are not missing a thing to pass it up.",1424304000,,148,3.59375

7980286,3,B0000897BK,"Not happy with it,it kept hesitating through the whole movie, but you get what you pay for.",1275264000,,91,4.411764705882353
7980287,4,B0000897BK,"A few surface situations affecting several persons combine to make this film a beautifully blended mix of drama, melodrama, comedy with a few touches of sexual undertone.  Linus Roache burns up the screen with his casual ""slinkiness"" and smoldering masculinity.  He keeps the ""eye candy"" level up high and heated.

I know I'll keep this film handy for reshowing.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this excursion into ""fantasyland.""",1256342400,2,434,5.246376811594203
7980288,1,B0000897BK,"It's a nice movie, I knew that before buying, having seen it on TV. My rating would be four stars if it were about the movie. The DVD itself, however--that's a different story.

I bought it as a gift for a friend last year. Today I got to see the DVD unsealed, and it's not a professionally made DVD. It is not a disc pressed in a  factory, it's just a CD-R ripped and burned on a computer! And even that would be tolerable, except that the image quality is really very poor, the worst DVD I've seen by far. It looks every bit like a pirated copy.

It's too late now to return the DVD, and, like I said, it was already presented as a gift. Some gift!

I see that the movie is now available in a new release, which came out after I bought this one. If you have to have the movie, buy the other one. You might have better luck.",1232236800,,825,3.981818181818182
7980289,5,B0000897BK,"I recommend this highly. Very clever, funny - well done! (I won't go into plot details - others have, already.) (Some reviewers here should be SHOT for giving away the important plot details!)

The reviewers who have told the plot details should have their reviews REMOVED by Amazon. Reviewers who give away plot details should not be allowed to write comments/reviews on Amazon. They ruin the film for others, by telling too much.",1101772800,4,431,4.904109589041096
7980290,5,B0000897BK,"This is just another great film by Linus Roache.  His wife is killed in a freak space debris accident.  He gets depressed, and wins a trip to Australia, and discovers life all over again.  It is a quirky trail with some not so average tourists on a bus trip through the Australian continent.  He meets a woman and eventually falls for her.  They buy a place to run and settle in the hot desert Outback of Australia.  The film is full of funny incidents, and twists.  You get to see more of why thespian Linus Roache is a favorite of mine.",1099526400,,538,4.267326732673268
