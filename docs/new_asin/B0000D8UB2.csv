1921341,5,B0000D8UB2,"Some friends and I got together and decided dthe only way we'd ever exercise was if we all did it at the same time. We started out with aerobics but it was so boring we decided we'd try tap dancing instead. What a hoot--or should I say, hoof. Ginger is sensational and we've all gotten so good, we're thinking about putting on a show for our husbands!

1921342,5,B0000D8UB2,"I used to reserve Ginger's tap workshops at the library because they were easily the best workouts available until I discovered that everybody else had found out the same thing and were reserving them as well. This meant that sometimes I would have to wait weeks to get the tapes and my dancing in the meanwhile was going, quite simply, nowhere. I then decided the best investment would simply be to go ahead and buy them for myself. I couldn't have, literally, made a better move. Besides the fact Ginger is the most adorable woman this side, or any side, of the Atlantic, and a fabulous dancer, her instructions and demonstrations are very clear, so even if you have never put on a pair of tap shoes (which I hadn't), you would be able to follow them all the way from the basic shuffle to a stun-all-your-friends shim-sham. I have now worked up through the Beginner tape to the middle of the Intermediate one and have even peeked ahead to the Advanced One to see if the quality of instruction is the same, and it's quite simply head of the class all the way. If you've ever wanted to be Gene Kelly or Ginger Rogers--or better yet, Ginger of Paris--here's your chance.",1110758400,51,1169,4.518867924528302
1921343,5,B0000D8UB2,"EASY TAP LEARNING FOR ALL LEVELS STUDENTS

This DVD is an excellent introduction to Tap.

2 excellent features: The way it is filmed from the back, just like a real tap class, which make it easy to learn and follow along.

Also the 4 repetitions of each step and the additional 3 repetitions with music, this helped me to nail each step, one at a time.

When one of the step seemed challenging, hey, that is part of learning,

I just slowed down the image! I think any DVD player can do it. So I used this function when ever necessary.....

This 4 hour long instructional Tap DVD has given me month's free lessons and enjoyment.

1921344,2,B0000D8UB2,"I have Bonnie Franklin's Let's Tap and, to me, she is a much better teacher than Ginger.  Bonnie demonstrates facing you and does the steps totally backwards (her left leg for your right, so it is like looking in a mirror -- quite impressive) and it is so much easier to follow.  Ginger initially shows the steps facing away from you so you can't see what her feet are doing. For someone who doesn't know a fl-lap from a shuffle, it is very difficult to figure out what she is doing.  When she does turn around for the faster sections, her legs are opposite yours. Also, the music is quite bad. NOT for beginners!  An advanced tap dancer might get a lot out of it though.",1077408000,17,671,4.301587301587301
1921345,5,B0000D8UB2,"EDITORIAL REVIEW FROM BOOKLIST MAGAZINE -JANUARY 2004 ISSUE
ONE OF THE 3 TOP LIBRARY MAGAZINES IN AMERICA-
Tap with Ginger. Golden Treasures. 2003. 4hr. DVD $44.95
A competent tap dance teacher shows wannabes various dance steps while voice over narration (spoken in a slight European accent) explains techniques and movements. The instructor stands on a raised dance floor, initially facing viewers before turning her back so the camera can record her foot movements. The steps are repeated four times and the beat is counted out. Music accompanies the fourth repeat. Viewers can choose beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels with 15 steps included in each. Shuffles, flaps, slides, paddle rolls, trills, rolling steps, riffs, and pull-backs are among the demonstrated steps. The DVD also features a tap dance dictionary and review lessons. This no frills, well-executed instructional is suggested for dancers at all levels. --Nancy McCray",1073520000,23,945,5.524137931034483
1921346,2,B0000D8UB2,"Hi!
First, I have bought all the three videos of Ginger. If the DVD's are the same then this applies (I believe they are):
1. These are not for novices. But if you are taking step lessons at same time then please read on:
2. There are good and bad things (as always):
3. Good things: You can ensure your that your tapping steps are right. In active lessons it is usually very difficult to get everything right. In these (videos) you can check that what you must actually use (toe, heel) in each step. You can see clearly see you must tap with e.g. a toe. This is very valuable for a beginner. I have ensured most of my steps looking carefully of Gingers steps. They are clearly represented and are informative. Also you will have a good glossary of each step presented in the end of each tape.
4. At beginnings of each section Ginger taps nicely. If you look and listen carefully these short performance examples are useful.
5. Bad things: Maybe because of recording techniques a counting (a female voice) is usually inaccurate. Yourself must consider when the counting is relevant and when not. If you are taking lessons this is not a problem. Also there are steps which are presented in an easy way i.e. in a format which are not classical but instead (perhaps in purpose) presented in a most easy way or even just in a practice. This applies especially in Wings -steps (which are not for beginners but for an advanced level).
6. I gave just two STARS because there are benefits which ensures that you perform right steps but you cannot regard these as superior examples. Maybe this was done in purpose.
All right - Ginger is just a nice tapper and sure a beautiful lady.",1067644800,11,1673,4.488524590163935
1921347,5,B0000D8UB2,"In these three tapes, tap artist Ginger de Paris adheres to the concept ""Practice makes perfect.""  Each of the three tapes, contains 15 steps.  In most cases, little rewinding is necessary.  Written descriptions of all steps and sequences and a tap dictionary defining common terms appear at the end of each tape.  The footwork close-ups are packed with the visual and rhythmic information that can be more difficult to pick up during a dance class.  This is an excellent, reasonably priced introduction to tap.  Recommended for public libraries and dance collections.",971827200,17,568,5.186813186813187
1921348,5,B0000D8UB2,"I am very impressed with these DVDs and the step by steps. I was hesitant in the beginning because I saw in some reviews the caution that she was too quick for beginners but it wasn't too quick for me. Maybe reading the reviews prepared me for the worst just to recognize the best. I feel that with any new exercise tapes, there are bound to be areas we have to practice more than once to really get it down. With these DVDs, we can rewind it as much as we want if in fact we need to. I got this along with the ""I hate Exercise but love to tap"" and I think it's a great combination to have. I look forward to learning all these dvds to perfection. Also, her tap style is awesome, reminds me also of the old-style great tap dancers of which are the best. This was exactly what I was looking for. Also, the shipment arrived quickly!",1203724800,3,830,4.098159509202454
1921349,1,B0000D8UB2,"It's at best a tap dictionary. The instructor is like a machine - counting, showing and repeating the moves in exactly the same format in all chapters, without identifying challenging parts that needs more explanation. She simply doesn't tell you what to pay attention or what to take special care, which is essential for learners trying to imitate the moves.

Production quality wise, sound quality is bad, which makes it even harder to understand the instructor with an accent. The music is boring.",1195257600,2,500,5.024096385542169
1921350,3,B0000D8UB2,"It's an excellent ""how to video source"", despite of the fact that the music used in the step series usually don't match the step itself.",1186185600,3,136,4.48
1921351,2,B0000D8UB2,"I found this DVD difficult to follow and quickly got left behind in the Beginners segment, even though I have been doing classes for about 6 months.  The presenter does not explain what the step involves, she just does them and expects you to be able to copy her.  I also think she goes too fast too soon.",1185062400,,305,4.241379310344827
1921352,4,B0000D8UB2,"In general I like this DVD.  Being shot from the back and repeating the steps multiple times in different speeds is great for learning.  However, as some others have said, this tape is probably best for someone who is already taking lessons elsewhere or otherwise knows 'the basics'.

The two things I think are missing from this set are technique and style.  While Ginger tells you which steps to do and whether to use your heel or toe on a certain step, she doesn't talk about when to shift your weight or other points of more refined technique.  Also I think her performance lacks energy and style- her demonstrations are pretty straight and a little stiff.

Additionally, sometimes her counting is inconsistent, and so the timing might speed up or slow down when she is introducing a new move.

Having said all that, I must say that I am in fact a beginner and am still having a blast learning to tap with this DVD.  I think it will be a reference tape I will use for a long time, and even with its flaws is a decent value- especially if you buy it used. :)",1164672000,10,1061,4.377551020408164
1921353,5,B0000D8UB2,"I think it's great.  She mixes bits of choreography in with learning the basic steps to add some variety.  She goes slowly (especially at the beginning) and has enough repetition to learn the step,then she offers variations along with setting the step to music.",1152921600,6,261,4.909090909090909
1921354,5,B0000D8UB2,"I took tap lessons from the second grade through my sophomore year of high school, and I am now a 42-year-old homemaker.  When I decided to get back into tap, I struggled with choosing a dvd which would not be too easy and would not be beyond my ability.  I put Ginger's dvd in for the first time today and started with the intermediate level.  It was great fun.  Since I am rusty, I found the intermediate level a little challenging but still very do-able.  While Ginger does repeat each step or combination several times, she moves it along and does not put me to sleep.  I believe I will be able to master the intermediate level after two to four more viewings.  I hope then to use the intermediate level as a warm-up (since it certainly will not bore me and will be great practice for clarity of sound), and I hope improve my skills with the advanced level.  Contrary to what some of the other reviews say, Ginger does not have a ""funny"" accent; she has a lovely French accent.  She is a skilled tap dancer/hoofer, and she is very pleasant to watch.",1146441600,23,1053,4.358974358974359
1921355,5,B0000D8UB2,"Easy for me to learn from, because each step is filmed from behind and I don't have to transform the steps in my head.",1135728000,20,118,3.9583333333333335
1921356,5,B0000D8UB2,"Back in the 1950's when I was a youngster, I admired the way in which tap dancers made their steps seem effortless. My dream was to take tap dancing lessons, with real dancing  shoes. However, since my parents were unable to afford lessons nor to buy tap shoes, I tried to copy the steps that I had seen on T.V.. However, leather-soled shoes on a wooden floor do not  produce an authentic sound.

  A few weeks ago, while shopping for shoes in a popular chain store, I saw a sign that stated that if you buy one pair you get  50% off the price of a second pair of shoes. Since I had already selected the first pair, I wanted to find a second pair. Much to my amazement, they had a section of tap dance shoes! Most were in children's sizes. Then I spotted a pair in MY size. When I tried them on they felt comfortable, to boot (pardon the pun)! I ended up paying $7.50 (my shoe size) for them. When I got home I ordered the DVD noted above. Now, with the DVD's Ginger as my instructor, and my rewal dancing shoes, I have finally realized my dream!",1127433600,22,1046,4.153465346534653

I have taken 2 years of tap dance before buying the DVD.  I thought I could start with the intermediate but found the beginning level challenging enough.  After a month of dancing with Ginger I have started the intermediate level.",1126051200,25,405,4.276315789473684

8000074,4,B0000D8UB2,"This is a good DVD for beginners who have had a little instruction already. There is a lot of slow repetition but not much dialogue about how to produce the best sound and it is difficult to hear her taps in the beginner's section. I thought the music could have been mixed up more as it is a slower jazzy big band sound throughout. Overall, The value (beginner through advanced) is there and she puts steps together in practice reviews. The camera shots are close ups from the back so it is easy to see what she is doing and then the reviews are full body from the back. I like the advanced part the best even though my skill level is lower as it was challenging but manageable.",1333324800,,679,4.271317829457364
