449702,5,6302287715,"The brainchild of Terry Nation, Blakes 7 remains one of Britain's most popular Sci-Fi series. U.S audiences may be familiar with Doctor Who, which is brilliant, but the grim universe Nation conceived for Blakes 7 is a far more gritty adult affair.

A motley collection of individuals ply their way through the galaxy trying to overthrow the oppressive totalitarian regime of the Terran Federation. Roj Blake is a political agitator falsely accused of sex crimes and sent to Cygnus Alpha a remote penal colony. He escapes in a futuristic ship and is joined by Kerr Avon, a computer genius, Jenna Stanis, a smuggler and pilot, Vila Restal, a thief and self-confessed coward, Olag Gan a usually gentle giant and later Calley, a native of Auron who is capable of reading thoughts and feelings.

The ship, the Liberator, the fastest and most powerful in the galaxy affords the crew protection from the ruthless Federation. They are hounded by the power hungry Supreme Commander Servalan and her crony, Space Commander Travis, who will stop at nothing to avenge the wounds he received from Blake.

What makes the series so great is the fantastic dialogue and exceptional acting. The concept for the show is well done and makes up for the primitive BBC 1970's special effects. The crew not only fight the Federation, but also have to overcome inter-personal conflicts, especially between Blake and Avon. Blake may be a conscientious character with an axe to grind against the Federation, but Avon provides the pragmatic and less emtional counter-part.

Avon remains my all time favorite anti-hero. He's the Dirty Harry of the Sci-Fi world. Dark, brooding an intelligent(Avon means ""dark waters""), Avon's quips throughout the series are a highlight of the character conflicts. ""I look upon self interest as my great strength."" ""I've never understood why it should be necessary to become irrational in order to prove that your care, or indeed why it should be necessary to prove it at all.""

I recently bought the series from Amazon and can't wait for it to arrive. I grew up watching it in the late 70's in New Zealand where it quickly became a cult fav'. I got reacquainted with the series as a teen in the late 80's and on payTV in the 90's once again. I have to say this is my all time favourite sci-fi show and as you can tell I've memorized screeds of dialogue and other nerdy facts about it. My dream is still to pen some fan-fiction, ideas I've been kicking around for years are slowly coming to fruition.... If you can cope with the special effects, this will not disappoint if you enjoy sci-fi.",1264723200,7,2595,4.809417040358745
449703,5,6302287715,"This is top notch Sci-Fi made by the creator of the Daleks: Terry Nation. You may order it from Amazon UK but need a PAL dvd player. The story line is that of a band of rebels fighting an evil and corrupt Earth based Federation. Sort of like the one in Star Trek's mirror universe. The stories are hard hitting and no holds barred. However the show relies on great plots, and good acting instead of violence and special effects. I strongly recommend it.",1178928000,7,453,4.404761904761905
449704,5,6302287715,"If only it was available in the US on DVD!!! Sadly, it is not, forcing me to acquire the PAL version and play it on my computer. However, it is SO worth it. Here's why:

1. Great writing. The beginning story arc ('The Way Back' to 'Cygnus Alpha' is great. 'Mission to Destiny', 'Duel' and 'Seek-Locate-Destroy' are great as well.)

2. Paul Darrow - He rocks as Avon and the best written character of the series.

3. The Liberator - Ah, what a ship!

4. Terry Nation - Creator of the Daleks, he created and set the tone for what would follow. This is not kid's stuff.

5. Steven Grief as Travis. The best is still the original. Watch his brief monologue at the end of 'Seek-Locate-Destroy' and then watch what Brian Croucher does, well, anytime in Series B. Case closed.

Blake's 7 is a study in how to write, direct on a limited budget, and get quality acting. I cannot see how, if you like SciFi, you CANNOT afford to miss this series. It is one of the pinnacles of British TV along with:

-Doctor Who

-The Day of the Triffids

-Survivors

449706,5,6302287715,"Blake 7 is a wonderful BBC t.v. production.  Many Doctor Who fans should note that Terry Nation was head writer for many of the epsiodes.  Anyway on to the first installment of Blake 7 entitled ""The Way Back"".  We are given the setting of earth in the distant future where most of the human population live inside of domes due to the severe radiation outside of the domes.  The domes are run by the federation a world goverment whose hand has reached to the stars themselves and has much influence.  We are intoduced to a man called Roj Blake who from watching the first few minutes is a rather normal person.  However when he meets a few of his freinds his life takes on a new twist.  He finds that the earth has never had radation and that the human population insdie of the dome is a lie.  He then finds out that he was once the leader of a rebel band bent on stopping the true agenda of the Fedeartion total domiantion of the universe.  Soon freinds turn into false memories his future uncertain his life is without meaning and then the Federation find him with the new rebels.  He is soon brought on false charges and a mockery of a trail sends Blake to the penal planet to live out the rest of his life.  This is the first installment of the Blake 7 story.  Although this is by no means the first epsiode.  In the next epsiodes to come Blake has his fighters and a reason to stop the Federation.
In the Epsiode entilted ""Space Fall"" Blake is being shipped to the penal planet Cygnus Alpha.  Along with Blake he meets Avon the egocentric computer genuis, Jan the tough as nails female piolt, Villa the cowardly safe cracker and Gan the brutal yet computer controled chipped prisoner.  Blake trying to find a way to take over the ship and start his plans of stopping the Federation.  The captain of the prisoner ship finds a large ship dirfiting unkonwing it would be the doom of most aboard.  He sends men over to try and take over the ship.  They end up mad or dead.  The captain sends Blake over along with Jan and Avon.  Soon Blake is confronted by the ships computer called Zen who tries and kill those with false images.  Blake overcomes and takes over the newly dubbed ship the Liberator.  Now with a ship and gathering a crew is easy.  But the captain has written off Blake and the others dead and heads on to the penal planet to drop off the remaining prionsers.

449707,4,6302287715,"""The Way Back"" and ""Space Fall"" are the first two episodes of the classic British sci-fi series ""Blake's 7."" B7 is a sort of ""anti-Star Trek."" Like ST, it takes place in a future where humans have interplanetary space travel and have established a federation of worlds. But in B7, the Federation is an oppressive, totalitarian regime that keeps its citizens docile with drugs, and ruthlessly crushes those who stand for freedom. The heroes of B7 are rebels who oppose the Federation.
""The Way Back"" effectively establishes the dark, grimy tone of the series, as hero Blake is falsely charged with a crime by the Federation justice system. But this episode is mostly set-up, with Blake seeming almost like a secondary character. The second episode, ""Space Fall,"" is better. This exciting story involves a revolt on a Federation transport that is bringing prisoners to a penal colony. The character dynamics that distinguish the series really begin to emerge in ""Space Fall."" And the drama involving the crew of the transport ship is an effective counterpart to the interactions of Blake and his cohorts.
Yes, the special effects fairly primitive, but the acting, dialogue, and daring vision of series creator Terry Nation make this video special. These episodes are good science fiction on their own, and are the foundation for even better episodes to come.",991872000,15,1356,5.058035714285714
449708,3,6302287715,"This tape comprises the first two episodes of the brilliant British series. Loosely based as science fiction due to its setting in the future, this is primarily a drama series based in fact, dealing with human rights  abuses that unhappily occur in our present. In an unspecified time  (although not too far in the future), Earth is run by a totalitarian  Federation - dissidents are murdered or sent to penal colonies and the  populace is drugged into a state of subservient apathy. Into this scenario  enters Roj Blake, a seemingly unassuming man. Blake is asked by a friend to  join a meeting of rebels; this he does, with fateful consequences. The  first episode, ""The Way Back"" is the best to authentically  capture the Orwellian atmosphere the series is based on. The sterile, white  corridors of the domed city; the ruthless and murderous black suited  security patrols; the psycho-manipulators - they all depict perfectly this  depressing possibility of the future. Blake's nightmarish journey as he  rediscovers his repressed past is harrowing - his mental breakdown,  complete with horrific and violent flashbacks, is a disturbing indicator of  what this regime is capable of. The second episode, ""Space Fall"",  deals with the formation of the group that will become Blake's crew. Of  particular interest is the introduction of Kerr Avon, the cynical would-be  computer fraudster, who will become the series' most interesting character.  One of the down sides to ""Blake's 7"" is that the introduction is  very slow - it continues over the next two episodes. A casual viewer may be  put off by this, despite the importance of understanding the background and  motivation of the characters in the later stories. In short, essential for  the sake of continuity, but very heavygoing. But perserverance will reward  the new viewer.",962064000,5,1835,5.125
449709,5,6302287715,"Blake's 7 came out in the late 70's and early 80's.  It stands as a shining example of classic science fiction.  Too many science fiction movies and series attempt to use special effects to carry the series.  Blake's 7 used intelligent plots and extremely well written characters.  This video is the first in the series.  And you do need to watch them in  order to know what's going on.  This series is also one of the most  realistic I've seen.  The good guys sometimes lose (and lose horribly!),  and the bad guys sometimes win.  Main characters are killed, new ones are  reruited.  It is fluid.",923356800,3,597,4.571428571428571

However, I have to say that I cannot recommend buying the subsequent seasons of Blakes 7: the scriptwriting quality began to go downhill in the last two episodes of Season Two and only got worse in the next years.

449756,4,6302287715,"Yes, I'm reviewing a videotape, because this UK show is not available on Region 1 DVDs.
Yes, I'm only giving it 4 stars.  The series as a whole is great, but in comparison to later episodes, these aren't quite as good.

The Series: Blake's 7 is one of the best SciFi TV series that most Americans have never heard about, yet nearly all British have.  (Unfortunately, it hasn't gotten a revival yet like that OTHER Terry Nation UK SciFi series.)  SciFi TV shows and movies typically aren't that great in the science department, but who cares?  Give me an entertaining story with great dialogue and acting, and I'm happy.  Blake's 7 has these in abundance.  True, it doesn't have top-notch special effects, not even for its day, but again, so what?

Blake's 7 is Star Trek turned upside-down, or at least sideways (check out the symbol).  Many centuries in the future, humans have spread throughout the galaxy, bound together by the oppressive Federation.  There still remain a few independent planets, which the Federation is constantly trying to take over.  The Federation's military is headed by Supreme Commander Servelan, who frequently sends out Space Commander Travis to do her dirty work.

This Volume: Typically, each episode of Blake's 7 is a complete story in itself.  There are a few arcs in the series, for example the first three episodes (of which this tape has the first two) which introduces the most of the ""7"" and gets them on their ship, the Liberator.
Episode 1: The Way Back - Roj Blake was a political dissident.  Rather than killing him (and possibly creating a martyr), the Federation erased his rebellion from his memory and put him on Earth, where the people live in drug-induced passivity.  A few years later, a dissident group tricks Blake into attending a meeting, where they tell him who he used to be.  The Federation breaks into the meeting, where they capture Blake and kill everyone else.
Blake awakes in jail, where he is told he is being accused of child molesting, a completely fabricated charge.  While in prison, he tries to get his defense attorney to show the charge is false, and to find evidence for the massacre at the meeting.  The attorney eventually learns the truth, but is too late to help Blake, who is sent on a prison ship to the penal colony of Cygnus Alpha.  We meet some of his fellow prisoners:
Jenna Stannis - spaceship pilot and smuggler - until she got caught.  There are some things even she won't smuggle, though.
Vila Restal - a kleptomaniac - ""there's no lock I can't pick if I'm not frightened enough,"" serves as the comic relief for the series.

Episode 2: Space Fall - As the prison ship makes its way to Cygnus Alpha, the prisoners (led by Blake) try to take over the ship.  They fail.  We meet additional prisoners -
Kerr Avon - engineer and computer genius - sentenced for attempting to extract millions from the Federation banking system.
Gan - sentenced for murdering Federation guards who ""attacked"" Gan's wife.  He now has a ""limiter chip"" in his brain that prevents him from killing again.
The ship happens upon a space battle between unknown combatants.  One of the battling ships is left abandoned.  The crew of the prison ship decide to salvage it, and send some of their people over, who are either killed or driven insane.  The crew still wants the ship, so they try sending over Blake, Jenna and Avon.  The mystery ship is defending itself with a device that afflicts people's minds, and Blake's previous brainwashing helps him to overcome the effect and destroy the device.  They take over the mystery ship (which Blake will later name the Liberator) and head to Cygnus Alpha to rescue the other prisoners to crew their new ship.  Blake intends to use the ship to fight the Federation.
Avon gets most of the best lines in this episode (as often happens).
So, we've met 5 of the 7 (Blake, Avon, Vila, Jenna, and Gan).  Who are the other two?  Well, be patient.

People who suffer from ADHD will likely find these episodes (and the series in general) as too slow-moving.  The color quality of my tape isn't that great, though this could be due to age.  The tape has no extras.  The two main antagonists of the first two seasons - Servelan and Travis - are not in these episodes.",1377302400,,4256,4.6657718120805365

449759,3,6302287715,"Heard about this show from other people much after the series finished, so my curiosity was piqued.  I never saw the original airing, and I don't remember this show being advertised on any network, so it must of had a small following in the US.  Be that as it may, it is enjoyable.  The show is typical BBC, good storyline to make up for a smaller budget.  Many of the special effects are cheesy and dated, but that is to be expected from these kind of shows. The characters and their interaction are more realistic; bickering, clash of egos, questionable morality. This show was created for a more mature audience, and that's a good thing after years of 60's cow eyed optimism.  Avon character is particularly intriguing, always wondering when he'll switch over to the stronger side.

449760,5,6302287715,"As an American Blakes 7 fan I've had to go through a trial-and-error process regarding the Blakes 7 Region 2 DVD sets. Here are some things to watch out for. Most (possibly all) DVD-Rom drives will allow you to switch the region setting up to five times. By changing the DVD Region setting to United Kingdom, I was able to watch these Region 2 DVDs on my computer.*

You also have the option of buying a region free DVD player, which you can get for less than $100. For HDMI compatibility, there are the multi region blu-ray players which are more expensive.

Be sure to ask the seller if you'll be getting a 4-disk or 5-disk set. The Amazon photo isn't necessarily what the seller will send you. The 5-disk sets are much better and include commentaries and special features. You'll know you have the 5-disk set when it's packaged in a cardboard casing with just the Blakes 7 logo on the front cover.

The 4-disk ""international"" sets are designed for non-English speaking countries. They don't include any commentaries or special features - just the episodes with optional subtitles in a foreign language and a cheaply redesigned main menu to incorporate that language. These sets are in plastic casings and have the logo plus three production photos on the front cover. Be wary of sellers who mention foreign subtitles, because the subtitles on the 5-disk sets are only in English.

Blakes 7 has been called the anti-Star Trek. It's a smartly written, grim science fiction show with ambiguous morals and sarcastic dialogue set in a bleak dystopian future. The look and special effects are reminiscent of 1970s Doctor Who, but the writing puts it more in league with shows like The Prisoner.

Every episode in the first series was written by it's creator, Terry Nation (famed for having created the Daleks for Doctor Who). Following the first series, episodes were written by various authors. Script editor Chris Boucher wrote many of them, with occasional episodes written by Robert Holmes just after his amazing stint as script editor for Doctor Who.

By the end of the second series enough actors had left the show to make for an uneven series three. When Blakes 7 was unexpectedly renewed for a fourth series, several changes resulted in a run of very dark episodes, culminating in a terrific grand finale.

Kudos to the team that designed the DVD sets. The animated menus convey a great respect for the show. The special features are abundant with both old and recent interviews with the actors, particularly the series four set, which includes a lengthy interview with actor Paul Darrow who played Avon throughout the show's run.

449761,4,6302287715,"I remembered Blakes 7 from the 1980's, watching this great new British SF show with characters that had issues with each other, that weren't always in agreement, and that didn't blindly follow the leader. I remember watching them on video tapes that had been copied from a British TV screen onto an NTSC video camera and then mailed to America where a growing group of fans could enjoy the blue washed-out video. Plus I was probably watching a 3rd generation tape.

So I didn't always pick up what was going on in the scene, and I don't think I saw all the episodes. But I do remember a fascinating show that I always wanted to watch 'for real'. When I saw that Blakes 7 was available on DVD I eagerly awaited the region 1 version, but it didn't come out. Once I had a region 2 player I ordered the 1st season.

I was not disappointed. While the visual special effects are typical BBC SF effects of the time, (the old VCR video might actually be better, all things considered) the writing and the characters hold up over time. Possibly over the intervening 30 years I have become a bit jaded, or my expectations are higher, but the female characters seem a bit weaker than I remember. At least in the first season, Servalan is not quite as vicious as I remember. Maybe she improves in the following seasons.

I look forward to the 2nd season.",1297814400,,1342,4.4471544715447155

Blake and his men commandeer a derrelict alien spacecraft which they then plan to use to fight against the Federation in hopes of eventually bringing about its downfall.
