8062558,5,B0009KA7T0,"This is one of the best band compilation videos I've seen.  It has a great documentary of the band rising to their fame.  It has the full Cornerstone 2003 concert in great quality which is amazing.  It has all their music videos so far, even About a Burning Fire which was awesome.  It has tons of live concerts as well.  Overall 5 out of 5 stars and a must have for any blindside fan.  I sold mine but think I will buy it again.",1270252800,,429,4.0476190476190474
8062559,4,B0009KA7T0,I love blindside so I'm a little biased but if you love blindside this dvd is definately worth getting,1160697600,,102,4.421052631578948
8062560,4,B0009KA7T0,"This DVD chronicles the first 10 year's of the band with videos, a full show from Cornerstone 2003, a video history and numerous other tid bits. The video history of the band is tastefully done and shows how th band has progressed and notes achievements the band has come across, going from album to album and the tours in between. Don't get me wrong, it's not funny, but it's not as long as the drawn out Thrice documentary that was 2 hours long, this is under 45 minutes. You have every video the band has done up to this point including ""King of the Closet"" which features the guy from the Drowning Pool video (bit of trivia for you) as ""About A burning fire"" ""All of Us"", ""Sleepwalking"" and more. The cornerstone concert is wild, including most of the other live footage throught the dvd(the guitarist does a one handed cartwheel with his guitar!) This dvd wasn't packed full of a lot, but it's a lot more than what other bands have given us.",1128211200,,946,4.442528735632184
8062561,5,B0009KA7T0,"When I found out this dvd was coming out I could not wait to buy it!  Now that I saw it, it is well worth what I paid for it.  Blindside ROCKS!!!!!!",1126915200,,148,3.59375
8062562,5,B0009KA7T0,"Okay... Let me point out what has been overtly criticized: The concert audio is not the best, true... However, this DVD is not about the concert audio. It's about what Blindside is, who they are and what they produce to people around them.

Inside you will find a wonderful documentary opening the band up so that we can take a peek deep into who they are. How they began as a four friends just wanting to make some music and turned into the artistic powerhouse that they are now. The documentary covers from their first album and ends with them working on their latest release (and incredible album): ""The Great Depression.""

As for the concerts, no, they don't have great audio... true, and yet, you can still tell that they play flawless live shows, musically speaking. Now, the energy that is Blindside is undeniable. If you can't feel it watching them play, you can see it in the faces of those that are there. Now, of course, you should go see them live if you have the opportunity (especially now, with their latest release), as you should any great band, but as far as the concerts go: Blindside fan or not, you'll enjoy the fact that they're such energetic and talented musicians.

The videos are great, if you haven't catched them in any of the local or national music networks, you should buy this just for the videos... and think of the Documentary and the Concerts as extras.

Overall, it is a buy that you'll not regret if you are a fan of talent and good musical presence. And if you're a Blindside fan and don't have it... what are you waiting for?",1123459200,10,1564,4.5159010600706715
8062563,2,B0009KA7T0,"Blindside....amazing genre creating band....amazing live show...

DONT let this DVD determind that for you...because it wont.

The Audio on the DVD is HORRIBLE....1st the DVD menu is really loud....but apparently not loud enough....go to the ""Videos"" Section and you'll be deaf if your volume is loud...(have your remote with the mute button ready) as far as video...i wouldnt say it captures their best live performances ....if you have a chance to see them in PERSON  DEFF. DO IT!... the dvd has 2 full live shows...the older show at ""cornerstone"" has (from 1-10) about an 7.5 on the audio sound...the video is nice...but the ""internal storm tour"" the video is sweet but the audio id put at a whopping! 3.5! ironically i look in the credits of the dvd to see who is responsible for the audio monstrosity (being im an audio engineer..i just had to find out) ...and there is no name for the ""internal storm tour"" ...if i did the audio for that i wouldnt want to claim it either..haha. the videos are nice...the extras are cool...if your a blind side fan..i GUESS it would still be a cool buy being they have nothing other than this on DVD format...but i was just disapointed with the Live shows audio..",1123459200,,1202,4.714285714285714

8062565,4,B0009KA7T0,"I just bought this dvd a few days ago, and i've yet to finish watching it.  with tons of concert footage, videos for 'king of the closet', 'pitiful', 'all of us', etc, photo slideshows, and a documentary showing blindside's 10 year journey, it is a great buy. i only question how many times i need to see blindside perform the same song. the concert energy is perfectly captured. it's pretty sweet.",1120003200,2,398,4.605633802816901
