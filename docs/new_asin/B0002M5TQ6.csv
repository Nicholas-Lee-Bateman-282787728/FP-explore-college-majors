Hee Haw ranked in the Top 20 Nationwide in 1971. No One has Pay me to say any of this and I don't know anyone from this Company. I'm just a Big Fan of Hee Haw and Country Music. I love the Old Style Country Music with the Original Instruments, nothing like today's, most artists don't even use the Steel Guitar any more which by the way it goes back to 1922 and earlier.

2103670,5,B0002M5TQ6,"After 43 years people still love ""Hee Haw"", and why not...it was/is a truly great and fun loving all-American show.
""Hee Haw Laffs: Special Edition"" was nicely put together. They combined the 1996 ""Hee Haw Laffs"" with more, somewhat recent interviews with some of the cast including: Roy Clark, Charlie McCoy, Roni Stoneman, Lulu Roman, Jim & Jon Hager, George Lindsey and writer George Yanok. The interview segments are great though I would have preferred they spent more time with The Hagers. What is interesting is that as time goes by these interviews will become more important, already we have lost George Lindsey and The Hagers so this DVD is all the more special.  All in all a nice collection of inside information and comedy high-lights from 1969.

What needs to be remembered is that when ""Hee Haw Laffs"" first came out in '96, it was the first time any ""Hee Haw"" footage had been released and they limited the footage to a half hour of clips. Since then many DVD's of entire episodes have been released. Also, if anyone wants more interviews with the cast, then I highly reccommend that they purchase the DVD series, ""Country's Family Reunion: A Salute to the Kornfield"". It was taped in 2011 and features four hours of footage with over twenty cast members. Check out cfrvideos.com for more info. In the meantime, pick up a copy of this DVD for your collection, you'll be glad you did. Long live ""Hee Haw""!",1341100800,2,1419,4.717741935483871
2103671,5,B0002M5TQ6,I purchased this to study the material and see the costumes for a skit. It brought back fond memories. Fast shipping by a good seller.,1264809600,,134,4.4
2103672,5,B0002M5TQ6,It is great to see Hee Haw again. The whole DVD supplies a hour of laughs for the whole family. Good clean fun.,1255824000,,111,3.869565217391304
2103673,5,B0002M5TQ6,It is funny throughout if you are familiar with HeeHaw at all.  If not some of the jokes you will not find so funny because you will not know the personalities of the show.,1255305600,,172,4.0588235294117645
2103674,3,B0002M5TQ6,"On the plus side, it's a complete episode, but $13 for one episode is very steep.  The audio and video quality seems great to me, but I'm not ultra-picky.

  The ""Extras"" are basically throwaways, consisting of links to the cornfield gags (that are already in the episode anyway) and a text list of guest stars (for that year?)  That's IT.

  I'm happy to see this great show again but I probably won't be buying many more Hee Haw DVDs at that price.",1142380800,15,450,4.402439024390244
2103675,3,B0002M5TQ6,"in response to Yarby Yarby, this DVD, as well as the other 6 in the complete set showed no clor bleeding at all. Just the opposite.  Colors were correct in hue and the contrast was excellent. The sound was ok, nothing to write home about but better than it originally sounded on the TV sets back then. My complaint is about the value of the whole set that I purchased from Time Life.  Seven DVDs averaging only about 100 minutes, including some repeated material, is a rip-off for $120.00.  The series is good enough that it should be offered in complete year sets.  I'd buy every one.  There is, however, a good sampling of the humor including my favorites, Junior Sample and the jug song about gloom, despair and misery on me. What is offered here on Amazon is the same that stores like Target carry but I encourage everyone to write to Time Life and beg for better offerings. They can do it if they want to",1108080000,30,909,4.386904761904762
2103676,2,B0002M5TQ6,"It's wonderful to have the opportunity to acquire this show on DVD. The jokes are still as corny as ever, the music still as good as ever, and Junior's delivery still cracks me up.

The sad thing is, Time-Life is the company putting out the DVD's. These DVDs are a poor value. One show is all that is provided.

Also, Time-Life has obviously not seen fit to restore any of the footage. Colors bleed badly (which is extremely obvious on a show with loud sets, lighting, and clothing), and grain is everywhere.

Should you buy this DVD, or the subsequent releases? Well, I doubt this show will ever be released as it should have been....in full season sets. So if you want to have copies of this classic, this is probably your only choice. Just prepare yourself to have deep pockets and low expectations.",1093996800,54,802,4.555555555555555
