6184569,1,B00HMQBEW8,"two covers exist for this movie, the one with the bound woman led me to believe a saw or Hostel type movie, which I purchased with that expectation. WOW, was I wrong. Just a mess of a movie that actually seemed to put forth some effort and time. unfortunately, stupid plot, or lack thereof, a g rated sex scene and nothing to redeem this waste of my time and money. this almost rivals seeds revenge, but at least it was an attempt at a rip off, this one was just aimless. bad acting, average looking leads, just childish storyline. As I said WOW, avoid, avoid, avoid,",1425600000,23,567,4.3584905660377355

6184572,2,B00HMQBEW8,"Julie Mond owns this wanna-be giallo, but her enticing turn as an over-sexed smart-ass can't save this effort, which, despite a strong beginning, rife with solid acting, clever dialogue and titular animated inserts, clearly starts falling apart near the end of the second act. Improbabilities & plot holes abound. Granted, these ""huh?!"" qualities are staples of classic Italian giallos, but for them to work, to be effective, there has to be a strong suspension of disbelief created by the film's momentum and atmosphere. Here, thanks to the director evidently losing control of his vision, all that's ultimately apparent is the ""Huh??!!"".",1454284800,,639,5.336633663366337

6184578,3,B00HMQBEW8,"The plot is okay, but the movie overall could've been shot better, and the acting was sub-par. The editing was sloppy, as changes in each scene revealed inconsistency in the way the movie was shot, and caused a choppy dialogue within some scenes. The characters were inconsistent, with the exception of the female lead. The others did not maintain character, I wasn't really sold on the acting.

The story and plot is original, just could've been told a little better. For a modern day horror movie, I appreciated that the writers and director stuck more to the development of the story and characters rather than blood, gore, and nudity. Although the background of the lead male could've been slightly more developed, it was still a decent story, and what earned it stars from me instead of one or two.",1448323200,2,803,4.776978417266187

8633588,1,B00HMQBEW8,Terrible movie. Ridiculous nonsensical plot. Filled with unlikeable characters doing illogical things and responding to crisis in ways no real human being would. Just an awful piece of trash.,1470873600,,191,5.620689655172414

8633591,3,B00HMQBEW8,"This film tells the story of two marines who have just returned stateside. No sooner have they arrived than they find themselves involved in a dangerous plot. A mysterious killer stalks them and their friends, forcing them to play a literal (and deadly) game of hangman.

The premise, for how original and twisted it is, is carried out rather well. The plot however is a bit convoluted, and some elements felt tacked-on. The plot unfortunately does not develop the characters all too deeply, and so when one of them dies, there isn't much in terms of emotional reaction.

All told, it's an interesting film that's a little rough, but still pretty good.",1463961600,,652,4.8125
8633592,1,B00HMQBEW8,Badly acted and amateur shot. Prime really needs to step up the quality of their films. I didn't even notice much of a plot to this one. Just 5 annoying people fighting in the woods. Don't bother with this one unless you can't sleep and are out of sleeping pills.,1463270400,,263,4.28
