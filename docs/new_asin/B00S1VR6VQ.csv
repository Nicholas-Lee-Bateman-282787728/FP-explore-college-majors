6947715,5,B00S1VR6VQ,"First of all the quality of the films are quite good with One-Eyed Jacks being a little less great, but still watchable. The quality of both The Freshman and The Chase are great and I'm glad I finally have these films. As to The Wild One, the quality is good and I would recommend the Blu-ray released by Mill Creek also. Only The Wild One and One-Eyed Jacks are in fullscreen format. There are no bonus features or any other audio except for English, plus there's no subtitles. Overall, I would recommend this for the two Sony DVDs that are OOP.",1426723200,17,546,4.415841584158416

6947753,4,B00S1VR6VQ,After watching Listen To Me Marlon on Showtime I went on a Brando binge. These early films are really fascinating. Brando was so compelling and cool. The stories are ahead of their time in social impact. Brando had more courage than most and was so confident as an actor that he did not compromise his values for Hollywood.,1464480000,,323,4.586206896551724

6947755,5,B00S1VR6VQ,"There was only one Brando and this includes one of his most provocative films ""The Wild One"" Also, includes ""One-Eyed Jacks"", a dark western that I believe was the only film he produced and directed. ""The Chase"" pairs him with Jane Fonda and ""The Freshman"" is forgettable.",1459468800,,272,4.808510638297872
6947756,5,B00S1VR6VQ,"No, this DVD collection doesn't have ""The Godfather"" or ""On the Waterfront"", but it's a good collection for people who want to watch more of his movies that aren't necessarily his most well-known.

""The Wild One"" is a classic, and the first of it's kind, so I highly recommend watching it in general, even if you don't necessarily get this DVD collection.

When I ordered this DVD set, it came quickly and exactly the way I wanted it. If you love Brando (like me), get it!",1453852800,2,472,4.476744186046512

8696910,4,B00S1VR6VQ,"This two disc set is a nice little sampling of the film work of Marlon Brando.  Of the four films, it included a Brando classic from the 1950s, The Wild One, an almost forgotten gem from the 1960s, The Chase, and a much less serious entry with the comedy The Freshman.  A disappointment comes the presentation of the Brando directed (he replaced none other than Stanley Kubrick) One-Eyed Jacks, which, despite being filmed in Paramounts VistaVision process, is, surprisingly, presented here in a pan-and-scan version. Many count One-Eyed Jacks among the great westerns.  Despite this one shortfall, I still highly recommend this Mill Creek release which is available at a very affordable price.  This would have been a five star rating if ""One-Eyed Jacks"" had been properly letterboxed.",1498089600,,786,5.1171875
