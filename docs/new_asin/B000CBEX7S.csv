8096634,3,B000CBEX7S,"In this 50's TV comedy series, the private secretary to talent agent Peter Sands (Don Porter), Susan Camille MacNamara (Ann Sothern) goes out of her way to help her boss in the most convoluted schemes. Some how she always puts her foot in it; yet in the end everything turns out fine.

Either a victim of old age or bad memory (possible the world has changed); I found this series to be straining for laughs.

The DVD volume one contains:
""Cat in a Hot Tin File""
""Dollars and Sense""
""Old Dogs, New Tricks""
""That's no Lady, That's an Agent""

If you enjoyed the acting of Don Porter then you should not miss him in the Bob Hope classic ""Bachelor in Paradise"" (1961)

The version I watched was distributed by alpha video and was not remastered (it really should have been). The images do not hold up well on today's big screen TV's",1523318400,,828,4.427631578947368
8096635,4,B000CBEX7S,"PRIVATE SECRETARY stars Ann Sothern as Susie MacNamara, the meddlesome secretary to New York talent mogul Peter Sands (Don Porter).  Susie often gets confused as to the limitations of her job and becomes frequently entangled in the lives of Peter and his clients.  Snappy dialogue and great comic support is provided by Ann Tyrrell as Susie's workmate Vi Praskins.  The show originally ran on the CBS network from 1954-57, and later went under the title of ""Susie"" for syndicated re-runs.

Ann Sothern is the perfect anchor for the show; her brittle, no-nonsense comedy style holds the series together, and her chemistry with Don Porter is undeniable.  Ann Tyrrell steals many scenes as daffy receptionist Vi.

This volume of episodes from Critics Choice includes:

""Oh Brother!"" - Susie's attempt to help reunite the night-watchman with his brother following a twenty-year absence backfires, when she discovers the brothers parted on bad terms.  Original airdate 4th March 1956.

""The Little Caesar of Bleeker Street"" - When Susie's heirloom diamond ring vanishes from the office, the prime suspect is smart-mouthed shoeshine boy Chuckie Willis (a very young Harry Shearer of ""Spinal Tap"" and ""Simpsons"" fame).  Original airdate 1st April 1956.

""Passing the Buck"" - When Peter's barber (guest star Frank Cady) writes a play and asks Peter to read it, the play is passed - unread - to Susie, Vi and Scotty, who all think it will be terrible.  Their opinions backfire when the play is discovered to be a hit and is bought by a rival agency!  Original airdate 29th April 1956.

""Sow's Ear"" - When Susie decides to give lessons in manners to Cagey Calhoun (Jesse White), he uses his newfound people-skills to steal away Peter's promising new client.  Original airdate 14th October 1956.
