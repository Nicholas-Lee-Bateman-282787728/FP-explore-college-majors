8706391,4,B00UGQ74RU,"This is a really good family film with a good message. John Ritter is really good in the lead role, But then Again he's good in any roll may he rest in peace. Love the concept of an actor working as promotion of the film dressing up as Captain Avenger and accidently saves people in a store robbery and become Captain Avenger! A touching and funny movie A must see!",1485302400,,365,4.228571428571429
