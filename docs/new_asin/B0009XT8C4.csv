2335210,5,B0009XT8C4,"I originally got the DVD because of the Robby Gordon factor. I was blown away by the much bigger story of the race, Baja and all the competitors, particularly motorcycle riders Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy & J.N. Roberts.

McCoy is, by far, the most compelling and touching story. The original idea man behind the film, he convinced Dana Brown & Scott Waugh that the Baja 1000 was worthy of documentation. To add to the fun, Mouse decided to drive the 1000 mile race solo, a hard enough task for a driver with four-wheels and a roll cage, nearly impossible for a motorcyclist.

Roberts was the winner of the first Baja 1000 in 1967, as a co-driver with Malcolm Smith. His drive to finish the 2003 race, just weeks after picking up his first social security check, is both irrestible and funny.

Whether you are an off-road fan, a racing fan, a Robby Gordon fan or none of the above, if you have a heart, you will enjoy this movie, these people and their stories.",1125446400,4,952,4.491329479768786
2335211,5,B0009XT8C4,"Dust to Glory is a spectacular accomplishment by Dana Brown. Stunning in it's cinematography and simple in it story this movie will touch you if you believe in the triumph and preserverance of the human spirit. Filled with well known racing hero's, and more importantly the little known guys who compete against them, Dust to Glory provides a rare and touching look into what drives people to test themselves against the edge of the envelope. THIS IS NOT JUST A MOVIE FOR THE GUYS and you do not have to be a off road racing fan to enjoy it.

Dust to Glory stands on it's own and will leave you feeling better for having met the people it spotlights. Dana Brown, I am sure your Dad is proud of you with this movie, simply because you've passed him.",1125100800,,748,4.420289855072464
2335212,5,B0009XT8C4,"This film is simply a work of art.  From beginning to end I was literally on the edge of my seat.  I couldn't get enough of it.

Race fan or not, I think this documentary has something for everyone.  The vehicles, the locations and scenery, the people, and above all the human spirit.  Mike 'Mouse' McCoy's accomplishment is as inspirational as it is amazing.

Find the biggest TV you can and turn the volume up!  You won't be disappointed.

(How about the Paris-Dakkar next?)  :)",1125014400,,480,4.552941176470588
2335213,5,B0009XT8C4,"Its was a great project, and it turned out to be the best in the business (off road coverage, that is)... I just want to say something about off road racing, CLASS 11 (VW Stock), the true die hard experience. You have to live it, to say that you've race the BAJA, inch by inch, no nonsense!!! We hope to see you soon , down here in Ensenada, Baja California, M&eacute;xico.

Team 1100 WELCOMES YOU ALL!!!",1123804800,3,404,4.315789473684211
2335214,5,B0009XT8C4,"When I took my wife to see this movie, I was excited to see what looked like an exciting movie about motorcycles racing through Baja.  She was excited about an evening together, and thought she'd suffer through the movie for the sake of the relationship.

Turns out, she enjoyed it as much as me!  This isn't just a movie about gearheads driving through the desert, it's the story of the hundreds of people and families involved in the race, how it affects them, the challenges they face, and overcoming obstacles.  You'll laugh with the racers as they joke around, hide sniffles as Malcom works with the orphans, share frustration with The Weatherman, and white-knuckle whatever's handy as the trucks and bikes race through crowds of people or along the cliffs, and get entirely caught up in the intensity of the race action across the beautifully dangerous Baja landscape.

This movie documents the triumph of the human spirit in the harshest of conditions.  Definitely worth seeing, many times.",1117497600,25,997,4.940119760479042
2335215,5,B0009XT8C4,"For those of us who've ridden Baja this is a reminder of why we do so.  For those who haven't this is just the thing to show you why you should.  High speed action, adventure, guts, and glory all wrapped up in one great movie.  Dana is rapidly approaching the skill level of his father and his movies are having just as much impact as On Any Sunday and Endless Summer.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves riding, racing and the desert!  Two thumbs up!",1114128000,9,466,4.25

2335245,5,B0009XT8C4,"This is such a great show.  It's funny, compelling and informative.  I had no idea what the premise was behind the Baja until I watched this show.  It surely peaked my interest in Luke McMillion, Johnny Campbell and Mouse McCoy.  I have found myself seeking these gents out and rooting for them (along with Andy Grider and the Indy guys) in all of their various endevours. Makes me want to book a trip to Ensenada!

This is a must-see even if you aren't a moto or race fan.  The story is great. Dana Brown did a wonderful job on this film and I am hoping that Sal Fish will allow him to shoot another! I think Class 11 could have their own film!",1471132800,,645,4.203252032520325

2335268,5,B0009XT8C4,"There is a grace and beauty to this film.  Yes, at its core its about a bunch of guys (and some women) coming together for a grand adventure.  Man and machine ripping through the unforgiving Baja landscape.  Many of these guys do this year after year and know each other.  The film does a good job showing their mutual support, humor, and esprit de corps.  While they're there to compete, they're also there for the adventure, the camaraderie--something about this race just gets in their blood and keeps them coming back.

The cinematography and musical score are beautiful complements.  The long-shot scenes of the lone motorcyclist racing down the beach by the edge of the sea are just stunning.  Plenty of jaw dropping footage of the otherworldly Baja landscape.  A place where one would expect to see lone, wandering mystics versus machines howling through the countryside.  This documentary has that kind of texture.

I cant emphasize enough the beauty of this film even though, at its core, it is about a high octane endurance race that pushes the racers to their absolute limits.  At the end, racers are asked to sum of their experience in a word.  One veteran racer describes it as mystical.  And you get that sense watching this very fine film of this remarkable race.",1455408000,,1278,4.802752293577981

2335302,5,B0009XT8C4,Excellent movie of the amazing triumph of the human spirit.  Trucks and buggies don't compare to the endurance those motorcycle riders need and to go all the way like Mouse did is just unbelievable.

My 1 star is because what the H*** Amazon??? When I bought this it was in full HD glory.....now it's SD and won't even fit my tv screen it's boxed!!! I feel ripped off because when I first saw this it was on prime free, I loved the HD and I bought it, it was HD then too now it's in this reduced format. I feel the same as if someone had come in my house stolen my blu-ray and left a cheap VHS copy that was stretched in it's place..... FIX THIS!!! Otherwise until they do, DO NOT purchase this film on Amazon in this format, it's a rip off in this format, you would do better to purchase on disk until they fix it.",1425600000,4,755,3.8774193548387097

It's beautifully shot and edited, the scenery is inspiring, and the passion of the teams isn't some scripted ""reality"" hogwash that passes for entertainment these days.

2335381,4,B0009XT8C4,"Interesting and entertaining documentary.  For me it was a little nastalgic. Kind of a continuing progression of the sport from the early days of On Any Sunday"" when riding areas were open and accessible unitl they got much more organized and serious. We all idolized riders like JN Roberts. He was so fast he would finish a Hare & Hound, load up his bike and drive away before second place even crossed the finish line.",1383868800,,420,4.6

It's one of those things I know there's hardly a chance I'll ever get to do. This film though, you get so much history, all the passion of those that do race in it. It's nearly enough motivating factor to try and find a way to compete in it in one form or another.

2335384,5,B0009XT8C4,Great photography of an amazing race (reminds me of the surfing movie Endless Summer). Besides the racing it really tells the spectrum of human stories about a person's commitment to race even if it's to best his own personal record. No sponsors for many racers and very little press coverage plus only a few interested fans yet year after year they carry on man against nature and himself.,1382486400,,390,4.75

The truth is that there were hundreds of competitors in this particular event as there are for every offroad race. There are several people in and on each of the various vehicles competing, meaning that there were over a thousand people who were actually competitors on the course in this event. Thousands of others are involved in supporting the vehicles; pit crew members, spouses, family members, friends, those who go to the event just to be involved, course workers and other officials, not to mention the tens of thousands who are there to watch, many of whom live in a different country.

Some of the best story is from Mario Andriette, people still come up to him and talk to him about his role and being the grand marshal for the baja 1000.

I've been on the filming end, not just the 1000, but the 500, and Barstow to Vegas. I don't know Dana Brown, but I remember ""On any Sunday"" being a major milestone in my life as a child.

The danger of the race makes me the think the participants are crazy, but I loved watching the motorcycles and jacked-up trucks kick up the dust.",1252108800,,331,4.689655172413793
2335475,5,B0009XT8C4,"Dust to Glory remains, for me at least, the defining motor sport/adventure film - and I have a reasonable collection from which to choose. It covers the Baja 1000 off road race from Ensenada, California to La Paz, Mexico. The prize money for which, (if any) is poultry and the dangers too numerous to mention. Yet the the entrants list reads like a who's who of top American riders and drivers, all willing to commit their skills and indeed their lives for the coveted Baja title - pretty much to the point of near reckless abandonment.

The Direction and filming are the best off road work I have ever seen, which coupled with a sound track driven by the Vast's 'Falling from the sky' and excellent slow motion shots, brings the whole movie to life in a way that will invite you to watch again and again. To be honest, I am not sure that it has many, if any film rivals to compare against. Dana Braun's (the director, writer and narrator) witty and measured commentary adds a dimension rarely seen in such a genre. It is the one film I recommend time and again. The problem is that it leaches into you - to such an extent that I am now going to Baja next year to do a couple of exploratory runs following the same route as in the film and will (perhaps) compete in the race in 2011.",1241740800,,1283,4.323651452282157
2335476,4,B0009XT8C4,"One thing is certain in Baja, and that is that nothing is certain. This movie was beautifully filmed, showing some truly mystical moments that one would experience in the race of all races. The only reason why I gave this film a 4 star rating instead of 5, is because I felt the director spent a little too much time following the motorcycles, and not enough time displaying all which trophy trucks go through. I love all the classes of Baja; I don't think I'm alone on this when saying that Trophy trucks are the climax of the racing day.

So I was somewhat dissapointed when I realized I was only given maybe a solid 15 mins of trophy truck time, but nonetheless I still enjoyed watching this movie very much. For some time now, I've kept telling people that I want to race in the Baja 1000 one day, and all I get is negative feedback, on what a challenge it is, or how expensive a race it is to compete in. But I don't want to let that stop me, these great racers made it, so why can't I??? This movie made me internalize my feelings towards Baja even more, the landscaping is so beautiful at times with the trucks roaring through, that I felt tear jerking moments of happiness.

This movie really shows what kind of experience it really is, and it made me want to push to make it there myself! Watching this movie in HD with dolby digital made the experience even more enjoyable, but I think anyone can appreciate this film.",1237248000,,1428,4.344569288389513

There was only 4 people in the theatre and it had only been out for a couple of days. Too much interviewing and going back to people. All the action is cut and it sucked!

2335537,5,B0009XT8C4,"That Bruce Brown's son Dana, lensed this film comes as no surprise.""Dust To Glory"" places us squarely inside the Baja 1000. Dana Brown uses his father's film format, that worked well with films such as ""On Any Sunday"" and ""The Endless Summer"". In a sense, ""Dust To Glory"" is an extension of ""On Any Sunday"".

It shows the personal battles of each team, racing against the clock to win. There are a number of crashes, breakdowns, and much humor, to keep you occupied. Each of the ""Major"" teams are showcased, and you are kept abreast of all changes that take place during the race. The number of ""mechanical oddities"" abound in this film, and Class 11, or the VW Bug class, is given some time. you gotta hand it to these VW Bug drivers, THEY'RE CRAZY!!

This race was almost consigned to oblivion back in the 80's, because there were a rash of deaths associated with crashes that were purposely caused by Mexican locals, for their trucks and buggies, so they could be sold. Apparently, this practice has been stopped, because the Baja 1000 brings in much-needed American dollars into the Mexican economy.

There are some well-known racers showcased, as well. Mario Andretti, Robby Gordon, Johnny Campbell and a returning J.N. Roberts (he was in the original ""On Any Sunday"").

""Dust To Glory"" is an entertaining look at a classic American race that has gone on, despite it's ""infamous"" reputation, to attract racers from all disciplines. Good job, Dana, your Father would be proud!",1206576000,,1480,4.81496062992126

A film by Dana Brown, the grandson of film maker Bruce brown, who shot a film of the first Baja in 1967 for CBS' Wide World of Sports, comes off the beach of Step Into Liquid to the dust & silt of Baja, Mexico.
Shot with over 55 cameras, 3 helicopters & some home movie footage, Dust To glory is one very entertaining & informative film.
Covering the 2004 SCORE/Tecate Baja 1000 from Encinada to La Paz Mexico, Dana shows us some of the most grueling, exciting, ""what were you thinking"" racing on the planet.
As the narrator, he puts a feel to the film that makes the viewer want to be there.
From the Class 11 stock pre-1985 Volkswagen Beetles to the million dollar Trophy Trucks, the race is open to all who have the entry fee cash.
Focusing on Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy, an amateur motorcross champion, who decides to race the whole 1000 miles alone, the viewer sees quickly what this race will do to a person both physically & mentally.
Stars include Robbie Gordon of NASCAR fame & various dirt racers that fans will definately recognise.

As documentaries go, this one definitely stands to be more entertaining than average.  The sad truth is anyone not interested in the subject matter will find this relatively boring if they can get over Dana Brown's excessive use of the word ""synonymous""

At times this documentary can be slightly discontinuous, but overall I think Brown does a decent job of really capturing the spirit of the 1000 which is undoubtedly uplifting.",1201305600,,560,5.131868131868132

We used to have a saying in racing: ""Two Taps, ""Two Toots, Two Tons""... it's in the film, too! When you're behind someone you want to pass, you have to let them know (no one has rearview mirrors). So, you run up and hit their bumper twice (two taps). Then you honk your horn twice (two toots). If they don't get out of your way, you run them off the road (two tons of car!)

My wife, who absolutely hates motorcycles, nonetheless talked about this video non-stop on the long drive home after watching it with our friends.

The Baja 1000 needs NO enhancement!!  What I wanted to see was more SUSTAINED footage of the vehicles in action.  Yes, there is some of that, but not enough.  Just like concert videos and other sports footage, WE WANT  TO SEE THE ACTION!!!  that means NOT cutting back and forth like a mainiac, hey, this is just because I care man.",1139270400,28,496,4.455555555555556

Sound design IS such an integral part of making a movie.  For example, the sound design of ""Master and Commander"" (A 5 Star movie, BTW!!!  Get the ""Collector's Edition!"") is so impecable that they used REAL Civil War artillery to get the sounds of the cannon fire ""correct"" and ""true to life.""  They also fired LIVE ROUNDS at wood pallets, to get the true to life ""splinter sounds.""

How can a modern day movie maker be soooooooo STUPID to ""dub"" the engine sound of a TWO STROKE dirt bike in the place of a FOUR STROKE Honda XR650R?!?!?  Maybe possibly because a racing two stroke engine actually ""sounds better?""  That is NO EXCUSE!!!  I'm sorry, wait NO I'M NOT.  This movie dropped the bomb over the HIGHEST CLIFF ON THE PLANET.

2335613,1,B0009XT8C4,"Don't believe the official blurb !!! It's false advertising and a complete waste of money.

After waiting months for Dust to Glory to come to Australian cinemas only to find that it wasn't to be released here, and the same with the DVD release after that, and then after having to buy it through Amazon.com just to get hold of a copy, and waiting for it to arrive in my mail box, and hurriedly unwrapping it and eagerly watching it, I soon realised why Dust to Glory was never released here......, it's crap !!!

After making such a superb surfing movie ""Step into liquid"" and such an exhilarating D2G trailer, Dana Brown took the awesome, heart stopping, thumping v8 action of the Baja1000 and made a kids fairy tale out of it. It couldn't have been more boring if the entire dvd was totally blank !!!  I was so disappointed in this film and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The whole plot is so disjointed it's like watching an episode of Day of Our Lives; you never see any excitement for more than a few seconds and it has more dialogue than action !!!

I was expecting something like the Paris~Dakar Raid or the Finke Desert Race in Australia which are more akin to what desert racing is all about. I wanted the full-on action of class 1 buggies and v8 trophy trucks, but all I got was whingey, whiney, woossy opinion, and interview after interview after interview. . . ,

Overall I'd call Dust to Glory a great cure for insomnia.",1136592000,4,1435,4.461832061068702

I have been to San Felipe several times and have been there on Race Day for the BAJA 250.  Although I have enjoyed being there in person, I did not think I would like to watch a whole DVD on the subject.  Boy was I mistaken.

Watching this DVD was like taking my first buggy ride!  I smiled the entire way through (but no sand in my teeth :) It was very interesting and fast paced.  I am now much more of a fan of this sport and cannot wait to go down to BAJA again to watch and be a part of this wonderful race.

The DVD captures the taste and flavour of an awesome desert race across part of Mexico. It shows the amateurs and the professionals, the two and four wheel competitors and the almost carnival atmosphere that surrounds the event.

2335636,5,B0009XT8C4,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? It's everything that I hoped it would be, and more. Scenery, action, human drama and emotions, inspirational and motivational (both in the movie, and in the ""extra"" content on the DVD)! Captivating action in a seductive yet challenging setting. It's gotten rave reviews from everyone I've shared it with--male or female, off-road racer/enthusiast or not.

While I can appreciate that the off-road enthusiast might prefer a greater percentage of the footage devoted to the actual racing action, I think that the content is near perfect for introducing the sport and its participants--and the Baja 1000 in particular--to the general public. Only a very small fraction of the film taken during this race made it into the final production. Hopefully with this movie serving as an introduction, there may be a follow-on with a somewhat greater percentage (but not exclusively) of the film devoted to the racing action.",1127952000,,959,5.147435897435898
2335647,4,B0009XT8C4,"I'm an avid off-road motorcyclist, and heard the hype about this movie for months before it was released. As soon as it was available on DVD I purchased it without hesitation.

Turns out it has the feel of a 'discovery channel' documentary to the whole movie, which is ok I guess, but I was expecting a lot more 1st person camera footage (from the bike during the race). Most of the time was devoted to the Honda XR650R motorcycle racers, but a fair amount of coverage was given to Robby Gordon (not sure why, I think he takes away from anything on TV anywhere). I like watching almost any kind of vehicle race off-road, and I must say there was a good mix between the bikes and trucks.

Overall it was a good movie, great if you consider how rarely we get a movie promoting off-road racing. There are some really awesome camera shots spread throughout the movie, some from helicopter and some from cameramen on bikes, I've gotta say those shots were breathtaking, but they didn't last very long and left me wanting more. I'm glad to see Baja finally get a good movie, but as with a lot of documentary type shows, it drops the ball and focuses a bit too much on non-race people and 'sideshow' happenings along the way. You get to meet people you could care less about, crazy drunks, orphans, etc all through the movie. You feel like they're trying to build up all these relationships with the audience, maybe even trying to get you to root for certain participants instead of just focusing on the race action like we're interested in. If you know how exciting an off-road race actually is, you will be dissappointed at certain points by the constant jumping away from the action. I think it veered away from the hard core race action to get the movie to appeal to more 'non-racer' types and/or women (lets face it, this is definitely a guy movie!).

Overall, I would recommend to any off-roader, but I'm holding out on that 5th star for the next movie!",1127952000,,1952,4.508474576271187

Some high-speed footage from his camera, going through different areas of the course, lasting a few minutes or more would really have conveyed the intensity and difficulty of the racing.",1127433600,,534,4.815217391304348

It really stuck me odd that after everything everyone went through, that 2nd overall didn't even get an interview at the finish. :-(
