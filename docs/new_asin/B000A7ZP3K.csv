8076034,4,B000A7ZP3K,"I would urge any fan or admirer of Sharon Tate to see this film. Not only is it enjoyable to see her carry a leading role but she is beautiful and charming. The film was shot in England and Italy in the late spring/early summer of 1969 and released in early 1970. During filming Sharon was pregnant and artful efforts were made to conceal this with the use of colorful scarves, vests, an oversized purse, etc. She still looks wonderful in miniskirts! I remember the advertising campaign urged filmgoers to 'Make a date to see Sharon Tate in her last film.' Vittorio Gassman handles the physical comedy well and you'll laugh at Orson Welles funny performance as the acerbic stage star. At this point the film is only available on VHS or Italian language DVD. Sharon shows considerable screen presence and the film gives a peek at what might have been in terms of her future career.",1402358400,3,880,4.611464968152866
8076035,3,B000A7ZP3K,"Filmed in the spring of 1969, this comedy about the hunt for a chair that has very valuable jewels in it was to be Sharon Tates final film before the Manson family invaded her Bel Air home and butchered she and her guests.  Sharon does a great job in the film and her penchant for comedy was beginning to peak.  The plot is a bit weak and

the budget for this film was not on par with her earlier work. Still a must for any Sharon Tate fan.  Also, the music in this film really helps the quality.  Great late 60s Burt Bacharach type soundtrack. It is sad watching this video as some scenes Sharon looks visably pregnant. Not the best of her short career, but worth it for this final film.

Released in early 1970, the film proved to be a box office failure.",1145836800,12,757,4.186206896551724
