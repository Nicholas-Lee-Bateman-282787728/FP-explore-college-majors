5559520,1,B00B657N6W,"I have the first 3 seasons of The Equalizer. The 2nd & 3rd season were released by a company called Fremantle Home Entertainment and they did a great job. The discs were in secure box-set packaging and included a booklet. The first thing I noticed with this one is it came in what looks like a 1-dvd box. Extremely cheap packaging. 2 of the dvd's were bouncing around loose inside the package. The video quality looks like someone recorded it off a VHS tape. Since I openned it I'm stuck with it, a $50 mistake. Beware. If you have an all-regions or region 2 player, order the season 4 discs from Fremantle Home Entertainment on amazon.uk instead. This is a region 4 dvd, might be why Universal went with a different company.",1370649600,25,725,4.5

5559528,2,B00B657N6W,We recently received season 3 and 4 of The Equalizer.  Season 3 arrived in a broken case and season 4 has a big scratch on disc 1 so it freezes up.  We cannot enjoy it like this.  We tried to contact  VEI directly by email and are being ignored.  This is very disappointing because we love this show and have been waiting a long time for it to come out on DVD.,1444694400,,360,3.9444444444444446

5559538,5,B00B657N6W,"The series stands up through time, Edward Woodward portrays the character exceptionally, makes it hard for anyone to beat.  Although there is a disclaimer about the quality because of the age of the series, I found no issues at all, the prints are clear, concise, vocal is great, all around recommend all of the series.",1437609600,,319,4.8
5559539,3,B00B657N6W,"What a shame that VEI (Visual Entertainment Inc) did such a poor job in packaging. Season 4 has six disc and the middle disc holder came broken. Season 3 had four disc yet is advertised as a six disc set. Amazon is great, the Equalizer TV series is good but VEI is poor.",1437436800,7,270,4.113207547169812

5559545,5,B00B657N6W,I enjoyed this set. I think it was a big improvement over season three. Edward Woodward was back. I do not know why this was the last season as it seemed to be improving at the end. I also enjoyed the greater use of Mickey Kostmeyer.,1433289600,3,233,4.086956521739131

5559547,2,B00B657N6W,"The first season was much better.  This season does not seem as polished and frankly the son is very irritating (plus the actor seems not very good).  Edward Woodward is a great actor but does not seem so here; thus I think it is the directing and the script writing.

I really like the premise but the memories of this show far exceed what I view now; I guess I got more sophisticated or more picky.",1431216000,2,400,4.2368421052631575

5559554,5,B00B657N6W,"THE EQUALIZER was the show you talked about with your friends and at work....
there are very few shows that you talk about.....I will never see the Equalizer movie
because for me there is only one EQUALIZER and he is Edward Woodward

This was a time when CBS programmers had brains",1427155200,6,281,4.509803921568627
5559555,4,B00B657N6W,It is all suspense TV series of late 80' & early 90's anyone didn't have chance to view the series nearly 20 years ago would enjoy.,1426464000,,131,4.076923076923077

5559564,5,B00B657N6W,"Stars are for the show.  Woodward's absence over a number of episodes was handled remarkably well, although I remember being frustrated at the time it originally aired.  Several of the discs will not play, however (they will  not load at all), and after returning for replacement, several different discs do not play from the replacement.  The quality control of VEI is not good, and they have not responded to my inquiry.  It's a terrible disappointment after waiting more than twenty years.",1421625600,,492,5.0246913580246915
