7853186,5,6303827624,An excellent film. A must see for all Laurel and Hardy fans.  This film is similar to a later L & H film called Laughing Gravy although unlike laughing gravy this film is silent and in this film the boys sneak not a dog but a goat in their apartment to hide from their landlord.,1391904000,,278,4.054545454545455
