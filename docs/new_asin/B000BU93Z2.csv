8092733,3,B000BU93Z2,"This DVD was not too bad. The actors were believable, at times you were kept in suspense. Tracey Gold played her role realistically. She was wrongly accused of murder and while in prison joins an elite unit of smokejumpers. Her aim is to rekindle  with her estranged daughter, Sophie.
