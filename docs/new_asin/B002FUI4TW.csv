3924046,5,B002FUI4TW,"I own over 200 DVDs and dance is by far my favorite.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this workout!  It is professionally done, and the moves are very easy and fun!  Jesus is an excellent instructor and I really liked his routine.  Also the Latin was very easy to follow and fun.  I would recommend this to anyone, I really enjoyed how they made the routines simple and upbeat.  I would buy the next one they put out.  I hope it's soon!",1256083200,9,423,4.148148148148148
3924047,2,B002FUI4TW,"As someone who LOVES to dance, this was so/so.  Crunch FItness usually puts together workout DVD's better than this, so in my opinion they rushed to slap this together because of the popularity of the show and nothing more!  Watch the dancer Michelle!  She looks as totally BORED as I was!  This might be for the extreme beginner or the hesitant to workout person, but a dancer or someone who is experienced will be totally disenchanted.",1255910400,,437,4.7105263157894735
3924048,2,B002FUI4TW,"This workout program was mediocre in my opinion.  I tried to do this for 15 minutes and became frustrated because they would simply do the moves without explaining how to do them or going through them slowly at first.  I don't have dance experience so it was frustrating because I couldn't just pick up the moves.  I need a little bit more structure than just watching someone do it then being told to copy them.  I'm going back to my Biggest Loser Workout Vol. 1, which is more structured with easier moves to do.",1255737600,2,514,4.4361702127659575
3924049,4,B002FUI4TW,"Awesome! i absolutely love it! its very easy and my body was definitely feeling the effects after the first workout. i attempted to just watch it the first time, but it looked so fun that i had to join in. Disco and latin are definitley my favs! Thanks DYAO!",1255564800,,258,4.285714285714286

8369542,5,B002FUI4TW,Fairly easy to follow for a beginner.,1455235200,,37,4.428571428571429
8369543,3,B002FUI4TW,I got this for my mom as a gift. She said it was just o.k. she got bored with it fast and only used a few times.,1417392000,,112,3.185185185185185
8369544,2,B002FUI4TW,"Saying "" easy dance "" every five seconds... it was slightly cute the first time.  I don't like the hip hop segment at all.  Hate to say it but I wasted my morning coffee money",1380585600,,175,3.9714285714285715
8369545,5,B002FUI4TW,"I really enjoy this workout, and I usually hate working out. The routines take a bit to get used to, but the instructors are very encouraging. This is definitely something that I can stick with. I'm so glad I ordered it. :-)",1278547200,2,224,4.357142857142857
8369546,4,B002FUI4TW,"I have been doing video workouts for about 8 yrs. I started this one by walking a mile or two, and then doing a segment or two of the video, until I was able to do the entire video in one workout. I like a little challenge, and felt it did a nice job on my core. This is a good one for the over 50 crowd.

8369547,4,B002FUI4TW,It took a few times to get used to the routines.  I definitely work up a sweat.  I really like the disco and latin routines.  It gets me moving and doing what I love - DANCING! The only issue I have is the cool down could be a little longer and include some stretching.,1270944000,3,269,3.9444444444444446
8369548,3,B002FUI4TW,This exercise DVD was just okay.  It wasn't really what I expected.  There wasn't as much of a workout as I expected.,1266364800,,117,4.2727272727272725
8369549,5,B002FUI4TW,This D.V.D.is not just fun - they make the moves very easy to follow. Love it!,1264809600,,78,3.9375
8369550,1,B002FUI4TW,"I expected this video to be a fun, high-energy cardio workout - I barely broke a sweat! The routines were entirely too easy, I found myself bored the whole time. I'm not in good shape, I don't work out (hardly ever!) and I'm not a dancer - this video should've kicked my butt and it did nothing of the sort. Save your money, this video isn't worth it!",1260662400,,351,4.176470588235294
