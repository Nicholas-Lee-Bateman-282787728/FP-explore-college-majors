8186062,5,B000OPPBA0,"This DVD provides a time-compressed introduction to a massive body of literature contributed by Emerson and written about him.  It is convincing enough to motivate some viewers to visit Emerson's home in Concord, Massachusetts and consider adopting some or all of Emerson's beliefs, ways of thinking and concepts of what America stands for and could become.",1400803200,5,357,5.375
8186063,5,B000OPPBA0,"I was thoroughly pleased with this informative and enjoyable documentary on Ralph Waldo Emerson.  After visiting Concord, Massachusetts last summer and touring the homes of Emerson and Alcott, I became very interested in their lives, thoughts and where they obtained their inspiration.  I was glad to find a this documentary.  I was so pleased, I immediately bought one and sent it to my mother to watch.  In addition, I will have my teenage daughter view it as well.  I now have great interest in learning about the Platonists and Neo Platonists, the influencers of the idealists of Concord. I  recently found David A. Beardsley's website, Ideal in the West and did not know he was connected to this dvd.  I was so impressed with that website and when I learned he wrote this documentary, I was inspired to write this review to praise it.  I plan to buy his book Ideal in the West as well.",1397174400,3,890,4.660256410256411

8186065,5,B000OPPBA0,"This is a superb documentary! I found it to be very well written, well-researched, well narrated, and well-produced.
I was also enchanted by the interviews with the authors and teachers who speak about Emerson with such praise, fervor and reverence, of which I am in great accord with.

Not only is it an illuminating portrait of one of our great early thinkers, but it was an epiphany for me to discover more about Emerson's life that I was not previously aware of. I had read quite a bit of Emerson's work, particularly his essays such as ""Nature,"" ""Self-Reliance,"" and ""The Oversoul,"" and found them to be immensely inspirational, profound, erudite, and sagacious.

As well, through this documentary, I came to discover that not only was he an superb writer, philosopher, and thinker, but a human being of great ethics and moral fiber. He was an early advocate not only for women's rights, but also for Native American and African American rights as well.

Yet I was not aware about much of the man himself nor of his life. I learned through this presentation how Emerson had traveled to Europe in search of the scope of intellectual history and it's scope and breadth. It discussed how Emerson went in search of Europe's great minds, poets, philosophers, and thinkers, which consequently inspired Emerson to formulate a philosophy of his own. Through the eastern wisdom of Hinduism, the philosophy of ideal of Plato, the precepts of transcendentalism of Kant, and the poetry of insight of the European romantic writers of the 19th century, Emerson weaves this rich tapestry with that of his own discoveries. This then inspires the further evolution of Emerson's own ideas, which he brings back to New England to present in future essays, books, and lectures so as to illuminate others in his circles, and eventually into the consciousness of America..",1229040000,8,1855,4.958199356913183
8186066,5,B000OPPBA0,"The lyrics to Jill Jackson's and Sy Miller's simple, beautiful 1955 song say ""Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me.""  This DVD, written and directed by David Beardsley, offers an excellent introduction to the life and ideas of an essential American thinker whose pursuit of the indwelling peace that can overcome the world deserves serious attention from every American - and indeed from every person in any country - who is troubled today by the violence and tyranny racking the whole earth and his or her own soul.  It is the intention of all those who collaborated on this video biography that those who watch it will be moved to read more by and about Ralph Waldo Emerson. I believe this will be its effect on most viewers, and that is a very good thing.",1187481600,18,774,4.521428571428571
