7091246,5,B00VJIIKG8,"This item met all my expectations. There is a variety of work out programs that challenges you, if you want to be motivated. Love it.",1472774400,,133,4.36
7091247,5,B00VJIIKG8,there is no better AB or cardio training then Billy. I do at least 4 times a week some kind of crossfit training but Billy does my ABs and weight. Love it!!!,1469577600,3,157,3.9375

7091249,5,B00VJIIKG8,"This is by far the best of the bootcamps I've done and of Billy Blanks as I advanced from basic bootcamp of his to these four. You can't and will not go wrong if u put your mind to it, work on the moves being right and rewinding until u get them right then move on, and PUSH your limits u WILL see results that I have in just one week of mixing up all four within just seven days. I feel strong and lean after and energized for the day. This IS advanced so start w basic tai bo and give the body a chance to get used to it all . I can't wait for the next levels!!!!

***High paced. You'll need to be in shape to do this and should have basic Tai Bo down and be pretty in shape to move this fastness. I kept up fine and I'm about 20lbs more to go overweight. I lost 65 prior w the help of his Basic Training Boot camp which curved me in all the right places. That too you'll need to be in shape and should know some basic low impact tai bo first .",1459296000,13,946,3.7537688442211055
7091250,5,B00VJIIKG8,Love this DVD. I like the fact that you're getting 4 workouts for the price of one. I use this along with the other ones that I have a few times a week.,1456876800,7,152,3.6363636363636362

7091252,5,B00VJIIKG8,What can I say as a form of martial artist I really appreciate the fact that Billy Blanks not only is trying to sell you a exercise video he is actually teaching people the basic fundamentals of multiple martial arts how to strike correctly how to kick correctly then add the cardio portion to this very well done as I've said before you can never go wrong with Billy Blanks,1517788800,,374,4.357142857142857

7091256,4,B00VJIIKG8,You have to like boxing. The only thing I don't like is some of the fast footwork but I just go at my own pace. Really great workout.,1508630400,,133,3.7857142857142856
7091257,3,B00VJIIKG8,"Great workout but the people in the video are obnoxious which is a HUGE distraction.  They all yell ""Yes sir"" every two seconds and make extremely odd faces.  Billy also repeats himself over and over.  Not sure I will keep this.  I may try with the volume all the way down.",1508457600,,273,4.294117647058823
7091258,5,B00VJIIKG8,"Good workouts, great for total body cardio!",1507766400,,43,5.285714285714286
7091259,5,B00VJIIKG8,"Billy's still got it.  These were great workouts - I was sore and sweaty, and as with any workout where you're only using your body, you control how good it is.",1506556800,3,160,4.161290322580645
7091260,5,B00VJIIKG8,"A decent workout for the price

7091262,5,B00VJIIKG8,I'm so glad that I decided to start working it out old school. I've lost 25 lbs from doing Billy Blanks and Kathy Smith dvds! Billy Blanks' moves are a really hard workout but easy to follow. I'll be ordering more in the future.,1500076800,3,228,4.204545454545454

7091266,5,B00VJIIKG8,"Well, my spouse loves it. My brain likes it because it is a good way to torture my body. Not sure how Billy and his Boot Camp Squad can smile and stay conscious throughout the workout. If you want to get in shape, this is a DVD that can get you started. If you can make it through the entire 30 minute workout and keep up the pace, then sit down and enjoy a nice meal and have a nap because you are already in shape!",1491004800,5,416,3.8488372093023258
7091267,5,B00VJIIKG8,"A plethora of taebo in one dvd is what i have been looking for.
I have 2 Billy Blanks Boot Camp cardio DVDs, but I get bored doing the same routine daily. What i like about this is that you have a choice to pick 4!
Out of all of them Boot camp workouts I think SOS is the least difficult one. Thats my personal opinion though. Oh, make sure you have 1 or 3 lb weights for the cardio sculpt! Enjoy!",1488672000,3,397,3.8536585365853657
7091268,4,B00VJIIKG8,You will need weights for some of the workouts on this video. I did not realize this I thought it would be like all others where they have a person that shows the moves with either other equipment or a varied les strenuous movements. It is a workout that will make you sweat!!,1485993600,8,276,4.226415094339623

8710326,5,B00VJIIKG8,"I am hardcore (Billy Blanks) Taebo fan, been doing taebo for many years now..This Bootcamp DVD are very intense!! I was sweating and out of breath within 10 mins of the actual workout lol. If you stick with this dvd for at least 1-2 months straight, and do the 4 exercises on a daily basis (and eat healthy) you are bound to drop some pounds and inches!! This DVD is a must have.",1531353600,,379,4.205479452054795
8710327,4,B00VJIIKG8,"Just got back into Billy Blanks, starting with my old school Bootcamp DVDs, and I'm really enjoying his classes again.  This is a great one to start with, as there are four moderately challenging classes to choose from, lasting from 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Great cardio workout that will get your heart rate up, but not much strength training.  All in all, a great buy!",1531094400,,368,4.545454545454546
8710328,5,B00VJIIKG8,Had Billy Blanks DVD's before and lost them in a move. Had to re- order because it's the only DVD I will use to exercise. They are definitely the best.,1530662400,,151,4.066666666666666
8710329,5,B00VJIIKG8,I don't know how old are Mr. Blanks exercises and DVDs but it is a great exercise and great cardio. It isn't easy to keep up with him but the more you do it the better you get at it.,1529452800,,182,3.575
8710330,5,B00VJIIKG8,I workout with colleagues and we all love Billy Blanks. One of the girls said she  lost a few inches around her belly after two weeks of 45 min workout with this amazing guy and so did I.  He inspires people. Really good. Highly recommended!,1528761600,,241,4.333333333333333
