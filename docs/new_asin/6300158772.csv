If you have never seen a silent film, you won't be disappointed in viewing this ""Little Tramp"" classic. Chaplin's  famous ""dancing dinner rolls""  stands out in my mind as one of  the most clever and charming scenes ever filmed. The film still evokes  emotion even today. One of the greatest films ever made.",928713600,,399,4.6571428571428575

212507,5,6300158772,"On the 1925 version:
I've seen several of Chaplin's films, but I never realized that he was almost as good a director as an actor.  He truly earns his keep as one of the all-time greats in this silent-era gem, displaying his genius on both sides of the camera. With numerous sight gags, poignant moments, and (for its time) cutting-edge special effects, this movie is a sheer delight, and not to be missed.

On the 1942 version:
If Chaplin had known that his 1925 version would be so beloved nowadays, then his 1942 version might never have been made.  Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but it's not just the same.  The nearest analogy I can think of is if Michelangelo had repainted the Sistine Chapel using cheap watercolor; sure, it might look like the original, but something would get lost along the way.",1484611200,,812,4.5793103448275865
212508,5,6300158772,"The quality of this DVD met my expectations very well.  The picture was sharp and clear throughout, the title cards (except for the opening) were the originals and easy to read, and the new (slightly off-key) piano accompaniment by Keith Taylor worked appropriately with the action and greatly enhanced the pleasure of viewing this Chaplin masterpiece.  I screened it recently for a mixed group of 7th/8th graders and adults who had never seen a silent movie and who knew about Chaplin only as an icon, and everyone was totally on-board with Chaplin as a performer & silent films by the end!  This one's a great introduction to silents in general, but all were surprised at how much fun it was and how much they related to it -- during the sad parts, I could hear the kids saying sympathetically, ""Oh! Poor Charlie!""  They really identified with him, were on the edge of their seats during his trials and struggles, couldn't get over the ""dance of the rolls,"" and LOVED the happy ending! :)  Everyone's ready for another silent and more Chaplin ASAP!",1482192000,,1050,4.747252747252747

212529,5,6300158772,"This movie is wonderful and hilarious in both the 1942 version and the 1925 version. However, if you want to watch it in all it's glory watch the 1925 version. For this reason and this reason only: The movement of the character coincides with the story. For example: In the 1925 version Georgia does not write the letter for the tramp but for Jack. Jack does not care for the letter and decides to trick the tramp into believing it was meant for him. So when the tramp starts giving Georgia a heartfelt monologue of his love for her and how he completely understands her sentiments Georgia has an expression of confusion. She doesn't know what he's talking about, and you can tell by the way she looks. But in the 1942 version they make it look like the tramp was the one intended to receive the letter in the first place. So when he gives his heartfelt monologue to Georgia her expression of confusion does not make sense. She would surely be hugging him back and have an expression of love, not one of confusion. There's also the bit where they are trapped in the Cabin at the end and they are wondering why they feel like they are rocking back and forth. The tramp claims it's the stomach first, then when they feel the house rocking again and they try jumping up and down to see if it is indeed the house the tramp makes an expression as if to say ""it must be the stomach, there's no other explanation"" But in the 1942 version this part is shown with Charlie in the background saying ""It isn't the stomach"" Which again does not make sense with the movement of the character. So yeah watch the 1925 version for the correct experience. And the best one. 1942 is good, but not the correct way to watch it.",1440720000,3,1706,4.367924528301887

I owned the standard dvd version which still had a number of picture imperfections despite an impressive restoration effort and now Critierion has had a hand at improving upon that version in 1080p format.  The result while still not perfect is certainly an improvement over the standard dvd.  This version has both the original 1925 silent as well as my personal preference the 1942 Chaplin-narrated version.  The picture quality of the 1925 version unsurprisingly isn't nearly as good as the 1942 version while the latter version still does have a few imperfections despite the restoration efforts but is probably the best version of this film that is currently out there.  The famous dance of the rolls is in this film among many classic moments that instantly endear the tramp to our hearts.  This is my third favourite Chaplin film after ""City Lights"" and ""Modern Times"" but it is still an essential silent to own and in this Criterion version you get the definitive versions for now.

212552,4,6300158772,"""The Gold Rush"" is a silent comedy with Charlie Chaplin. It walks a very tricky line between laugh-out loud comedy, and tear jerking drama. It's a very difficult task to pull off, and it's done very well by the comedic genius of Charlie Chaplin.

The story follows the Little Tramp as he tries to make millions by striking gold in Alaska. What ensues are some of the most beautiful comedic sketches of Chaplin's career, from eating his own boot as he's starving, to dancing with bread rolls on the end of knives.

This little gem is definitely worth watching.",1392940800,2,559,4.636363636363637

Criterion did their homework as always and have the closest thing to original edit on this DVD as well as the newer one that was produced by Chaplin much later. Pick and choose which one you prefer. I am a purist, so I watch only the original, and it is simply fantastic.

212555,5,6300158772,"A classic Chaplin masterpiece that contains both the shoe-eating incident (inspired by a true story) and the dancing dinner rolls-on-forks scene (inspired by Fatty Arbuckle, but improved upon by Chaplin), the film is full of funny scenes, like Charlie oblivious to being followed by a bear, the cane-in-the-snow scene, and masterpieces of physical comedy like the windy doorway, and the teetering house (and its narrow escape). Big Jim hallucinating and seeing Charlie as a man-sized chicken is also sheer genius. Theres still a scary moment when Black Larsen kills two men in cold blood, but also some sexy romancing (and, in one of the versions of the film, a long lingering kiss).

This DVD comes with two versions of the movie, the original 1925 release, and a 1942 re-release version that is narrated by Chaplin and has the scene description cards removed (unnecessary). Its certainly a strange format, but interesting enough given that its Chaplins own voice. Chaplin also wrote an original soundtrack for this version  talk about attention to detail! Funny dialogue works its way in, like Im going away, and when I return I shall come back, and I said don't breathe, stupid. Funny how Big Jim looks like Peter Grant, the manager of Led Zeppelin.

On top of the two versions of the film, the DVD contains many bonus features such as a five-minute intro, another episode of Chaplin Today (27 minutes) trailers (8:46), and 25 posters. The intro explains how the shoe-eating story was inspired by the tale of the Donner party disaster in the Sierra Nevada mountains, when travelers were trapped by the snow and survived through cannibalism and eating their moccasins. We also get a scene of Mary Pickford recounting in 1965 how Chaplin had visited her and Douglas Fairbanks at their home Pickfair, and had looked at 3-D stereoscopic images of the Gold Rush and seen the incredible images of the winter queue at Chilkoot Pass. We also get scenes of Lita Gray talking about Chaplin in 1980, discussing his directorial style. This was the first film Chaplin started with a fully-developed script, something he wouldnt do again until 1947 and Monsieur Verdoux. He cast Lillita McMurray, who was also in The Kid, now 16, and she became his lover  and was soon pregnant. Renamed Lita Gray, both were miserable in the marriage; Lita was replaced in the film by Georgia Hale, and production dragged on. The Chilkoot Pass scene was reproduced in the Sierra Nevada mountains by creating in mid-winter a 700 metre path at 3,300 metres, using 600 tramps brought in from Sacramento as extras. Chaplin intended to do the whole film there, but it was difficult to shoot scenes there (only a few made it into the film, like Big Jim chasing the Little Tramp around in the snow), so they reproduced Alaska on the United Artists lot in Los Angeles using a backlot, a constructed mountain scene, and 100 barrels of flower

The film was a huge success, with some audiences demanding an encore of the dinner rolls dance scene. Imagine something like that happening today!!",1381708800,3,3053,4.897485493230174
212556,5,6300158772,"Chronicling the misadventures of Charlie Chaplin's tramp character in the gold fields of the Klondike in 1898, The Gold Rush is remembered for numerous iconic scenes, the two most famous being the eating of the boiled shoe, and the dance of the Oceana rolls. Criterion's recent release offers viewers a chance to own a piece of movie history, a film which is deservedly in the top-ten for box office receipts. Featuring newly restored prints of the original 1925 silent film as well as the 1942 sound-added re-issue, plus a fine lineup of extras, this home video permits an in-depth look at an all-time classic.

Aside from early two-reelers, Chaplin retained ownership of his films. When he cut The Gold Rush from 89 minutes to 72 minutes for the 1942 re-issue, he declared the new sound-added film to be the definitive version. In 1953, Chaplin ordered the copies of the 1925 silent version which were under his control to be destroyed. Fortunately, copies were too widely distributed to completely eradicate the 1925 version, and film historians Kevin Brownlow and David Gill combined two nearly complete prints, one from Japan and one from Germany, to come up with a reconstruction of the 1925 film. In comparing the two versions released 17 years apart, I was a bit surprised that the shortened film is actually superior, with Chaplin's narration delightful, and his music a real enhancement.

I thought a reduction of 17 minutes in running time would mean the loss of large chunks of the story, but in fact nothing of importance was lost. The time difference was made up mostly by the removal of on-screen inter-titles, not needed in the 1942 narrated version; and tightening of scenes by trimming redundant footage. The only substantive alteration was slight, changing a cruel love-note joke perpetrated by a rival into a real note sent directly to ""the little fellow"", as Chaplin called his character.

As is usually the case with Criterion, the extras alone are worth the price of admission. Among the extras are details of the rescue and restoration of the 1925 cut, the creation of special effects, an extensive interview with composer/conductor Timothy Brock about Chaplin's movie music, an audio commentary with the film, and an essay in booklet form. Another extra is an interview with a filmmaker in Burkina Faso, which includes scenes of African school children seeing Chaplin for the first time on a small television screen.

While this film is a treasure for movie fanatics and Chaplin fans, it is first-time viewers who have the most to gain. For them The Gold Rush is a revelation, and it will remain a fond memory for life.",1380326400,,2644,4.9348314606741575

212558,5,6300158772,"Criterion Collection has really outdone themselves with their 2012 Special Edition Blu-Ray of ""The Gold Rush"".  I have seen ""The Gold Rush"" many times throughout my lifetime, but NEVER like this!  The restoration of ""The Gold Rush"" on this release is astounding...both the re-edited 1942 definitive version and the recently reconstructed silent version of the original 1925 film.  All aspects of it are flawless.  However, for my taste, I prefer the 1925 silent film version, for the same reason many other reviewers have said.  And the new musical accompaniment recorded for the silent version, based on Chaplin's score of the 1942 version, is just breathtaking.  I was fortunate enough to see a special screening of the 1925 reconstruction in Chicago last year and I absolutely fell in love with this movie.

Moving on to the extras on the set.... all the supplements on this release are brand new, except for one.  And each of them are fantastic and fascinating to watch/hear.  As a life-long silent and classic film fan, these new documentaries truly enhanced my experience of watching this film.  In particular, I especially enjoyed the making-of documentary on the 1925 reconstruction by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill...and only wished it was longer and had even more in-depth information about the whole process.  One of my other favorites was the ""Music by Charlie Chaplin"" documentary.  After watching it, I was left with an entirely new appreciation for Chaplin as a composer.  Excellent and so moving.  But the very best supplemental material on this release is the commentary done by author and historian Jeffrey Vance, on the optional audio track that accompanies the 1925 version of the film.  It is by far one of the most comprehensive and entertaining film commentaries I have heard.  He tells you all the information you want to know about the film and Chaplin...and then some.  He certainly knows his stuff and would love to hear more commentaries by Mr. Vance.

Even if you've watched this film before and liked it, buy the Criterion Collection's Blu-Ray!  I highly recommend it for all classic film fans everywhere.",1371427200,3,2135,5.048571428571429

I have used other copies of the film, but I must say that this  version has the sharpest, clearest, cleanest pictures of any of the two video tapes and one CD that I have used.  Not only is the sound track close to what Chaplin originally intended, it is well-recorded -- clear and clean, and synced to every scene.  I used this version for the first time this school year.

212565,5,6300158772,"The Criterion Collection's remastered The Gold Rush (1925) is undoubtedly the Charlie Chaplin release of 2012. For years, the prevailing critical consensus was that Gold Rush was Chaplin's feature film masterpiece. However, a newer generation of critics have since argued that honor should go instead to City Lights (1931). The Gold Rush receives criticism for its episodic structure; however, all of Chaplin's features, including City Lights, are episodic to a degree. This is not necessarily a bad thing, making that a moot critique.

The Criterion Collection release features the 1925 original, along with the 1942 re-edit that omitted the intertitles in favor of narration (by Chaplin) and economically trimmed down of some excess plot developments. While the 1942 version does look better and the editing is better paced, Chaplin's voice-over actually dates the film far worse than the silent original.

Chaplin had a voice which carried well into the sound era. He intuitively knew that silent film was a different art form, however. Thinking about marketing, he seemed to have forgotten that fact. The 1942 version illustrates the artist's discomfort with sound. Chaplin never could wrap his art around the new sound medium, and he pointlessly tells us what we are already seeing. Some may prefer the 1942 version, but my concentration will be on the superior, original version that audiences of 1925 saw.

While The Gold Rush exhibits Chaplin's characteristic pathos, here it is far better balanced with his brand of comedy than any of his other features (when the pathos, often, nearly soaked the films).

Chaplin's increasing need for audience sympathy marred may of his later features. Here, he keeps that need in check, and all for the better. Chaplin's Mutual shorts are considered by many (including Chaplin) to be his best work. One of the reasons for that is the presence of his best nemesis in Eric Campbell. But, when Campbell was killed in an automobile accident in 1917, Chaplin was left without a great heavy. His first feature film, The Kid (1921) was able to bypass that. For this, Chaplin's second Tramp feature, two villains were needed: the bonafide villain Black Larson (Tom Murray) and reformed villain Big Jim McCay (Mack Swain). While neither Swain nor Murray could replace Campbell, they were aptly cast and give the film needed tension.

The Gold Rush`s most discussed scene is the dance of the dinner rolls, often imitated (and usually badly--Chaplin was a master at utilizing props for something other than their intended use).  What may be the most compelling scene, however, is the surreal chicken hallucination. Everyone has seen this scene spoofed in countless Looney Tune shorts. The starving villain (Swain) imagines his buddy (Chaplin) to be a walking meal (in this case, a plump chicken). Chaplin's shoe-eating scene (complete with shoe laces substituting for noodles) and the rocking house at the edge of the cliff are additional surreal vignettes.

While Chaplin was never a Surrealist, many of his films contained surreal vignettes. The Kid had the dream of heaven, Sunnyside (1919) has the Tramp frolicking in a ballet with hill nymphs. Perhaps it was Chaplin's occasional, natural elements of Surrealism which endeared him to the movements luminaries, such as Andr Breton. Next to Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton, Chaplin was the filmmaker most cited by the Surrealists.

As The Gold Rush progresses, hunger, the struggle for survival, and harsh elements give way to a soapy romance with the dance hall girl Georgia (Georgia Hale). Chaplin had originally cast 15 year-old Lita Grey in the role, but his getting her pregnant necessitated a new lead actress. While Chaplin does milk sympathy as a rejected lover, he never does it (here) at the expense of the film's comedic tone.

As to be expected, the Criterion extras are abundant: both film versions, a 15 minute short (Presenting The Gold Rush), audio commentary, booklet, a look at Chaplin the composer, and James Agee's famous 1942 review of the film.

See, Chaplin re-released The Goldrush in 1942, adding a new score and also narrating throughout the film.  Personally, I hate the narration.  I feel that it killed the beauty and intimacy of the movie.  Since I first saw the film, I've always had this problem:  I loved the beautiful score Chaplin wrote, but hated the narration.
Anyways, this release includes both the 1942 re-release and the 1925 original WITH CHAPLIN'S SCORE!  The music is so beautiful and completely changes the viewing experience.

What's most notable is the way they restored the 1925 version (using digital cleaning-up) and added newly recorded music, based on the 1942 score composed by Chaplin. Of course they also include the 1942 version which also looks very good.  Also I found the bonus material on the special camera they used to create the optical effects (ex. Black Larsen getting what he deserved).  The narration on the second audio track by the biographer provides good insight into Chaplin and this film.  I highly recommend getting this re-release of ""The Gold Rush,"" especially if you own a Blu Ray player and if you are a big fan of Chaplin like me.  I only regret not waiting to buy this video through Amazon.

212582,5,6300158772,"This has been a long time coming but we now finally have Chaplin's 1925 original release in a form that does justice to what many feel is his masterpiece. Kevin Brownlow and the late David Gill have worked many years on gathering the material from archives and collectors that would allow for a decent reconstruction of THE GOLD RUSH as it was originally shown. In 1942 Chaplin prepared a sound release in which he removed the titles, added a delightful narration that he spoke himself (at least in the English language release) and composed a music score that is perfect for the film. In doing so he went back to his vaults and chose different takes that played better at the 24fps sound speed. In the process the original 1925 negative was partly used and the sound version became the version that Chaplin preferred. In 1942 audiences were delighted with the new approach as films from the silent era as a rule were not being reissued. Over the years interest in silent films has made a come back and there are many who regret not being able to enjoy THE GOLD RUSH as it was original shown. Now on the Criterion release we have a beautifully restored copy of both releases. Criterion has gone the extra mile with the 1925 version and removed scratches and dirt so that the film looks the best it has since its original release. Now thorough the efforts of Timothy Brock, who has reconstructed Chaplin's music from the 1942 release, we can watch the film with the music that it should be heard with. With the excellent extras, booklet and restoration there is no question that the Criterion release is one of the most important releases ever. While the Blu-ray is marvelous the DVD release will also be a big improvement over any previous release. And even if you are not a fan of the 1942 release you can use this version to introduce younger children (who do not yet read well enough for silent titles) to the art of Chaplin. I've done this and their response is wonderful. And yes there are some differences between the two releases. Take a look at the letter Georgia Hale writes after not showing up for the New Year's dinner that Charlie has worked so hard to prepare. And for my money the ending of the film works far better in the 1925 release. Judge for yourself.",1340409600,32,2272,4.557457212713937

212584,5,6300158772,"Charlie Chaplin's 1925 masterpiece, THE GOLD RUSH, is one of the most widely beloved movies ever made. That's easy to understand, as its comedy and romance have a universal appeal that hasn't dated in 87 years.

Besides containing two of Chaplin's most famous comic sequences - the boiled shoe and the dance of the dinner roles - THE GOLD RUSH radiates a warmth that contrasts beautifully with the cold, snowy locale of its story. I love everything Chaplin did, but if I had to pick one film that represents his genius, I guess it would be a toss-up between THE GOLD RUSH and MODERN TIMES (1936), depending on which one I saw last.

Criterion's Blu-ray edition of THE GOLD RUSH is a must, chiefly because we finally get a restored version of the original 1925 release cut. I've always preferred it over Chaplin's 1942 reissue (also included on this disc), which he shortened, and added his own narration and music score. The score is, like all of Chaplin's film music, sublime, and it's been adapted and expanded by composer Timothy Brock for the silent version.

THE GOLD RUSH contains all the ingredients needed to make a great, timeless comedy,
and Criterion's wonderful Blu-ray edition is the one to  get. Like genuine gold itself, this film classic's sparkle will last forever.",1340064000,13,1282,4.8136363636363635
212585,5,6300158772,"Finally - a beautiful print of the 1925 silent (original) version of Chaplin's greatest film!

The 1942 version (which is the first version in this set) is his ""all-talking"" re-edit of this classic, and no matter what his estate says about this being his final word on the film, it stinks. The narration is hokey and unnecessary. He also cut the ending kiss from the film out of spite; he had had an affair with Georgia Hale that ended badly after the picture was wrapped up. He must have held a grudge against her for decades, because her role is diminished throughout the 1942 re-edit, and many ""glamorous"" close-up shots of her in the original were replaced with bland medium-shots in the re-edit.

The 1925 print is very clean and crisp; there's no reason to watch the 1942 version.

Kudos to Criterion for doing such an excellent job on both versions. Throw away any other DVDs you may have of this film.

Oh, and I forgot to mention - if you've never seen it, this movie is hilarious and highly recommended!",1340064000,9,1013,4.580110497237569
212596,5,6300158772,"The Gold Rush, its director and star Charles Chaplin once said, was the film by which he most wanted to be remembered. And why not? It is more than a comedy, more than a drama--it is an epic; one of only two comedy epics made during the silent era, the other being Buster Keaton's Civil War classic, The General. But while The General has been readily available to film collectors for years, The Gold Rush has become more elusive, especially the original 1925 silent version. In 1942, Chaplin recut the film, added a score, and (regrettably) added his narration, detailing the exploits of his tramp character--or ""The Little Fellow,"" as he refers to his creation. This version, although pictorially beautiful (it was, after all, struck from the film's camera negative), is hard to watch. It seems ironic that during the tumultuous transition from the silent to the sound era, Chaplin adamantly defended ""the great beauty of silence,"" yet when he finally found his voice, he never stopped using it. The spell he casts with his eloquent pantomime is marred by his incessant voice-over descriptions. Because the reissue was the official version of The Gold Rush, it has been seen more often than the way it appeared in 1925. Fortunately, thanks to the renowned Criterion Collection, which has just released the definitive Blu-ray of The Gold Rush, this has been rectified. Photoplay Productions, Ltd., of London England, headed by the venerable Kevin Brownlow and the late David Gill, restored the film to its original glory, removing Chaplin's over-written narrative and replacing it with the spare intertitles the filmmaker favored in his better days. Best of all, the beautifully evocative score he wrote for the 1942 sound reissue has been retained, albeit properly expanded by composer Timothy Brock and recorded by Brock and the Orchestra Citta Aperta in 2011. So, now, we have the original film, with Roland Totheroh's cinematography on view in high definition, presented in the proper aspect ratio of 1.33:1, and the stunning musical score in 5.1 surround sound. And, for the completists among us, the 1942 ""talkie"" version is on the disc as well, serving as an historic curio, if nothing else.

212600,5,6300158772,"As a rather massive fan of ""Looney Tunes,"" seeing the original material that inspired the famous animated shorts is almost like viewing the Holy Grail. Charles Chaplin should be considered inspirational anyway; not just towards those who pursue comedy, but also for writing, voiceover work, musical composition, and even filmmaking. Choosing where to start in Chaplin's filmography may be a bit overwhelming, but ""The Gold Rush"" is a fantastic place to begin. Not only is it an incredible film, but several scenes stick out because they've been referenced in things everyone seems to love.

A lone prospector (Chaplin) travels to Klondike in hopes of striking it rich. Along his journey, he meets the likes of a wanted criminal named Black Larsen (Tom Murray), another prospector named Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) who has found ""a mountain of gold"" but can't remember its location, and becomes love stricken with a saloon girl named Georgia (Georgia Hale).

""The Gold Rush"" is a comedy, first and foremost, and it delivers that in full. Most of Chaplin's comedy is funny because of his body language; his ability to portray humor with a single expression, hand movement, or reaction is unprecedented. Slapstick plays a big role as Chaplin falls down more times than you can count and the way he sells getting hit in the face with snowballs is just one of a kind.

The comedy is where the references come in. The ""dance of the dinner rolls"" is probably the most recognizable as Abe Simpson did the same thing on ""The Simpsons"" while the show was in its prime. Chaplin cooking his boot and eating it with Mack Swain is pulled off really well. How many times have you seen Wile E. Coyote do something similar? Big Jim seeing the prospector as a chicken is a personal favorite as ""Wackiki Rabbit"" plays that concept up to the fullest. Lastly, the blizzard and the struggle to find food is reminiscent of a Daffy Duck cartoon entitled ""Daffy's Southern Exposure."" Other than ""The Simpsons,"" both ""Looney Tunes"" shorts came out around the time Chaplin's re-release of ""The Gold Rush"" was in theaters (1942).

What makes ""The Gold Rush"" so special is that it also seems to blend a few other genres in with its comedy. It's billed as a ""dramatic comedy,"" so there's obviously some drama in there. You feel bad for The Lone Prospector/The Tramp as his luck only continues to get worse as the film progresses. Will his luck ever turn around? Does Geogia feel the same way about him? Can a tramp strike it rich? Meanwhile, this blossoming love story between The Tramp and Georgia is also trying to make its way to the foreground. It's very unusual and jumps around quite a bit, but the love story is still in there like the gooey center in the middle of thick, hard, candy coating.

""The Gold Rush"" is a wonderfully charming classic. The comedic bits are both memorable and humorous, the score is exquisite, and it looks pretty darn great for being as old as it is. It's the type of film that makes you tumble through a handful of emotions and yet, by the time it ends, you're left with that tingling sensation in your chest. It's definitely a feel good type of film that is timeless in the sense that it'll be enjoyable now and 100 years from now.

The Criterion Collection Blu-ray is pretty loaded with special features. The single disc includes both versions of the film: the 1925 silent version and the 1942 rerelease sound version. The 1925 version is 88 minutes long and your typical silent film with only title cards and music to accompany the video. The 1942 version completely does away with the title cards. Chaplin himself provides narration for the entire film (and sounds like one of those radio newscasters from the early 1900s; it's great). There's also added music and sound effects while certain scenes are a bit longer in comparison to the original film.

The 1942 version is the vision Charlie Chaplin is most happy with, but the 1925 version is preferable. ""The Gold Rush"" just seems to work better as a silent film than a forced talkie.

Supplements include Presenting ""The Gold Rush"" (16 minutes long), Chaplin Today: ""The Gold Rush"" (27 minute documentary), A Time of Innovation: Visual Effects in ""The Gold Rush"" (19 minutes long), Music by Charles Chaplin (25 minutes long), four trailers, audio commentary on the 1925 version with Charlie Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance, and an essay by critic Luc Sante and James Agee's review of the 1942 rerelease.

Criterion's ""The Gold Rush"" is now available on single disc DVD and Blu-ray. The 1925 version of the film includes a new 2K digital transfer of the reconstructed original film with a newly recorded adaptation of director Charlie Chaplin's score, and is presented in 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio.

212604,5,6300158772,"Timeless Comedy about Little Tramp arriving in the Yukon as a prospector looking for Gold and finding hilarity, success and romance. Classic sequences abound from the unforgettable Shoe eating scene to the dance of the dinner rolls and the Cabin teetering over the cliff.

Chaplin is brilliant in this picture as the lonely and courageous Tramp. His story in this one is somewhat simpler than his later films but perhaps that's what makes this his best. This is a simply told tale that is brought off incredibly well. Chaplin's film and character is the most miraculous combination of slapstick and sentiment ever seen. We relate to this tramp and empathize with his plight and we feel joy when he finds purpose.

The cast adds immeasurably, particularly the unforgettable Mack Swain as the burly prospector, Big Jim Mckay who so memorably chases Chaplin through the cabin as he mistakes him for a chicken. The actor and Chaplin play off each other incredibly well and there friendship is one of the film's highlights.

Georgia Hale is a gorgeous lead. Independant and yet, vulnerable, her character is probally Chaplin's best developed female lead with the possible exception of Paulette Goddard in ""Modern Times(1935)"". Hale's character is in need of fullfillment and redemption, just as much as Charlie is and the conclusion where both end up with each other romantically, we feel that she has won just as much as he has. She is better off with earning the love of this good man. It should be noted that thsi ending is probally one of the only REAL happy endings in Chaplin's career. There's no ambiguity or message. Things just work out and that's the way it is.

Chaplin's film strikes a chord with it's emotional complexity. The film has several funny stand out moments but it's the warmth that forms the center of the film. Chaplin dervies most of the humor through the darkest means. Alot of the ideas were found from his own childhood and the theme of Starvation and the importance of food plays a large role in the film. Even taboo subjects like CANNIBALSIM play a large role in the Comedy. Several films have used the concept of starvation making one mistake another for a food, but it's Chaplin that made it his own. Chaplin as the Chicken from Big Jim's imagination is one of the great comic images. Chaplin himself performed inside the suit.

There are no standard villians in the role, only catalysts. There is a villainous character named ""Black Larsen"" but he is killed off halfway through and the true ""bad guy' is the elements themselves. In a way this may seem more Keaton than Chaplin but it works immeasurably and is more relateable for Chaplin in his general battle against adversity. The world may be seemingly against Chaplin but he'll battle it and we the audience are convinced that he'll come out on top. It's a wonderful, enpowering message that few but Chaplin could make so uterly believable.

This film was my introduction to the Little Tramp properly. I had first seen the film as part of a Comedy Triple Feature Video that my grandmother had bought for me. The other two films were Laurel and Hardy's ""The Flying Deauces"" and the Martin and Lewis vehicle, ""At War With the Army"". The Chaplin film was last on the video and it mesmerized me. Rarely did a film amaze me enough that I found myself watching immediately after it had finished, but that's exactly what I did. I watched the film numerous times over the years until this wonderful DVD release became available.

Despite the price tag the DVD is completely worthwhile. The film has never looked better and the set is filled with extras. They include the 1940 reissue version with Chaplin's narration and the 1925 Original, restored and remastered as well as being rescored with Chaplin's original score. Both are VERY different versions with alternate takes and extended scenes in the 1925 version and an abridged ending in the 1940 version.
The DVD also includes an informative documentary on the film's impact and an introduction to the film that serves as a making of feature. Also several photos and posters are included as well.

This is simply put one of the greatest motion pictures of all time and essential viewing for the serious film buff and Comedy afficionado alike. If you have not have had the pleasure of meeting Charlie yet, it's about time to make your first meeting via this imperishable Classic.

Enjoy.",1245801600,3,4415,4.8063241106719365
212605,4,6300158772,"This 2-disk set is a great resource for those interested in ""The Gold Rush,"" Charlie Chaplin's 1925 comedy about Alaskan gold prospecting. The main disk contains the 1942 re-release, which did away with interscene placards, replacing them with a voiceover by Chaplin himself. The second disk included the original 1925 silent release. Both versions were accompanied by a wonderful piano arrangement that was timed with the movie action. The second disk also contains a ""making of"" shorts that described Chaplin's off-screen romances with his leading ladies as well as footage of an older Chaplin reprieving one of his movie routines. Another short describes the effect that Chaplin had on an African filmmaker. The extras are by no means comprehensive, but have enough meat to satisfy the casual student of Chaplin and early cinema.

The film is terrific and sometimes funny, and always watchable. Chaplin's ""Little Tramp"" character delves into the Alaskan wilderness, seeking his fortune as a gold prospector. He encounters other prospectors, good and bad, and falls in love with the lovely Georgia, who seems at first not to notice him. There is great pathos as well as comedy in the film. A scene in which Chaplin prepares a New Years' Eve party for Georgia and her friends, who have forgotten their promise to attend, is quite affecting. The misery is offset somewhat by one of Chaplin's great routines -- set in a scene that imagines how the party would have gone -- in which Chaplin sticks forks into two dinner rolls and makes these ""feet"" dance beneath his sad sack face. Other notable scenes include one in which the Little Tramp, being thrown out of the rude cabin he shares with Black Larsen, slips and slides in his struggle against a fierce wind that blows him back into the cabin. Another scene in which Larsen fights another prospector for control of a shotgun -- managing to point it at the Little Tramp no matter where he flees -- is perfectly-choreographed and fraught with comedic tension. AN early scene, in which a lone Chaplin navigates a narrow mountain ledge -- sometimes followed by a live bear -- are beautifully timed.

I preferred the 1925 version to the slicker 1942 release, but it's nice that both versions are here. YMMV. The film quality was superb, almost too perfect, and Chaplin's pancake makeup was quite obvious, especially in close-ups.

There is a contemporary news show (maybe on FOX?) which has a segment where people read political cartoons using character voices.

The story was inspired by the plight of gold prospectors who set out to make their fortune on gold.  Unfortunately, the dreams they hoped would come into fruition were rarely realized.  In the case of The Prospector (Charlie Chaplin), the challenges he faces are seemingly endless, what's more, he falls in love with a beautiful young lady (Georgia Hale) at a dining hall and his life is never quite the same!

I can't quite articulate why, but the storyline just doesn't seem as tight, perfect, or well-developed as in other of his films.  Perhaps it's just all of the hype that makes me feel it doesn't quite measure up to his other masterpieces.  Perhaps another reason I just don't feel the plot is as tight or as well-developed as it could have been is because of the sudden metamorphosis of Georgia.  One minute she's mocking the Tramp with her friends, and not long afterwards she's sorry for how she's been mean to him and loves him after all?  She also never really seems that apologetic or like a sympathetic character, which leaves a lot to be desired in this subplot of the main story.  I wish there had been more of a believable transition between her mistreatment of Charlie and her eventual repentance and feelings for him.  He liked his leading ladies to be talented as well as beautiful, unlike some other comedians of the era, and I agree that Georgia Hale did show talent in her scenes, but she just didn't come across as fully-developed as other of his leading ladies, such as Paulette Goddard or Claire Bloom.

However, all that said, I still really like this movie, even though I don't like it quite as much as, say, 'Modern Times' or 'Monsieur Verdoux.'  It's a really sweet fun movie regardless.  It is so true that oftentimes there's a thin line between comedy and tragedy, and Chaplin, in his usual genius way, seemlessly interwove the two elements, finding a humorous situation in dark events like the Donner Party and the real-life Gold Rush in Alaska in 1898.  Sometimes we have to laugh during the hard times or we'll go insane, find the comic possibilities in things like being hungry (as in the famous scene of Charlie and Big Jim eating the boot).  He was a master at making the audience laugh and cry at the same time.  There are a lot of great classic scenes in this movie, like the boot-eating  scene, the dance of the rolls, Charlie turning into a giant chicken, and the scene where the Tramp first arrives at the dance hall, that iconic image of the eternal outsider looking in.  Mack Swain, as Big Jim, also puts in a fantastic performance.  He was a truly wonderful character actor, and as he demonstrates here, he was more than capable of playing a supporting role instead of just a smaller character role.

The other part of my reason for giving this a 4-star rating is the fact that the original 1925 film is on the bonus disc.  What was the reasoning behind that one?  The 1942 reissue, with the title cards removed, a number of scenes removed or edited, and Chaplin narrating it in his very British voice, is on the main disc.  At least he was doing this with his own film (the one he wanted most to be remembered for), instead of someone else doing it, but it's still quite distrating.  The reason he never had the Tramp speak was because he knew full well what a universal timeless character that was, and hearing that voice here just proves why a speaking Tramp never would have worked.  His voice works in his sound films because he's playing different characters; here it doesn't because it's with a character that was beyond a voice.  And the action is self-explanatory enough, so it's distracting to have so much of it described for us, as though we can't figure out what's going on or need to have narration over a scene that needs no explanation to follow along with.  The 1925 original is also much longer, and feels more coherent, poignant, and funny, giving us the full story, as it was originally intended.  The ending is also so much nicer in the original.

Overall, it might be a bit overrated, but it's still a very good film.",1158364800,,4053,4.52400548696845
212625,4,6300158772,"This is the first silent film I've ever watched.  It's not for people with ADD, but The Gold Rush is surprisingly well done.  You're able to follow what's going on with only a few subtitle screens placed here and there.  Nothing at all what I expected.  I figured there'd be hundreds of screens I'd have to read.  I was really surprised that the movie worked so well with so little reading.  Exaggerated blocking was probably one thing that made it work.  This technique no doubt eliminated the need for quite a few subtitle screens.  Very smart move on the part of the director.  Of course, exaggrated blocking beats the heck out of no blocking at all.  Some of the more monotone movie stars of today could drastically improve their performances if they apply the blocking techniques used in films like this.

Because there's so little verbal communication, the VAST majority of the comedy here is physical.  But honestly, I'm not very sophistocated when it comes to physical comedy and I've never evolved past the three stooges.  So I'm not sure if I laughed out loud during any scene in this film (although I did enjoy seeing the prospector accidentally tie a dog leash to his belt).  Despite my quiet reaction, I still found the movie to be very charming, much like Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks.

I love the music and the special effects.  Very impressive for the 1920's.  Even though this sucker is old, it certainly doesn't look low-budget.  I did think there were FAR too many scenes in log cabins though.

I also thought the film was quite long.  I'm so used to seeing shorts from the early years of film, that I honestly didn't know if The Gold Rush was a full length film or a short.  I think it was a bit longer than it needed to be, because some scenes in my mind were either not needed or drawn out.  I had to take a few intermissions every now and then - but that may be because I'm not used to the silent stuff.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen a silent film before.  It's quite eye-opening.  Plus the featured girls don't look half bad.",1153612800,,2083,4.505347593582887
212626,5,6300158772,"It's hard to say which Chaplin masterpiece is the *best.* But having just viewed this 1925 release I have to say that right now I would have to give that honor to this film.  Why?  Well, to start with, it is really quite funny.  Just watch Big Jim Mckay's face during the famous *cooked shoe* scene. No straight man has ever played it straighter or funnier. There's the *dog tied to his belt* scene, the *house perched on a cliff* scene, the *chicken suit* scene, all seasoned with Chaplin's small detailed quirks that make repeated watchings rewarding.

Second, the supporting cast is extraordinary, perhaps the best in any other Chaplin film except perhaps A Woman of Paris.  The comedy is shared by Chaplin with these capable folk, and the result is very very funny.  A special nod must go to Georgia Hale, who turns in a great performance as the love interest.  The scene when she comes into Chaplin's empty cabin on New Years Eve, and realizes what she has done to him is a performance for the ages.

The look of the film is very fine.  All the outdoor scenes really do look like they were shot in a blizzard.  The interiors are very detailed and interesting.  I don't think Chaplin paid so much attention to detail as in this film.

Lastly, one must say something about the dramatic elements of this film. Much has been written about Chaplin's sentimentality.  While there is that here, there is also a very faithful rendering of romantic isolation which comes off VERY authentically, very powerfully.  The scene of Chaplin standing in his room, listening to the New Year's Eve bar crowd is exquisitely heart-rending.  Chaplin expresses it all with his still back to the camera.

This DVD edition lost a star for putting the inferior remake on the first disc. I am mainly writing this review to urge Chaplin newcomers, or anyone for that matter, to watch the original 1925 version first. The re-release has highly distracting and tedious narration throughout the entire film, as all the intertitles have been deleted. At times this narration comes across as bad dubbing, as the words are very roughly synced up with characters talking on the screen. Even though Chaplin himself did the narration, the effect is very cheesy and amaturish, and makes the film MUCH more dated, while taking away much of the emotional effect of the original film. I also prefer the slightly longer, more dramatic 1925 edit, and the original ending, which is just perfect. It seems like the 1942 re-release was more of a gimmick and a chance to make an extra buck than a serious artistic endeavor (kind of like the Star Wars ""special editions""). Some would say that at least the re-release had Chaplin's own score. However I think the piano score for the silent version is excellent, despite reviews here to the contrary. First off, the score is based on the original cue sheets, so it is quite authentic to the time. It is played excellently, is well recorded, and is very fitting to the overall mood of the film.",1108944000,17,1447,4.67843137254902

He shacks up with two other grizzly fellows, Black Larsen and Big Jim McKay high up in the mountains.  Friends are scarce, except for a few four-legged, furry ones and so is food.  Thanksgiving fare consists of boiled shoe with a side of shoe strings.  After so many days without food, Big Jim starts hallucinating and sees a gigantic, walking chicken in their cabin without wondering where has 'the little fellow' gone.  Luckily for Charlie, a four legged critter soon walks through the door.  Such is the life of lone prospectors.  'The little fellow' later ventures down into the valley and discovers Georgia, a dance hall girl, in the mining town.

212632,5,6300158772,"I love both versions of this DVD. I taped the 1942 version with narration first on television (TCM). Initially I was repulsed by the narration. Afterall, a silent film is supposed to be silent! When I first discovered that the 1942 version I taped from TCM was with narration, I wouldn't watch it. I ordered this 2 disc set so that I could watch the original version.

While waiting for the DVD to arrive, I watched the 1942 version. After a few moments, I lost my aversion to the narration. Then, there's Chaplin's original score which is wonderful. Whenever you can watch a Chaplin film with his own original soundtrack, you're in for a treat. By the end of the film, I found the narration and soundtrack so charming, I wondered how the original version could top it. In my opinion, the original didn't top the re-release. They're both great!

The original 1925 version on the second disc is more dramatic than the re-release. It comes with the traditional piano score of the day, which doesn't compare to the soundtrack scored by Chaplin for the re-release. Some of the original scene versions are different than some scenes in the re-release. In the re-release he selected some different shots than he did for the original that are more dramatic and poignant in nature.

Hundred and hundred of human beings have played hard with this illusion . But just a few have had the weird privilige to trnsform their lives for this random cause .

Charlot focuses his attention around the myth and the loss of humanity which this seek carries on its requirements .

Obviously this simply tale reminds us to Alberich (Gotterdammenung)who decides to steal the gold of the ring to win power and neglect the love .

But Chaplin goes beyond the human ambitions and thanks to his character , he gets turn the rules of fate , showing a charming person and obviously to get unforgettable and immortal laughable sequences  which belongs to legend status .

212634,5,6300158772,"I agree with the other reviewer who writes that this is indeed one of Chaplin's greatest films. He plays ""The Tramp,"" the role of the Everyman who in this story comes to the Klondike region to find gold during the Gold Rush of 1898. Despite his diminutive stature compared to other stalwart gold miners like ""Big Jim"" and the evil ""Black Larsen,"" Chaplin's character seems just as sturdy for the task in an incredibly harsh winter environment.

At first The Tramp and Big Jim are duped by Black Larsen who is supposed to go out for food when they are all trapped in a cabin seeking shelter from unbearable cold. Black Larsen kills the lawmen after him and takes their food and possessions for himself. Yet good wins over evil-Black Larsen is killed by an avalanche! Big Jim is also a victim of a bad memory after a fight with Larsen. Yet in the end Jim and The Tramp become millionaires after striking gold!

And there's romance, too! The Tramp meets and falls in love with Georgia, a young woman who came to the region to be a show girl at the local tavern. Georgia snubs The Tramp initially but things change for a happy ending-of course!

I recommend this video for Chaplin fans and fans of the silent film era. It is an excellent example of silent film at its best. There is also a second version of the movie which was made in 1942 with Chaplin himself narrating.",1093824000,2,1368,4.464
212635,4,6300158772,"Surprise came to this reviewer when he realized that the main feature on this DVD is the 1942 re-issue version of THE GOLD RUSH (with added music, narration, and sound effects) rather than the 1925 silent original. Fortunately, the silent version is available on the second disc as an extra. Seems like an odd decision to make though; I would have reversed that, as I much prefer the original. For one thing, the title cards are much more lyrically impressive than the rather strained narration. Pictures speak louder than words, and the images Chaplin created on the soundstage simply don't need a voice-over. And the rather drastic cuts (the original film runs 96 minutes, the later clocks in at 69) leave out a lot of good stuff. Still, both versions are included anyway, so I can't complain too loudly.

 I watched a battered old VHS copy of this film many, many times as a child in the 1980s. It was a delight to get this film on DVD, not just for the impressive extras, but to have the picture looking crisper than ever. While I'll admit to preferring the musical score they used on that VHS release, the stunning restoration work more than makes up for it. Jokes that I had missed because of the fuzzy picture were suddenly revealed to me (I had never realized that the building that Chaplin inadvertently covers with snow is the town's jail). And although this has nothing to do with the picture quality (though it does come from seeing scenes that had been cut from my VHS copy) I also never really noticed how awful Georgia is to the tramp. Sure, she's a bit regretful about her pranks, but she never really apologizes or makes up for her behavior. I wonder if that was part of Chaplin's decision to modify the happy ending.

 Watching this film for the first time as a child, I'll admit that it didn't quite live up to all of my expectations. But while I'm not sure that I'd place this as Chaplin's best films, it's still pretty damn good. His comedy is, of course, excellent -- well conceived and extraordinarily executed. Yet his directing is also worthy of mention. I love they way he lets the camera linger. Look at the pan across the faces of the partygoers at the New Years bash inter-cut with the shots of the lonely tramp. It's difficult for a director to accomplish this without being corny, but Chaplin pulls it off successfully.

 THE GOLD RUSH is a film made up of several now-famous set pieces. Most of the sequences are now so ubiquitous that people would recognize them even if they'd never seen a silent film before. The movie's successes are too numerous to mention. The dance of the dinner rolls, the Thanksgiving shoe, the cabin on the edge of the clip. These are all unforgettable scenes that deserve more than to be simply listed in an on-line review; they deserve to be watched by everyone. The ""Chaplin Today - The Gold Rush"" documentary (quite good overall) shows a room full of young school children enjoying this film for the first time.

However, through his kindness he ends up being hurt in several ways.

The sentiment is there but the gags work well and the impression for once is that this is a comedy and not a tragedy with the odd falling over scene.

But no -- in this set, you get two versions, neither of which even came close to satisfying my memory of this film, watching a crappy TV version which nevertheless had the original score intact and no narration.
The two versions here are Chaplin's own retroactive tampering with his film, adding oodles of unnecessary narration which never tells us anything the images don't.  It's strange that Chaplin himself didn't always realize that his was a highly theatrical, demonstrative comic technique of which he is a master, but which holds no element of naturalism whatsoever.  Whenever he departed from the silent-film milieu, he never went too far (with the sole exception of Monsieur Verdoux).  Chaplin's own dialogue technique is ill suited to film, being too magnanimous and self-conscious; when he employs it in a strange silent-film way (as in the singing sequence of Modern Times, or the ""people-talking-gibberish"" gag he uses in his later films) he succeeds grandly.  When he tries to use sound naturalistically as in the narration here, The Great Dictator and Limelight, he tends to fumble.
Having been shell-shocked by the meddled-with version, I had hopes that the second version on Disc 2, billed as ""the original 1925 silent version"", would be better.  Only marginally:  Somehow they felt the need to replace all the titles (yes, the titles matter -- just look at Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo) and, more grievously, redo the score.  And this new recording is even more problematic than the overly clean re-recorded orchestral score to the recent DVD re-release of Metropolis.  The music on this ""1925 version"" sounds so digital that it neatly destroys the feel of the picture.  The piano sounds like it's a MIDI keyboard plugged direct into a computer, without the percussive feel of a real piano, and the resultant sound is so antiseptic that it's anachronistic to the picture.  They should have at least used analog tape to record, to simulate the warmer, older sound that would have accompanied this film both in its day and throughout history.  The musical performance also lacks that ""soul""; it sounds like a series of notes following sheet music, rather than an expressive entity complementing the film.  I don't think they spent nearly enough time drilling the performance and the production on the music here, and it just ruins the picture for me.
I refuse to believe that there isn't a soundtrack to The Gold Rush out there that dispenses with the narration yet includes music that sounds of the same era as the film.  I'd rather hear a third-generation transfer of an old Beta soundtrack from a TV station rather than these two versions:  One unnecessarily tampered with narration, the other a clean, technically flawless, yet soulless imitation of what the music might have been like in 1925.",1059436800,6,2973,4.965725806451613

212651,4,6300158772,"""The Gold Rush"" has been delighting audiences for almost 80 years -- it's one of the flat-out funniest films made in the silent era or any other. This is the movie Chaplin wanted to be remembered for.
Like other films in the Chaplin Collection (at least so far) the ""Gold Rush"" enjoys across-the-board improvements in video and audio, including digital transfers from Chaplin family elements and Dolby Digital 5.1 mixes. Imaginative bonus features inform and entertain without wearing out their welcome.
But this is Chaplin and so there is controversy. Image and Fox Home Entertainment felt the wrath of the faithful a few years back when they released Chaplin's audience-friendly 1942 sound version of the film, ignoring the classic all-silent film.
MK2 and Warner didn't dare blow off the original, but their ""Gold Rush"" package relegates the 96-minute silent to disc 2, as an extra. The 1942 version gets the star treatment, taking up all of disc 1. It runs 69 minutes, as transformed by Chaplin when he recut the film, added narration and recorded an orchestral score.
The 1942 edition will be more accessible to mainstream audiences, but it's a shame that most viewers will bypass the original, probably the grandest silent-movie entertainment of them all. (A new piano track by Neil Brand adds even more zest to the silent.)
The Chaplin Collection's 1942 film looks great, with most of the wear digitally scrubbed out., but some videophiles will stay with Fox's 2001 release, which retains a bit more contrast and detail with the tradeoff of wear. The Warner silent sports a decent restoration job, from Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, but its images tend to be flat and inconsistent, with wear throughout. Warner's two versions are presented full-screen (1.33:1, as Chaplin intended), lacking a bit of picture information found on Fox's widow-boxed film, which runs 72-minutes. And the Warner silent employs some subtly different takes than the updated film.
A half-hour MK2 TV documentary retells the tale of the production, which started in the Sierra Nevada before  retreating to an elaborate set in L.A., where 100 barrels of flour stood in for mountain snow.  The docu points out that Chaplin's humor frequently revolved around hunger, the curse of his childhood. ""The Gold Rush's"" comic tale of starving prospectors was based, in part, on the real-life horrors of the Donner party. The DVD includes rare outtakes of Big Jim the miner chasing his hallucinatory chicken (Chaplin) through the woods.
The Chaplin Collection's next releases, due in early 2004, include ""The Kid,"" ""City Lights,"" ""Monsieur Verdoux"" and ""The Circus."" All but ""Verdoux"" are double-disc sets.",1058400000,6,2678,5.154022988505747
212652,4,6300158772,"The Gold Rush is a silent Charlie Chaplin film from 1925.  The version that I watched on this DVD was a reissue of the film where Chaplin himself adds narration to the film.  Not having seen the unaltered original, I can't make any comparisons to that.  However, for the film that I saw the narration mostly helps the story.  The acting is done well enough that you would know exactly what is happening without any narration (the mark of a good silent film), but the narration does not take anything away from the film and it does not run through every scene.  According to what I've read, the silent version is almost 30 minutes longer, but the 69 minute length of the film I saw was just right for The Gold Rush.  The new DVD in the Chaplin Collection includes both versions.
The story is that the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is a prospector heading to the Yukon Territory during the Gold Rush.  He meets up with two other prospectors and during a storm they get stuck in one cabin.  Here The Tramp cooks his own shoe and he and another man eat the shoe.  The hunger scenes are actually quite funny.  Later on in the film we see Chaplin do the little dance with dinner rolls that is later revisited in the film Benny and Joon.  This is absolutely classic.  The Tramp also falls for a dance hall girl (Georgia Hale) and throughout the film there is a definite air of loneliness.
This is a fun movie and there is something intriguing about watching classic Chaplin films.  Even 80 years later, it is easy to see why Charlie Chaplin was one of the masters of early film and why he is still considered a comic genius.

212665,5,6300158772,"I have seen many Chaplin films and believe that this is one of the very best, if not the best.  It's set in the klondike as Cahpalin sets out to find his fortune in the Gold Rush.  There are absoliteley hilarious scenes in a wooden cabin in the mountains where the starving Chaplin enjoys a fine dinner of roasted boot.  The funny part is not that in itself, but the gentlemanly and elegant way he sets out to eat it, table manners and all. As a result of this and other scenes there are many valuable lessons about life and its full enjoyment in this film.  I also think that the score is Chaplin's best.  It can be enjoyed at almost any age and its lessons are universal.",1007251200,2,673,4.2265625
212666,2,6300158772,"I was really looking forward to getting this, my favorite Chaplin movie, on DVD, but now I think have to get rid of it again, I'm afraid. The picture quality is nice enough for such an old film (hence the 2 stars), but unfortunately this is not the original version but the lame one Chaplin re-released. Here's what's wrong with it: Chaplin un-necessarily narrates the story, the ending is different, the titlecards are removed, or rather, it looks more like the picture was blown-up cropping the sides of the picture !. This is not the movie I love. Somebody apparently thought: ""well, if Charlie himself changed it this must be the director's cut, therefore we'll release this version"". How wrong they were. We want the superior, and longer, original silent version !. Chaplin fans rebel !.",995241600,11,792,4.830882352941177
212667,1,6300158772,"Watching The Gold Rush, I understand why Chaplin had trouble achieving a breakthrough in Britain. The humour in the film is very unsophisticated, at times even ridiculous. Chaplin has had 4 or 5 ideas for 'funny' situations, and has then tried to link them together to a film. A few of the situations are a bit funny, but the film as a whole is not funny at all.",977011200,3,362,4.338235294117647

212670,5,6300158772,"By now, the enormous production problems surrounding The Gold Rush have become the stuff of legend (75 years later!).  And yet, Chaplin edited the film for its theatrical re-release and added a musical score and narration.  What the soundtrack reveals is Chaplin's true tragic flaw as  writer/producer/director.  What he always needed in his later films was a  good producer/editor to recognize what was great in his work and what was  merely playing lip-service to a new medium.  We now know that silent films  were so much more than films without a sound-dimension.  The greatest  silent films had no need at all with music or narration to hold an  imaginative viewer's attention.  The concentration required to make and to  watch a silent film has, of course, been lost to audiences accustomed to  the naturalism - and literalism - of sound films.  This is what worried  Chaplin - that sound film had left him behind and that no one could enjoy  one of his silent masterpieces without attempts to jazz up the material  with music and narration (which, in this film, are often cloying).  Show a  little more respect for silent films, please!",963360000,7,1143,4.884816753926701
212671,4,6300158772,"I cannot agree more with ""A viewer from Dallas, TX"" -- this 1942 version lessens the whole ""Gold Rush"" experience, even though the video quality is astounding. Having just watched ""The Kid"" and  ""City Lights"", I found the commentary on this version most  annoying and distracting from Chaplin's fantastic pantomime. While in the  other films one becomes engrossed in the visual elements, in this version  of the film it is impossible to become fully involved, as the commentary  actually distances you from what is going on. It would be such a grave  mistake if this version would be the only one available for today's  audiences, so I urge and plead: Image, please release the original 1925  version on DVD too, please!",959212800,34,720,4.892561983471074

7803690,3,6300158772,"An annoyance:  I ordered the Multformat and it comes as Blu-Ray only. This seems to be commonplace with Amazon as it has happened to me before with other titles.  That aside, this is such a great classic. The remaster quality is excellent; very crisp and clean, and the sound is great. I appreciated the intact 1925 version as that is the version I saw and fell in love with as a child. One thing I will say, which I'm sure many will disagree with, is that I did not particularly like was the Chaplin 1942 score. I realize he made it specifically for this film (well, the '42 version anyway), and while it is great, for my taste it is far too serious and complicated for the movie. The very first time I saw this film it was on a videotape and had a piano accompaniment that was matched to the film. I have no idea who wrote it, but it was that classic ""silent movie feel,"" which for me is more authentic and really more enjoyable (you can find something very close to it on YouTube if you're interested). I'm not sure how they'd find it or create it, but something like that on a second audio track would have been really cool. During a 1925 screening, you would likely have had something very simple being played live to accompany the film, usually a piano. There wouldn't have been a huge orchestra playing a complex piece. So while people contend that's what Chaplin would have wanted because he wrote it, it's not particularly in line with how the average Joe would have experienced the film. But hey, while I'm the type to appreciate how amazing the remaster looks, I also miss the dust and scratches.",1509667200,2,1607,4.425675675675675
