8380164,1,B002TJ68GA,Totally one sided view. Love in India is love everywhere else in the world. The director took minor aspects of Indian culture and exaggerated them. Don't waste your time.,1386028800,,170,4.896551724137931
8380165,1,B002TJ68GA,"Indian women are beautiful.  In a culture that is based on old and I mean VERY OLD tradition I thought this might be the opportunity of a lifetime to actually see some Americanized or multi-culturally influenced Indian women.
No, not even CLOSE.  If the director had used his girlfriend (who has a very sweet presence about her) throughout the movie/documentary in a much more ""guide"" type role it may have been bareable. As is, you'll probably get more enjoyment taking two plastic spoons and gouging them into your eyes for an hour and a half instead of watching this drivel.",1378252800,2,577,4.76
8380166,3,B002TJ68GA,"I would definitely not advise watching this movie with any children; it has numerous graphic sexual images and at times video clips.
It is an interesting amateur documentary that sheds light on perceptions of sexual activity in India, but it spends a considerable amount of time examining interviews between the person filming it and his friends and girlfriend. The historical and cultural contexts he brings into the documentary are certainly interesting though!",1377129600,2,463,5.444444444444445
8380167,1,B002TJ68GA,"It is long, boring, and pointless. It gets way off-point and you're left wondering what is happening in this film.",1376352000,,114,4.75
8380168,1,B002TJ68GA,not my type of movie..not educational at all..discus sting and degrading. i thought this would show culture ...total opposite of what it was.,1368144000,2,141,5.173913043478261
8380169,3,B002TJ68GA,"The filmmaker Q tries to explore sexuality in India, contrasting the Kama Sutra of the past with the sexual conservatism of today.  It's an interesting enough exploration.  So much of the interviews are in Hindlish, like in many Bollywood films.  I'm not sure how Indian languages are going to survive or stay pure if sooooo much English gets infused into it.  I think the same thing when watching Tagalog filmic productions.

Q's camera work is great.  This is not just some guy recording his surroundings on cheap equipment.  Still, this did seem a bit hodgepodge, or catch-as-catch-can.  The lack of structure may frustrate some viewers.  For example, he records a married couple in a rural, tribal area.  He shows them for two or three minutes, but they never give an interview for the audience to learn something.  I think ""Monsoon"" might have had a scene where a female translator was having problems translating the sounds in a blue movie.  I thought of this when watching the documentary.

There's a good amount of singing in this and I just loved it.  They never mentioned the African-American concept of soul, but I felt the singers were really putting 110% into it.  Then again, there was an old poet here and his words, actions, and images seemed very unerotic or unappealing to me.)

The Kama Sutra is not the only shocking matter here.  This work presents a Krishna and Radha as being a Romeo and Juliet of India.  However, they were both married to other people.  There's even a story told that has Oedipal/Electra parellels but is not condemning of the practice.

This documentary is full of its maker, named Q, and his recordings of his girlfriend.  Q kinda looks like a brown Clive Davis.  Q never shows his whole chest, but you can tell it's nice and hairy in that Alec Baldwin, Patrick Warburton type of way.  At one point, he and his lady friend watch a tape of themselves getting busy.  He shows his butt from the side, but I would have preferred to see his bottom portions directly.

This work is heterocentric, however, it doesn't try to disrespect non-heteros.  At one point, he shows women who say Bollywood actresses turn them on.  Given the prejudiced laws that Britain forced down the throats of the subcontinent, it may not have been safe or allowed to explore same-sex matters with more dedication.  For those interested, I greatly encourage them to see Pratibha Parmar's wonderful documentary ""Khush.""

You may want to see this alongside the film ""Kama Sutra"" from more than a decade ago.",1319932800,5,2520,4.781902552204176
