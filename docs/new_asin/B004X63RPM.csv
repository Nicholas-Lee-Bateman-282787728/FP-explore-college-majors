4492174,3,B004X63RPM,"Probably the least of all Mike Hammer movies, ""My Gun is Quick"" was made just a couple years after Robert Aldrich's dynamic ""Kiss Me Deadly,"" but it remains cheap and flat, looking more like a TV show than a theatrical feature.  It does, however, show a lot of 1950s Los Angeles, including the then-new freeway interchanges, which are well depicted in an otherwise interminable chase sequence.  What isn't particularly well depicted is Mike Hammer.  Unlike Ralph Meeker, who was ultra-cool but still dangerous in ""Kiss Me Deadly,"" Robert Bray, a kind of physical cross between Humphrey Bogart and Gary Cooper whose star never quite rose in the 1950s, makes for a dumb and overwrought Mike Hammer, going from calm to violence in a flash, simply because the script says to.  Worse, he manages to wear a fedora like it's a dunce cap.  The plot, which is almost complex enough for an episode of ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"" involves Hammer tracking down the murderer of a young hooker he uncharacteristically helped in a moment of softness.  Produced independently and featuring almost Ed Wood, Jr.-caliber production values, ""My Gun Is Quick"" hovers very close to self-parody, but is saved by the sequences filmed on location.",1387584000,4,1223,5.0
4492175,4,B004X63RPM,"Okay, I like it.  Bray was very effective as the physically intimidating, smart and cynical street-brawler Hammer character.  Weak points: sound track, some of the dialog.  If the sound track was better, I think this movie would be on the level of 'Kiss Me Deadly'.  A couple lines of dialog seemed to have been thrown in as an afterthought, which detracts from the flow.  The Hammer portrayal remains believable and consistent with 'Kiss Me Deadly'.  The scenes and interaction are good.",1381017600,4,488,4.962962962962963

4492195,4,B004X63RPM,"Fun period, Film Noir MIke Hammer piece with some great old cars, boats and cheap blonds as props.  Filmed on the cheap in LA in Glorious B&W.  Started to laugh at the dated references but got hooked on the Mickey Spillane style dialog.",1473552000,,236,4.465116279069767
4492196,3,B004X63RPM,"But for the British showman Victor Saville (1895-1979) the important 1955 noir KISS ME DEADLY (only incidentally a Spillane adaptation) might never have been made. Saville alternated between producing and directing in his prewar Gaumont phase (the charming Jessie Matthews musicals) and in Hollywood from 1939 capped a chequered career with the notorious Warners flop SILVER CHALICE. Seemingly not to direct again, Saville immediately lucked into the Spillane-Mike Hammer franchise in four 1953-57 projects he ""presented"" or actually directed or produced. (A fifth Saville-Parklane Pictures Inc. production, THE LONG WAIT, also was adapted from Spillane but without the Hammer character.)

The rare original I, THE JURY, with an inadequate Mike Hammer, is worth checking out for John Alton's photography of the Bradbury Building and Franz Waxman's score. Saville followed in 1954 with an unaired Mike Hammer teleplay (Brian Keith starred, and Blake Edwards wrote and directed). KISS ME DEADLY gave us the definitive Hammer in the great Ralph Meeker, and Saville was executive producer on that project, outranking co-producer and director Robert Aldrich. Some of that film's greatness must be credited in part to Saville, who was keenly aware of the cinematic potential of Spillane's pulp output and the iconography of the loose-cannon Hammer gumshoe.

The little series concluded in 1957, with Saville taking production credit and co-directing pseudonymously. MY GUN IS QUICK is spare, minimalist, sunlit noir, economically and shamelessly set in genuine L.A. locales decidedly less upscale than those in KISS ME DEADLY. The overall smoggy seediness is stylistically apt, and Saville goes to pre-gentrification Bunker Hill, the elaborate freeway system and the newly chic marina district for characterful locales, starkly filmed by DP Harry Neumann. The interiors are laughable, flimsy and underdecorated cardboard constructions (intentionally so in Whitney Blake's completely Cubist marina condo)--but Hammer (played here, laconically, by a fine motorcar/motorboat jockey) does his best detecting and clearest thinking outdoors, in the long freeway chase, the boat cruise and a devious scrapyard boobytrap.

Montana-born Robert Bray was Marilyn Monroe's driver in BUS STOP the preceding year and really deserved this starring opportunity, the most convincing Mike Hammer after Meeker. I like his performance a lot, so too a rare feature appearance by Whitney Blake, who has a VERTIGO hairdo and Kim Novak mannerisms in her final interactions with Bray. KISS ME DEADLY is more an Aldrich style showcase and a blinding vision of noir apocalypse than a Mike Hammer film, while MY GUN IS QUICK seems truer to the character and to its creator's pseudonoir pulp methodology. The script and the original story are weak and formulaic, but the characters, their verbal and physical sparring, come vividly alive, allegiant to their period and to Spillane filmed the Saville way. Miraculously, it's as if Mike, Velda and Los Angeles itself have survived (unchanged but recast and shaken) the cataclysmic Big Bang that concluded the Aldrich film.",1470355200,,3135,5.554393305439331
