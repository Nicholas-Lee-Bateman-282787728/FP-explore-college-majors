7798089,4,1573309877,"I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the product and it looked new.

A friend of mine copied this onto a DVD and she skipped Cathy's exercise comments and directly got to the workout.

I, on the other hand, with this VHS have to blindly figure out how much I have to rewind and fast forward to get to the work out section.  That's VHS!

I did get this at a bargain.",1252540800,,369,4.083333333333333
7798090,4,1573309877,"Okay, I'll admit it. The first time I did this tape, I didn't like it.
I'd been doing Kathy's ""Lift Weights to Lose Weights"" for a couple of months and was ready for a change. I thought this video --twice as long as LWTLW-- would be the next step I was looking for. But after doing it, I was unsatisfied. Some of the exercises burned a bit, but I really didn't feel like I'd been challenged. This workout didn't seem much harder than LWTLW, perhaps even easier. I was dismayed.
But I kept at it cause I bought the tape and I was gonna use it, darn it! And after doing it a few more times, something wonderful happened. The slow, deliberate reps that seemed so mild & monotonous initially, became much more effective once I really began concentrating on my form and working to truly ISOLATE each muscle, really ""focus in"" on what part of my body should be doing the work, as Kathy says during the tape. And sure enough, this workout cut new curves & sweeps into my legs, and ya gotta love that, eh?!
I agree, however, with the other reviewers that the tape's editing could be better, cause I really don't need the informative little anatomy lessons & examples of each exercise disrupting the tape's flow the way it does. This would've been better placed at the beginning of the tape, I think. However, it's not such a problem, the segments are very short & I find it's nice to have a little break, shake the body out & get ready for the next exercise.
Also, sometimes you're, say, doing standing leg lifts one minute and then a second later you're supposed to be on the floor for another exercise, which would be impossible w/out the magic of editing. But so what? I keep a remote handy and there's PLENTY of time to hit PAUSE on the remote so you can get where you need to be. And it gives you time to catch your breath or get a drink or put on an ankle weight or whatever.
So here's what I think. If you're new to weights & trying to decide which Kathy Smith tape to start with: RIGHT HERE BABY! This'll give you plenty of instruction that is lacking in LWTLW, and also the slower, more deliberate pace is great for learning to isolate muscles & perfect your form. Then, you can graduate to LWTLW, and cut your workout time in half while still getting a GREAT workout.
On the other hand, if you already did LWTLW, this tape might not be enough. But if you take the time to concentrate on what you're doing and add weights to the excercises when you're able, you can still get a great workout. Not a better workout, mind you, but a different one. Sometimes, though, that's all your body needs to break out of a plateau. Good luck!
PS. I know it's a lower body workout, but man! Whoever shot & edited this video has a butt fetish! So many closeups of people's rears, it's kinda funny the first time you watch it. Enjoy! hehehe",1013126400,16,2825,4.332075471698113
7798091,3,1573309877,"The workout in this video is decent... And I love kathy Smith.... BUT there seems to be alot of wasted time in this workout.  She stops the exercises to do a little anatomy lesson, to show you where the muscle is, blah blah blah.  While these lessons are a nice thing to add, it becomes bothersome to have to go through everytime you do the video.  It would be better to have this at the END or even the begining.  Also, between some exercises the camera just cuts to it. (When Kathy and the others are switching sides, or changing position) The camera doesn't follow the people, so you aren't left with enough time to change position as well.  I also didn't give this a higher rating because it is a little too easy for what is made to seem like an intermediate /advanced workout.  This may just be because I am in good shape...  On the plus side,  the video is well balanced and I did feel it in my buns the next day!  It is a thorough workout for the lower body and will produce results.  I would recommend Kathy's Lift Weights to Lose Weight video instead, as it the time will fly and it is much easier to tailor the workout to meet your needs when you advanced in fitness levels.",997488000,6,1184,4.245535714285714
