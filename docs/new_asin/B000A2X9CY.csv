Watch out for just a small print that says, ""3 digitally remastered DVDs."" These DVDs are in terrible quality. There isn't any widescreen format whatsoever. As a result, I found myself watching movies where the camera only shows the person talking from the neck down; or seeing someone sliced in half due to the cutting off of the camera format; and sometimes they do that weird thing where the camera bounces to one person than quickly bounces back to another person who is talking. I'm telling you people the way these folks put these movies onto DVD is terrible. I'm positive these films weren't as bad on screen as they were on DVD. Sure, they were low budget but it is laughable that even a low budget film would make such poor editing and directing choices. I mean, I'm sure Gunfight at Red Sands was not filmed in orange. Sheesh.

I really should get to talking about the actual movies now but the crappy quality of this DVD pack diminished my viewing experience. All I can say is that these are B-movies, so don't expect grand award-winning material here. But it isn't all bad. Watching Jack Palance as the hilarious Sonny in the ridiculously lovable cheesefest known as It Can Be Done Amigo (the cheesy theme song made my sides split!) was worth my time. As was watching William Shatner play two roles: one, as a laconic cowboy out to kill his twin brother, and the other role has Shatner playing his twin brother, the half-breed Comanche known as White Comanche. If the sight of William Shatner shirtless, wearing some poor face-paint, and talking in the worst fake Native American dialect doesn't make you roll on the floor laughing (Shatner as White Comanche: ""My brother...he acts like white man...me...White Comanche...act like a true Indian) then you seriously need your funny bone checked!

But yeah, the quality is bad, but thankfully I got this for less than seven bucks. I can deal with it. I'm a b-movie fan.",1210291200,5,2144,4.684350132625995
8073365,3,B000A2X9CY,"WESTERNS 10 MOVIE PACK presents a nice cross-section of the numerous public domain cowboy films currently in circulation. Many of the stars you'd expect to find are here, like Lee Van Cleef, Warren Oates, Neville Brand and Chill Wills, but this collection also offers up oaters that feature Sammy Davis Jr., James Caan, Dean Jagger and William Shatner. It's quite an unusual mix and a really nice way to sample the MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT western movie catalog.
