3145460,5,B0015LMPRE,"Another excellent set of workouts with Billy Blanks.  The Amped, however, is a workout based around a special exercise stick.  You can exercise without the stick, but the video suggests an increased fitness experience with it.  With or without the special stick, I truly believe this is a great workout.",1266192000,,303,5.02
3145461,2,B0015LMPRE,"My husband is an avid Billy Blanks fan. He has several of his DVDs (Christmas presents from me!), but this one was disappointing, he said. Too much talk during the exercises and his heart rate doesn't stay elevated. This is more for a beginner in Tae Bo than someone experienced in it.",1264032000,4,285,4.5
3145462,4,B0015LMPRE,"I have several taebo dvds, including the ultimate taebo, cardio circuit 1/2, rockin abs/buns/sculpt express. the 'amped' series is one of my favorites. its moderate-to-intense cardio, and when combined with the amped bar your upper body will be screaming. (i didn't buy his amped bar after reading bad reviews; i bought a 3- and 4- pound weighted bar from a fitness store, they are inexpensive and don't telescope to extend in length). each workout is about the same length of time, but they get progressively more intense. all in all i like these workouts and would recommend them to taebo fans or anyone looking to mix up their cardio routine.",1243123200,4,645,4.872727272727273
3145463,1,B0015LMPRE,"I am very disappointed with all three workouts. with names like ""jump start cardio"" and ""fat burn accelerator"" I expect to get my heart rate up and keep it there--no chance of that here. There is no flow in the movements. Billy makes you do a move super slow like 8 times, then makes you ""amp"" it up, to do it way too fast, for 8 more times. then everyone cheers. then you do the other side. then everyone marches and cheers. then you start a new move.
how are you supposed to get cardio this way? it was annoying because at times I was out of breath, like I feel when I sprint, but it didn't last. Once in a while there was a move that got my heart rate up, but then you stop to march out and cheer and it comes back down. especially since these workouts are SO LONG ti's just a waste of time. I am really sorry that I bought these DVDs. I'm going to donate them to my local public library.",1241913600,7,891,4.01123595505618
3145464,5,B0015LMPRE,"Excellent Workouts! It consists of three workouts. I usually do the first DVD (two workouts) as my 1.5 hours exercise routine and the second DVD (one 55 mins workout) as my 1 hour exercise routine.

Those workouts guarantee every single muscle get exercised!

I could not buy the Amped ""stick"" since International ship is not supported. Still, the workouts without it made me sweaty.",1231286400,9,383,4.96875
3145491,5,B0015LMPRE,I absolutely love these work out dvds. Awesome price for three work outs. Billy Blanks is great at motivating you not to give up,1395014400,,128,4.375
3145492,3,B0015LMPRE,"Love the workout,  didn't know I needed a amped weight with it, that I can't find.  Not necessarily the fault of the seller!",1391990400,,124,4.3478260869565215
3145493,5,B0015LMPRE,"As usual, Billy Blanks did not let people down. The workouts are not extremely crazy, yet they still get the job done. Even not doing it regularly, I've been able to lose 5 lbs",1387065600,,176,4.205882352941177

3145495,5,B0015LMPRE,This is an awesome workout.  Be prepared to be hurting after the first one though!  It works that good.  I would definitely recommend it.,1366848000,2,137,4.625
3145496,1,B0015LMPRE,"This was utterly disappointing.  I've been using the older Tae Bo videos for several years now, but this ""newer"" workout is a complete waste of my time.  It takes 10 minutes before anything meaningful happens, and, like other reviewers stated, there's not enough flow to keep my heart rate up.  It's just a ridiculously easy work out.  The worst part though is how clearly made up on the spot the routine is.  Billy is half way through making up a new exercise when the thunder plays, and he doesn't even hear it at first.  He's getting cues that it is time to do cool down, and he's not even ready for it.  It's like someone called him unexpectedly and asked him to show up at the studio to jam out a quick 40 minute tape and then go home.  I feel totally ripped off.",1341360000,,768,4.284722222222222
3145497,3,B0015LMPRE,"I bought the 3-dvd pack without the amplifier bar, and I did like that the workout instruction demonstrates both.

However, I was a big fan of the original Tae Bo videos and used to play the VHSs and rewind and play them again. The new moves are the same, but there is less of the boxing emphasis I love. The best part about Tae Bo is kicking and punching and I feel like in an attempt to include the amplifier bar they left that by the way-side a bit.

It is a great fat burner and will get your heart rate up, but if you were a fan of the old Tae Bo you may be a bit disappointed. Billy also loses track of time in the first dvd (Fat Burn Accelerator) and abruptly announces the workout portion is over. Even though it doesn't really affect the workout, it still really annoys me.",1325635200,,782,4.104575163398692

3145500,1,B0015LMPRE,"This work out was highly disappointing. It all just felt ""made up"" with no real attention to form or truly beneficial exercises. Billy Blanks should have stuck with Tae Bo as he is clearly not a general fitness expert.",1270512000,,218,4.615384615384615
