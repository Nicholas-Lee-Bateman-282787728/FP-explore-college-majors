4106330,2,B003BI772C,"I had high hopes for this series, but the predominant feeling I have after watching it is disappointment. What a shame, because there are moments that are quite well done, but they tend to get lost in the rat-tat-tat rhythm of the editing, the incessant music which often jars, and lots of ""whooshing"" sound effects. The producers of this series are keenly interested in the possibility of life elsewhere in the Solar System, to the point where some episodes are devoted almost entirely to speculation on the subject, while one wants more time spent on conveying information about what is actually known about the various planets and their characteristics. A good series for children and adolescents; not so satisfying for adults. It does have its moments, though, now and then.",1353369600,4,778,4.992307692307692
4106331,5,B003BI772C,"Very well done synopsis on our planets. Anything from National Geographic is tops for me. And this collection is no exception. Science, very well done, entertaining on many levels. The visuals are exceptional. 2 thumbs up.",1353110400,4,222,5.194444444444445
4106332,5,B003BI772C,"Oh Yea! Fanstatic, This has become one of my best DVD's. It will show just how nice a HDTV can look too!",1304380800,,104,3.772727272727273
4106333,5,B003BI772C,"I have seen many science shows on the planets, but this is one of the best.  Excellent narration, really great computer animation, and easy-to-understand interviews with astronomers who really enjoy their work and area of expertise.  A lot of them are women, which I think is a great inspiration to young girls who want to grow up and study the universe.  A+",1296518400,11,358,4.741935483870968
4106334,5,B003BI772C,This is an excellent trip to the planets as a travelog.  Enjoy the trip as you view our family of planets.  Highly recommended!,1289779200,,127,4.478260869565218
4106335,1,B003BI772C,"When will producers realize that not all humans have only a 2 second attention span?  I looked forward to this title enourmously. I was going to drown in the glorious modern visuals of the planets and their myriad colourfull moons. Instead someone thought they were making an action movie for teenagers, and not a documentary. Machine gun scene changes did not allow the viewer one moment of visual pleasure.  A total frustrating waste of pixels, and a crime. Because when is someone going to finance another (proper) go at the same title now ?",1286928000,39,544,4.776595744680851
4106336,2,B003BI772C,"I own every season of ""The Universe"" on blu-ray, and if you wanted to decide what to get? Go for Season 1 of ""The Universe"" over this. It has its moments, and does look good on blu-ray, but those are the only strong points. It tends to get a little off-target, at times. The aforementioned ""The Universe"" tends to stay much more on topic with relation to the planets, and looks great on blu-ray, also. Skip over this unless you don't own that set on blu-ray.",1281916800,8,458,4.337209302325581
4106337,5,B003BI772C,"I really liked this because it tried to stick to
currently known facts about the Universe. If you have
watched other programs of the same type you know
that sometimes they spend all of the episode guessing
about what you will find on other planets etc...

I also like that they didn't present things in a
negative way. Example; When the Sun explodes in an
estimated 5 billion years the outer planets will lose
all of their mass and all that will remain are the cores
of once giant planets.

When possible I like to deal in known facts not
theories. Anyway, this is just the opinion of one
person. Overall, I found it enjoyable.",1279670400,18,627,4.443478260869565
4106338,2,B003BI772C,"Being a fan of Astronomy, I bought this figuring it would be both educational and entertaining. At times, it was mildly entertaining, but I certainly didn't learn anything new. Some of the interviews were reasonably interesting, but the narration was rather boring and had a ""boilerplate"" feel to it. Actually, the whole series felt that way-like the general script was written, and they just filled in the blanks for each planet. After a while, I found myself fighting to stay awake. I think this is a good disc(s) for children, but not so much for adults.
On my 60"" TV, the graphics were good, but nothing special. Again, at times seemed somewhat generic. This was particularly noticeable if you watched multiple episodes in a row.",1279152000,13,733,4.872
4106339,4,B003BI772C,"This looks truly stunning - you have to watch it on a large screen TV otherwise you won't get the full effect. It's pretty amazing how much detail the special effects team managed to put into the graphics. There were a number of times I sat there and thought ""wow"" :)

Besides that, the programs themselves are quite informative and live up to the title - they act as a good general guide to the planets. Earth is not covered, but that's okay. I guess the producers are assuming you're already familiar with the third rock from the Sun. However, all the others - including Pluto - are included.

My only gripe - and the reason for the 4 stars, as opposed to 5 - is the lack of extras, although, to be fair I didn't expect a whole lot. There are two very short videos about the Sun and Moon - standard def, I think - and neither run more than five minutes long. It would have been nice to see how the graphics were created or to see some other behind-the-scenes stuff but I understand it costs money to produce that.

Anyway, if you want something to show off your Blu-Ray then this is a definite candidate. If you're new to the planets you'll find it  fascinating and informative and even if you're not new to these alien worlds, you'll probably find the effects spellbinding.

Enjoy!",1278115200,32,1284,4.378151260504202
4106350,5,B003BI772C,This was a well done series from National Geographic.  I liked how it was paced.  I liked the simple yet informative commentary.  The views of the planets was stunningly beautiful.  Well done National Geographic!!,1424822400,,213,5.176470588235294

4106354,5,B003BI772C,"We got this for our son who is home-schooled, and the whole family loved the concept that National Geographic used--like a travel channel special, features on each planet that a ""tourist"" would be interested in seeing.  There were a few extras as well:  a guide to Black Holes. My son learned a lot and loved this portion of his Earth Science curriculum.",1400284800,,354,4.693548387096774
4106355,5,B003BI772C,I really love this set of DVDs on the planets!  I learned things I never knew before about both our closest neighbors in the Milky Way and about unmanned missions to every planet.  One of the coolest things about the programs is that they contain actual footage from rovers and robots that actually landed on some of the planets!  Watching these programs restored my sense of wonder at the universe and the possibilities of space travel.  The show is appropriate for all age levels and would be a great resource for educators.  It would be an excellent addition to any library.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about our neighbors in the solar system!,1395100800,,675,4.630252100840337

It was in great condition, and the seller was extremely helpful, answering my questions prior to purchase. Worth the $$, and my nephew, who is turning 7, is now a self taught expert on the planets in our solar system. It opens up a lot of conversation for us, and the desire to get more books and scienc-y videos for him. These videos are easy to understand without being ""idiot"" level, and cover a ton of details.

8393623,4,B003BI772C,"We visit the planets.  Mars is cold, and water exists only as solid ice and water vapor, not as a liquid.  The atmosphere is too thin.  Mercury and Venus are sizzling hot.  The sun in Mercury's sky is enormous.  Venus' clouds are made of sulfuric acid.  Jupiter's clouds are stretched into bands because of the planet's rapid rotation.  There is no surface.  Jupiter is  half a billion miles away.  Saturn is twice as far as Jupiter at a billion miles.  Cloud tops and rings! Uranus and Neptune are called the ""ice giants."" The sun is a point of light from blue Neptune. It is strange because when I was a kid, the planets were little more than lights in the night sky.  Now, they are destinations, places people might actually be going to in the future.",1425254400,,754,4.463235294117647
