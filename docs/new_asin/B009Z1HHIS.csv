8545455,1,B009Z1HHIS,"The story follows three weddings, a preacher, and criminals involved in credit card fraud. You guess if they are or are not related. It reminded me of ""New Year's Eve"" which I didn't like, but was Oscar material compared to this film. You get to watch 5 disjointed stories that are basically boring and not well acted because the dialogue was stiff.

Guide: F-bomb. Implied sex. No nudity.",1434499200,,389,4.720588235294118
8545456,4,B009Z1HHIS,"great surprise as i thought i was seeing a David Koechner comedy & it turned into a thriller with constant twist & turns
Ending was a total surprise",1365292800,2,148,4.321428571428571
8545457,2,B009Z1HHIS,"A new angle on weddings from a new director, ""Wedding Day"" follows multiple storylines weaving from past to present in a single day as different destines all play out at the same time. Alternately dark and joyous, the excellent cast fits smoothly into their roles and interactions, while first rate post production contributes a textured flow building to a surprising climax",1364860800,,374,5.147540983606557

I have seen several earlier incarnations of this film.  The current, creatively edited version is great!  I enjoyed the characters and the challenges they each faced.  I also really liked the unexpected twists and about-face turns that the story provided.  I like being surprised when I watch a movie.  This one surprised me in a very good way.  You should see it!",1363996800,,367,4.73015873015873

8545462,4,B009Z1HHIS,"Could use more story and character development.. clearer views of why revenge was being sought on certain people, etc. But I actually feel that THAT opinion is a compliment, because that means I LIKED your characters, I got invested in a short period of time and desperately wished I knew so much more... and wanted to continue this journey. The end made a statement, as I'm sure it was meant to. But the story made me want to see the aftermath of all of this.
Not a single actor I didn't like, so that's good news :)
I like I like.. can't wait to see more from 4Horsemen!",1360627200,,572,4.305555555555555
