8198308,5,B000R17U8M,"I recommend anyone with a slight interest about condition of widowed women in India to watch this movie. The movie follows the life of three widowed women: Ropa, Deepti, and Mala and how they were ended up in Vrindavan and how the introduction of Priya, an upper class widowed women changed their lives for good forever. The movie does portray some harsh accurate conditions of these women and although, the movie does not cover the issue of widows in the documentary style manner, I was highly pleased. I wish there were more people like Priya (protagonist) of the movie who were genuinely willing to help others. The movie moved me and I am definitely going to be more involved with the issue of widows in India.",1287446400,3,714,4.674603174603175
8198309,1,B000R17U8M,"The product was advertised like new; however, when I received the DVD it was well worn, with scratches and the box was broken.  The DVD was sent in an unpadded envelope so the fact that the box was crushed would be expected by the sellor but not anticipated by a buyer.

I sent an email to the supplier regarding my displeasure but there was no response.

When purchasing on-line I expect the sellor to accurately describe the condition of the item.  It was not accurately described and therefore I would never purchase from this supplier again.",1238630400,,545,4.645833333333333
