1833175,5,B00008AWV8,THIS WAS A GOOD RENDERING OF THE 1940 ENCOUNTER BETWEEN 2 BRITISH AND ONE NEW ZEALAND CRUSERS AND THE GERMAN POCKET BATTLESHIP GRAF SPEE.,1278892800,,137,4.75
1833176,5,B00008AWV8,"For a warship collector to see these ships in there 1950's appearance was exciting. Could not be done as well with models or computer graphics. I saw the film when I was young,and at the time I enjoyed it,but could not fully appreciate it.",1274572800,,239,4.454545454545454
1833177,4,B00008AWV8,"This movie is a very enjoyable re-enactment of one of the last of the old-fashioned types of naval engagements in history. In this type of battle, both sides are essentially groping around in the dark, feeling around for the presence of the enemy and then, in the event of contact which had to be made visually, blasting away at each other, hoping for a hit, and then praying that the enemy can't bring reinforcements before disengaging and slipping away into the vast wilderness in the ocean.
World War II and new technology was quickly bringing an end to that type of warfare. The development of radar, the airplane and the aircraft carrier was making this obsolete.  In 1942, at the Battle of the Coral Sea, a major naval battle was fought without the ships on each side ever coming into visual contact with each other. This was the beginning of the future.

Although one major plus for this film, as compared to others like ""Sink the Bismarck!"" is the use of actual warships rather than models, a major flaw of the film is that it basically only shows the battle from the side of the British.  In fact, the Admiral Graf Spee's commander, Capt Langsdorff, before disappearing for most of the rest of the film, says he is planning to have the ship return home to Germany, whereas, Admiral Harwood, commander of the British Force G which is searching for him guesses that Langsdorff would head for South America where there was heavy maritime traffic of ships taking grain and meat to Britain. Indeed this is what happens but no explanation is given by Langsdorff for the change. We do not see the Germans in the battle, no explanation is given for their decision to head for Montevideo, nor what they expected to happen there. There are silly scenes showing the night-life of Montevideo, but only a little of the maneuvering of the German and British diplomats and agents trying to get the Uruguayan government (which was basically pro-British) to do what they want.

Finally, no mention is made of Capt Langsdorff's suicide. In the beginning of the film we see that his widow is mentioned in the credits as assisting in the preparation of the film, but we really don't get a good idea of what he was like, nor what his attitude was to the Nazi regime, other than that he was an old-fashioned ""officer and gentleman"" of the sea.

In spite of these short-comings, the film is worth watching because this enagement was the first British success in the war and it gave a shot of adrenalin to the British war effort at a time that it badly needed one, and we get a good view of how the old-fashioned Royal Navy operated.",1259366400,,2618,4.609442060085837
1833178,1,B00008AWV8,"It was great to see Bernard Lee in something other then Bond, but this film could have been 30 min. long.

For example, there is lots of pointless exposition showing the transfer of men and equipment from on ship to another. It slows things down way too much, and if it was more directly related to the point of the story, I could understand its inclusion. it's obviously there to pad the movie. But at 2 hours, this film does not need padding. What it needs is a script that can carry the film for 2 hours.

The direction, editing, and script are just substandard.  Even for a 1956 film.  About half way into the movie there is a traditional sea battle (based on a real events) with some very cheesy effects mind you. Then just as the movie is starting to become a bit more exciting,  the plot really thickens and there is the promises of Bernard Lee and a band of captured British sailors escaping from their brig and causing mayhem for the Germans on board the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee as it's being chased and fired on by a closing British task force.  But no!!!! Just as things are about to get very exciting, ALL STOP! We are suddenly in a harbor of a neutral South American nation, and that can only mean one thing. That's right! It's time for a MUSICAL NUMBER. Complete with Carmen Miranda rip off.

Yes, it's now a gay and festive South American musical flavored comedy. With a sudden story focus turning from war battle responsibilities of ships captains, to a wacky girl grabbing (sorry, dame grabbing)  American radio newsman named Mike Fowler.  No more battles or shooting for the next 60 min. But to be fair, you do get an exploding toy model before it all ends.

Now this movie is based on a true event, and the director completely cut out one of the most dramatic elements of the entire incident. That is the fate of the German Captain just four days after the battle.

Oh, and that they thought they could substitute a U.S. Navy Heavy Cruiser (the USS Salem) as the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee was purely ridicules.",1248998400,15,2065,4.494652406417113
1833179,4,B00008AWV8,"This colorful sea chase, which foreshadows the later black and white movie ""Sink the Bismark"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sink-the-Bismarck/dp/B00008AOTR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sink the Bismarck!</a>) offers a mixed if generally succesful collection of ingredients. A retelling of one of the most famous sea battles of the Second World War the film enjoys a huge plus in employing two of the British cruisers used in their fateful 1939 encounter with the German raider, the Graf Spee. In 1956 when the film was made, HSM Achilles had become the Indian cruiser New Dehli, but there she is once again flying British pennants! Watching color footage of the three British cruisers manuvering on the high seas as they reprise their famous roles is great stuff. This is a remarkable coup for the entire directing team, and deserves the highest marks for authenticity!

Unfortunately there was nothing remotely like a German pocket battleship when the film was made, and an American heavy cruiser, the USS Salem, was substituted. To say this looks all wrong is an understatement of epic proportions! Where the Graf Spee had two huge turrets of heavy 11 inch guns, one forward and one aft, the American cruiser movie stand-in has not one, but three turrets forward. The block rectangle superstructure of the American heavy cruiser is so completely different from the German ship's bridge tower as to be laughable.

(When the aforementioned film about the Bismark was produced these problems must have weighed, for instead of using other ships as unlikely stand-ins, for recreating the Bismark - and several of the British capital ships as well - the film makers turned to model makers. This produced some mixed results, but at their best things in the later film are less incongrous - and several scenes, especially the air attacks on the Bismark, are quite sensational film work, mixing live and model shots with great style.)

As The Battle of the River Platte is a Powell/Pressburger film the human side of the conflict receives a good script, though there again are issues. British naval officers all appear to be extremely well-spoken handsome film actors, without a suggestion of the ruddy and weathered red complexions years at sea give to men who have stood long watches in the open air. The savagery of war is depicted, but delicately shorn of most its more graphic horrors. A subplot of British prisoners aboard the Graf Spee offers a middle thematic ground between the two factions, and is handled rather well, but with the exception of the role of the troubled German commander Lungsdorff, there are no deep charater studies, and in the end this is an 'All England' film. Quite unwisely, the suicide of the only complex character in the film is never mentioned, another brutal historical failing. The close instead focuses on a Rule Britannia image of conquering British warships sailing serenely out from the River Platte against a setting sun. (Quite inappropriately so given the chronology of the narrative.)

Well directed as story, this remains a mixed film, with several liabilites and no surprises. The color photography is quite good in places; this is, afterall, the team that gave us Black Narcissus and the Red Shoes. Given the date of the film, the movie treats the Germans far more reasonably than similar American war films of that era or, indeed, than almost all recent American films do.

The highpoint and a dramatic effect well played out throughout the film was the open bridges of the British cruisers, Ajax, Achilles (technically a New Zealand ship, and sistership to Ajax) and Exeter. These made a natural stage set, and are the dominating axis of the movie's drama.

Those of you have DVD players that can play all regions can find this film at a far better price, along with a large number of the best of Powell/Pressburger films in a large inexpensive English DVD set. Once again, I cannot reiterate enough how useful and - in the long run, financially to your advantage - a region free DVD player can be!

Note: The USS Salem, which is seen in the film, was the flagship of the USS 6th fleet during the fifties, and is still around and can be visited at its final berth in Quincy, Massachusetts. It's the only remaining heavy cruiser of the Second World War era ships left.",1232409600,3,4350,5.008298755186722
1833180,5,B00008AWV8,"One of the greatest films of World War II (or its 1939 origin) and based on a historical fact, this great film shows the North and South Atlantic pursuit of the British Navy of one of Germany's fast ""pocket battleships"" ""The Graf Spee"". After doing battle, sinking and damaging more than one British ships and eluding an overwhelming number of pursuing British battleships and cruisers the Graf Spee finds temporary refuge in the harbor of Montevideo, Uruguay in South America, which shortly an due to its then ""new ghest"" faces being surrounded and vitually blockaded by the pursuing British Gunships. Time is running out for the Atlantic naval battles damaged Graf Spee, its captain Hans Langsdorff, brilliantly protrayed by Peter Finch and its crew.
An excellent movie in full technicolor, why hasn't this epic war film been re-edited on U.S. Region One DVD format its beyond my comprehension.
This film based on an important but now virtually forgotten historical and dramatic fact does not deserve to remain partially shelved and denied to U.S. and other DVD Region 1 audiences. To continue to do so is unfair to audiences here. Definitely one of the late Peter Finch's greatest performances and memorable roles.",1223942400,2,1217,5.059701492537314
1833181,4,B00008AWV8,"Definitely a good movie, Battle of the River Plate, brings to the screen the story of the German pocket battleship Graf Spee and its encounter with the HMS Exeter, the HMS Achilles, and the HMS Ajax, off the coast of Uruguay in South America.

The setting is 1939.  German and British naval forces are fighting it out across the world, and for the British finding the Graf Spee could make all the difference between survival and capitulation.

All the actors carry out their performances very well.

The only major setback is that Battle of the River Plate is a 1957 film and compared to modern films, or even epics of the time such as Guns of Navarone and other war movies, falls short of being a masterpiece.

Nevertheless, the film combines drama, action, and adventure, making it highly enjoyable.

The setting, the music and the costumes are all wonderful, though the dialogues could have been better.

History, Intrigue, Duty, and Honor, are all about.

Battle of the River Plate is a movie worth watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History!",1151452800,35,1063,4.770491803278689

1833183,5,B00008AWV8,"This is a fine film based on real events. Late in 1939, a few months after Britain's entry into the war, three small Royal Navy cruisers go after the Graf Spee, a powerful German pocket battleship, in the South Atlantic. The British vessels although savaged by the heavier weight of fire of the Graf Spee ultimately succeed due mainly to good tactics and persistence. The acting is excellent as are the characterizations. British and German naval officers are depicted in a human and balanced way, not always the case with mid-1950s war movies. Chivalry was not dead during this battle and the film makers respectfully acknowledge that.

Some of the battle scenes employing ship models may seem a bit shaky to those viewers accustomed to computer enhanced images. Also, as another reviewer has noted, the use of a U.S. cruiser, replete with national markings, as a stand in for the Graf Spee is a bit of stretch.",1099958400,34,912,4.808917197452229

1833263,5,B00008AWV8,"This is the 1975 well-done restoration of the 1946 original version, Pursuit Of The Graf Spee, which is also available (Region 2). It is available in Blu-Ray (2006) for Region 1.

This is an account of British Naval action in the South Atlantic, December 1939, early in the war with Germany.  Germany had sent their Battleship Graf Spee to the South Atlantic months earlier, in preparation for the war (Sept. 1), to act as a shipping raider on the route to India.  The Graf Spee had been stopping British freighters for some time, taking the crews prisoner, and sinking the ships.  It had also commandeered a British cruise ship (with passengers) for carrying prisoners of war. A disguised freighter (Altmark) re-supplied the Graf Spee with fuel and food.  Because the encounters were sudden, the victims were mostly unable to send distress radio signals.  Consequently it was three months before Britain became aware of the situation.  Britains response was to send three Navy ships to investigate, a Heavy Cruiser (Exeter) and two Cruiser-class ships (Ajax & Achilles), none of them a match for the Graf Spee.

In mid-December the British fleet encountered the Graf Spee, at a distance of several miles, near the coast of South America.  The British commander chose to use the element of surprise and ordered an immediate attack.  All four ships were heavily damaged in the action.  As a result of heavier fire at close range, the Graf Spee eventually suffered a disabling hit (fuel line), broke off the action and escaped toward the neutral port of  Montevideo.  (Consult a map at this point.)  The two lesser damaged British cruisers  followed suit, but the heavily damaged Exeter sailed south to the British Falkland Islands for repair. The above is the essence of the first hour of the two-hour film.

The second hour covers the next three days and features British machinations to delay the Graf Spees departure, pending arrival of more British ships.  Under international law, war ships can enter neutral ports for only a limited time, and can not refit, subject to being impounded.  The British, facing the same restrictions, took the opportunity to visit  the Graf Spee and meet the captain.  The captain of the Graf Spee chose to release his crew, and the prisoners taken aboard, and scuttle the Graf Spee outside the harbor.  Also told is how the American reporter, Mike Fowler, commandeered the only telephone circuit to the USA to broadcast the event, live, for the American radio network.

This latter is the event that concerns me because I remember, as a child of 7 years, hearing that broadcast, Montevideo being in a time zone 1-hour earlier for the East coast.

(Note: The Altmark was captured by the British Navy in February 1940, near Norway, and the prisoners repatriated.  News Reel from that era, along with Winston Churchills speech are available on the internet by searching Graf Spee Sinking, but I have not found the Mike Fowler broadcast.  The American public, remembering their involvement in WW-I, took no sides in the matter. )",1506384000,,3060,4.9412915851272015

Some fine British actors lead the cast of this historic and dramatic naval encounter, which was one of the first major victories for the Royal Navy in World War II. They established a moral dominance over the German battle fleet after this encounter, and Hitler reacted to the loss of Graf Spee very harshly...from then on, he regarded the battle fleet as cowards, no matter what they did. This movie is a fine memorial to the brave sailors on both sides -- including the merchant sailors trapped in the pocket battleship -- who fought and died in the battle.

I expect that if this movie was done today, it would be far less close to the historic encounter. Worse, the British wouldn't be the heroes. Graf Spee would be sunk by an American pilot (James Franco, Shia LaBoeuf) flying an aircraft that would be a cross between an F-22 Raptor and a Star Wars TIE fighter, and his weapons officer/navigator in the back of the plane would be the blonde hottie (Claire Danes, Jennifer Lawrence) who looks great in a bathing suit and can also kick the tar out of a man who harasses her in the beach volleyball game.

The only Britons in the movie would be a smarmy Tom Felton playing the incompetent British admiral who nearly sabotages the whole operation and is actually giving secrets to the Germans and a Marty Feldman-type for comic relief. The German captain would be played by Jurgen Prochnow, and he would discover that his chief engineer is hiding a Jewish family in the engine room to escape the Gestapo, and the two of them would struggle to save the family when the ship goes down, with the captain dying in the efforts.

Critics would hail the movie for its special effects, and as a ""great tribute to the American fighting man and woman of World War II,"" historians would ridicule it for its idiocy, and actual WW2 veterans of both sides would be infuriated by everything about it. Needless to say, the latter would go unheard, and kids watching the movie would believe that F-22 Raptors or X-Wing fighters defeated Darth Hitler in 1942.

This is a story about the pursuit and sinking of the German merchant raider Graf Spee It sank the merchant ships that supplied Great Britain. Survivors were kept on board until they could be transferred to a supply ship. The Graf Spee was disguised to look like an American cruiser (a neutral country at that time). Captured British seamen are kept imprisoned in one big room. One ship was scuttled to deny supplies to the enemy. Three British cruisers are searching for the Graf Spee but are outgunned. They have reports on the location of the Graf Spee. The Fleet Captain estimates where the Graf Spee will be and plans the attack. Three ships will sail towards it while attacking it simultaneously.

A scout biplane is sent aloft. Keep a sharp lookout. Then smoke is seen on the horizon. They order an attack, full speed ahead. They open fire with their guns, the enemy returns fire. The scout airplane reports their shots are falling short. As a last resort they will ram the enemy (sinking both). A shot hits the Exeter, shes out of action. The Graf Spee arrives in Montevideo harbor, their prisoners will be set free in this neutral country. A reporter wants to send a message to New York. Warships are not allowed to rearm in a neutral port. People look at the Graf Spee. Another British warship arrives. The Graf Spee is granted 72 hours to make repairs. But the British want it to be kept longer so reinforcements can arrive.

The British Commodore receives an award. A Naval attach reports on an insecure line that British capital ships will soon arrive. A French merchant ship has left, requiring a 24 hour delay for any enemy warship. What will Langsdorf do? What will the British ships do? The prisoners on the Graf Spee are released. Then the Graf Spee begins to move out, followed by a German merchant ship. It sails to the three-mile limit then halts. There are explosions from the Graf Spee! Well, thats that.

1833383,5,B00008AWV8,"I liked a lot this 1956 British war film, describing quite faithfully the first major naval battle of World War II which took place on 13 December 1939. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS. However, before going into the film itself, if you are interested, here is some basic information about the events which occurred before the battle itself.

1. Pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee and her cruise prior to the battle of River Plate.

Unable to build quickly a navy which could challenge Great Britain and France in an open battle, Hitler decided that Kriegsmarine will mostly rely on submarines, as well as fast torpedo boats and naval mine warfare. As for the major surface combatants, their main purpose was supposed to be the raiding against commercial ships, which could disturb British economy and force Royal Navy to disperse its ships all around the globe, far from European waters. Three units of Deutschland class, the first major surface ships of the reborn Kriegsmarine were therefore designed precisely for raiding and as consequence they were unique, highly original vessels. It was even difficult to classify them, as they didn't fit into any pre-existing category. Germans initially called them simply armored ships (Panzershiff), but they are mostly remembered under their British nickname  pocket battleships.

The idea behind the creation of those powerful ships was a simple formula  they were supposed to be stronger than anything that could catch up with them and faster than anything that could outgun them. Indeed, armed with six 28 cm (11 in) guns in two triple gun turrets, those three ships could defeat any cruiser fast enough to catch them. Their top speed of 28 knots (52 km/h) allowed them also to outrun all British and French battleships.

The only units in Royal Navy and Marine Nationale which at the beginning of the war were simultaneously faster and more powerful than them were the five battle cruisers: three British (HMS Hood, HMS Renown and HMS Repulse) and two French (Dunkerque and Strasbourg). But considering the immensity of oceans, even with those five units in service, finding and successfully engaging a German pocket battleship remained a tall order. On another hand, the absence of any friendly ports in which they could safely proceed to repairs if damaged was the Achilles heel of all German raiders. Exactly as predators in animal world they had to avoid serious wounds when hunting their prey, because each one could force them to interrupt their cruise  and even prove to be fatal if it allowed hunters to catch up with them

In August 1939, anticipating the almost unavoidable war with Great Britain and France, Hitler ordered two of those units, Deutschland and Admiral Graf Spee, as well as their supply ships Westerwald and Altmark, to sail to Atlantic and hide away from navigation lines awaiting further orders. Even after war began the captains of both ships were not immediately ordered to attack  Hitler authorized it only on 26 September, when it became clear that British and French will not negotiate for peace even if their Polish ally was on the ropes.

Deutschland quickly developed engine troubles and she was finally forced to return to Germany in November after sinking only two ships and capturing a third. Things went very differently for her sister ship  commanded by Captain Hans Wilhelm Langsdorff, a highly respected officer, Admiral Graf Spee went on a rampage and caused great grief and concern to British Admiralty.

Her first victim was British cargo s/s Clement, sunk on 30 September. On 5 October another British steamer, Newton Beach, was captured and first used as prison, to keep captured sailors - she was however unable to keep pace with German raider and she was ultimately sunk on 8 October. In the meantime, on 7 October, Admiral Graf Spee caught and sunk another British merchant ship, the Ashlea. On 10 October cargo Huntsman was captured  once again she was temporarily used as a prison ship, before being sunk on 17 October, soon after the captives were transferred to supply ship Altmark. On 22 October s/s Trevanion was sunk, after what the raider went to Indian Ocean. This proved to be a rather poor hunting ground  only one small tanker, the Africa Shell was encountered and sunk on 15 November.

This is the moment, at which the film begins, with Africa Shell burning and sinking and her skipper, Captain Dove, played by Bernard Lee, being brought on board of Admiral Graf Spee. If you don't know yet the real story, my sincere advice is to NOT research it and discover it by watching this very good war film...

WARNING! QUASI SPOILER ALERT! This is NOT said in the film, but it is worth knowing that on 19 December 1939, six days after the battle, Captain Langsdorff killed himself. Even if he served an evil totalitarian regime and his master was a beast from hell, he himself was not only an officer but also a gentleman, a real one, who always treated fairly and humanly defenceless British prisoners. For that reason even some Royal Navy officers came to pay him last tribute.

2. The warships which appear in this film

In order to make this film it was necessary to use no less than five large warships, to act as Admiral Graf Spee, HMS Exeter, HMS Ajax, HMNZS Achilles and HMS Cumberland. It was relatively easy with the latter two, as they both still existed and were operational in 1956. HMNZS Achilles was sold to India in 1948 and was still serving as INS Delhi  Indians graciously agreed for her participation in this film. HMS Cumberland was still in service in 1956, albeit she was then an auxiliary ship and for that reason deprived of her artillery turrets. The short scene in which she appears, so completely defanged and defenseless, actually is a little bit sad... For second appearance of HMS Cumberland in the film she was replaced by HMS Jamaica, a ship which was still in full possession of her means...

For a variety of reasons other three ships didn't exist anymore in 1956 and had to be played by other units - which of course looked differently from those which really participated in the battle.

HMS Ajax was played by HMS Sheffield, a ship larger and more powerful, but whose general silhouette was at least to some extent similar  they both had four turrets with 6inch guns, even if HMS Ajax had two gun turrets and HMS Sheffield three gun turrets.

Heavy cruiser HMS Exeter was played by light cruiser HMS Jamaica, a ship of roughly similar size, but with a very different silhouette (four turrets instead of three). However the general impression of power given by HMS Jamaica made her in a very plausible heavy cruiser.

It was also fitting to give to both HMS Sheffield and HMS Jamaica this opportunity to play in this film, as they both greatly deserved this honor, if only for they last minute life saving intervention against Admiral Hipper and her screen of destroyers during the battle of Barents Sea (31 December 1942). HMS Jamaica also participated actively in the battle of North Cape (26 December 1943) and was charged to give coup de grace to deadly wounded Scharnhorst. Later she also participated with distinction in Korean War, including the crucially important Inchon landing. HMS Sheffield, after fighting in Mediterranean, taking part in hunt for Bismarck and sinking a German destroyer in the battle of Barents Sea battle also participated in North Cape battle.

In order to play Admiral Graf Spee it was necessary to find a fully operational ship more powerful than anything Royal Navy had in 1956. Americans were contacted and US Navy volunteered to contribute one of her heavy cruisers, USS Salem. Commissioned in May 1949, she was in fact the last heavy cruiser ever build and in fact she was even somehow larger than ""Admiral Graf Spee"". Her aspect was also different, as she had three turrets instead of two. However, considering her speed, her powerful weaponry, the predatory aggressive beauty of her general aspect and finally the fact that she was still quite new (""Admiral Graf Spee"" herself was barely three years old on the day of the battle), USS ""Salem was probably the best possible choice. The success of most films relies more on the villains than on heroes  and here ""Admiral Graf Spee"" is shown as a terrifying hunter: fast, powerful and filled with deadly menace. The three British ships are certainly shown as dangerous as panthers - but their opponent is the lion of this naval savannah

Large fleet oiler RFA ""Olna"" was used to play ""Altmark""  the scene of her rendezvous with ""Admiral Graf Spee"", albeit short, is a highly interesting one. Finally, cruiser HMS ""Birmingham"" was used for some shots of artillery fire and scenes which are supposed to happen under the decks of ""Admiral Graf Spee"", as Americans were NOT thrilled at the idea of huge crowd of civilians (actors and film crew), rampaging through the interior of their mighty ship, filled with highly classified electronics

3. The cast

Two most important characters are of course Captain Langsdorff and his cunning British opponent, Commodore Henry Harwood. The first is played splendidly by Peter Finch, who with this film achieved a major break and later appeared in leading or major roles in ""A town like Alice"", ""The nun's story"", ""The flight of the phoenix"" or ""The red tent"". He looks very differently than real Captain Langsdorff, but it was made on purpose  indeed the director couldn't resist the temptation and he gave to this character the beard and moustache which made him look like one of those Spanish hidalgos, whom Elizabethan sea dogs mercilessly fought and frequently outfoxed)))

Although he appears late in the film, Commodore Henry Harwood, played by Anthony Quayle, completely dominates all the scenes in which he appears. For him too it was a big step forward in his career  soon would come major roles in ""Ice cold in Alex"", ""Guns of Navarone"", ""HMS Defiant"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"".

Bernard Lee who plays Captain Dove, the skipper of unfortunate ""Africa Shell"", was at that time already a well-known veteran actor  but of course his most famous role, ""M"" from James Bond movies, was still to come The character of Captain Dove is quite important in this film and in fact part of the scenario was based on his own memories published after war under the title I was prisoner on Admiral Graf Spee.

At that time John Gregson, who plays Captain Bell from HMS ""Exeter"" was considered as the greatest star from all those who appear in the film, but today he is less remembered than previous three actors. Patrick Mcnee and Christopher Lee also appear in smaller roles  the latter plays somebody very different from his usual characters)))

4. The film

The two hours of the film are well filled with a mixture of tension, drama, fighting but also some humour  and the mix was well done. The budget and the means devoted to this project were considerable, but of course couldn't match Hollywood super-productions  still the result of all this effort on the screen is very, very pleasant indeed. Producers were greatly encouraged by the public  when the work on the film began, the association of veterans of HMS Ajax send them a message: We hope your shooting will be as successful as ours...)))

The result is a VERY GOOD war film, which I watched with mouth wide open as a kid on a small black and white TV during my childhood in communist Poland and recently I was glad to see that it didn't age AT ALL and is still a great viewing, even for the total military history freaks (guilty as charged) who know most of the details of the true story.

1833513,4,B00008AWV8,"THE BATTLE OF THE RIVER PLATE, a docu-drama on the sinking of the German pocket battleship Graf Spee, represents an interesting marriage of talents.  One the one hand the film is written and directed by the Powell-Pressburger team, a fact that ensures that its quality is lifted above the run-of-the-mill war films of the period.  Whereas films such as REACH FOR THE SKY (also 1956) focused on notions of British heroism under overwhelming odds, THE BATTLE OF THE RIVER PLATE looks at the experiences of those involved in conflict at sea, whether British or German.  On the other hand the cast contains just about every leading male actor of the period - a prime example of the Rank Organization's doomed attempt to replicate the star-laden productions popular in Hollywood at that time. Sometimes the experience of watching the film becomes an exercise in actor-recognition: Peter Finch, Anthony Quayle, John Gregson and Ian Hunter all have leading roles, supported by stalwart character actors such as Bernard Lee, Michael Goodliffe and David Farrar (as the narrator), with John le Mesurier turning up in a cameo role.  Nonetheless THE BATTLE OF THE RIVER PLATE is worth watching, not least because of its balanced treatment of both sides involved in the conflict.  We learn a lot about Captain Langdsorff's (Finch's( qualities at the helm of the Graf Spee; he is not only an adept sailor, but he knows how to treat British prisoners-of-war fairly.  His character seems more sympathetic as compared with (say) Quayle's more bluff British Commodore Harwood.  In terms of special effects the battle-sequences seem a little primitive as compared to today's epics, but the characterization and plotting remain as sharp and incisive as in other Powell/Pressburger movies.",1386979200,,1768,5.160839160839161

1833517,5,B00008AWV8,"Glad to see a British classic from the 1950's restored and digitally remastered. The image and sound is clean and crisp.

My father was a sailor aboard the HMS Achilles in 1939. She left the South Pacific at the end of August 1939 with orders to show herself in South American waters; partly to protect British shipping; partly to make sure that German merchant ships reported her presence; partly to act as goodwill ambassadors with the various South American nations they would visit.

Their first port of call was Valparaiso, Chile and over the next six weeks they visited sixteen ports along the South American west coast from Buenaventura, Colombia in the north to Puerto Montt, Chile in the south. Rounding the Horn of South America the Achilles called in at the Falkland Islands before sailing to Rio del Plata to join Commodore Harwood's Force G task force. The Achilles then went on to patrol the east coast of South America from Brazil down to Argentina making many ports of call.

My father always told me as a boy that he was impressed with many of the South American cities they called on. When he visited them in 1939 he described them as modern, clean and beautiful. In many respects they were even model cities of the time. It was certainly everything a young man in his 20's from New Zealand who had joined the Royal Navy to see the world wanted. (HMS Achilles would not become HMNZS Achilles until 1941 when the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy became the Royal New Zealand Navy).

He was aboard the Achilles when they went up against the Graf Spee (I have my father's military records which confirm this fact) but it was the beauty of the cities and the friendliness of the people that he spoke of. Even the German sailors they encountered were friendly and respectful.

This movie was one of the first inklings I had as a child that my father had seen battle during WWII and been part of something that had made a world-wide impact at the time. Even now, some 74-years later, scholars are still writing books about it. I'm grateful to the movie for preserving colour footage of the cruiser my father served on during 1939-41.

Found this bit of trivia with an NZ connection on the movie from the IMDB website notable: ""filming started on 13 December 1955, the 16th anniversary of the battle. The River Plate Association in Auckland sent a good-luck message to the crew. ""Congratulations on choice of day. Hope your shooting will be as successful as ours!"".""

Having just re-watched the movie last night I noticed an error in the sequence of events during the battle. The movie shows Ajax opening fire before Achilles. This is incorrect. The actual order of events during initial exchange of fire is: Graf Spee sighted at 6:14am. Graf Spee opens fire at 6:18am. Exeter replies at 6:20am. Achilles opens fire at 6:21am. A full two minutes later at 6:23am Ajax get off their first salvo.

As the son of a member of Achilles' gun crews I feel I would be remiss if I did not point out this divergence from the actual facts of history. :)

For those with either family or close connections to the crew of the HMS Achilles or those otherwise interested in this action I have posted a crew list of the Achilles from December 1939 that I inherited from my father. The HMS Ajax and River Plate Veteran's Association have very kindly made it available from their website here :

1833616,1,B00008AWV8,"This is a great subject but a pretty awful movie.  Ham-handed acting, terrible comedic interjections (who needs comedy in a movie like this?), and silly bridge sets where the actors are mostly oblivious to near-hits in the sea just behind them.  But worst of all, there was no attempt to disguise the USS Salem heavy cruiser, which stood in for the Graf Spee.  The two ships actually bore some resemblace, but c'mon guys, couldn't you at least paint out the Salem's prominent 139 bow number for the movie, rather than lamely suggesting that it was a ""disgise""?  A disguise for a US ship that wasn't commissioned until 1949?!  The Graf Spee certainly did not wear a large bow number as she prowled the Atlantic.  Overall rating: pretty much a waste of time unless you don't konw the story; they should have done a better job when they had the ships around.",1337472000,2,855,4.629139072847682

true events (most of it anyway). For the US version it was called Pursuit of the
Graf Spee as I remember. I managed to tape it off of Cinemax back in the 80's
but later on wanted a dvd copy instead...so waited and waited. Finally came
available and plunked down the money for a copy. Peter Finch is excellant as
the German Captain. Battle scenes were decent and bonus feature included with it
and there is talk of actually raising her from the mud. Some guns have been salavaged.

1833619,1,B00008AWV8,"This was my favorite battle from the history of World War Two and i couldn't wait to watch this as soon as it was ordered, but as early as it started i began to have doubts of it's quality representation of historical facts. I noticed many flaws in it's use of models to represent the ships involved, also the wrong ship was pictured sometimes. What bothered me the most was the inclusion of a ""dramatic plot-line"" which had nothing to do with the Battle of the River Plate, and instead omited historical facts from the film (for example when the Captain of the Graf Spee commited suicide at the end, which was never covered in this film.)",1332201600,3,639,4.47008547008547
1833620,5,B00008AWV8,"Outstanding video quality, better than restored videos of this era. The Graf Spee was represented by a US heavy cruiser, CG 139. The clipper bow was never used on a German ship, but the story line has the Germans on the ship trying to make the ship look like a US cruiser. Very plausable, the German pocket battlship would need only a couple of minutes confusion to cause damage.

British cruisers were actual ships, so action sequances were as close as the actual battle as possible. The director left out any sex stories, all the better, although  there is one singer who was stunning.

Story also did not show German Captain committing sucicide.

If you like naval battles this is pretty good, up there with Sink the Bismark.",1314057600,,728,4.6640625
1833631,4,B00008AWV8,"I like this film. As Uruguayan, I've heard of this battle since I was a kid, and I expected this film with great interest in 1957, when I saw it for the first time. I was 15 then, and I was a great fan of british films, specially war films like MALTA STORY, ABOVE US THE WAVES and THE CRUEL SEA. The film was accurate in some details, like the presence of our Foreign Affairs Minister Alberto Guani, and the British Ambassador Sir Eugene Millington Drake. Some scenes filmed in Montevideo (in 1956) failed showing a modern city far away from the 1939 real one, but the worst of all (and I always wished that the scene were cut from the footage) was a tropical bar called Manolo's (and Manolo was no other that Christopher Lee with spanish accent) that could never exist in Montevideo in 1939 and never before or after. The producers, trying to put some local color, invented a place (which includes a drunken and ridiculous gaucho) more typical than Cuba or the Caribbean islands than the European and culturous Montevideo. Wrong and hateful, but now, over 50 years after, I can take it with humor, forget the outrageous vignette and enjoy the rest, with Peter Finch as Langsdorff, Anthony Quayle as Admiral Harwood and many others good british actors including the old and lovable Bernard Lee, in (for me at least) an unforgettable scene when a German Officer of the Graf Spee informs the British prisoners that the war is over for them, since they've arrived in the neutral port of Montevideo. Lee shows an enormous relief, opens the door to the deck and see the silouette of Montevideo at dawn. Then we can see colorful takes of the city at night, with several places that don't exist anymore but remain in the film in glorious Technicolor and VistaVision. Since Uruguay doesn't use to appear in big movie productions, this one was an exception by that time. I still look at it with nostalgia and affection.",1312156800,5,1910,4.620588235294117

1833634,5,B00008AWV8,"This film is truly one of the best WWII naval films ever made, in my opinion. Fine acting, great actions shots, solid directing and editing, and a clear, straight forward story all combine to make superb film.

Others here have provided the synopsis of this film, so I will forgo the pleasure. While certain parts of the film did not actually occur, for example, the meeting of the British Captains, they were obviously added to tell the story in a clear, efficient, and unambiguous way. One part this is 100% accurate is the see-sawing the British did with their position on the Graf Spee leaving harbor. And unlike many naval engagements, this battle actually did take place in good weather, with fairly calm seas, as depicted in the film.

Unlike many war movies, like Saving Private Ryan, this movie could not be made today anywhere near as well as it was in 1956. The reason-the real stars of the film, the ships, simply don't exist anymore. There are only two WWII light cruisers left in the world, the HMS Belfast in London, and the USS Little Rock in Buffalo, and only one heavy cruiser, the USS Salem (which played the Graf Spee in the film), in Massachusetts, and none of them are sea worthy. The HMS Achilles, which fought in the battle, and the HMS Cumberland who arrived soon after the battle to be a backup, even plays themselves! No other naval film that I know of can make that claim. Models and even the best CG simply cannot provide the realism that the real thing provides, thus this movie could not be made today.

Scenes shot in places like gun turrets, inside gun directors, on the bridge (British naval vessels still had open air bridges at this time), shots of medium/large caliber naval guns going off, etc. can never be filmed again, as they simply don't exist and never will again. Thus, any student of naval history or WWII history needs to see this film.

The other unique thing about this film and time is that radar was not quite available on ships yet. A year later, when the Bismarck sailed, some of the British cruisers had radar.

The only thing that should have been done in the film to improve it was to show a chart of the mouth of the river Plate. Several rivers flow into the estuary, which is quite large. Montevideo is a port city on the Northern coast near the mouth of the estuary, in Uruguay, while Buenos Aires in Argentina (a country friendly to Germany) is almost 100 miles inland, near where the rivers join. Knowing this makes seeing the British problem of catching the Graf Spee if she tried to escape upriver or out into the ocean much clearer.

One of my favorite WWII naval films, one I was thrilled to be able to buy and watch again. Highly, highly recommended.",1305763200,27,2716,4.543967280163599

1833637,4,B00008AWV8,"This isn't a review of the film 'The Battle Of The River Plate,' it's a review of the recently released US market DVD of the movie.

The DVD bears a fine digital transfer of a nicely cleaned-up, restored, color-corrected VistAVision widescreen print (a 1983 print, I think) of 'The Battle Of The River Plate'; the transfer's only shortcomings are minor - two short moments at which the soundtrack of score and dialogue slurs noticeably.

The DVD lacks subtitle tracks both in other tongues and in English (some of the fast-spoken British English dialogue is likely to be lost to American and other non-British anglophone viewers). The lone special feature is a 22-minute disappointingly lackluster production in which vague generalities are spoken, by individuals not identified by chyron subtitle (though viewers of my age should instantly recognize Christopher Lee who, by the way, provides here the only anecdote from the film's shooting), of Powell-Pressburger films and of this DVD's title subject, and most of the footage in this afterthought of a feature consists of scenes lifted directly from the restored film that was the main reason I - and perhaps also you - bought the disc to enjoy. It would have been preferable if some discussion of scriptwriting, production planning, casting, location shoots and technology were included in such a feature on a DVD of a cinema classic. Moreover, the audio volume on the 22-minute special feature is quite needlessly, shall we say, irregular - it's all over the place as it switches between scenes from the film and latter-day commentary by those unidentified individuals, so your remote's VOLUME button's going to get a workout.

For the film itself, then, four stars because, with understanding nods to its period use of rear-screen projection and bathtub special effects, it does a fine job of depicting a classic sea battle, one of the last sea battles fought visually -before the introduction of shipboard radar - and solely with warships' main gun armament. For the restored digitized print on the DVD, five stars for a lovely restoration job well done. For the DVD, owing to its lack of subtitle tracks and its lone, poor, rather slapdash afterthought of a 22-minute special feature, two and a half stars.",1294790400,8,2263,5.061662198391421

Now I have purchased it on DVD and I can highly recommend this version.  It is uncut, letterboxed and the color hasn't looked this good since I first saw the film in 1956. And for me this film just gets better with time.  An excellent cast giving great performances, great direction and camerawork and an attention to detail almost unmatched by any other war film.  The use of actual warships instead of miniatures was also a huge plus.  And while the action moves on to the land after the battle, the suspense never lets up, with the diplomatic wrangling every bit as interesting as the battle itself.  About the only thing missing was Captain Langsdorf's suicide three days after the scuttling, but I think the producers were wise to omit this and allowed the film to end on an upbeat note.  An excellent film about one of the last classic surface actions we shall ever see.

The early part of the movie, the action is on the German ship (with English sailors as captives on the German ship.) and very superficial. When battle starts, actions are entirely on the British ships (in fact on only one ship).. The sea battle between the German ship and three British ships are just so poorly directed.
