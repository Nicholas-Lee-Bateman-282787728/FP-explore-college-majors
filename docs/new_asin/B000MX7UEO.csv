2751000,3,B000MX7UEO,"While I don't think this is the greatest film done on the life of Diana, The Princess of Wales; I still enjoyed it. There really isn't anything new in this one except what they added about her romance with Dodi Fayed.  If you just like to collect things on the Princess then this is one you want to add to your collection. I think the actress who played Diana did an above average job.",1192579200,4,385,4.202702702702703

8173383,1,B000MX7UEO,"Properly, properly s***.
""Diana's"" prosthetic nose is awful.
The actress playing Mother Teresa is white.
In one scene set in a gym there are 2 people on running machines in the background that are obviously not on so the 2 extras are just walking on the spot. Was there not enough in the budget for them to be switched on???
It's almost in the ""so bad it's good"" category. But not quite.",1428796800,,387,4.388888888888889

8173385,4,B000MX7UEO,"I thought that the cast did a fine job.  It was a sad series of events that killed Princess Diana.  I will never forget where I was when my husband phoned to tell me the news of what happened to Princess Diana that tragic night.  She was such a special person to so many people, especially her sons.  She worked to give her life meaning to so many charities and the less fortunate.  If only more of us could and would do that?  The film is a good portrayal of Diana's last years of happiness.  I only wish she could have found eternal happiness in this life with Dodi or whomever was meant to be.",1362787200,2,596,4.130434782608695
8173386,5,B000MX7UEO,like all i loved princess diana and this is as acurate as can be wonderful movie i definetly recommend you get this it is not to be missed plus wonderfully packaged thanks a lot,1351296000,,177,4.235294117647059
8173387,4,B000MX7UEO,"This movie was more enjoyable than I thought it would be.  Amy Seccombe does a reasonable job as Princess Diana, as does the man who played Dodi.  This movie takes us through Diana's last days - at times you can feel her pain and during the landmine scenes you can see her determination to do something about this dreadful problem - Diana cared, that came across. You find yourself wishing you could change the ending - if you cared about Princess Diana I recomend you purchase this video.  I got my copy from Amazon, it arrived quickly and in excellent condition - the picture and sound are of good quality.",1294963200,2,608,4.509090909090909
8173388,5,B000MX7UEO,"Fantastic film! Highly recommended! Note: It was a made for tv movie and embellished some, on the actual events....however, based on all that I've read and watched in the media with regard to Diana's life the final year or so of her life, this is pretty accurate. The actors who portray Dodi and Diana look very much like Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed (both in physical characteristics and subtle mannerisms/facial expressions,stance, etc)

If you are a major fan of Princess Diana, and would enjoy a sneak peak of how her life played out that final year from 1996 to 1997,  it's definitely worth a viewing!!

Enjoy.",1268352000,,619,4.766355140186916
8173389,5,B000MX7UEO,"While some people will say that ""she cries in every scene"" or ""the actors were awful,"" they are not BAD! For one thing, the actors look similar to the real people whom they portray...of course, no woman, no matter how beautiful could ever look EXACTLY like Diana, its like Jennifer Lopez playing Selena. In some scenes however, Amy does look almost exactly like Diana, either because of the hair style, clothing or combination of both. Diana cried a lot in real life as the movie portrays because she was a suffering woman. Amy does however look more like Diana then the previous British movie made of her in 1992 called ""Diana: Her true story."" Not only that, but the accent and personality are much more accurate. If you really like Diana and everything about her, this movie is not that bad. Obviously, it is NOT a Hollywood film, but the final year of Diana's life are very accurately portrayed; from her divorce, to her public role as the ""People's Princess,"" the harrassement by the media, the banning of landmines, the famous metting with Mother Teresa, and finally the romance which blossomed with millionaire playboy Dodi Al Fayed. There is also of course, the wonderful relationship Diana had with her two boys William and Harry. It is a very powerful film but the end is of course heartbreaking!
 PS There is talk in Hollywood to make the first ever American movie about Diana, supposedly Pirates of the Carribnean actress Keira Knightly is up for the roll, but so far there is no further update.",1200614400,8,1507,4.730038022813688
