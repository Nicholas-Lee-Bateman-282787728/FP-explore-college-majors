6717114,5,B00O55UAQK,"At first I thought that Grantchester was a Protestant knockoff of Father Brown, but it really isn't.  It does not have the same kind of humor, and there is a potential for a romantic non-celibate  life for the extremely handsome vicar.  Also, Robson Green as the police inspector is a definite draw.  I enjoy Father Brown and enjoy Grantchester also although in a different way.  I am looking forward to future episodes of this new series.",1422403200,6,439,4.723684210526316
6717115,5,B00O55UAQK,"I am always a huge fan of ""Masterpiece Mystery"".  I stumbled upon ""Grantchester"" by chance as I was checking for PBS shows coming on now or near future.  I was so pleased to find, the vicar, Sydney and his commitment to God, country and helping to find those who are murderers.  I am sure he still has time to serve his congregation as well as family and friends. Sydney is like an onion.  I never read the books which this series was based on, so I know little of his background, except he served as a soldier in the war, has a sister, a girl who he once loved and probably still does  but she is going to marry another man. Layers of his past are revealed in each episode.  Sydney drinks too much but that is how he deals with the war and  what  changed him during that time, to help him to decide to turn to God and serve Him .  All of the stories are well written and play out in the beautiful English countryside.  I watch just to look at James Norton.  He is  handsome, serious and the kind of man I love to see on television.  I am a widow with many grandchildren and many cats so Mr. Norton need not worry that he is the only reason I watch each episode.  It is a good show.  I hope more  episodes  are in production as I write this.",1422316800,22,1241,4.041152263374485
6717116,4,B00O55UAQK,Where is Episode 2? I bought season pass and only have one episode. Episode 2 that aired on PBS 1/25 was available on iTunes yesterday (1/26).  What's up? Love the show and want to see it in a timely fashion.,1422316800,21,208,4.2
6717117,5,B00O55UAQK,I absolutely love this new series. It is helping to ease my craving for Inspector Lewis. Thanks to Masterpiece for giving us another quirky historical mystery series.,1422144000,5,166,5.185185185185185
6717118,4,B00O55UAQK,"This is the first series, which aired last fall on ITV in the UK and has just started on PBS. There are 6 episodes.

I'm giving this one 4 stars, but only because there's only been one episode so far to review an it needs room to grow the character development a bit.

The murder mystery element is the traditional style of whodunit. You're dropped right in to early 50's small-town England, and all the sets are flawless, which is what we've come to expect. Post-war Britain was a lot more austere than what we see here, but the characters do seem to be realistic, rather than corny caricatures. Our hero is a vicar/reluctant detective, played by the handsome and able James Norton, with enough vices to keep him interesting.  He forms an easy friendship with the police inspector, played by the ever dependable Robson Green, who seems at first to be quite hard-boiled but we soon see is a rather cheerful family man.

It appears to be a worthwhile addition to the crowded field that this genre has become, but just different enough to set itself apart, which makes it definitely worth watching.",1421712000,11,1096,4.634020618556701
6717119,5,B00O55UAQK,"Enjoyed this very much. Interesting, good characterizations. Peaceful (for a murder mystery). I look forward to many more. We could all use some stress-reduction instead of what we usually get on TV.",1421625600,5,199,5.25

6717121,3,B00O55UAQK,"Having read one of the Sydney Chamber's novels a few years back, I must confess to being somewhat disappointed in the televised series, which, with each ensuing episode, is rapidly spiraling into a more uninspired - and uninspiring - mystery featuring an Anglican priest who is fairly adept at solving crime, as was the character from the novel, yet unlike his fictionalized counterpart, the series leaves much to be desired in the portrayal of this drinking, smoking, spiritually apathetic priest.

Changes have also been effectuated to the script that irreparably distorted the original mysteries, making them dull and contrived, while also adding elements of crassness here and there which are nonexistent in the book.

Based on its own merits, Granchester does have potential. While the storyline lacked originality, and plodded along too predictably, the characters of Chambers and Inspector Keating are the only noteworthy aspects to emerge from the hash that was made of it. This is one instance where the adaptation did not simply lose the flavor of the books - it simply lost all flavor whatsoever, however, James Norton and Robson Green do their absolute finest with the rather prosaic material. I am willing to continue watching in the hope for improvements, but those changes will need to be profound if Granchester is to be salvaged.",1421539200,21,1346,5.169724770642202
6717122,5,B00O55UAQK,"When gruff Detective Inspector Geordie Keating (Robson Green) first encounters Anglican vicar, and WWII vet, Sidney Chambers (James  Norton) he is annoyed.  The good vicar thinks D.I. Keating's recent closed case suicide might really be a murder.  After bonding over backgammon, D.I. Keating comes to realize the vicar's warm and sympathetic manner coaxes secrets from witnesses, and potential suspects, which makes the vicar a potential asset and ally.

Set in post-war 1950's Cambridgeshire - near Cambridge - in the village of Grantchester, the scenery stars along with the inspired choice of actors. Cambridge is used for some street scenes. James Norton as the lanky and fair vicar is a non-judgmental, boyish vicar with whom you would like to go to the pub - he prefers strong whisky over the more clerical sherry choice. Interestingly, in real life James Norton has a spiritual bent. Norton read theology at Cambridge and journeyed to Nepal where he became intrigued by Buddhism. The non-preachy, non-doctrinal spirituality adds a little depth to this series which is refreshing. Robson Green as the detective inspector combines twinkle with grumpiness, and for comic interludes, Mrs. McGuire (Tessa Peake-Jones) is the taciturn, disapproving housekeeper of the vicar who judges everyone and everything, including the dog.

There are a few potential love interests to add spice to the series, but the real action portends to be in the crime-solving relationship of Detective Keating and Vicar Chambers.  For anglophiles, this will probably be a 5-star series as it has the necessary ingredients: a detective and sidekick (although the vicar functions more as the leading amateur detective with his understanding of human nature and ability to solicit secrets), a gobsmacking attractive English backdrop with proximity to Cambridge, engaging supporting characters in the form of a housekeeper, some love interests, and a really cute black lab puppy combined with whodunits to solve.  Another season has already been commissioned, so you won't be left wanting for too long once this six-episode season is over.  The series is based upon mysteries written by James Runcie.",1421539200,173,2176,5.379411764705883
8682160,2,B00O55UAQK,Got really bored with the tiresome romance in the first season - soap operish in the extreme.  The mystery part was good and I really wished such potentially interesting characters & their partnership on mysteries weren't dulled by sophomoric romantic obsession on the part of the main character.,1534032000,,296,5.166666666666667
8682161,2,B00O55UAQK,"I watched the first two seasons and just had to stop, unfortunately.  I want to rate it 5 stars and watch S3, but I'm done.  This series had the potential to be an excellent show and has first rate acting and interesting mysteries.  However, for a series about a man of God, it is frustrating and disappointing.  While no one is perfect, a minister must have high standards and be an example to others.  Sydney showed concern and love for others but his own life is a disaster.  He constantly struggles with substance abuse, drinking too much, smoking, and making poor decisions with women.  He self-medicates instead of looking to God and the Bible for strength, wisdom, and peace.  Seriously!!?  Some minister of God.  Sydney is not genuine.  He is a phony man of God.  Geordie is more genuine, because although he has problems also, he is true to his nature and not a hypocrite.  I like Sydney and Amanda and the other characters, but I couldn't take it anymore,  along with the constant profaning of the Lord's name.",1533859200,,1020,4.625698324022347
8682162,1,B00O55UAQK,"What would have been a great show in the spirit of Father Brown has, like everything else, succumbed to PC politics, immorality, and the LGBT tyrants.  1-2% of the population is homosexual. Yet somehow a gratuitous homosexual character or TWO wind up in PUBLICLY FUNDED PROGRAMMING. Disgraceful.  We are treated to gay kissing scenes. How shameful. I cannot help but wonder how much longer western civilization will stand. I'm disgusted.",1532044800,,437,5.228571428571429
8682163,4,B00O55UAQK,"James Norton is wonderful to watch in this role. An actor through and through. I appreciate that this show brings me a bit of calm every week without sacrificing smartness. Wish they would have done a better job with complexity of the female characters, especially the main love interest.",1529971200,,288,4.8979591836734695
8682164,5,B00O55UAQK,"Enjoyed watching all season. Got a little fustrated that James Norton's character kept getting drawn back into a bad relationship. I found myself talking to the T.V. saying ""What are your doing?!!""  Ah, amour!",1529625600,,209,5.147058823529412

8682166,5,B00O55UAQK,"I really enjoy this series.  The characters are life-like personalities that anyone could know.  The series addresses circumstances and life as we know it in todays world.  It gives me an insight into different cultures and life styles.  It doesn't force anything down your throat; but, helps you understand life around you.  I like the story line and mysteries that go with it.  Real-life situations that have to be dealt with.  I just love this series.",1528502400,,454,4.894736842105263
8682167,2,B00O55UAQK,"Started out with real promise. The James Norton/Robson Green pairing had real energy and possibility.  But since this is post-modern Britain, where cultural suicide is the highest virtue, it eventually became weighted down with the PC obsessions of the 21st century, projected back in time. Finally, alas, really alas, unwatchable.",1527811200,2,331,5.62
8682168,5,B00O55UAQK,"Grantchester ""had me at hello!""  Love, love, love the cast.  The young vicar struggling with his own humanity whilst trying to lead his congregation is superbly acted by James Norton.  Each episode is a stand alone but there is a common thread which connects all episodes.  Wonderfully written, brilliantly acted, with the English countryside as a backdrop makes Grantchester a must see.",1525564800,,387,5.193548387096774
