8448263,5,B004YG7J78,"This DVD is a must have for all fans of lighting with strobes!

I just cannot stop watching every bit of it.

Joe McNally has a professional way of teaching with soft humor, which makes the entire video so much fun to watch.

The design of the tutorials is very easy to understand, even for beginners like me!

Worth every penny...",1332028800,,331,4.377049180327869
8448264,5,B004YG7J78,"Couldn't catch Joe on the Flash Bus, so I guess the DVD is a cheaper way for me to attend his workshops.  If you're McNally fan as I am, and read his books (The Moment it Clicks, Hot Shoe Diaries etc.) -- the contents of the DVD should be familiar to you: what it does is it walks you through the steps and concepts,  and shows you what a book could not: action.  The presentation is simple enough, and anyone who's comfortable with camera controls and using other than program exposure mode - should grasp the content and laugh along with Joe as he trudges on.  David Hobby even appears as a Pizza Delivery man during an intermission, when Joe was fiddling with TTL exposure - while David Hobby set everything back to manual mode on the flashes, to nail the shot.

The DVD content is similar to the Nikon CLS video where McNally also does the walk through, though this time more examples.  Some may say it's a lot of mullah for two DVD's, but given the distance, it's the next best thing to being stateside and sitting in his seminar.",1319932800,2,1035,4.364583333333333
8448265,5,B004YG7J78,"These videos of Joe's are simply fantastic. If you've ever watched any of his videos, he not only covers the mechanics of lighting, but he also lets you know what he feels about it inside and the personal and human side of getting different kinds of lighting. It's classic Joe at his best.

I would highly recommend this to anyone to take their lighting skills up a notch!",1319932800,,372,4.470588235294118
8448266,5,B004YG7J78,"Joe is always fun and informative. I've sent so much time on his website, books, and DVDs that I FEEL we're friends. And when I went to the BusTour this year...I felt shunned when he didn't come up to me to say hello. LOL

One of the very! very BEST!!!",1312502400,2,252,4.04
8448267,5,B004YG7J78,"If you have never used off-camera flash before, this is a great place to start.  Here are few reasons why:

1. Joe is a passionate teacher and his communication style is clear and engaging.
2. He goes from the most simple ideas to the more complex setups.  There is something for all levels of photographers.
3. He makes deliberate mistakes and shows you the difference.
4. At the end of every shot, there is a clear diagram with the light setup.
5. Overall a very well produced DVD - great video and audio quality.  It always keeps you engaged. You can tell that he has put a lot of effort into creating it.
6. For Intermediate photographers this is probably equivalent to taking a very expensive workshop.

ONE GRIPE:  I wish he had provided a booklet with the photograph for each shot along with the corresponding light setup.

CANON USER ALERT:  You will take away only general concepts from this DVD.  If you want to know how to work your Speedlites check out Syl Arena's handbook (sold on Amazon) and his website - ""speedliting dot com""",1309392000,12,1042,4.559139784946237
8448268,5,B004YG7J78,"I just finished Joe MvNally,s Language of Light DVD and I must say, its nothing short of brilliant! In Joe's entertaining and insightful way he teaches exactly how to master your flash. At the end of each session he has a page with all camera settings and it's simple to understand. I would highly recommend this DVD! Ken Toney",1307491200,3,327,4.559322033898305
8448269,4,B004YG7J78,"Great set of DVD's!
Lots of useful tips both on how to setup lights, and on how to work with the Nikon CLS and iTTL.
I really enjoyed watching how he progresses through a shoot, ""moulding"" the composition, lighting and elements within the frame to arrive at his final product.
Only thing missing was an ipad/ipod version of the movie.",1307232000,,334,4.583333333333333
8448270,5,B004YG7J78,"Video is well put together, fun, and interesting.
Very basic in the beginning, but has some wonderful tips and tricks that make the video well worth the cost.
I've attended a seminar with Joe and still learned quite a few cool tricks from the DVD.

If you're already a pro you prob won't learn a ton of new stuff, but for novice and semi experienced I'd go for it.

Some cool bonus Nikon stuff on the disk as well.",1306108800,5,414,4.227848101265823
