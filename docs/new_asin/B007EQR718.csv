5079650,3,B007EQR718,"This concentrates more on the journey, than his actual comedy. It is interesting, and I certainly see Ray as a very personal and likeable fellow. More of an average person than most stars. While I certainly found it very interesting, I was starting to get bored about 1/2 way into this. But if you want to see the real Ray, it certainly is worth your time.",1399593600,,356,4.409090909090909
5079651,4,B007EQR718,"I picked this because it looked lonely on Instant Watch and for the most part I'm glad I did.

This movie is something you don't see every day: a candid view of a Hollywood star just doing his thing on the road.  Not a lot of pulled punches here but also no grand revelations.  It all turns out pretty much how you'd expect.  It has a few funny moments but nothing riotous.  Worth the current price of Free with Amazon Prime.",1396828800,,425,4.197530864197531
5079652,3,B007EQR718,"This video was somewhat entertaining, but not from a comical standpoint. It was more interesting from the standpoint of seeing what a top-name comic must endure when he goes on the road to do stand-up gigs.",1366329600,,206,4.75
5079653,5,B007EQR718,"95 MILES TO GO is an hysterically funny a movie about a road trip with two old friends, Ray Romano, star of Everybody Loves Raymond's and his fellow Raymond writer, Tom Caltabiano invite you to join them on their comedy tour. There are so many funny moments and scenes in this film. The DVD extras are also amazing, some of the best I've ever seen, including a full 22 minutes of Rays standup and Ray like you've never seen him before!

Definitely one for your comedy collection!",1345161600,2,479,4.505747126436781
5079654,5,B007EQR718,"I am a huge Ray Romano fan, so I knew from the beginning that I would love this DVD.  I live in the south so I was mildly curious how Ray would act driving through the south.  This DVD didn't disappoint me.  It was funny from the beginning, but all you really have to do is just show Ray Romano's face and I start laughing.  He is quirky and quite superstitious for a yankee boy.  I loved this DVD and am so happy that I have added this to my collection.  This DVD has some very good specials added to it....including Ray's stand-up act.  Buy this - you will be glad you did!",1342310400,2,575,4.035398230088496
5079655,4,B007EQR718,"95 Miles To Go - seems like it took 95 years to get to DVD. First released as an HBO special in 2004 with a short limited theatrical run, the Tom Caltibiano documentary finally sees the light of day on DVD. If you liked Sienfield's Comedian, you will like this. 95 MTG certainly has it's flaws, (a few instances it moves a little slowly, that's to be expected with this kind of undertaking and in an odd way adds to the charm), but there is enough here to keep your interest and be entertained. Insight to one of the world's most successful comedians and his relationship with Tom is explored in a witty fashion. I'm a fan of documentaries and Ray, so this was a no-brainer. What's best about this DVD is the ton of extras - Three commentaries, Screening Q&As, (must see), a stand-up act from Ray, (with an assist from Tom), outtakes, deleted scenes, etc. This DVD release was obviously a labor of love. 95 MTG will keep you busy for a while if you like commentaries and special features like I do. And the music created for the movie in addition to the licensed music were very well done. Go get a Subway hero, pull up to the screen and enjoy.",1338940800,7,1144,4.350467289719626
5079666,4,B007EQR718,If you like stand up and wonder what it's like to be in the road this gives you a glimpse.  Faily good paced and well done.,1455667200,,123,3.730769230769231
5079667,2,B007EQR718,"B-O-R-I-N-G. And I like Ray Romano. Usually a screenplay writer likes to start off with a bang. This film starts off slow (no bang) and gets slower. Sadly, the first ten minutes are indicative of the entire movie: Ray and his pal fly here, drive there, eat some room service pizza. Ray makes a phone call. Ummmmm....that's about it. In between such scintillating scenes he does some stand up.",1451520000,,392,4.695652173913044
5079668,2,B007EQR718,"Ray Romano driving a car, Ray Romano bitching like a whiny old lady, Ray Romano taking a crap and eating old food.

5079674,5,B007EQR718,"Being in the Comedy business myself as an entertainer's marketing manager, I REALLY appreciate this inside look of a famous Comedian's venture from one sold-out gig to another (in major cities).  This is TRUE 'REALITY' footage in the purest sense of the word.  I can really identify with with this documentary, and appreciate Tom's commitment and tenacity to create this movie, even though Ray wasn't too excited about the idea of filming and making it.

Being in comedy, and going from gig-to-gig (by car), this is how it is, folks!  I've experienced the same, but on a smaller scale, of course, since Ray's dealing with sold-out theaters in major cities, and with my own personal experience, we were going from one private gig to another.  However, the preparation and expectation from the guests/audience is basically the same.

The bottom line is, for the average person out there who is looking for comedy as entertainment (as a movie to make you laugh), this film documentary might not be what you're looking for, however for anyone in the entertainment business, especially comedians, who are aspiring to be successful performers, this is a wonderful piece for them to watch, since you're getting a 'fly on the wall' view of a famous comedian's journey traveling gig-to-gig.

Personally, I REALLY enjoyed and appreciated all the work that went into making it.  Thanks so much for putting the time, effort, and desire into actually creating this film, Tom, Roger and Ray!",1404000000,,1477,5.0
5079675,5,B007EQR718,A enjoyable documentary for all Romano and/or Everybody Loves Raymond fans. His close friend Tom kept Ray on track during all of the venues they performed at in Florida & Georgia. This was filmed during hiatus of Season 6 of Raymond but could have been made last week. Enjoyed Raymond and Tom's various stand up shows. They were also joined in one extra by Brad Garret. I am very glad I bought it as it is becoming very hard to get (no longer available on Netflix DVD),1403481600,,468,4.390804597701149

In the off chance you read these, it's all better when you produce it with friends. Good on you!

8515384,1,B007EQR718,"I read up on it, so I kind of knew what it was about, but I am still very disappointed. Very boring. Some footage put together from their travels in order to make money. They're in the van, then they eat something, then they're in the motel. Ray complains they're going to be late. There's a ten second raunchy comedy routine. If I want comedy that's dirty might as well listen to Larry the cable guy.",1469404800,,401,4.2894736842105265
