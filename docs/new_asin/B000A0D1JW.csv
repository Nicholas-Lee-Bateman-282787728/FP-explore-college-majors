It's not just the recipes that Jamie takes us through that makes this DVD so valuable, but it's the WAY in which he approaches cooking.  He's a proponent of buying local, organic food and cooking it in fresh, fast and interesting ways.  Sure, he has a certain charm about him, but that charm, I believe, comes from his love of what he does (more than the way he looks).  That love of food and cooking is infectious, and that is what gives this DVD power.

I think that this DVD would be a lovely gift for anyone who is interested in cooking.  (I bought it as a gift for myself and have thanked me repeatedly!)  This has certainly changed my mind about cooking DVDs and I'll now be purchasing the rest of the Jamie Oliver catalog as well!",1127088000,29,972,4.216216216216216
2344568,5,B000A0D1JW,"This DVD set is packed full of wonderful recipes and of course, Jamie Oliver's infectious style. He's out and about on his moped in London, stopping off at shops and cooking for all kinds of people. My daughter always sings along to the theme song when I play this DVD. To sum up, this is a fun, colorful and informative DVD. There are some great tips and the recipe cards included are a bonus. For anyone that has never watched one of Jamie's show, or if you just wish they'd show more on Food TV, this DVD is a money well spent!",1126742400,8,530,4.205882352941177

We put this on when we have friends over to get their mouths watering before we serve one of Jamie's dishes for dinner!! Cheers!

8071009,4,B000A0D1JW,"I am a big fan of Jamie Oliver and I think I have watched all his cooking shows since the original Naked Chef series came out. He is lively, entertaining, and shows how to prepare interesting and tasty dishes which you will most likely be able to recreate at home.

As in the earlier series, Oliver's Twist 2 combines a little picturesque shopping in London's specialty shops and markets to gather fresh ingredients with putting them together to make a fairly quick and easy meal in his kitchen back home for some people dropping in.

I thought that the two seasons of Oliver's Twist were some of Jamie's best shows. Each ran for 26 episodes and over the course of the two series I really found him making a lot of things that I wanted to try myself and felt able to prepare after seeing him make them.

This DVD set has fifteen episodes from the second season. Since the original season two ran for 26 episodes, 11 episodes have been left out. If you still want more after seeing this, the DVD set for the first season,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jamie-Oliver-Oliver-s-Twist/dp/B0000C0FMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jamie Oliver - Oliver's Twist</a>, brings you seven more episodes from that series.

The shows that you do find here and on the Season 1 discs are great and I enjoyed watching all of them. Following Jamie's examples has encouraged me to try new things and has made me a better cook. It's too bad that so many good shows are not included in the DVD compilations of the two series. I can't imagine why so many, especially in season one, were left out. If you can find all of the episodes from both seasons in reruns or somewhere on-line, I would encourage you to watch them, but until you do, these DVD sets with some of the best episodes from both seasons will be a very good start.",1343692800,,1846,4.777429467084639
8071010,5,B000A0D1JW,If you like Jamie Oliver than you can't go wrong with the Oliver's Twist series.  I have the first and second seasons and they are both inspiring and entertaining.,1296950400,,163,4.620689655172414

8071012,5,B000A0D1JW,"I am a professional cook, and I was absolutly blown away by this DVD.  Jamie Oliver is an inspriation to me and many other cooks that I know.  If you love to cook and love food, you will love this.  Smart, easy, beautiful dishes that are made with great product and lots of love!!!",1204934400,3,281,4.166666666666667
8071013,5,B000A0D1JW,"This is my 3rd DVD of Jamie Oliver and I love them all.  I'm waiting for any new DVDs of him!  He is very entertaining and colorful.  You won't be disappointed to watch him and even if you are not a good cook, like me, you get some pointers from his shows.  If you are thinking about buying this DVD, think no more, and start pressing the button to buy!  This is good if you missed some of the episodes.  As for me, I've watched them all before, but I still love having my own DVD of Jamie's shows.",1204761600,,498,3.9797979797979797
8071014,3,B000A0D1JW,"If you liked Steve Irwin (RIP), you're gonna love cookin' with Jamie.  He fills the kitchen with the same sort of exuberance, but more youthful.  No question that he is a likable bloke with passion and talent, but to me, his TV shtick - ""Hey, I'm gonna meet some of my mates down at the pub, and we're gonna to do some gourmet cooking while skateboarding"" -- is a little phony.

Television cooking has had a few wooden characters whose skill and precision were more intimidating than inspiring.  But that seems to me hardly the rule.  It is not like Jamie is filling a huge need to show people how to loosen up and have some fun in the kitchen.

Jamie is subliminally appealing to the common conceit of youth that all that is needed for art (culinary art, or any other worthy accomplishment) is the chaos of youthful enthusiasm.  I know that Jamie is a very successful chef and restauranteur.  I do not believe for one moment that he has achieved that success without some adult seriousness.

Unfortunately, Jamie's insistence on his scooter-riding, fun-loving persona gets in the way of teaching much of anything about food.  The show is fast-paced and chaotic, much more about Jamie's madcap style than about the food itself.

Because he does convey what I believe is a genuine passion, and perhaps genius, for cooking, and is likable and amusing, I give him more stars than I could ever justify if the criteria were closely tied to the DVD's value as a teaching/learning tool.",1166572800,6,1479,4.671814671814672
