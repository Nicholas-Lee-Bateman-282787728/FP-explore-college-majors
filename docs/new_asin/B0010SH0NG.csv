8238395,1,B0010SH0NG,"Do not waste your time with this movie. If it were free it would not be worth your time. Poorly filmed, terrible sound quality, poor acting and terrible screen play. Should be able to to give it zero stars. Actually caused nausea and abdominal cramps watching this movie.  I felt like I had food poisoning after watching this movie.",1363392000,,332,4.627118644067797
8238396,4,B0010SH0NG,"I really liked this movie. I was a shrink, so the main characters being psycho really appealed to me. Of course, my friend Tom Stedham is in it as well, so I'm heavily biased in my opinion.

Get over a couple of lighting issues, though, and you have a very solid B-movie. With a creepy clown. Scary!",1260835200,,299,4.245614035087719
8238397,4,B0010SH0NG,"Torment is a low-budget horror film from director Steve Sessions. I played a supporting role in the film as one of the victims so I may be a little biased in my review.

For the budget it had, the movie looks great. Suzi Lorraine pulls off a convincing portrayal of a woman who falls deeper and deeper into a world of a serial killer offing locals which may or may not be actually happening. Until her husband (Tom Stedham) is murdered, then what was thought to be all in her head becomes a living nightmare.

This has all the classic elements of a psychological slasher film. The final half hour really kicks into gear and is a non-stop thrill ride until the very end.

For such a small cast, I can assure you there is a high body count. This film uses the ""torture porn"" aspect but those scenes are pretty low key and not too disturbing.

Rent it or buy it when it comes out. All who were involved worked extremely hard on it and had an awesome time making it.",1201737600,9,962,4.269230769230769
8238398,4,B0010SH0NG,"This movie was a lot of fun to make. Suzi is a great actress, and willing to help others when they need it. I didn't get to work with some of the cast members, so I had to watch the movie to see their great performances.

The opening scene, where the evil clown tortures --- oh; I have to stop. I don't want to give anything away. Let me just say that watching Jade Lafont get tortured to death sets the tone right away for the rest of the movie. This is one sick clown!

And I'm warning everyone now, there are some really, REALLY big roaches in the movie. I know that some people are freaked out by clowns. But when I saw these giant cockroaches crawling across the floor... Ew[...]

It seems like a lot of ""directors"" are making low-budget horror movies these days. TORMENT is one you should make the effort to see.

And it will be shown at OMEGACON, the huge sci-fi convention in Birmingham, AL March 14-16. Suzi Lorraine is a featured guest there. Come see her and get your dvd autographed.",1201651200,4,995,4.304812834224599
