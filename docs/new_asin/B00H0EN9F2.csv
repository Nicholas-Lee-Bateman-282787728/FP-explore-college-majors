8629020,5,B00H0EN9F2,"My 2 year old really likes this DVD. It's one of the few cartoon DVDs he has (and he has many) that he will really sit and pay attention to for around 20 minutes. It's also not annoying for me, as his mom, to listen to or watch. I also love the fact that it introduces toddlers to historical cultures such as Ancient Egypt.",1515801600,,323,4.0625
