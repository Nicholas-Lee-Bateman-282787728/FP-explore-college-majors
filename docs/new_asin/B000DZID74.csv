2476007,2,B000DZID74,"Buying the 2006 Royal Rumble PPV was the biggest mistakes of my life. Out of the six matches on the card, only 2 were halfway descent. If this was a one brand show, I would still be disappointed but I would understand to a certain point. But the fact that this garbage was the best that two brands had to offer is just disgraceful.

Match 1- Cruiserweight Invitational for Cruiserweight- Kid Kash vs Paul London vs Funaki vs Jamie Noble vs Scotty 2 Hotty vs Gregory Helms

This was a solid Cruiserweight match. Every man got a few moves in. I especially loved London's Shooting Star press. Despite the fact that this match was good, it was way too short. If another 8 minutes were added, this match could've been great. Instead, it was a pretty good way to start the show. 7.5/10

Match 2- Mickie James vs Ashley with Special Guest Referee Trish Stratus

All 3 girls looked very hot in this match (as always). This does not excuse the fact that the wrestling was of a v very poor quality. It was very slow paced and the moves were very poorly executed. I believe there were some 'boring' chants in the crowd throughout the match. 3.5/10

Match 3- JBL vs Boogeyman

Don't bother watching this. Not only was this match one of the worst matches I've ever seen and totally boring, t was of no significance what so ever. This match can be summed up in one word- disgraceful. 0/10

Match 4- The Royal Rumble Match

This was a very enjoyable match. There was some nice wrestling at different stages and a few nice surprises throughout the match. I felt that everybody contributed to this match in one way or another, whether it was for humour purposes or to add to the structure of the match. I thought that the surprise entrances added a breath of fresh air and both Tatanka and Goldust performed pretty well. This match saw the return of the exciting Rob Van Dam who is one of my favourite performers. This match also helped progress the Michaels-McMahon saga with Shane O' Mac throwing Shawn over the top rope. On the negative, I think that Mysterio and Triple H added nowhere near enough to this match as they were the first two in, but were only contributing for 40% of the match. It was quite obvious that Mysterio would win and I would've liked for a more surprising result.  Overall, this was a very entertaining way to spend an hour of my life. Other than those two things, the 2006 Royal Rumble Match is a good one. 8.75/10

Match 5- WWE Championship- Edge with Lita vs John Cena

This match was really disappointing for me. It had no flow or rhythm. Their moves occured at random times and were poorly put together. Another problem was that there was little to no technical wrestling in this match (not that many of Cena's matches do). The only thing I  enjoyed was Cena's cool entrance. Other than that, very disappointing. 5/10

Match 6- World Heavyweight Championship- Kurt Angle vs Mark Henry

This is a difficult match to rate. It has some solid wrestling but it is soooo boring. Henry seems like a very hard wrestler to work with. He is so big and very hard to perform moves on. The match is well put together and the chair shot is pretty cool. I just can't overlook the boringness of this match. 5.5/10

Overall Royal Rumble 2006 is a pretty bad PPV. There were only two matches that I can see myself watching again (The Rumble match and Cruiserweight Invitational).  This is meant to be one of the biggest stages of the year but the performances on this night were not up to scratch. I certainly hope that WWE  put on better shows in SummerSlam and Survivor Series. This is a bad way to start the road to WrestleMania 22.",1155081600,,3633,4.472012102874433
2476008,3,B000DZID74,"The Royal Rumble 2006 had great potential.  On paper, the card looked real good, but most of the matches that I was looking forward too seeing didn't meet my expectations.  The opener was a great way to start the show, nothings more exciting than Cruiserweight action.

The match itself was good, with some great spots including Paul London doing a shooting-star press to the outside of the ring.  Gregory Helms wins with the Shining Wizard.

The next match saw Ashley vs Mickie James with speical Referee Trish Stratus.  Trish looked smokin', as did Ashley and Mickie.  In the ring, Ashley actually suprised me with some nice wrestling action, and Mickie looked great in the ring as usual.  The match itself, though, went on too long!  If it ended about five minutes earlier, it would of been your average diva's match.  But it just dragged on too long.  Mickie wins, and ""thanks"" Trish afterwards even though she called it fairly.

Boogey Man vs JBL was a squash of a match.  Boogey Man did one move and won.  No, I'm not lieing he literally did one move.  The only entertaining part was his enterance.

Then, comes the Royal Rumble.  It was fantastic as usual, this year it seemed that bigger names were in the event.  I was pulling for Triple H, and he did do real well, lasting until the bottom three.  Also, Lashley, and Carlito impressed me with their performances.  Rey Mysterio ofcourse ends up winning.

Cena vs Edge, what was going on with this match?  Cena and Edge can put on spectacular shows, but yet this seems to be one of the worse matches of the night.  The only part even worth watching was Edge spearing Cena into the steel steps.  Other than that I thought it was a snorefest.  Oh and Cena's enterance was real cool.  If Cena wouldn't of won the title, it would of been one of the least exciting WWE title matches I have ever seen.

Kurt Angle vs Mark Henry was unique, and entertaining.  I really liked how Kurt Angle was the underdog and Mark Henry was going over as the unstoppable giant.  Mark Henry suprisingly dominated the majority of the match.  In the end Angle nails Davari with a chair, and puts some nasty chair shots on Mark Henry.  Angle wins.  In the end, Undertaker comes out to a pretty entertaining way to end the night, with some nice pyro and the ring collapsing.

Overall, you can say that the Royal Rumble was simpily average.  The Royal Rumble match itself though, is a reason to buy the DVD.  I purchased it at Wal-Mart for a cheap $17.  Not many extras on the DVD though.

I give the overall PPV a 3 out of 5 stars.",1153267200,,2562,4.479392624728851

4. The 2006 Royal Rumble

Here we go! The WWE throws a much better match into this show. I was very happy with this match. They did well putting superstars in at good times, good eliminations, good storylines through out, I was for Triple H in this one and OH, he was close. Very good match, with an exciting ending. Better then the last few years

9 out of 10

5. Edge (C) v. John Cena

Disapointing. This match was good, don't get me wrong. But we all know both these men can put on great matches, they didn't do it here. I never got all excited and interested in this one. The most I let out was ""Eh, cool spear.""

7 out of 10

6. Kurt Angle (C) v. Mark Henry

Mark Henry... Is that the best they had? Honestly, come on. They could've put many other (worthy) superstars in this main event. Altho I despise watching Henry they put on a rather good match. They did well together but I just couldn't get over the fact... Mark Henry was in the main event.

1. Cruiserweight Invitational Open Match for the Cruiserweight Title

A pretty good match, however no one cares about the cruiserweights.  Not a bad way to start the show however, as it was fast paced.  **1/4

2. Mickie James vs. Ashley Special Referee Trish Stratus

This match was horrible, and had nothing riding on the line.  Was only used to further the fued with Mickie James and Trish Stratus.  For the love of god skip this unless you want to see trish who's attire isn't very revealing so don't waste your time. 1/4*

3. The Boogeyman vs. JBL

One word: SKIP. A complete squash match, and also a complete trash match. DUD

4. Royal Rumble Match

I didn't know why this match was before the main events but I would find out later.  This was match of the night, although that's not saying much.  As far as rumbles go it was pretty good, but Rey winning the Royal Rumble made me sick.  I can safely say that the second he won, I went into my basement and broke things, including a bone in my hand on the punching bag.  A bit of overreacting, probably considering there was nothing I could do to change things, but I was pretty freakin' pissed off.  I enjoy Mysterio in the ring, but I think he wins too much to be even remotely believable and since Eddie's passing he has been a total charity case.  You can bet your bottom dollar that I wasn't pleased when he won the title at wrestlemania.  ***1/4

5. WWE Title Match: John Cena (c) vs. Edge

We finally had a deserving/good champion in edge, and a meer 3 weeks later he was taken away from us by the abomination of a wrestler/personality/talker known as John Cena.  His rapper gimmick makes me almost as sick as his wrestling skills.  I don't care if people call him a ""brawler"" if that's the case then he's an abysmal brawler. As far as a match is conserned this one's ok, however it seemed like a raw match.  If you actually buy this ppv give this a look, one is all you'll need.  **1/4

6. World Heavyweight Title Match: Kurt Angle (c) vs. Mark Henry

Ugh, just Ugh.  Kurt did all he could to make this watchable however Henry is far too bad to allow it.  Absolutely shockingly poor match here. Kurt wins, thank god, and that's all you need to know.  Don't bother with this one.  1/2* if you are very, very generous.

All in all this is one of the worst/most disapointing PPVs I have ever seen.  It just made me sick to my stomach.  The Undertaker coming out at the end of the Angle Match was the only thing keeping me from taking this tape out of the VCR and immediately setting it on fire.  Please for the sake of Africa don't buy this or even look at it in the store it will blind you with its awefulness.

UPDATE! Since reviewing this ppv I have in fact set the tape on fire.  I felt it was best for everyone.",1147564800,5,2851,4.299435028248587
2476013,3,B000DZID74,"This was a pretty good PPV and royal rumble overall. Even though some matches should not have been scheduled, it's worth buying it due to the good matches. The only bad thing is they should've put the royal rumble as the main event. I mean, cmon, the name of the ppv is THE ROYAL RUMBLE. It's incredible to see Rey win the rumble after dedicating a victory to the late Eddie Guerrero. VIVA LA RAZA!

1. 6-MAN CRUISERWEIGHT OPEN INVITATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH : Kid Kash vs. Funaki vs. Jamie Noble vs. Nunzio vs. Paul London vs. Gregory Helms  8/10

Fun match, and a great start to the rumble. It was a highflying match and I wanted to see London win it. It was a fun match until the end but I'm just dissapointed that Helms won it. I mean, who wants Gregory Helms as Cruiserweight Champion?

2. Ashley Massaro vs. Mickie James with special guest referee Trish Stratus 2/10

The only two good things about this match is Trish and Ashley. Mickie James is a physco. She just plain scares me. Ashley needs more training from Trish Stratus to become a better wrestler. Mickie just needs to crawl into a hole and dissapear. Skip this match.

3. JBL vs. The Boogeyman 5/10

The Boogeyman actually amuses me. It's fun to see him scare the hell outta whoever he wants to. And I think JBL is just a piece of crap. He should go take his million dollars, and fix up his face. Since I strongly dislike JBL, seing him lose makes this match all that better. If you want a good wrestling match, you're not going to get one here. If you want entertainment - watch it.

4. The Royal Rumble Match 10/10

All for Eddie. Rey Mysterio won it in one of the most exciting rumble matches i've seen. We saw the return of Eugene, Tatanka, Goldust, and of course - Mr. Monday Night ROB VAN DAM!. Van Dam is the most exciting part of the match. We saw Shawn Michaels get tossed out by Shane McMahon. We saw Booker T and the coach get tossed out in two seconds (two guys I can't stand) We saw Rey lastly toss out Triple H and Randy Orton - (two more guys I can't stand.) Congrats to the ultimate underdog Rey Mysterio.

5. WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Edge (w. Lita) vs John Cena 5/10

Great Entrace to start off the match by John Cena. Though I don't like him that much, I'd much rather see John Cena walk out as the champ than the rated-r superstar. Edge controlled for the beginning of the match, but at the end, if you're a cena fan or an edge hater, it was awesome. Edge accidentally speared Lita, Cena hit the F-U, then (the best part) made Edge tap to the STFU. Boring at first, but fun ending.

6. WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Kurt Angle vs. Mark Henry 4/10

Not a great main event, but another good ending thanks to the Undertaker. Kurt Angle had been gaining my respect each week on Smackdown since switching over from Raw. I'm glad that he won but the match was a little predictable. Mark Henry dominating at the beginning, Daivari getting involved. Kurt using a low blow, chairs, and an exposed turnbuckle to finally pin Henry. I can tell you I wasn't suprised. Fastfoward to the end to see the deadman crashing in on Angle's celebration :).

Pretty good rumble. Could've done better.",1145145600,,3171,4.407534246575342
2476014,4,B000DZID74,"Match 1 - Show Starts with a CW free for all, GOOD Match, if memory serves, its ROH alumnis, Paul London, Nunzio aka Little Guido, Funaki, Sugar Shane Helms, the king of the hoo-dayn-canrana Kid Kash and the master of the Noble-bomb Jamie Noble. Helms comes away with the win after a shining wizard and thusly dethrones a very trailor looking Kid Kash. not really a spot fest as much as its 6 CWs having a match. 4 outta 5 star match.

Match 2 - Ashley vs Mickie James with Special Ref. Trish. Obviously the sole purpose of this match was to continue the Trish/Mickie storyline, and not much else. the Story continues, but at the expense of a truly subpar women's match. Mickie can wrestle, but Ashley might wanna stop hangin out with uhhhhhV1uhhhh so much and learn how to not look like a charging retard in the ring ala Torrie Wilson. but since there was eye candy galore in this bout, i'll give it two stars. Mickie wins by the way. 2 outta 5 stars.

Match 3 - Boogeyman vs JBL. I have yet to see a good Boogeyman match. but to his credit, he did get rid of Jillian Hall's... thing. Boogerman wins via a JBL job. 1 outta 5 stars.

Match 4 - The Royal Rumblus. VERY entertaining match. aside from Rey and HHH resting in the corners for the majority of the match. but indeed, outcome aside, a very good Royal Rumble. goes over 60 minutes, as it's a 30 man, one entrant every 90 second, over the top rope battle royale. I think WWE is really starting to get the hang of fixing every single Rumble entry, as this Rumble had some pretty good showdowns. Not to mention the exceptional Rumble debut of Carlito, the return of Rob Van Dam, superstars and former champions galore, and an overall very exciting match. I was bummed when Rey won, as I was pulling for either RVD or Orton to win the whole thing, but RVD will win the WWE Title at ONS2, so alls good there. But it's NO secret that Orton got lowballed HARDCORE in this feud, and Rey Mysterio is thee biggest charity case since.... well thats another story for another review. Rey wins... for Eddie. 5 outta 5 star match.

Match 5 - WWE Title, Edge w/ Lita vs John Cena. Cena comes out to some crazy spaceship entrance thats absolutely bonkers. the match goes about 10/15 minutes with Cena winning with the STFU and thusly regaining the WWE Championship and the crowd goes wild. Frankly the match they have the next night on Raw is better and I hope it's on the dvd, as it's a truly superb match. as for this one, nothing too special, your average face overcomin the odds to take what's his kinda deal. 3 outta 5 star match. but becuz the WWE Title is on the line, AND changes hands, thus making it a historic night, I'll give it 4. 4 outta 5 star match.

Match 6 - WHT, Kurt Angle vs Mark Henry. I don't even know what to write about this match. It really isn't very exciting, despite having Kurt Angle in it. Mark Henry I'd say is underrated as he hasn't had a bad match since returning to wwe.....aside from this match. Angle and Henry just have zero chemistry and shouldn't have any more one on one matches. But to his credit, Angle keeps it going via his signature moves and a chairshot. 2 outta 5 star match.

Overall a 4 star ppv. Aside from Taker doing his usual crapping on the parade shtick at the end of the ppv (see Survivor Series 2005), I enjoyed it.",1144627200,,3317,4.316211878009631

6) MARK HENRY VS KURT ANGLE: THIS MATCH IS REALLY BORING. HORRIBLE ENDING. THE ONLY GOOD PART IS WHEN THE MATCH IS OVER BECAUSE UNDERTAKER RETURNS AND STRIKES THE RING WITH LIGHTENING BOLTS MAKING THE RING COLLAPSE.",1141862400,,1066,4.709677419354839

Match #1 - Crusierweight Championship - Open Invitational

Rating: 4.5/5 stars

-I always enjoy watching the crusierweight division because it is always unpredictable. Even though the match was a last-minute addition to the event, it was exciting. Plenty of high flying moves keeps interest, all the time.

Match #2 - Ashley vs. Mickie James

Rating: 1.5/5 stars

-The Women's division has really suffered as of late. There were too many mistakes. Some moves were executed poorly, and the overall match was really not great. The reason it gets 1.5 stars? Camera angles are always up to par in women's matches!

Match #3 - Boogeyman vs. JBL

Rating: 3.5/5 stars

-The match itself was average, but the Boogeyman's character is what makes this match interesting. I'm not crazy about the Boogeyman, but it was worth a watch.

Match #4 - The Royal Rumble Match

Rating: 5/5 stars

-This was the best match, by far. It's always great to watch the rumble, because there's so much going on at once. Rey Mysterio wins, shockingly, but otherwise, excellent as usual.

Match #5 - WWE Championship - John Cena vs. Edge

Rating: 4/5 stars

-Not the best match that these two will ever have, but respectable. Nice entrance by John Cena, and for me, surprising to see him win back the title. I thought that Edge would have the title longer, but whatever. Cena seems to be the next big thing in the WWE, and it's only fitting to have him headline Wrestlemania.

Match #6 - World Heavyweight Championship - Kurt Angle vs. Mark Henry

Rating: 2.5/5 stars

-It was obvious that Mark Henry wasn't going to beat Angle. So, that alone makes you not want to watch it. Also, very surprising to see that this was the last match. But, for what it was worth, the match was OK. It gets 2.5 stars because of two things: Kurt Angle (arguably the best wrestler in the WWE), and the Undertaker's appearance. Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle...now that's a real treat! Too bad it was at No Way Out and won't happen at Wrestlemania, but whatever.

Again, if you're just a casual fan of wrestling, this might not be a good fit for you. However, if you're a lifelong, hardcore fan like me, then its' time to add this DVD to your collection! The Power is Back!",1140480000,,2423,4.606060606060606

Good match that was fast paced and had an incredible move by Paul London to the outside. A bit too short though.

RATING: 83/100

Mickie James vs. ashley

Poor womens match that should have rather just been on Raw for a higher quality match to replace it here. Ashley pulled Mickie down as there was nothing really going for it.

RATING: 57/100

Boogeyman vs. JBL

Horrific squash. I find it hard to believe and very unreasonable that last year JBL could beat Big Show and Angle to retain the WWE Title, and this year at the same PPV he would lose in a 2 minute squash. Unbelievable

RATING: 35/100

Royal Rumble

Foolish decision to not make this the main event as it was by far the best match of the night. Very enjoyable the whole way through and I thought it was handled very well. Great to see Mysterio win a Rumble which was a true underdog story. One of the better Royal Rumbles in my opinion.

RATING: 90/100

Cena vs. Edge

I do not know why WWE would spend so much money unnecessarily on Cena's entrance if he wasn't even the champion going into the match, and if they were that desperate to spend the money on an entrance they should have rather spent it on Edge who was the champ walking to the match. I feel this should have been before the Royal Rumble, but it was still a good match. I just do not know how Cena could take so much punishment and then do an FU for the win. I would have much preferred Edge to retain into Wrestlemania. Oh well. Still a good match.

RATING: 82/100

Mark Henry vs. Kurt Angle

Poor main event to one of the biggest PPVs of the year. At least it was kept short. Good to see Angle retain and the segment with Undertaker afterwards was excellent, although I would have rather more emphasis was put on the end and more time was given to show the destruction of the ring.

RATING: 72/100

70% - Compared to last years very solid card and one of the best PPVs of the year, this failed to match up. The mid card matches were extremely disappointing with the exception of the cruiserweight match. Royal Rumble match should have been the main event. The Royal Rumble match carried this to the rating it got, and if it wasn't for that, this PPV would have been horrendous.",1140307200,,2228,4.340579710144928

2476026,3,B000DZID74,"The 2006 version of WWE's Royal Rumble featured a good Royal Rumble and, a mediocre undercard, and two fairly poor main events.

1. Cruiserweight Invitational: Kid Kash (C) v. Funaki v. Jaime Noble v. Paul London v. Nunzio v. Gregory Helms

This was a pretty good match with alot of high flying moves and some solid technical wrestling. Its one of the stronger matches on the card but it wasn't given nearly enough time to really take off. Predictable ending.

2. Ashley Massaro v. Mickie James (with Trish Stratus as Special Guest Referee)

Generally speaking, the women's division on Raw is fairly poor, with the division mainly consisting of Ashley, Mickie and Trish, and this match shows just how weak the division is. Ashley completely tanked in her first major match while Mickie James proved to be average. Trish made the match somewhat interesting as the guest referee but there isn't much to see here.

3. JBL v. Boogeyman

This match is worth seeing only for the Boogeyman's antics. Otherwise, there's nothing to talk about here. Very weak match, one of the worst I've seen on a PPV in awhile. Complete squash.

4. The 2006 Royal Rumble

Although you could figure out down to two or three men who would win by the time numbers one and two came out, this was a fairly good Royal Rumble. A couple surprise returns and a surprise entrant made the match even more interesting, and Rob Van Dam looked good in his first match in almost a year. This is the strongest match of the night, but it was really underplayed and the fact that it wasn't even the main event, but the fourth match out of six indicates that whoever won the match won't be in the main event at Wrestlemania.

5. Edge (C) v. John Cena

This match was decent. Edge is capable of putting on some very good matches and when you put Cena in the ring with someone who can wrestle, he usually looks decent. His gimmick is still revolting, and its a shame that Edge is being pushed to the back so that Cena can be champion again. His 9 month reign was fairly abysmal and its hard to be positive about his second title run, but so long as he's bringing in extra revenue for the company with his mediocre rap record, he'll be the champion.

6. Kurt Angle (C) v. Mark Henry

This match was absolutely awful. There is no reason that Mark Henry should ever be in the main event of a major pay per view like the Royal Rumble. Angle did all he could to make this match worth watching, but he failed. Fortunately, it was rather short. The Undertaker's appearance after the match was the most interesting part, though it could have been saved for the next episode of Smackdown! so that the Royal Rumble could have been the main event, as it should be.

The Royal Rumble is my favorite event of the year, but outside of the Rumble match itself, there is nothing really worth watching here, except maybe for the Cruiserweight Invitational. If you really love Rumble matches, buy this, otherwise, don't waste your money as the rest of the event isn't nearly good enough to justify dropping more than a couple dollars on.",1139356800,30,3074,4.527075812274369
2476027,3,B000DZID74,"To me, this year's ""Royal Rumble"" was a mere shocker to me. I thought it would be great with the creative logo and promos, but I was obviously wrong. This PPV had problems, such as the ""Royal Rumble"" not being in the Main Event, but instead, it's booked in the middle. Hello? The PPV is called ""Royal Rumble"". That would mean that the Royal Rumble battle royal match should be THE Main Event. I also understood why they didn't make it last (The Undertaker's return). The match could of been SO much better... Anyway, here are my ratings for each of the matches.

Match #1 - Six-Man Cruiserweight Championship - To my surprise, this turned out to be great. All six men put good effort into this one. My Highlight of the Match: When Paul London attempts the Shooting Star Press to the outside, but nobody catches him (sort of), and gets back up to his feet. Was weird, but the move looked pretty nice. 7.5/10

Match #2 - Mickie James vs. Ashley (Special Guest Referee: Trish Stratus) - This bored me. In my opinion, Ashley needs more training. One point for Trish's outfit, and another for Mickie James aggression attempts. 2/10

Match #3 - JBL vs. The Boogeyman - I'll say it three times. Skip this. Skip this. Skip this. This was a big waste of time even though it was short. 1/10

Match #4 - The Royal Rumble Match - Pretty good, had few surprises like: Tatanka/Eugene/Goldust returns, Triple H eliminating The Big Show AND Kane at the same time (wasn't that much of a surprise considering that both were very close to being eliminated) and of course, Rey Mysterio's victory. Great moment for Rey and fans of him, he went through the ENTIRE match (over 62 minutes, holds the record I think) from Entry #2 (which I consider to be the EXACT thing of being #1... Difference is that #1 goes out to the ring first. Big deal.) Still disappointing. The 2005 & 2004 Royal Rumbles were VERY great. Besides that, the 2006 is probably worth a watch or two. 7.5/10

Match #5 - WWE Championship - John Cena vs. Edge - A decent match between the two. Nothing special. Only thing I liked was Cena's entrance (He comes out in some sort of space shuttle thing). I liked their rematch on RAW (January 30, 2006 edition). I'm pretty much sure that most people knew that Edge would lose the title in this one. 6/10

Match #6 - World Heavyweight Championship - Mark Henry vs. Kurt Angle - This was boring for a Main Event, but it was decent just like the WWE Championship match previously. I liked it a bit, but this was nothing special. 5.5/10

Aftermath: The lights go out, the gongs are heard... The Undertaker is back! He comes out, with his usual attire with some druids and a horse (I think... Don't remember that much). He stops at the middle of the ramp and raises his arms, summoning pyros. He keeps them there, then throws his arms down, and purple lightning strikes the ringposts. The ring collapses and Taker signals that he's gonna win the World Heavyweight title (I wonder when are they gonna have Taker as champ again, but I don't think it will be anytime soon). And that's a wrap.

Overall - 29.5/60. WOW. Shame shame shame. Don't buy this unless your a huge Royal Rumble fan. My recommendation is to just rent this.",1139356800,2,3211,4.495711835334477

Trish Stratus Special Referee

Absolute waste of time match. All 3 women are hot, but looks does not equal good wrestling

2006 Royal Rumble match

Triple H and Rey Mysterio enter at 1 and 2, respectively and last the entire match. Throughout the match, Triple H does a great job of hanging in there, nearly being eliminated at least a dozen times. Shawn Michaels gets eliminated by Shane McMahon and Rey Mysterio wins after eliminating Triple H and Randy Orton. Surprise entrants Tantaka, Eugene and Goldust

Match rating: 4/5

John Cena vs Edge(c)

WWE Championship

A regular John Cena match, On the defensive the entire match, comes back with 3 or 4 moves, locks in the STFU and we have a new WWE Champion. The rematch the next night on Raw was a much better match for John Cena. He was much more agressive and show more dominance in that one match than he did the past 9 months he was the WWE Champion. I hope he can keep it up heading into Wrestlemania against Triple H

Match rating: 3/5

Kurt Angle(c) vs Mark Henry

World Heavyweight Championship

Absolutely disappointing match. I wonder what Vince was thinking putting someone as good as Kurt Angle in the ring with stupid Mark Henry, especially after Henry injured Batista. Angle wins after a rollup. Undertaker makes his return, sending a message to Angle that he wants the World Heavyweight Championship and makes the ring collapse.

It's a tragedy that Eddie Guerrero died too soon.  Guerrero's family has my deepest sympathy.  Unfortunately for Mysterio, he won't make it to Wrestlemania to challlenge Kurt Angle for the World Heavyweight championship.  It will be Randy Orton and Kurt Angle for the World Heavyweight championship with Orton winning the belt and Triple H will defeat John Ceana for the WWE championship.

Hes' had to rely on dedicating his matches to the late Eddie Guerrero, making it seem as if he can't get over himself, which he has proven to over his career, but ask WWE that. The result? People will get sick of Rey doing everything in memory of Eddie and boo him.

1. Cruserweight Invitaitonal Battle Royale: Kid Kash vs Funak vs Jamie Noble vs Paul London vs Nunzio vs Gregory Helems: Kid Kash defends the cruserweight title in a match booked quite like the SD royale for the world title, with a former RAW wrestler, Gregory Helms, jumping ship to contend for the belt, lengthier match than usual for the cruserweights with some great top rope splashes and gripping spots from Paul London and Helmes respectifully, Kash has no say in the decision to crown a new champion, Helmes pins Funaki to win the belt. ***

2. Ashley vs Micki James: Trish guest referees this sloppy womens' match, Ashley seriously can't wrestle and Mickie had trouble pulling much of anything out of her, Mickie wins much to Trishs' relcutancy. **1/2

3. The Boogeyman vs JBL: Short as you could reasonably expect to hide Boogeymans' weaknesses and limitations, quick win does the job for Boogey on JBL. DUD

4. Royal Rumble Match: Placing the rumble in the mid-card killed the crowd for the remainder of the night, Hunter and Mysterio draw numbers one and two but stay out of the way of many of the competitors, Mysterio doesn't really do as much here as in 2005, whilst Hunter occasionally interacted, the best offerings came from Matt Hardy, Chavo Guerrero, Chris Benoit, and Carlito. Most unintentionally hilarious spots came when RVD, suffering from ring rust, made two sloppy dropkicks that forced Carlito and Goldust to eject themselves. Orton is the final person eliminated, by Mysterio to win the match ***

5. WWE Championship: Edge vs John Cena: quite curiously, the best part of the match was Cenas' entrance, a giant space ship like ramp that descends in front of the crowd, it doesn't do much to satisfy anyone beyond tweleve years old or a girl, because, you know, Cenas' entire fanbase comprises of children and girls. Cena and Edge have a weak match here that is soon topped by the rematch the next night on RAW, F-U and an STFU guarantee another boring reign for WWEs' answer to Roland Rat, even when the ratings were much better with Edge as champion. **

6. World Heavyweight Championship: Kurt Angle vs Mark Henry: The reason the rumble was put in the mid-card become obvious after this match, pretty much a reasonable well paced encoutner which sees Angle using heel tactics to keep Henry down, using steel chairs and the ropes to pin him, The Undertaker emerges to challenge Angle for the belt and causes the ring to collapse. **

Crusierweight Championship

Kid Kash [Champion] vs. Paul London vs. Jamie Noble vs. Funaki vs. Nunzio vs. Gregory Helms:

Great match to open the show, all the men gave it their all and I am glad Helms is on Smackdown instead of the no man's land of Heat. Lots of high flying moves and the best one was when Paul London hit a backwards moonsault type move and landed on 3 or 4 different guys. Gregory Helms gets the win and becomes the crusierweight champ once again! 8/10 [Not very long but very good]

Ashley vs. Mickie James

[Trish Stratus as Guest Referee]:

I appreciate the fact that Ashley wants to learn to wrestle, but she still has a lot to learn. Trish looked nice in that ref outfit, and the story of Mickie James and Trish Stratus continued to get more interesting. Mickie James gets the win after powerbombing Ashley from the top rope. 4/10

JBL vs. The Boogeyman:

No, no, no. This was not a match, this was a waste of time. The Boogeyman spits worms into Jillian Hall's face and then JBL punches the Boogeyman around and outside the ring, only to get pinned after a pump-handle slam. Do yourself a favor and skip this match. 1/10

Royal Rumble Match

Winner goes to WM 22:

Nice Royal Rumble, some good moments such as Simon Dean trying to slap a high five to HHH, only to get thrown out of the ring. Some wrestlers were eliminated right away, and Triple H and Rey Mysterio lasted the entire Royal Rumble from number's 1 and 2.

Other moments include Vince and Shane McMahon screwing HBK out of winning the Royal Rumble. Rob Van Dam returned with a vengeance and took out Carlito with some stiff kicks. Other names such as Kane, Big Show, Ric Flair, and Randy Orton all fell short of winning the Royal Rumble. But in the end Rey Mysterio survived former fellow Evolution members, Randy Orton and HHH to win the Royal Rumble, the first man to win it entering at #2. 10/10

WWE Championship

Edge [Champion] vs. John Cena:

It was a real shock to see Cena's entrance from that giant catwalk/space ship thing, it was even a bigger shock to see him win the title again. That's right, Cena made Edge tap out to the STFU to win his second WWE Championship. The match was okay, and the crowd was really into Edge winning and Cena winning. Highlights include Edge spearing Cena into the steel steps, and then accidentally hitting Lita, which cause Cena to hit the FU and the STFU for the win. 8/10

World Heavyweight Championship

Kurt Angle [Champion] vs. Mark Henry:

Not the greatest of main events, but Kurt managed to save this one from being completely boring. The ref gets knocked down and Angle first hits Daivari with a steel chair then gives two stiff chair shots to Henry. Henry still kicks out but Angle rolled Henry up and with the help of the ring ropes, retained his title. 7.5/10

After the match the Undertaker comes out and sets off a lot of pyros while motioning that he wants the world belt, and the whole ring literally collapses....

The Royal Rumble is okay to see for the Royal Rumble Match, the Crusierweight Match, and Trish Stratus in that ref's outfit! Also Undertaker's return is cool to see. Other than that the rest of the matches are medicore at best, but the Royal Rumble match saved this from being a total dud. 3 and a half stars for a good ppv.",1138579200,,3526,4.445652173913044

JBL vs. Boogeyman

Good job keeping this match short cuz neither guys can wrestle 4/10

In my opinion a good rumble...and it was good because you really didn't know who was gonna win...Rey mysterio wins the big one and lets hope he actually gets to wreslte for the title at mania 9/10

WWE Championship

WWE Champion Edge vs. John Cena

I hate john cena as champion but i hate edge even more...edge doesnt seem like he shoul be champion..he doesnt fit the bill..anyway this was a pretty good match but it should have been last...John cena wins the title back with an stfu 8/10

World Heavyweight Championship

World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Mark Henry

Mark Henry cant wreslte for his life..it was kinda hard to have to watch him..thank god Kurt Angle was the one wreslting him so it made the match a little more barable to watch...Nice chair shots by kurt..awful finish with the roll up ..6/10

2476037,2,B000DZID74,"PRELUDE
---I am a very patient WWE fan.  The worst PPV I have even seen this decade is ""Armageddon 2004"", and that's the only one I've ever given a two-star rating this year.  This entry in the Royal Rumble anthology is pathetic at best.  Also, this is based on a PPV viewing, because I'm not gonna check out the DVD.

WARNING
---There will be spoilers, because I don't think this is worth even a rental!

REVIEW
1) Cruiserweight Championship
Kid Kash (champion) vs. Funaki vs. Jamie Noble
vs. Nunzio vs. Paul London vs. Gregory Helms
---With six of the best Cruiserweights around, there is no reason this one should feel flat.  Paul London and Jamie Noble are the only guys who are really trying to give us our money's worth.  Everybody else is really disappointing.  Cruiserweight matches can be a variety of styles (technical, hardcore, high-flying), but this one plays out like a weak Tornado match.  The most genius spot in this opener is a time when FOUR consecutive out-of-ring splashes are performed.  But in that spot, the wrestles at ringside just stand and have that look of ""Wait don't move, let's try to catch him.""  Having RAW superstar Gregory Helms enter this one is a nice touch, but his victory is bittersweet because he doesn't perform well until the last minutes or two.  Although this one is never boring, it's rarely exciting.
""6 out of 10""

2) Trish Stratus as Special Referee
Mickie James vs. Ashley
---I really like where this Mickie/Trish storyline is going.  I think Mickie James is the best Diva to join the RAW roster in a long while.  But Ashley has always sucked since she first came on in the summer of 2005, and she shows no signs of getting better.  Mickie James has no talent to work with, Trish isn't given good material to show off her refereeing duties, and Ashley can't sell any moves, nor can Ashley deliver moves without telegraphing them like they're scripted.  This one is dull and uninteresting.  However, I do like the Mickie James and Trish Stratus chemistry.
""3 out of 10""

3) JBL vs. The Boogeyman
---The Boogeyman has had 2 months to shock, taunt, and frighten the WWE audience.  I really look forward to this guy, but this was the chance for JBL to have some fun, and for The Boogeyman to prove whether he can deliver a good match or not.  I don't ask for technical poetry-in-motion, but why not give us more?  Carlito isn't a great athlete yet, either, but he has fun with his matches and uses his character to enhance the expierence.  The Boogeyman's work is too easy, and JBL's status as the ""Wrestling God"" is looking hazy.  This one isn't boring, but PPVs deserve longer contests than this 4-minute letdown.
""5 out of 10""

4) 30-Man Royal Rumble
---I'm surprised this wasn't the Main Event, but it actually gives more respect and depth to the title matches, so I don't mind.  I hope the backstage shenanigans aren't a tradition for the Royal Rumble, because they give away the potential winners.  This Royal Rumble isn't bad, but it's disappointing.  Where's the humor, or the suspense, or the finishing moves, or the wrestling for that matter?  This Royal Rumble goes back to the basics of punching, kicking, and near-eliminations.  Honestly, there was very little ""wrestling"" in this match.  Look at the 2003 match, where there were lots of laughs and hard-hitting manuevers.  Look at the 2005 match, where the inter-brand suspense was at an all-time high.  Look at the 1997 match, where jobbers still gave us a good show and made future starts look god.  This one is unoriginal until the closing minutes, and those minutes aren't a stroke of genius.  The twist with Shawn Michaels is excellent, but even Mysterio's victory moment is shamefully ruined by his lack of participation, not to mention Randy Orton's procrastination.  I must admit that I enjoyed this match, but one viewing is plenty for me.
""7 out of 10""

5) WWE Championship
John Cena vs. Edge (champion)
---The ""New Year's Revolution 2006"" twist was genius, the crowd loyalty switch was nice build-up, the undeniable charisma of both Edge and Cena really got me hoping, and the flashy entrance of John Cena with his steel catwalk was a fantastic touch.  But you will soon realize that it's all a sham, just like Cena's title win at ""WrestleMania 21"".  Cena proved to me at ""Vengeance 2005"" and ""SummerSlam 2005"" than he can still wrestle, but I'm tired of waiting.  This match is slow and a real cheapshot to the WWE fans.  Edge sometimes can't decide what kind of a wrestler he is, and here he can't make being in control an entertaining part of a match.  John Cena has officially pissed me off.  Honestly, where is the fun in having Edge kick Cena's ass for 7 minutes, and then having Cena hulk up and win within 4 more minutes?  This match is crap.  I've survived some painful train wrecks before...Lesnar/Goldberg at ""WrestleMania XX"", Batista/JBL at ""Great American Bash 2005"", any of Hulk Hogan's WCW matches, any of the WWF/WWE's attempt at boxing...believe me when I say that I've strengthened my appreciation for some well-written scripts gone bad.  But this is an insult to the WWE fans because it started with some flashy smoke-and-mirrors tricks, but then tried to tell us that we didn't need to see a good match in order to buy that John Cena is our champ.  Joey Styles and Jerry Lawler should be ashamed of exclaiming ""This one's going to be fantastic"", ""What a match"", and ""The Champ is here""!  Very rarely does a match anger me so much!
""1 out of 10""

6) World Heavyweight Championship
Mark Henry vs. Kurt Angle (champion)
---I was actually looking forward to this one, and it's not that bad.  Mark Henry truly has a dominating presence, and Kurt Angle plays a nice role because he has to used his wits more than his technical prowess.  Kurt Angle is one of the few small guys who give us a good match against bigger athletes.  Mark Henry is a powerful machine, and I eagerly await more of his matches.  The twist at the end with The Undertaker's display of power with pyrotechnics (the ring collapse is a great touch!) is very nice.  So why not a higher grade?  The Henry/Angle match is just too short.  It's the best one of the night, but I believe that Angle and Henry had a classic on their hands, but were too eager to start promoting The Undertaker's quest for the gold, or too eager to quick-fix Batista's sudden departure.  I like this match, but it could've been so much more!
""7 out of 10""

OVERALL
---I cannot believe what I've just witnessed.  I honestly cannot play devil's advocate for this one.  The physical wrestling is just not that good in so many areas.  If John Cena was my favorite wrestler, I'd still be bored by watching him give that kind of performance.  If Rey Mysterio were my favorite, I still would have no clue that he deserved to win the Royal Rumble match.  Six cruiserweight could've showcased an awesome high-risk clinic, but instead gave us one of the most basic Tornado matches I've ever seen.  Mickie James and Trish Stratus thankfully still have a good storyline on their hands, but Ashley still bores me to death.  And The Boogeyman better start wrestling, or ""SmackDown"" will never escape it's mostly-popular title of second-best.  Kurt Angle and The Undertaker will certainly give us a show for the ages, and I look forward to seeing Rey Mysterio's career develop.  But this PPV is best looked at through flashbacks and sound bites.  In short, it just plain sucks.",1138579200,3,7443,4.673846153846154
2476038,3,B000DZID74,"I just finished watching the PPV, And all i have to say is that it really wasn't that good at all. I mean by order i'll tell you what i think about the matches.

Paul London, Nuncio, Funaki, Kid Kash, Gregory Helmes, And Chris Noble: This was for the Cruiserweight Championship, And this match was pretty entertaining for such young competitors. They all showed some nice athletic moves. 7/10. Winner:""Gregory Helmes"".

Mickee James Vs. Ashley: This is the only reason why i hate wrestling these days: ""Women Matches"". Women matches bore me out, And this one was annoying, And pathetic to watch especially when Mickee has a crush with trish as a special guest referee everytime when she was beating up ashley. 0/10. Winner:""Mickee James"".

JBL Vs. The Boogieman: For a second there i thought this match was going to be entertaining, But again it wasn't, this match didn't even last 8 Minutes. All that you saw in this match was JBL running away like a pansy, And Boogieman having a good time chewing up his worms. 2/10. Winner:""The Boogieman"".

Royal Rumble Battle Royal Event: Wow for a moment there i thought ether RVD, Randy Orton, HHH, Was going to win the RR, And it turns out that Rey Mysterio won the RR. I mean John Cena Vs. Rey Mysterio in the WM22, Thats not really a good main event to put out in the business of WWE, It's kind of lame. I would of rather perfer RVD, HHH, Or Randy Vs. John Cena at the main event at WW22, But it turned out it didn't. 6/10. Winner.""Rey Mysterio"".

Edge Vs. John Cena: WWE Championship Title: This match was pretty decent. But at sometimes i just said to myself if this was going to be a really good match. Well for a second this match was the only good single match in the PPV, The rest was just lame as hell, And the entrance by John Cena was pretty cool with the bridge coming down from the air, And JC stepping with his foot on the floor panels that throw a confetti. 6/10. Winner:""John Cena"".

Mark Henry Vs. Kurt Angle: WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Wow all i have to say is that this match was just way to sloppy to watch. All their was to see is when Mark Henry bear hugging the crap out of Kurt Angle, And then like always ""Boom"" ref goes down as well as Mark Henry, And Kurt angle get's a chair hit's him, Angle Slam, A Pin, Ding Ding Ding your winner Kurt Angle. What a match to see ladie's And germs. And then suddenly: ""Dong"" Undertaker comes out in his wagon, And starts making signals to Kurt Angle about wanting to get a shot at the WWE Heavyweight Title. So then Undertaker lift's his hand up, And then Explosion from the top of the ring. Then you think is over but it isn't, And then Undertaker put's his hands down, And suddenly 4 Lightings strike each of the top corners of the ring, And this has to be one of my favorite ending's to a PPV. Then every seems calm untill the the the rope's snap, And the ring goes down, which was freaking awesome, And that was the only reason why it saved this match. 5/10. Winner:""Kurt Angle"".

Well their you have it, A review about the RR PPV. In my opinion this is not worth buying on dvd, Or not even worth renting it. This has to be the worst Royal Rumble of the 2000's.",1138492800,,3178,4.34006734006734
2476039,2,B000DZID74,"Well i just got finished watching the 2006 Royal Rumble, and I must say this is and was the worst royal Rumble of all time. First off you have a 6 man match nobody cares about, 2nd you have a retarted women's match that are always sickening to watch. Then you have the boogeyman and JBL...gets no worse then that right? WRONG. the royal rumbele match itself was a joke it had the worst wrestlers of all time. I think they called a few people like Tatanka and Animal from LOD to come in for one more match and if they didn't die they would get paid a little money. If thats not bad enough you have a sorry ass midgit with no talen by the name of Rey Mysterio win the rumble?...My god and yes it gets even more retched. Then u have John Cena that cant rap or sing win the title back. Then Mark Henry and Kurt Angle. I love Kurt Angle and he can make anybody look good hes in the ring with, but not your fat worthless reject. Mark Henry sucks and this match itself sucked. You can only do so much with such a terriblr wrestler.

Then you have Granddad come out at the end of the show, Oh i mean Undertaker and collapse the ring with his ""ungodly powers"" and set off fireworks.

1) Vince screws HBK out of the Rumble match and so it will set up HBK vs Vince at Wrestlemania 22

OR

2) Vince uses HBK's old nemisis Bret Hart who makes his return in the Royal Rumble match and takes out HBK to set up for HBk vs Bret Hart for Wrestlemania 22

Luckily, these have been sparse, few and far between, and not always the same in each rumble.  This Rumble had every one of those bad aspects in it all at once.  So mediocre so that it wasn't even the main event!

Cruiserweight Invitational
Kid Kash (C) vs Jamie Noble vs Funaki vs Paul London vs Nunzio vs Gregory Helms
This was the only good match of the PPV.  Whoever does the booking for the cruiserweights must be a veteran of the Monday Night Wars, because they know how to put on great WWF caliber matches.  Everything was just about on in this match.  (9/10)

Ashley Massaro vs Mickie James
It isn't enough that the Women's division in the WWE is little more than eye candy and catfighting, but this was a terrible match up that had all the makings of that Jackie Gayda match J.R. classically claimed had ""bowling shoe tendencies"".  Greener than a freshly grown lawn, Ashley botched a lot of her moves, and just plain fumbled the rest.  Thankfully Mickie James put her down like a dog.  (0/10)

John Bradshaw Layfield vs The Boogeyman
There's only 5 non-Rumble matches on the card, and Smackdown wastes our time and money with this?  Even worse is how seriously people take The Boogeyman's ridiculous gimmick!  If they had tried that ten years ago, ratings would plummet, and WCW would have a goldmine of mocking material.  I would honestly prefer Gobbledygooker over The Boogeyman.  At least the Gobbledygooker could flip and roll around.  The Boogeyman is nothing.  (0/10)

Royal Rumble Match
As I had mentioned before, this rumble was the culmination of all the negative aspects of the Rumble all mashed up into one.  It started out with Rey Mysterio and Triple H doing some good wrestling on each other.  Then as soon as the third person came out, Mysterio was exhausted and flopping around limply as if he were in for an hour.  The next 30 minutes consisted of Triple H fighting it out with most of the other superstars, and superstars being gradually eliminated until it was only Triple H and Mysterio in the ring at once.  Most of the eliminations occured in precisely 90 seconds, lasting only long enough for Triple H to beat on them and eliminate them.  Chris Benoit, for one, considered one of the best technical wrestlers of his day, was literally reduced to ""Five moves of doom"" wrestling, as all he ever did was kick, punch, german suplex, and Crippler Crossface the entire time he was in the Rumble.

The last 30 minutes consisted of more and more superstars piling up with only about three or four eliminations, while the ring got stuffed with superstars.  Mysterio is still flopping about half-dead, occasionally on his feet, even rarer still, doing some actual fighting.  Finally when the last superstar comes out, people start getting quickly eliminated one by one until it's the final four fighting it out.

Unlike the other rumbles, this one had no surprises, and no different phases of combat in the ring (like the 2000 Rumble had a period of Rikishi's dominance, the 2001 Rumble had a period of hardcore as Raven brought weapons in, etc), simply 1-30 minutes: Nearly empty ring,  30-62 minutes: Nearly full ring.  (0/10)

WWE Championship
John Cena vs Edge (C)
This match should have taken place before the Rumble.  As with any Cena match, Cena did little but act tuff, showing off his muscles with bulging veins coursing everywhere, move stiffly, and wrestle---wait, he doesn't wrestle---pretend to fight Edge, who shamefully jobbed to that pathetic nothing who went on to reign on and off for most of 2006, and then reign all throughout 2007 undefeated as of the day this review was written.  (0/10)

World Heavyweight Championship
Kurt Angle (C) vs Mark Henry
This match should have taken place before the Rumble.  Better yet, this match shouldn't have taken place at all.  Mark Henry is like John Cena, in that he cannot wrestle, but unlike Cena, he also cannot move.  He can barely run as much as he shuffles about and hugs people to death.  I believe the wrestling term ""Immovable Object"" or ""Fat Untalented Piece of Crap"" was made just for people like Henry, and it made this match all the poorer.  Angle had little to work with but fat hulk that kept trying to smash him with hugs and punches, and it all came out as dismal as any WWE match featuring untrained muscled men who are more meatbags than athletes.  (0/10)

Kurt Angle cut a good promo, but he might as well have been wrestling an elephant. Mark Henry is like a million dollar albatross around the WWE's neck. He's only in the company because of McMahon's fetish for big men. Cena vs. Edge was a reasonably interesting match, but it was much too short.

I can't even remember who else wrestled who on the card. There was a women's bout and it was pretty weak. The cruiserweight tournament was a mess. 2006 in general did not shape up to be one of WWE's better pay per view years. If you want to see some good pay per views, check on some of the titles from 2005:
