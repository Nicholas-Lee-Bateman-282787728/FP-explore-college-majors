8520642,5,B007PSYRWW,Hard to give 5 stars with that ending (see for yourself). Must be just as difficult for a straight man to love a gay man as a gay man to love a straight man. Both roads lead to pain. Move is relatable and I think well written and directed. Makes me miss my straight friend who loved me but we could not be together. I could not see him marry and have kids and he could not see me move on to a lessor love than he.,1505088000,,413,3.7586206896551726
8520643,5,B007PSYRWW,"Two men come together, one gay and the other straight.  Ivan, a gay man extends his love to Windson, a straight man, who reciprocates as a best friend and no more.  Thus sets the drama of a lifetime.  The movie starts much earlier showing life in China in the mid-1900's in black emphasizing the importance of family relations and the fear of separation at death.  Time moves contemporary and changes to color.  The gay man is a financial success, yet alone.  He meets the straight man that he realizes is his love of life.  The movie continues with family members passing on, more questions of death and separation.  In the end we all die, yet we live on in the memories of others.  An incredible powerful movie.  Male nudity happens to show a beautiful friendship between men.  An incredible illustration that gay and straight men can be friends for life, that men can be naked together as friends, and that love transcends family and time.  Pleased this is part of my collection.  Planning to add more of the directors works.",1400803200,,1028,4.644444444444445
8520644,5,B007PSYRWW,"""Permanent Residence"" is the first film in a trilogy by Scud.  The second film is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scud-s-Amphetamine/dp/B007PRZHYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scud's Amphetamine</a>, and third installment is ""Life of an Artist"" and is not yet released.  My first encounter with Scud's work was ""Amphetamine.""  I was so impressed with it that seeing the first film became a pressing need.  In my opinion, ""Amphetamine"" is a work of genius, and with the viewing of ""Permanent Residence,"" I am still of an opinion that Scud is a cut above the average film maker.

Usually classed with the avant-garde film makers, Scud apparently earns this categorization for his single minded devotion to the promotion of homosexuality, beautifully shot nude scenes, and a stubborn adherence to his artistic principles.  You will find in ""Permanent Residence"" and ""Amphetamine"" all these elements, but there is much more to his films than eye candy and sexual politics, and I think this is where the true genius of Scud shines and truly makes him avant-garde.  Scud's films seem to operate on two levels:  A narrative of social concerns and personal relationships enhanced by outstanding cinematography, and a deeper symbolic and philosophical level revealing a depth of meaning that is not simply edifying but geared to transform the viewer.

While ""Permanent Residence"" advances liberal and progressive ideas, Scud's promotion of homosexuality is done in concert with very traditional Chinese social norms.  Scud promotes marriage as an enviable goal for the structuring of relationships.  Marriage is not depicted as an antiquated and meaningless institution to be overrun by more carefree and less restrictive mores.  Family, filial piety, ""adopted brother"" relationships, extended family, care of the sick and old, religion, and education have positive and supporting place in Scud's narrative.  Scud's cutting edge is well sheathed in old leather.

Assuming you are not blinded by the many skinny dipping scenes in this film,  Scud's real cutting edge artistry is found  in his use of signs and symbolic language revealing religious and philosophical ideas.  Often the odd quirky moments in the film function as hints to deeper intentions.  Do not write them off as poor editing.  Other symbols are more obvious--if you know what to look for.

I could detail the deeper meaninings in this film, but that would make this review horribly long and possibly discourage the reader from viewing it, and I would not want to do that.  But I will try to give a few crucial examples.  Scud places much emphasis on time, memory, and ""life as a journey"" in this movie, including within his scope the afterlife, a concept he uses to encompass much of the narrative.  The early purchase of a large quantity of expensive journals by Ivan (played by Li) seems somewhat commonplace, but Scud uses them to promote his sense of time and journey, even writing into them a sense of the future.  A later reference to the Chinese philosoher Li Ao is an odd somewhat intrusive interruption in the narrative, but if you know that Li Ao is the first credited writer of the travel diary in Chinese literature, the gist of what he is doing takes on greater meaning and depth.  It is a good example of Scud's efforts to layer multiple meanings in his films.  So is an odd quirky scene in which Ivan is refused a Catholic burial plot.  Seemingly out of place and irrelevant, the scene only makes sense when contrasted to the narrative's more positive attitude toward Jewish afterlife.  The resurrection motif in Judaism is based on the relationship of Elijah and Elisha in which spirit sharing occurs upon Elijah's fiery assent into heaven.  In a sense, a soul-mate relationship that Scud can relate to his two principal characters, Ivan and Windson.  In both ""Amphetamine"" and ""Permanent Residence"" the prospective lovers have complementary but conflicting relationships that become a part of Scud's symbolic language.  In this case, Ivan and Windson represent the hun and po souls of traditional Chinese anthropology.  Ivan is depicted as the higher hun soul with intellectual and spiritual interests symbolized by water, while Windson is associated with the po soul expressed through simplicity, body, and earth.  Integrating the two is an important part of Chinese spirituality, and their completeness in Ivan and Windson is later depicted through marriage, separation, role reversal, and ultimately in death awaiting happiness in a future life.  Scud is very crafty at expressing deeper things in his films, and these are only a few examples that make his work fascinating and uplifting.  If you want to see something truly different in a movie, purchasing Scud's films are a good place to find satisfaction.",1359849600,4,4829,5.243489583333333
