4313051,3,B004B3S9Y6,"We grew up during the Elvis era and are huge fans to this day. We felt the movie was repetitive and the quality of the video was poor. We also felt the content to be propaganda driven. We love and admire Elvis but this was overkill and for the most part boring. Given the ratings we expected better, will be returning for a refund.",1445299200,4,331,4.1875
