Satan grants them wealth and youth for sacrificing a blood relative, of which there has been a lot of as late  and always young attractive women. The film centers around Alexandra Parkman (Christine Moore) who is connected to all the missing people and victims. The dialog is corny and at times amusingly sexual. It is from the 80's and I love their hair style.

Not a great film as the plot lacks complexity.

7891086,4,6305538409,"A group of diabolical cultists have been operating underneath the nose of the Catholic Church for centuries, even within the bowels of a cathedral. To those so inclined, a pact with The Devil is made every thirteen years to ensure immortality, at the cost of a relative offered as a sacrifice*. Of note, the first 'offering' is very lovely, and is an utter waste. Such a beauty should be enjoyed, not destroyed.

The presiding black priest Thomas Seaton has set his evil eye on the alluring Alexandra, who happens to be engaged to be married. Due to his persistent meddling, her preppie fiance meets a sudden fate, while her drunken mother perishes through excessive compulsion.

Seaton uses both Lesser Magic charm & Greater Magic to manipulate his quarries, as well as employing a brutish henchman who retrieves the necessary flesh for the proceedings, including an obnoxious aerobics-obsessed friend, and a drug-addled prostitute, laying waste to any obstacles who may interfere.

A nun comes calling at The Devil's doorstep, expressing her misgivings with the catholic doctrine and desiring to be numbered amongst the children of darkness - Power instead of weakness, pleasure instead of deprivation. But she must undergo a test of blasphemy first, to affirm her sin-cerity. During her infernal confirmation, she shatters a crucifix with Satan's hammer, but ends up being a lowly traitorous liar.

Two unlikely detectives go snooping through the secret chambers of the cathedral, and are themselves rewarded with wrath.

The ritual chapel features a large rendition of Eliphas Levi's Sabbatic Baphomet, with an altar flanked by two black pillars, reminiscent of a Masonic configuration. During a Black Mass ceremony, an imaginative demonic creature is in attendance, somewhat resembling a red Pazuzu.

The congregants gleefully indulge in one another, while liturgy consists of latin enunciation, of course reminiscent of Le Messe Noir {The Satanic Rituals; ASLV}. Unfortunately, the nun infiltrates the cult, interrupting the rite in what amounts to a dishonorable blindsiding & is justifiably cursed by Seaton. The concluding scene is redolent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Rain/dp/B000GIW964/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Rain</a>. She would of course perish in the fire, while Seaton emerges anew to continue The Devil's work.

Also of note regarding the rituals performed here, the use of flash paper is displayed, Seaton's medallion features the ram-horned Baphomet variation, the fine robes, & the chamber configuration is cause for consideration.

Overall, Prime Evil contains voluptuous nudity, interesting ideas, and pleasing aesthetics. I found it to be an amusing viewing.

My review is only concerned with the entertainment value of the film.

While considering what to write for my review of 'Prime Evil', I tried to think of some positive things to say about it.  I'm still thinking.  Still thinking.

William Beckwith, as Father Seton, plays the leader of a satanic cult hidden within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, a group that purchases power and immortality from Satan by sacrificing a blood relative every thirteen years.  The plot, such as it is, revolves around one member of the cult who is preparing his adult granddaughter for the ceremony, and how she slowly falls into their trap.  But unknown to Father Seton and the rest of the cult members, there is a spy in their midst in the form of a young nun who had run afoul of the cult when she was still a little girl.  Will she be in time to save Alexa, the granddaughter, from the sacrifice?

Trust me, you won't care.  I can accept a movie with a limited budget, cheap sets and bad film quality.  I can accept silly scripts, bad dialogue, and cheesy effects.  Some of those things can actually become positives in B-grade flicks like this, but what I cannot stand, what makes me squirm in my seat, is a preponderance of bad actors.  In low-budget filmmaking, you expect for there to be several actors who are unable to act, but 'Prime Evil' has only one, William Beckwith, that can.  Nothing thrusts me out of the make-believe world of the film faster than leaden, wooden acting.

Here's a positive:  'Prime Evil' positively proves that not just anybody can get up on screen and convincingly portray a character.  I hereby apologize for every crack I've made at the expense of Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise.  I still don't like their movies, but they do have at least some skill at acting.  The cast of 'Prime Evil' make Keanu Reeves and Nicolas Cage look like Richard Burton and John Gielgud in comparison.

Here's another positive:  The DVD cover art is pretty good, if a bit phallic.

I suppose it's my Pentecostal upbringing, but occult movies are not really my thing.  Still, a well-made film is still a well-made film, and a poor one is still poor.  I suppose Roberta Findlay, the director, did what she could with the material and equipment she was given, but the cast she had to direct are as talented as those in the average adult film, which, ironically, is where Ms. Findlay got her directing start.

I'll round this one up, since I was able to watch it all the way through, but just barely.  Another positive - this movie has to have the most cheesy, absolutely silly-looking effects I've ever seen.  It's almost worth a look just for the Prince of Darkness footage - if you were able to somehow skip the other 82 1/2 of the 83 minutes.

One last positive:  This movie makes all the time I waste playing computer solitaire look worthwhile in comparison to the time I spent watching this.",1287273600,4,3230,4.832422586520948
7891089,2,6305538409,"Sometimes, you just want to watch a cheesy horror movie with a ridiculous storyline, lots of bad acting, and such sparkling dialogue as ""Cut the crap, fart breath"" - and when you're in that kind of mood, Prime Evil stands ready to meet all of your lowest expectations.  It even throws in one of the lamest fight scenes in movie history for no extra charge.  This is actually one of the better films from director Roberta Findlay, best known for a string of hardcore pornographic films in the 1970s (she and husband Michael Findlay have been called ""the most notorious filmmakers in the annals of sexploitation"") before turning her attention to making bad horror films in the 1980s.  Now maybe you're thinking Prime Evil must have a fair amount of nudity in it, and it does - but it's all relegated to naked female breasts.

If nothing else (and I do mean nothing else), the main purveyor of all this ""prime evil"" does have charisma, and that's an important thing to have when you're basically Satan's 800-year-old prime minister on Earth.  For all the cheesiness of his role, William Beckwith actually turns in a pretty good performance as ""Father"" Thomas Seaton.  Everyone else - not so much.  Christine Moore is OK as the nave and necessarily virginal Alexandra Parkman, but the rest of the cast would, as I like to say, have a hard time acting their way out of a dark room with a flashlight.  Special kudos to the two cops, who actually make Hayden Christensen look like a good actor (well, almost).  As far as the story goes, Alex is fated to be the next sacrificial victim for the local New York parish of Satan.  If you think that sounds like bad news for her - especially since she's being given to Satan by her own grandfather - try being one of her friends.  Father Thomas takes quite a liking to the young lady, and he doesn't want anyone interfering with his plans.

Throw in an undercover nun and a special cameo by Satan himself (looking absolutely ridiculous, I might add) along with little bit of blood and some kooky gore at the end, and you've got Prime Evil.  The whole thing is a complete and utter waste of time - entertaining to lovers of bad movies (such as myself), but a painful ordeal for those born without the bad movie lover gene.",1283212800,,2258,4.545679012345679

7891091,1,6305538409,"Did I mention the fact that this is a Boring movie. I drank 7 beers and watched this movie. Thinking it had potential since it's about satanism and the like. Also it was suppost to have nudity in it but it didn't,at least my copy didn't. It appeared to have had 3 differant scipts of the movie piced together resulting in a big mess. Nothing scary or exciting here except a big waste of your time.",1166832000,4,397,4.2368421052631575
7891092,1,6305538409,"I just finished wasting 80 minutes watching this ""fright"" flick.  It has some nice shots of NYC, but that's about it.  On a scale of 1 - 10,

Skin shown - 1  Horror - 1  Credibility - 1  Acting - 1

I expect a demonic horror film to be frightening, tense, and have some clever twists.  This had none.  The only erotic shot (nothing sexy in the dvd)is on the COVER of the dvd.  The villains were able to kill off a half dozen people without anyone investigating, and apparently no neighbors noticed.  In one scene the boring bad-guy carries a young woman out of a gym wrapped in a sheet without anyone questioning him.  DUM  DUM  MUD  DUM  DUM",1165104000,3,642,4.225
7891093,5,6305538409,"This movie has quite possibly become my favorite horror film of all time. The acting was quite superb, the plot was twisted, and it scared the bejezus out of me. I especially like the part where the former nun takes off her cloth and throws it in the flame(talk about getting rid of a bad habit). Also a great part of the movie was the daemon, it was so realistic, I felt like I was going to descend to hell. If you are into serious horror, then pick this up. If you are a wittle cwybaby who can't stand scawy stuff, then go get a cotton candy mohawk and pick up a Barney video",993081600,14,577,4.0701754385964914
