2604753,4,B000GBT3OW,"The movie is about a girl that falls in love with a man. The man falls in love with the girl. Oh, and there is some very beautifully choreographed fighting. It's not really fighting, but more like dancing. Also, I found this movie quite funny. Namsoon, who is the girl detective that falls in love with the nameless swordsman, is always undercover as a male, so Nameless is quite surprised when he finds that she is a woman; he is also obviously infatuated with her.

The plot is...okay. There's counterfeit money floating around, and the officers/cops are out to flush out whoever is behind it. The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. I hate spoilers, so I won't do that to you. I'll just say that the ending is the most beautiful , yet saddest, part of the movie. It's a happy-not-happy ending.",1250985600,2,811,4.517006802721088
2604754,3,B000GBT3OW,"This movie is ok to watch if you're trying score points with your girl but by yourself this movie is a love story plain and simple. There's action (mostly cgi), there's some comedy but still its a love story plus this movie shows too many flashbacks! You'll be confused after the first 45 minutes! The movie is only good to watch if you're with a loved one but if your with a friend skip it unless you have respect for Korean movies! Only under that logic watch it.",1239667200,,465,4.295454545454546
2604755,4,B000GBT3OW,"This Korean film is a strange one to commend. The lead actress -- altho very appealing -- mugs and overacts from start to finish -- altho that seems to have been the director's idea*. The comedy, what there is, is often at the Hong Kong level. The martial arts scenes are Asian standard. Yet I found the film totally engrossing.

Visually it was one of the most daring and stunning that I've seen. It's the direction, cinematography and the pacing that made the drama work despite all the questionable elements mentioned earlier. They imbue the story with a lyricism that grows as the romantic tension between the advarsaries -- the policewoman and the mysterious swordsman -- grows. The effort to find and thwart the counterfeiter whose coinage is destabalizing the kingdom is mere background.

Korean filmmaker Lee Myung-se falls into the auteur category that includes such individual talents as Hitchcock, Jean-Pierre Melville, Wong Kar Wai and Ozu -- controlling the various facets of production in an effort to bring his vision to the screen. He may be hard on the production's underlings, but the result can often be spectacular. This one is.

The multitude of extras that come with the 3-DVD Region 3 set are almost all without English subtitles. The exception is the lengthy documentary on disk 3. It not only goes behinds the scenes of this film but gives us insight into the driven Lee Myung-se.

* The actress, Ha Ji Won, gave a more naturalistic but equally winning performance in the Korean TV mini-series of this story broadcast a couple years earlier: (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DAMO-The-Undercover-Lady-Detective/dp/B0007TO8TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DAMO: The Undercover Lady Detective</a>)

2604756,1,B000GBT3OW,"It's one of the bad Korean Fantasy movies. The fighting is worthless. The plot is incoherent and nonsense.

I prefer the Warrior, and Shadowless Sword.",1217030400,,151,5.04
2604757,5,B000GBT3OW,"this was great! it had a definite individuality to it. it had some comedy (very little) that actually worked in a really great way for it. the characters didn't say a lot but you still seemed to guess the story of there lives. it had a great tone and fantastic music. the instruments used in it were so out of the ordinary for a wushu film but it worked wonderfully. there is one scene with a french accordion that worked so well. the fight scenes are really cool. the visuals are the best. to tell the truth, i hated this film the first time i saw it. mostly because i was expecting more of a classic wushu film. but once that passed i really enjoyed this movie and it's now one of my favorites. the love story is great. there is a relationship that develops between the two main characters. it begins with detective namsoon (the girl) trying to follow him and try to make an arrest. it than goes to a fight scene in an alleyway where a dark shadow takes up half of it. its so cool how they use that. but as the story progresses we se this relationship come together and it worked wonderfully. a new innovative and great film that trys to reinvent everything in film.",1211155200,2,1168,4.289592760180995
2604758,4,B000GBT3OW,"Honestly, the male lead looks like a woman in drag.

I found it quite perplexing, enjoying the growth of the romance between the two lead characters and wondering if it was going to turn out to be a Lesbian relationship - which, in my opinion, would have been a twist that actually would have improved the movie.

Its visually stunning if a little improbable. People just aren't able to earnestly fight each other for that long without someone getting cut up. Not that that's something one thinks of with most chambara-esque type movies - but the female cop here is so obviously outclassed in the fight that you wonder if the male (?) lead is in fact just playing with her. And its only that thought which makes you suspect he'd rather dance with her than kill her.",1198454400,2,765,4.536231884057971
2604759,4,B000GBT3OW,"I should say first that before I saw The Duelist, I gathered from reviews that the visuals were the most important thing about the movie.  This is very true and if you go into this movie expecting a deep plot or a character-driven story, you will be sadly disappointed.  If you go in expecting some kind of spiritual allegory, I suppose you can squeeze something out but, really, this movie is all about feasting your eyes.  The movie has deep flaws but it also has formidable strengths.

The sum of my opinion:

The first twenty minutes were the most dreadful thing I have ever seen in my life.

The last twenty minutes was the most sublime movie time I have enjoyed in a long while.

At first, the movie seems like it is straining for effect, it doesn't know what it wants to be.  Once our lady detective heroine begins her pursuit of assassin Sad Eyes, the movie picks up considerably.

The relationship between the leads is almost wordless.  We have a pretty man and a macho woman who consider mortal combat to be the ultimate expression of love.  Would this work in real life?  Of course not!  This is a sword fantasy.  Remember, we are here for the visuals!  If gorgeously choreographed battles between beautiful people are not your cup of tea, do yourself a favor and watch something else.  Watching the movie and complaining that the love story is unrealistic is like seeing Transformers and complaining that giant robots do not exist.  If you want a realistic love story, a sword-fighting movie probably isn't the place to find it anyway, LOL!

Would I recommend The Duelist?  With reservations.  As I said, I hated the opening with a passion and almost stopped watching.  I don't know if I am alone in this but it is something to keep in mind.  I think I would recommend it to chambara geeks, K-culture fans and people who just enjoy a beautiful movie. If you have a problem with very strong female leads (admittedly hammy in this case), find something else.  If you have a problem with untraditional romances, find something else.

Keep in mind, you will not find a more visually stunning movie.  Just park your inhibitions at the door and don't try to make sense of the plot and characters.  View it as a string of unrelated drances and you will enjoy it all much more.  Have fun and give your eyes a treat!

So here is the breakdown:

Movie 4/5
Visuals 5/5
Music 5/5
Plot 2/5",1191024000,13,2388,4.539906103286385
2604760,5,B000GBT3OW,"This was a beautiful movie.  I think a lot of people who dislike this film miss a lot of points as many things are left unsaid.  Kang Dong-Won plays beautifully in this movie and Ha Ji won is perfect in this film as well(I loved the faces she made, they were adorable!).  In no way are their gender reversals perverted nor do they overpower the film.  These are two opposite characters with one definite similarity and that is they solve things through action.  Detective Nam Sun (Ha Ji won) solves her problems through fighting and Sad eyes seemed to be brought up simply as a killing machine. Their fighting scenes with each other--especially one in particular-have a lot of emotion to them like a couple arguing.  They are also on opposite sides of the law which creates another problem.

I enjoyed the plot line and felt the movie held a complete story.  Although, it seemed there were a few times when the movie raced over certain details leaving you to fill in the blanks yourself.  Great movie. Great soundtrack.  Great actors.",1174521600,5,1034,4.662983425414365
