8601854,4,B00E688Z5E,"I am partial to old cowboy movies. I like John Wayne flicks. Monte Walsh, on the other hand, is a story about what occurs in the lives of ordinary people when the basic conditions of their lifestyle change, and not always for the better.",1527379200,,237,4.409090909090909
8601855,5,B00E688Z5E,"Monte Walsh with Lee Marvin is a most poignant Western.  Lee Marvin was a hero on Guadalcanal and his combat veteran status makes the portrayal of the 'veteran' cowboy Monte Walsh even better.

Like most older Westerns, Rio Lobo is melodramatic though I still enjoy watching it.  However, I prefer John Wayne's later Westerns like Rio Bravo and El Dorado.",1497484800,,355,4.883333333333334
