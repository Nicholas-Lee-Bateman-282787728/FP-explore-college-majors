4519337,5,B00513UN1W,Jack London's Classic! Not as good as the book tho!,1519430400,,51,4.2
4519338,1,B00513UN1W,"The actors mumble, jabber at double-speed and slur the dialogue continuously.

Director and actors are oblivious to the fact that the viewer hasn't even seen the script, let alone study it.

It's three (3) hours long and just one more reading assignment - without the subtitles on, at least 90 per cent of the dialogue would be unintelligible. I quite at 40 minutes.

The package contains two discs, with 90 minutes of the movie on each plus a 10 minute 'extra' on the making of.",1491177600,2,479,4.6117647058823525
4519339,2,B00513UN1W,just ok,1466640000,,7,3.0
4519340,1,B00513UN1W,"The CDS...doesn't appear to be in English; either way, I can't tell. It's completely black and won't advance to the movie. FRAUD",1425772800,,128,4.863636363636363
4519341,3,B00513UN1W,"I read Jack Londons The Sea Wolf twice great book the character development between Wolf Larson and Humphrey (Hump) keeps you on the edge of you seat. The movie was pretty good, but as in all movies made from such a good book its difficult to capture every little details of the characters. If you read the book you will like the movie ok. If you see the movie I recommend reading the book.",1371513600,6,390,4.283783783783784
4519342,5,B00513UN1W,I rented this movie previously and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to own the dvd.  Great movie and I got what I expected.  The dvd arrived in excellent condition.  I've already watched it once and am very satisfied with the quality of the dvd.,1364342400,2,245,4.282608695652174
4519343,4,B00513UN1W,"I didn't expect that a movie version could possibly do justice to what is essentially a philosophical/allegorical story. But as I loved this book after recently reading it (finally, at the age of 33) I really wanted to see how the characters and story would be portrayed. Certainly, much of the real philosophical bent to the story is absent here; it simply doesn't translate to the screen. But for someone who enjoyed the book and liked the characters, it will please, I think. I enjoyed Sebastian Koch's portrayal of Wolf Larson especially. He was perfect, all the way down to his Norwegian accent and the wolfish leer in his eyes. In the interests of time, the debates between Van Wyden and Larson that are so key to the narrative of the book are mostly missing, and Van Wyden gives in and comes around much too quickly. But again, I didn't expect it would be tackled extensively. Neve Campbell is beautiful as Maude (does she ever age?!) and the supporting cast are all convincing. The odd addition of the subplot involving Larson's brother, ""Death"", is strange at first, though it makes some sense.",1333065600,4,1103,4.75
8452231,4,B00513UN1W,"Film makers interpret a work differently for film than someone's imagination reading a book. So any creation that travels through more than the original writer/creator will be different. I enjoyed this movie, the acting was spot-on. For those that considered it ""mumbling"" I suggest you turn on the closed-captions. It was entertaining and dramatic with the three primary parts ""well played"". If you enjoy the literary classic stories this should be a ""win"" for you, just keep an open mind about ""adapted"" works.",1527724800,,512,5.180722891566265
8452232,2,B00513UN1W,"Part I was fascinating.
Part II the editing was all jacked up. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!  Smack in the middle of the video it cuts out and begins playing a recap of Part I and the subtitles (which are mandatory because much of the dialog is mumbly) are all out of sync and not related to ANYTHING being spoken in the present moment. So....F**** it. Cannot watch any further.",1527206400,,373,4.567164179104478
8452233,5,B00513UN1W,"Sebastian Koch is perfect! Survival of the strong, tempered in great questions about life.  Purely wonderful, heart and soul gripping....I didn't want it to end.",1526342400,,161,5.44
8452234,3,B00513UN1W,Classic story but poorly trained actors. Mumbly. Had to use subtitles but they seem machine generated.  I was watching Jericho this AM and could understand all those actors!!!,1525564800,,175,5.25
8452235,5,B00513UN1W,Great philosophical and psychological study. Deep and thought provoking. I was riveted. Emotional and moving. Highly recommended!,1525564800,,129,6.647058823529412
8452236,1,B00513UN1W,"Sad and brutal, not worth the time or emotional investment.",1525392000,,59,5.0
8452237,5,B00513UN1W,"Life aboard a schooner... Seafarers are a strong passionate breed and shaped history and character. Sailing schooners were in fact used to kill seals- as this was a brutal lesson in human flaws and power, portrayed within the realm of this awesome  nautical adventure. The death of sailing ships in commerce was my take on this masterfully produced story on rugged seamanship and savagery. A great video for passionate seamen or armchair sailors.",1524528000,2,446,5.109589041095891
8452238,4,B00513UN1W,Fascinating story and characters.  I especially liked Neve Campbell.,1523750400,,68,6.555555555555555
8452239,3,B00513UN1W,"Certainly not HD. CC is screwed up beyond the ability to use.
I like the program. Presentation sucks.",1523145600,,101,4.666666666666667
8452240,3,B00513UN1W,"It's been many years since I read the book, so I'm not sure how true the movie is to the story created by Jack London. I did like the characters in the movie and the actors that portrayed them. The two brothers are a real study in what your childhood does to you or for you throughout your adult life. WARNING if you don't know the story, the animal killings are horrific.  I was not too impressed by the lead female character, but she turned out to be a real help in the end.

All in all, I think this is a good sea story amidst a psychological study of two seamen. I found it very interesting and thought provoking.",1523059200,,617,4.133333333333334
