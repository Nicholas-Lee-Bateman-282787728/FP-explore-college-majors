7876058,4,6304636962,"P>...The movie is great because of the intensity of the determination the SS organization had back in the 30's. The actors are great and the music is unique. What is sad about the end of that movie is the same pitfall as other movies. Too much emphasis on concentration camps. In good objectivity, anyone that talks about concentration camps should also learn about the causes of the creation of the SA and the SS. The Germany of 1880 until 1933. This is the period to learn and read about. Stay objective and be a good judge. Like in the movie:""Who needs a revolution, when the revolution already been achieved?""",1014854400,10,613,4.63302752293578
7876059,5,6304636962,"This fictional dramatization of the life of a typical middle class German family and the effects of the third reich and Adolf Hitlers 12 year reign of terror, does an excellent job in humanizing what must have been a horrile dilhemma for German people in the 30s and 40s.  David Warner is terrific as the heartless Reinhardt Heydrich whose influence on the oldest son in the family changed the boy from skeptic and cynic into fulfledged believer.  Tony Randall is also excellent as a ""Joel Grey"" type emcee at the local Night Club who dares to criticise the NAZIS and pays the ultimate price for his performances.  All in all the performances are believable if you can get past some of the heavy British accents which are mixed in with bland American accents like that of Carrol Baker who plays the mom.  The sharp contrast in accents is kind of distracting.",1009497600,5,858,4.662251655629139
7876060,4,6304636962,I have viewed this title a few times. I think this is an excellent movie. Many movies from the World War II era commonly tell a small portion about the people's lives in NAZI Germany during the Third Reich. This movie  collected all the bits and pieces and showed how different people from the  start had their lives affected throughout this time. This is an excellent  movie and I wish it received more publicity to exploit what it does best...  inform people about life in the Third Reich. It also shows the innocence of  the German people and how they were brainwashed and tricked by the NAZIS.  Clearly documenting the civilians at this time.,937785600,21,646,4.62280701754386
