2934019,5,B000V9KEQA,"The movie is Derby and it has my brothers Mike and Butch ,as well as my sister-in-law Christina and my father ( who was in the hospital at the time recovering from the many ailments he suffered in his later years ). The story is about Mike wanting to join the roller derby and the many trials and tribulations he had to face to get there. If you like to look at what we would now call the ""good ol days"" and reminice about the early and turbulent 70's , then this movie is a dandy! It also shed light on the situations and travels of the roller derby people like Charlie O'Connell, Ann Calvello and Eddie Krebs. It is a great little documentary and it did win a few regional awards. Get the movie, sit back and enjoy the retro times of yore !!",1277337600,5,743,4.13103448275862
2934020,5,B000V9KEQA,This is one of my favorite movies as I am a romantic and a horse lover. I had recorded this movie when it aired on TV and lost this movie in 2008 when my home flooded....I've been looking for this movie ever since!,1269302400,2,214,4.0
2934021,5,B000V9KEQA,Derby is a great documentary. As a derby fan and wannabe skater I loved the action shots of the game. The scenes in the locker rooms with the skaters are very revealing. It appears that the skaters don't know that they are being filmed. The story of Mike Snell wanting to break into the Derby is fascinating but sometimes uncomfortable to watch. You could not write characters that are documented in this movie. Very simple small town people. This was filmed in 1970 but is as fascinating and entertaining today. Highly recommended.,1246406400,3,532,4.793478260869565
2934022,5,B000V9KEQA,"John Black written review pretty much sums it all up!  The scenes of Roller Derby really bring back memories to every banked track fan!  I read so much about this film that after having to wait almost half my life to get to view it finally, it was well worth the wait!  A must for any Roller Derby memorabilia collector.  Great adittion to any library with related Roller Derby material be it book or movie.",1239494400,3,407,4.386666666666667
2934023,4,B000V9KEQA,"It's great to have this rare documentary look at Roller Derby in the late 1960's finally arrive on DVD.  The period of 1969-1973 was the last ""golden age"" of Roller Derby, and this film does a good job of capturing that world.  There's a lot of vintage skating on display featuring the San Francisco Bombers, Northwest Cardinals, Northeast Braves and Midwest Pioneers.  The film is also a portrait of a young would-be skater, Mike Snell, whose dream is to enter the Derby.  His lifestyle is less than exemplary, and this documentary examines him warts-and-all.

The DVD is full frame, as it was originally photographed.  The disc includes two audio commentary tracks, one with director Robert Kaylor and the other with producer William Richert.  Both of them are entertaining, although each man makes some mistakes in identifying certain skaters.  Kaylor is more interested in the Derby as a microcosm of society, while Richert is more intrigued by the entertainment aspects and the skill of the athletes.  The disc's image and color is less bright than the long out-of-print VHS release, but the new DVD shows sharper focus.

The film now survives as a time capsule depiction of the dawning of the 1970's.  Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but surprisingly truthful about the ""American Dream.""",1237507200,9,1293,5.05188679245283
2934024,5,B000V9KEQA,I have been waiting a long time to get this movie and it is a very good movie for horse lovers and the romantic.  Very good.,1214092800,5,124,3.769230769230769
2934025,4,B000V9KEQA,"I remember the movie DERBY because my brother Mike Snell was the main character in the movie. He wanted to join the derby and the producer and director thought that would be the perfect plot for the film. Charlie O' was somewhat miffed at that idea but the movie went forward. Looking at it now it seems a bit campy but that's the 70's 4 u. Even after being out over 30 years now it is still an excellent documentary today. When it was released in 71 it was rated R, which is equal to possibly PG or even a mild PG-13 today. I think it can stand the test of time because we all like to get a little retro now and then and the players and fans are still fun to watch in the movie. Get it and get nostalgic.",1090195200,,705,3.971830985915493
2934026,3,B000V9KEQA,"I recently bought this movie because I remember seeing it in its release in 1971. A good biography of roller derby skaters on tour in the late sixties and early seventies. It also shows one mans dream to become a professional skater. Lots of action footage from live games featuring skating legends like Charlie Oconnell, Ken Monte, Ann Calvallo, Bill Groll and many others. This movie is a must see for any diehard roller derby fans that followed it in the sixties during its heyday. If your a true derby fan you will want this movie.",1043625600,4,535,4.583333333333333
8217450,5,B000V9KEQA,"Director/cinematographer Robert Kaylor not only astutely nails the basic human need to rise above one's meager station and make something out of one's life by following one's dreams, but also presents a fascinating exploration of the bleak hand-to-mouth existence of the low middle-class in the early 1970's and how the violent nature of the roller derby sport blatantly panders to the public's base interest in brutal spectacle. The way Kaylor shows the radical contrast between the likable and down-to-earth O'Connell who lives in a fancy home complete with big kidney-shaped pool in California and the smarmy and deceitful Snell's far less glamorous plight residing in a shabby trailer with his long-suffering wife Christina, two kids, and fat'n'lazy deadbeat brother Butch speaks volumes about the fiercely delineated distinction between the haves and the have nots in American society.

Better still, Kaylor provides a wealth of striking and startling moments: O'Connell returning to the park in New York City that he used to skate at as a kid, Snell trying to convince a bank employee to loan him three hundred bucks so he can purchase a motorcycle, Christina confronting one of her unfaithful husband's mistresses and taking the woman to task for waking up her kids by honking her car horn while driving past the Snell home late at night, and one of Snell's friends talking about his experiences fighting overseas in Vietnam. Naturally, there's a good deal of rough'n'tumble roller derby footage, but it's the sly and sneaky manner in which this documentary reveals the sordidly compelling underbelly of everyday blue collar American life and the ruthless extremes some people are willing to resort to in order to make their particular American Dream come true that makes this film such a great gritty little gem.",1523145600,2,1820,5.190476190476191

8217456,5,B000V9KEQA,"This movie is exactly what it looks like, so if you can't quite handle the typical sentimental horse movie, then it probably isn't for you. But for everyone who loves horse movies enough to put up with the sap and heartfelt drama that comes with it, then definitely check this out. It's a fun, clean, family-friendly movie about a girl trying to save her family's horse farm with a temperamental filly, a difficult trainer, a picture perfect fiance, and--of course--the cute stable boy she loved years ago. Anyone who's seen a horse movie will figure the plot out within the first few minutes but the fun with this movie is the ride, not the destination.",1371600000,,654,4.695652173913044

8217458,4,B000V9KEQA,"Released in April 1971 and directed by Robert Kaylor, the docu-drama proved to be revolutionary since it contains all the elements that has worked masterfully on reality television shows that jump into sports/sports-entertainment.

What appears to be a planned documentary on the Roller Derby league veers into another direction when 23 year old Mike Snell appears on the scene to chase a dream of jamming on the track. The cockiness and midnight rambling of the married father of two young children is juxtaposed with legendary skater Charlie O'Donnell of the San Francisco Bay Bombers, whose drive to the top began as a youngster in a New York City park during matches between neighborhood ""teams"" on a circuit around a cast-iron railing. O'Donnell has captured a slice of pop culture fame, but a price is paid through the hard bumps and lengthy coast-to-coast tours. Truly, the strong can only survive this grind.

The end of the ""documentary"" is actually the possible start of Snell's new career, with the cliffhanger fitting the business model of company owner Jerry Seltzer, who placed a premium on live shows over the whole story being easily seen on a screen. There are solid scenes from matches and the flamboyant Ann Calvello proves to be larger-than-life while bending the rules.

The movie tanked at the box office and Seltzer shut down the company in 1973 due to runaway costs caused by oil shortages. But what actually marked the end of one era pointed to another that entertains countless millions on a daily basis.",1299024000,5,1530,4.96875
