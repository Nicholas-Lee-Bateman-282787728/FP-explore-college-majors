King Singers, and Turtle Island String Quartet. If you think that Johann Sebastian was boring, think again. Highly recommended.",1382572800,,274,5.523809523809524
7900067,5,7880711872,"I was extremely fortunate to attended this outdoor concert as well as all of the Bachfest2000, and what a feast of music it was. This video captures the outdoor concert in the square wonderfully, including the periods of rain and the wonderfully attentive crowd, and the taped performances are of highest quality, although I agree with a prior reviewer that the Turtle Island group, while interesting, was a bit hard to take. Bobby McFerrin was terrific as usual, but then again so were everyone else. In addition, I particularly like the Quitessence Saxaphone Quintet and Jacques Louspier. (I was walking through the Market Square the day prior to the concert and heard several of the groups trying out their arrangements and the sound system. What fun Mcferrin and the saxphone group had then, just too bad that it, too, couldn't be on the DVD.) Hey, if you like Bach, or not so much, buy this it's great.",1313884800,,907,4.7834394904458595
