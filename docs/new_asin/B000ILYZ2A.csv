8146511,2,B000ILYZ2A,"The cover shows a wonderful potential for getting into the amazon and watching shamanic works in action.  The reality is a very dry set of lectures in a poorly attended conference room with very amateur quality camera work, speakers talking about items being shown on a white board which never come into frame (use your inner sight?) etc.

The information conveyed is OK for what it is,.. would I recommend this set for someone wanting to delve into the Mystical Secrets of the Amazon and Ayahuasca?.. probably not,.. actually,.. NO.

Maybe best suited to a lecture filler for an alternative reality type classroom setting where folks are not expecting an experience other than lecturer's standing behind a lectern, fielding questions that can't be heard, and continually walking out of frame so that the only thing visible is an empty lectern and a potted plant.

Probably best for those who want to know a bit more about Yage but have not yet acquired much in the way of experience or understanding yet.  The information is probably best aimed at this level.  Get the books written by these folks,.. the information is the same and the presentation is far less ad-lib.",1296604800,5,1170,4.8542713567839195
8146512,5,B000ILYZ2A,"For those who like live presentations about important topics by major authors and experts on a subject, this DVD product delivers. I love recommending products that I care about and I only bother reviewing DVDs I like. Anything else is just a waist of my time. For anyone that really cares about the topic of the Shamanic use of Ayahuasca in the Amazon and the World at large for healing and transformation, this DVD product deserves a spot in your library right next to Shamans of the Amazon, another vital DVD product on this topic. Both of these products offer vital research material for anyone who cares about this subject. For those who are new to this topic, this is the kind of research material you will need to prepare, before you embark on any healing journey using Ayahuasca.",1242518400,3,787,4.669064748201439
8146513,5,B000ILYZ2A,"It's certainly research material.

There is not much else going on than 3 people lecturing...

Great lectures mind you - certainly perfect for 'classroom' setting.",1202601600,2,163,5.48
