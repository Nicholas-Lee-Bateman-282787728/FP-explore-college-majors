8621810,5,B00GB0OWSE,"This is an updated cover (and quality) for an original Rankin-Bass holiday creation. Rankin-Bass are the 60's/70's/80's makers of fantastic felt frame-by-frame TV programs. Think Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Baby New Year, Year Without a Santa Claus and others. This was a must-have for my holiday DVD and Blu-ray collection!",1522972800,,328,5.58
8621811,5,B00GB0OWSE,"i love the old movies peter cottontail, Santa clause is coming to town,The Easter bunny is coming to town. I am almost 50 and i still love to watch these movies. It brings back so many good memories from my childhood. The kids these days don't  have a clue how awesome these movies make you feel. They just don't make them like they use too and its sad.  If you haven't seen these old movies please watch them. I promise you won't be disappointed.",1522195200,,447,4.309523809523809
8621812,5,B00GB0OWSE,"It's a crying shame ABC Family hasn't shown any of Rankin/Bass' Easter Bunny Trio for YEARS; however, Here Comes Peter Cottontail was seen on the CW a couple of years ago, edited of course. Rankin/Bass' first of only 3 Easter specials stars Shaggy Rogers (from most Scooby Doo shows; Casey Kasem) himself playing Peter Cottontail, Danny Kaye as Seymour S. Sassafras, Antoine the French caterpillar/butterfly, AND Colonel Wellington B. Bunny, and Vincent Price as January Q. Irontail (who would later be the narrator of Michael Jackson's Thriller, Vincent Van Ghoul in the 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo, Professor Ratigan in The Great Mouse Detective, and King Harod in The Nativity, from Hanna-Barbera's Greatest Adventure series)! If you've never seen Here Comes Peter Cottontail, then ""Great chattering chick-chicks!"", you're in for a wonderful holiday classic by Rankin/Bass, whose #1 specialty is Christmas specials! Unbelievably, the 2014 DVD version contains the 2006 CGI movie sequel, on the same disc! And believe me, even it's a lot more enjoyable than The Legend of Frosty the Snowman from 2005. If my big sister didn't like Frosty Returns from the 90's, she'd be boiling mad over the 2005 sequel! If you've always wanted to see the original Peter Cottontail and haven't yet, go right ahead and get this new DVD, which shows it completely restored in HD! Whether or not you wanna see the CGI sequel is entirely up to you! ""ZOINKS!"", you're sure to love the original 1971 Easter classic, Here Comes Peter Cottontail!",1427846400,4,1519,5.08

8621814,4,B00GB0OWSE,Another Rankin and Bass so you know what to expect.  The voice talent is always great. Don't dwell on the plot holes or repetition. Kids will enjoy it. Adults will enjoy the nostalgia.,1400198400,,184,4.575757575757576
