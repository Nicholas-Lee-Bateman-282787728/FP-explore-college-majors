Well presented and lots of information. Worth watching several times.",1180656000,21,245,4.72093023255814

8177076,5,B000ND9208,"A must have for any quilter, especially those who love to quilt art work. Will order DVD's from time to time regarding quilting. Like having your own, private instructor at your side.",1371513600,,183,4.75
8177077,4,B000ND9208,"If you have enjoyed looking at old quilts, or if you own examples of them in your family, this DVD is a great way to learn how they were made.  It's about an hour long and contains the ""basics"" in several segments.  It introduces some of the basic vocabulary of quilting, the steps to making a quilt, and is a good guide for making one yourself, should you be so inclined.  It will probably not be a source to which you will return for information; there simply isn't that much information, but it's a very pleasant and informative hour of fun for anyone age 8 and up, and for adults.  The sewing in the film is done entirely on a treadle machine (no electricity), and throughout the segments, there are hints about how to make your own supplies so that you don't need to spend a lot of money on quilting supplies.  There is also a very cute ""pot holder"" project with good advice on how to sew diagonal edges; this project is really a miniature quilt and has many applications for similar projects.  In all, I thought this was a very good DVD, very reasonably priced too.",1316217600,7,1071,4.383838383838384

8177079,5,B000ND9208,"I originally checked this DVD out of my local library but alfter watching it twice, knew I had to own it. I've seen it countless times and it never fails to launch me into a creative burst. This DVD is about art quilts and the creative spark that has ignited the movement.",1274054400,,272,4.25

8177081,5,B000ND9208,"This dvd is not about traditional quilting (hand or machine) it is about fabric artists. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to each artist speak about their work, what inspires them and their process. For those who are interested in following your own path of creativity and need inspiration, this dvd is for you.

It's too bad one of the reviewers rated this dvd low because there was not much machine quilting demonstrated. I had read a summary of what this dvd was about before buying (from another website) and knew it was about the artists that have stretched the boundaries of traditional quilting. Let it also be said that each of the artists have a great deal of respect for traditional quilting.

This type of quilting is just another way for each person to express their own creativity. I loved this dvd as well as the grand sense of humor each artist seems to have.",1187308800,33,872,4.6558441558441555
8177082,2,B000ND9208,"If you want to watch a Chicago club of middle aged women giggling and dancing and another sewing buttons and candy wrappers on cloth, well this is the DVD for you.  The view of Gallery Quilts flies by so fast it's little more than a blur.  In its favor, there is actual sewing being done by A MAN on a quilt that is quite a work of art.  But this is momentary.  Unfortunately this quilt is demoted to a status of 'also ran' in favor of the junk drawer lady and the giggling chorus.  If you want to see a DVD about quilting and the beautiful quilts that hang in museums keep on shopping.",1186790400,29,586,4.105263157894737
