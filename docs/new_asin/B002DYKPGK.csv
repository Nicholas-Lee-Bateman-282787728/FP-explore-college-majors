3914069,3,B002DYKPGK,"I'd say to give this item a shot. It's cheap, and it's almost five hours of entertainment. Scream and Scream 2 were great, then came Scream 3, which was a kinda rehash of Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Go figure. All in all, it's a faily decent horror franchise, and you get it all in one colletor's set...Until Scream for comes out.",1257379200,,330,4.426229508196721
3914070,5,B002DYKPGK,"I have owned SCREAM since it came out on VHS, then I purchased the other two when they came out on VHS. I am slowly changing all of my VHS to DVD and I have been checking AMAZON.COM for the best DVD deal. This 3 pack was a steal, I only paid $12 total with S&H and unlike many movie box deals each movie has it's own case and they come in the SCREAM box set. I think this is a great deal to get all 3 movies and for them each to have their own DVD box. The quality is great I love these movies and have for a long time. Great steal AMAZON.COM!!",1255564800,8,544,3.739130434782609

3914073,5,B002DYKPGK,"What a great deal - all three Scream films for one low price!  The original Scream basically resuscitated the dead slasher genre in the 90's, with its stand-out cast, plot twists, and the fact that it never took itself too seriously.  Scream 2, did an excellent job of keeping the series alive without looking like a pathetic cash-in on the success of the original.  It was well thought out and wasn't rushed.  The third installment almost went a little too far for me (but hey, its spoofing slasher films and usually by the time you hit the second sequel a series has gone way too far anyway).  All three films are clever, scary, and even funny.  You definitely do not want to miss out on this set!",1249084800,17,699,4.464566929133858
3914074,5,B002DYKPGK,My son was so surprised to get this collection! He loves theses movies (I just can't figure out why [LOL]) But he and hius friends think they are awesome! And the seller delivered as promised in new condition and ahead of schedule!,1370649600,,231,4.523809523809524

3914082,5,B002DYKPGK,"Scream 2 was one of the first horror movies that I watched when I was younger. I remember it specifically scaring the shit out of me, yet I wanted to see the other movies in the series. So I eventually viewed them, and loved them just as much! Such a great series! I got the triple pack for about $13 if I remember correctly. Such a great deal for three great slasher movies! The plots always have you wondering who the masked ""Ghost Face"" is, or who it isn't, for that matter;) Great action, suspense, acting and plot! This is a bargain and golden gem. If you don't have this movie series in your horror collection,make sure to pick it up!!!",1345507200,,642,4.31404958677686

3914107,5,B002DYKPGK,"I'd grown up hearing about Scream and watching previews for Scary Movie and all that, but I'd never actually seen the films. I was so terrified of the horror genre growing up that I just recently began watching them. And this pack is what made me like them!

The quality is good and also, the content of the films is just great. They have suspense, but they're also funny. They really trigger curiosity into other horror films.

It's also great for marathons before you see Scream 4 (which I obviously recommend).",1307664000,,513,4.626373626373627
3914108,1,B002DYKPGK,I have never gotten this movie and they did refund my money but as for buying again from them i do not think that will happen they are not reliable at all so if i was you i would think twice sorry but thats how i feel,1304985600,,217,3.6382978723404253
3914109,4,B002DYKPGK,"You can say what you want about how ""Scary Movie"" made people lost respect to Scream, but the stories were clever, and didn't depend on the gore to drive us through good suspense.
This Triple Pack for fans of the trilogy like me has the three movies in separated cases, on a slip-case cover (which doesn't look as cool). The only one that doesn't get an anamorphic widescreen or spanish subtitles is Part 1, which is a shame being the best of the three movies. Anyway, good way to collect them all in separated cases for a good price, just before the 4th one comes next April.",1299456000,,576,4.392523364485982
3914110,5,B002DYKPGK,"This was a great buy. It came completely brand new with everything in shrink wrap and in great condition.

I love all of these movies, but I ordered from a place called Supermart.  Two weeks went buy and I finally received the package, it wasn't even close to what I ordered. Contacted them and they said there was a problem and the correct order was sent out and should be here soon.  Two more weeks and I contacted them again stating that they needed to overnight the movies to me, or give me a full refund including my S/H.  They haven't contacted me back, and a month of dealing with these people I have no refund or movies.  I help off on giving them feedback in order to give them the benifit of the doubt but after a month of no results I had to file and claim and leave negative feedback.  So buy the movies, they are all great, just say away from Supermart.",1285804800,3,969,5.062893081761007
3914116,3,B002DYKPGK,"Would have been nice if Amazon had mentioned it was 2.35:1 letterbox,
I guess I should have questioned why it was 14.99 well now I know.
It should be illegal to sell movies like this, and if you don't have
a widescreen tv by now you shouldnt be wasting money on DVDs but saving it
for a real TV, mmkay?",1285459200,5,302,4.05
3914117,4,B002DYKPGK,"I've always rather enjoyed Wes Craven's movies, and the Scream Trilogy is no exception.
The first Scream is just a good-natured stab at the entire horror genre and those who are fans of it. It's something new, fresh, and greatly entertaining. There are enough twists to make you not know what's going on, but not enough to completely convolute the story. All in all, definitely a classic horror satire.

Number Two follows the first one nicely. The characters are dealing with the experience's in their own ways, and the movie expands upon the story well. It doesn't break much new ground, but it does enough to keep you entertained and involved right up to the end. I'd say that, in some ways, this movie surpasses the first even.

The Third and, until recently, Final, film is where the series starts to lose itself. Whereas the first two were clever satires of horror films and the culture based around them, this just seems to be a simple slasher. All of the characters we loved are back, although strangely little has changed for them since there second encounter with death. As a straight horror, it stands well. However, if you watch it expecting the same level of humor and suspense as the first two, you will be somewhat disappointed. While the movie is in no way bad, it does hold this Trilogy back from a 5 star product, for me at least.

Overall, enjoyable films and definitely a product worth getting.",1284768000,,1414,4.670682730923695
3914118,5,B002DYKPGK,"Scream is one of the best horror movies around its an instant classic that delivers frights thrills and chills i first saw this movie when i was 10 years of age and let me tell you it scared me then and it still does now Scream is a wonderfully written film with amazing cast! Nev Campbell plays the role of Sidney Prescott a high school girl dealing with the loss of her mother the previous year! Its an extremely unique film one that that other processors have copied such as I know what you did last summer and Urban Legend although both equally as good and thrilling! Scream is defiantly one for horror fans all around and a MUST SEE MOVIE EVENT for any one! the films also start Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Rose McGowan, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jada Pinket-Smith, Rebecca Gayheart, Portia DeRossie, Jerry O'Connor and loads more of famous celebrities!

3914123,5,B002DYKPGK,"The best slasher of the 90's, good story, good humor and good twists. I wish they would release the unrated version of SCREAM on DVD but who knows I'm not complaining i still enjoyed it, so i recommend this trilogy pack to horror movie fans. My opinion of the upcoming SCREAM 4 movie is that i hope they don't screw up a good movie.",1268438400,,332,4.203125

Thing that bugged me was when I received the package one of the disc case cover was ripped on the side but it wasn't a big deal at all. I'm a Scream fan and I enjoyed the Triple Pack a lot. The quality was also amazing, but the ""Deleted Scenes"" for Scream 3 was pretty poor but I'm sure that is how it was supposed to look seeing as it wasn't a clip to be produced.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream-Triple-Pack-Scream-Scream-2-Scream-3/dp/B002DYKPGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream Triple Pack (Scream | Scream 2 | Scream 3)</a>",1267142400,,701,5.5607476635514015

""Scream 2"" -- I found the pacing a little less frenetic than the original but ""Scream 3"" picked up the pace of the original ""Scream.""  Overall, I enjoy this triple terror treat.",1266624000,,305,4.410714285714286
3914137,5,B002DYKPGK,"It's a well known fact that Scream was single-handedly responsible for a major revival of the horror genre in the 90's, inspiring countless inferior productions and entering pop culture. Nearly 15 years after its release, and with a third sequel scheduled to start production in the next couple of months, I feel inclined to renew my vows as a ultimate Scream fan, even if I feel a bit scared of this new sequel.
Truth is, Scream might just be one of my favorite movies ever. I remember being totally shocked when I first saw it, and I could barely sleep that night. That ghostface mask both haunted and fascinated me. I was barely a teenager, and I was amazed that a movie could get to you like that.
It was a scary movie - simple as that - and it had memorable characters who you cared for. The story was interesting, original, and yet, simple. Straight to the point. Soundtrack was great. Acting was fabulous. I think I really started paying attention to technical aspects of filmmaking as I watched Scream and Scream 2 over and over, and listened to the filmmakers talking about it. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that my love for movies in general exploded with the Scream films.
And to this day, it holds up well. From the classic opening scene with Barrymore to the (then-)surprising end, we hold our breaths.
I'm glad I can still say ""Scream is great"" and not be ashamed to have a horror movie positioned amongst many dramas in my TOP-10 favorite movies list!!

P.S. I AM Looking forward to Scream 4.... hoping for the best! It will be, at the very least, interesting to get to see where Sidney, Dewey and Gale are in their lives, what they have done!!

3914140,5,B002DYKPGK,"FIRST OF ALL, I'M A HORROR/SLASHER FILM FAN.  THIS IS MORE OF A SLASHER, BUT THE THINGS I LOOK FOR IN ANY MOVIE IS A CAST WHERE YOU REALLY LIKE THE CHARACTERS AND I REALLY DON'T LIKE A MOVIE TO DRAG ON JUST TO HAVE EVERYBODY IN THE MOVIE DIE OR, IT BE SO FAR OUT THERE, THAT IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE.  I'VE RENTED SCREAM BEFORE AND THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY BORING.  WELL, I SAW THAT SCREAM TRIPLE PACK WAS ON SALE AND DECIDED TO GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I DIDN'T LIKE SCREAM THE FIRST TIME, BUT I WATCHED ALL 3 BEFORE I BOUGHT THE SET, AND I LOVED EVERY MOVIE.

WHEN YOU LIKE THE CHARACTERS IN A MOVIE, IT'S MUCH EASIER TO MAKE A SEQUEL.  I GOT ATTACHED TO ALL OF THE CHARACTERS AND EACH MOVIE WAS DIFFERENT AND FUN TO WATCH.

ANOTHER THING.  I HATE BAD ENDINGS WHERE EVERYBODY DIES, WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE TREND LATELY.  I DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT PLOTS IN A REVIEW, BUT THESE ALL ENDED WELL.

3914141,5,B002DYKPGK,"1)Excellent plot, great suspence, great acting. Wes Craven once again creates history. This is often debated as being Wes Cravens greatest horror flick. I agree completely. It was so intelligent how this movie turned the morals and conventions of the horror genre around and point out the obvious in a horror movie. It discussed the rules and conventions of a horror movie which fans are familiar with and that's a reason why I think it's so successfull. This is one of my all time favourite horror flicks. Drew Barrymore did an excellent job with her role at the beginning of the film. Neve Campbell was a perfect pick to be the main actress. Great movie which gave us scream 2 and scream 3",1259712000,,691,4.626016260162602

You get nothing more except they are housed in the cardboard box you see pictured. Not, that the set is bad in any way tho. It is what it is. You can get this set really cheap if you don't have a Blu-ray player, so I can recommend it for that. I sold this set, and upgraded to all 4 on Blu-ray disc. The Blu-ray discs are pretty affordable and should be all less than 10 dollars now. In my opinion, it is better to just get these all on Blu-ray at the cheapest prices you can get. The translations to Blu-ray are for more superior and worth the extra bucks. Besides, this set does not have scream 4 anyway. The films are really good, and a must have for your collection. I rate this set at a 3.5 because there are affordable things out there now, that is much better than this",1381795200,,885,4.181286549707602
