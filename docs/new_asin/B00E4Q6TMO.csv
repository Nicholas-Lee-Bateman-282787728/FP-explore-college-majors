5890084,5,B00E4Q6TMO,"Absolutely amazing documentary on the big bad guys of DC Comics. Christopher Lee narrating it just gave the movie an awesome awe-inspiring feel to it. With many actors, directors, as well as DC artists and designers giving their opinions to their favorite and created heels of DC, this movie is amazing. And it makes a big time point...what came first? The Hero or the Villain?",1383091200,,377,4.815384615384615
5890085,5,B00E4Q6TMO,"First off, to the reviewer that stated that you will hate this movie, they were clearly wrong.  No where did it ever state that this was a new 'movie', it has always been listed as a DC documentary.  Ok that is off my shoulders.

Next up this video is fantastic in my opinion, yes it is a lot of talking and over readings but it gives you an insight into the DC Universe that probably is seldom seen.  It is well written and choosing Christopher Lee as the narrator was a brilliant stroke.  It really goes into the depths of evil villains of the universe and even goes into the cross over of how the heroes become villains and vice versa.  This is well worth money if you are a true DC geek like me, it was a wonderful thing that they put together and gladly goes on my shelf beside all my other DC Blu-Rays.",1383004800,40,808,4.147435897435898
5890086,1,B00E4Q6TMO,This is not a movie! It's a bunch of authors and writers talking about many different villains. This belong on the special features of a movie. You will be disappointed!,1382918400,7,169,4.666666666666667
5890087,5,B00E4Q6TMO,"This documentary goes thought the greatest villains of DC. It talks about the villains motives, how they relegate to the hero, and a lot of other stuff. Whether your a fan of DC comics or new this video has everything you could hope for. Very entertaining.

How could you go wrong with this being narrated by Christopher Lee?",1382745600,9,325,4.603448275862069

5890090,4,B00E4Q6TMO,"A wonderful DC Comics documentary exploring their amazing rogues and villains, narrated impeccably by the late great Christopher Lee. This is a general documentary speaking about all things bad guy - who they are, what drives them, why they need a hero, why a hero needs them, and which are the best and most memorable villains to date. The interviewees range from artists, producers, actors and directors. It's a beautifully produced documentary, and in HD the colorful artwork just leaps right off the screen. My only issue is that it's a little jumbled, and the topics go all over the place. Newcomers to DC may be confused by all the names thrown around as well. So don't expect a chronological history or anything like that, just a tribute to all things DC villain - a gallery that is arguably even stronger than their overall hero lineup.",1467417600,,844,4.787671232876712

5890111,5,B00E4Q6TMO,"As a big-time comic book fan, I especially loved the discussion regarding who came first - the super villain in response to the presence of the super hero or the super hero in response to the presence of the super villain.  If one side of the equation was to disappear (incarceration, death, boredom, etc.), what happens to the other side?  What then becomes the reason for their existence?  I've lost count of how many times the Joker could have ACTUALLY killed Batman.  We know he's more than capable - he's one of the few DC villains who regularly kills anyone who gets in his way.  In my opinion, this documentary really shines because it involved people outside of the usual cast of artists and writers who are truly passionate about the genre and the subject.  Don't get me wrong - It's always good to hear from the artists and writers but we pretty much know where they stand based on their writing or artwork e.g. it's their job - they love it!",1430697600,,952,4.505813953488372

5890140,3,B00E4Q6TMO,"Not exactly what I was expecting.  I was hoping for a more in depth examination of the various classes of villains most DC Heroes have. Such as those without any powers, those with supernatural abilities, those with scientifically-derived powers, and the silly ones. DC is overstuffed with this last category. It would be refreshing to have had as many of the original creators possible discuss the inspiration for them or a major transition in the villains personality. As it was, we had a lot of thoughts from the current DC administrators. I would have preferred to have heard from more current creators as well.",1408752000,,615,4.913461538461538

5890144,5,B00E4Q6TMO,This DVD was amazing!  It includes professional geeks as well as psychologist analysis's of what drives the villains.  My favorite part is how there would be no superheroes without villains!  I love this documentary!!!,1403049600,,218,5.352941176470588

5890153,5,B00E4Q6TMO,"Very intense short summary on what makes a hero a hero. Yep, it's the bad guys, the  ones you thought had no motivation. you know, the ones you love to hate. Herein is a accounting of sorts on reasoning they employ. In today's world it is real easy to cross the line between good and evil. There is also the line where one can be so misunderstood that drastic measures are the only solutions for what ails a spirit. Here is a great look at that side of the coin.",1393632000,,462,4.133333333333334

5890155,4,B00E4Q6TMO,I love comic books and I like watching documentaries. So a documentary that focus's on the psychological reasoning of fictional Super-villains is my cup of tea...or in this case Iced Chocolate Mocha with whipped cream and fudge swirl.,1393286400,,234,5.184210526315789

5890157,5,B00E4Q6TMO,This movie is awesome. I learned a lot about my favorite villains from dc comics. it has a good insight about the most fearsome and feared villains. you can't have a good hero without a good villain and vise versa. if you are a big fan of dc and superheroes then this is for you. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1390780800,,335,4.014925373134329
5890158,5,B00E4Q6TMO,"Brilliant and insightful interviewees offer a range of views exploring the nature of supervillainy and why we respond to them as we do. A lot of writers, some artists, some movie people, and a couple of psychologists offer a variety of ideas that really address more than our interest in fiction. It addresses our feelings about evil itself. All the examples come from DC Comics, of course, but their ideas relate to any kind of supervillains and quite a few real world criminals, but especially the supervillains.

Well done!",1390089600,,526,4.910112359550562
5890159,5,B00E4Q6TMO,I just got through watching this earlier this morning before lunch.  One the best documentaries of 2013.  After lunch I went out and bought on Blu-Ray and had to watch it again.,1389916800,,177,4.5

5890161,5,B00E4Q6TMO,"This DVD goes into the minds of the writer and producers of DC comics to answer the WHY questions.  There is plenty of thought and reasoning that goes into creating Super Heroes and the same passion goes into creating Super Villains.  All villains are not hated but the GREATER the Villain the GREATER the Hero has to be to conquer the ever surfacing villain within themselves.  Superman, Batman and Green Lantern are three heroes that battle Super Villains that mirror their own belief systems and mental psyches.
GREAT DVD!  Buy it and do not deprive yourself of knowing, to some extent, WHY some Super Villains exist and how they connect to the heroes.

5890163,4,B00E4Q6TMO,This is a good documentary of how we love to hate out super villains and why they are as necessary in society as super heroes.  Don't worry though this is far from all academic.  It has great action in it as well.  Recommended.,1389312000,2,227,4.232558139534884
5890164,4,B00E4Q6TMO,"I'll be honest I thought about giving it a 3 but for some reason I felt it deserved a 4. I like the fact that they actually took the time to create a movie dedicated to super-villains; however I felt like everything was rushed. And they could have dug a little deeper on each character. I knew I was going in to hear about the usual suspects (on the cover) but I really wanted them to showcase their enthusiasm with some of the lesser known villains as well. I wanted more conversation and depth to Black manta and Cheetah. I also wanted other villains to get mentioned like Gentleman ghost or Ocean master, Despero and Catman just to name a few....hell they didn't even mention Gorilla Grodd. Villains aside I thought the narration was perfect and the choice to showcase all the characters at random made it feel as though there was no villain truly greater than another. All in all it's a great documentary to not only witness these iconic characters explained in a different light but also the film gives you first hand the type of effect these characters of the DC universe really have on people and fans as a whole. When you watch it be sure to look at the reactions of the creators and writers of the universe. Their excitement and enthusiasm alone is enough to show you. For a documentary they really get into it. Honestly I'd do the same.",1388880000,,1346,4.475609756097561

5890169,4,B00E4Q6TMO,"I kind of wish there was more information on lesser known villains, so I was a little disappointed. But no where was it promised to include lesser characters, so I can't fault them for not delivering what they never promised to deliver in the first place.

It was very interesting to hear some of the artists, writers, and creators of the characters talk about their process, but you do have to get past the fact that it's an hour and a half commercial for the New 52.

5890172,5,B00E4Q6TMO,"Whether you're a comics reader, cosplayer, or comic creator yourself, you are going to enjoy Mr. Christopher Lee's voice over explaining how the villains function in comics lore. Without the villain, there is no spark to action for the hero and no story so is not the villain actually a protagonist? This question and so many more are reviewed in NECESSARY EVIL which is a terrific doc to educate on the state of the comics medium today. This, just like the PBS special SUPERHEROES hosted by Liev Schreiber, should be in the collection of every comics fan.

5890174,5,B00E4Q6TMO,"This was a fantastic documentary and presented the villains in a way I didn't think of before. I really loved that they used Christopher Lee as a narrator and had so many of the people who have written or been involved in the making of various types of comic book related media.
If you are a comic book fan this is a must see! AND please note it is a DOCUMENTARY not a movie, since some people who reviewed it obviously couldn't read and comprehend that fact and gave it one star because of their own misunderstanding.
I definitely am glad that I got this dvd.",1386201600,,560,4.2924528301886795
5890175,4,B00E4Q6TMO,"Truly a fascinating documentary. I would have given it five stars, but it dragged in some places. I'm glad that DC was the first one to kick this type of documentary off, but I hope Marvel follows suit. The bad guys really don't get enough credit for how important and interesting they really are.

This documentary highlights the critical role played by the villain and covers some of the best villains of our day. I actually wish this type of documentary had been done on just comic villains in general, but DC is probably as rich as anyone when it comes to first-class villainy",1385942400,,580,4.576923076923077
5890176,5,B00E4Q6TMO,"This documentary explains the depths of super villains in the DC Universe and that no one is truly evil. Everyone has a good agenda, but you have to see it their way!!!",1385769600,,168,4.28125
5890177,1,B00E4Q6TMO,I should have payed more attention to what it was really about. Not a Movie But a Conversation basically. Interesting info but not what I thought I was getting. My Fault!,1385424000,2,170,4.516129032258065
5890178,3,B00E4Q6TMO,"This is a pretty good documentary about villains and how they define and/or compliment their respective heroes. I felt it seriously needed a little more focus in some areas and since there's no special features, it feels like it's missing maybe some form of villain encyclopedia of the relatively few mentioned villains (mostly the mentioned one's are the primary nemeses of DC's top heroes) and the people we see discussing the villains.
Overall I almost wanted to four star this, but I couldn't because of one celebrity. Literally every single time DC overrated (once he was great but he's as bland as Marvel's Bendis now) superstar Geoff Johns appears to discuss a villain, this huckster does not technically offer insight into the psyche of the villain, or the villain's motivations, but he simply discusses that said villain is intriguing because ""there's a moment where [villain] did [action] and it's a great moment"". The moments of greatness from the villain is inevitably not something fantastic but a moment or origin Geoff himself actually wrote in so it's a bit of fanfiction self service in my opinion. The villains he discusses are Black Manta, Sinestro, the Aquaman race he created for New 52, Amanda Waller (who is definitely nit really a villain to my knowledge), Flash's Rogues, and several others. Taking into account Zoom (Reverse Flash II), Darkseid, and one or two other brief notes from other creators, this documentary should have been called ""Necessary Evils of Geoff"".
That said it's not truly awful and the end talks about the lukewarm New 52 (painted as loved of course) and the then planned currently in the process ""Forever Evil"" event (I kind of laughed at the part about Rogues writing their weapon abilities on their DNA, because Forever Evil undid that part when the film released).",1385164800,15,1816,4.996699669966997

5890180,4,B00E4Q6TMO,Killer documentary about a topic that I wouldn't think they would have made an actual movie length film.  It's nice to see this roll out in between the other recent animated films because it gives us a break in between for something new .,1384300800,,238,4.409090909090909
5890181,4,B00E4Q6TMO,Its a good documentary but I was hoping for more history on the villains.  It mainly just talks about what makes a good villain which gets a bit repetitive.  I would have liked to have heard how some of the artist and writers came up with their villains.,1383868800,2,254,4.270833333333333
5890182,3,B00E4Q6TMO,"This is something you should watch on Toon Television for free.  Just a bunch of talking heads, with some cartoon clips and moving cameras on comic book pages.  It's just OK.  Got a copy free in Arkham Origins, and had this on pre-order.  Something to watch once and shelve.  Was interesting to see how some of my favorite comic book artists have aged... ;)",1383696000,2,357,4.515625
5890183,2,B00E4Q6TMO,"Evil is part of the human experience, and its examination something every human does at one time or another. DC Comics marketed this video as an in-depth study of evil through the prism of its thousands of 'super-villains'. As such, I expected that this would be either:
a) a feature-length commercial for DC comic books, animation and feature films
-or-
b) what it promised...a unique documentary, offering new and fascinating insights

Instead, it is one of the most un-focused, rambling and overall boring films I have viewed in many years.
Aimed solely at rabid fanboys, who have memorized every bit of minutia from the DC canon, this is a bunch of 'talking heads', including current DC editors/writers, directors of DC comic movies, people from DC animation, and an occasional 'legit' expert (e.g., Neil Gaiman). There is nothing going on, except a lot of dis-jointed comments about arcs, characters and important 'moments' in DC history...all without any context from which to consider their value or connections.

For example, a lot of 'Green Lantern' was touched on during the course of the film. They touched on the 10-year arc of GL Hal Jordan, and 'mentioned' aspects of his arc, like the destruction of Coast City, Sinestro releasing Parallax from the  Central Battery so it could possess Jordan, 'Black Hand's' suicide, so he could begin the 'Blackest Night' arc, the revelation that the Guardians were evil, and the final (for now) denouement between Jordan and Sinestro, after Sinestro had killed all the Guardians. All of these 'moments' were touched on many minutes apart in the film, out of order, without any unifying context for those unfamiliar with the intricacies of GL mythology. In addition, they were showing 'Parallax' from the wretched GL live-action film of a few years ago, which has nothing to do with the Parallax/Hal Jordan arc of the comics (which is what they were touching on).

In short, it was like having a bunch of people walking around a comic book convention, filming random conversations and then clipping/pasting snippets of these conversations together...without any thought of context or continuity...and, releasing it as a movie. You'll learn a lot more about comics...and get a heluva lot more entertainment from a single episode of 'Big Bang Theory', than you will from the mind-numbing chatter of 'Necessary Evil'.",1383436800,8,2364,5.132467532467532

Judging by the title it does needs a sequel because you could talk about so much more and if there do there should do another set of more of the DC baddies there are so much more that also set the impact on the world of evil and there heroes and life of people there effect.",1383264000,,752,7.556818181818182
5890185,3,B00E4Q6TMO,"This is a bit of a niche documentary, seeing as you have to at least be somewhat familiar with the DC universe to fully enjoy it. It sort of skims the surface of the history of DC's villains and how they've evolved over time to continuously challenge their heroic counterparts. I only wish that they had tightened their scope and focused on a smaller set of well known villains to fully explore their histories. I'm familiar with many of the characters in DC's rogues gallery, so I still had a good time watching it, but I guess it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.",1383177600,15,568,4.471153846153846
5890186,5,B00E4Q6TMO,"First off, I must confess to being a DC Comics fanboy. I buy every DVD/Blu-ray they put out featuring Batman or The Justice League and many of the other movies too. This is a very good documentary that covers ALOT of villains, some I had never even heard of. I enjoyed it very much. However if you are looking for an exciting movie, this ain't it. For the casual viewer of animated fare this probably would have been a much better 'special feature' on the next animated Blu-ray release and I have to say even I wondered how long it was going to go on when there was still at least 30 minutes left to go. I really only have one complaint about the documentary: Are we really interviewing WWE Wrestling 'Superstars' as celebrity experts now? That just makes me very sad.",1383177600,4,768,4.415492957746479
