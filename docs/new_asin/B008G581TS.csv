Brazilian workers found a rock with huge numbers of carats in it.  But there's a lot of broken promises, scamming, lies, and outright drama about who's the owner, of about 8 contenders.  Some people may like this because of the legal finagling.

Visually, this work is a challenge.  To me, an American, I felt like I was looking at many diamonds in the rough.  WHy didn't they shave away the ugly brown-looking sand so they could just leave the shiny, perfectly green stones?  The work goes into why South Americans would know a rough rock is worth more than the shiny ""pure"" gems to which we Americans are accustomed.

There are several articles that say winning the lottery doesn't really bring happiness.  This may make you glad you did't have a claim to the stone.  This program suggested no court could ever have a final say on the matter.  It's also suggested the rock is often left in a hobo's house or a stripper's closet or a celebrity's hamper and could be easily stolen from all claimants anyway.",1347753600,,1146,4.646766169154229
