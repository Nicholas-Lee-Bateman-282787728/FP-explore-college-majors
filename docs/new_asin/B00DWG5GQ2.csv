5861691,1,B00DWG5GQ2,This movie is a waste of time. It has poor acting and the plot is super weak. There is very little positive to say about this piece.,1400716800,,132,3.925925925925926
5861692,4,B00DWG5GQ2,"This is a relatively implausible movie in that the protagonist is a woman hypnotherapist who has some undefined relationship with law enforcement. She suspects that some of her patients are being victimized by a male psychiatrist. So she goes undercover in a laughably transparent disguise to try to become a patient of his. Besides the psychological argle bargle, the characters are also able to confront each other within a patient's dreams.
  If you've watched a lot of B movies, all that is OK, but otherwise it needs some serious 'splaining.
  If you've got some time on your hands, and you have no problem with suspension of disbelief, it's a fun movie.",1397779200,5,659,4.90990990990991

5861694,4,B00DWG5GQ2,"strange wry humor, good acting by principals, creepy stellar turn by John Trent particularly!
Could have used a sound track, could still use a sound track if $$$ available.
Excellent first cut on indy film - visuals excellent.
Inconsistencies and script holes aside thoroughly  enjoyed it!",1389830400,4,289,5.282608695652174
5861695,4,B00DWG5GQ2,"I have to start by saying that the review system for movies on Amazon sucks. Yes, it seems there are people who like a particular actor or filmmaker and rate higher stars based on that. And then there are people who live in their parents basement,  completely hating on everything in life, so their review reflects their inner negativity and their self loathing . They give a one star review because they're jealous that their  dungeons and dragons screenplay never got developed and feel that their movie idea was much better than ANYTHING they've ever seen for a movie before.

Thanks for letting me get that out of my system.  So for the people that bash a 200 million dollar movie and say it sucks because it looks low budget and then bash a low budget regional film and say that sucks because it doesn't look like a $200 million dollar movie, they are rating a movie on how they personally feel, good or bad, and i think those reviews need to be ignored. you have to review the movie in context to how it was made.

 I was referred to this movie through a face book request of a friend who was an extra in the movie. I knew it was a low budget movie made New England before I watched it.  I wasn't expecting a STAR WARS or  Speilberg style of film making. I was expecting effort and uniqueness and a different story than what I typically see in a Hollywood films.  I  thought it was shot really well.  The park scene by the water looked amazing and is not typical of low budget movies.  The acting was very good and believable.  Again take it  in context that it is supposed to be  creepy, suspenseful and uniquely weird. It got that across well. I know it takes a lot of effort to get a movie  shot and  through the editing process and then get it distributed, so again kudos for that accomplishment.  so in a nutshell, I liked it and thought i got my moneys worth. If someone complains they lost $2.00 watching an independent low budget movie, then you should seriously consider that they hate life and want to take everyone else down with them.",1389484800,11,2052,4.383597883597884
5861696,1,B00DWG5GQ2,"This was a really boring movie. I suspect the other reviews were written by the family of the director or the actors. First of all, it's a really slow moving movie with zero suspense. There is no excitement, thrills, nothing. The lead actress sounded like she just got the script that same day and read her lines from cards. The bad guy was supposed to be a shrink, but he is a joke. He sounded like an uneducated guy reading lines from a card while trying to sound educated. Forget about him being a bad guy, more of a lame actor
who was a painful bore. There is no sexual predator, only a bad actor putting his hands on a girls leg, a couple girls on their arms
and face. Wow, how exciting. I have seen thousands of movies and this was one that I regretted renting after the first 15 minutes. It only got worse from there. BAD-Boring- Waste of Time and Money.",1388448000,3,861,4.2560975609756095
5861697,4,B00DWG5GQ2,Nice job. Very well shot and professionally acted.  Impressive performances by John Trent and Nicole LaSala. Jami Tenille played a strong lead. Director Kevin DiBacco is someone to keep an eye on. Great cinematography with great lighting. Occasionally the audio suffers some unevenness which is a casualty of many indie pics. But the story is engaging and those glitches are easily forgiven.  Support the arts! Well worth seeing. For three bucks you can't get a slice of pizza and a coke these days.,1388448000,9,499,5.0
5861698,5,B00DWG5GQ2,This is a great film for movie lovers. The cast is  very talented and the cinematography is high quality and unique.,1374883200,3,116,4.523809523809524
5861699,4,B00DWG5GQ2,"Nice script, lovely casting, interesting take on the world of a dark mind. It's also nice to see a strong female heroine in a film; it's not that common these days.

Worth a watch if you're a thriller junkie.",1374278400,4,208,4.333333333333333

8598721,3,B00DWG5GQ2,"It's filmed well, with neat post-production effects for the hypnotherapy/psychic visions, and makes the most of its limitations. It also rises above most indie films I've seen by not trying to be ""artsy"" and eschewing plot for naval gazing introspection or regurgitated philosophy 101. I was never bored, and that's more than I can say for most multi-million dollar Hollywood productions, so if you keep reading this review I suggest bearing that strongly in mind.

The acting is sub-par. How the villain could coerce women into group therapy sessions by openly leering and smirking at them is beyond me. There was zero chemistry between the heroine and the detective/love interest. The highlight, acting-wise, was the therapists' assistant (daughter?) who did a very amusing brat routine. Erica Derrickson, the heroine, seems like a good actress but her characters' motivations seemed muddled, or she was directed poorly.

The script was also a bit of a problem for me. I think the author wanted her heroine to be too perfect. I was confused by her being both a hypnotherapist and a private investigator. The cop ends up just being a guy who randomly throws files on her desk so she can do his job for him, and even the importance of the files is unclear. When he calls her he sounds like a creepy stalker. The worst moment was when he first awkwardly calls her ""foxy"" (this was the only way I knew he was supposed to be hitting on her) and then starts telling her about a bunch of sex crimes. Hmmm, save it for a better context, buddy.",1402963200,,1537,4.752808988764045
