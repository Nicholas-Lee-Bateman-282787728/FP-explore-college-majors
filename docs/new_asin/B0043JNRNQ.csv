8415017,5,B0043JNRNQ,"I think, oftentimes, online reviews of a particular release of a film by several different distributors are simply placed under ALL the releases, so that you don't know if a review refers to THAT particular release, or not. In the case of the Godzillaflix version of SUGARFOOT, I can say that the video quality is quite acceptable (I have seen other versions that are horrible, and they may be what another online reviewer is referring to). In fact, the version I received from Godzillaflix (I ordered directly from them)was not expensive, came quickly and safely, and is on all counts satisfactory. Good luck to those who order!

SUGARFOOT is one of the best Warner Scott films of the 1950s, particularly good in the humor department--who cannot appreciate the antics of Arthur Hunnicutt?  It is a shame that Warner hasn't yet released this Scott vehicle commercially, at the very least in their Archive series. It is a winning issue. Now that they've offered up most of their 1950s Scotts, they need to go ahead and put this one out in pristine quality, as well!",1313625600,5,1064,4.808743169398907
8415018,3,B0043JNRNQ,"This is a good Randolph Scott western that is totally ruined by the quality of the transfer. Don't go by the image quality on the product page - it is a gazillion times better than the movie. The quality of this copy is so awful, I can guarantee there is no one on earth who would be satisfied to any degree whatsoever. Too bad, because now we may never get a decent quality print of this movie.",1304467200,15,395,4.142857142857143

Sugarfoot the film is not to be confused with the TV Western series of the same name that ran from 1957-1961, tho a big connection does come with Arthur Hunnicutt who stars in both. Also featuring Adele Jergens, Raymond Massey, S.Z. Sakall, & Hank Worden, it seems to be a little known Oater in the considerable career of genre legend Scott. It's directed by Edwin L. Marin who collaborated with Scott on 7 other movies, cinematography is by Wilfred M. Cline {Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park, California} and the score is provided by Max Steiner.

Adapted by Russell S. Hughes from a novel by Clarence Budington Kelland, Sugarfoot runs at just 80 minutes and is the kind of no nonsense Western that was rife in the 1950s. It plays out a simple story with the minimum of fuss, throws in some solid punch and gun play, and lets Randy Scott carry the movie on his elegantly chiselled shoulders. There's some disappointment with Massey's villain turn not having enough to do and certainly the romance with the perky Jergens is a touch too formulaic. But with Scott perfect as the gentleman having to get a bit dark of mind, and Hunnicutt on splendid side-kick form, the negatives are but mere specks on an otherwise decent Western mound. 6.5/10",1299542400,5,1478,4.659003831417625
