8364326,2,B002CO83SI,"Movie LOOKED like it had gotten off to an interesting start but with no subtitles and muffled sound recording (which ruined even the occasional English dialogue), it was difficult to tell. (Unfortunately, I ordered the movie from Amazon before the revealing 5 August 2009 review was submitted). Although I can muddle my way through non-subtitled French and Spanish films, I would have skipped this one from the Philippines.

(Note that I have very much enjoyed other movies from the same distributor but they all had subtitles).

I just wasn't able to finish the movie. Too much was lacking for me to make sense of it.",1250121600,3,618,4.876190476190477

 this movie is disappointing. the are no *english captioning* and the storyline
wanders to much.  i hope the movies will start having some good endings where the person ends up being happy and not  in a tragic circumatance as have the last two movies have.",1249430400,,330,4.754385964912281
