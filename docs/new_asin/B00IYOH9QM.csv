8646490,5,B00IYOH9QM,"This DVD set is totally fun. (I do skip the segment on game birds because not my thing.) Kevin Dundon is interesting, enthusiastic and I loved learning from him. Watching him go through techniques and heritage foods is enlightening and entertaining. The cookbook is good too.  So I have to share an unexpected benefit. When I have insomnia, watching Mr. Dundon is great. I relax and enjoy the episodes. I forget my troubles and concerns. It doesn't put me to sleep so don't think that. Instead it puts me in a good mood and makes me want to cook new dishes.",1463702400,,557,4.514851485148514
8646491,4,B00IYOH9QM,Some new recipes presented in an interesting way. I also thought the Christmas episode was included. I should have read the other reviews before buying but I enjoyed the series anyway.,1436400000,,184,4.967741935483871
8646492,5,B00IYOH9QM,My favorite TV chef.  Kevin Dundon seems to so genuinely pleasant and nice and he teaches in a way that makes cooking seem so easy that one can't help but want to.  I loved watching his show on PBS and wanted to have my own copy to watch anytime I want.,1433116800,,253,3.9411764705882355
8646493,3,B00IYOH9QM,The only reason I gave this DVD 3 stars is because it does not contain the holiday episode from the PBS series -- which was my favorite show in the series and the reason I made this purchase.  Would like to know how to obtain the missing episode.,1418601600,5,246,4.125
