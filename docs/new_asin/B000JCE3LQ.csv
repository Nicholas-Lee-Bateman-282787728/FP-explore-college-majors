2669857,5,B000JCE3LQ,I believe this was supposed to be an hour special and it definitely was an awesome hour. It gives a glimpse into the prequel world of Trailer Park Boys and has me itching for more!,1327449600,2,180,4.171428571428572
2669858,5,B000JCE3LQ,"Great special, very funny, but you need to be familiar with the show to appreciate it because it's a prequel.  If you are, then you will thoroughly enjoy this episode.",1322265600,3,167,4.566666666666666
2669859,5,B000JCE3LQ,"There seems to be some TPB fans out there that think the Christmas special isn't up to snuff with the rest of the show, but they are wrong. I am not going to get into too much detail because I don't want to ruin it for other people, but I will say the trademark TPB humor is here and also the special gives a little history of the characters. What seems to throw off some people is that the special focuses more on values, family, and the true meaning of Christmas. Because the show is a little more serious people seem to laugh less even when something funny is taking place. Overall I love the Christmas special and the fact that the show is more heartfelt version of TPB.",1321574400,,674,4.232558139534884
2669860,5,B000JCE3LQ,"Ricky, Julian and Bubbles. If you watch the series, this will explain a lot of things, the famous new yorker and about how bubbles was abandoned. How Randy and Mr Lahey came to be and many other funny situations.",1320192000,,212,4.461538461538462
2669861,5,B000JCE3LQ,"First off, that sounds like a good plan to make some money Hockey Town Dude. The Boys would be proud, you could make like 10-12 bucks a day from those Ebay Dicks. Not quite enough to keep you in hash, rum and chicken fingers but hey, what's stealin' for? Anyways, one of the charms of this TV show that made it such a popular cult favorite is the low-budget, handheld camera technique. Despite the big budget, hollywood production of the movie it still holds all of that Trailer Park Boys charm.

The Boys get oot of jail (kicked oot early, so Ricky can't play goal in the guards vs. inmates ball hockey tournament) and hatch a plan for The Big Dirty, one last heist that will allow them to retire. They're all set to steal vast quantities of change .. why change? Duh .. it's completely untraceable! As can be expected, things don't go 'exactly' as planned and our boys run into trouble with the law.

Another difference between this movie and the show is in the ending. At the center of every TPB plot is a similarly bizarre money-making scheme that goes awry. Of course, the movie is no different but the ending might be a little happier than hardcore TPB fans are accustomed to.

The movie is not canon with the show, you can see a list of a few differences between the movie and the show on wikipedia.

Filmed in beautiful Nova Scotia the cinematography is absolutely amazing. Sets include a trailer park and a prison, I know .. not so beautiful. But a nice, peaceful blue sky sat over many scenes that perfectly fit our Boys' usually frenetic action (I mean 'perfectly fit' in the way that their nice, serene theme music fits them perfectly). ;)",1262822400,,1651,4.493333333333333
2669862,5,B000JCE3LQ,"This is a must-have for any Trailer Park Boys fan.  Besides being hilarious this special shows exactly how much the ""boys"" care for each other and their friends in their own special ways.  I loved finally seeing more of when the ""boys"" were young, how Lahey really lost his job, how Randy became part of trailer park life and J-Roc and Tyrone before they were J-Roc and Tyrone.

2669899,5,B000JCE3LQ,"Some people find Trailer Park Boys offensive. Many people found the waltz scandalous. Some people still don't like the waltz. This collection of characters from Sunny Vale Trailer Park amuse and astound every time I watch an episode or movie. This Xmas Special stands alone, but fans will love learning more about the characters. They cuss, drink. smoke and smoke weed. They also have entertained troops in Afghanistan, as does the series.  One bonus feature explains it well: for all the dysfunction and anti-social behavior, it is a story about family and friendship. If you are offended don't watch. I'm sorry you are such a prude that you need help controlling your own emotions. For the majority of people this special is priceless.

The boys have a cult following in the apple stores doepwn here. At least in New Orleans. It was entertaining to watch the Christmas special, and follow the escapades of the boys.

2669928,3,B000JCE3LQ,"This dvd contains lots of cuss words so if you have kids not for the kids this is strictly adult entertainment. This dvd was made before the Trailer Park Boys was on TV to see how people would respond to the TV show. If you like the Trailer Park Boys it would probably be a good dvd to buy. I liked the TV show but I'm but not too interested in this dvd after I bought it and seen it. But some one else who is a big fan of the Trailer Park Boys may like and enjoy watching this dvd and learning about the characters and what the show is pretty much going to be about. This dvd has the characters talking about the show in this dvd. If I had to the chance to buy it again I probably wouldn't but that is my opinion. I would check it out before I spent any money to buy it or you can buy it, look at it and if you didn't like it sell it. Thank you Sandy McClaflin",1357603200,,861,3.7888888888888888

The franchise has SUCCEEDED, (these guys are millionaires ironically), for over 20 years.  They have a lot going on.  The work that Mike Smith does with Bubbles is truly amazing.

Autobiographical note: I have not had many good X-Mas's. In fact, I can only think of one good one, and it was in 2014. For the most part, I am what you might call a holiday refugee. It may be that I don't even have to explain what that means. I have a pair of graduate degrees, including a Ph. D. If you know someone like that, then chances are you know what it means to be a holiday refugee. Well, TPB X-Mas helps. Period. Not only is it intrinsically good as an instance of the mocumentary genre, it is classic TPB in the style, and under the supervision of, Mike Clattenburg -- that is, in the Golden Pre-Netflix Age of TPB. I say it's intrinsically good, but don't be deceived into thinking that someone who has seen the first few seasons isn't better poised to enjoy it than someone who hasn't.

You can see Ricky's green s***mobile before it got its first ding (and during) as Julian springs an ungrateful Ricky from jail on Christmas Eve, and ""the boys"" go hunting for impromptu Christmas presents from car trunks at the mall.  For anyone who knows and appreciates TRAILER PARK BOYS, this is a hilarious prequel to the series (and for those who don't, it won't make a lot of sense).
