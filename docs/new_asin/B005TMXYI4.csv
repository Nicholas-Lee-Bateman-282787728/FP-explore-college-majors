8486405,3,B005TMXYI4,"In 1940 French West Africa (in what is now the nation of Mali), the new commander (George Dolenz) of the French Foreign Legion must deal with an insurrection by hostile tribes against French colonial rule. An American adventurer (Victor Mature) plays both sides of the fence by selling guns to the Arab rebels yet spying on the rebels for the Foreign Legion. This rather dreary desert adventure can't even be bothered to be consistent with the authentic desert locations (shot in Utah) interspersed with a clearly studio bound desert with unconvincing painted backdrops. Mature looks tired and can barely summon up much enthusiasm for his love scenes with Yvonne De Carlo (looking great) as the wife of the Legion's commander. The film has an uncomfortable pro-colonialism bent as the film's message seems to be that the Arabs aren't ready for self rule. It's directed by Jacques Tourneur (OUT OF THE PAST) but without much conviction. With Marcia Henderson, Robert Clarke and John Dehner.

The MGM MOD DVD-r is a nicely rendered B&W transfer with a 1.85 aspect ratio.",1358294400,7,1068,5.0
8486406,4,B005TMXYI4,"Timbuktu, 1958 film

This takes place in French North West Africa. In 1940 the Foreign Legion was recalled to France. The Touareg tribesmen rebelled for their independence. Timbuktu is a remote city in the desert. A new French leader arrives to take control. The native leader has worked with France before. They cannot resist without ammunition for their rifles. One man tries to make a deal of guns for cash; can they trust each other? Conway wants a pass to leave for another town to sell guns. A deal is made, and Conway leaves with a companion. His party is attacked, French cavalry ride to his rescue. Sewing machines are important. As they travel they find the remains of French soldiers staked out in the sands. Djebehou is their destination, a safe walled city.

Conway visits at night to further his business deal. He travels to a native camp in the desert. The Emir accepts shipment of the French arms (a Thompson submachine gun). Conway is asked to train their men in their use. A spiritual leader will restore their lands. This leader tells what the French have done. The villages have home rule now. The Emir makes his argument. Conway is asked to provide military information about the French. Colonel Charles Dufour gets a message from Conway about the truth. He has a plan for tonight. The Emir pledges his allegiance to the French. Dufour speaks to Conway. Can Natalie carry a message?

The Colonel returns, the Emir leaves on personal business. Mike talks to Natalie, then he leaves on his mission to rescue Mahomet Adjani from the Emir. Conway goes for help and returns. A French soldier is captured; can he be made to talk? No. The Emir figured out Conway's scheme and plans to get information. But Conway knows a trick too. The Emir isn't helpless, and plans to attack defenseless Timbuktu. Can Charles rescue Conway? Can the two escape from the Emir and rescue Mahomet Adjani and then allow him to speak to the people? Or will the Emir stop them? [You know there has to be a happy ending.] This low budget movie is very good due to its story. There are assumptions in this story that may be obvious now.",1355097600,3,2126,4.648936170212766
8486407,3,B005TMXYI4,"Actually this was a UA release in 1958 and now on a ""Made to Order"" release from MGM. I have dozens from MGM and Warner Archive, and have always been satisfied (except for ""Pickup Alley""). This film is possibly my biggest disapointment, but it's a personal thing. First of all the print is excellent (picture and sound), so that's one hurdle. Sadly the film itself is just not that good. Even Jacques Tourneur would probably admit that. The story  is quite good with Vic being both good and bad, and being nothing but Victor Mature. Yvonne de Carlo looks lovely, and has a very attractive hair style (well, I thought so), and her scenes with Vic do carry a certain charge. George Dolenz is OK as her army husband, and John Dehner, who I always like, is completely miscast as an evil Emir (trouble is in those far off days it was only actors like him and Raymond Burr and Michael Rennie who were cast as ""evil Emirs""). The plot moves along fairly well, but often makes little sense, and there are far too many poor studio inserts at inappropriate moments. Did I enjoy it? Mostly, Yes, but I love silly ""B"" pictures, and I am not necessarily a good judge, but I don't think this is a good film, and not really worth the high price here on Amazon, but, perhaps, if you like Vic/Yvonne and Foreign Legion type films you may like this, but I think perhaps not.",1335744000,15,1355,4.42
