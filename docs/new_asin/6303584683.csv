689701,1,6303584683,"I understand this was a student film, but why is it still available, and why can you buy it almost anywhere, including TARGET!? The only parts that are laugh-inducing are the parts that aren't supposed to be funny: like when Big J (good God, why did the girl let people call her Big J like it was her name?) reveals that her plans for the night involve her hanging out with her Sony. It's supposed to be sad but it's just funny and then you feel bad for laughing at her. Big J can't help being so dorky. She hangs out with her boombox for Christ's sake. That is, until Jim Carry comes along. He becomes her supporter when she goes to comedy clubs to ""perform"", but she's not funny. Jim laughs anyway. Way too cheesy. It's so horrible that my brother and I try to get people to rent it, and we tell them that it's the funniest movie we've ever seen....",988502400,4,851,4.226993865030675
689702,1,6303584683,"This could quite possibly have been the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire existence!  First off...Jim Carrey should do everything in his power to have this movie no longer releaseed or accessable to the public.(animals included) This movie can be rented in the comedy section of a video store...it shouldn't be there.  The only laughs I had were me and other people laughing at me for my selection of a wasted night watching this movie.  Sure you may come back and say it was a student film...but honestly, where the hell could he or she be a student at!!  Who would accept someone with such lack of talent and creativity.  Sure the girl was Fat...nbut that wasn't here main problem.  The acted like an idiot all the time and then ALLOWED people to call her BIG J!!  This is a complex written all over it.  This is BIG J calling was always followed by some cheap Yogi Bear impresion...once again retaining back to the fact that she's fat and her rolemodel was a picnic basket stealing bear.  Jim Carey didn't even entered this movie untill about 20 or so minutes into it.  And just furtherd this movies down-hill spiral we call a waste of film.  I was not impressed and don't recommend this waste o time, film, and brain cells to anyone thing.  Even if no one is watching this movie in your house, Please don't leave it on in an empty living room where some small child or housepet could stumble blindly into the path of idiotic rays being dispersed from the TV screen.  MY CAT DIED, WHILE VIEWING THIS FILM.  please heed my warning.",987897600,10,1539,4.489208633093525
689703,4,6303584683,"Descent movie, but nowhere near the standards of quality Jim Carry material.  Most of our time is spent on speculating the teenage troubles of a young girl.  Rubber Face is nothing but a late 70's ammateur film that  happened to feature Jim Carry midway through the movie.  I appreciate the  film's heart, set with the main charactor's cute but trutheful phylosophy.  There are a couple of short comedy bits that deliver quality laughs, but  all in all, the movie is more sentimental then it is humorous.  I enjoyed  the film's innocent taste, as well as the actors' simplistic yet soothing  portrayal of teenage confusion.  Seeing the movie, you wonder why such a  bad script can deliver even the slightest touch of emotion.  This effect is  due to the film's fresh acting, especially Jim Carry's role in playing an  unimployed comedian who attempts to enlighten the main charactor through  his humour.
I admire the film for its simplistic story-line set under a  light tone.  The picture quality was pretty bad, but what else do you  expect from a student film?  The cinematography is moderate, the sound is  reasonably clear, even the scenes appear professionally synchronized.  Like  a satisfying appetizer, this movie is refreshing as it is delightful.  However, if you have a soft spot for Jim Carry, I suggest viewing his later  features, such as Ace Ventura and The Mask.
Do not be fooled by the  cover, this is no Jim Carry ""knock-out"",  but the pleasant  premises makes up for it.  Buy it for easy, quick enjoyment (as well a  glimpse of the ""softer"" side of Jim Carry).  Enjoy!",961113600,,1588,4.813432835820896
689704,4,6303584683,"This was a very different movie. I thought the meaning behind it was very deep and a good one. In 45 min. It said ""What other people think about you is none of your business"" and ""Don't be affraid to try  something new"" I thought it was good for a low budget indy film. And  it really showed Jim's up and coming potential. He is the greatest!",946080000,,342,4.08955223880597

The hat scene alone is worth the price of the video! A very  touching story too boot! I saw this originally on Canadian TV way back in  the waaaaay back and am thrilled to have it in my collection. Complete your  collection too-besides,at this price ya can't lose!",924825600,2,428,4.132530120481928
689706,1,6303584683,"Not to take away from Jim Carrey's accomplishments as a comedian, but this film does not do him justice at all. I think he was only 17 or 18 when this was made. More like an ABC after school special. Only a couple of mildly  funny scenes. Carrey doesn't even show up in the movie until it's half  over. I feel like I got ripped off big time. Original title was actually  ""Introducing.... Janet"". Obviously the producer is trying to  capitalize on Carrey's success without having to pay royalties.",924220800,6,496,4.53932584269663

7851537,1,6303584683,"I am a huge JC fan, and have even met him while working at a huge Hollywood studio (initials WB), but this DVD was very confusing. It's got him on the front casing (making a face that is not even in the film, and is not even funny, rather evil) with JIM CARREY in big letters on it, yet he is just a supporting actor. It shows how young he is, but the film is so badly written, and even the punchlines he and the star (female ) work on are so unfunny, it is extremely painful to get through. The acting all the way around is horrible by the cast. Okay, I get it, low budget, but the film based around the female star just has nothing redeeming to it. Then at the end, I finally thought we would get a little young stand-up by Jim as a reward, but he tricks his co-star into getting on stage, who is painfully NOT a comedian, and the audience laughs at the cornball humor, which is embarrassing. Don't buy it, just go to YouTube maybe and see if you can watch some of it off there. This is a real clear-cut example of the distributor just throwing it out there with Jim's name on it to collect spare $$$ off his stardom. If you want something with him as a young, up and comer, buy Once Bitten. :o)",1406505600,,1197,4.0548523206751055
7851538,5,6303584683,"Great movie, classic Jim Carrey. Been looking for this movie on and off for years on DVD. Reminded to do a search for it during the holidays. Glad I found this so I could make someones Christmas day amazing.",1356393600,,207,4.333333333333333
7851539,5,6303584683,"i'm not going to lie this has to e one of jim carreys worst movies. i gave this movie a 5 because jim came such a long ways in his comedy since this was made. he did not let one losey flop do him under. i also gave it a 5 because i'm a big jim carrey fan. i love all his movies, even this one. this movie is a must have only if you're a huge jim carrey fan other than that i woul not waste .01 cents on it. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you don't unless you're a huge jim carrey fan.",1314921600,,507,3.5765765765765765
7851540,4,6303584683,"If you are looking for another ""The Mask"", ""Ace Ventura"" or otherwise Jim Carrey-y movie it is true that you will most likely be disappointed, however I think that this movie has been somewhat unfairly judged in other reviews here.  This is not a Jim Carrey-y movie and its not meant to be.  I just finished watching it and I found it very, for lack of a better word, sweet.  The movie is about two young people each searching to find their own voice which I think is something we can all relate to, and the friendship that grows between them is lovely to watch and left me with a corny but genuine warm and fuzzy feeling.  You won't be quoting this film after watching it or dressing as the characters for Halloween, but if you give this movie a chance I do think you will enjoy it.  Thank you :)",1242518400,,797,4.251655629139073
7851541,2,6303584683,"This movie wasn't horrible. I read the reviews before buying it and decided to get it anyway because it's Jim Carrey.

The main character in this movie is a high school girl named Janet who puts on an act in front of the other girls at school to make them laugh...when really she's dieing inside. For a class assignment, she must write a paper on ""Why people ____?"". She chose ""Why people laugh"".  I'm telling you this for a reason.

Jim Carrey doesn't appear until about 15 minutes into this 48 minute movie, but stays in it for the remainder. He plays a man named Tony Moroni, who works and performs at a comedy club. Needless to say, his material sucks. Janet goes to the club to do research for her paper when she meets Tony (I told you what I said had a purpose). From there, Janet helps Tony create better material for his bit. The storyline of the movie is how Tony gets Janet to come out of her shell.

It's not a really bad movie, especially for a low budget, independent Canadian film. You still get to see Jim Carrey do his quirky and funny impressions, so that's a plus. Also, the title 'Rubberface' makes no sense. At no point in the movie does anyone talk about making or having a funny looking face. 'Introducing... Janet' makes more sense because of what the story is about and the ending.

Hope you like it!

7851542,4,6303584683,"Yes, the title and cover are very misleading.  It's not a Jim Carrey laugh-fest, although I love watching him in this role.  If you like ""After School Specials"" then this is right up your alley.  Not really a comedy.  More like a drama with a few funny scenes.",1224892800,,260,4.354166666666667
7851543,1,6303584683,"I made my boyfriend watch this stupid movie with me and about 10 minutes into it, he said this is an After School Special.  I about died.  That was more funny than this movie ever gets.  I like the girl star in it - she is actually a good actress, I wonder what ever happened to her.  Anyhow, don't waste your time!",1199145600,,315,4.032258064516129
7851544,2,6303584683,"Ok so my title may have been misleading... but so is the cover of this video. ""JIM CARREY...IS RUBBERFACE"" in actuallity Jim was just a secondary character. I bought this because I live in Perth Western Australia and this movie was never released here. I got a few cheap laughs but was dissapointed by two things...
1) Jim Carrey was hardly in this and despite the title of the film ""Rubberface"" he actually doesn't pull any of his famous wacky faces in this film.
2) The main Character and Jim tease getting together romantically through every scene they are in and nothing actually happened.
not the worst film ever and a definite watch for die hard fans of Jims work wanting to see where he started out.",1003708800,7,706,4.566929133858268
