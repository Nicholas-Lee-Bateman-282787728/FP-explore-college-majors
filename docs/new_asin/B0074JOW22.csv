5054642,5,B0074JOW22,"I just got this DVD in the mail and I immediately opened it up and watched the whole thing. I am huge Wilco (Jeff Tweedy) fan, so this was the main reason for the purchase. Overall, the documentary of all these musicians making music together was fantastic to watch. It looked like it was so much fun! I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall for most of what happened in the studio! It looked like absolute magic! I bet this film was really fun to make too. The fact that the 7 Worlds Collide record was recorded in New Zealand was also amazing. I have not yet been to the amazing island of New Zealand, but this definitely made me want to go and visit. It was absolutely beautiful! Overall, if you are a fan of any of the artists that are featured in this great documentary, I would recommend ordering the DVD! It is just pure joy to watch all these musicians do what they do best - make music!

I just got the CD (kind of backwards, I know) so I am not sure how all the tracks turned out, or if the CD is any good, but I know I will love the Wilco tracks for sure! Anyways, I definitely will be watching the DVD many more times and I highly recommend for any rock music fan!",1337644800,,1186,4.046808510638298
5054643,4,B0074JOW22,"This is a great DVD about the making of the second 7 Worlds Collide project by Neil Finn, but the big question is the album was recorded in 2009, where has this set been?  I wasn't that crazy about the CD, and still am not, but the DVD is a different story, the mix of Neil Finn, Wilco, Johnny Marr, and two members of Radiohead is fascinating to watch.",1337040000,7,353,4.115942028985507
5054644,1,B0074JOW22,"This digital video is *only* the concert film of the 2001 ""7 Worlds Collide"" concert, which is included on the physical DVD of the documentary ""The Sun Came Out,"" which chronicles the production of the 2009 followup concert and album, which features some of the same musicians, and some new ones.

Don't get me wrong, it's nice to have the old concert movie, but I purchased this to get the newly-released documentary film. I will post a positive review of *that* film once I'm actually able to *watch* it. Amazon, fix this.",1334793600,4,524,4.695652173913044

8510029,5,B0074JOW22,"I bought this because I'm a big Johnny Marr fan and it doesn't disappoint.  As well as getting to hear him and see him play his guitar, you will also get to see him eat a salad, get angry at his salad, chew gum on a beach, and attack Ed O'Brien from behind.  What more could you ask for?",1390867200,,287,3.847457627118644
8510030,5,B0074JOW22,"I have watched this film 3 times now and must say it is tremendous. If you are interested at all in the creative process involved in artistic collaborations, this is a must see from start to finish.",1389916800,,198,4.378378378378378
8510031,3,B0074JOW22,"Nice film about the behindscenes and on stage happenings of the  album and concert.
Really bought it for the song ""a change of heart""
That song, makes the whole album, and DVD.
PLAY IT, SHES A JOURNEYMAN SINGER.
 Very nice.",1387929600,,223,4.55
8510032,5,B0074JOW22,"I love these two films. I like how you get to see musicians as people, and as creative creatures. I watch it every nite before I turn out the lights. I say two films, cause as a bonus you get the doc of 2001. The first project Neil did with his music friends, or people who said yes.",1372723200,,283,3.896551724137931
8510033,5,B0074JOW22,"A joyful display of musical camaraderie, chock full of really great tunes.  The inside look into Neil Finn's comfortable, artist-friendly recording studio(s) was very intriguing as well.  The ""extra"" concert from the earlier incarnation of the Neil & Friends super-group was a very worthy bonus, but since it is quite long and has a lower quality of production, I don't recommend watching the two features back-to-back.",1365465600,,419,5.333333333333333
8510034,1,B0074JOW22,"I rented this vid because I'm a major Eddie Vedder fan. Turns out he appeared in the 2001 version, but I sure didn't see him anywhere in this newer version. That is disappointing, to say the least. Not money well spent. I'm sure the musicians are great, I just didn't find the one for whom I rented the vid.",1364688000,,307,4.220338983050848
8510035,4,B0074JOW22,"I've been a long-time fan of Split Enz, Crowded House, Neil Finn, The Smiths, Wilco, and Radiohead. So I bought both of the 7 Worlds Collide CDs. I probably enjoy the live CD more. Something about Eddie Vedder singing a Split Enz song, and Neil Finn singing a Smiths song . . . I'm not sure what it was, but it was nice. Not to say that I don't enjoy the music on this one, though. I do miss Tim Finn and Eddie Vedder. I wish they were there, too, but maybe the house was too crowded (sorry, I couldn't resist).

Anyways, what I wanted to say about the DVD was: I watched The Sun Came Out on the Documentary Channel. I was already familiar with all the songs, since I've listened to the CD many times. Then to see the process of creation, all in the beautiful setting of a beach town in New Zealand, was fascinating. If you're into the CD, or you're into the process of music creation, I think you'd like it.

The most enjoyable part of it for me was seeing the personality of Johnny Marr. I was an obsessed Smiths fan in the '80s, but I didn't know much about them beyond their music. I revered Marr's guitar playing; he still might be my number one guitarist. But I would never have suspected that anyone in the group had much of a sense of humor. I was so wrong. Marr was cracking me up during the DVD, and it was a lot of fun to watch.",1355356800,,1339,4.106870229007634
8510036,3,B0074JOW22,"No concert footage of the new lineup.  Although the original concert is included, most already have it or they wouldn't be looking at this follow up.",1341446400,2,149,4.730769230769231
8510037,5,B0074JOW22,"One can never go wrong with Neil Finn - anything that he touches is almost pure gold and this DVD proves it again and again. Later Split Enz?  Two versions of Crowded House?  Two albums with brother Tim?  Two solo efforts?  Pajama Club?  All gold.  And who else could pull something off like this, especially with Crowded House essentially known as one-hit wonders in the US with 1986's ""Don't Dream Its Over""?  To me, the Seven Worlds Collide projects are a testament to the genius of Neil Finn - and Jeff Tweedy in this documentary comes out and says it.

An interesting cast of characters, including left-overs from the first 7 Worlds Collide in 2001 (Radiohead's Ed O'Brien and Phil Selway, Lisa Germano, Soul Coughing's Sebastian Steinberg, and Johnny Marr), KT Tunstall, members of Wilco, wife Sharon, sons Liam and Elroy, Bic Runga and others, this documentary shows the songwriting process for a charity album for OXFAM, created in three weeks over Christmas in New Zealand in 2008 in Neil Finn's Roundhead Studios and home.  Most of the documentary is shot in the studios, with songs intertwined with footage of the one-off concert that featured many of those songs written in that three week period of time.  Neil is featured in this for sure, but the majority of the documentary shows others in the group writing songs.

The concert featured in the DVD bonus is the 2001 Seven Worlds Collide - I was confused if it was the 2008 concert or the one from 2001.  Its the 2001 concert, which has already been released a long time ago.  So if you think its the latest, you're out of luck.  And maybe one day the 2008 concert will see the light of day.

If you are a fan of Neil Finn and his music, don't hesitate - buy it.",1341014400,4,1727,4.561688311688312
