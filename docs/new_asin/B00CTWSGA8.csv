Thanks",1376352000,,128,4.375
5740396,3,B00CTWSGA8,"Kinda difficult to review. This set looks very good, dvd is enjoyable to watch from a picture standpoint. The black and white video and the audio had been done with the obvious intent to have a watchable set. There are no extras on the dvd, since this has both Sidney Toler and Roland Winters as Charlie Chan you would have thought that some additional features would have been added to enhance the set. Now the difficult part in reviewing this set.
The Sidney Toler movie is not very good. Terrible script, period. This was Mr. Toler's next to last CC movie with him dying the following year after the release. I have seen the last one he made(The Trap) and it is about the same quality.
Now there are three Roland Winters movies, his 2nd, 3rd and 4th CC movies. I found the first 2 on the set not to be that great. Again Mr. Winters was new to the character and I thought very stiff in the role. The last one, The Golden Eye I thought was much better. Many murders, characters and more location scenes that previous ones. It is a Monogram picture and of course not the original Fox production.
All in all, as a owner now of 32 Charlie Chan movies on DVD, I am glad to have been able to have purchased this set. I only have 8 more to purchase to have all available. Do I recommend this set to a NON Charlie Chan viewer, probably not. For a fan of this movie character, yes must have if no other reason than to complete your collection.",1376352000,8,1436,4.283088235294118
5740397,4,B00CTWSGA8,"I'm delighted these movies have been released in such good quality transfers. But: 1. Why not finish the series by including the last couple of movies? and B. The packaging is ridiculous. Each movie runs about an hour but each movie is on a separate disc, and each disc is in its own standard-width DVD case. Do these people we think we have infinite storage space? This set, the earlier Fox collections, and the 'Chanthology' pretty much take up an entire shelf!",1376265600,3,463,4.658536585365853
5740398,5,B00CTWSGA8,as a Charlie Chan movie lover I just had to add these to my collection. I now have a collection of 33 Charlie movies. now I am waiting for the release of the last two (2) movies to finish my collection.,1376092800,,202,3.951219512195122
5740399,5,B00CTWSGA8,The Chinese Ring has been released on the TCM set . Thus leaving only 2 unreleased on DVD . The last 2 Roland Winters Monogram - Featherd Serphant and Sky Dragon . Why they didn't put them on this release is a mystery .,1372377600,9,219,4.0
5740400,4,B00CTWSGA8,"Other reviews about this forthcoming set are praising the release, at long last, of what they're saying is the last of the Sidney Toler films and all but two of the Roland Winters films. Maybe I missed something, but as far as I can tell, no one has released THE RED DRAGON, a 1945 film starring Sidney Toler. Has this one slipped through the cracks? Maybe in another few years, this and the two remaining Winters films -- THE FEATHERED SERPENT and THE SKY DRAGON -- will make it on one final set. Then all we need to make a perfect world is for the missing Warner Oland films to be discovered in somebody's attic...",1371168000,46,616,4.3652173913043475
5740401,5,B00CTWSGA8,"This eagerly-awaited CHARLIE CHAN: COLLECTION (2013) includes four of the last Monogram titles in the classic mystery-comedy series, never before issued on home video:  SHADOWS OVER CHINATOWN (starring Sidney Toler) and DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS, THE SHANGHAI CHEST and THE GOLDEN EYE (with Roland Winters).

These are beautiful, restored transfers from pristine sources that render the low-budget B-classics brighter and clearer than ever before.

This leaves only three Charlie Chan entries remaining to be issued on DVD.

Rating: 9/10 **** EXCELLENT

-----------------------------------------

To set the record straight for new fans and late-arrivals:

Earl Derr Biggers, author of the classic thriller ""Seven Keys to Baldpate"", created the heroic character Charlie Chan of the Honolulu Police in a series of six best-selling mystery novels beginning with ""The House without a Key"".

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Chan-Five-Complete-Novels-The-House-Without-a-Key-The-Chinese-Parrot-Behind-That-Curtain-The-Black-Camel-Keeper-of-the-Keys/dp/0517347075/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Chan: Five Complete Novels: The House Without a Key; The Chinese Parrot; Behind That Curtain; The Black Camel; Keeper of the Keys</a>

Trade-paperback facsimiles and Kindle editions of these books, including the sixth (""Charlie Chan Carries On""), are now available separately on Amazon.

All but one of the original books (""The Keeper of the Keys"") were filmed -- some more than once -- leading to an enormously popular and memorable movie series featuring the beloved Chinese-American detective character which ran for two decades.

The silent versions of Biggers' THE HOUSE WITHOUT A KEY and THE CHINESE PARROT evidently no longer exist.

Four of the earliest Fox classics starring Warner Oland (CHARLIE CHAN CARRIES ON, CHARLIE CHAN'S CHANCE, CHARLIE CHAN'S GREATEST CASE and CHARLIE CHAN'S COURAGE) are considered to be lost films. Aside from the absence of Oland's initial performance and character development, the pity is that these are among the few accurate film versions of the Biggers novels.

(I'm unaware of any record of these priceless films having been destroyed, so hope remains that they may eventually emerge from the vaults in which they have been misplaced. These things do happen.)

All of the remaining 23 entries in the Fox series starring Oland or Sidney Toler as Chan are currently available on DVD:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Chan-Collection-Vol-1-Charlie-Chan-in-London-Charlie-Chan-in-Paris-Charlie-Chan-in-Egypt-Charlie-Chan-in-Shanghai-Eran-Trece/dp/B000EXDSAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Chan Collection, Vol. 1 (Charlie Chan in London / Charlie Chan in Paris / Charlie Chan in Egypt / Charlie Chan in Shanghai / Eran Trece)</a>

VOL. 1, the first collected round of Fox films starring Warner Oland, finds the ""Charlie Chan"" series liberated from the Biggers novels and coming into its own as an original movie phenomenon.

The outstanding CHARLIE CHAN IN PARIS introduces the great Keye Luke as his iconic character Number One Son, Lee Chan.

Like THE BLACK CAMEL, EGYPT is an interface with the Hollywood Classic Horror Film -- one of several which stand among the most popular entries. With the first-class SHANGHAI the series moves into high-gear.

ERAN TRECE is the alternate version of the missing CHARLIE CHAN CARRIES ON, filmed in Spanish with a different cast. It allows us a glimpse of what the first film in the ""official"" series was like.

All the current Fox ""Chan"" issues have been painstakingly restored, using digital technology, to remove scratches, blemishes and other damage. For their vintage, the films look good as new.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Chan-Collection-Vol-2-Charlie-Chan-at-the-Circus-Charlie-Chan-at-the-Olympics-Charlie-Chan-at-the-Opera-Charlie-Chan-at-the-Race-Track/dp/B000GY728I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Chan Collection, Vol. 2 (Charlie Chan at the Circus / Charlie Chan at the Olympics / Charlie Chan at the Opera / Charlie Chan at the Race Track)</a>

In VOL. 2, the Fox series reaches its peak with OLYMPICS and RACE TRACK among the best of the Oland films.

CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OPERA, co-starring Boris Karloff, is often cited as the zenith of the entire series.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Chan-Collection-Volume-3-Charlie-Chan-s-Secret-Charlie-Chan-at-Monte-Carlo-Charlie-Chan-on-Broadway-The-Black-Camel/dp/B000QGDJG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Chan Collection, Volume  3 (Charlie Chan's Secret / Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo / Charlie Chan on Broadway / The Black Camel)</a>

VOL. 3 of the Fox collections rounds out the Chan films of the great Warner Oland in top form.

THE BLACK CAMEL (1931), the sole survivor of the first five Warner Oland Charlie Chan films, is now the single ""official"" Chan film to be authentically adapted from an Earl Derr Biggers novel. Co-starring Bela Lugosi, fresh from DRACULA (also 1931) at  the peak of his Hollywood career, it is one of the finest and most potent films in the series.

Continuing the ""spooky"" mood is the ghostly SECRET, while ON BROADWAY is a strong entry with a genuinely surprising outcome.

The previously rare ""talkie"" film BEHIND THAT CURTAIN, loosely based on the Biggers novel of the same title, is included as a valuable extra (despite the leading character of Charlie Chan being reduced to a bit part).

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Chan-Collection-Vol-4-Charlie-Chan-in-Honolulu-Charlie-Chan-in-Reno-Charlie-Chan-at-Treasure-Island-City-in-Darkness/dp/B000YDMPCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Chan Collection, Vol. 4 (Charlie Chan in Honolulu / Charlie Chan in Reno / Charlie Chan at Treasure Island / City in Darkness)</a>

Beginning with HONOLULU, character actor Sidney Toler successfully takes over the role of Charlie Chan upon the death of Warner Oland and eventually comes to rival Oland in popularity.

RENO is a solid entry that demonstrates Toler's mastery of the role and the streamlined tone adopted to accomodate his more earthy portrayal.

CHARLIE CHAN AT TREASURE ISLAND is often cited as the very best of Toler's films and a landmark for the entire series.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Chan-Collection-Vol-5-Charlie-Chan-At-The-Wax-Museum-Murder-Over-New-York-Dead-Men-Tell-Charlie-Chan-In-Rio-Charlie-Chan-In-Panama-Murder-Cruise-Castle-in-the-Desert/dp/B001ARDBXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Chan Collection, Vol. 5 (Charlie Chan At The Wax Museum / Murder Over New York / Dead Men Tell / Charlie Chan In Rio / Charlie Chan In Panama / Murder Cruise / Castle in the Desert)</a>

VOL. 5 concludes the prime Toler entries and completes the high-grade Fox Chan series.

Although somewhat dated by its then-topical focus, PANAMA is the stand-out here, sporting an especially good cast.

RIO and MURDER CRUISE are reworkings of BLACK CAMEL and CARRIES ON/ERAN TRECE, respectively.

WAX MUSEUM returns Chan to the realm of the Hollywood Horror film, as does the superior Gothic CASTLE IN THE DESERT, one of Toler's best, which sends off the classic Fox Charlie Chan series with panache.

(Fox's CHARLIE CHAN COLLECTION Vol. 1-5 are also available as a single order on Amazon.)

The long movie saga of Charlie Chan was far from over when Sidney Toler and the continuing series migrated to low-budget Monogram studios, whose seventeen entries have a charm, mood and humor of their own. Eleven of these starred Toler, with Roland Winters stepping into the part for the final six films. Most of the Monogram Chans benefit enormously from the addition of comedian Mantan Moreland to the leading cast.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Charlie-Chan-Chanthology-The-Secret-Service-The-Chinese-Cat-The-Jade-Mask-Meeting-at-Midnight-The-Scarlet-Clue-The-Shanghai-Cobra/dp/B00020X87A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Charlie Chan Chanthology (The Secret Service / The Chinese Cat / The Jade Mask / Meeting at Midnight / The Scarlet Clue / The Shanghai Cobra)</a>

The first group of Monogram Chans, all starring Toler, were initially released to DVD by MGM in as a 6-disc boxed set.

CHINESE CAT shows the new series at its best, while SCARLET CLUE is a particularly lively entry redolent of old-time serials.

BLACK MAGIC/MEETING AT MIDNIGHT and JADE MASK are popular due to their spooky atmosphere.

SHANGHAI COBRA, shot by cult director Phil Karlson, is a notable little film noir that transcends its meager resources.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Chan-5-Movie-Gift-Box-Set-Limited-Series/dp/B00598O9RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Chan 5 Movie Gift Box Set (Limited Series)</a>

Five of the Monogram/Toler films (excluding BLACK MAGIC/MEETING AT MIDNIGHT) were reissued to DVD in 2011 on a 2-disc set at a very reasonable price. Ardent fans will prefer the comparatively deluxe CHANTHOLOGY but this high-quality bargain edition will serve as a good introduction to the Monogram series.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TCM-Spotlight-Charlie-Chan-Collection-Dark-Alibi-Dangerous-Money-The-Trap-The-Chinese-Ring/dp/B00383XZP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TCM Spotlight: Charlie Chan Collection (Dark Alibi / Dangerous Money / The Trap / The Chinese Ring)</a>

After an agonizingly long wait, TCM/Warner's TCM SPOTLIGHT: CHARLIE CHAN COLLECTION fulfilled the wishes of legions of Chan fans with a set of 4 of the 7 remaining Monogram films.

Toler stars in DARK ALIBI, DANGEROUS MONEY and THE TRAP while THE CHINESE RING features the debut of Roland Winters in the role.

DARK ALIBI, Phil Karlson's second and most fully realized Chan film noir (after SHANGHAI COBRA), is in itself a valuable addition to any Chan library.

CHARLIE CHAN: COLLECTION (2013)

The present four-film set features Sidney Toler in SHADOWS OVER CHINATOWN and Roland Winters in DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS, THE SHANGHAI CHEST and THE GOLDEN EYE.

Only 3 official entries now remain unissued on home video: Toler's THE RED DRAGON (1945), Winters' THE FEATHERED SERPENT (1948) and THE SKY DRAGON (1949). Their eventual release will at last complete the full DVD collection of all 40 extant films in the official ""Charlie Chan"" series.

One of the rarest Chan dramatizations, the complete NEW ADVENTURES OF CHARLIE CHAN television series, starring J. Carrol Naish, is currently available on DVD in 5 boxed sets. (There was also a CHARLIE CHAN radio series to be sought out.)

An otherwise mediocre Saturday Morning cartoon show from Hanna-Barbera, THE AMAZING CHAN AND THE CHAN CLAN, was significant for its use of the voice of former Number One Son Keye Luke as Charlie Chan.

The campy comedy CHARLIE CHAN AND THE CURSE OF THE DRAGON QUEEN, starring Peter Ustinov, is available used and new from Amazon Marketplace sellers.

Lastly, for the completist: The made-for-TV movie, CHARLIE CHAN OR HAPPINESS IS A WARM CLUE, starring Ross Martin, has not yet been announced for release.

* THE LOST WARNER OLAND FILMS:
Apparently all prints and negatives of four films were destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1937.
Through some fancy footwork, Warner Video has been able to bring three of them back to life:

--- ""Charlie Chan Carries On"" (1931)
Simultaneously with this lost film, a Spanish-language version was filmed using the same sets and costumes:
""Eran trece"" (""There Were Thirteen"") starring MANUEL ARBO (photo 3) as Charlie Chan.
It's in VOLUME 1 with English subtitles (coupled with ""Charlie Chan in Shanghai"")

--- ""Charlie Chan's Chance"" (1932) and ""Charlie Chan's Courage"" (1934)
Warner Video cleverly reproduced these lost films using voice actors, the original screenplay, still photos and music. Sort of like a one hour radio show with illustrations:
""Charlie Chan's Chance"" is in VOLUME 3 (coupled with ""The Black Camel"")
""Charlie Chan's Courage"" is in VOLUME 4 (coupled with ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu"")
Too bad they didn't do the same with ""Charlie Chan's Greatest Case"" (1933)

CHARLIE CHAN'S ASSISTANTS
Beginning with the eighth film (""Charlie Chan in Paris""), the series introduced various family members to assist their father in crime-solving.
Over the next fifteen years, four sons and two daughters fulfilled this role, all played by Chinese-American actors:
1) Lee = ten films (Keye Luke)
2) Jimmy = thirteen films (Sen Yung - later billed as Victor Sen Yung)
3) Tommy = eleven films (Benson Fong or Sen Yung)
4) Eddie = one film (Edwin Luke)
5) Iris = one film (Marianne Quon )
6) Frances = one film (Frances Chan - her actual name)

Until this collection was offered, I haven't been able to find any Chan movies starring Roland Winters. I especially like seeing no. 2 son, and Birmingham Brown in these episodes. These two characters are sorely missed in some of the Warner Oland, Sidney Toler movies. All-in-all, this collection is very good, with good plots.
Ironically, the one disc in this bunch starring Sidney Toler, in my estimation, was the best as far as atmosphere, and story line as typically seen in most  Charlie Chan movies.",1441584000,,612,4.884615384615385
5740436,2,B00CTWSGA8,"These were four of the five Charlie Chan movie shorts.  Winters is the worst Chan compared to Warner Oland (the top actor) and Sidney Toler (second best).  The gap between Toler and Winters is The Great divide. Like the last Toler's Chans made at Monogram Pictures, these were also made there.  Cheap, cheap cheap everything--sets, stories, etc.  however one positive note, these stories played by Winters were heads above the ones that Toler did prior to his death.  So, this ends up being pretty good stories made by a bad actor as Chan, rather than bad stories portrayed by Oland and the younger Toler, the worst of these different combinations.  If you can ignore Winters' portrayal as Chan and concentrate on the stories, this could be a 2 1/2 star rating.  I purchased these to complete the Chan Anthology, even if two are still not yet on DVD.  An enigma, for sure.",1437523200,,872,4.690789473684211

5740466,3,B00CTWSGA8,"I now have all but the one missing movie in the series and the last few are the least enjoyable of the series. Mostly due to the choice of Roland Winters to fill in the role of Charlie Chan after Sidney Toler' s death. But bad acting on his part isn't the only detriment to these shows. Bad scripting, bad directing and even bad makeup to make Winters look Chinese make too many flaws in an otherwise enjoyable series. If it wasn't for the presence of numbers one and two sons and chauffeur Birmingham Brown there wouldn't be any resemblance to the Charlie Chan mysteries. Winter's feeble attempt to sound Chinese is embarrassing even to Caucasian, let alone Chinese, viewers. (Not withstanding the criticism for not using a Chinese actor to portray Charlie Chan to begin with.)
I was brought up on Charlie Chan and many other great classic movies, so I really enjoy these old black and white films and make sure to watch them at least once a year. When it comes to putting on the last couple of discs I see how changes in ownership to the rights to the stories and a change in production of them greatly deteriorated their quality and am almost glad they didn t make any more because they likely would not have improved.
Oddly enough, if you are a real Charlie Chan fan I recommend you get all of the movies so you have the complete set. But be prepared for some disappointment with the Roland Winters' portrayal of a too-demeaning, too-egotistical, charmless and uninspiring version of the famous Chinese detective that only Tony Randall' s comic portrayal could make worse.",1401926400,,1576,4.632142857142857
5740467,5,B00CTWSGA8,"This is a very good Charlie Chan box set. There's only one movie with Sidney Toler, but the other

5740472,5,B00CTWSGA8,"The Charlie Chan Collection is a long awaited collection of four of the last seven Charlie Chan movies to be released on DVD.  The four include the following:

Shadows Over Chinatown starring Sidney Toler.  While on his way to solve a murder, Charlie meets a woman who is searching for her missing grandaughter.

Docks of New Orleans starring Rolan Winters.  Charlie is called in to investigate the mysterious going-on of the partners of a powerful chemical company.

Shanghai Chest starring Roland Winters.  Charlie attempts to solve a seriew of murders in which a dead man's fingerprints show up at all three murder sites.

The Golden Eye starring Roland Winters.  Charlie and his crew head out to Arizona and dig up a scheme involving a gold mine.

All movies have been restored fabulously - both in picture and sound.  Roland Winters is not the best Charlie Chan as compared to Sidney Toler or Warner Oland but does a respectable job.

The set of four DVDs is packaged in a reasonably strong cardboard case.  A very reasonable price as well.

5740477,3,B00CTWSGA8,"Loosely basing the character the legendary police officer Chang Apana (1887-1933), author Earl Derr Biggers (1884-1933) wrote the first Charlie Chan novel in 1925. His novels, six in all, were immensely popular--and Hollywood soon bought the rights. At least two silent films, which do not survive, were made; a third film, BEYOND THAT CURTAIN, reduced the character of Chan to a minor role. In 1931, however, Fox studios hit the right mixture of mystery and comedy with CHARLIE CHAN CARRIES ON.  The series originally starred Warner Oland; upon his death, the role of Chan passed to Sidney Toler and the films remained as popular as ever.  But in 1941 the series hit a bump in the road: 20th Century Fox felt that an Asian detective would be unpopular in the wake of Pearl Harbor.  Deeming the property worthless, they sold the rights to Chan to actor Sidney Toler--who proved 20th Century Fox wrong by taking the character to Mongram Studios, where the series continued with some success.

At 20th Century Fox, the Chan movies had ""B"" budgets, but they made use of ""A"" actors, writers, directors, and the studio's standing sets.  At Monogram, ""B"" meant ""B,"" and the Chan films quickly lost the sly wit for which they were famous and drifted into mildly enjoyable but not greatly memorable programers.  (The best known entries in the Monogram series are collected in CHANTHOLOGY, which includes DVD releases of THE CHINESE CAT, JADE MASK, MEETING AT MIDNIGHT, SCARLET CLUE, SECRET SERVICE, and SHANGHAI COBRA.  Lesser known titles are collected in TCM SPOTLIGHT CHARLIE CHAN COLLECTION, which includes DANGEROUS MONEY, DARK ALIBI, and THE TRAP, all starring Sidney Toler as Chan, and THE CHINESE RING, starring Roland Winters as Chan.  In addition to Sidney Toler, most of the Monogram series also starred Mantan Moreland, an African-American comic of considerable talent whose career was limited by stereotypes of the era.  The series usually featured largely unknown Asian actors as the various Chan children, but some later films in the series include Victor Sen Yung, who had appeared with Toler in the 20th Century Fox series.

THE CHARLIE CHAN COLLECTION includes four films, each on a separate DVD and each in a separate plastic case.  All four films feature Mantan Moreland and Victor Sen Yung.  SHADOWS OVER CHINATOWN, 1946, is the next-to-last Chan film starring Sidney Toler; although it is more considerably more coherent than the last of Toler's Chan films, THE TRAP, it is an uphill tale of missing persons, a torso murder, and insurance fraud in San Francisco.  The remaing films in this set star Roland Winter, who was selected by Monogram to continue the series as Chan after Sidney Toler's death.  All three were filmed in 1948.  THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS is a loose remake of a 1930s Monogram Mr. Wong film starring Boris Karloff, and involves the notion of murder by poison gas concealed in a glass container. THE SHANGHAI CHEST finds Chan investigating a series of murders that appear to have been committed by an already-executed criminal.  THE GOLDEN EYE seems vaguely based on the Chan novel THE CHINESE PARROT in a story that has Chan undercover as a jade dealer to better investigate mysterious doings in a gold mine.  While the Winters films aren't at the top of the Monogram series, much less the 20th Century Fox series, they are at least watchable, and Chan fans will likely them find them entertaining.

Roland Winters has never as popular as Charlie Chan as Warner Oland and Sidney Toler, but I think he is somewhat underestimated in the role, which he redefines as slightly chilly and more acid.  Although he takes some getting used to, and while he will never compete with Oland and Toler, he gives very capable performances.  But the real applause here goes to Moreland and Yung.  Although the comedy is somewhat racist by today's standards, they give the movies energy and humor and make them enjoyable.  The prints are incredibly, incredibly good, sharp in black and white, and the sound elements are also good.  There are, unfortunately, no extras of any kind.

5740480,2,B00CTWSGA8,"Not all Charley Chan Movies are created equally.
The there were 47 movies made from the late 1920s through 1948.
The initial series of movies were made at Fox studios. Even though they were ""B"" movies, they were a quality product with high production values.

The later movies, the ones featuring Roland Winters, were all produced at Monogram studios.
Monogram was a ""poverty row"" studio. Their Chan movies were produced on substantially lower budgets, and the quality of these later movies drops  considerably.

One of the most appealing aspects of the earlier movies is the quality of the writing.  This is not evident the Chan movies filmed at Monogram. The charming ""witty Chan-isms"" are missing from the Monogram movies.  Monogram's Chan is very bland and missing the unique characteristics of the Fox Chan.

There were five different actors who played Charley Chan.  Roland Winters is by far the least effective Chan. He is hampered by the poorer plots and the lower production values, but he makes some very bad choices in how he interprets the character.
Winters plays Charley Chan as if he is heavily medicated, and possessing sub standard intelligence. There also a certain mean spiritedness and sarcasm in the Winter's Chan.

There were 47 Chan movies. Two of the movies in this collection are by far the worst of all theChan Movies.
""The Docks of New Orleans"" seems to plod on and on and on.  The whole plot centers on a broken radio tube.
To modern audiences this is especially dated and boring.

The only reason to get this collection is if you want to watch all 47 of the Chan movies.
If you want to watch interesting and exciting movies, pass this set by...and get sets featuring the movies filmed by Fox.",1392681600,,1721,4.803389830508475

5740485,4,B00CTWSGA8,"IMHO, these four films are lesser entries in the venerable Charlie Chan series, but worth for having if you are a collector and insist on having the entire series. The audio is crisp & clear for the most part and the video looks surprisingly good for these old films, especially considering that they're from a poverty row studio like Monogram Pictures, and the prints probably didn't receive the best treatment over the years. Let's just hope the last few Roland Winters films are eventually offered.

I may be at odds with many other Chan Fans, but Sidney Toler is my favorite Chan. Victor Sen Yung is most enjoyable as Chan's Number #2 son, Jimmy. His turn is an almost seamless transition from Keye Luke role as Number #1 son, Lee. Chan's chauffeur, Birmingham Brown will be an acquired taste for some and no doubt many viewers new to films from this period may be offended by the often clueless, ""yessuh, nosuh"" scaredy-cat character. A racial stereotype to be certain, one that actor Mantan Moreland honed to razor-sharp perfection over the course of his prolific 40-year film career. He was the go-to man at Monagram studios when a comedy relief-type character was needed, and despite the low-standing which most black actors were forced to endure during this unenlightened period in film history, Moreland received very high billing in the films he was in. And to be honest, the man was a very gifted, funny comedian with great comedic timing. I enjoy the light-hearted hijinks of Birmingham Brown, but others may find the character off-putting, or downright annoying. To each his own.

My biggest complaint about this set is that the packaging is too big for just four films. They could have at least put 2 discs in each case, to save some space. Nowadays, many vendors are using space-saving slimline cases, either 9mm or even 7mm thick. Many current TV series box sets use the ultrathin 5mm slimline double-disc cases. Unfortunately, this Charlie Chan box set uses one 14mm standard size single-disc case for EACH film. A huge waste of space. Everything else is okey-doke here. The audio & video are quite good considering the age of the material and the fact that none of the films received any sort of restoration work. Nice addition to my Chan collection.

5740502,4,B00CTWSGA8,"Shadows Over Chinatown, starring Sidney Toler as Charlie Chan, starts with a lengthy explanation of missing people.  Why?  I haven't the foggiest clue as I'm still trying to figure out what the title means.  Personally, I think they slipped in that lecture as a stalling tactic.  Sidney Toler was ailing at the time this was filmed, hence the many scenes with #2 son (Victor Sen Yung) and Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland).  Charlie was practically a guest star in his own movie.  The plot involves a woman hiding in plain view from people she wants to avoid, as they are out to kill her.  It's not brilliant but it works.

Docks of New Orleans had a decidedly familiar air about it until I finally realized it was a remake of a 1938 film, Mr. Wong, Detective staring Boris Karloff as Mr. Wong.  This time it's Charlie Chan (played with stultifying officiousness by Roland Winters) who solves the case of several murders taking place in closed rooms occupied by a single person soon made dead.  As usual, it's up to Victor Sen Yung and Mantan Moreland to provide all the comedy that helps brighten an average story relating very little intrigue.

Shanghai Chest is one of those movies where a prime suspect looks mighty suspicious at the outset because the blithering idiot picked up the murder weapon and was caught standing over the body.  It doesn't help that he has a grudge with the victim, his uncle, who was about to remove the nitwit from his will.  Could anything else possibly go wrong!  In steps Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland) and Tommy Chan (Victor Sen Yung), more than a little slap-happy and willing to get caught breaking and entering someone's house.  ""Pop will have to admit we're smart.""  Not a chance.  This one also stars Roland Winters as Charlie Chan.  What he lacks in humor, he more than makes up for in stiffness, almost approximating a real person.

The last gem in this set is The Golden Eye, a case involving the old west.  Considering the number of people on horseback, shooting up a storm, it's the wild wild west.  Some poor old geezer is dispatched then impersonated, found in a bed ala the Invisible Man, bandaged to the hilt.  There's gold, a mine with a secret entrance everyone keeps leaving open, a dubious nun, and yes, Birmingham Brown and Tommy Chan are both front and center doing what they normally do, get in the way.

Not great by any means, I bought this set to get as close as I can to the complete series of Charlie Chan movies (3 films are still unaccounted for and they are 1945 The Red Dragon, 1948 The Feathered Serpent, and 1949 Sky Dragon).

There seem to be only 3 remaining films from this Chan series: The Chinese Ring (1945), The Feathered Serpent (1948), and The Sky Dragon (1949), so I hope the last volume of this collection will NOT take another tow years to complete. It's too bad that WARNER BROS could not have offered a larger 7-Disc collection (in a slim flip pack casing) to round out this series. I was entirely pleased, HOWEVER (like almost all of the Chan collections ... with the exception of the previous set) ... WHY WHY WHY do they not use slim-line, small book-bound or flip-pack casings/packaging as do most other DVDs! Absolutely nothing is more annoying than trying to shelve (if you are a collector) all of these oversized 'concrete blocks' and maintain spacing for your collections. I just can't fathom as to 'why not'??!! It saves, space, plastic and would make any collection more enjoyable and easier to store and enjoy. As per this item (judging from the last collection packaging and current 'misleading' photo) ... I had expected a slim-case version for this set. NOT!! Back to the old ways and habits. Overall, a GREAT collection of high-quality films ... BUT the packaging is inexcusable! So, as CONFUCIUS said, ""He who will not economize will have to agonize.""",1376611200,2,1465,4.794466403162056
5740519,5,B00CTWSGA8,"The ""Charlie Chan Collection"" 4-DVD box set release from Warner Brothers is the follow-up to their 2010 compilation of four other Chan adventures.  Since the previous release, WB has worked hard to bring the films in the current collection up to release quality, and their labors have certainly paid off.  Fans of the honorable detective will be amazed at the vivid clarity of all for films contained in this very worthy offering.  This brings a sense of newness to these movies certainly not present since their original releases decades ago.

""Shadows Over Chinatown"" stars Sidney Toler who had first taken on the role of Charlie Chan at 20th Century-Fox.  When the Chan series ended at Fox, Toler brought the detective to Monogram Pictures, a ""poverty row"" film production company, where he went on to make 11 Chan movies until his passing in 1947.  The role of Charlie Chan was then assumed by Roland Winters whose efforts are seen in three films from this set, ""The Shanghai Chest,"" ""Docks of New Orleans,"" and ""The Golden Eye,"" as he brought with him his own take on the character.  In all four pictures in the collection, viewers are treated to the carryings-on and interplay between Victor Sen Yung and Mantan Moreland who add their own comedic spice to the mix.

I give the ""Charlie Chan Collection"" my highest recommendation.  For those who may have seen these movies on late night television or perhaps on the big screen in their youth, or for those who have yet to experience for themselves some of the magic that resulted in iconic detective Charlie Chan's lasting grip on our culture, the Charlie Chan Collection"" is a must have!",1376611200,29,1643,4.818505338078292

I am very happy to have these DVDs with good quality picture and sound so I do not have to watch the PD copies I have.  What I can't understand is why Warner's did not include the other 3 available CC movies that have not been restored in this set thus leaving only the ""lost films"" to be searched for.  I agree that the packaging is ridiculous, they could have used slim line cases as TCM did in their set.  This BIG box and cases for 4 films that are each about 65 minutes long and could have been put on 2 DVDs in a slim case is wasteful and takes up too much space.  I don't mind that there are no extras as there was a lot in the FOX sets.  The liner notes on the box are a laugh, calling CC an ""amateur"" detective, showing whomever wrote them had no idea what they were writing about.  I took off 1 star for the dumb packaging.

5740523,2,B00CTWSGA8,"I have to echo the comments of a previous reviewer concerning the packaging - this set is WAY too big!

One film per disc (not even slimline cases either) - seriously?! This set is the exact same size as the Twentieth Century Fox Volume 5 release(or double the size of the TCM Spolight collection of Chan films, also containing 4 movies) - that particular set contained 7 movies - that's the exact same number this collection should have had. Instead, Warner are milking the cash cow by splitting the final 7 Chans into this set of 4 and (hopefully) a release of the final 3 titles left unreleased. And, yes, after this set, there are three titles left to be released, not two! These being: Sidney Toler's 'The Red Dragon' (1945) and two Roland Winters' movies, 'The Feathered Serpent' (1948) and 'The Sky Dragon' (1949).

Don't get me wrong, its great to have these movies released, its just that I'm less than impressed with how they've been marketed - who designed the cover artwork and DVD menus?!

Cover artwork aside, there's a decent level of remastering here - so that's a plus point - in fact, the remastering in my mind is pretty outstanding. I'm guessing the restoration on these prints alone warrants the ""milking of the cash cow"" I highlighted earlier. NB I believe the original negatives were nitrate based and both unstable and in a very poor condition.

For fans, like myself, these are a must have - although, for me, 'The Goldeneye' ranks right up there with 'The Trap' as all time stinker of the series - that said, if you're collecting these movies you'll want this set - just make sure you have enough space left on the shelf for it!",1376438400,4,1654,4.596610169491526

8586246,5,B00CTWSGA8,"Ever since the big movie channels wussed out on showing Charlie Chan movies I have made it my sworn duty to collect the best possible versions of each of the available movies. And, with the exception of the final two and the couple that are ""lost forever,"" this boxed set just about finished my search.

Of these moviesone with Sidney Toller and the others starring Roland Winters in the title roll, I like the first one, Shadows Over Chinatown the best giving it a solid 9.5 stars and the others 9 stars each.

The prints are clean and it appears some time and work went into the mastering of this DVD rather than just scanning an old videotape and slapping things together.",1502928000,,675,4.524590163934426

however, price to high for these old movies.!",1501718400,,142,4.72
8586248,4,B00CTWSGA8,I enjoy these films.  They are short but deliver solid entertainment.  It doesn't seem to matter who plays Chan.  The only drawback to the series is the occasional racial stereotyping.,1494979200,,184,5.066666666666666
