8328170,5,B001NXT2GG,"When Tiffany's DVDs came into my life, I was overwhelmed, not knowing what I was going to eat having recently discovered my gluten intolerance.  As I searched online for recipes, I came up with tons of desserts.  Well, desserts was not what I needed.  I wanted recipes for actual meals.  And good ones!  Easy ones!  And I'm a visual person.  Cooking is like a foreign language, I need to see how it's done.  Then I found Tiffany's DVDs.  Not only do I have all the visuals I need, I also have a cookbook that comes with it.  Tiffany makes cooking extremely easy.  Here DVDs are very informative about why something is good to eat... and they're fun to watch!

My life has been simplified by the knowledge Tiffany provides.  I am relieved to find a tasty, healthy and easy way to eat with no gluten.  I owe it all to Tiffany's DVDs!  I highly recommend them.

You've got to try her Quinoa Flat Bread in the NW edition, it makes a great pizza--- YUM!!",1233187200,2,949,4.367816091954023

8328172,5,B001NXT2GG,This is a great resource for any cook to have on the bookshelf.  Very informative but in a fun light hearted delivery.  Tiffany takes you step by step through the process of cooking the recipes giving helpful information about ingredients and healthy eating along the way.  And I thought that gluten free would mean not getting to eat tasty foods that I like; well Tiffany has proved that wrong!,1231977600,,395,4.695652173913044
8328173,5,B001NXT2GG,"Tiffanys Secrets of GF Cooking SW edition is simply delicious!  I love how she provides ""edible knowledge"" along with instructions on how to prepare the foods.  It is wonderful to combine the visual demonstrations and the audio information, and have the free recipe booklet  (comes with dvd) to help transfer the knowledge into my own kitchen.

In addition to her SW edition, I own her NW edition too.  This series of Gluten Free cooking DVDs are hands down the most helpful resources I have come across for dealing with a gluten free diet.  There are tons of resources out there- cookbooks, articles, products, the list is endless.  When I first started eating gluten free I found this information overload to be completely overwhelming and confusing.  As well, I noticed that the majority of the resources available were designed to simply replace unhealthy glutenous foods with unhealthy non-glutenous.  After trying several of the ""gluten free replacers"" I found that I was just replacing my bad eating habits in a different form.  I learned that eating gluten free does not automatically mean you are eating healthy!  We must consciously choose what to eat... which is when Tiffanys DVDs come in extremely handy as she helps guide you down the path of recovering and cultivating health and promoting wellness and vitality.

As in her NW edition, Tiffany goes beyond merely sharing tasty Southwest recipes and showing you how to prepare them and really ties in her knowledge and experience as a healthcare provider.  She emphasizes nutrition by discussing the healing benefits of foods, the best time of year to eat them and reveals many more secrets of eating for wellness.

I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who is looking for healthy recipes and tasty/easy Southwest dishes!

One last note.. my favorite dishes on this DVD are Tiffany's Navajo Frito Pie and her Pumpkin Seed Mole with Sliced Pear and Jicama.. they are delicious!  Check them out...I know you'll love them too!",1231286400,,1987,4.993920972644377

One of the other great qualities about Tiff's NW DVD is that the recipes are totally delicious and quick/simple to prepare. Don't let the title fool you, even if you don't live in the NW the ingredients are readily available at most health-food stores.

One last note... my favorite recipe on this DVD is her sprouted quinoa flatbread.  It is so delicious!  Great for making a sandwich, with soup or... my favorite... as pizza!  Check it out... I know you'll love it too!",1231200000,,1711,5.003533568904594
