The video was very helpful, easy to understand, and was a joy to watch this lady interact with her beloved Donkeys. I would definitely recommend to the Longear crowd!",1410912000,,252,4.382978723404255
8024718,3,B00029PM0M,"I got this video shortly after I got my donkey.  I've had him for a few years now and we've tried several different training techniques together.  Recently I reviewed this video again to see how helpful it had really been.  I'm glad I viewed it initially.  It did give me some confidence in handling my donkey.  It especially taught me how to approach him and gain his confidence.  So I learned a few things, but not $35 worth.  I've gained much more information on how to train my donkey from reading articles on the internet and viewing YouTube videos.  I expect instructional videos that I purchase to have more staying power; to be of more value to me than one viewing.  Unfortunately, this one does not meet that criteria.  The instructor's manner is very good.  The instructions are clear.  The video is easy to watch and understand.  There is just not a lot of meat to it. You'll learn how to gain your donkey's confidence, how to walk him around a rink, and how to get a saddle on him.  That's about it.  I've discovered there is much more to learn about training a donkey to keep him and everyone else around him safe.",1285545600,3,1127,4.455882352941177
8024719,2,B00029PM0M,"This is a good video for the first time owner. I was disappointed that there wasn't more insight as to how the donkey thinks or interacts or even more history as an opening. The description of the different sizes I think should have been at the begining instead of toward the end. I am a long time horse person who has trained and did not learn a single thing new. What information is on the dvd can be easily found for free via internet searches.

On the plus, Crystal Ward is very clear is not a little too talkative on her process and things going on with what she is instructing.  For the beginner it would be great, for the more knowledgable...look further.",1230508800,2,662,4.373983739837398
8024720,5,B00029PM0M,"I agree with the reviewer from South Carolina. My young donkey is my first equine.  There are few local donkey owners/trainers where I live.  So I looked for training books and videos and found wonderful stuff for people who are planning on showing ... very technical, very good ... but way beyond me, and not what I need to start.  Also, the videos I've seen show you only their successes and usually without the audio.  You can't hear the interaction between person and donkey - a key element.
I was so hungry for something that I could see and hear, showing what to do when everything isn't perfect (most of the time).  After watching ""Donkey Training"" with Crystal Ward, I felt so much better about my donkey and myself ... and so much more relaxed about the whole process.
Why?  You see Crystal work with donkeys that are learning as the tape rolls.  She talks you through her decisions to react or not react to how the donkey is responding.  She suggests options as she goes along, and she always stays calm.  She gives helpful background information.
Also, because this is a dvd, you can find the subject you need easily.
We've made wonderful progess since the dvd arrived and have a great relationship. Donkeys are awesome.
If only Crystal Ward would produce more dvds.  For one thing, my standard donkey is young and I wonder how she works with kicking (luckily my donkey hasn't tried... but what if he does?) and nipping (which he sort of tries to do. I don't let him, but he hasn't stopped mildly trying). I don't know if it's because he's not yet two years old.
I love this dvd.",1218758400,11,1590,4.527972027972028
