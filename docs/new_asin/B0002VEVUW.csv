2124584,5,B0002VEVUW,"I'd read/heard the hype but I'm not one to listen to other people much so, I bought my copy off Amazon and enjoyed the hell out of it. I don't know who's idea it was to feature a board over a surfer but it was genius! As if the board had a life of it's own. The surfers, as talented as they are, took back-seat to ""Yellow"", the real star of the film, and highlights how one board can be ridden in any number of ways on any number of waves (oh, Bongo, that was a steep drop). No inane comments from the competitive surfing peanut gallery, just a short answer to ""Why do you surf?"" was all that was needed to add ""depth"" to one singlefin: yellow. A great flick.",1120694400,18,659,4.038167938931298

Moshe Feldenkrais Dao Mo and Sun Lu Tang give it five stars even though the shaper should have spent more time in the movie riding his cre'a'tion.",1120089600,3,556,4.3431372549019605
2124586,5,B0002VEVUW,"I am a shortboarder who has never riden a longboard or had the want to. This is no more. After having seen this film I want to get a board just like it. This film is genius. It shows the true sprituality and emotions of surfing that keeps those commited to the core going back for more. The board travels around the world to different surfers, who are all just naturally gifted surfers. They talk about their relationship with surfing and what not. Get this film...it honestly is one of my favorite films. Peace, love, and no haters.",1109030400,6,533,4.448979591836735
2124587,5,B0002VEVUW,"Well, this is without a doubt the single best surf film ever made and to be honest, the price on Amazon is much better than you'll find at any surf shop. I paid $30 for my copy (and two copies for a couple of friends).

Jason Baffa (director) has assembled perhaps the most pure piece of cinema on surfing ever. Shot on 16 mm film, the texture is perfect in reflecting the rays of sunlight and the enthusiasm of surfers. It is a longboard film, but applies to all surfers and non-surfers. The board, SingleFin: yellow, refers to a 9'6"" single fin, classic nose rider longboard that is yellow, designed and shaped on film by west coast shaper Tyler Hatzikian (sp?). While creator gives birth to this golden chariot and rides it for the first time, the experience is extended to several other friends around the world for their experience and input. Hence, the most unique surf film ever: The board is the central character.

With loving detail and care, Baffa lets us all in on the shaper's world, the surfer's world and the world of the board only to be reborn (I won't give away too much). It's a psuedo documentary, but the special features with story boards and additional comments shows this was planned all along. It's a masterpiece simply unparalleled in surf film lore.

Singlefin has been building an incredible groundswell of cult following in the past year. One viewing and you'll see why. While there wasn't as much bonus material included in this DVD as, say, Step Into Liguid, the additional stuff is still far more than most surf films that have made it to DVD. Check out the director's commentary, too, as Baffa makes multiple viewings well worth your while with insightful details surrounding the challenges to making the film.

Baffa also plans a pending release of a making of DVD for Singlefin accompanied by a soundtrack CD of the music.

And Oh the music. Folks, this is perhaps the best musical soundtrack ever done for a surf film. I've got Step INto Liquid and Soundtrack and to be honest it's somewhat cliche.

Singlefin has nothing cliche about it and Baffa astutely selected some of the most alternative and progressive west coast artists to set the score for his musical backdrop. Bluebird (yes, a very hardcore band) is featured prominantly but with some of their best and esoteric music ever made from their mystical Black Presence CD. It's progressive and moves the genra forward instead of relying on tired themes. Oma Yang provides the powerful closer on SIngleFin and a plethora of folk and other progressive artists coupled with some original score from Baffa and company provides the clear winner of all time for surf film sounds.

If you love surfing, get this film. If you love good filmmaking, get this film. Baffa provides a sober, clear, serious and spiritually profound look at the world of surfing devoid of cliches that will never be rivaled. It's simply the best surf film ever made.",1097193600,51,2928,4.751968503937008
2124588,5,B0002VEVUW,"Unfortunately, I don't live on either coast, and prior to seeing Singlefin, had only seen commercially-produced ""surfing"" films.  Not only does this posit some great surf philosophy, but it showcases some of the most diverse, skilled surfers the world over - literally.  As a bonafide urban university turnout, I know my indie films.  Overall, film choice was beautiful, production was entirely organic, and the did I mention that it was indie? Don't miss out!",1095984000,3,460,5.1891891891891895
2124589,5,B0002VEVUW,"singlefin: yellow - follows one yellow surfboard around the world as shared by a group of international friends - this unique structure offers new insights into the underground world of surfing - combined with a phenomenal soundtrack and artful cinematography - this arm chair traveler takes the viewer on a unique and fascinating ride - if you love surfing, the ocean or beautiful imagery in poetic motion check out this documentary film -  and share it with your friends.  no surfing knowledge needed - just appreciation for good filmmaking and passionate people. enjoy.",1095811200,2,572,5.139784946236559
2124670,3,B0002VEVUW,"Much of the surfing footage is okay, but the story line is just that, a story line.  I am glad that there is as much surfing in there as there is otherwise it would have been a give away.  It's one of those films I've watched once and may watch again in a few years.  Contrary to Step into Liquid which I watch at least once every three of four months.  Okay, but far from great.",1299628800,,379,3.9473684210526314
2124671,5,B0002VEVUW,"This is a film following a single fin longboard ridden by multiple different surfers from Japan to Hawaii.

Cool intro with the shaper Tyler from El Segundo, CA.

Compared to most surf movies which suffer from serious repetition of the same surfing moves over and over set to questionable music, this movie is actually a movie.

There are interesting characters with good stories. The parts of the movie where the surfers narrate are great, especially the scenes in Japan.

I love the cinematography and attention to detail of the director to make this a watchable film with a cool vibe.

One of my favorite surf films.",1294099200,2,619,4.80188679245283
2124672,1,B0002VEVUW,"I do not surf , but I enjoy watching good films about surfing .
I am sad to say I was very disappointed in this film .
 I can appreciate  the idea behind this film but it was very boring to watch .
Surf films I have watched and enjoyed and rate 4 and 5 are Billabong Odyssey , Riding Giants , Endless Summer 2 and Step into Liquid .",1260230400,,332,3.7285714285714286
2124673,5,B0002VEVUW,"For those who are into longboarding, this is the best film (documentary) I've seem. The photography and music are excellent, the story is very well documented and interesting. Tyler is not only a great shaper but by far the best rider of single fin yellow. It is by far the coolest surfing movie!",1222646400,,296,4.60377358490566
2124674,4,B0002VEVUW,"I actually have not seen the movie and assume it's good based off of Baffa's work on One California Day. I'll get to my review of that movie later.

But, Amazon sent me the product very quickly and I have no complaints. Besides the fact that they sent me the Audio Soundtrack CD instead of the DVD. Crazy thing was that it was in the DVD case! Did they take the DVD out and put the CD in and hope I wouldn't notice when I put it in my DVD player? Seriously? Anyway, sending it back. Thanks for the headache and the time I have to spend out of my day dealing with YOUR mistake Amazon.com. No wonder your stock is plummeting like a lead baloon right now.

Anyway. My review of the film is that I haven't seen it. However, I would reccomend One California Day. That is unless you're a wannabee or a surf-stoked Grom that doesn't care about style, soul, or history when it comes to Surfing. Otherwise you'll love the movie. I promise. Fantastic scenery, surfing, stories, and history. Interviews with Noll, Tudor, Hatzikian. Getting to see Tudor, Skip Frye, and Alex Knost surf their home breaks is amazing. Great music, great cinematography, great flow, just a perfect film. I rank it in my top 5 movies of all time regardless of Genre.",1210982400,,1233,4.427312775330397
2124675,5,B0002VEVUW,"Singlefin-yellow just flat out a good surf movie great story line just not about some dudes ripping on short boards trying to get air on every wave, but a story about a board and the true soul of surfing.",1205539200,,204,4.256410256410256
2124676,1,B0002VEVUW,"Though the package came factory sealed, it would not play after the first minute. It was scratched and unplayable. I have mailed it back and am waiting to hear back.",1205107200,2,165,4.533333333333333
2124677,5,B0002VEVUW,"I love this movie. Unfortunately, Amazon shipped the CD soundtrack in the DVD case instead of the movie DVD. Very disappointed as also I paid for expedited shipping and it arrived very late. So, 5 stars for the movie and 0 stars for a faulty Amazon product and slow shipping!",1194566400,,275,4.52
2124678,5,B0002VEVUW,This is the kind of movie that just makes you smile.  It is thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended.,1192060800,,104,4.777777777777778
2124679,5,B0002VEVUW,The concept of the video in itself is what makes the thing work- really work for me.  The board is passed along to various surfers and you see it take on a life and meaning that it did not have at the beginning.  Its not just a longboarder kind of movie..its a surfers movie that you really should see.  I only have a few surf videos in my personal collection--this is one of them.,1183593600,,381,4.121621621621622
2124730,2,B0002VEVUW,"The movie is cool because it offers different surfing than normally seen in surf movies, but I buy surf films to watch over and over. Which I would not do with this movie. Just not enough action.",1174262400,4,195,4.297297297297297
2124731,5,B0002VEVUW,"Any true surfer will really appreciate this movie.  Great longboarding footage, they make nose-riding look so easy.  The locations are amazing, and the cinemetography is unique....unlike anything I've ever seen before in a surf movie.",1169510400,,234,5.6571428571428575
2124732,2,B0002VEVUW,"I guess for me this is another example of caveat emptor. I bought this largely based on the reviews here, and I was pretty disappointed. The surfing just wasn't that interesting - way way too much nose riding, and not much else. OK nose riding is fine, but there is a lot more about longboarding than hanging 5. The best parts of the movie are the beginning and end - where the shaper describes his work and goes out for an early morning session. Now THAT was great - he ripped, and it was great to see him really using the whole board and the whole wave. I wish the movie had just been about him.",1164672000,7,597,4.155172413793103
2124733,5,B0002VEVUW,"I have had the luxury of having surfed in Hawaii in the late 60s and migrated through the 70s, 80s, 90s and into the 21st century of surfing.  Singlefin is a vintage piece of surfing lore.  This is the sort of film you collect and keep because once the waves are done, they're done.  Singlefin is truly a surfing tale that can be watched again and again.  If you're both a longboarder and shortboarder as I am you can appreciate Surftech technology and bumpy wax beads on a longboard.  Loved the film.  You will too.",1162857600,2,516,4.378947368421053
2124734,5,B0002VEVUW,"I own a lot of surf DVD's, long board,short board,mix of both. What makes Singlefin special from the others is that it really is a surf ""movie"" with a story. Shot on film with great care. ANY surfer will love the pure stoke which moves through out this film. A must for surf DVD collectors who love the life of surfing.",1160697600,2,319,4.245901639344262
2124735,5,B0002VEVUW,"Single Fin: Yellow must be one of the best surf films I have ever seen.  You follow the journey of one board all across the world seeing it surfed by 6 of the world's best longboarders (Beau Young, Devon Howard, Bonga Perkins and others) at their local break which includes australia, california, japan, mexico and hawaii.  Buy this DVD.  If you longboard, you'll love it.  If you surf, you'll sure as hell appreciate it!",1156896000,2,421,4.648648648648648

2124737,5,B0002VEVUW,"This is my absolute favourite film... and that includes all genres! I have watched this about 15 times and I never tire of it. The cinematography and soundtrack are superb and the story is great. Although it is purely longboarding, that doesn't matter because the quality of the surfing is very high and really they could be riding any size of board and it wouldn't take away from the overall vibe of this film. It strikes the perfect balance between surfing and story.",1144800000,11,469,4.662650602409639
2124738,5,B0002VEVUW,"This movie is great. It's got a great idea, look and soundtrack and the surfing is even better. Also don't let the longboarding scare you off if you're not into that type of thing, these guys are charging and they're doing some amazing stuff. I can't think of another recent surf flick where you get to see someone drop a 9'6"" deep into a heavy day at Pipe.",1142380800,5,357,4.264705882352941
2124739,4,B0002VEVUW,"Excellent surfing woven around a tale of this board's 'travels' among talented surfers at vastly different locations.  Great music.  A surf movie with a beginning, a middle , and an end to the story!",1142294400,,199,4.823529411764706

8032837,5,B0002VEVUW,"This is probably my 4th copy of this DVD.  I have the habit of lending it to friends and then never get it back.  But no worries, better to share the love.  Yes, love!!
