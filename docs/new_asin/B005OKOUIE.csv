4853955,1,B005OKOUIE,"I was hoping this would be a decent 3D demo to enjoy and show to friends, but wow... What a waste of money. A full hour of staring at uninteresting bushes and rocks. I started to fast forward through it a bit to see if it got any better, and it didn't. If you want to see bushes and rocks in 3D, step outside your front door and save yourself $20. To the maker of this video, you could have at least waited until fall to film this so it would at least have been colorful!",1291075200,29,471,3.9166666666666665
4853956,4,B005OKOUIE,This Blu-Ray has excellent 3d effects. It is pretty much as described. Mostly excellent quality at a great price. Good quality background music,1353110400,3,143,5.260869565217392

4853958,3,B005OKOUIE,"One of the great things about 3D TV are the 'Specially produced 3D movies""
They really bring that cinematic experience to your home.  This 3D video
is a good demo to show off your new 3DTV especially if you like trees, brooks
and rivers suffused with new age music.",1347148800,3,265,4.408163265306122
4853959,3,B005OKOUIE,"Very important that if you purchase this 3d dvd you know what to expect. No action...none..the company that produced this dvd makes ""relaxing"" dvds and that is exactly what this is meant to do...relax you. Very scenic forest streams,trees in 3d,ect plus relaxing music put me to sleep !! The Magic Forest is actually a pretty forest with soothing music in 3d. I would've liked some animal life somewhere in the dvd,but then again,the producers probably figured out that animals or insects woul've kept people awake,not relaxed. For the price and to add to 3d collection,its worth the gamble.",1345248000,5,591,4.97979797979798
4853960,5,B005OKOUIE,This 3D DVD was really nice. I just got a 3D tv and wanted to have something to watch on it. The 3D effects were not overpowering but pretty and the music was relaxing. I would recommend it,1343174400,4,189,4.0
4853961,5,B005OKOUIE,"I read some of the reviews on here and i saw the bad ones, and i was shocked at there stupidity. THIS FILM IS A BEAUTIFUL FILM THAT CAN HELP YOU RELAX!

4853962,5,B005OKOUIE,"This was an amazing 3D Blu Ray. The scenery in this Blu Ra really brought me back to when I was a kid playing with my friends at the creek everyone hung out at. The showings of the streams and creek beds was really nostalgic for me. The Music in it was amazing, and the scenery was amazing as well, the only bad thing I would say is that it features some scenes in a Cave and in an open field...which didn't really fit the whole ""Magical Forest"" thing, but with that being said I still enjoyed the blu ray. Highly suggested!",1338940800,5,524,4.147058823529412

4853964,1,B005OKOUIE,"I just got a 3D DVD player for my 3D TV. I just wanted something to watch and Magic Forrest made me think it's animation or something magical like Lord of the Rings or something. But alas, it's just scenes from real forests and scenes from random places like theme parks. You will not watch it and people will hate you if you show your friends your new toy.",1335139200,3,357,4.188405797101449
4853965,5,B005OKOUIE,"This is the first 3D dvd I purchased for my 3D tv (I also had to purchase a 3D/BluRay capable dvd player) and I have to say, I was blown away!  The cover picture is somewhat misleading; this is not magic, nor is it new-agey, or have fairies, elves or anyone else. It is truly like a walk through the woods on a beautiful summer day while you're listening to calm, soothing music on your iPod.  No people in this short (about 45 minutes) movie, but there are bugs that I actually thought were in my family room and tried to swat.  I spent some time ducking out of the way of hanging branches, etc., so thankfully I was alone the first time I saw it. Being a 3D neophyte, I had no idea that there was a setting for the left and the right views.  I had the left/right settings reversed and consequently was initially unimpressed with the movie and/or 3D technology, but the dvd includes a short test video to set it accurately.  If you're looking for action, you won't find it here.  It is simply a relaxing and wonderful way to view 3D tv and I love it.  I use it to show off the fabulous 3D technology without committing my guests to a couple hours of full length movie, and to decompress after a stressful/rainy/cold (take your pick) day.",1334966400,21,1238,4.28755364806867
4853966,2,B005OKOUIE,"Beautiful Cinematography, with great 3D effects. But a little boring.
with their talent for such stunning cinematography they could have added some action to make it more interesting.

4853969,4,B005OKOUIE,"I thought the film was very enjoyable enough for those who do love nature and I never got
bored with it at all; but are not to be said to some of those rubbish movies on nature, these days.
The 3D effects are as good as anyone with a today's 3D camera such as at the cutting-edge of
technology of Canon, Fujifilm, JVC, Panasonic or Sony can create; even that the zooming
facilities on these cameras are somewhat limited; and , hence you won't see too many 3D
effects coming out of your screen to hit you as you would like them to.
This film is a documentary and has his own right with a good soundtrack even it is more or
less made from a remixed of various tunes; and I won't go further into this film's details but
just to recommend it via Amazon.com to you all  ""Nature Lovers"" for a clean & relaxing
viewing away from violent and other sordid types of movies.  My rating is a 4 Star.",1307491200,6,887,4.151162790697675
4853970,1,B005OKOUIE,I returned it because I thought it was a 3d movie and got to reading about it and found out it was mainly music. I returned it without any problems.,1305676800,,148,3.966666666666667
4853971,3,B005OKOUIE,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D.

There are over 20 out of screen effects that extend 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. At least 14 reached 25%. Very good 3D through out. Out of screen effects are mainly branches and bushes other than the horse heads at 37 1/2 minutes which at times approach 25%.

Parallax is pushed to the limit through out and exceeded in a few scenes.

*** Beautiful but somewhat boring subject matter without narration lowered my rating ***

MY 3D RATING = GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

The 3D Blu-ray is fantastic and looks great on my TV with none of these problems but this is not 3D Blu-ray and I am not sure how this could look good or what the intended purpose of this format and content are.

4853978,1,B005OKOUIE,"This movie is rotten, filmed with a cheap 3-D camera, movements are blurry, it has 3-D effects but not that good, hurts the eyes because of the poor quality.  This was something done on a dollar budget and apparently put together because of the lack of 3-D movies.  I would return this if I could and haven't watched it all the way through - IT IS THAT BAD.

4853982,4,B005OKOUIE,"There are clearly other opinions about this disc, but (and just my opinion) they seem to be missing the most important point... This disc contains the Best 3D nature footage released on Blu-ray to date.  Branches hang well into your livingroom while long rows of forest life extend deep into the distance.  There is huge depth in this footage.  And that, to me, is the goal of the Blu-ray 3D format.

Now, regarding the question of is this a ""Blu-ray 3D"" disc?  The answer is YES.  There are multiple modes within the Blu-ray 3D format: a checkered board 3D, above/below 3D (which is what is included on this disc) and side-by-side 3D.  The checkered board format is the best and used most of commonly in Blu-ray 3D releases, but the others also look great on a quality HDTV.  The Cable companies, as they make the services available, use the above/below 3D and side-by-side 3D in their 3D Cable channels and 3D On-Demand channels.  And, there are a couple of Japanese Blu-ray 3D titles that boast that they have the side-by-side mode.  Just make sure that your HDTV supports the various modes, and you're good to go.  All modes will work with your new 3D glasses and 3d Blu-ray player.

There is one other thing you should know.  This disc is a BD-R and not a BD disc.  Not too big of a deal because Most (maybe all) Blu-ray players now play BD-R's without a second thought.  The surprise is, with it being a BD-R, it has the look of a back-up copy instead of an original product.  Just worth mentioning.

Hope that clears up some ""stuff"".  Anyway, that's it.  If you are looking to show off the depth of your 3D HDTV, this is a good disc to check out.  I do not know or work for anyone affiliated with this title or disc.",1292025600,5,1723,4.426751592356688
4853983,1,B005OKOUIE,"This Bluray disc is not a fancy normal bluray 3D one. It looks a home made disc using BD-R burnt by a bluray burner equipped in a home computer. My popular Samsung BD-C6900 3D blu-ray player with latest firmware doesn't recognize it at all. The seller at Amazon was unable to contact. I got no reply from them. The cover and insert were like ones printed by an inkjet printer. Be careful of water damage on the surface of it.

Pro - low price, mysterious look, hopeful expectation
Con - Unable to see the content, No response from the seller

Even if you received it as a gift, you wouldn't be grateful. I regret Amazon doesn't have a negative rating system. Be aware!!",1291939200,6,669,4.430894308943089
4853984,2,B005OKOUIE,"Although this is 3D content on a Blu-Ray disc, I wouldn't classify it as a Blu-Ray 3D.  The two formats available on it are only for Green Magenta glasses, or above/below.  The FBI logo at the beginning is only regular DVD resolution (can't read the banner at below the shield, as one can with 1080p or 720p resolutions).  Viewing with the Green-Magenta glasses gives fuzzy images).  The above/below format supposedly works with 3D TVs, but I'm not sure it works with sequential 120Hz displays.  My setup is a DLP 3D Ready projector attached to my PC.  I'm using CyberLink's PowerDVD 10 to view Blu-Ray 3D content and it works on each of the other 7 Blu-Ray 3Ds that I currently have.  The resolution of the above/below format m2ts files is 1920 by 1080, so the actual vertical resolution is only 540.  I'm in the process of converting the main m2ts file to a wmv file so I can view it using nVidia's Stereoscopic Player.

I have no problem with the content, but I'm dubious that it meets standards as a Blu-Ray 3D disc.

The product arrived from Amazon two days earlier than expected, and actually was shipped weeks earlier than predicted by Amazon.

4853985,2,B005OKOUIE,"The photography is quite unique, interesting, & creative.  The flattering & optimistic description of this Blu-ray 3D on the product jacket itself, states  ""Recommended Usage: This wonderful collection of DVD's are recommended for many different uses such as background for a conversation, medical & other waiting rooms, wellness centers, saunas, as a sleep aid, etc.""

Somehow that seems illogical considering that 3D glasses of one type or another MUST be used to view the product...& they suggest having a conversation, or using it in a waiting room, or a sauna, or as a sleep aid...with everyone wearing 3D glasses????  How ridiculous would that be?  For the stated purposes, one might as well just use a music CD or perhaps a 2D Blu-ray. The latter does NOT seem to be an option within, or even separately from, this 3D-only product.

There was another issue which caused me to reflect on having purchased this product, to wit, occasionally when the camera slowly panned either vertically or horizontally, the focus (sharpness/detail) in parts of the scene sometimes would be sharp, then deteriorate, & then recover during the pan.  That has never happened with any other 3D source material I have ever viewed on my Panasonic plasma 3D TV(TC-P65VT25).

The background music IS relaxing, especially of you turn off the TV picture & just listen, however, for the stated recommended usage, it would be best for this to be a 2D product.  I wish I had known & not paid a premium for an impractical Blu-ray 3D.  I doubt that I will ever take it off my bottom shelf from now on.",1291075200,13,1576,4.847014925373134
8481536,1,B005OKOUIE,I am really into 3D and have made several purchases on a whim. Some have been very rewarding and some are pure garbage. This falls into the latter category. Essentially this is very repetitive b-roll that looks like it was shot in 2D a long time ago that has been poorly converted and even more poorly edited together. It's super repetitive and will make you continually regret your purchase with each second that rolls by.,1522108800,,423,4.653333333333333
