8681047,4,B00NYA0EJ0,"This is pretty much the best value you can find for these 3 often overlooked cannibal films, if you're looking to expand or complete your collection. While Grindhouse or Shriek Show have released the majority of these films, these 3 come from Severin. PAPAYA in particular is rather hard to come by on its own at this time, so if you're a completionist it may be worth the price tag just for that film alone.

In terms of cinematic quality, well, they're Spanish cannibal/jungle movies. Cannibal Terror is extremely derivative of more infamous (and superior) films like Cannibal Ferox, but is much, much easier to stomach morally. To the best of my recollection, in fact, there is no animal violence at all in this set.

PAPAYA has only one scene depicting cannibalism and fits more into the softcore genre, with a environmentalist message and setting that evokes the cannibal genre. It's one of Joe D'Amato's weaker films, but again, if you need to own it (I did), this is your best bet.

Devil Hunter is a Jess Franco romp and includes his usual tropes. It's a strange movie for the genre it's appearing in. It actually has a lot more in common with monster movies at its core, but has the cannibal tropes you'd come to expect- natives, rituals, and a little bit of flesh eating.

Quality-wise, the films aren't pristine, but I'm honestly grateful just to have the opportunity to see them in the US without tape trading. Sound isn't impeccable either, but to the best of my knowledge these are complete, uncut prints.

If you're looking for an entry point into the cannibal genre or understanding how the films ""work"", don't start here. These are mostly peripheral movies to the main story of the genre and 2 of the films are more cannibal flavored than actual cannibal movies. Still, if you're a completionist, collector, or have an understanding of the starting points of the genre and want to explore deeper, I can't recommend this set highly enough.",1430438400,6,1955,4.755162241887906

8681049,5,B00NYA0EJ0,I watched all this and enjoy the thrill on this gender style of films the also call them stomach turners not to me even though films have gotten bloodier then some of past ones but good to watch.,1419206400,2,195,4.157894736842105
