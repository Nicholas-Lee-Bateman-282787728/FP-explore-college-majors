Ranges from the laughably (unintentionally) nonsensical to the downright ludicrous; while you're watching the seemingly interminable ending you'll find your jaw stuck open in amazement at the sheer unbelievability of it all. You know a movie like this is in trouble when you find yourself fast-forwarding through the stripper routines. It may or may not be obvious who the killer is, but by the end you just don't care.  Horribly acted and directed, indifferently written (with the classic line - ""Would you rather be with a killer or a dyke"" - or something like that). Yes, one does not expect miracles from a slasher film, but at least give it a little effort. If there is any interest at all, it's seeing Lisa Kudrow in a pre-Friends early small role.",1417478400,2,766,4.803030303030303
8073339,1,B000A2XAOQ,"A blessedly minor cinema genre concerns policewomen or female journalists who work ""undercover"" as strippers or prostitutes in order to gather information concerning either criminal or newsworthy activities, and with this sexploitative affair it is a journalist who assumes the double duty. Reporter Kelly Crosby (Barbara Alyn Woods) supposes that a clandestine vocation as a stripteaser will enhance her stalled newspaper career and she persuades her editor (Drew Snyder) to allow her secondary employment at the sleazy Bottoms Up Club in Los Angeles, following homicides of two strippers who worked there, as Kelly believes that she will possibly locate clues at the club if she doffs everything for her night job. Numerous characters scented of red herring are introduced amid many tiresome scenes depicting augmented flesh of indifferent quality, as the plucky newspaperwoman attempts, with assistance from vice sergeant Shaughnessy (Maxwell Caulfield) who has entered the picture as her lover to determine the identity of the killer. Because homicides of ecdysiasts persist, and since nearly each personage with a speaking part is clumsily signified as a potential suspect, an element of suspense might be expected to appear, but this production fails to deliver on that score as a viewer in a semi-comatose state should yet have no difficulty in selecting the killer. The scenario, in particular its dialogue, is insultingly puerile, easily finding ways to include an overage of cliches within its framework, and the acting is largely unskillful, with the exception of Lisa Kudrow, near the beginning of her career in a small part as a press room worker and friend of Kelly. A positive element of this extraordinarily poor film is the output of its sound crew, but otherwise there is nothing to commend it, from its wretched direction and continuity through its total ignorance of even the most basic law enforcement procedures as evidenced by Caulfield's (dismal) performance, to the excruciating and seemingly endless climactic scene, silly to the nth, almost as if those responsible are venturing to make it as incongruous as is possible.",1132185600,,2147,5.355029585798817
8073340,2,B000A2XAOQ,"A fair movie for a slasher, which I generally don't like.  I originally got this video because of one of the cast-Cat Sassoon.  She plays the part of a exotic dancer-she does have the body for it who unfortunately gets  killed off by the middle of the movie.  Unfortunately she does not do any  martial arts in this movie.  Basically the plot is a little sparse but the  dancers are cute. I'll probably watch it a second time but it's nowhere  near Angel Fist.",963100800,4,460,4.392857142857143
