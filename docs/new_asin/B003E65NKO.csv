I finished watching it, I had to rewind the movie to start watching it again for the second time in one sitting because it is that great. To say this movie have all the quality that the movie of the year should have is simply an understatement. Even the title itself justified the gold stars deserving movie. I am not Indian, but this kind of Bollywood entertainment is fiercely a great edge and motivation for me and any other international fellow that this film is deserving to be watched. The movie is not solely all about entertainment, it also teaches a good moral lesson in life. Ever since I watched this movie, I never have any regret.",1296950400,4,727,4.557251908396947

Sunny Deol is a cop who suffers an injury to his spinal cord while apprehending a known criminal which confines him to wheelchair for life. He soon discovers that his wife Esha Koppikar is cheating on him with his brother. Upset with the events, he hatches an elaborate plan to kill them both and claim the 5 crore insurance amount. The only person that stands in his way is his inspector buddy Irfan Khan. This was a thin plot from the opening reel and it fails to hold your interest partly because the viewer knows what is going to happen in the last reel. Another reason this movie fails is because the movie has poor production values in fashion, furnishings, and locations. Sunny Deol proves that he still has the chops for acting and Irfan Khan is ok but the movie is all wrong. One star. 10/15/10",1287878400,,1063,4.541666666666667
