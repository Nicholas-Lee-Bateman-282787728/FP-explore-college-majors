8643499,5,B001PS1IRU,"My 6 year-old son loves origami.  Since we received these videos, he has watched them through several times each.  He enjoys making origami for his grandparents, teachers, and friends.  Sometimes the video goes a little fast, so you have to pause it while you make your folds.  Overall we are very pleased with this purchase!",1315958400,,325,4.8545454545454545
