5924092,5,B00EK2P3VA,"I am an avid fitness DVD consumer and this is by far one of the best that I have tried!  There are TEN pre-mixes that include cardio, upper body, lower body and abs.  You can choose short or long premixes and choose to include the warm up and cool down or not.  Angie is a great instructor.  Very good cues and clear instruction. It is like working out with a friend.  I got a great workout and will never get bored with all of the pre-mixes!  Great job Angie!!",1381795200,3,461,4.123595505617978
5924093,5,B00EK2P3VA,"As a physical therapist and certified strength and conditioning specialist I love that Angie offers low impact modifications for each exercise, making it a safe form of cardio and strength training for my patients.  On a personal level, the busy mother in me loves the pre-mixes and workout options she offers so I can pick the right series of exercises everyday depending on the amount of time I have to workout.  I think Angie has the most organized, well-designed menu in the industry.  The workout is amazing, I am dripping with sweat each time (although my low-impact patients can choose the less intense version of each move), and the benefits of the exercise stay with me long after the DVD is over.  My husband just commented on my newly-toned triceps tonight and I have never gotten a better inner thigh workout in my entire life.  I have even incorporated some of her moves into the treatment plans I give my patients.  Thank you, Angie!!!",1381536000,2,949,4.7560975609756095
5924094,5,B00EK2P3VA,"I love this DVD! This is my favorite of hers so far. The Menu is great, it has 5 short workouts and 5 long workouts and you can target different body parts on different days. It also has an option to skip the warmup (sometimes I'll go for a run and then come in and do a workout). The lower body calorie torcher is incredible, I was dripping sweat the entire time and could barely walk the next day. There are some great tricep and ab exercises I've never seen before. There is one move where you lay down and hold the weights above your head, and it REALLY worked my triceps, it felt great. The workouts are tough (intermediate-advanced) depending on how much weight you use. She uses a step, but there is a modifer that shows it without the step as well. Beginners could probably do this too and just use lighter weights and follow the modifications. The arm exercises are a killer! The moves are athletic style moves (no fancy dancing or anything) and she uses a combination of cardio, body resistance and weights. She also has a back-up person who has knee problems that doesn't go as low and modifies some of the moves. There is a count down timer for each of the exercises, and Angie really helps you push through those last sets when you want to quit! I loved her first two DVDs, but this one has a better production quality for those who care about those type of things. I do a TON of DVDs and this DVD has just floated to the top of my list!",1381363200,3,1450,4.276363636363636
5924095,5,B00EK2P3VA,As a busy mom I don't have a lot of time to workout at home. The great thing about this video is it gives you so many different workout options. I can choose a quick cardio workout or mix it up with strength. It allows me to maximize my time by getting the most total body workout. It really isolates those areas you want to work on.  It was challenging but it does give you modifications which was very helpful.  You also don't need a lot of fancy equipment and the menu is very user friendly. You won't get bored with all the options it has to offer!!,1388188800,2,553,4.111111111111111
5924096,4,B00EK2P3VA,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the instructor.

This is my first exposure to certified group fitness instructor Angie Gorr, although she has had several prior DVD releases, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-50-Cardio-and-Weights/dp/B007UPU24W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50/50 Cardio and Weights</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cardio-and-Strength-Interval-Circuit-Workout/dp/B005LDH3M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cardio and Strength Interval Circuit Workout</a>.  Interestingly, Gorr's web site explains that she is NOT a full-time instructor; rather, she works as a system analyst, but she has relied on exercise and holistic medicine to manage the chronic health problems that have plagued her since her late teens.

ULTIMATE SWEAT & TONE is a high reps, low weights workout.  It is definitely geared towards advanced exercisers--the full routine is 85 minutes long!--but is suitable for higher intermediate levels and above.  The equipment used includes dumbbells, a step, and a mat for the floorwork.  Gorr works out with two background exercisers, one of whom shows modifications without the step.  Because the cardio featured in this workout is high impact, Gorr herself will briefly demonstrate a lower-impact alternative, but no one consistently performs the low impact modification.  However, the cardio moves are athletic in style and easy-to-follow:  each cardio sequence is just two minutes long, broken up into 30-second segments.

The Amazon listing provides screen shots of the different menus included on this DVD; this setup offers users a wide variety of options.  I will list these and then provide more information on the individual exercises below.
MAIN MENU:
* Introduction

The descriptions above are as listed on the on-screen menus.  For both the Long and Short Pre-Mixes, there is the option of including the Warm-Up (3.5 minutes) or leaving it off simply by unchecking it onscreen.  The warm-up features side-to-side steps, marches, basic steps on bench, taps on bench, jogs, heel jacks, punches side to side, and squats with a side leg raise.  All of the workouts finish with a short (<4 minutes) cool-down/stretch sequence that is performed mostly on the floor.  The stretches include seated reach for toes, butterfly, cat/cow on knees, lying one-legged quad stretch, and then coming to standing to stretch the hamstrings, triceps, forearms, and shoulders.

The individual exercises submenu is broken down into three categories, Lower Body, Upper Body, and Abs, and it includes all of the exercise segments that are featured on the DVD.  I have provided brief details of each item listed on the menu below, including times for each segment, whether the segment includes cardio, and a description of the exercises.

LOWER BODY:
* Leg Tap (right leg) [9.27 min]  fast-paced toning followed by cardio moves
Starting with the right foot on the bench. Gorr performs knees up, kicks front, side knees up, and then a turned out kick front.  She does three sets of each exercise and then moves through a ""power"" set, one set of each.  This is followed by approximately four minutes of cardio, including jogs, step-ups, side-hops, and side touches over the bench.
* Leg Tap (left leg) [9.27 min]  fast-paced toning followed by cardio moves
The entire sequence above is repeated, starting with the left foot on the bench.
* Inner Thighs [4:02 min]  toning only
This section begins with pulsing plis.  Gorr adds dumbbells, taking the plis deeper.  She then varies the movement with climbers (reaching up as if climbing a rope, then sinking down deeper), and twist and pulls towards either foot.  Again, she performs three sets of each exercise and then a ""power"" set.
* Lunges [10:11 min]  cardio plus toning
Gorr opens this segment with two minutes of cardio.  The moves include modified frog jumps, ski jumps, curtseys, and side-to-side hopovers.  The lunges are performed without the step and using weights.  Gorr starts the sequence all on one side, performing pulses, knee ups, optional front kick, pulse holds, two down-two up, and mini pulses.
* Leg Push Off Bench [10:57 min]  cardio plus toning
This segment also starts with two minutes of cardio.  Here Gorr performs bench touches, high knees, a second round of bench touches, and bench taps/jumprope on bench.  The leg push movement is another version of knee lifts with one foot on the bench; Gorr varies the tempo fast/slow and also adds the option of kicks.  She does the same three sets of eight and then one power set.
* Floorwork [6:02]  toning only
Coming to lying on the back with the feet on the bench, Gorr performs various bridge moves, including pulses, tempo variations, one leg, and leg up-down-in-out.
UPPER BODY
* Shoulders [6:11]  toning only
Gorr emphasizes that you will need low weights for the shoulders, which are high rep and intense.  She moves through upright rows, front raises, front raise with pull backs, v-raises, overhead press, chest squeeze, running arms, and then clapping hands to finish, performing the usual three sets of eight and then a final power set.
* Triceps [6:23]  toning only
This was a unique series that really hit the triceps.  Gorr starts with triceps dips off the step, adding one leg variations.  She then stays seated on the step for overhead triceps press but ups the challenge with pulses and isometric holds.  Next, she comes to the floor for a really tough series of pulses and holds with the dumbbell positioned just above the eyes.  The entire sequence is repeated once.
* Back/Chest [6:23]  toning only
In this section, Gorr moves through rear delt raises, straight arm rear raises, rear flies, and pulsing rows.  She then moves to the floor for push-ups, alternating between eight singles, four doubles, three sets.
* Biceps/Calves [3:53]  toning only
It would be hard to go too heavy here, as Gorr does pulsing moves for the biceps and adds calf pulses at the same time.  She starts with traditional bicep curls but changes things up, moving through hammer curls and side bicep curls, continuing calf raises the entire time.  Next comes the option of performing the calf raises off the side of the step while moving through the same bicep series, and finally, simply stretching the calves while still working the biceps.
ABS
* Play All Abs
* Planks [3:11]  toning only
Here Gorr begins with the feet on the bench for a series of plank variations, including knees in and legs to the side.
* Pulses with Side Twist [5:27]  toning only
The first move in this section is sort of a modified version of the Pilates hundred in a v-sit position.  Remaining in the v-sit, Gorr performs side-to-side twists using a dumbbell.  She also holds the dumbbell overhead, raising one leg up to meet it.  The entire sequence is repeated once.
* Up & Twist [2:47]  toning only
For this section, Gorr begins lying with the legs raised perpendicular in a slight v-position, performing a crunch with a twist and hold.  The next move is similar to the double leg stretch from Pilates.

I really liked the flexibility of this workout.  When I'm exercising, I often mix-and-match segments from different DVDs to customize to suit my needs on a given day, and the excellent menus and chaptering on this DVD make that easy for me.  I also like the many little unique twists that Gorr adds to the moves--I thought that both the triceps and pli work was particularly unusual and effective.  But there were a few things that I didn't like as well.  First, I didn't like that the cardio segments were not separately chaptered from the strength work.  Because of this, it is difficult to choose a ""strength only"" workout from the pre-mix menu--i.e., you have to know which segments contain cardio if you are trying to avoid them.  A second issue is that with the exception a single longer pre-mix for the lower body, there are no ""split"" pre-mixes that focus on upper or lower body alone.  You can create your own by choosing the individual workout segments, but this seems to be an oversight.  Finally, it was disappointing that one of the modifiers didn't show low-impact modifications throughout the workout.  I modified most of the impact on my own, but I think most viewers would appreciate ongoing modifications.

Despite the few minor flaws, the versatility of this DVD is a major asset.  For this reason, I know that I will get a lot of use out of it, and I would definitely recommend it, particularly for high intermediate exercisers and above.",1384041600,2,9778,5.126182965299685
5924097,5,B00EK2P3VA,"To provide some background before I give my review, I am:

1) A 33 year old mom of two children
2) An advanced exerciser who has been exercising with fitness DVDs since 2003
3) A fitness DVD enthusiast.  My collection includes 200 or so fitness dvds including Cathe, the Firm, Amy Bento, Tracey Staehle, Ballet Body, Pure Barre, Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels
4) A fan of simple, athletic cardio paired with strength training
5) An exerciser who gets bored doing the same thing every day.  I need variety!

I recently had the opportunity to review Angie Gorr's ""Ultimate Sweat and Tone.""  Before I received it, I was able to email Angie for further details about the workout, as she was a completely new instructor to me.  Angie told me her cardio style is straightforward and athletic and she has been compared in that respect to Jari Love.

When I received the DVD, I decided to pop it in the next day, without previewing it, and I completed the entire 85 minute workout from start to finish.  Yes, I did! But, you don't have to! ""Ultimate Sweat and Tone"" offers numerous ways that you can do the workout, whether it be a shorter premix, a longer premix, the entire DVD - whatever you want to do, it is up to you.  Prior to writing this review, I have done the entire workout three times, plus the first 50 minutes of the workout as well as a 62 minute lower body premix that incorporated cardio and lower body.

First of all, what you need! You need weights and a mat.  A step bench is optional.  The strength moves are innovative and endurance based so trust me when I say you will use much lighter weights that you typically do.  For example, I use 20 lb. dumbbells to do bicep curls or overhead shoulder press when I am doing 6-10 reps per set.  In Angie's workout, my weights are 3 lbs and 5 lbs.  No, that is not a typo! The strength moves are endurance based, which means you do a lot of them.  Think 3-6 minutes of a specific body part, such as shoulders, triceps, or biceps.  The step bench, as Angie states, is mainly used for cardio drills and strength work.  You can easily follow Angie's modifier who does the workout without using a bench.  But, just because she is modifying without a bench doesn't mean she is doing an easy version, by any means.  Just try and do 5-6 minutes of endurance strength work with 8 lb dumbbells as she does!

You are going to want to eat your Wheaties (ok, drink your protein shake!) before doing this workout.  It is what I would consider advanced, however, do not let that scare you away.  You can easily start where you start, by doing a premix that is appropriate for your fitness level and modifying when you need to.  I am an advanced exerciser and I modify a couple of the moves to better suit my fitness level and ability.

The workout really does work your entire body with strength training.  Each body part is very thoroughly worked, but I will state that the lower body, which is a problem area for many, has the strongest emphasis.  There are many traditional exercises in this workout that you have seen and done before, such as a plie, squat, lunge or deadlift.  However, Angie adds unique twists to them, such as a faster paced deadlift with an isometric hold, or the plie segment where you ""climb the rope"" and ""slide back down"" as well as pulse plies.  The first leg segment will fatigue your legs immediately, with non weighted movements on the step.  (They reminded me of the blasts in Cathe's ""Low Max"" dvd).

Cardio is incorporated throughout the workout and includes butt kicks, high knees, jump ropes, running up and down off the step, mogul jumps and jumping curtsy lunges.

Upper body work also includes innovative moves.  The pacing and sequence of certain exercises, such as the tricep track, will have your arms burning and screaming at you! I never expected holding a 5 lb. dumbbell in a tricep hold with pulses would burn as much as it did!

There are several ab sections throughout the workout which include traditional and pilates based moves.  The planks with your feet on the step and knee pulses were exceptionally brutal.

Angie is upbeat, encouraging and motivational.  She seemed really real and down to earth to me and I appreciated her instructional style and emphasis on modifying if needed.  She even modified a few of the exercises.

The only suggestions I have are better music (the music was techno style and not really memorable) and to incorporate a stretch segment after each weights track.

This is a really fun workout and so versatile.  I look forward to trying Angie's two other workouts and I have already incorporated ""Ultimate Sweat and Tone"" into my weekly workout rotation.  Coincidentally (or not!) I have lost several inches and noticed some amazing shoulder and bicep definition particularly since starting this workout.",1383609600,2,4828,4.611957796014068
5924098,4,B00EK2P3VA,"Note: I received this DVD free in exchange for a review

This can either be used as a long and very challenging workout (85+ mins) for when you're feeling really ambitious, or you can choose a premix as short as 30 minutes (plus warmup and cooldown) if you're short on time or want to focus on cardio or specific strength areas.  Angie offers calm instruction, good form pointers and modifications, and she takes ability into account for each move.  She is encouraging about working up to the harder levels of the exercises.

There is a helpful countdown timer on the screen so you know how long you'll be working.  For most exercises it counts down for one side then resets when you switch your lead.

Angie's counting is a bit off, which I tended to notice on the more intense moves.  She starts with higher reps and then repeats the moves but says you'll only do 8.  I count when I'm tired and here and there the counting was uneven because she was talking and lost track herself.  Maybe 2-4 reps off every now and then.

I did whole workout one day to see how it would feel and apart from working HARD, I noticed that it took longer than 85 mins.  This was mostly due to having to rearrange my workout space for various sections - moving the step and mat, changing weights.  Some sections had the step removed, some had it sideways, sometimes the mat was in front of or to the side of the step.  I like to match what I see on the screen, so it added time (and I might have needed a recovery!).

I found the triceps section to be tough - light weights but lots of reps plus dips.  Very intense.  Biceps were worked with calves (which I felt more than the biceps, must go heavier next time). Shoulders were also intense (I think I'd dropped my 3 lb weights by the end), chest and back were combined but chest was only worked with pushups.  I really felt my upper back muscles the next day.

Cardio was intense at times but changed every 30 seconds so it felt more manageable.

I liked Angie's friendliness throughout this DVD, especially when you finish one side she acknowledges how hard it was by assuring you that she'll get you through the other side.",1383609600,,2157,4.3879093198992445
5924099,4,B00EK2P3VA,"I consider myself to be an intermediate/advanced exerciser who normally works out 5 - 6 days a week. I like to mix things up to keep the muscles guessing and too not get bored.

Angie seems to be very comfortable in front of the camera.  She is very encouraging and upbeat without being annoying.

I choose to do the whole 85 minutes of this workout and found the time went by fast.  It does have several premixes of various lengths that range from 30 to 85 min for days when you would like a shorter workout. I would rate this an int/advanced endurance type workout which can be modified up or down depending on your weight selection and the height of your step, if you choose to use one.  You also have the option to select an exercise from the upper, lower or abs section if you want to work a certain body part.

The DVD doesn't have music off button for those who like to play your own music.  It does have a timer on the lower right hand side showing how much time is left for each muscle worked.  This is a nice feature as it helps you to push through to the end when your muscles are fatigued and you know you only have a little time left.

Two things that did bother me about the video was the beat of the music was too fast for the warm up, and the warm up was very fast paced.  I had to go at my own pace and not look at the TV for that section.  I also did some extra stretching at the end of the workout as I felt I need to stretch my legs more than Angie showed in the workout.

All in all I think this is a great endurance workout if someone is looking to add more light weights too their workout collection.  It's a nice addition with lots of variety and can easily be modified harder or easier to fit you fitness level.",1382918400,,1736,4.055718475073314
5924100,4,B00EK2P3VA,"~~Please note that I received a free copy of this workout from Angie Gorr to review. ~~

This is my first workout from Angie Gorr, but I know it won't be my last!  As a bit of background, I consider myself an advanced exerciser, and I own about 350 workout DVDs.  I love trying out new programs and instructors, and was excited to try out this new workout.  It's a really fun workout that has a lot of versatility; I'd say that it is geared towards the intermediate and low-advanced exerciser.

When you go to the main screen, you have several options to choose from:

--Introduction
--About Angie
--Short Pre-Mixes (30-48 minute workouts)
--Long Pre-Mixes (50-85 minute workouts)
--Play Entire Workout (88 minutes)
--Select Individual Exercises

There are ten pre-mixes total, which gives you an amazing amount of versatility.  Five of the pre-mixes are for the shorter workouts and ten are for the longer ones.  When you go to one of the sub-menus for the pre-mixes, there is a breakdown not only of how long the pre-mix is, but also what areas (such as thighs, chest, etc.) that that pre-mix focuses on.  Additionally, there is a box on the right-hand side of the screen that you can un-check if you don't want to do the warm-up.  Each pre-mix uses the same warm-up, so it would have been nice if perhaps there were a few warm-ups to choose from, just to add a bit more variety.

To do the workouts, you'll need a step and a range of dumbbells.  One of the modifiers does the workout without a step bench, but you'll definitely get a better workout if you do have a step.

The workouts tend to follow a circuit format, where you do some cardio for a bit, and then add in some weights exercises.  Studies show that this kind of training is best for fat loss, and I find that it also makes a workout less repetitious when the instructor changes it up like this.  A countdown timer also pops up during the workout for certain segments, like during the lunge series or while lifting weights to work the back.

There are two background exercisers in the workout:  a modifier who shows easier versions of the exercisers and a more advanced exerciser.

The set is a nice, well-lit room, with brick walls and wood flooring.  It's very easy to see the form of the Angie and the other two exercisers while you work out.  The music is generic electronica, but it's got a nice upbeat tone to it.

The choreography is also very basic, so if you're not someone who likes complex step choreography, you'll really appreciate the moves.  Angie also encourages you to do your own thing if you find that you can't keep up with her moves.

I really like Angie's personality, and she gives very good cues and form pointers.  As Angie mentions in the Introduction, she herself is a working mother, one who decided to create workout DVDs to reach out to the home exerciser.  She gives good form pointers and provides great cueing, so it's very easy to follow along with each workout.

As I mentioned at the start of my review, I really like Angie and this workout, and know that I'll be purchasing more of her DVDs in the future!",1382832000,2,3109,4.525089605734767
5924101,4,B00EK2P3VA,"First a little background: I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser and I normally workout 6 days a week.  I like to mix things up and have a ton of exercise dvds.  Some of my favorite workout dvds include:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cathe-Friedrich-s-Body-Blast-Kick-Punch-Crunch-and-Legs-Glutes-DVD/dp/B0007ZA5EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cathe Friedrich's Body Blast: Kick, Punch & Crunch and Legs & Glutes DVD</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Minutes-To-Fitness-Weights-Workout-with-Kelly-Coffey-Meyer/dp/B00170C15O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Minutes To Fitness: Weights Workout with Kelly Coffey-Meyer</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ACE-HIIT-Series-with-Chris-Freytag/dp/B00B1W0BQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ACE HIIT Series with Chris Freytag</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YogaWorks-for-Everybody-Body-Slim/dp/B002P8LKBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YogaWorks for Everybody: Body Slim</a>.

I like working out but prefer shorter intense workouts.  For that reason, I choose to do the shorter premixes on Ultimate Sweat and Tone.  I only have a high step so I did all work on the floor making sure to squat low and always touch the floor to keep up the intensity.  This is definitely a tough workout!  I normally use 12-15lbs (and sometimes more) for my weight workouts so I was both shocked and humbled that 3-5lbs gave me such a workout!  This is definitely a low weight high rep and you will feel it!  While I didn't have major DOMS all over which actually surprised me given how much I was feeling it during the workout, my calves were sore for 5 days after completing the 2nd short premix!

This is my first time working out with Angie and she is definitely a likeable instructor.  I thought that her cueing was good for the most part but more advance notice before changing moves would be nice.  However, this is really only an issue until you get the moves down (which are very straight forward) so I doubt that this will be noticeable after doing the workout 4+ times.

There are two background exercisers and I liked that Angie included a non-step background exerciser.  I also liked that the non-step background exerciser mainly modified in terms of equipment but not intensity.  This may be a problem for some but I wanted the same intensity as Angie, I just don't own a step.  For those wanting actual modifications, Angie gives these throughout the workout so modifications are covered.
This is a good workout that is definitely very user oriented.  There are a ton of premixes of various lengths offering both split and total body workouts.  Also, the exercises are well chaptered so you can do any body part on any given day.  While I don't think I will use this dvd in my regular rotation (ONLY because I prefer higher weight and lower reps), I will definitely use it ever two weeks or so to keep my muscles guessing.  THIS IS DEFINITELY A VERY GOOD WORKOUT AND WELL WORTH THE MONEY!",1382745600,,3097,5.979591836734694
5924102,3,B00EK2P3VA,"I want to quantify my level of experience, I consider myself very advanced.  I own over 400 workout DVD's and have worked out to many professionals with varying styles, techniques and practices.

While good the choreography was too basic for my taste.  The pace of the workout did not match the beat of the music, and that proved to be distracting.  I think that this would prove to be a negative for beginners in particular.

The workout was definitely a challenge and physically demanding.  However I do believe that the warmup/cool down could have been a little longer, and the workout went full speed too fast.

I believe it is very important to select the right music to match the workout, particularly when the work out is challenging the music can prove to be that motivator that gets you over that hump.  It is also essential that the the warmup be sufficient enough to help mitigate injury, and the cool down for the same reason.

Angie showed some low impact modifications throughout the workout, her modifer resulted in the same level of impact as Angie and the other girl.

I believe that all of the elements are present for a solid routine that is engaging and motivating at the same time, Angie has a great demeanor and superb work ethic that can inspire, I just recommend that  Angie put a little more work into the routine in order to grab an audience and retain a following.

The equipment used is minimal (which is great): light and medium dumbbells, a step and a mat. I have tried her Custom 3 Fit 50/50 workout so I'll be drawing some comparisons with that workout, which I also enjoy. First with what I liked:

- This is a super challenging workout! As a low advanced exerciser, I was humbled by the fact that I couldn't get in all of the reps; my legs and triceps were especially fried!
- I really appreciated the minimal equipment used and that there was a no-step option. I think most home exercisers don't have a step and I am one who appreciates minimal equipment.
- There is a modifier.
- Angie is not a career fitness instructor; she has a desk job. In addition, she is a mom and has faced several injuries, so I find her very motivating (as opposed to someone who is paid to exercise all day).
- The production quality is greatly improved from her 50/50 workout.
- While the music was generic, it wasn't bad and it was a great improvement from her 50/50 workout - I felt like the music from that workout was frantic and stressful.
- I wasn't crazy about the 50 min premix, but I do greatly appreciate the fact that there are several premixes. After doing the whole 88 min workout I was exhausted and I doubt I'll have the time to do that again!
- I find it amazing how she manages to fry each muscle with puny 3-5 lb. weights in sets that are less than 5 minutes!
- This is one of the most advanced workouts I own - something to work up to!
- She is a very pleasant and motivating instructor without being annoying.

Now, what I didn't like:
- I was really bothered that this workout steered away from the ""Custom 3 Fit"" concept. While there was a modifier, I would have appreciated an ""intermediate"" level to each exercise. I really liked the 50/50 workout in that sense; you could choose which level to do for each exercise, which is great if you want to do the advanced version of some exercises or the intermediate or beginner level in others, depending on what you can do and what you're good at. Additionally, it gives you the option to ""customize"" the workout every time you do it, so you don't get bored. While having a modifier is great, sometimes I don't want to go all the way to the beginner level of some exercises if I'm not up to the advanced level.
- The step. Her 50/50 workout is very challenging at the advanced level without a step, and workouts can be VERY challenging with minimal equipment.
- This is minimal, but Angie is not the best at cueing. I'm not sure what move is coming next but this is not a huge issue after doing the workout a couple of times.
- The warm-up needed its own warm-up! There was high impact too early on.
- The crunches. I feel that plank-type exercises are way more effective for your core than crunches, but that's just my personal preference - I prefer workouts that include core work inadvertently, not as a separate section of crunches in the end. I do appreciate that she did include a challenging plank section beforehand though.

Overall, I did like this workout and hope that Angie releases more in the future! Angie is a great instructor and very inspiring! Keep them coming, Angie!",1382400000,,3338,4.354735152487962
5924104,5,B00EK2P3VA,"A little background, I have been a home exerciser for over 30 years and have tried just about every fitness DVD out there.  I consider myself to be advanced.  Angie's Ultimate Sweat and Tone rates right up there with the best.  Lots of options to choose from whether you want a long workout or just choose a few segments to do, it's chaptered so nicely that it's easily doable.  Love all the premix options, you get short and long premixes.  So much variety in this DVD.  I love the form pointers through out the workout, even though I'm advanced I still need to be reminded.  There is a modifier but my only complaint is that I wish she modified all the moves, not just modifying if you don't have a step at home.  Angie will show beginner modifications through out which is nice but I know some people like to have a modifier to follow along with through out the entire workout.  The Lower Body Calorie Torcher, one of the longer premix options, is awesome!  I even had to take a few breathers during the workout!!  I like that you can go as light or as heavy as you want with the weights and you are going to get a great calorie burning workout.  Angie has a great personality and I think she will go far in the fitness industry.  You'll do moves you've never done before and with all the options available on one DVD there is not time for boredom!!",1382227200,,1352,4.317460317460317
5924105,4,B00EK2P3VA,"This DVD is great!  I consider myself an advanced excerciser, doing a DVD workout 5 to 6 times a week.  This is the first one I have tried by Angie, as I usually use The Firm, Cathe, Amy Bento, Michelle Dozois, etc.  This DVD of Angies is much harder than any Cathe I have ever done, and, she has a much happier delivery than I sometimes see with Cathe- who comes across too serious for me most of the time.  I would say this DVD is somewhat similar to a Jari Love one I like which supposedly burns 1000 calories.  Angie's delivery seems slightly harder, so the calorie burn may be higher per minute than even Jari Love.

Angie also does some moves that I have never seen before, which adds a bit of a suprise element to the DVD.  My legs were burning from her high reps, but like one reviewer also mentions, the clock at the bottom of the screen reminds you that you can get through even the toughest moves as the total time on each of them is relatively ""short"".

Another unique thing about this DVD, in addition to the moves, is the quality and quantity of pre-mix options.  I have not seen a DVD with as many options before.  It looks like there is a premix for just about any workout day, depending on what you want to focus on and how much time you have.

Great job Angie.  Keep the fun ones coming!",1382140800,,1305,4.196787148594377
5924106,4,B00EK2P3VA,"(For reference, I am an advanced exerciser.  I workout 6-7 days a week for 1-2 hrs a session running, lifting weights, doing hiit.  As far as dvds go I probably use Cathe the most but am also a fan of Tonique, Dream Body and many other advanced instructors.)

I did the Lower Body premix this morning.

The warm-up is VERY fast-paced. I need a warm-up BEFORE this warm-up! It starts out moving very fast. A few mins into the meat of my workout and I was up to speed with her. Next time I will skip the dvd warm-up (the menu has this option) and do my own warm-up.

I have to mention that I ran 4 miles before I did this workout. Not sure if that was a crazy idea or not! I was able to make it through the workout without missing any reps but there were some tough moments for sure.  The format alternated cardio with weight work focused on a single body part, sometimes just on one side and then cardio, and sometimes you go from one side to another. She really fries the muscle groups. My butt FELT IT. She does a lot of tempo changes--pulse, up two down two, do two exercises for 16 reps, then the same two exercises for 8 reps. It reminded me a lot of Jari Love in that way. Also she completely fries the body part as I said. Next time I would like to repeat the inner thigh section as well, would have liked to have seen that in this premix, as this section was also very good.

The cardio is a lot of impact and very basic athletic moves (also similar to Jari)--frog jumps, high knees, lateral jumps, toe taps on the bench etc. The modifier doesn't use a bench but Angie herself actually shows most of the modifications.

There is so much content on here. A bunch of premixes. The one I did was lower body which includes calves, and she works calves and biceps together. I didn't want to do upper body so I skipped that section as well as the included abs. This workout is very well-chaptered so skipping around was easy. There was one time during the premix where I had to pause bc she had stretched one side and it immediately skipped to cardio when you finished working the other side. I needed that stretch!!

The music is pretty horrid. It is like the same electronic kind of song the entire time. Most of the time I didn't notice due to the intensity of the workout and I don't much care about music anyway, but for those of you who do care...it is bad.

Angie herself is great. I have never done one of her workouts before. She was really likeable--very encouraging and upbeat without being annoying, she talked just the right amount. This workout is so simple cueing really isn't an issue. I really really liked what I did today. I can't wait to try more.

I would rate this as more of an int/adv workout. It is accessible to intermediates bc of all the premix options, but will definitely challenge your endurance.

Thumbs up from me.",1382140800,,2848,4.292910447761194
5924107,4,B00EK2P3VA,"I have a large collection of workout dvds and I found this DVD to be a great value.  It is over 85 minutes long and has 10 premixes, 5 short and 5 long.  It also is very well chaptered so you can choose individual muscle groups to work.  You can even choose no warmup which I like since you can add parts of this to another workout.  It is a high rep/low weight workout and is deceptively hard, which allows for growth.  I found the shoulder, tricep and floorwork chapters to be KILLER!  For the price it is a very good value.  I will get a lot of use from it.  Only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because in a couple of places Angie's timing seemed off the beat of the music, which was minor to me.  She seemed rushed at times but I had no problem following her.",1382054400,,769,4.006578947368421
5924108,5,B00EK2P3VA,"I have other workout videos by Angie Gorr that I really enjoy, so I was anxiously waiting for the release of this one.  What I love most is the flexibility it offers - there are several pre-mixes that range from 30 to 85 minutes of workout content.  This enables me to tailor my workout to the time I have available.  It also allows me to choose a weight training routine, cardio, or some of both.  The exercises suggest minimal equipment or no equipment at all, if desired. Angie offers modifications to her workouts enabling every fitness level to participate.  Her programs are easy to follow, but they provide a good challenging workout.  Angie brings motivation and excitement to her workouts.  She is very passionate, upbeat, and knowledgeable about exercise and health which is very apparent on the DVD.  So glad to own this DVD and can't wait for her next release!  Keep it going Angie!",1382054400,,894,4.716129032258064
5924109,5,B00EK2P3VA,"I loved this workout!  Normally, I prefer to do splits and work one or two body parts per session.  I also prefer to do my cardio separately from my weight workouts.  That being said, it's good to mix things up so you keep your body guessing and avoid plateaus.

This workout works every body part and includes cardio bursts to keep your heart rate elevated.  There are 10 pre-mixes, ranging in time from 30 minutes to 85 minutes.  You can work total body, just upper, just lower or mix in the cardio.  Since this is a high rep workout, you are working more on endurance than building muscle strength like you would with heavy weights.  There is something for everyone.

It is a big plus that minimal equipment is needed for this workout.  You'll need:

Light to moderate weights
Exercise mat
Step (optional for added intensity).

Why I enjoyed this workout:

* It's real.  Angie is not a fitness model, she is a working Mom who has faced many injuries. The background exercisers are also working women/Moms.  It's inspiring to watch them.

* The new twists on old moves.  I loved the pulsing bicep curls with the calf raises.  The abs section on pluses with a twist had a Pilates feel to it and really burned!

* Each section is 3-5 minutes long.  I tell myself I can do anything for that length of time.  There is a timer at the bottom of the screen so you know exactly how much time is left.

* There's room to grow with the workout.  I consider myself to be an advanced exerciser who has completed P90X, Cathe's STS, and Insanity.  I was humbled by this workout.  During the leg tap sequence, I was quick to do these on the floor, instead of on the step.  My leg muscles were screaming!  For the bicep and triceps exercises, I was using teeny tiny 3 pound weights and my muscles were talking to me.  I loved it!

* It can be hard or as easy as you want. I loved the fact that there were two modifiers.  They didn't distract from the workout; they just seemed a natural part of the session.  I especially liked them because I had to modify during several parts.  One modifier is working without a step and using heavier weights and the other modifier, who has a knee injury is using lighter weights and not going as deep in the lunges.

* The versatility.  If you want a quick workout, you can choose a shorter pre-mix; if you want to really work, you can choose a longer premix.  I also love that you have the option to skip the warm up if you're using this DVD as an add-on workout.

* The form pointers.  They came at just the right time.  Angie keeps telling us to hold in our core, but that's the one thing that I kept forgetting to do because I was breathing so hard.  It was wonderful to keep getting that reminder.  At one point, she even tells us to stop holding our breath.  Busted!

The music was rather blah.  I especially love it when a tough workout has music with a good beat because it helps me push harder.  I must admit that I was enjoying the workout so much, after a while I didn't even notice the music.  Some other reviewers have commented that the moves were off the beat of the music.  I honestly didn't notice that, probably because I was breathing so heavy.

If you are looking for a fun workout that works your total body, you will enjoy this workout.  It's so versatile; you will have no excuse not to fit in a workout, even on your busiest days.",1382054400,5,3377,4.311004784688995
5924110,3,B00EK2P3VA,"This DVD was not designed to do in a single day unless you have the lower body of a bionic man or woman.  Overall, the DVD offers some unique and effective moves. Since most of the large muscles are in the lower body, doing routines using the lower body will burn more calories and challenging these muscles differently will increase their strength.

However, Angie Gorr definitely should have done a better job with the warm-up and the music.
I really wanted to love this DVD but the warm-up sets the mood for me.
Not only were the moves too fast and music dull but the gal showing the no bench alternative started off on a different foot!

The music stayed dull and music is my key to enjoying a workout.
However, I will try many of the chapters with my own music.
Really lurved the Plies variations in Chapter 11!  They even worked well sitting on a stability ball.

Unlike Custom3Fit 50/50, Angie had everyone doing the moves in unison instead of doing different moves at different intensities.  Unfortunately, I personally preferred the many other demonstrated options in 50/50.",1381968000,,1083,4.703703703703703
5924111,3,B00EK2P3VA,"The production of this dvd was very good.  Nice setting, music was fair, uncomplicated choreography, and the premixes are great.  This is an advanced, high
impact workout.  Angie has two workout partners, one with a step bench and one
without.  Cueing is fair.  Sometimes the cardio moves are off the beat of the music.  Angie does give modifications for some of the high impact moves, but doesn't does so right at the beginning of the move.  The modifier without the step bench should have been doing all of the low impact moves but does not.  For the amount of high impact of this workout, I felt there should have been a longer warm up.  The cool down was just a short stretch segment.  The cool down should have been separate from the stretch.  The stretch segment should have been longer and more thorough.  I enjoyed the workout with the exception of the warmup/cool down segments.  I will substitute my own when I do this workout again.",1381968000,2,943,4.608433734939759
5924112,3,B00EK2P3VA,"Angie is likeable and this workout is advanced and LONG but there are 10 premixes which allow you to make it as short as 30 minutes. Here are the problems:  Angie doesn't seem to have basic instructor techniques down and this video shows that.  She is sloppy in counting and cueing, she doesn't mirror and can't seem to follow the beat of the music.  In this respect, I had a really hard time following her.  She would say something like, ""4 more to go"" and then quit the exercise after just 2 reps.  She does this often.  The warm up was high impact.  I have never seen this in a warm up - she starts jumping immediately - frog jumps!!! I just stared at the tv in amazement. All of her cardio though is high impact but she does show low impact options. Good workout though - I was dripping with sweat.",1381881600,,802,4.2368421052631575
5924113,5,B00EK2P3VA,"This DVD is so versatile - you can easily modify up or down to make the workout as hard or easy as you want, and there are 10 premixes so you can pick how long you want the workout to be.  Angie is very likeable, her cuing is great, and she gives form pointers and modification tips (easier and harder) throughout the entire workout. The workout was fun and tough, perfect for an advanced-intermediate (but it's as hard or easy as you want it to be).",1381881600,,450,4.232558139534884
5924114,5,B00EK2P3VA,"I have tried Angie's previous videos and always had a great workout from them but this one really shows the potential of the workouts and much improved production quality.  I really enjoy that you can customize the workout to easily choose what you want to work on or focus on that day and that it is not just the same workout each time.

I tend to do cardio on my own but then use her different weight workouts to get an great workout using only light dumbbells and body weight.  She uses many ideas I have seen in other videos and workouts but mixes them all effortlessly so it does not get boring.  I think this is a good at home option for people who get bored lifting weights at the gym.

Looking forward to more videos from her and this is a nice addition to any home video workout collection.",1381881600,2,799,4.264900662251655

- excellent premixes make it a great value
- creative and effective exercises for every single area of the body
- segment lengths are just long enough to make you feel worked, but so long that you get bored
- Angie has a pleasant demeanor and gives helpful form pointers and instruction along the way
- good pacing
- no crunches in the abs/core section

Cons:
- I would have liked more cardio -- there are only 3x5-min segments of cardio, and they are not that tough
- music/rhythm is lacking, so it's hard to get into a groove
- unless you have time to do the entire DVD, which is highly unlikely since it's 85 mins), it's not what I would call ""advanced"" (this could be a problem for intensity junkies)",1404950400,,710,4.338345864661654

I appreciate the fact that the girls in this video don't look like super models and get a good workout from this along side the rest of us. I was amazed at how much work this is! A lot of repetitions, nothing fancy just a good work out that focus's on the legs, arms and the rest of you!
I would highly recommend this video, i would prefer something a little shorter this run about 35-40 minutes but none the less, this will leave you feeling like you worked out hard and earned every minute of it.",1403049600,,714,4.035211267605634

I do the long version and find that the time flies by and before I know it, I've completed the workout and I'm a sweaty mess. I felt that I get a very good cardio workout, the jumping up and down on the step is tough but I love how Angie uses a timer on the screen so you can see how much time is left and for me this seems to make a tough exercise more doable being able to count down the time. I'm am advanced exerciser but I think this dvd could easily work for a beginner because Angie demonstrates different ability levels and a beginner could start with a shorter pre mix. I look forward to trying Angie's other workouts. Highly recommended.",1390003200,,789,4.12987012987013
