2422945,2,B000BKSIS0,"I can't think of any reason, other than specialized scholarship, why anyone would ever watch the unrestored version of Metropolis, ever.  The restored version (with the original soundtrack) is superior in every way to the butchered cut that circulated for decades after the film was originally released.

And you do want to see Metropolis and Things to Come.  They are both brilliant works of great artistic and historical value.

Even if you are dirt poor, borrow superior copies from your local library rather than buy this disk.  The only person I can think of who ought to buy this disk is an elementary or high school history teacher who wants to have a copy of Things to Come on hand, so students can better understand what people feared and hoped for in the years leading up to the Second World War.",1340755200,7,806,4.6879432624113475
2422946,3,B000BKSIS0,"I want to purchase the `Things To Come' DVD.  Amazon offers 4 versions (Colorized, Rental, 2/27/2001 version, and Metropolis / Things To Come). The reviews for these items are all over the place and in some cases repeated, verbatim, for different versions.  I am confused = which version is of the best quality????",1316476800,3,314,4.90566037735849
2422947,1,B000BKSIS0,"The 1 star is solely for the abysmal quality of the prints and disk.  The films are true cinema classics that deserve much better treatment.

You know you're in for a rough ride when the distributor appologizes and makes excuses for the prints before the films begin!  The prints for both of these are very poor quality with video that ""breaths"" and ""pulses"".  Contrast is so poor that several scenes are nothing but a black screen.  Making out objects in dark scenes is virtually impossible.  All the title cards are ""stills"" that have been reinserted into the prints.  They are the best looking parts!

BOTH copies (original and replacement) I received were unplayable on several players.  Both went back.  I did not bother getting a replacement on the 2nd bad one as I had seen enough from both copies to decide it is better to pay more and get one of the remastered versions that are available.

If all you are wanting to do is screen the films (my original goal) to determine if you want to pay for better copies this might be acceptable.  Even then, both films are available in other multi-film packages that offer better value although I'm sure the audio/video quality will be about the same.",1198627200,21,1199,4.6571428571428575

8088080,5,B000BKSIS0,Two great movies for the price of one.  The original silent motion picture classic Metropolis and an early sci-fi classic from an H. G. Wells book.  Both are treasures to me and enhance my personal collection of such masterpieces.,1415836800,,230,4.871794871794871
8088081,2,B000BKSIS0,"This is a cheap DVD re-packaging of an equally cheap VHS release which I bought almost 30 years ago. It was the first--and by far the worst--version of 'Metropolis' I ever saw. This is a highly truncated version of the film, just over half the running time of the original, and transferred from a totally roached out print. And much of it is so washed out it is simply unwatchable and the ragtime piano score is so absurd it's downright annoying. I found it more watchable with the volume turned down and Vivaldi's 'The Four Seasons' on the stereo. Even in this wretched presentation, the visual majesty of Fritz Lang's masterpiece is undeniable. As an alternative, I would recommend either of the Kino Video releases--the 2011 restoration, which incorporates footage from a newly discovered print of Fritz Lang's original edit along with a new recording of the original piano score or Giorgio Moroder's 1984 reconstruction that includes a contemporary pop music soundtrack and subtle washes of color to turn this 1926 film into an MTV-era rock opera. Both of these versions return the film to a semblance of the original's visual majesty, albeit in very different ways.

The second feature, 'Things to Come' is a classic in its own right and makes a nice pairing with 'Metropolis', but the version in this package was obviously transferred from a badly worn print. There's bound to be a better quality transfer out there.

Yes, this disc is a cheap 'two-fer' but unfortunately, you get exactly what you pay for. I highly recommend holding out for better copies of both films. Trust me, the difference will be worth it.",1411084800,3,1619,4.86231884057971
8088082,5,B000BKSIS0,"Sorry,... I can't pass this one up. my vhs tapes are getting worn and when I came across this I had to buy it.
I enjoy old silent films as well as old sci-fi movies. If your into nastalgia you'll love this one. The package has one silent and one talkie. You couldn't beat that with a hot dog. So grab your popcorn and soda pop and enjoy the show Folks!
Enjoy
All the best
