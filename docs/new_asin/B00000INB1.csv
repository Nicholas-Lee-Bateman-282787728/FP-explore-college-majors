1224021,5,B00000INB1,"I have used several different step videos, as well as floor aerobics videos, and this one is the best!  Her moves are fun, fresh, and vigorous.  I get an excellent workout every time--and have used the video off and on for years.  I find the video more challenging than most live classes.  Following the step aerobics, this video offers a section of weighted arms and an excellent ab work at the end.
If you like step aerobics, this is the video for you!",1028505600,2,454,4.433734939759036
1224022,5,B00000INB1,"This is my favorite tape. I've just moved out of the US and can't get my regular step and weight workouts at the gym. After trying lots of other video tape instructors, I've found Karen to be the best. She gives you a hard workout without all the annoying whoops and ""looks hot!"" commentary. You can do the first part of the tape for a great high intensity workout, or skip to the end when you have less time for the weights and abs. This tape is well worth every penny. Have fun!",995414400,5,480,4.172043010752688
1224023,2,B00000INB1,"I bought this video because almost every reviewer gave it 5 stars and said it was a good workout and not too complicated.  Some did say it was not for beginners, and that is definitely true.  But I am not a beginner, and it is VERY complicated.  The moves for the feet are complicated enough and when I felt I almost had the move down arms were added and before I could get that down a whole new routine would be started so quickly, and again over before I could get it down.  Even the stretches were done very quickly.  It was so frustrating and I felt that although I just bought it and only did it once, I find it unlikely I will pick it up again.",989539200,5,650,4.046875
1224024,5,B00000INB1,"I don't do all of the power moves, and I only use a six-inch step--but let me tell you, I've NEVER done an aerobic routine that works me out so thoroughly. When I make it through that last ""sprint"" on the floor, I feel like I can conquer the world. Between the enjoyable choreography (especially the fourth sprint, where you glide over the top and it feels like you're airborn!) and the topnotch jazz-flavored soundtrack, I get so caught up in this that not only do I finish it feeling pleasantly bushed, but whatever stress I had at the end of the day is l-o-n-g gone. The next day, I swagger into my office feeling like I could handle a whole room full of university administrators:) This is a great cross-training tape. Walkers, runners and marathoners could use it to increase their endurance and/or improve their speed, as some of my friends have done. Karen is also very thorough in her toning, though, to be honest, I don't care for that part of the workout. (The FIRM has spoiled me, I'm afraid!) Folks who don't care for FIRM-type strength training could give this a try--lighter weights and more reps might be just the ticket.
This one is definitely NOT for beginners. I was one not so long ago, and this would have probably put me in traction had I tried to do it in the early months of my fitness program:) However, high intermediates and low advanced folks should find enough modifications included in the workout to make it accessible as they build up their strength and endurance.
When this first came out, it was $20.00 retail and worth every penny.  It's a steal now at half the price, and I promise you the music is as fresh and fun as it was ten years ago.  So is the routine.  Karen has never put out a better tape, and as interval training goes, this one is still nearly unrivalled by any other.
Grade: A+++ and 10 extra points",987033600,7,1848,4.461538461538462
1224025,5,B00000INB1,"Energy Sprint is an advanced workout for those starting to exercise and an invigorating challenge for those who have already achieved a high level of fitness. Spending 80 minutes on exercise requires determination, stamina and dedication!

You can either use a step/bench or work your way up to using it. The step Karen sells is great as you can use it at different height levels to increase the intensity of the exercises. This workout is a bit different than normal step workouts. You will notice a ""Sprint Timer"" which will appear when the intensity level goes up. The timer helps to keep you going right to the last second even though the exercises are very challenging at that point.

Energy Sprint is based on ""Interval Training."" You will alternate between high and low levels of intensity. Karen is known for her innovative workout programs and this in a good example of how she uses full range of motion, control of movement and repetitions which ensure you will change your shape and reach your goals.

Karen owns the Voight Fitness and Dance Center in Los Angeles, CA where she keeps her clients in top shape. She excels in clarity of instruction and creative style of motion. She incorporates some of her classic ""Karen Moves"" into this video and also focuses on many unique step moves you won't see anywhere else.

Have your step all ready to go when you put in this video. Karen jumps right into the first 40 minute aerobic section, keeps you moving through 15 minutes of butt and leg exercises, helps you shape your arms and upper body for 15 minutes and then spends 12 minutes showing you how to get those abs in shape.

There is a heart rate check during this workout, but you will want to monitor your heart rate during the aerobics section as some of the exercises are pretty intense. Don't let that stop you from ordering this video. While it is the hardest video I have ever done in my life, I feel incredibly good after I get through it. I can tell a difference in my circulation, my body is warm for hours and I feel very alert and ready to face life's next challenge. If you are serious about fitness, this is the workout you will want add to your workout video collection.

1224026,5,B00000INB1,I am an advanced exerciser and sometimes it's hard to find videos with long/hard enough aerobic segments.  I found this video to be a complete workout - hitting all areas and aerobically challenging enough also!!,974851200,5,212,5.057142857142857
1224027,5,B00000INB1,"This is the first exercise video I have purchased and love it! I used to workout at Karen's West Hollywood studio back in '92-'93 and feel like I am back inside her studio listening to her easy to follow instructions.  In the video she also ""begins with learning the feet first"" then adds the arms so we can follow along without getting too frustrated.  If you really want a challenging, safe workout then buy this video.  She has simple foot work on the step-box (you don't have to have a step, I started the first few weeks without a step) so you don't feel like you will fall off the step.  The cardio is terrific, however the arms could have be alittle more challenging -Have a great workout.",971654400,4,696,4.4140625
1224028,5,B00000INB1,"This was the third Karen Voight video I purchased, and when I put it in the VCR just to view it, I thought it looked easy. The next morning when I actually used it, however, I was amazed at how challenging it is. I love it  and have noticed that I'm losing weight faster since I started using it.  Don't worry if you don't get all the moves at first, you'll pick it up  shortly and while you're learning it, believe me, you'll sweat! And you'll  feel good all day as she really gets your energy level up.",958780800,8,504,4.112244897959184

1224030,5,B00000INB1,I've tried this video and loved the results.  Karen's instructions are excellent. She encourages you to work at your own level and gradually build  from there.  I've lost this video and am searching high and low for  another copy.  If you want a total body toning which includes upper and  lower body along w/step aerobics this is perfect.  Certainly not boring.  Enjoy!!!,916963200,,372,4.887096774193548
7910876,4,B00000INB1,This is a challenging workout. I'm a longtime Karen Voight fan. The first product I received wouldn't play. I received a replacement promptly. That made me happy because I'd looked forward to owning this recording.,1516492800,,214,5.142857142857143

7910878,5,B00000INB1,"When I purchased this tape I anticipated a typical, run-of-the-mill workout.  I was unexpectedly, but pleasantly, surprised at this tremendously energetic, varied, and stimulating workout.  Karen uses an on-screen sprint meter to mark the progression of the sprint sessions.  Each sprint is a bit longer than the former one, and she shows various ways of doing the entire workout (sprints included) in a less strenuous manner.  By using the many ways of modifying the routines, this advanced tape can be useful for exercisers of all fitness levels.

Karen's cuing is superb, her moves are graceful, and her choreography is simple yet varied.  Video and DVD exercise is my primary form of structured activity, and I have been doing it for 15 years.  This tape has just moved to the #1 place in my large collection of VHS and DVD workouts!",1105056000,5,837,4.935714285714286
7910879,5,B00000INB1,"I really enjoyed this step workout.  The first part on the step consists of many lunges.  It will make you sweat... I didn't find that it was too difficult to follow.  When you turn the step sideways, I thought the workout got a lot more difficult.  Thankfully, it didn't last too long. Still an excellent workout.
Following all the stepping, you will need hand weights to do the upper body section.  I didn't think this section was hard at all.. which was OK for me because I don't really need to tone my arms.
Finally, the ab section.  Pretty good ab section.  You will feel it.  Overall, a fine workout.",1087603200,3,606,4.445454545454545
7910880,4,B00000INB1,"I like Karen Voight and found this to be a good and challenging video.  Tough aerobically, but not difficult with fancy dance steps, etc.  But, this is long.  Probably too long to use consistantly.  I know I use videos when I don't have a lot of extra time.
Plan on 90 minutes to go through this entire workout.",1082332800,4,311,4.310344827586207
7910881,5,B00000INB1,"I just got through doing this video for the first time about an hour ago and I am REALLY feeling the endorphins kick in~! It's a no nonsense Interval Training mostly cardio workout using the step with some body sculpting moves-in the beginning you do pre-exhaust on the legs, after the cardio you do legs and abs. As a home exerciser who generally takes her cardio out of doors via the bike and jogging (sometimes I'll do a cardio video if I can find one I like-The Firm's Cardio Burn affectionately comes to mind :) ) and as one who will only resort to machines in the most desperate of times, I am *really* excited about this video-It's definitely a keeper for indoor sessions!!! I found the steps to be a little difficult but *definitely* doable~any step workout you can automatically master is, to me, a waste because you'll just be really bored after a few times,and when the moves are a lil more dynamic you also increase your coordination. And the routines were FUN!  I also *really* liked that this video was 80 minutes. True, the last 20 were not aerobic, but I really feel I got a good 45-60 (?not sure?) aerobic session in. I wasn't bored at ALL through the video, something that I have mainly only found in The Firm Videos and Karen Voight to date. Also, as someone who loves loves loves (the original Benson) Firms, I found this a very refreshing change with different moves. The body sculpting was easy for me, maybe next time I'll go heavier, but I liked the differentness of it. Karen calls the higher intensity, cardio segments ""sprints"" and she understands what makes an 80 minute video seem like 30 minutes~variety and mental involvement (the more complex steps play a part in this as well). I am so blissful after doing this workout! What more could an exerciser ask for???",1058832000,6,1793,4.585669781931464
7910882,5,B00000INB1,"If you are looking for a challenge, this is it. She takes you through so many leg squats and lunges that your thighs tremble. 2 hours later, you are still jittery. Its awesome. I have never gotten such a intense leg workout. And us women need that. I always rate the workouts by the soreness the next day. I usually get sore from this one. I try to do it 2 times a week. Even once a week will super charge your metabolism into high gear.",1041206400,7,437,4.093023255813954
7910883,5,B00000INB1,"I usually run from 3-5 miles a day, but due to the cold icy New England winter, I didn't want to run outside anymore.  After going through some of my roommate's tapes and finding them too difficult, I settled on Karen's tapes, since her Pilates tape was easy to follow.  This tape was exactly what I was looking for - not a lot of confusing, complicated moves, but something to get my heart rate going. I have not yet done the strength training half of the video, but the aerobic part is definately wonderful.  Also, there are many different body types in the ""class"" with Karen, which is encouraging.  For those who wouldn't be caught dead in an aerobics or step class, this is the tape for you. This video does require a step, and the aerobic part runs about 60 minutes (despite the 40 minute claim)",1039132800,11,801,4.428571428571429
7910884,5,B00000INB1,"This workout kicks my butt everytime. It is pretty intense and very thorough. The step sections are interesting and varied, athletic and not dancy. There is a good leg strengthening section, and ab section, an upper body section and a nice cool down. This is a looong, tough workout so it is one for your hard workout days.
I really like Karen Voight. She is alogether professional and straightforward. No, she doesn't joke or whoop it up, but she tells you to keep going in a no nonsense way, and pays particular attention to making sure you are getting a thorough workout. This workout is not about having fun, but about working hard to get results. If you like dancy moves and lighthearted chatter this video will disappoint you.
The people working out with Karen have a variety of body types, which is nice to see. I especially like watching the one woman who is on the large side like me because that motivates me to keep going. I watch her, and mentally tell her ""I'm with you, sister--if you can keep going so can I!""",1031961600,13,1024,4.510752688172043
