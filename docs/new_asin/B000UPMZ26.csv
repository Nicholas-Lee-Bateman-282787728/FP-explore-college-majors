2923748,4,B000UPMZ26,"I was finally able to get a listing of the 10 games.  They are:

1. May 25, 1991:  Penguins vs. North Stars: Penguins claim their first Stanley Cup.

2. June 1, 1992:  Penguins vs. Blackhawks: Penguins clinch back-to-back Cups sweeping the series in four games.

3. April 25, 1989:  Penguins vs. Flyers: Mario Lemieux explodes for five goals and eight points in an epic playoff battle - Pittsburgh's first playoff berth since Lemieux's arrival.

4. Dec. 27, 2000:  Penguins vs. Maple Leafs: Mario Lemieux emerges from retirement in dramatic fashion with a goal and two assists.

5. April 24, 1996:  Penguins vs. Capitals: The Penguins and Capitals take four overtimes to decide Game Four of the '96 Eastern Conference quarterfinals as the Pens come out on top, 3-2.

6. April 9, 1993:  Penguins vs. Rangers: Penguins set NHL record with 16th consecutive win - Lemieux erupts for five goals.

7. Oct. 24, 2006:  Penguins vs. Devils: The 18-, 19- and 20-year-old trio of Jordan Staal, Sidney Crosby, and Evgeni Malkin all score a goal; Malkin's being a highlight for the ages, in a 4-2 win over Martin Brodeur and the Devils.

8. May 10, 2001:  Penguins vs. Sabres: Darius Kasparaitis joins the rush and scores the OT winner in Game Seven of the Eastern Conference semifinals.

9. Dec. 13, 2006:  Penguins vs. Flyers: Sidney Crosby has a six-point night to take over the NHL scoring lead in only his sophomore season.

10. April 13, 1991:  Penguins vs. Devils: Frank Pietrangelo makes what is simply known as `The Save' in a 4-3 win in Game Six of the Patrick Division semifinals.

As I do not know the quality of the film since I haven't seen them yet (releases in November), my rating is based off the games included.  I docked the set 1 star, as I am very, very disappointed that no pre-Lemieux games were included in the fans voting.",1192752000,38,1835,4.683385579937304
2923749,3,B000UPMZ26,"As others have mentioned, some of the game selections are rather poor. They seem to have chosen games where the Pens scored a lot of points, not necesarily games that were very intense. I also own the Edmonton Oilers 10 greatest games, and the selection of games were MUCH better - they have some from every era (Wayne, post Wayne, and recent from their last cup run). They had only 1 blowout, and that was a stanely cup winning game, so I can forgive it. Most the games were close, very exciting, and very intense.

A couple of the Pittsburgh games have been that, but mostly it seems to be a collection of high-scoring games, where Mario gets 5-8 points, and the Pens steamroll someone. That kind of thing is fine for 1 or 2 of the games, but when it seems to be half of them or more, it gets old, especially when the Pens have so many great games to choose from.",1239580800,,865,4.274390243902439
2923750,4,B000UPMZ26,"The quotation above is just one of Penguins play-by-play man Mike Lange's bizarre declarations after a Penguins goal.  Also, Lange gives a brief introduction before the games.  Not being a Penguin fan, I'm not going to get into nitpicking about which games should be on here.  Instead, I'll just discuss what is on here.

Most of the games on here feature fine video and audio quality.  Exceptions being the North Stars game (poor video and audio) and the '91 Devils game which was joined in progress in the first period due to what were called ""technical issues"".  In regards to the North Stars game, I've seen the CBC telecast of that game which looks and sounds fine.  Why not just use that one?  I'm all for having a local flavor, but not at the expense of the product.  That said, it's still a recommended purchase for Penguins and NHL fans.",1203206400,2,846,4.586666666666667
2923751,5,B000UPMZ26,"Get in the fast lane grandma.  The Bingo game is ready to roll!!!!
Before this new breed of Penguins starts making history of their own you need to grab this DVD collection and remember when the Stanley Cup was still just a gleam in our eyes.  Some of the most brilliant goals of Mario Lemieux's career are in this collection and they are just as amazing the second time around.  If you are like me you had many of these games on VHS and were starting to worry that time was about to erase those memories for good.  Now you can keep them fresh for the next generation and beyond.  Hurry, before we go dancing with Lord Stanley again!!!",1202860800,,635,4.302521008403361
2923752,4,B000UPMZ26,"Mario Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, and Sidney Crosby are without question three of the greatest superstars of their era. Therefore it was essential that at least one or two of the Crosby games were included here, even though none of Crosby's Penguin teams have yet won a championship. What is sacrificed are some of the games that date back to before the Lemieux era began, and there were quite a few memorable ones. But in the 1970's the Penguins were overshadowed by the Steelers and the Pirates, both Pittsburgh teams that won a half-dozen World Championships between them in the 1970's. That is why it would have been nice to include at least one game that showcased the franchise's rich history that began well before Super Mario arrived on the scene in 1984. Between Lemieux and Jagr alone, they served up so many memorable moments on the ice, this despite Lemieux's career being entirely plagued with injuries and misfortune, Penguin fans look to the future with Crosby and Evgeni Malkin as the next great hockey duo to rock the 'Burgh for the next decade-plus.",1197763200,7,1062,4.808743169398907
2923753,3,B000UPMZ26,"I'm a huge Pens' fan so I had to buy this DVD immediately.  It's pretty good and definitely brings back many great memories.  The video quality of the games is great, no glitches.  The games are shown in their original broadcast which include Penguins play by play announcer Mike Lange with Paul Steigerwald adding color commentary.  The four overtime playoff game against the Washington Capitals in 1996 is an ESPN telecast with Steve Levy providing play by play.  The 2001 Eastern Conference Semifinal game 7 win against the Buffalo Sabres is also an ESPN telecast with Gary Thorne and Bill Clement on the call.  Two of the included games are from the 2006 season which I don't agree with.  Both are regular season games versus the Philadelphia Flyers and New Jersey Devils.  There were so many great games during the 1980's and 1990's that the producers could have chosen instead, or at least given the fans a chance to vote on.  But the biggest dissapointment is the fact that THE GREATEST Penguins game ever is not included in the DVD set.  That would be game 1 of the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals at home against the Chicago Blackhawks.  If you ever get a chance to see game highlights on ESPN Classic or the NHL Network, don't miss it.  The Penguins trailed in this game 3-0 and 4-1 and for many Pens' fans a funny thing happened on the way to the refrigerator... Rick Tocchet scored to make it 4-2; Mario Lemieux made it 4-3 scoring a goal from an impossible angle behind the goal line.  He banked a shot of goaltender Ed Belfour's right leg.  With under 5:00 minutes remaining in regulation, Jaromir Jagr scored a goal that Lemieux called in his post-game press conference the greatest he'd ever seen.  Game tied 4-4.  The Pens lined up for a face off in the Chicago end with 17.2 seconds remaining.  Ron Francis won the face off, Larry Murphy took the shot, the rebound came off Belfour right to Lemieux who buried it.  Pens won 5-4.  No Pens' fan will ever forget this game nor Mike Lange's call of the winning goal.  You could say that this comeback win won the Penguins their second Stanley Cup.  Chicago never recovered and went on to get swept in the series 4 games to 0.  Hopefully there will be a Volume II that includes this game.

If you're a Penguins fan or a hockey fan in general, this DVD is definitely a good purchase.  I give it 3 out of 5 stars because the producers should have done a better job picking what games to include.  In my opinion, the two games from the 2006 season shouldn't in the list.",1197676800,28,2522,4.49010989010989
2923754,2,B000UPMZ26,"I was looking forward to buying this, but must say how disapointed I am in the game selection. There are only 3 games on there worthy of consideration, with several obvious poor choices. The 4 overtime game againts the capitals? who wants to sit through that? Your kidding me, right? Marios comeback from retirement? Surely there are better choices. The Francis goal against the rangers that saved the series and game 1 from the 92 finals are clearly much more exciting games than either of those. Anyway, I won't be buying this now and can only wonder what the producers were thinking?",1197504000,3,586,4.754901960784314
2923755,3,B000UPMZ26,"I'm guessing, maybe HOPING, that there aren't many pre 80's games available in their entirety.  They 5 goal 5 ways, Mario's first game ever, clinching the Rangers series without Mario and Joey, even the series loser against the Isles dynasty should have been included.  Perhaps th Primeau game as well?  Here's hoping for volume II.",1196380800,4,332,5.0
2923756,4,B000UPMZ26,I would like to say I have most of these games on DVD. I always recorded their playoff games every year. I bought the Philly playoff game where Mario scores 5g and 2a. The one I wanted the most isn't on here. It's when Mario scores in every possible way during a N.J. game. I don't understand why no history of the team as a whole like the NFL discs I have. This doesn't cover the whole history before Mario. Not a complete edition but a must if you don't have. Check out the Steelers history Dvd if your a fan of them. I own it but not a fan.,1195862400,5,543,3.9454545454545453
2923757,4,B000UPMZ26,"I have really enjoyed watching the games on the set.  10 greatest games?  Not really.  It's a shame there aren't any games from the pre-Lemieux Pens, and I really wish Game 1 from the 1992 Stanley Cup finals was included with the Pens comeback from 0-3 and 1-4, Mario's bank shot off Belfour's leg, Jagr's fantastic goal, and Mario's game-winner with seconds left.  I don't think that was even an option on the online poll to determine the games.  I'd also love to see more of the Jagr-led Pens, no matter how out of favor he is now with some Pens fans.  10 games just isn't enough-the only solution is more DVDs of great Pens games!",1195603200,2,633,4.413793103448276
2923758,1,B000UPMZ26,"The Pittsburgh Penguins history began in 1967 when they first joined the NHL. The first game in this 10-dvd series begins in 1989. The Penguins have a great history in Steeltown, and the first 22 years of this eventful franchise should not be wiped-out. Players such as Les Binkley, Syl Apps Jnr., Dave Burrows, Battleship Kelly, Randy Carlyle, Rick Kehoe, Paul Gardner, and many more. They even had a live 'Penguin Mascot' in their first NHL season for home games. They later played against the USSR as part of the NHL Super Series, and many more great events, and playoff games.
  Don't be fooled by this collection. The marketing manager is probably under 30 years of age. Perhaps Volume 2 will deal with the first 22 seasons of the Pittsburgh Penguins from 1967 through 1989, and offer fans the rich history of this storied NHL Hockey franchise.",1195430400,4,849,4.7687074829931975
8214300,5,B000UPMZ26,Awesome trip down memory lane! Only complaint is that it should a 20 DVD set cause the PENGUINS RULE!!!,1525824000,,103,4.473684210526316
8214301,4,B000UPMZ26,"Great set of some classic Pens games, wish there were more, love to watch and listen to these old games, so many other great games from the past that aren't on here - but still some good ones. Quality is about as good as you can get with games from this era, not your modern HD games but still fun to watch. hopefully they release more sets like these - why not? Or at least on itunes or something.",1480464000,,398,4.050632911392405

8214303,5,B000UPMZ26,"Great to hear Mike Lange calling these games, and great performances by the Penguins of the early '90's, and then in the Sidney Crosby era. Haven't watched all ten games yet, but very well done, especially the two Stanley Cup winning games against Minnesota, and Chicago.",1372982400,,271,4.913043478260869

8214305,5,B000UPMZ26,My husband loves these DVDs because it allows him to watch the Penguin's greatest moments in history. This made a great gift.,1354665600,,125,4.7272727272727275
8214306,5,B000UPMZ26,This is a great collection of the ten best games played by the Pittsburgh Penguins. Lots of action and excitement. Excellent packaging.,1325462400,,135,5.181818181818182
8214307,4,B000UPMZ26,"These are some great hockey games.  Is this set perfect?  No.

People will complain about their personal favorites not making the list, but this is a nice overview of the greatest (and memorable) moments in Penguins' recent history.

I love this set and I'm glad I bought it.",1266451200,,275,4.666666666666667
8214308,5,B000UPMZ26,"great dvd, a must own for a true pens fan, learn all the history and the picture quality is amazing on my lcd tv even though its old games",1257292800,,138,3.793103448275862
8214309,4,B000UPMZ26,"First of all I would like to say as a Penguins fan it's always nice to have games with super stars like Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr on hand to watch when you feel like it. It's great to be able to have old great matches on DVD (my VHS recordings of vintage games have been ruin by fungus).

10 Greatest Penguins games? Well, I don't know about that because I can recall matches in the past that I would of like to see on this DVD set... for example, the 1992 playoffs against the Bruins where Mario had 2 awesome goals, and Jagr did this back-handed goal by extending both arms to the opposite side of the net (if I remembered correctly).

Well anyway, it's still a good DVD set to have. One set of DVDs where you can watch legends like Lemieux and Jagr... and upcoming greats like Crosby and Malkin.

Maybe I'm just asking for too much...",1254700800,,842,4.25
