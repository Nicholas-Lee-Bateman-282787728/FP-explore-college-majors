8325800,5,B000V99FIS,"This was a very interesting movie.  The DVD also included a 1969 documentary about the life of Squizzy Taylor.  He was an Australian gangster from the 1920's.  While only 5'2"" tall his was a man to be feared.  This covers his life from his rise from petty thief to connected gangster to his death.  The DVD is region 2 and will not play on most US DVD players.",1509667200,,360,4.235294117647059
8325801,5,B000V99FIS,"Biopic of the most influencial and legendary gangster in australian history Squizzy Taylor a fun loving mischevious little fellow who rose to prominance as the most successfull career criminal in australian history and became embroiled in the legendary Fitzroy Vendetta gang war. although the film dosent really explore his rise to power nor the sheer level of control he had (at his height he was compareable to al capone in america or the kray twins in england) it does give you a verry good feel for the australian underworld at the time and its almost indenticle to the underworld presented in the classic american prohibition era gangster movies. a real lost and forgotten gem which i beleive was also australias first gangster film.

a real must see.",1291507200,,756,4.952755905511811
