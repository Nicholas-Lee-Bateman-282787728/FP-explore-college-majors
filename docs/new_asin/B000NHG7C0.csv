If you like the original series, you will love this one!",1224806400,,273,11.454545454545455
2768715,5,B000NHG7C0,"What can I say?  I have loved Scooby Doo since I was a little boy waking up early on Saturday mornings to watch it.  I felt like I was actually solving a mystery back then, they always went to amazing places I wanted to go to, they were scary, but not really, and the gang had a certain synergy that work really well even for a 5-10 year old.

I've seen some movies and other version of them that just didn't work.  But this new one is better than the original IMO.  They just use the same old recipe as the original series, maybe a few more options as to who did it, and the places they go are even cooler.  Daphne and Fred have a bit more going on with their characters which is fun.

But mostly, my daughter of 5 really loves them.  Sometimes I just like that it occupies her attention, but I also like chilling on the couch after we have both had long days and catching an episode of my old favorites with my daughter.

It isn't exactly educational programming, which she is forced to watch exclusively in the mornings, but if she is like me it will be her first glimpse into solving mysteries which have brought me a lot of entertainment as I grew up (from Encyclopedia Brown to the Hardy Boys to Sherlock Holmes to Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler)",1215043200,,1258,4.2521008403361344

2768718,5,B000NHG7C0,"I really like the new What's New Scooby-Doo series, and my son loves them.  The new twist to Daphne's character is a nice touch. (My husband thinks the rest of gang are just holding her back.)  All the season's complete DVD collections has a bonus episode, so get the complete sets, not the DVD with 4 episodes a piece to them.  Just the right amount of scare for young kids to keep them interested, but keep the nightmares at bay.",1207526400,,431,4.3625
2768719,5,B000NHG7C0,As the original series.  It brings back great memories and can't help but feel how much i love and still enjoy this series.  I've been a fan for years and this 2nd Season of What's New Scooby Doo.  Is all good with a guest star in the name of Simple Plan.  I love that episode itself just seeing them in the show is cool enough of itself.  But it doesnt ever feel forced or out of place.  I can't help but enjoy each and every episode of this two disc 2nd season.  Look forward to more of it if that happens and this is something is worth the purchase.  Fun to watch for people of all ages.,1188950400,10,590,3.982905982905983

2768751,5,B000NHG7C0,"Great re-imagining of the original. Scooby's grown up over the last 40+ years and Warner Bros has done a very good job of keeping Scooby Doo modern. The only iteration of Scooby Doo to avoid (at all costs) is Scrappy Doo....don't ever. The next iteration even (mystery incorporated) does this show 1 better, highly recommend them both. That being said the only problem I have with ""what's new Scooby Doo is the music during the 'monster montages' I.e. the running scenes. Diet punk isn't my favorite flavor, but the show is still superb",1462492800,2,536,4.774193548387097

Even Scrappy had his moments (a few.)  If you want newer Scooby stuff that really rocks for writing skill and a high level of funny the Mystery Incorporated (2 seasons) episodes are terrific and the new show, Be Cool Scooby Doo is also a really good addition.  I feel sorry for kids who started their Scooby exposure with What's New.  It's turgid and flat for the most part.",1462233600,,520,4.319587628865979

They are not as interesting to me as an adult, but I can say that some of the information is very accurate.  Although I didn't buy them as learning DVDs for my kids and expected them to be only for entertainment, the kids still pick up some interesting information!

2768808,1,B000NHG7C0,"I'm not gonna make someone happy with this review, but I can safely say I did NOT like ""What's New Scooby-Doo."" I could even go as far as saying I hated it! I grew up with classic Scooby-Doo as a kid, even though I wasn't alive yet when the original show started in 1969, I knew about the show during the 1990s, watching reruns of the original ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?"" series on Cartoon Network, along with the ""New Scooby-Doo Movies,"" ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo,"" even the ""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost"" movies were pretty good! Unfortunately, the switching of production companies (from Hanna-Barbera to Warner Bros. Animation, whom has had a long famous legacy since 1930) was a major blow to the series.
With Sander Schwartz (the worst president of Warner Bros. Animation EVER) running things, you know things aren't going to go well. It didn't have that Hanna-Barbera look and feel to the animation; instead it looked more like Adelaide Productions (""Men in Black: the Series,"" ""Jackie Chan Adventures,"" ""Dragon Tales"") produced it instead, and the animation was the usual 2000s ""house"" animation style many WB and Adelaide shows at the time were using, animated in Korea (mostly by Lotto and DongWoo Animation.) It was also pretty much just a parody of the old show, up to the point where the parodies were no longer funny! (EVERY episode had to parody the ""meddling kids"" line, and EVERY episode had to feature some wacky musical chase, etc. And at times some other part of the formula would be lampshaded, like Fred wanting to set a trap BEFORE the gang splits up.) And their use of modern technology as a ""See how up-to-date and modern this show is compared to the old version!"" sort of thing didn't help either (I seem to recall one episode they swiped the ""Uh... Internet?"" joke from the Fairly Odd Parents.)

Fred was also drastically dumbed down, sort of like on ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo,"" but not as funny. And the show rarely focused on Scooby-Doo himself! Usually it would just focus on Fred, Daphne and Velma. The show also generally tried to be more ""realistic"" and more like real-life compared to the older, more cartoony shows. In fact, as part of this they even dumped using the classic Hanna-Barbera sound effects! (Well for the most part, they still used some, but usually it was the same 20 or 30 effects repeated over and over, and in awful sound quality as if they were ripped of 78-RPM records.) Instead, it has more realistic (and LOUDER) sound effects, as well as the same sound effects heard on many Looney Tunes cartoons (since it was by the same company that did the Looney Tunes shorts, so that's a given.)

Definitely not what I hoped for. There were only a few good episodes, and then there were some that were absolute garbage, like many of the episodes on this set, most notably ""The Vampire Strikes Back"" (sorry, even the Hex Girls couldn't save it, and it was also a very poor semi-knock off of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Mouse-Detective-Mystery-in-the-Mist-Edition/dp/B0034GK74G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Mouse Detective (Mystery in the Mist Edition)</a>) Also, it's no surprise many of the staff members that worked on this show also worked on the aborted awful 2003-2004 Looney Tunes cartoons (some of which are also on DVD, like ""Hare and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and ""The Whizzard of OW."")

I was very disappointed and angry at Warner Bros. Animation for ruining the Scooby-Doo franchise, after making four great direct-to-video Scooby-Doo movies. It also makes me sad, because Warner Bros. Animation also made some great Looney Tunes cartoon shorts from the 1930s until the 1960s. I can't believe the company that brought me such classics as ""One Froggy Evening,"" ""What's Opera Doc,"" ""Duck Amuck"" and ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"" would sink so low to making a very subpar Scooby-Doo revival. Ever since then, I haven't trusted Warner Bros. Animation with their new stuff when being announced (such as when ""The Looney Tunes Show"" was about to come out, I was afraid they'd screw up in the same way; like they've screwed up on dumbing down Lola Bunny like they did to Fred here.)
In fact, this show was also very similar to the later Looney Tunes cartoons the company produced in 1967 to 1969 (under the Warner Bros.- Seven Arts banner), mostly run by a new crew who did very ugly Daffy Duck vs. Speedy Gonzales cartoons (like ""Fiesta Fiasco"" and ""See Ya Later Gladiator"") and created Cool Cat and Merlin the Magic Mouse. But then again, even Cool Cat's cartoons were way better than this horrid insult to the Scooby-Doo franchise.

I am very sorry to admit I don't like this; sometimes I feel like a total outcast because I didn't like this show at all, and I'm a Scooby-Doo fan!

Some of the other newer releases in the Scooby franchise have felt too unlike their ancestors (Mystery Incorporated, I'm lookin' at you) but this is right on the money in my opinion.  There is an obnoxious new faux punk theme song but other than that the spirit of the original series is pretty much intact with a more modern feel and HD animation.  This is not too scary for young kids, the plots are silly, the bad guys pretty much always turn out to be dudes in masks, etc.

2768832,5,B000NHG7C0,"In my view, the ""What's New, Scooby Doo?"" Series is the best Scooby Doo series of all time..even better than ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"".

 The animation is fantastic, bright, colorful,and clean. The various destinations that Mystery Inc visits are also beautiful and captures the culture of the particular country that they are in.

  Scooby and Shaggy are closer than ever, funnier than ever, hungrier than ever, and scared out of their minds, more than ever.

  The jokes are hilarious, including the ones that make Fred look like a putz...albeit ""a good putz"".

  The references to the old Scooby shows, such as ""Scooby and Shaggy, you go that way, and Daphne, Velma and I will go this way"", and Scooby and Shaggy always thinking of where the nearest plate of food is, connects the classic Scooby with the updated, yet still classic Scooby. The end of one episode, with Scooby and Shaggy doing their ""Lady and The Tramp"" impression with a plate of Spaghetti and Meatballs, is priceless.

The Halloween episode where the gang goes to see a Kiss Concert, visits a Halloween festival, etc. is my favorite episode, as is the Christmas episode, which takes the classic ""Headless Horseman"" tale, and ""winterizes"" it. The ending of the Xmas show is very touching I must say. Scooby and Shaggy holding one another as they look at the Christmas tree....and present each other with a box of Scooby Snacks as Xmas gifts....very nice. I almost had tears in my eyes.
 Ok, so I'm sensitive, so what? Cant a man be sensitive?  Ahem, sorry for the outburst.

 All three seasons of ""What's New, Scooby Doo?"" are fantastic, and in my view, along with the direct to DVD movies, are Scooby Doo at his best.

  It is wholesome family entertainment.

That's kinda hard to believe. Nine times Scooby has been done. Finally, though, they got it right and I just love this show. Developed and produced by Warner Bros. Animation, it features the vocal talents of Casey Kasem, Frank Welker, Grey DeLisle, and Mindy Cohn(whom everyone remembers from tv's Facts of Life). This season takes you to the exotic locales of Greece, Egypt, Tokyo, Transylvania and even the South Pole. My favorite episodes from this season are: The Vampire Strikes Back, Simple Plan and the Invisible Man, Big Appetite in Little Tokyo and Large Dragon at Large. Extras include a bonus Scooby-Doo halloween episode.

This Scooby Doo is perfect. The monsters are almost always people in costumes or robots and they don't seem to threatening too him. That said if this is the season with the giant dragon, he watched that one much less and never in the morning or late at night. (Really as a parent all the Scooby dvd's begin to run together.) I find the full season dvd's are much better than the longer movies in that I can play one episode in the morning as I pack for work and school and then it has a natural ending in the time frame needed. Longer Scooby movies or ""play all"" have to stopped in the middle (which is always an action scene) and this never goes over well in our household.
