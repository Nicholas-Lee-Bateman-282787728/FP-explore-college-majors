8269746,4,B0018GI4FS,"I was stunned to find that this has never been released on DVD.  There are other documentaries about William Burroughs and I've not watched all of them but I'm very confident that they don't measure up or surpass this one.  It would be impossible to make this film today because many of the people interviewed here are now deceased.  Burroughs himself took part in this film as he comes along with the film makers and introduces them to where he grew up, his old neighbors, past and present lovers, etc.  There's also a lot of archival footage, the footage of his readings on Saturday Night Live, interviews with Allen Ginsberg, and, of course, several readings by Burroughs in that slow nuanced voice of his.

I am not a fan of Burroughs writings but I find him fascinating and he is a good story teller.  I could listen to speak and tell stories for hours on end.  The only drawback is that Burroughs wasn't finished when this movie was made.  He made several film appearences and even did some TV commercials which would seem to go against what the Beat writers were supposed to stand for.  He wasn't a real actor.  He only played himself.  There is no denying he had a presence, something that was apparently wanted and he made some money off of it during the late eighties and early nineties.  It's why someone, such as myself, who dislikes his books can still enjoy a film about him.  This wouldn't be a bad companion piece to Cronenberg's Naked Lunch.

Although this is not available on DVD,  I still recommend that you purchase the VHS.  This valuable document is in real danger of disappearing.  I took my copy and converted it to DVR.  If you have any interest in Burroughs, I strongly recommend you do the same.  The copy I received was a former library copy and was still in excellent condition and the picture quality was still very good despite being over twenty years old.
UPDATE-Thanks to a Kickstarter campaign, this is finally coming to DVD and Blu-Ray and is being released by Criterion Video! Classy!
It should be available December 15, 2015. Buy It!",1362441600,,2070,4.60655737704918
