7474160,5,B016JB0JKY,"As a student of Japan and a fan of magical realism, this hit me in just the right way. I really enjoyed it and so did my kids.",1455321600,3,126,3.5357142857142856
7474161,5,B016JB0JKY,"As a student of Japanese sword technique, I'm constantly disappointed by films and television shows that sacrifice accuracy of technique to be flashy, or to use an actor who can't be bothered to train long enough to show correct form.  I was pleasantly surprised by the attention that went into using real technique and it added an unexpected dimension of immersion for me.  The extensive use of green-screen for the classic Japanese settings might have been distracting if not for the care that went into the fight choreography.

The allegory use here is quite inventive and very eloquently expresses its theme without being obtuse whatsoever.  This is a very very rare thing and should be celebrated loudly from the tops of mountains.

It's a shame that this movie wasn't released on blu-ray because not having a widely available HD version sort of screams ""low quality""  but nothing could be further from the truth.  The writing is terrific, the narrative sophisticated and unapologetic.  The acting was superbly done and hit all of the right emotional notes to be compelling.

Bottom line: if you're wondering if you should buy this movie, you should.  It's awesome.",1455148800,9,1170,5.015544041450777
7474162,5,B016JB0JKY,"The film Masterless is definitely a ""MUST SEE "" !
It sends a beautiful message about good and evil while being entertained by ancient Japanese swordsmen.",1454803200,4,153,4.923076923076923
7474163,5,B016JB0JKY,Went to the Hollywood premiere of this movie and was very touched by it.  The two parallel story lines intertwine with intrigue.  I'd recommend this movie as a gift for those exploring their faith.,1454716800,3,197,4.764705882352941
7474164,5,B016JB0JKY,"I loved how this film mirrored dual time peroids.  Fascinating  Its a spritual film but not to be mistaken as religiuos
Profoundly thought provoking and beaufully shot. A great find.",1510963200,,182,5.033333333333333

7474166,1,B016JB0JKY,I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A SAMURAI MOVIE BUT IT ISN'T.  ITS A CHRISTIAN MOVIE DISGUISED AS A SAMURAI MOVIE.,1509494400,3,104,4.2
7474167,4,B016JB0JKY,"This movie is a great movie of a man who is struggling with many things of the World, it has a very interesting artistic way of showing his struggles in a Samarai kind of way.  The movie is a bit slow, but worth watching.",1486684800,2,221,4.0227272727272725
7474168,2,B016JB0JKY,"Never deceive the buyer, Religion should not be sold without a disclosure!!!!!!!",1477958400,,80,5.75
7474169,5,B016JB0JKY,"There are very few films I've seen that depict the spiritual battle for the soul from a distinctly Christian viewpoint in a such a clear way. After watching it, I felt like revisiting Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. The interplay between the warrior and working life is so clearly linked that you don't need to be spiritual to understand or enjoy this film. Personally I think expanding on the vignettes from Kane's life might have added greater depth without taking away from the film's power, but there's a reason I'll never be a screenwriter.
If you're looking for samurai or martial arts as the point you may be disappointed, here they are just the vehicle. But I appreciated how faithful the author is to a Christian viewpoint.",1472428800,,729,4.84

7474178,5,B016JB0JKY,"Awesome parable of spiritual warfare. It give one a picture of what goes on in the spirit world that corresponds to what we say and do in the physical world.

8736633,5,B016JB0JKY,"Wonderful imagery that you can sink your teeth into. Love the modern detailed look of Kane's real life and the classic natural Japanese black and white of his spiritual realm. Shows the age of the spiritual battle that long existed before Kane, but is closelly tied to who he is and where he came from. It's refreshing to see battles that exist between cultures, generations, and careers tied into a spiritual battle, without being riddled with clichs .",1515283200,,453,4.82051282051282

8736636,5,B016JB0JKY,"Masterless is a Masterpiece. This movie depicts-Looking at the man (or woman) in the mirror, what do you see? Called soul searching {soul =mind, will and emotions}. We are all searching for peace in our hearts but life can be a battle that rages within us and show us that "" No man can serve 2 Masters"" either you love one and hate the other. But light can overcome darkness, because it radiates, shines, and never goes out. So we can become the light of the world, set on a hill that cannot be hid (Matthew 5:14).  That's the message I get from the film  Masterless.

Respectfully,
