8549963,1,B00AC8P8XE,"I paid $17.95 + shipping for a 13 minute commercial re: The New York City Ballet.  I am a dancer and have studied with a number of NYCB dancers.  I do not recommend this DVD.  As much, or more information, can be obtained simply by going to the NYCB website.  What a disappointment.  The DVD basically consisted of a very few minutes of clips of performances - mostly not identified.  More time was devoted to interviewing Peter Martins and listening to Leslie Stahl tell how much she loves ballet.  The dancers, with one or two exceptions, were not identified.  If the company wants to garner more interest, they should have shown a montage of the wonderful variety of ballets presented by NYCB and they should have personalized this product with shots of the full gamut of the dancers' lives, from auditions to performances. NYCB has something for everyone. It was pointed out that ballet dancers are athletes - but that was it - no illustration. The point of all the countless hours of training is to make the performances appear effortless and to transmit the beauty of ballet to the audience.  It would have been so beneficial to really show what goes into an ""effortless"" performance. That would have increased appreciation.  This could have been a wonderful vehicle to expose many more people to the wonderful world of ballet. It fell short of the mark.",1363996800,12,1360,4.748936170212766
