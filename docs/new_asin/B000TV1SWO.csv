8211120,4,B000TV1SWO,"I've become fascinated with Eliot Ness.  He intrigues me.  ""Eliot Ness: An Untouchable Life"" is a well-done look at his life.  I have seen reviews which panned this effort, but my impression is that the reviewers have been disappointed that the production is not visually exciting.  It's a play, for Pete's sake!  Plays never film well.  You have to accept that at the outset.

There is at least one continuity glitch, when ""Ness"" leaves his office without his overcoat, and in the next scene has it on.  No big deal.  One reviewer moaned that there was too much talk.  It's a one-man show.  Have these reviewers never seen ""Mark Twain Tonight?""  Hal Holbrook does a LOT of talking in that one!  It is not the ""action"" (which people want too much of these days) or the continuity blips that matter.  What matters is what is said.

There is a great deal of factual information presented, and the one disappoinment I have with this production is that they did not give their sources in the credits.  I have documentary corroboration for a lot of what is said, and a few documents which contradict some of the facts presented (as, for instance, when ""Ness"" says he got a master's degree; his service record shows that he took one graduate course, but did not get a degree).  I like the interspersing of photographs from Ness's life (and where did they get those?) during the production.

What is presented as fact is not the heart of the play.  How Ness may have felt about it all is the really important part.  There may be documents that back up the feelings and opinions presented as being his, and if there are, I want to see those documents!  It's this part -- the presentation of the character, the insights and feelings -- that is the heart of the production.  These ring true, whether they are or not.  And whether they are or not is not important.  It's the reactions we have, the impressions we get, that matter. That's what a play is about -- reaching us emotionally, getting us to react, to feel, to think.

Cornelison is no Sir Laurence Olivier, but then not many actors are.  He does a creditable job of getting into the character.  He's no Robert Stack, either (and I wonder how the production would have been with him doing the role?), but he managed to hook me.  I noticed immediately the significance of the date we are given at the beginning -- May 16, 1957.  That's the day Eliot Ness died.  If you know that fact, you pretty much know what is coming.  Yet you don't want to see it, you don't want this truly heroic man to go the way he did.",1365724800,,2558,4.471861471861472
