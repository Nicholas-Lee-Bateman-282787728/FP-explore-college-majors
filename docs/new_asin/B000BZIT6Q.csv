8094838,1,B000BZIT6Q,"Imagine the worst low budget movie you ever seen. Well this was worse. The music is bad and picture washed out most of the time. The information would be somewhat useful if the Greek propaganda that all that Macedonia was, is now is in Greece's territory. Historically untrue and full of speculation. Worst buy from amazon.com in the past year.",1230595200,3,344,4.75
8094839,3,B000BZIT6Q,"The birthplace of Alexander the Great. The video itself is very interesting and the excavations at Vergina and the discovery of King Philipp's tomb is outstanding. I would give this video a 5,however the narrator as well as the overall presentation is terrible. Archeology is great. This great video should be redone in a more modern mannor. I hope that a new one with a better narrator will be presented to the public. It looks like somebody is reading without any enthousiasm of this fantasic place like Macedonia. Absolutely no feelings into it.",1171497600,5,548,4.903225806451613
