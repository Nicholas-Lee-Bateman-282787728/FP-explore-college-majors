8249085,2,B00133KFG2,"I would give it one star, but I admit my toddler likes it which is helpful to get her excited for our trip. They give grossly inaccurate historical information (those aren't kings of France on the front of Notre Dame). You won't learn any insider tricks. You don't need a video to tell you to take a tour bus or buy a Paris pass. I personally would skip this one.",1460073600,,363,4.2
8249086,4,B00133KFG2,I saw a few YouTube clips of this and I was very impressed. I learned more about Paris in 2 minutes of this DVD than I did watching the entire Samantha Brown Paris DVD. This contains many practical tips. Just one caveat: I hate kids. I'm 30 years old and I'm not interested in having kids (at least for the time being). I think of Paris as a romantic destination for guys to meet women and for people to go on their honeymoon. The annoying kids killed that illusion. They were too young to appreciate the culture of Paris. It's a shame because there are so few good DVDs pertaining to Paris. The only one I can think of is Rick Steves.,1439769600,,635,4.213114754098361
8249087,5,B00133KFG2,"This video will take you to the Eiffel tower, the Seine River and even to chocolate crepes.  It also includes a visit to the Louvre and Notre Dame Cathedral.",1318118400,,157,4.413793103448276
8249088,2,B00133KFG2,"I was thinking that this video might help us plan a more child-friendly visit to Paris when I checked it out of the library. Unfortunately, it feels more like a vacation video by a family who knows something about video production, but very little about Paris. So, you have a very smooth home movie of someone else's kids climbing on all the touristy attractions anybody just getting off the plane could stumble upon themselves. Really, about the only difference between this travel video and a traditional travel video is that this one has lunch at McDonalds and spends a day a Disneyland Paris. The parents do throw in a handful of tips, such as how to read the subway map or go to a grocery store for cheaper dining. They also have a five minute history lesson driven by clipart. Overall, it just felt like it was little more than two kids going to the same obvious landmarks that every video on Paris would have shown: Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Notre Dame...

I gave it two stars because I felt like I was duped into watching someone else's vacation that they probably got to deduct as a business expense by making a 'travel' video out of it. The five star review at the top was done by someone who only seems to review videos in this series, giving them all five stars, so take that for what it's worth.",1303084800,2,1304,4.4789915966386555
8249089,5,B00133KFG2,"""Travel to Kids -Paris"" is a good CD. I gave it to my granddaughter who is studying French and is interested in travel. Perhaps it will inspire children to travel with their parents on a vacation. Artmajor.",1233619200,,206,4.594594594594595
8249090,5,B00133KFG2,"We watched this excellent DVD guide before, and many times after our recent trip to Paris! What an outstanding job! Finally, a real travel that we all can use. This DVD does NOT show a host eating bizarre foods, as it seems every travel show does now, or going to ""secret hidden"" places that we would never visit, but honest to goodness regular travel. The children in the video make a great addition to a travel guide. The kids are funny, but we think many tantrums were edited out, however the information and great visuals just keeps coming. We actually learned about Paris and France too, which we didn't expect. This show gave us a feel for what our own trip might be like, and put us at ease about taking our own children to Paris. There is Disneyland Resort segments, which our children were very excited to see. The sewer tour segment is a hoot and the scenes from atop the Eiffel Tower are stunning. I highly recommend this video to any family, or really anyone going to France.",1209513600,5,987,4.488888888888889
