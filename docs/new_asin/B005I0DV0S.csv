4707628,4,B005I0DV0S,"I found this in the bargain bin at Wal Mart and picked it up, I expected the standard made-for-tv holiday programs & hallmark channel productions, and I was not disappointed.  ""Borrowed Hearts"", ""Music of the Heart"", ""I'll be Home for Christmas"" and ""Family Thanksgiving"" were more recent programs, the writing & acting were on par with anything else you'd likely watch during the holiday season and the presentations of all were of good quality -  ""Music of the Heart"" was above average, but had nothing really to do with Christmas.  ""A Christmas Without Snow"" is an older program and definitely shows - the audio/video quality is poor.

But the real gem on this set is ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"" - I can only describe this movie as the Welsh equivalent of ""A Christmas Story"" - this is a wonderful little program, while only about an hour in length, it completely captures your attention and makes you feel the wonder of Christmas as you might have experienced from your own childhood & warms your heart like no other holiday program I can think of.  In my opinion, the inclusion of this program is worth the price of the set all by itself.",1323648000,146,1146,4.653465346534653

4707673,1,B005I0DV0S,"A childs Christmas in Wales is very boring.  I think it was made in the 1970s. I couldn't take more than 25 minutes before turning it off.

A Christmas without Snow is not Christmassy at all.  It was very depressing.  Another1970s era movie.  I ended it after about 15 minutes.

Music of the Heart is not a Christmas movie at all.  It is the only movie on this set that was not made for TV.  Its ok.  I suspect this DVD set was made just to showcase that movie.

A Family Thanksgiving is one of those movies the Hallmark channel likes to make where they show a career woman what a big mistake she made with her life by choosing a career over a family.  I just wish for once they made a movie that showed she could have both.  Why is it one or the other.

Borrowed Hearts is good and the best part of this set.  A cranky business owner hires a woman and her daughter to pretend to be his family over the holidays to impress an investor.  Of course, they fall in love.  But, its heartwarming and you should get this one, only don't bother with this set.  Buy this moving on its own.",1389744000,2,1080,4.115384615384615
4707674,5,B005I0DV0S,"This was a gift, I own one as well. These are great family movies that will most likely become a new tradition in your family too!",1389398400,,130,4.038461538461538
4707675,4,B005I0DV0S,"There was anything great on here except A Child's Christmas in Wales.  That was outstanding!  In my opinion it is worth buying the DVD just to see that movie.  The other movies were fun, but nothing to get you too excited.  The quality on the one movie (forget the name it has Michael Learned--I think that is her name--the lady from the Waltons) is poor.  The sound is fine, but the video is very ""smoky"".",1389139200,,406,4.36
4707676,5,B005I0DV0S,Bought this for my mother in law who has everything. She loves this collection and has watched it many times over,1388707200,,113,4.428571428571429
4707677,1,B005I0DV0S,"Purchased this and then had to have another one sent to me and that also has same problems.
They put five (5) full movies on the first disc and one movie plus music on the second disc.
The disc with five movies has no chapter search, and on 4 different dvd players and 1 blu-ray player the disc would only read and play about 20 percent of the time.  I would constantly get the message ""disc can not be read"" and I would have to take it out and put it back in. Once we got it to play the movies were great so long as we did not pause, or fast forward.",1388016000,5,551,3.8761061946902653
4707678,2,B005I0DV0S,"I think that the other collections in this series come out ahead of this one, at least as far as Christmas fare goes; one of the movies actually is about Thanksgiving; another isn't about a holiday at all; and two others simply have Christmas as a backdrop rather than the central focus of the story. The included music is a nice bonus.",1387584000,,336,4.435483870967742
4707679,5,B005I0DV0S,"These are all good movies.  Since I love to hear the violin, The Music of the Heart, was a very touching story that I had not heard before but I have enjoyed it so much along with the others.  Each movie has a very good story and well worth getting.",1387324800,,249,3.96
4707680,5,B005I0DV0S,I love Hallmark Movies and some of my favorites are included in this collector's set. I wish there was a different collection of movies in this set.,1378425600,,148,4.518518518518518
4707681,4,B005I0DV0S,I chose this rating because I liked these movies but I felt that a perfect 5 stars would be too high. The film quality was excellent and I would order from this company again. I would say that all aspects of these films were quite agreeable but had no major impact per se. As there were six films it's difficult to compare them with other films. I can also say they are all family oriented. My grandchildren just adored them. Go Amazon!!!,1376956800,,438,4.353658536585366
4707682,5,B005I0DV0S,"Purchased this because to the one movie ""Borrowed Hearts"".  We enjoyed that this was not one of the dvd's that chop off part of the story line.

4707686,3,B005I0DV0S,"The DVD is hard to start.  It keeps saying ""Error"".  When it finally does start, a couple of the films skip.  Some of the films are okay.  Nothing like I thought they would be.",1369008000,,176,4.088235294117647

4707688,3,B005I0DV0S,out of all the movies only 3 were really good. the quality was a bit shaky on some of the older movies. compared to the others its okay,1367193600,,135,3.857142857142857
4707689,4,B005I0DV0S,"I already own one of these movies (Borrowed Hearts - a good one), I read the synopses of the other movies and they seemed to be Family Value type movies and not counting the one I already had, they turned out to be barely $1.50 each (less if you don't have Borrowed Hearts already. Though I doubt any of these movies will become Christmas Classics, I don't doubt that they are better than any of the so-called Christmas Comedies coming out which I find neither funny nor wholesome. These read like Hallmark Channel movies and I look forward to adding them to my Christmas Collection. Of course, I have no problem watching these types of movies all year long. I do wait until Christmastime to watch the obvious classics (The Christmas Carol & White Christmas etc.).The best part is that I got this DVD movie Collection with a handful of other DVDs from my 'sounds good and shows I've seen and wouldn't mind watching again anytime' list. This order I found 5 such DVD and DVD sets which qualified me for the over $25 gets you Free Shipping. I ended up with 5 DVD items equalling 11full-length shows/movies and 22 one-hour TV episodes . So, I only had to pay the shown item price and tax. Good Deal and makes the movies more affordable",1366502400,2,1232,4.504464285714286

4707694,3,B005I0DV0S,"I really was not impressed at all with these movies.  The one everyone raved about ""A Christmas in Wales"" I was so geared up to see and could not believe anyone could watch more than 1/2 hour without turning it off.  All of the acting was so stilted.  It was a pain just to watch.  However, three of the movies were fine but mostly predictable.  It won't be one I will watch over and over but at least they weren't all bad.",1361145600,,423,4.109756097560975

4707699,4,B005I0DV0S,"I bought this set of five Christmas and one Thanksgiving set movies specifically for ""A CHILD'S CHRISTMAS IN WALES"" which stars the late Denham Elliott.  It's a beautiful, poetic telling and visualization of Dylan Thomas's story. I had it on VHS tape and played it every year at Christmas. Unfortunately, the tape began to show its age so I looked for a DVD of the film and found it in this collection.
This is Volume 3 of Echo Bridge's collection of ""Holiday Collector's Sets.""  Of the six films, five are made-for-TV movies that date back to 1986 (""A Child's Christmas in Wales"") and up to 2010's ""A Family Thanksgiving.""  The one feature film is ""Music of the Heart"" from MIramax in 1999. It stars Meryl Streep and Aidan Quinn. Each film has a sentimental and soap-opera quality to it, as most Christmas stories do: tales of longing, lost love, redemption, overcoming obstacles, friendship, and good cheer. Because these were mostly made for TV the quality is a bit like most TV movies a tad mediocre. The most professional film here, though not the best directed, is """"Music of the Heart.""  If you like holiday stories, the kind that run on Hallmark or Lifetime channels, you will probably enjoy this set. And if you are looking for a specific holiday movie, as I was, check out the other volumes in this series. You may find that long lost treasure as I did.  Now...if only someone would release ""The Snow Goose"" starring Richard Harris and Jenny Augetter on DVD.",1360108800,,1468,4.696498054474708

4707709,4,B005I0DV0S,iI was actually surprised to find this  6 in 1  for less than my original search for Borrowed Hearts -  which I had only seen a portion years ago and didn't really know the title until this past December.  The Quality is as good as any DVD plus I received 5 others (1 of which i would not want to see again)  CANNOT BEAT THE 6 FOR 1 LOW PRICE.  I would reccommend this purchase without a doubt.,1357862400,,394,3.9871794871794872
4707710,3,B005I0DV0S,"Decent, but little more than that. The 'Child's Christmas in Wales' film was interesting because the foreign perspective makes it less predictable. Can't say I'd buy this again, although the price on these 'collections' is low, and I suppose that the value for the money isn't bad.",1357862400,,281,5.0
4707711,3,B005I0DV0S,"nice for the holidays, good clean stories and great for everyone.  I like 6 videos packaged in one cassette box.",1357776000,,112,4.6

4707713,3,B005I0DV0S,"Some of the movies were good, some were boring, and some were simply depressing.  I want my holiday movies to make me smile and feel good about the movies.",1357689600,,155,4.344827586206897
4707714,3,B005I0DV0S,This was supposed to be 6 DVDs and an audio bonus.  We got 2 of the same DVDs - only 5 movies and no audio bonus. Not what we were guaranteed.,1357084800,,142,3.5806451612903225
4707715,5,B005I0DV0S,I loved that I had six holiday movies for the price of one.  I had the unexpected surprise of the Meryl Streep movie entitled Music of the Heart when I really ordered the set for one movie entitled Borrowed Hearts  I found many of the other free movies very interesting.  I especially liked that my order was promptly delivered.,1357084800,,328,4.52542372881356
4707716,4,B005I0DV0S,I have looked at these movies and I love them.  I love all the Christmas Movies.  I saw these and wanted to add to my movies.,1356912000,,125,3.769230769230769
4707717,2,B005I0DV0S,"I was not impressed by the quality of the reproduction of these movies. Poor light and fuzzy images were the norm. But still, these are cheesy, feel-good, Christmas movies that we like to watch during the holiday season.",1356825600,,220,4.815789473684211
4707718,5,B005I0DV0S,"I received this promptly and I watched one movie a night.
They are sweet simple stories that put you in a Christmas mood.
I can watch them over and over.",1356739200,,153,4.133333333333334

4707720,5,B005I0DV0S,"I got this DVD for the movie ""Borrowed Hearts"" as I love a good fairytale with a happy ending.  This is one movie I love to see over and over again.  This Cinderella type puts me in the world of enchantment as if I could be her.
The other that I enjoyed was ""Music of the Heart"".  It has an exciting climax that gives you the feeling that you are a part of it.  This movie is not a childs movie when it comes to romance because it is adult mind leading in some of the first parts.  On into the movie, it mellows to be very happy and exciting.  Inspirational....All other movies are very nice and you do get your moneys worth.",1356480000,21,625,4.040650406504065
4707721,3,B005I0DV0S,"The best film is is A Childs Christmas in Wales, its worth the money on its own, the other ones are ok.",1356220800,22,103,3.727272727272727
4707722,5,B005I0DV0S,"Each movie on here is worth this price of this one DVD, except possibly ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"" This isn't your typical movie and it's only 55 minutes long, however it is enjoyable and a nice addition to your Christmas movie collection.",1355875200,,243,4.674418604651163
4707723,2,B005I0DV0S,"Out of the 6 movies, only 3 were watchable. The other 3 were very poor quality and hard to watch. I would not recommend this set.",1355788800,,129,4.0
4707724,3,B005I0DV0S,"For the price the collector set was really good. I don't know if I'd buy them again, if I had not seen them but because I have them, I'll rewatch some of them next year.",1355788800,,169,3.857142857142857

4707727,3,B005I0DV0S,"I purchased this DVD to add some new variety to our Christmas movies this year.  I LOVED two of the movies ""Borrowed Hearts"" and ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"".  I was NOT impressed at all with ""A Christmas Without Snow"" or ""A Childs Christmas in Wales"" (I hope I got that right), in fact, I shut them off and moved on after watching them for about 20 minutes.  I have yet to watch the other two, but the  two I liked were worth the money spent.",1355184000,,443,4.116279069767442
4707728,3,B005I0DV0S,The Christmas snow movie and Christmas in Whales brought the rating of this set down for me.  I liked the other 4 movies quite well...great actually but was very disappointed in the two...otherwise I would have rated this a 4 star for sure!,1354838400,,240,4.5813953488372094

8474073,3,B005I0DV0S,"You have two duddy movies--Chrismas without Snow and  Christmas in Wales.
The movies are very old and very snail pace to watch. The other movies are better.
Best movie of the 6 is Borrowed Hearts! 2nd place would me music of the heart with
Meryl Streep about violins and teaching them. Home for Christmas is a little slow but
Ann Julian does a perky job. Thanksgiving move is ok...a little predictable.",1489622400,,402,4.661971830985915
