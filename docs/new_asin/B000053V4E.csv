7930126,5,B000053V4E,This DVD is not meant to be a history lesson on autopsies or on the person the autopsy is being performed. It is meant for people to see what an autopsy is and how it is performed. I work in the funeral service industry. This DVD is very well done and informative. A must see for anyone considering a career in the mortuary industry.,1293840000,,333,4.21875
7930127,1,B000053V4E,"This DVD seemed like it was filmed cheaply and made in a basement (creepy thought.)  It was very dark, and well, just not educational.  It didn't seem professional or medical.  I have gotten more out of Dr. G, Medical Examiner on TV.  Don't bother to buy this.  There are better ways to learn about an autopsy.",1264032000,,310,4.464285714285714
7930128,2,B000053V4E,"I bought the DVD with an eye toward using it in a forensic evidence class. Unfortunately, the sound on the video is dismal. The doctor mumbles and the other pathologists look like deer in headlights. You would think there might be more than one choice for a topic as educational as an autopsy.

The reviewer who mentioned lack of context is exactly right. No history was provided, and to come to closure on the actual c/o/d was no small accomplishment either.",1128038400,10,459,4.666666666666667
7930129,1,B000053V4E,"You would be better served and entertained watching the HBO series ""Autopsy"" with Dr. Michael Baden.  This struck me as a cheap and quick attempt to cash in on the popularity of forensic science. In this film you witness an autopsy of an elderly woman.  No history is given and no explanation is given as to what is being done or why.  If you do not have any medical training or background, you won't get anything from watching this.",1127433600,11,433,4.455696202531645
7930130,5,B000053V4E,"Great DVD, not for children, but very educational. This DVD shows every aspect of an Autopsy, from Speculating the cause of death, preparing the body, incisions, descriptions of what is being looked at and why, including weights, to the conclusion of the autopsy! This DVD gives you the feeling that you are actually a part of the Autopsy yourself!",1101254400,15,348,4.915254237288136
