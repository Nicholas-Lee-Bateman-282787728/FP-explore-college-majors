1221079,5,B00000IC9T,"This was a real American story. Whenever mainstream America talks about ""family values"" and ""American families"" it's always a lilly white picture of ""the cleavers"" but the truth is that the story of American families has many faces, and ""family values"" are influenced by the history of trials and tribulations that a family goes through. This is a great example of that. This story is important, sentimental, educational, and heart warming. On top of that it has great performances by many great African American actors, as well as the phenomenal Miss Cicely Tyson who is an American stage and screen legend. This is great entertainment, and a different view of a American family that puts the cleavers to shame.",1392336000,3,712,4.991596638655462

1221132,5,B00000IC9T,"I like watching black movies that have gone straight to dvd, simply because in most cases they are good movies more then capable of big screen status. I thought that Mama Flora's Family was excellent. It seemed more like a movie that would be a tv special or made for tv movie but at any rate it was great. It has an amazing cast, Queen Latifah, Cicely Tyson, Blair Underwood, Shemar Moore, Hill Harper, Erika Alexander and an appearance by Della Reese. The movie is set in Mississippi during 1970, but it flashbacks to the early 1900's and goes back forward to 1970. Cicely Tyson tells her story of her life from when she was a young girl up until 1970.

Her family are sharecroppers and they farm land that is owned by Shemar Moore's family. Moore sees Flora and he hires her to come and work in his house to care after his grandmother, in actuality he really wants her as his whore. When she refuses sex one night he fires her and sends her back home single and pregnant. He threatens to evict Flora's family off his farm land unless she gives up her baby. Flora's father takes her newborn and gives it to Moore and then is told to make Flora leave town. He sends her on a train to Memphis, due to advice from the conductor she ends up settling in some rural country part of Tennessee. Once there she gets a job and starts a new life without her family and baby. The story flashes back to 1970 and back again because she is telling her story to Queen Latifah (grand daughter). From there she tells the story of her life and how she managed to get to the point where she is in 1970.

The movie is outstanding everyone gives a great performance. The most amazing part of the movie is that Flora ends up being reunited with her baby later on in the movie.",1304726400,2,1755,4.2990936555891235
1221133,4,B00000IC9T,"As an African-American I am interested in movies about Black history, Black culture, and life during slavery and historical black events.
As a result I purchased about a dozen DVDs on various subject matter which I am just now getting around to viewing.
Another heartwarming story from Alex Haley the author of Roots. With flash backs to slavery time before WW II
A good educational look at African American life during the 1900's and during a period of the Vietnam War when I was active in the military myself. Blacks struggling to make a life for themselves and their family.
Good all around educational movie.",1294531200,5,612,4.838095238095238
1221134,4,B00000IC9T,"What I Can Tell You:

I sat down expecting to like this movie and ended up loving it.  I mean it is based on an Alex Haley book and full of great actors and actresses. Mama Flora (Cicely Tyson) is telling her life story to her granddaughter and great-grandchild. Young Mama Flora played by Erika Alexander brought me to tears.

Young Flora steals the eye of young Lincoln Flemming (Shemar Moore).  Her family ""loans"" her to his family
to do housework and tend to an elder family member. Flora falls in love with Lincoln and experiences first love. When she finds out that he is also seeing other woman she turns his advances down. She is forced back home.  We see her give birth. She holds her baby crying that it is the happiest day of her life.  Lincoln rides up stating that he is there for the baby. It is taken from a drained Flora right after birth as she screams and cries.

Her family ushers her out of town and she is on her own. She finds love again and has a son, Willie. When her husband is caught stealing for his families needs, he is shot and killed right in front of her.

Floras wants her son to have a good life. Willie grows up, has three children, and when Flora's first son comes looking for her, the family must come to gripes with many obstacles and challenges.

The movie is full of heartbreak, triumph, history, warmth, family and hope.

I deserves a second viewing which I hope to do this week. Very good movie.",1294358400,,1437,4.3283582089552235

When I seen it was for sale on Amazon I couldn't wait to purchase it. It was getting harder to find this disc ANYWHERE (even in the big chain stores like Walmart,Target,etc.)Erika Alexander,Ms. Tyson,Queen LaTifah,Mario Van Peoples, and Blair Underwood all are outstanding actresses and actors. This movie tells about the strengh a mother has to keep her family together. It will make you cry,angry, and happy throughout the entire movie.

1221160,5,B00000IC9T,"Cicely Tyson is one of the greatest actresses in the world at least in my opinion. In this film, she carries elder Flora Henning Palmer with grace, dignity, class, strength and beauty despite the obstacles that her character has to face such as the cold-blooded murder of her husband as he was killed by white men for simply stealing cotton and they get away with it. The actress who plays young FLora does an excellent job in bringing the character to life. I believe it is Erika Alexander and she is fantastic as the mother, daughter, and sister who leaves her family behind in small town Mississippi after the birth of her baby that was ripped from her arms by his father. Della Reese has a small but unforgettable role as the grandmother Nana who is cared for by Flora. When Flora rejects her employer's advances, she is dismissed and sent home in disgrace where she give birth to a boy months later. Flora has known poverty almost her entire life. She goes to Baltimore to save her granddaughter played by Queen Latifah and her great-grandson. She begins to tell the story of her life such as the egg that was hers. There are brilliant scenes mostly because of Cicely Tyson's ability to capture the moment and scene. She sends chills down my spine because she is so brilliant in any role that she takes including the role of Flora. Any other actress could have done satisfactory but Cicely always adds another level of depth to the character and the role itself. She should have won an Emmy for this performance easily.",1215993600,4,1524,4.606617647058823
1221161,5,B00000IC9T,A excellent movie! Cicely Tyson is a superb actress and has never failed to amaze me with her talents. This show is so heart warming! Hubby & I both loved it.,1209686400,,158,4.129032258064516
1221162,5,B00000IC9T,"I bought this movie to watch for a project in school. I'm so happy I selected this movie because I was completely captivated from beginning to end, which made it a lot easier to write out my five page paper.",1193702400,,207,4.2
1221163,3,B00000IC9T,"MAMA FLORA'S FAMILY is a sweeping chronicle of seventy years in the life and descendants of one Flora Henning Palmer. Cicely Tyson who seems to be forever cast in these roles portrays the adult Flora, a woman who has survived prejudice from her own people, the hard and unfair life of sharecropping,the removal of her first newborn son of a ""high yellow"" plantation owner's son,the growing up of her children, the murder of her husband at the hands of white men,the inner conflicts of her own children and her ever present faith that gives her the inner fortitude to carry on.

This is typically HALLMARK HALL OF FAME material made for television. The script is based upon some true characters from author of ROOTS Alex Haley's life. Unfortunately, the dialogue is pretty inane and the plot is formulaically predictable. MAMA FLORA'S does not have at all the intensity of ROOTS and seems very jammed into 140 minutes. Scenes and years fly by without proper time for real character development or time to digest anything. It seems that the writers seemed intent on cramming in 70 years of history without allowing much character conflict. What is there is very contrived despite all noble efforts to handle a very necessary subject. The talents of Queen Latifah, Blair Underwood and Mario Van Peebles are truly wasted in such a sanitized screenplay. The action and characters feel forced and contrived. Only Erika Alexander as the young woman Flora is allowed to show any depth of feeling in this ""chock-full-get-it-all-in"" made-for-television drama.

HALLMARK lovers will adore this production. Everything is nice and tidy and ""safe"" in this 1998 melodrama epic. Anyone that demands more from scripts and actors will look elsewhere. One viewing will suffice.

Better and more satisfying companion films would be WHEN WE WERE COLORED, THE COLOR PURPLE,BELOVED and THE GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI.",1185148800,8,1889,5.087096774193548
1221164,4,B00000IC9T,"This was a great movie all the way thru. It was a little long but worth watching. I loved the cast, many of the great actors are in this movie. Even though this film was not based on any one persons life, you will find a bit of history and a bit of a reminder of how close our black families can be.",1152057600,3,299,3.761904761904762
1221165,5,B00000IC9T,"I must have cried or come close watching this movie about a dozen times.  This is a great movie about a strong lady who has survived so many upheavals in her life as a poor black woman who never loses her sense of self worth or the importance of integrity.  Cicely Tyson is wonderful as always, and Erika Alexander has the ability to act well without saying a word as the young Flora.  It takes a great actress to speak with her eyes the way Alexander did!

A wonderful mixture of heartbreak, warmth, and hope fuel this story along, and Queen Latifah also proves herself to be one heck of an actress.  I dare you to sit down and watch this wonderful movie that approaches individual accountability the right way without crying and smiling a lot.  It's a rich story anybody can learn a lot from about making mistakes and taking steps to correct them.",1132444800,27,849,4.445161290322581
1221166,1,B00000IC9T,"I very disappointed because I saw the movie on TV and wanted to add it to my video collection.  But the video I ordered did not have the whole movie on it and I think you should have made it clear that I was not getting the whole movie and then I would have ordered the cd if it had the whole movie on it.  This was not good business, I wll never order anything from you again. And I told my friends and family not to order from you either.

Flora and her family face life in the Jim Crow South, WWII, Civil Rights, Vietnam, and Black Panther eras. I personally was interested with Flora's mixed relationship with the white family who employs her.
