4648681,3,B005BX3NKK,"This is my first time ever writing a review ever.  I own several of Leslie's DVDs, including the 3 Mile Bootcamp.  I had thought I mastered the Bootcamp DVD, even with the boosted walking,  and thought I was ready for a new challenge, so I purchased this new DVD.  Although I will say I felt like I was going to die trying to do the 5 miles, I must say that I really don't like the format of this DVD at all.  The DVD doesnt flow through the 5 miles, it kinda stops after each mile, and then the next mile starts a totally new segment, with Leslie in a totally new outfit.  What I am trying to say is that you ll get your heart rate up in the first mile, then it fades to black and then the next mile you are going at a slower pace and you have to start up all over again, which is frustrating when you find your groove and then you have to re-establish it again.

I will agree with another reviewer's comments in that the moves are very repetitive,there are only so many times you can do the side step per mile before its just boring. During mile two she mentions that they are going to do the quick step and remember it from the first mile, however it was never in the first mile, so it was a little confusing.  Also, the last part of the 5th mile and the cool down are pretty much the same thing, and the stretches are the same old calf stretch she does in every video.  I wished this video had addtl floor exercises for the abs or legs at the end, kinda like the Bootcamp video, but it did not.  I am not trying to be nit picky, but  its time to add some new stuff to the old.

I did give this 3 stars as it does kick your butt, but its really choppy and I wish it flowed better and transitioned into the next mile like the rest of her DVDs did.  I will continue to work out to her DVDs, but won't rush to get the next new one right away until more reviews are made.  I felt I kinda jumped the gun on this one and should have gone with either the 4 mile or an earlier 5 mile DVD.",1318032000,115,1983,3.9127182044887783
4648682,4,B005BX3NKK,"One of Leslie's better workouts.  Not as fast as some,but lots of good moves especially for strength training.  Best Music of all vids.  I do wish she'd do a five mile with just really fast aerobic activities at some point in the future.  This is a very good overall work out though.",1317945600,,283,4.384615384615385
4648683,1,B005BX3NKK,"I am a long time user of Leslie videos.  This is an honest review! I love her, and I've lost lots of weight with her help.  So this is not an easy review for me to right, but I want others who really use the reviews to purchase things (like I do)to get the real scoop on this DVD.

This is one of the worst Leslie videos I own.  It's a total disappointment for several reasons:

1.  It's slow. Let me say right away, if you are used to doing at least five MPH cardio this is not the video for you.  If you are working your way up to five miles then you might benefit.  Most miles are fifteen minutes.  I'm used to doing 10-12 minutes miles so this is not a good workout.  I don't think I'll be buying another Leslie video unless she picks up the pace.

2.  It's repetitive.  The same steps are repeated over and over...and over.  I did like when she introduced new combinations of her old standbys, but mostly you were strolling forwards and backwards at a leisurely pace.  The worst part is that even though it's repetitive there seem to be several moments where she loses her place.

3.  It's cheesy.  The hit music it mentions on the cover...well those were hits back in the disco era maybe.  And they are covers, nothing by the original artists.  Don't boast about the music when it's that bad.

4.  It's boring.  With the slow miles, the repetitive steps, and the canned music, it just isn't interesting.  And there isn't any ""Classic Leslie"" to make you laugh a little.  It's just sad, really.

My final concern is that I don't believe these people actually exercise daily/weekly with Leslie, as I have in her previous videos.  If they do, then I'm sorry and it was a pretty poor marketing choice to use them.  Most of the people who use these videos will never look like the women in this one, and it is really difficult to relate to them.  The ""normal"" looking (but still fit) people are very obviously pushed to the back and mostly ignored by Leslie.  And this, more than the rest of it, will be the reason I likely never buy another one of her DVDs.",1317859200,34,2059,4.300261096605744
4648684,5,B005BX3NKK,"Just got Leslie's new DVD and I love it!  It's a 5 mile workout with lots of different moves and fresh new music --including a few songs I know and can sing along with.  Mile 1 is a nice fast paced walk with a big group of walkers.  Mile 2 incorporates strength training with a stretchy band, but incorporates it with walking so you don't lose your cardio by stopping to do the band.  Mile 3 is a fast paced, 12 minute mile.  Mile 4 is a mini boot camp with intervals of walking and strength training with the stretchy band.  These middle miles have smaller groups of walkers with Leslie. The 5th mile is back to the big group to finish up.  This DVD has separate tracks for warm up, cool down and stretch so it's easy to customize a workout that is shorter than the whole 5 miles.  I've done a lot of Leslie DVDs -- this one is definitely a nice change of pace and a great fast-paced walking workout!",1317772800,220,901,4.167630057803469
4648685,5,B005BX3NKK,"Just picked this up at wal mart (sporting goods section) for $10 and wow am I glad I did! Totally new DVD (sometimes leslie ""repackages"" older videos which is frustrating because she doesn't alert the buyer on the pkg of such) some new moves, new faces and great music!!",1317772800,66,270,4.530612244897959
4648686,5,B005BX3NKK,"I picked up this new DVD at Target this past weekend.  I used it today and I thought it was great.  There are some different moves than the ones I've seen in the 9 or 10 videos I have purchased over the past several months.  The warm up is separate from the actual first mile.  Miles 2 and 4 incorporate the stretch band.  Mile 3 is a 12 minute mile.  The cool down walk is also a separate track - during which time we meet Leslie's brother.  I'm glad I bought this DVD.

I plan on ordering Leslie's other DVD from Amazon due out October 4th.",1316476800,39,542,4.047169811320755
4648687,5,B005BX3NKK,I've doing her work outs for years and I love them! Can't wait to get this new one..Sooo excited...YAY for Leslie!!!!!!!!!!,1316476800,,123,4.904761904761905
4648688,1,B005BX3NKK,"I haVE nearly all Leslies DVD's and I walk every day.  My favorite is 4 FAST MILES, I love that one!  I do it every other walk and sometimes back to back.  I was in my 2nd set of intervals feeling great last week when I rolled my ankle and had to go to the ER.  When the Doc said I shouldn't walk for a week I WAS DEVASTATED.  I waited 3 days and then went to the ""easy"" end of my Leslie DVD collection and walked a mile.  The next night 1 1/2 miles and now, after 10 days I'm back up to 3 miles.  I just couldn't stop and it has been beneficial in keeping my ankle limber.  I just use Leslies slower No boosted walking DVD's.  Hoping to get back to 4 Fast Miles in another week.  This Walking Program was the best thing I could've found.  After 14 years of Step Aerobics my knees and my feet are shot and this program allows me a great Cardio workout without hurting my knees.  It keeps me healthy. I'm 58 years old and I do at least 4 to 5  miles a day (when I'm not injured).  Great Program.  I love Leslie, it's like walking with my best friend.  Try it, you'll get hooked too!",1314316800,12,1081,3.912442396313364
4648689,5,B005BX3NKK,"This is my second time ordering 5 really BIG miles. My first copy was taken from me, having it back again is like having a walk with a good friend in your own home",1519171200,,163,3.823529411764706
4648690,5,B005BX3NKK,"Good for more experienced walkers.  I like the segments that utilize toning bands.  Unfortunately, the fifth mile is a little too basic, and feels like a cool down during the last five minutes.",1510272000,,193,4.818181818181818
4648691,5,B005BX3NKK,Great way to get consistent and powerful results!,1504483200,,49,5.25

4648693,5,B005BX3NKK,Have several of her videos.  This is one of my favorites.,1500768000,,57,4.181818181818182
4648694,4,B005BX3NKK,"This is a very good DVD for inclement weather.  I wish there were a way to just watch it and show written prompts, so you could play your own music after you become familiar with the moves.  If you do all 5 miles plus warm up, cool down and stretch, plan to spend 1.5 hours, but it is segmented for each mile, and 2 of the 5 miles contain strength training as part of the mile.  I sometimes use light hand weights rather than the band because it can be cumbersome and hard to control.  Also, if you plan to use the band, it IS latex, so if you have a latex allergy, plan to get your own band.  This is good for beginners to the fitness world, and for those like me who have two left feet as it contains no complex dance moves or routines.  All five miles are completed with no floor or mat work, which I like.  To me, this is a good stepping stone before graduating to harder things like kettle bell routines, Jillian, or P90X or whatever that's called.  She seems genuine and is easy to understand and follow.  I first borrowed this from my local public library and liked it enough to buy my own copy.  I have definitely used it plenty.",1498867200,2,1137,4.1506849315068495

4648711,5,B005BX3NKK,i just purchased the miracle mile 5 dvd set and im loving it.  Leslie is a great instructor and she motivates you with moves that increases your cardio burn plus a full body workout.  you can select which miracle mile workout you want or follow the calendar its up to you. i actually look forward to working out and have lost alot of inches and if you follow the meal plan the pounds will come off as wel.. I have become more flexible and have more stamina lm loving it!!!!!!!!!!!!,1475971200,,481,4.333333333333333

4648714,3,B005BX3NKK,I didn't care for this program as much as the other walk at home dvds I own. The music sometimes is so loud you can't hear the instructions. It did a lot of lower body work outs with the bands that I can not do becausecof an injury to my leg,1473292800,,241,3.7450980392156863
4648715,4,B005BX3NKK,Liked this LS video. I wish they had the very first one I bought years ago. Amazon has it to rent but it would be great if we can purchase it to keep. I'm old school. I like her first group of walkers. The video I speak of is walk away the abs 3 miles with the belt.,1472428800,,266,3.603448275862069
4648716,5,B005BX3NKK,"I absolutely love this DVD!  It is great because the 5 miles are broken into 1 mile segments so, I can start and stop the DVD as needed to fit into my schedule.  Great workout!!",1472169600,,177,4.0285714285714285

4648718,5,B005BX3NKK,"I love this workout and I also love the toning band sections that are included.  I feel like I've gotten some decent toning in!  Leslie is always fun to watch and very encouraging and easy to follow.  As I mentioned in another review of one of her DVD's though, I do wish you could customize the workout to set the warm-up, cool down, and whatever miles you want to do.  You can't do that with this DVD.  Other than that, I give it two thumbs up!",1471737600,,446,4.1395348837209305

4648720,5,B005BX3NKK,I love all of Leslie Sansone's walking videos.  I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a place to start and continue with their workouts.  I have her walk away the pounds DVDs also so I interchange them to keep it interesting.,1468627200,,233,4.523809523809524
4648721,2,B005BX3NKK,"Frankly, I am at the end of my patience with Leslie and her repeated ""hey guys"" ""I love to walk, I love to walk"", and on and on. My husband asks me to lower the volume, as he cannot tolerate her constant chatter. When she walks around among her walkers it is distracting and boring. What really annoys me is purchasing a dvd only to find out that it is one previously purchased, with a different cover. I cannot tell you how many of these I have. Of course, they cannot be returned because they are open.
I am now purchasing dvds by other instructors. Enough! Same moves over and over and over.  Never break a sweat.
There are lots of other instructors out there; I suggest you try them.",1466985600,,687,4.2846153846153845
4648722,5,B005BX3NKK,This is definitely one of Leslie's best I love the stretchy band it's at a high rate but still low impact is an awesome fat burn,1465603200,,128,3.9615384615384617

4648728,4,B005BX3NKK,"I own quite a few of Leslie's videos, and I was looking for a challenge, so I thought this one would do it. I really like the first 3 miles, both the pace and most of the moves. I especially like the upper body band work. The fourth mile nearly killed me, and I'm in pretty good shape! My only issue with her lunge/squat segments is I always feel like speed is more important than accuracy. It's really hard for me to get a good, deep lunge and squat accomplished at that pace. During those segments, I try to tune her out and focus on quality, not quantity. Also, the fifth mile seemed like a waste of time. A lot of chatting and simple, slow moves. I was completely cooled down by the end. Overall, not a bad video. It doesn't replace my favorites, 5 Mega Miles and Four Mile Power Walk, but I will definitely make it part of my video rotation.",1460851200,,846,4.196319018404908
4648729,5,B005BX3NKK,"My wife and I enjoy exercising together and this particular dvd gives you the choice of doing as many miles you feel like walking. If you're not sure how much time or energy you have, you can just start it and when you need to cut things short, you simply skip to the cool down. We own three of her dvds and this is a very good addition to our collection.",1459728000,,355,4.014084507042254

4648733,5,B005BX3NKK,"Leslie has been my ""go-to-girl""for many years.  Her bubbly, uplifting and pleasant personality lifts you out of any bad mood
and gets you up off the couch and moving.  I have many of the older DVDs but this one has fresh music and
a new cast of walkers. I had so much fun that I forgot I was doing an exercise routine.

4648740,3,B005BX3NKK,"This is probably my least favorite dvd by Leslie.  Still a good work out but the flow is not as good especially as you progress further into the miles.  By the 5th mile, just a mess.  Family members and couples celebrating anniversaries.  Leslie is so sweet, she seems like the type who allows others to be apart of her success and has used her dvd to do these camio's and shout outs.  Good work out but all the extra people throws her off her game.",1451088000,,449,4.235294117647059

4648745,1,B005BX3NKK,"I am a huge Leslie fan, but this DVD was awful. One: I do not wish to work out with 23 year old hardbody hotties. Two: Leslie sure as heck isn't doing all 5 miles consecutively, which I find disappointing and just condescending. Three: the moves are repetitive, and new ones thrown in require too much floor space. Four: this is in the ""Just Walk"" series but packaged in the ""Walk at Home"" title. I feel duped, because I despise her entire ""Just Walk"" series for all of the reasons above.",1442620800,4,488,4.373626373626373
4648746,3,B005BX3NKK,It is a good work out but I don't like that it  displays on the screen every second that I have been walking.  When I exercise I want to zone out and be pleasantly surprised when the work out is done.  This DVD makes me aware of every single second as it passes and the work out seems to take FOREVER!!!!!!!!,1442361600,2,308,4.016393442622951
4648747,5,B005BX3NKK,"Love it!  This is a great workout; easy to follow and easy to modify if you need to do so.  The music is good and Leslie is her usual bubbly self. The miles can be done together or separately. The warm-up, cool down and stretches are separate, too.  This makes it easy to use whichever section you want.",1442275200,,303,4.189655172413793
4648748,3,B005BX3NKK,"I seem to be in the minority regarding this work out.  I own over 20 of Leslie's DVD's (needless to say, I'm a fan) and this is one of my least favorites.  Yes, I get a decent workout but I spend the entire 1 1/2 hours wishing it was over.  Leslie doesn't seem to be as bubbly in this one and I get the impression she wishes it were over as well.  She's not leading very well, giving commands at the last minute so that sometimes I miss the first step of some of the excercises and this gets annoying after awhile because you feel you're just not getting it.  During the 4th mile she does the one thing I hate (luckily she only does this in one other of her DVD's that I own) and that is that she breaks up the walking workout with intervals of standing excercises like lunges and squats.  If she does lunges and squats, I prefer she save them til the end of the workout in a seperate segment like she does on so many of her other DVD's.  To stop doing cardio and stand for 2 minutes doing lunges and squats and then go straight into a 2 minute boosted walk, it's just annoying to me.  And she does the lunge/squat combo which is an excercise I don't particularly like, I prefer to do them seperately since, by combining them you can't get into the full lunge fast enough before you have to go back to a squat so you end up doing only half lunges which don't work the legs as well.  And then when she goes into mile 5 which is all cardio, you feel that the workout should be over because you've stood still for 2 minutes doing squats so I feel like I'm forcing the final mile even though I'm not tired.  Toward the end of the mile the music slows so much that you assume you're in cool down but Leslie says you're not in cool down.  By the end of the mile you're totally cooled off and she announces you've done 5 miles and it's time for cool down.  But you're already cooled down.  Also during the final mile, she has Brianna get on a lap top and hook up to facebook to tell Leslie what the people are saying who are working out at home, but the way they do it is so forced.  First, you can hardly hear Brianna but that's okay since Leslie asks her toward the beginning of the mile what people are saying and Brianna says something and then Leslie seems to forget all about Brianna until nearly the end of the mile when she suddenly remembers she's supposed to be talking to people on facebook.  The whole thing feels forced and unnceccessary.  The music itself is okay, it's just the flow of the workout and the missed cues and the fake cool down followed by an unneccessary cool down. . . All in all, this is one I'd skip if I hadn't bought it.  There are better workouts by Leslie, I suggest buying one of them.",1442016000,13,2715,4.140952380952381

Sometimes I just want a quick 12 min. mile so that I can feel like I've done something without taking a lot of time to do it. The other miles are about 15 min. My video didn't come with a workout band because it was used but I use light hand weights and can still get a good resistance workout.,1437782400,,391,3.7804878048780486

4648769,5,B005BX3NKK,I've been working out to Leslie Sansone for a few years now.  I was looking for something more advanced...and this is.  It's a really good (long) workout...about 75 minutes...2 of the 5 miles using the resistance band...it is a total body workout.  The only complaint that I have is the music is so loud that it's hard to hear Leslie's instructions.,1427846400,,349,4.688524590163935

4648772,5,B005BX3NKK,"I got tired of the three mile version I had and so I got this one to step it up a bit. I love it! Music is better, workout is more diverse and adds resistance bands which make a big difference. Mile 1 is lower impact, mile 2 is lower impact mixed with upper body resistant bands, mile 3 higher impact, mile 4 lower impact with resistance bands for legs, mile 5 is lower impact again. That's it in a nutshell. Each mile is 15 minutes or less and you can adapt to your level of ability. I like that I can do all 5 when I have time but I can alternate miles on other day. They do not have to be done together or in order.",1427068800,4,618,3.8359375

I am already sore and pretty sure I will be hurting tomorrow. It isn't physically hard but keeping your heart rate up for that long kicks your butt! I really enjoyed the toning band as well. Squats and lunges are much more tolerable with it. I just had to get on here and give this DVD a good review. It was so great that I didn't even care that the music was horrific. I calculated how many calories I lost using an online tool and it said I burned about 1,200 calories so I am HAPPY because I thought I could only burn that much by running in such a short amount of time. Great workout!!!! Plus they have 2 girls who are super fit in crop tops and it is a motivator because you keep looking at them with envy, haha.",1422316800,2,847,3.9244186046511627

4648783,5,B005BX3NKK,"This workout is SO versatile! That's why I love it.  You can choose your miles you want or do all of them at once. The menu is easy to get to so you can skip to what you want to do.  The miles, 2 and 4,  that use the firm band are very effective.  I can tell I worked my arms by the end of the day after doing this one.  One thing I always look for on the reviews is how long each mile is.  I haven't seen ANY of the reviews doing that so for those of you that look for that, this is the breakdown:

Warm Up:  5:16 mns
Mile 1: 15:50 mns
Mile 2: 14:18 mns (w/Firm Band)
Mile 3: 12:25 mns (Speed Mile)
Mile 4: 15:25 (w/Firm Band)
Mile 5:  15:05 mns
Cool Down & Stretch: 9:33 mns

I would say this isn't really for beginner's if you plan on doing the entire workout at once.  Maybe take 1 to 2 miles with the warm up and be sure to cool down and stretch.  For advanced or intermediate 3 miles to the entire DVD is definitely possible.  I consider myself intermediate and get a great workout and sweat after 3 miles!  The entire DVD is a little too much for me currently.  Since I've re-started doing Leslie's DVD's, my arthritis in my knees is getting much better.  You can always do something else if what she's doing is hard on your joints, or just walk in place until you get to a part where you can then follow her again.  HIGHLY recommend this DVD to anyone and everyone at whatever stage of walking you are at!  Have fun!",1417910400,3,1424,3.9717314487632507

I started with Leslie's one mile walk and then progressed up to this DVD, it was a perfect transition as I was healing and getting stronger.

You can modify by making moves smaller or even hold light hand weights and make the moves larger for more intensity.  I have used this video many times and it's pretty fun, but the last mile especially is extremely irritating even if you have a high ""Leslie tolerance"" factor.  For that reason only, I don't do it too often and when I do, I mute the chatter--it's that annoying.  Facebook friends, ""I love love!"", and her family and friends love fest are just too much.  It may not get to you the first few times, but believe me, it will begin to grate on your nerves like finger nails on the chalkboard.  Leslie's videos are biomechanically sound, long enough to burn calories, and very doable for all levels, but if you can't take the cutesy in this video, try one of the other ones.",1391040000,3,925,4.542168674698795

I told my husband that it would probably be the same as Walk Away the Pounds because there are only a few different basic steps.

Boy, was I wrong? I absolutely LOVE this DVD! It is MILES better than the old Walk Away. I really feel like I'm getting a good workout with this one. More like aerobic exercise than the Walk Away DVDs. And even better, Leslie isn't nearly as annoying with her incessant chatter.

If you have knee problems, though, you might not be able to do Mile 4. It has tons of lunges and I can't do them because of a bad knee I have.

I love how the miles count down, that way I knew I had done a 5 minute warm up (same as during the mile), and the full mile. She makes it so easy, even though you are really getting a great work out. She keeps you busy, it goes so fast, and it doesn't get boring. They are 14 minute miles, so one who is advanced and has a busy schedule can still get the whole thing done is 75 minutes. I can't wait until I become that advanced. I will definitely be getting further tapes from her. I noticed that she has a flat belly busting tape. (Or close to that title) ...

The people who are talking about wanting to get through the miles faster, are not talking about walking, they are talking about jogging. According to my treadmill, I do a 3 mile an hour mile in 20 min, and for me that is a fast walk at the height strut of 5'7"". At first I didn't think I was going to be able to keep up with this DVD however it was actually even easier because she has you doing different things and then back to a walk all during while still walking. The back to the walk makes it easier for one to get through the whole thing, rather then getting too tired and giving up. The reviews depend on one's fitness level, and not a put down on the DVD. I wish they would say so because this DVD is perfect for someone who wants a great walk with exercise thrown in there, but not so hard they end up putting the DVD away and give up ...",1369267200,4,1582,3.959247648902821
4648845,2,B005BX3NKK,"Very quickly - out of the 12 Leslie Sansone DVDs we own, this one was our least favorite and has found its way on the ""yard sale"" pile.
Music is uninspiring and very soft - it is hard to ""pick up the beat"".
The group was quite uninspiring as well. The larger group portions ( mile 1 and mile 5) feature a lot of missed steps and plastic smiles on a few faces and disinterest on some others. Her switching from one thing to another seem faster here than in other DVDs. I prefer concentrating on moves for a longer period of time before switching.
 Some of her workouts on this DVD (mile 3, mile 5) lean more to the ""dancey"" steps instead of the basic cardio steps featured in other DVDs so if you like that sort of movement, you might like this DVD.
The band workouts are OK, but overall these 5 miles did not work for me. I got better workouts from her other 5 mile workout DVDs.
Sorry to dis this one, but it just wasn't for me.",1368316800,7,929,4.104395604395604
4648846,1,B005BX3NKK,"I have about 10 of Leslie's videos, but I really don't like this one.  Leslie's older videos are all much slower and take a lot longer to get into. I thought this one would move faster.  There are several reasons I don't like this video.

1) The first mile is pretty slow and takes a long time to get into.  I only have time to do 30 minutes in the morning because I'm a mom of 3 and homeschool.  So, I need a quick paced 30 minute workout.
2) The stretchy band is bulky and too long.  I didn't feel like I got a good workout from the second mile.
3) I appreciate that usually the women in Leslie's videos are of all different sizes--they aren't in this one.
4) The exercises in this video are hard on my knees.  The combinations are harder to follow than her other videos as well.  I never have a problem with videos, but I do with this one.  I like her other fast videos, but they don't seem to be as hard on my knees.

If you're looking for a good workout that moves fast by Leslie, I'd check out these two instead:  Walk Slim: Fast and Firm 4 really big miles and Walk at Home 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk.  I love both of those.  They're faster paced than this one and I get a great work out.",1368144000,16,1192,4.0
4648847,4,B005BX3NKK,"Just getting to the point...

**Pros**

1) Leslie has a huge group of diverse people with her such as age, race, body type. Not everyone looks like the same like they always do in typical workout videos. So, in a way, it just helps you to relax and even relate more.

2) Her workouts are in this order (1)Warm up, (2)A normal step-mile, (3)Plastic band combined with steps, (4)another step-mile but faster, (5) goes back to the plastic band workout, (6)the final mile, (7) then warm up (8)and stretch. The plastic band workouts will make you a little gritty at the teeth. Leslie will make you work!!! Because you're dealing with the plastic band, it may be uncomfortable gripping at it. You might want to buy those exercise gloves, or whatever you call them.

3) The music is pretty nice. I am familiar with her other workout videos and have not come across any 'recycled' music. I know a lot of people get a little annoyed when she uses the same music over and over. But there were a handful of songs I liked a lot that made me forget I was working out because I was so busy listening.

4) There is a timer at the bottom right. It won't go away until the time is up. So, all through the workout, you know where you are.

5) DVD just goes straight to the menu without commercials or other hinder.

**Cons**

1) THREE of her songs did repeat throughout the entire DVD. I know ONE repeated three times from the warm up, to one of the miles, and then to the cool down. When you workout, you also want to be accompanied by some really good music of variety; music that helps you relax and even motivate you to put a little more effort in your moves. But there was one song I not only absolutely could not stand, but felt it just did not fit the workout. It was something like a remix of 'Putting love in your heart'. I think Leslie was just trying to promote love, but she's good at doing that on her own with her bubbly and perfect personality. The song was just unfit.

2) She catches you off guard SOMETIMES, but it's not that bad or hard at all to quickly catch up once you realize what she's doing. I would not let this be the reason you don't buy the DVD.

3) I could not help but notice this one guy with her that seemed as though he could not keep up with the moves and looked very uncomfortable or awkward to be there. I got this sensation that maybe he was dragged there by his wife when he really did not want to be a part of it. He was severely off step compared to the rest. Some conclusions I came up with are that;
he could just be slow
Very shy or nervous with the idea of cameras
His body was sore or handicapped
Isn't good at stuff like this and prefers other methods of working out

***********
As far as calories for this entire workout, I wore a pedometer on low sensing so it would not overly count my calorie burn. When I finished ALL 5 miles, I burned 496 calories. With the cool down, it was 510, and the stretch was 522. I got 10137 steps, and it counted 4_4 miles instead of 5, but I'm sure that's because of the arm toning band miles where you squat and do lunges. So, I can only imagine how much I'd burn if the pedometer was on Medium or High sensing. I am 159 pounds with a BMI 27. If you're around my size, you CAN do this.

Overall: I love it. Did the workout at least 3 to 4 times.",1367193600,4,3311,4.14820592823713
4648848,5,B005BX3NKK,"I have lost 90lbs doing several Leslie Sansone dvd's, within the pass year and a half. I went from 290lbs-200 lbs. Despite her talking too much and not quite on beat, this is a wonderful DVD for intermediate walkers. I love the music, and it really gets me pumped up. The strength training is very challenging, but not too strenuous. I did the dvd for a whole month alternating from four to five miles and resting one day out the week and I notice that my arms were starting to not flap so much and start to become a little more lean and firmer. My backend started to lift and become firm. The reason I love this particular DVD, because it's a all in one. From start to fish it's about an hour and a half, which is real good for calorie burn. BEWARE: I did gain weight the first two weeks (5lbs) but after a month I lost 10. I think it was because I started to gain muscle. I would not suggest this DVD if you are just starting out, unless you start with one mile and then buld yourself up. Also I found this copy Walmart, so check there first.",1366848000,4,1044,4.147783251231527

This five-mile workout is great in that one can choose to walk all five miles, which was a good challenge for me at first, or customize a workout with fewer miles and/or toning. Leslie uses the toning band (""stretchie"") in miles two and four; I definitely felt the effects of the mile four leg workout the next day!

I tend to do the warm up, then mile two, three, four or five.

Mile one has a song that gets stuck in my head all day.

Mile two and four use the resistance bands and I'm amazed by the results I can see and feel.

I have been doing this for 8 weeks and I feel SO much more toned.  Arms and legs.  I look and feel so much slimmer.",1366761600,,531,3.8425925925925926

I like the short bursts of faster pace activity that really bumps up the level of the workout for me.  Right now I'm unable to do the arm movements because of a cracked rib, but I still got a good workout.

4648858,1,B005BX3NKK,I own quite a few of Leslie Sansone DVD's but I stopped buying them because I can't stand her constant talking and when there are men in the group she really acts goofy.  I agree with a lot of other reviews that the moves are repetitive in all her DVD's.  I really enjoy the walking and wish she would read these reviews and stop all the useless chatting by the time I was done with a walk I wanted to throw something at the TV.  I have since moved on to using Stephanie Huckabee DVD's which I enjoy a lot more she is not a useless chatterbox and when I'm finished I don't feel like throwing something at the TV.,1361145600,4,612,4.083333333333333

4648860,5,B005BX3NKK,I like this workout because you can do the whole thing or mix up the miles to customize your workout.  The fourth mile is really tough - the work with the bands combined with the interval boosts makes for a killer mile.  I also like the third mile which is a fast 12 minute aerobic workout using no bands.  The second mile provides a good upper body workout with bands.  The first and fifth miles are classic walks - good but not too tough.  I would buy this dvd again!,1360713600,2,469,4.166666666666667

Thank you.",1360281600,3,318,3.953125
4648862,4,B005BX3NKK,"I agree with some of the negative reviews on this DVD, but I still like it and use it a lot.

It is repetitive, but the flip side of that is that the steps are easy to learn because you're doing them over and over (there are 4-5 basic steps and variations used throughout the workout). The benefit of all her workouts is that you can do them at home and get a great workout without the inconvenience and cost of a gym.

This DVD is a huge improvement over her older ones that looked very old-fashioned and stale. The look is fresher and the feel more upbeat. The music is not current top-40 (""I Say a Little Prayer"", ""Doctor, Doctor"", ""Put a Little Love in Your Heart"" are some songs that are used), but it serves the purpose. She does recycle music a lot (in all her videos) and that gets tedious if you're doing them frequently.

Still, for the price and results, I'd recommend this to anyone, especially anyone about 35 and over who needs some exercise. It's effective, time-efficient, and about as enjoyable as any indoor exercise can be.",1360195200,,1042,4.416666666666667

4648864,5,B005BX3NKK,"I also own several Leslie DVDs.  In this newer one, the moves are changed up a little more than the older ones.  If you have never tried a Walk at Home video, this might not be the best one to start with.

Here's what I like about 5 Really Big Miles:

*Sunny, bright studio.

*Not all the people are super-buff.  (Watching super-fit people can make a person feel even worse about her own self-image.)

*You can pick and choose what you feel like doing.  I tell myself I can get up and just do one mile, and once I start, it's easier to keep going. Some say it's choppy; I say it breaks up the monotony and makes the time go faster! To me, if the whole thing was one big workout, it would seem daunting.

*The stretchy band you get really does provide resistance for muscle tone.

*The music is catchy.

*If you keep up with it (a few times a week) you WILL start to feel stronger!  As an example, I noticed that going up stairs was easier.

*All of the Leslie DVDs can help you FEEL better.  If you feel down-in-the-dumps, pop in a DVD and try a mile or two.",1359417600,,1058,4.122549019607843

I love her workouts for days when I don't want to think to hard. The 1 1/2 hours flys by when you do all 5 miles!!!! I tend to like the Dvd's with the most miles so I can really get a long walk in.

I realize she is probably trying to appeal to a younger audience and that is probably smart, but I feel that she loses the appeal to the rest of us who aren't perfect looking, and she doesn't have a broad range of ages in the group. I just relate more to a ""mixed"" group!  Other than that it was great. Another good thing was that she brought some different and higher energy steps.

It kicked butt!!  While 4 fast miles focused a lot on lower body and abdominal work, 5 really big mixes it all up and includes A LOT more upper body.  My entire body felt spent after this one and I cannot wait to see how clothes fit in a week or so.  Highly recommend.  You do have to set aside over an hour for this to complete all 5 miles.

This workout has fresh moves, new music, and a new younger cast. This workout is much much more intense then most of older ones, not just because its 5 miles, plus warm up and cool down. it has a great ""boosted"" section, and lots of muscle work with the bands. It is also formatted so you can easily choose which miles you want to do.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to bump up their at home walks.  I don't think this would be a good starting video, you can modify all the walk at home workouts, but this one is more complicated with the new moves.

  This workout is fun, HARD (do the second, third,or fourth mile and you will know what I'm talking about, lol!),and fast paced. Also it has fresh music, fresh faces, and it may be the best Leslie Sansone workout I have ever done, but it is always do-able, which is what Leslie is all about.
  The ONLY PROBLEM I have with this workout, are the two girls she has as part of the cast, who do most of the workout with her. Their outfits leave a lot to be desired, literally! The camera is always focusing on their bare midriffs, which is really annoying and offensive. I have always admired LS and her videos for showing REAL people,actually WEARING clothes, doing REALLY hard moves/workouts. So, workout outfits aside, this is a really superior workout. Exceptional, in fact. Thank you for reading.",1349222400,,958,4.457142857142857
4648881,5,B005BX3NKK,"I felt that I had to write this review because a few of the negative reviews that I read almost turned me away from purchasing this. I am so glad that I did! I really enjoy the format of this DVD. I have done it twice, through from start to finish, but in the back of my mind I'm already thinking of how I can mix it up to create shorter workouts. I could choose to do the warm-up, then miles 1,3 and 5 that don't use the resistance band followed by the cool-down and stretch or just the opposite and use the 2nd and 4th miles to really get an intense muscle workout. I must respectfully disagree that the pauses between miles are too long. Holy cow, I barely have time to throw down the resistance band (or grab it up) and take a swallow or two of water before we're off again. I think the spacing is just perfect.

I also like that each mile has a different number of walkers. I appreciate the inclusion of a couple of more curvy ladies in this workout - they look like me!  At the same time, if you're super-fit and spunky you'll have your work cut out for you keeping up with a couple of these ladies.

I will admit that the fifth mile degenerates into a sort of free-for-all, but Leslie does introduce it as ""The Wild Mile""! And as she states - it's the pace that's important and that helps you reach the mile marks. So what if you're taking 4 steps up and back and she's doing 3...just have fun and move! There are lots of new moves and combinations and Leslie mixes it up so I not only never get bored, I have to really watch and listen to keep up with the constant changes. I don't find my mind wandering and going on autopilot as happens when I do some of the other workouts. This is easily my favorite Leslie Sansone workout that I own so far (I have 5 others).",1348099200,15,1771,4.11271676300578
4648882,5,B005BX3NKK,"I own several of Leslie's walking workouts, and this one is a favorite!  Unlike some of the reviewers, I love being able to customize which miles I walk rather than one long workout.  If I'm pressed for time, I like Mile 3 and Mile 5 with the warm up and cool down.  I'm in my early 40s, I'm trying to get into better shape (besides the ROUND shape I am now), and have no trouble keeping up with the pace of the workouts.

Leslie is with a group of walkers on this DVD, and the room they're in is bright and cheery.  I enjoy seeing different shapes and sizes of walkers rather than Leslie on her own.  I wish all of the DVDs would come with a music only option for days when you'd rather just walk without the chatter, but it's easy to mute and use your own mp3 player instead.  However, the music on this DVD really is great!  Love the 12 minute mile ""power walking"" also.

In short, you will sweat.  You will find muscle groups you didn't realize you had.  You might even feel better (I certainly do), even if you're sore for a day or so afterwards.  The miles go by very quickly on this DVD, and even though I generally hate to exercise, I find myself looking forward to working out with Leslie and the group.  Life is too short to spend it in front of the computer or tv, and the encouragement from Leslie to keep walking helps me stay motivated.  Thank you, Leslie!",1346716800,5,1370,4.199233716475096
4648883,3,B005BX3NKK,"Leslie Sansone was recommended to me by a fitness trainer, and I picked this up knowing nothing about her dvds other than the fact that they used only 4 steps. Being very uncoordinated- and I mean bad!- this appealed to me. I need easy...no fancy steps or coordinated movements, please. Tried the 2 mile walk and here's a few thoughts.

This is not bad. The steps are basically forward, backwards, and side to side. Leslie throws in kicks, 'grapevine,' knee lifts, double steps, and a sort of cha-cha thing along the way. Being coordinately-challenged (a klutz) I did my best, but found the pace too fast for learning new steps. Leslie does go over some of them slowly in the beginning, but not so much when the pace picks up. Those who are used to them will not have a problem, but if you are a beginner or like me, it will be easier, at least in the beginning, to just ignore the fancy stuff and keep to the basics. You'll still be moving and working, so that is not a problem. There's no jumping involved in the first 2 miles. (And, if there is in other parts of the workout, you can just walk, sidestep, or whatever.)

Mile 2 used the band. I cannot say I got much out of the band, but waving my arms about, pulling at the band, did not hurt anything and may have used a few more calories.

There are reminders about keeping your tummy tucked in, so that's good, but there's not a great deal of directions about body positioning during the exercise. There is a countdown clock which I liked. Counting down, to me, is always easier than up. There are several ladies in the background  and a few appear to be beginners, so not all of them are skinny girls who look like they live in a gym. After each mile, Leslie congratulates everyone and a screen pops up announcing the next mile. One mile slides pretty easily into the other. The music was not that great, but the beat did match the increasing pace.

When it started, I was really surprised at the poor video quality. It looked like a bad copy of a VHS tape. But, I must admit that once I got started, I didn't pay attention to that anymore and was just concentrating on following along. Perhaps this is an old series?

For those needing variety, I think this will get old very fast. For those needing an easy, basically uncomplicated and low impact workout to do in their home, this is not a bad choice.

Walking has always been my favorite, and most effective way to shed pounds because it's easily modified for ability.  Leslie Sansone uses this basic idea to keep walking engaging, entertaining, and very effective.  (If you stick with it, walking does reduce weight and inches!)

I really loved this mile the most out of the five because it challenges you with a series of repeated squats and lunges, which, I agree with Leslie, are probably the best exercises for your legs (quadriceps and hamstrings) and derriere. In both this mile and in MILE 2 the toning band, or what Leslie has historically called the ""stretchie"", are used a great deal.

I agree with at least one previous reviewer that for cardio this may not be the BEST of Leslie's Sansone's DVD's. The pace at least SEEMS slower. I missed the ""boosted walking"" of the previously mentioned DVD's.  Strength training, however, especially to those of us over 50 is as much, if not even more, important than cardiovascular exercise. Women especially start to lose muscle mass after menopause.

In the end I would recommend this tape be used as an alternative to other DVD's Leslie has put out alternating it with the faster, more rapidly paced tapes. You are supposed to vary your exercise routine anyway so that your body doesn't ""get used to"" a routine and then, not being challenged enough, does not show improvement.",1341100800,,1805,5.8816793893129775
4648898,5,B005BX3NKK,"I will admit, I bought this DVD for my mother with no intention of using it for myself. I thought of Leslie's videos as videos for old people. Well, last night I was bored with my usual killer workout programs (Insanity, P90x) and wanted to take it easy and give it a try. I burned 500 calories doing 3 miles! I was shocked! I wasn't panting, or gasping like I am with my other programs but I was visbly exherting myself. I think this DVD does a great job of adding challenges for the exerciser that can do more high impact. Leslie incorporates some interval training and ""boosted walking"" which is basically jogging in place. She also adds some new moves like ""shifting"" where you shift your weight from one foot to the other. Pretty dancy and pretty fun! The strength training with the bands is excellent as well. Really targets the problem areas. Great video!",1340236800,4,862,4.532051282051282
4648899,5,B005BX3NKK,I have just recently started doing Leslie Sansone DVD's after many years of being a regular exerciser.  I guess I thought a walk wouldn't be that challenging. I was wrong!  Wow-  I loved this DVD.  It was fun- the time passed quickly and best of all I felt like I had really done a great workout!  I liked her music as it was different from her other DVD's.  On a couple of her others the music seems the same- which can be kind of boring to me.  I like that she's adding boosts to her walking- I need that to get my heart rate up.

I was hesitant to purchase this one because I thought it might not be challenging enough.  Boy was I wrong!  I could barely manage to get past the first two miles.  There are a few things that I like about this one; Leslie has some new moves and she also combines her moves.  I also like the fact that the counter stays on the screeen so you can figure out where you are in the workout.

4648901,3,B005BX3NKK,"So my weight and level of fitness has fluctuated a lot over the years.  Back in 2002, I was an overweight 19-year-old and decided to start working out.  I got ""Walk Away the Pounds"" on VHS and found it was a helpful way to ease into an exercise routine.  I ended up outgrowing it and it wasn't challenging enough for me, but I always considered Leslie's programs to be decent workouts for beginners.  I'm now 29, and finding myself overweight again, out of shape, and wanting to feel better.  I impulsively bought this DVD at a grocery store in my neighborhood.  It took me weeks to motivate myself to actively begin an exercise regime again, but I remembered how ""Walk Away the Pounds"" helped me ease into a workout routine, so I decided to start, I will add this video into my routine.

OK, so Leslie Sansone is a little annoying for me.  She's perky and tries to make cute little jokes and tells cute little, personal anecdotes about the ""walkers"" she's walking with.  To me, it's pretty cheesy and annoying.  I imagine once I have the routine more or less memorized, I'm going to mute the sound.  I'm just not that cutesy-patootsy type.  I find it to be fake and saccharine.  I prefer hosts that are focused on the workout itself and aren't too cheesy.  It's hard to find, though. :-P

On the workout itself, it's decent and it will make your heartrate go up and make you sweat.  I will say that if you are an absolute beginner, or you've been sedentary and away from vigorous exercise for a long time (like me), or if you have problems with your lower back and knees, I'd approach the 4th mile carefully.  This DVD comes with a resistance band.  In the 4th mile, she does a lot of ""lunges"" with the resistance band.

My legs are muscular and well-toned despite my upper body being flabby and out of shape because I work in a kitchen and walk to and from work every day, so I didn't feel the need to do lunges and the like.  She also has a lot of bouncing around and jogging in this mile.  For myself, I skip this mile and repeat mile 3 twice instead of doing mile 4, because at present I'm having a lot of foot pain issues and don't wish to screw up my feet with all the jumping and bouncing.  I can handle the steps in the usual miles with minimal pain, but I knew if I were to bounce around and jog in place like she instructed, my feet would be killing me later (and I have to stand on them 35 hours a week at work).  Mile 3 is fast-paced cardio, which is what I wanted from this video.  Strength training is great, don't get me wrong, and I see the merits in it, but when I did try to do mile 4, my body was confused because she slowed the pace greatly and started alternating all these lunges with the band with the bouncy jogging stuff.  I have a set of resistance bands my parents gifted me a few years ago, and a DVD with a strength training workout using those bands, which I plan to work into my routine once I get used to doing cardio regularly.  I wish this DVD would focus mostly on cardio.  The 2nd mile incorporated the bands too, but she didn't slow the pace so much and I was able to keep my heartrate up.  It also focused on the upper-body which is what I need.

There was one error I noticed as well.  In mile 2, I believe, she says something about doing a step she showed us in mile 1.  Said step was never demonstrated in mile 1.  Oops! :-P  But honestly, if you have half a brain, you can pick up the step, it's not too hard.  If you're a bit on the larger side right now, some of the steps require more agility than you may have.  I think if you modify them and keep up the pace, it's just as effective.  There are times when I move my arms when the host doesn't tell you to, simply because I can handle it and it's not as challenging for me to leave my arms dangling while my legs move.  Also, the stretch after the cool-down is incomplete, in my opinion.  Since I've worked out before, I do my own stretches after doing this workout and I don't do hers.  I do the standard set of stretches they used to have us do in gym class when I was a kid, and it works out for me and gives a more complete stretch. :)  Also, sometimes instead of her cool-down, if it's nice outside, I just go out and walk laps around my apartment complex instead. It does essentially the same thing and I don't have to listen to Leslie talk any more. :-P

So yeah, all in all it's OK and decent.  I gave it 3 stars mostly because I didn't like how in the 4th mile she attempted to make it like a ""boot camp"" or whatever, but the heartrate goes down so you lose your mojo for a little bit (which is why I just decided to repeat the 12-minute, fast-paced mile twice to keep my heartrate up), and I don't like the cutesy-patootsy, fakey demeanor of the host.  It's cheesy.  Other than that, it's a good workout to start with if you want to work out at home, and if you've been away from exercise for awhile.  Leslie's workouts are usually decent, but not out of a beginner's reach.  I know she has a lot of DVDs and I might try more of hers later.  If you like cutesy anecdotes and stuff like that, you might really like her hosting style.  I personally think it's annoying, so once steps are memorized, the sound goes off. :-P",1338681600,,5227,4.174825174825175

I gravitate to dance workouts like hip hop, latin, burlesque, etc., but I noticed a few pounds creeping on over the past 6 months, and the only difference in my routine was that my much loved golden retreiver died - so I wasn't walking as much - okay, hardly at all! Since I didn't want to walk outside late at night alone (not smart even in the best neighborhoods!), and my doctor is always extolling the virtues of walking since I pretty much ruined my knees by running, I ordered this DVD. Dull, dull, dull! I had played a clip before ordering, and I really liked the music - unfortunately, I can't hear it! Now, Amazon is sending me another copy, so it could be a defect...we'll see. It could also be that Leslie feels the need to talk too much and too loudly! There is no feature on the menu to set up the audio. Actually, the menu is set in stone, you cannot pick and chose what miles you wish to do and program them - this is a feature I'm used to in all my other multi chapter DVDs. The 5 mile walk with cool down (which, as another reviewer wrote, is the same as the last 3 minutes of mile 5 - skip it!)and stretch (which is another waste of time - do your own),is an exercise in futility. So, the entire DVD took almost an hour and a half out of my life that I'll never get back! I suspected that a walking workout would not be very exciting, but I did not expect it to be so boring and repetitious - I kept looking out my window and completely losing my place! Also, I did not even begin to break a mild sweat until the middle of Mile 5 - I usually feel the sweat coming on after about 10 minutes with my dance workouts. I think what bothered me most, was Leslie's ""chit chat session"" with her cast during the cool down. She extols the virtues of long, blissful, marriages ad nauseam. As a happily single woman, with no intention of marrying (I like to date and retain sole possession of my remote control!), I found myself wanting to tell her to just shut up and join the 21st century! I'm writing this the day after my ""5 Really Big Miles,"" and the only muscles I can feel that I worked are my calves, and believe me, they are muscular enough already, I don't need that area worked! I'll try this DVD again after I receive the new one from Amazon, and hope that the music will be better and let me tune out her endless chatter.

I love the variety of people she involves, and while some might find her talking and mingling with the other walkers distracting, I find it helps me take my mind off the fact that I'm actually working out, and makes me feel like I'm just hanging out with Leslie and her friends.

4648908,5,B005BX3NKK,"Leslie Sansone: 5 Really Big Miles DVD is a great workout. I have several of Leslie Sansone DVD's and this one is the best so far. The work out is fast and keeps you moving to the beat. The moves are very simple and easy to follow. I love to walk, but my neighborhood does not have a safe place to walk so this DVD is a perfect way for me to walk away the pounds. It gives me a good workout. The best part is that I can choose how many miles to do. The DVD comes with a firm band that Leslie shows how to walk and use the band for upper body strength training. My TOPS group uses her DVD's as prizes to the biggest loser in our group.",1333324800,,634,3.8106060606060606

The toning belt adds a nice touch to the workouts to get the upper body toned as well. The other nice part of this DVD is that each mile has its own section so that you can do 1 mile, 2, 3, 4, or all 5. One downfall and the reason for only 4 stars and not 5 is that the moves can be repetitive. This is my go to workout for days when I am not as energetic!

I have tried many other workouts but being over 40 and overweight, I keep coming back to Walk Away The Pounds videos as they are constructed in a fashion for anyone to follow. When I want a challenge, I simply add weights. I am soooooo very happy she has ""shaked it up"" with quite a nice variety of movements and BEST of all the MUSIC. If only trainers would realize what the MUSIC does to people who are following their steps. I find myself singing the songs and not realizing how many times I've kicked (with ankle weights on). I am doing the full 5 miles every other day, just because I am enjoying the MUSIC. I reeeeeeally hope she puts out more videos with good music because we all know we need to switch things up and right now, there's not another video (that I know of) in her collection that is so inspiring. Again it's because of the MUSIC.....Leslie, I hope you are reading this....THE MUSIC GIRLFRIEND, THE MUSIC.....it gets us BUMPING  :) Love U....and thank you!! BTW...I have only been using this for about 3 weeks and yes, I can already see body changes :) and that is inspiring me to want more.",1333065600,2,1153,4.413145539906103
4648911,5,B005BX3NKK,"I have most of Leslie's DVD's from the past several years.  Have to say this one is a new approach from her usual...For one thing, you have 5 serious miles, effective usage of the stretchy band, and just the right mix of moves, including a few ""boosted minutes"".  I finished this DVD feeling like I had really done something productive with my time.  Hope to see more like this one in the future, Leslie!!!",1332547200,,406,4.45945945945946
4648912,5,B005BX3NKK,"I love Leslie Sansone's workouts, and have ever since I discovered her.  As someone with fibromyalgia, her workouts were gentle enough for me to break back into exercise.  But, honestly, the videos all started to look the same, always with the same old moves.  Now, I can vary them on my own, but I'd rather do something different along with her.  If I wanted to make up my own routine, why would I bother buying a video?!  I also was not fond of the workouts that were Leslie only.  I like her, but what I really love is the interaction between her and others.  And it also gives you new people to look at and focus on, which makes it easier to do the same routine over and over.

That said, this video is, in my humble opinion, the best workout Leslie has put out to date.  There are plenty of new moves, some that have been in later workouts, and even some combinations (such as kickbacks/sidesteps), along with the four basic steps.  The music is different, though ""New Attitude"" did make its appearance!  I personally very much like the miles being broken up, because that allows me to pick and choose which miles I want to do, and I can get to the menu and choose them easily.  Even the cooldown and stretch are separate, so you can stop whenever you'd like and not have to search for the cooldown.

My one complaint with the DVD is that the 5th mile has a very long section of what really is cooldown, although it's not considered to be cooldown.  By the time you get to the end of the 5th mile, your heart rate is completely back to normal, and you're just ready for a stretch.  I would have liked to see the 5th mile end with a little bit brisker pace.

All in all, this is my favorite workout and is one I will do over and over because it is so versatile, being able to pick and choose the miles and form different workout routines.  Thank you, Leslie, for listening to your fans and giving us what we asked for!",1332115200,2,1922,4.265193370165746

Leslie is very focused on the exercise in this and so there is less chit-chat.  Since I do this exercise daily, I like that.  After hearing the chit-chat 20 times or more, it gets old.  I like having a timer on each mile so I know how long till I'm done.  When I do all 5 miles, I really feel like I've done a good hard workout.

You can customize to fit your pace/needs. I personally enjoy the first three (3) miles. I also love this DVD because it doesn't require floor/mat work and YOU REALLY DO SEE RESULTS.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the bright set, fresh faces and best of all, several new moves!

Now though I am VERY frustrated in not receiving the 'included' band, I decided to try the video once before returning it the second time...I thought I might as well see if I even like it before buying it again...I liked it.  A lot!  I am not a huge Leslie fan.  I do have several of her DVDs but her jabber really begins to get on my nerves after a while.  Also, I get really bored doing the same moves over and over and over an over.  Well, this video does have the same classic Leslie moves, and you will do them over and over, but it also contains new moves, squats, lunges, oh my! I love it. Also her jabber was not annoying! Yay! I actually enjoyed her very much.  So, all that to say, BEWARE...you may not receive a NEW unopened DVD with the band...but if you do get it, I think you'll like it. =)

Oh, and I actually didn't find the transition in miles bothersome at all???  I just kept my walking fast as we began each new segment.  It was fine.  If you are needing something faster or harder, you probably should be using something more advanced than the Walk at Home DVDs. I also like that I can pick a mile of choice to do.

4648934,4,B005BX3NKK,"Hoooray for new moves!  I'm really glad that Leslie has come up with a few new variations to her moves.  I love doing her walks but I found myself getting bored with the same old thing.  There is some new music in here too, and except for mile 1, the workout seems to just fly by!  Leslie seems pretty focused throughout most of her dvd, which I greatly appreciate.  I normally love her chattering on while we workout since it makes the time go by and even makes me smile even when I've heard it for the 50th time, but as anyone who is a fan of Leslie can understand, there are times when I've been kicking (or side stepping) for what seems like forever because she gets SO caught up in talking....that I just want her to shut up and do her job.  Personally I prefer her either by herself (because she is essentially chattering to the cameramen) or with no more than 4 people.  More than that seems to get her overly distracted.  I also love the stretchie band miles!  Almost every dvd of hers that I have where she incorporates some kind of gadget or prop (weights, belts, bands, whatever) makes the miles go by faster for me.  In this dvd I felt like I got a really good workout for my upper back in mile 2 and it's unusual to find a video that payes enough attention to the back muscles.

Some people noted that they didn't like the breaks between the miles.  I understand that it was done so you can start anywhere in the video (rather than starting with mile 1 all of the time).  I agree that it would have been nice if the pace didn't slow down quite so much at the beginning of each new mile.

There are some major flaws in this dvd,however.  It was obviously not filmed in order, and in mile 2 she queues a new move that ""we saw in the last mile"", however ""we"" did NOT do this move before.  But apparently in the filming they had.  There are also some issues with the sound.  I found myself having to turn up the volume or I couldn't hear the music at all.  There are also some times where you are doing side-steps with claps and the sound of the claps is WAAAY off from the hand movements.  I'm not sure why this is, but it throws me off.  I think there could have been some better editing done there.

I plan to use this dvd for miles 2-4 mostly.  Mile 1 is just SO slow I want to give up before it's even over.  I would love to see a DVD that has these new moves with faster walking.  Doing this DVD from beginning (including warm-up and cooldown & stretch) just takes too long (I think it was an hour and 20 minutes or a bit more).  People who are looking for a 5 mile dvd are probably people who have been walking with Leslie for a while and want something a good bit more up-paced than this.",1327449600,8,2705,4.134099616858237

The four mile section has you do lunges using the stretch band that comes with the DVD. Great workout. I did the 5 mile last Saturday and loved it! Leslie gives clear instructions on this DVD unlike the walk away tapes where she was prone to talk away forgetting to keep up with reps. Not so on this workout!

Some miles are toning miles using an included band, others are typical Leslie walking workouts.  She has a nice variety of walkers--some bigger girls and one man (I think...might be two).

This would work for anybody from a beginner to an intermediate exerciser.  I think it's ideal for an advanced beginner.

I love how airy it feels and I love the participants in the dvd too.  It's a more comfortable environment.  Plus the exercises were right on target.  My body is still sore as I'm writing this, but that's probably because I did the whole 5 miles. :)

Now for the bad news...  The dvd lies when it says it's 75 mins in total. It's not. It's 78 mins not including the cooldown & stretch.  The total dvd (warmup, miles 1-5, cool down, and stretch) is actually 87.5 minutes.  This kind of messed me up, because I do my workout before work and I timed my alarm to allow for 75 mins of WATP and since I couldn't just stop the workout I was 12 minutes behind schedule.

I recently purchased this dvd because I needed to bump up my workout and get a little more of a challenge. Boy is this it! If you do all 5 miles in this dvd, you are getting a heck of a workout! Mile 1 is a basic mile but fast paced, Mile 2 is an upper body workout with the toning band, Mile 3 is a very fast paced calorie burning walk, Mile 4 is an upper and lower body workout with the toning band again and Mile 5 is a moderate paced mile that slows down a bit toward the end in preparation of cooling down. I'm telling you, Mile 4 really works those thighs and rear! The day after I did this workout, my legs, thighs and rear were so sore, I could hardly sit down, which is exactly what I was looking for!

The cool down is not a separate chapter so you have to fast forward.  The music was ok.  I love 80's music and it didn't bother me.

4648971,5,B005BX3NKK,"This was a really great video - I have another of Leslie's exercise videos, and have lost 26 pounds over the last few months, just using that one and alternating with another video that has mostly strength training.  However, I was getting kind of tired of doing the same thing each week, so I thought I'd get another.  This one is really great - gives you the option of doing any one or more of the 5 different miles, and then separately doing the cool-down and stretch.  It is harder than the other Leslie video I own, so between the two, I feel like I really have options for my week, depending on how much time I have and how much work out I feel like I need that day.  The music is definitely better on this one - don't be expecting any rock-n-roll or anything - but it does fit the workout and gives you something to listen to while you are exercising.",1325030400,2,858,4.213414634146342
4648972,3,B005BX3NKK,"I do not care for this video very much. The music sounds terrible, which might be a good thing because these songs were hits back in the eighties.

4648973,5,B005BX3NKK,"I feared that fun workouts were a thing of the past.  Not so!  This ""walk at home"" program is actually low impact aerobics set to great music and paced with miles instead of minutes.  The moves remind me of aerobics classes from the 80s to mid-90s, but they are extremely simple.  No fancy steps here.  Just a solid workout that you can gear to your own fitness level.  There are so many steps in a mile depending on the beats per minute.  The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th miles go by very quickly as the pace picks up, and it's amazingly motivating to reach those mile points.  The band that's included with the DVD is a great addition to the workout as it provides a means for a good upper and lower body workout.  This is my first Leslie Sanson Walk at Home DVD, but it will certainly not be my last!",1324857600,5,792,4.19205298013245

I have a lot of musculo-skeletal problems and always have some injury, but she's kept me moving.  If there's something too painful, I substitute another move.  I'm 63 and 75 pounds overweight, but I keep moving.  To save time, I usually skip the warm-up and do just the 1st, 3rd and 5th mile, and feel great afterwards.  And yes, I know the sound isn't quite right in the 1st mile, nor is Dion Warwick singing, but I love it anyway!",1324771200,,558,4.378640776699029
4648975,5,B005BX3NKK,"Leslie Sansone's ""Five Really Big Miles"" is new in 2011. If you are a veteran walker, you will be happy to discover new music, new combination moves, and an all-new cast.

The backdrop of this workout is a white-painted studio. There is abstract art done in whites and blues, reminding you strongly of water. To intensify the ""thirst"" effect, there is a shelf full of bottled water. It reminded me to drink while I was working out. While this takes place in a studio, the windows and doors have been papered white over the glass, so you do get distracted by what's going on outside, as we did in past DVDs. There are no posters or slogans or expressions hanging on the wall. It is simple, white, and modern.

There are five, mile-long segments. In Mile One, you walk low-impact at an easy, light pace. An example of the music from this mile is ""Say A Little Prayer For You."" There are many walkers of many shapes and sizes in this mile. Leslie introduces new moves, like the double side step and four beat combinations of old moves. She even brings back the Cha-Cha from the 1980's, calling it ""Fast Feet"" by performing it on her toes, like a ""little run.""

Miles Two and Four are strength training miles, using the Stretchie Band (included with the DVD). In Mile Two, you do all upper body work with the Band. In Mile Four, you use the Band to do squats and lunges. The strength training work is done in intervals. In Mile Four, you do two high-impact intervals of ""Boosted Walking"" (Jogging) and a new move, the high-impact grapevine. You will break a sweat, and you will feel this the next day. While doing the walking-jogging intervals, you tie the Stretchie around your waist.

Mile Three is the fastest mile in terms of pace. The new move you will find in this mile is ""shifts."" Shifts are really a boxer's bounce from toe to toe, side to side. You add punches to the front, and later overhead to intensify the move. This mile ends with a short ""boosted"" interval, 60 seconds of jogging.

Mile Five is the ""Facebook"" mile. She has one walker sitting off the the side with a laptop, reading Facebook posts, and Leslie even announces one of the posts. This is largely a cool-down mile as the pace and intensity slows. There is a Cool Down segment included, but this segment is not very useful physically. There is no stretching, and it is simply an aerobic cool down. If you are fit, you probably cooled down in Mile Five. During the Cool Down segment, Leslie introduces some of the walkers, talks about wedding anniversaries of two couples walking with her, and the importance of family (her brother and sister in law are part of the group).

This is a long, fun workout for days you want to do more than just aerobic activity. If you are an outdoor walker or runner, this will add variety as well as some light strength work. The only major muscle group missing from the strength work was Abs (or core). I wished there were some crunches or sit-ups thrown into the mix somewhere just to round it out better. I would have also appreciated a good stretch at the end.",1324425600,21,3070,4.492831541218638
4648976,5,B005BX3NKK,"For me, this is the best Leslie Sansone DVD yet.  I love it!  It has some combo steps and exercising with the stretchie band (included) and it's motivating and interesting.  Of course you can still do everything at your own pace but the new steps are fun and I like walking to songs that I recognize.",1324252800,,300,4.321428571428571
4648977,5,B005BX3NKK,"This DVD is my favorite one from the Sansone walk-at-home series.
I own four of her DVDs and tried most of the others.  This DVD is refreshing and vigorous.  Leslie has new floor partners (she calls them 'cast')and erercise moves not seen before.  The different moves are not new -- have seen from other instructors, but Leslie introduces them here to break up the monopoly of the 4 basic moves as she had before; she is trying harder with more thoughts put in editing to make exercise interesting.  Mile 1: regular pace. Mile 2: walk and strength training with a stretch band.  Mile 3: fast pace.  Mile 4: more fast walking and stretch band.  Mile 5: slow pace.  The DVD starts with a warm-up session and ends with a cool-down session, all selectable from the remote control to give a more flexible exercise option-selection and duration.  As usual, a final separate session of stretching.  Leslie is as perky and talkative as before.
The music is upbeat.  A nice exercise DVD to own and keep.",1324166400,,994,4.655172413793103
4648978,2,B005BX3NKK,"i am a huge Leslie fan and was excited to get this latest DVD which had great reviews but i am not as impressed with it as i thought i would be. the music is muffled and i wouldn't consider it ""hit music"". she has a variety of people on the video working out with her but the two she seems to be seen with the most are two extremely thin and gorgeous girls. this personally discourages me because no matter how many Leslie videos i do, i'll never look like that, so why even try. at least i got a workout band... but don't get me wrong it is definitely a workout, just not one i'll want to keep doing.",1323820800,11,601,3.975206611570248
4648979,5,B005BX3NKK,"I've almost all of Leslie's DVD's, and all have been wonderful through the years. She has been instrumental in assisting me to stay motivated, and losing over 80 pounds. That being said--- this is without a doubt, Leslie's best dvd to date. She's added some new steps, new music, and every other mile is walking with strength training--which we all know keeps the metabolism up, up, up..for hours. If you are new at exercising-- this dvd might be a bit much for you. Seasoned walkers will enjoy the added changes...and the very fast pace. Take this one as a real challenge....and pace yourself....you will need to do so, to get through the whole thing---but the rewards are worth the time. This dvd is a MUST for all walkers...and fans of Leslie.",1321660800,3,746,4.702290076335878
4648980,5,B005BX3NKK,I own two of Leslies dvd's so far. The slim down 5 miles and this one. I enjoy them both because I can do as few or as many miles as I want depending on how much time I have. I like to alternate Leslie's workouts with walking on the treadmill when the weather is bad and I can't walk outside. This is a great alternative to the gym for me because I can do this with little kids around. This DVD also offers some toning exercises. This is low impact but I definitely work up a sweat with this one while preserving my joints for the future.,1321488000,2,538,3.990740740740741

4648994,5,B005BX3NKK,"I was introduced to Leslie Sansome's work-out DVD's last fall.  After being addicted to three of them throughout the fall and winter I took the summer off and enjoyed out of doors exercise.  Starting up again this September, I just couldn't get back into doing the same kicks, side-steps, etc.  I ordered this DVD and I am once again addicted.  I love the new steps, especially the shift, and the change-ups and combinations of the old steps. After doing 5 miles, I am really sweating and feel that I have had an excellent total body work-out and especially the mid-section which is where I need it.  I wouldn't recommend this for someone just starting out unless you are in really good physical shape.",1320624000,6,702,4.67479674796748
4648995,2,B005BX3NKK,"I was so anxious for this thing to be released and now that it has been and I've tried it 3 times, I don't know where to start. She gets 2 stars only because she is walking on the video like it says so....

Let's start with the music. I know the cover says ""hit music"" but...um...no. The music that was played may have been a ""hit"" when my mother was a teen (Say A Little Prayer by Dionne Warwick) and when I was a little kid (New Attitude by Patti LaBelle). I guess technically that wasn't a lie but Leslie has to realize that in 2011, if you say ""hit music"" people are going to be expecting something from the current era not something that requires a mental time machine. Even some upbeat techno from the 90's would have been better.

Secondly, the cast. Call me picky but many of them (unfortunately the ones the camera decided to focus on the most)are sloppy in their movement and/or lack rhythm. Yeah, I know Leslie says you can't do the workout wrong but if you are putting on a professional production, at least use people who know how to use their body. Even the two sports bra women lacked precision.

The miles with the stretch band were useless. They were total heart rate lowerers. I don't normally even mess with the stretch band but I wanted to give an honest review. She totally could have kept the stretch band out of the whole video; especially since it's so slow.

The fourth problem I had with this video is the level of over-the-topness. In mile 3, she has them doing mambo cha-cha combinations. Leslie refers to this as ""fast feet."" Really, Leslie? You are a professional. Then, she brings up ""fast feet"" in the second mile which lets me know that the order that the final edit is in was not the original order.

I won't even talk about the last mile where one of the walkers is sitting in a chair off to the side on a laptop looking at a social networking site and the anniversary announcements.

All in all, this video was like watching paint dry. I think what really killed it were the stretch band segments. Had she just done a pure walking video and then added ""strength"" training in a separate section, that MIGHT have saved this project.",1320192000,15,2166,4.389027431421447
4648996,5,B005BX3NKK,"I have almost all of Leslies Sansone's walking videos and while I love her program, I have to admit that it does get a little boring when you do it every day. I am certainly not a fitness expert, but as a stay at home mom, it is difficult for me to get out and go to the gym, so Walk at Home has been a great choice for me.
In this DVD, there are 5 miles. The DVD has all the things I love about Leslie, her cheerful enthusiasm, her encouragement and the reassurance that you can modify the walk to work for you. Each mile is slightly different and has a different group of people walking with Leslie. Leslie has added some new moves that we have not seen in the other DVDs and FINALLY some new music! The new moves were easy to master and did not require a significant amount of coordination (for which I am thankful.) This walk also includes the basic walking steps that we are used to: walking in place, kicks, leg lifts, side steps, kick backs, tap out, etc. There is also some strength training with the stretch band, as well as intervals and of course ""boosted walking"" aka jogging. I personally really enjoyed this walk and found it challenging, but I was able to keep up.

I have had this DVD for three weeks now, I've done it twice a week, and the toning in my arms and the flattening of my stomach is very evident to me.

I love how this video is organized in ""segments"".  The first mile is a great fast-paced mile, the second mile is focused on the upper body toning (with the stretchy band) as well as incrasing the pace, the third mile is a walk/jog mile, the fourth (my favorite) is a bootcamp mile with intervals of jogging and strength training, and the fifth mile is basically bringing the body back down to a cool down.  I love the environment and the people in this video, but they are different/new people from past videos.

Overall, I really enjoy this video and is now one in my ""used frequently"" pile.",1319587200,4,914,4.284883720930233

I did the entire 5 miles, gave it my all, and was winded during the cool-down. I'm a 4 and 5 mile Leslie exerciser, but this is a total body workout and my new favorite, hands-down. When going into the next mile, keep walking so you won't feel like you've lost your pace. When she's off-beat or off-step, just adjust your footing. These are minor things to me, because she gets off-beat in every dvd that I own, and I've gotten used to her missteps. This workout is more of a ""Bootcamp"" than her ""Bootcamp"" dvd, no kidding!

4649023,5,B005BX3NKK,"I LOVE this new workout. I've been doing Leslie's workout for 10 years now and have dozens of them. I use her workouts at least 5 days a week since January. In recent months I've been using mostly her 4 and 5 miles and was excited to get a new 5 mile. In less than 3 weeks, what a difference already- my clothes are all looser. My legs and arms especially are toning up and slimming down more. If you do this video from warm-up to end of stretch it is 87 minutes. Sometimes on the weekend I even do it twice a day. At first I thought it was a bit slower in pace, but it picks up and with the strength training bits, it is a real workout! I even get out of breath sometimes in this workout and I never do in her other workouts. I don't understand the review which said this isn't a real workout. Sometimes instead of the stretch band I use Leslie's 2 lb. handweights during the strength training parts. Awesome! Yes, many of the same moves, but she nicely adds some new steps(love the cha cha wish there was more of it). I also like she changes between moves faster(less walking in place in between say sidesteps and knee lifts etc) which really bumps up the workout. Lots and lots of sidesteps in this one. There is a short pause transition between miles(this happens in her 5 mile fat burning too)- just keep walking, it's like 3 seconds. Why is this a problem for people? I use that time to grab a sip of water! Each mile starts off a bit slower than end of previous mile, but she bumps up the pace during the mile. This is how all her miles work in her other videos too. It is a better workout when you do it this way(like interval training), better than keeping a high pace constant. Don't worry about that. Is this video perfect? No. Is it an excellent QUALITY workout? YES!!!! I would not hesitate to recommend this. I love her new walkers(yes some of them really fit- inspirational!). Only thing like some of her other recent dvds the music is too quiet. I watch tv while I do this anyway(dvd playing on my laptop). I listen to her cues.

4649026,5,B005BX3NKK,"I have to say I was afraid this would be a rehash of other videos or carbon copy workouts to new music... all which I have enjoyed, nonetheless.  This video is completely different.  New moves, most of which, I like.  New music.  I like it all but wish the gal singing, ""I say a little prayer for you,"" would have sang the entire song not just part of it.
In this video there is no classic Leslie pep talk.  Have to say I miss it but the video is great without it too.  There is no spiritual inspiration or ""hallelujah"". There is also no regular walkers/gang but I recognize at least one thin blonde from, I think, the 3 mile weight loss walk video.  The new walkers who do the most strenuous workout all through the 5 mile video with Leslie are young and lean but not obnoxious.  The other walkers who do the warm-up, first mile, last mile, and cool-down include the thin girls and some others who are probably working for Leslie and then there are some ""real folks"" who were invited to walk, I think.  They might be from Facebook or other local walkers.
All of the video is high-energy and fun and very doable, however, after three days of doing the entire 5 miles I was absolutely exhausted.  It is that 4th mile with the mini boot camp that is what makes you sore.  It truly is a full body workout.  Probably better not to do it everyday.  Mix it up a bit with other videos.
I've been walking with Leslie since March 2011 and have many, many Leslie videos.  Even though it is a long video (1 hour and 20 min), the moves change so much, and so often that the time goes fast.  It is by far the best ""Leslie"" yet.  BTW:  She also looks thinner and more updated, too.  The other videos i have seem out of date now since this new one.

I actually like that. Leslie stays with one motion long enough to really work that group of muscles. Then she very quickly transitions from one movement to the next, which I personally found wonderfully challenging (and sometimes exhausting). The new movements were fun. I thought it felt like a mini-bootcamp. I was sweating by the middle of the second mile. So, why was I considering four stars? For the same reasons I saw in other 2-4 star reviews: the music was like, meh. And the pause between miles was frustrating, but I just kept a power walk going until the next mile kicked in. And, yeah, each new mile seemed a little slow to start. And, then there's this silly sentimental thing...I missed seeing some of the old faces from the other DVDs. Nevertheless, this is a great workout, and I loved the stretchy band exercises. I thought that there was a lot of variety in this DVD, which kept it fun and interesting, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars.

Have I done better workouts with Leslie? Sure! Back when they were showing her workouts on Exercise TV.

Let me say this isn't a bad DVD at all. I really enjoyed the change from some earlie f2f workouts she had on YouTube.  Some of her moves were different, and it took me a few tries to get the hang of it, but I got a great workout and my thighs are screaming today.

I read the negative reviews (I do this for everything I buy) and saw some comments about the last mile. No, she doesn't always prompt when moves are about to change as often as she could,  and, yes, she must have forgotten about her Facebook exercise, but this is still a great workout.

If you're getting tired of doing just a couple of miles, I think you will enjoy these workouts. Just be aware she has some new moves not used in her earlier workouts (anyone who remembers back in 2007 when we pretty only did 4 moves and the kick backs).

I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. Very rarely do I give 5 stars for anything (just so you know).

My advice for anyone who hasn't done thigh work in a while, do that mile last. I could barely get my legs to lift for the last few rounds of knee ups.",1522368000,2,1303,4.102362204724409
