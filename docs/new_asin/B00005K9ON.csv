7942894,3,B00005K9ON,"This movie told the sad tale of 2 well meaning guys who decided to buy a bar that had a flourishing business.  Getting the down payment wasn't easy.  They didn't get a non-compete clause, so the original owner became their competition.  Add to that chef problems, musician problems, more money problems and more.  This is a great movie for teens - lots of these things wouldn't have happened had these guys taken school seriously.",1465430400,,430,4.77027027027027
