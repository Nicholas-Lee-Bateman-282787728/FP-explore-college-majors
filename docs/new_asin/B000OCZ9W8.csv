8184529,4,B000OCZ9W8,"As a longtime  resident of So. Fla. I've lived through hurricanes, actually was outdoors fighting to save my Florida room as neighbors' homes came apart around me during the back end of 2005's Hurricane Wilma. So several descriptions of the '38 storm don't surprise or dazzle me,, not after what I've seen. Many are too familiar.

Of personal interest in this American Experience documentary is that my mom was in some way changed by that untitled cyclone. On more than one occasion in my childhood she recounted events that happened almost without prior warning in New Haven on Sept. 21st '38.

The part here about the calm eye is absolutely accurate. In '05 the eye of Wilma went directly overhead and I had time to move my car, borrow a neighbor's ladder, fix a loose gutter and return the ladder before the storm's fiercer ""back"" end started shooting debris bullets  past me at 110 mph. It was unforgettably surreal. Not sure how I escaped injury.

This documentary tells of coastal Rhode Island's tragic day. (Note Providence is 50 mi. from the Elm City. Nearly worst was what occurred immediately after the storm passed in urban areas.

""The Hurricane of '38"" is very fine history telling that's often heartrending or infuriating (because of the injustice of fate)..Well presented, as all this series is, and well worth seeing.",1473465600,,1333,4.876106194690266
8184530,4,B000OCZ9W8,"My mom was 14 and living in Massachusetts at the time the great hurricane of '38 struck the northeast. I remember her telling me stories about that storm but it wasn't until I saw the PBS series ""American Experience: The Hurricane Of '38"" that I began to understand what she and everyone else who lived in the New England area really went through. It certainly brought back for her a lot of memories of that time. This is a fascinating look at that storm with interviews with people who survived that horrible nightmare as they gave their accounts of what they saw, heard and felt as nature unleashed its fury on the northeast. The newsreel footage of the storm helps to give the viewer a better understanding of what occurred too.

The events that occurred are twofold in making this hurricane so deadly. First of course is the fact that at that time there were no weather satellites circling above to give weathermen information on how the storm was growing and where it most likely was heading too to be able to warn people of its path. Without such technology existing yet the National Weather Service had to depend on ships out at sea to provide word of storms that were brewing out in the Atlantic. Problem there was that there were ships passing along the word there was a big storm forming but the NWS was certain the hurricane would hit around Cape Hatteras and break up. As ships kept reporting the storm was moving northward the NWS thought the reports were inaccurate and didn't release any warnings until it was too late.

""American Experience"" is a series that mostly looks at the history of our country. But you don't have to be a fan of or even like history to be caught up in the stories being told of this deadly hurricane. It is compelling to watch leaving the viewer to wonder how they would have reacted facing such danger that could mean almost certain death. It is such a shame though that they don't have a DVD of this program offered at a much more reasonable price.",1380758400,,1991,4.527777777777778
8184531,5,B000OCZ9W8,"I adore this documentary. That it's being sold new for almost four-hundred dollars and used for two-hundred is a thousand pities. PBS erroneously claims (or claimed, some months ago) that ""The Hurricane of 1938"" was part of a six-DVD set about the Great Depression, but that is untrue. When asked, PBS said that their write-up was wrong, the box set lists a different film, and they have no way of knowing when they will be making this DVD available again.

As for the film itself, the footage is fabulous, the people interviewed articulate and still incredulous, after so many decades, that they escaped with their lives.

That an entire attic floor of a house in Rhode Island can shear off, sail across Narragansett Bay, and land -- safely -- in Connecticut, with an entire household, including servants, clinging to the joists -- beggars the imagination.

I look forward to the rerelease of ""The Hurricane of 1938."" It tells a history we should know -- about a man who did predict the hurricane and was ignored by his employer, the Weather Service; about people who weren't warned; and about a storm that wreaked devastation in a time before television made everything instantaneous.",1369094400,8,1186,4.890547263681592
8184532,5,B000OCZ9W8,This dvd is the definitive documentary on the Great New England Hurricane of 1938.  The rare footage alone taken during the storm is outstanding!  5-stars!!!,1296518400,7,157,5.24
8184533,5,B000OCZ9W8,"We have this 'American Experience' documentary on VHS and wish we could afford a copy on DVD.  We are from New Orleans and have survived Hurricanes Betsy, Camille and Katrina.  This story is a fantastic assortment of interviews made with those that witnessed the storm and lived to tell the tale - along with actual film footage that makes you think you are there - right in the thick of it in those depression times.  We were surprised at all of the looting (just as we saw in New Orleans and on the Gulf Coast when working for Civil Defense).  The death toll did not distinguish between the servant and the rich.  My wife and I agree that this is one of our favorite documentaries.  We love extremely stormy weather and find it very exciting, but not when it hurts or kills people (especially if it be us).",1282003200,5,808,4.425675675675675
8184534,5,B000OCZ9W8,"This entry into the American Experience series is a riveting look at the Hurricane of '38. My father was born that year and we live in Rhode Island, so it is of particular interest to me. The interviews with people who actually lived through the hurricane as well as the historic footage is just so interesting. It's very well done. I highly recommend this video. Also, the vendor Amazon used to sell and ship the product was excellent. They gave me a complimentary shipping upgrade and included a personal, handwritten note thanking me for my business. The video was in new condition. Excellent.",1276560000,3,596,4.796116504854369
8184535,5,B000OCZ9W8,"People in the Northeast have this idea that hurricanes are southern storms. This PBS special on the Hurricane of 1938 makes it most clear that the entire north east coast of the U.S. is most vulnerable .After New Orleans and Miami ,New York City is the third most vulnerable city to hurricanes.

 What makes this particular story so tragic is that there was no warning. Weather forcasters believed the hurricane would go safely out to sea.

I t wasn't until a thirty foot wall of water smashed into Long island that the catastrophy began to unfold. Well done including interviews with survivors,",1180742400,9,595,4.813725490196078
