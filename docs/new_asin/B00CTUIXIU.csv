8586213,5,B00CTUIXIU,"There are many things to like about this film and DVD.  First, it's got some of the best photography of the Bridge I've seen.  Second, there is the wonderful music the composers wove out of the ""sampled"" sounds of the Bridge itself, music that was played for the 50th anniversary celebration.  The Day in the Life film is quite wonderful, showing the GGB as we who live in the Bay Area think of it -- an organic entity in and of itself, beyond time, use, and space.  The DVD also contains a demonstration of the wonderful little app the Apple corps folk can pick up and play the sampled sounds for themselves.  And of course the music the San Francisco Synthesizer Ensemble created from those sounds.  More than this, the entire DVD is an exploration of the way an icon can become the inspiration for lovely work in different creative disciplines -- film, music, photography -- over a lifetime.  Treat yourself.",1369958400,2,911,4.62111801242236
