Of course it was a low budget film, and what some might say ""Cheesy"" acting, and I am definitely biased, because of my dad being in the movie. However, look past the production, get into the story line, and the characters, and look at what it might have been if it was developed with better technology and in the present day! I am a writer, looking to write and direct my first movie, and have been a HUGE movie lover since my first movie. What was done in this movie, in 1979, was a unique approach to the craft and the writing is decent, with lots of historical facts included, explaining the landscape and environment the characters were in. There is also a diverse range of background in the characters that progressed well with the movie's overall progression and synthesis. It may not be a gory slasher film, but it has great twists and turns. Looking back on the times I have watched it, great fun! Use your imagination and enjoy the laughs and scares!",1477872000,,1069,4.459183673469388
