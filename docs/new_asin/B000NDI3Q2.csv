2766220,5,B000NDI3Q2,"I remember seeing this classic animated series late at nite on Cartoon Network some 8 odd years ago. I NEVER thought it would get a DVD release. The style of the series and the storylines are classic and there is nothing else quite like it around. Some episodes may not be great but most of them are really well written, and some I can't believe ever aired on network television! They certainly tackled topics ahead of other shows except for All in the Family. If you are wanting a great companion to Family Guy and Simpsons Buy this Set today! Only Two Seasons so hopefully they will release the Second and Final Season that features many guest star voices soon.",1181692800,5,663,4.533333333333333
2766221,5,B000NDI3Q2,"I agree with several other reviewers that I never thought that this series would ever get a DVD release. The fact Hanna-Barbera shows like ""jabberjaw"" and ""Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels"" remain unreleased even though they are probably easier to market makes this DVD's release that much sweeter.

""Wait till your father gets home"" aired in the early 70's and then enjoyed a short run in syndication- most recently on cartoon network. Following the everyday trials of the Boyle family, the series dealt with topical issues of the day. While they were not the first primetime animated family (i believe the flintstones get that honor) they were thr predesessors to shows like the Simpsons and King of the Hill. The show is certainly not politically correct with Harry's neighbor spouting about communists and women's liberation and tackling the subject of obesity and opting out. Some episodes are terribly dated but thats half the fun.

Here's hoping we get another season of the Boyle family on DVD.",1181606400,8,1005,5.0119760479041915
2766222,5,B000NDI3Q2,"Just as ""The Flintstones"" was modeled after ""The Honeymooners,"" WAIT TIL YOUR FATHER GETS HOME is the animated cousin of ""All in the Family.""  And, just as ""All in the Family"" broke new ground, so does this fantastic Hanna-Barbera classic.  The hot-button topics of the early 70s are all here -- feminism, bigotry, even nudism! -- and the scripts are superly written, surprisingly bold and truly funny.  Top-notch voice talent, too, featuring Tom Bosley, Allan Melvin, John Stevenson, Sandra ""Gladys Kravitz"" Gould, Casey Kasem, and more.

Also, THANK YOU to this set's producers for keeping the show's laugh track, as it originally aired.  Given that the series is a bonafide sitcom and aired in primetime, the laugh track is totally appropriate here -- and actually adds to the fun.

If you are a ""Simpsons"" fan, that show would be unthinkable had WAIT TIL YOUR FATHER GETS HOME not paved the way.  And even if you're not, this 4-disc set makes for hours of terrific watching.

Get this!",1181088000,25,989,4.880239520958084
2766223,5,B000NDI3Q2,"I was skeptical at first, but my expectations were totally underating this show. I own all the other Hanna-Barbera DVD collections, and as an avid collector of special edition DVDs, I look forward to each new Hanna-Barbera release. It gives me a chance to own all of those I've watched as a kid and catch up on those I've not got to know as much. However, being someone who's just under 30 years of age, I had never even heard of ""Wait Till Your Father Gets Home"".

Though, after buying this collection this morning and having watched a couple of episodes, I have to say that I actually like this old classic. With a touch of modern animation (for its time) and with the real life issues that were plaguing the baby boomer generation as they were growing up, this show will actually entertain (perhaps even shock) you as you become engrossed in it.

Compariable to the Simpsons and Family Guy, this is the show that started prime time network animation as we know it today. As due with All in the Family, this show seems to tackle issues that many considered too liberal for tv (then and now).

The animation drawings were a bit suprising to me at first. Not exactly ""state of the art"", but after watching these episodes more, I believe the different forms of drawing in the backgrounds (even the charecters) were a signature of its time and generation. It's different, and even looks a bit cheap. But after watching it more, its apparent that all the art work took as much time to create and construct as the other Hanna-Barbera cartoons before did. From a historical perspective, and as a tribute, I really like this new ""groovy"" animation.

I can't wait to watch the rest of the DVD release and anticipate news of the 2nd Season's release. Keep 'em coming Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros.",1181001600,17,1789,4.598746081504702
2766224,5,B000NDI3Q2,"I LOVE when rare 1970s cartoons get the DVD treatment, especially in full season box sets like this...seeing this set gives me hope that OTHER funny/forgotten cartoons that inspired todays favorites like Simpsonas and Family Guy will also be brought back into the hands of hungry buyers like myself...we've been seeing a HUGE flood of great old-school Saturday morning cartoon releases from various companys lately, and it feels GREAT...I'm DYING to see other fun 1970s shows like The Barkleys (""All in the Family"" parody), Roman Holidays (like a Roman version of the ""Flintstones""), Oddball Couple (""Odd Couple"" parody), Carlton, Your Doorman (an animated TV special about the doorman from Rhoda), These Are the Days (sort of like a ""Waltons"" cartoon, well written...), and a few of the ""licensed"" properties such as Fantastic Voyage, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Tarzan, and Rocket Robin Hood...Saturday mornings can be fun again, just have to buy them all on DVD...i'm willing to...!!!",1180137600,4,995,5.225

2766226,5,B000NDI3Q2,"Wow! Never in my wildest dreams did I think this classic 70's cartoon would get released on dvd!!! I remember when the cartoon network briefly aired the episodes in prime-time several years ago. Unfortunately they were recorded on vhs from a old tv at the time, so the episodes had very poor sound quality. At that point I was just happy to record one of my favorite cartoon shows of the 1970's!!!

The Boyle family included father Harry Boyle(voiced by Tom Bosley of Happy Days), wife Irma, oldest son Chet, daughter Alice, and youngest son Jamie. The oldest son Chet was a college dropout, who still lived at home and never really wanted to work. Alice was the sweet overweight daughter who was always the free thinker, and wanting to try new things, and the youngest son Jamie was the little capitalist always trying to make a fast buck! The mother Irma was just plain hilarious in her way of thinking and that whiney nasal voice simply added to the humor! There was also Harry's nextdoor neighbor Ralph, who was this military fanatic, that was paranoid about so-called communist, and being ready to attack at anytime.

Althought Wait til your father gets home only lasted about 2 full seasons, they included some very funny episodes and funny guest stars like the voices of Don Knotts, Phyliss Diller, and Monty Hall. One of my favorite episodes was when Dad Harry Boyle decided to build a swimming pool and the nightmare that came along with it. I also loved the episode when the Boyles go on a summer vacation and there are nudist hanging around on the beach. Wow! I can't wait to enjoy this show all over again on dvd!!! June 5th can't come fast enough!!!",1175299200,40,1662,4.6305084745762715
2766257,5,B000NDI3Q2,"The DVD is great. It features the Boyles set in the present (at the time 1972) unlike the Flintstones,Roman Holidays,or the Jetsons. It reflects the problems of the time in a humorous manner. It is an outstanding series. This set only contains the first season(there is a second season,but not available on DVD yet).",1470528000,,316,4.87037037037037

2766259,5,B000NDI3Q2,"""Wait Till Your Father Gets Home"" series story writer/editor Norman Paul had worked for Norman Lear and wrote episodes of ""All In The Family"" and ""Good Times"" so he added a ""1970s relevancy"" to the storylines.

The humor was rather mature with familiar Hanna Barbera kiddie cartoon voice actors such as Don Messick, Lennie Weinrib, John Stephenson, Allen Melvin, and Alan Oppernheimer performing dialogue about strained parent/teenaged kids relations, politics, bigotry in the form of next-door neighbor/bumbling neighborhood militia leader Ralph, inflation, drugs, hippies, anti war protestors, and the occasional effeminate male character.  Tom Bosley played the harried but understanding father three years before playing a live action version in ""Happy Days"".  Jamie the youngest son was played by Jackie Earle Haley (""Watchmen"") in season one and Willie Aames (""Eight Is Enough"") in season two.  Chet was played by David Hayward (Robert Altman's ""Nashville"") in season one and Lennie Weinrib in season two.
Jack Burns (""Huh? Yeah. Huh? Yeah."") played reactionary Ralph.

The art design was by Marty Murphy who worked on many H-B series such as Hong Kong Phooey and the 1970s Tom and Jerry cartoons.

Like The Flintstones and The Jetsons, The Boyle family was a product of its times...in this case, finding humor during the turbulent 1970s instead of prehistoric or futuristic times.  The pilot episode ""Love and the Old Fashioned Father"" was aired in the 1970s comedy anthology series ""Love American Style"" (Producers RS Allen and Harvey Bullock wrote episodes for both ""Love"" and ""Wait Till"") without Jamie the youngest son.  The pilot for Bosley's ""Happy Days"" series was also shown first as a ""Love American Style"" story, with Harold Gould playing Howard Cunningham instead of Bosley.",1465084800,,1792,5.352313167259786
2766260,5,B000NDI3Q2,"Best bit (from Ralph):  Communists, Minorities, liberals, Catholics, hippies, they're all trying to take over the country.
Harry:  Ralph, that is the country.... and how are they going to take over?
Ralph:  Pornography and fluoridation.

I love this show.  It's both a wonderful time capsule from '72, and completely relevant for today, as it tackles:  the generation gap, Ralph the neighbor who sees everything as a communist conspiracy, and hiring of minorities!

I especially love Ralph (here talking about hippies):  ""I heard him singing those anti-American songs about peace and love""",1459641600,3,589,5.395604395604396

2766262,5,B000NDI3Q2,"I Remember watching this cartoon as a child, and even though the issues covered on this series were adult-oriented in nature, I thought that 'Wait Till Your Father Gets Home' was one of the best and the funniest animated series to come from Hanna-Barbera since 'The Flintstones'! It's so much like its live counterpart 'All in The Family', you would think that Norman Lear assited the writers with the writing & development of the episodes!  The show was quite unique and innovative for the time that it was shown on TV.
I own the DVD of the first season, and I certainly hope that they will release the second season on DVD very soon!

Despite the reviews, Harry Boyle is not so much a ""conservative"" in the political sense but a defender of rationality in a world confused by the increasingly divisive politics and social conflict of the early 1970's.  However, Harry is usually able to bridge the gap between his progressive children and his paranoid, bigoted neighbors.  Most importantly, Harry is respectful of his children's point of view while still serving as the moral center of his household. In all, it's a far cheerier world than, say, All in the Family.

As far as the animation goes, it's not earthshaking, but it is stylish, with abstract minimalist backgrounds that are quite pleasing.",1193529600,4,779,5.015503875968992

2766390,5,B000NDI3Q2,"It goes to show that you can't judge a book by its cover or basically listen to what folks say about this series.  I wasn't aware of this show back when it came out so many years ago.  But i got into it while seeing it on cable more than a few times so i did the search and found it here.  Bought it and within a couple episodes i was already hooked.  It took me by surprise some of things that get discussed at first but i realize race relations, feminism, communism, sexual liberation, women's lib and all that was a huge deal especially back in that time era.  So with that i was able to look at those issues and take them to heart and learn a couple things from them as well.  Just so folks know that race gets hit quite a bit in this series...i don't think its enough to stop someone from buying this.  Because its done well and doesnt detract from the series as a whole.

I love all the characters in the Boyle family and the show in general especially the youngest son he's like a going to be Donald Trump with all the money he's making in the show.  Very level business type for a kid thats impressive always looking for a deal and coming to the aid of the father.  Chet and his sis always seem to be on the Father about things he's doing and what he should be doing..coming from a guy that hasn't worked a steady job for any amount of time, is out of college and lives at home.  He's not in a position to really go there even though he does much to his Dad's dismay.

This is a series that while it has serious undertones they never bring down the show and actually make it better to watch.  Give it a shout and you'll find another something to enjoy & add to your collection.",1189814400,7,1685,4.085106382978723

It dealt with issues that were important at the time (some which still are) and put a humorous twist on it.  Harry, Ermma, Chet, Alice, and Jaime still make me laugh.  I recently discovered that it comes on late at night on the Boomerang channel.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find every single episode to record.  I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am to have found the entire first season on DVD!  Season two is even better.  I can't wait for that one to be available on DVD as well.  This was money well spent.",1185321600,2,609,4.189655172413793
2766392,5,B000NDI3Q2,"Yes as some reviews say it in part was to cash in on the success of All in The Family but to also express youth movements and demonstrations originally from the 1960's and left over in the 1970's like women wanting their equal rights to great degrees. This cartoon got away with what it did being a cartoon and probably because the censors couldn't prevent what was seen before its release?Including showing a toilet in the bathroom on the right side of the screen of which one night on Nick@Nite on A Brady Block Party Summer Night when they showed on The Brady Bunch in a Bathroom scene a red arrow pointing down on The right hand side of the Screen where it was but before it was ever filmed the Censors ordered it to be removed. While in All in The Family it was the 1st show to have a toilet sound flushing in the background behind a bathroom door. One Tuesday night both my older and younger Brother found this cartoon on when they didn't like the episode of the show that we usually watched nightly at that time that we watch that was on that night. They found this on another State's Channel in 1973 and then later on in that same year in The Fall it came on to one of our local State's Channels. As I'd also find out sometime before it got to that one of my local States Channel as My Mom asked one night ""Wasn't this cartoon on Love American Style."" my Older Sister then said to her ""Yes that's right,""and I even later saw it on a rerun of a Summer morning in one room in which my Father was watching it and told all of the family of whom were home and we then got to watching it too and got to see some clips of which were at the opening of the weekly series too. Like when Alice came home all beat up after her date of which back then they'd never show on a live action TV Show. But What I may be most impressed with might be the father and how his voice stood out so that when I heard it on TV one night in the next room and it turned out to be the father on ""Happy Days."" instead and when that show was new and another Love American Style inspiration from it's sequence of ""Love and the Happy Days.""Yes Tom Bosley really stands out and he even got to succeed the role of Howard Cunningham because Harold Gould was on Vacation and unavailable to reprise it.",1185062400,,2270,4.138009049773756

2766395,5,B000NDI3Q2,"I never got to see this show since it was run while I was out of the country and had no syndication action in my area (unlike the Jetsons and Flintstones). I finally got a chance to watch it when Boomerang started running it in the wee hours. Amazing how good this show is - it's able to keep up with the times without looking like a normal Hanna-Barbera show.

I do hope they put out season 2 since that has the great guest appearances by Don Knotts, Monty Hall, Jonathon Winters and Rich Little.",1182211200,4,497,4.231578947368421
2766396,5,B000NDI3Q2,"For many years I thought this show was just something from my imagination. I was very little (around age four or five) when this show was on and honestly the only thing I remembered was the theme song. To have this show on DVD finally is great. It proves that I didn't imagine this!! What's interesting watching the show today is how adult and politically incorrect the show actually is, that is what makes it so great. In the very first scene of the first episode the father makes fat jokes at the expense of his daughter. Then there are the racist comments coming from the next door neighbor. The show is basically All In The Family in animated form. For fans of The Simpsons and more so Family Guy check out this show and see where the blueprint for those shows came from.
 The animation leaves something to be desired, but the storylines are really funny and in today's uptight society you'll be amazed that a show like this was ever on the air, let alone a cartoon!",1181779200,11,970,4.418994413407821

8177269,5,B000NDI3Q2,"I found the intro to this show on youtube many years ago, and watched the episode where harry gets mugged. I laughed really hard. I love how harry's neighbor is supposed to describe the mugger to the police but is describing his bowling ball instead. I picked up the dvd set not long after, but when my dvds got scratched, I bought a new dvd. And I still love this show. This was an adult cartoon long before the Simpsons and family guy. Harry grew up in the time of malt shops, simple fun, and boys with short haircuts. His daughter is a feminist, his wife is dimwitted, his son is a bit of a hippie and his other son loves to make money (even if it's paying people to look at his father's injured head). It's a very funny show, a bit outdated, but still funny. It's been called an animated version of all in the family, but I think harry has more heart than archie bunker. The show is a bit outdated, but it's still funny. It's a forgotten hanna-barbera jem",1474329600,3,959,4.245901639344262
