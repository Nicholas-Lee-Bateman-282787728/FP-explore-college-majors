8357894,5,B0029KUHWA,"I checked this video out from the library, and then decided I must have a copy of my own. This film is absolutely brilliant.

Whales are graceful and amazing. Their size and majesty will capture you, as does A Life Among Whales. Many videos have been made about these giant creatures, but of all the ones I've seen, this one is the best.",1323561600,,337,4.349206349206349

8357896,1,B0029KUHWA,"Dr. Payne's compassion and enthusiasm for whales is quite admirable. I'm very pleased to know whales have an advocate such as him on their side. That being said, he lets his emotions get the better of him. What I saw in ""A Life Among Whales"" was a temper tantrum and what I actually learned about whales was next to nothing. I did learn that people remain to be awful and evil and the whales innocent and good...ostensibly under any circumstances. I also learned that whaling is an expression of ""machismo""...a word Payne uses frequently throughout the program. Payne is not honest with himself. He points-out that the romanticism about man against sea was propaganda used by the evil whaling industry of old. He says it was very far from the truth and that the men on the ships were actually quite miserable. In this instance Dr. Payne is unequivocally right as eating gruel, dodging scurvy and drinking minuscule portions of un-sanitized water all the while enduring the full blunt of the sea's weather without north face or HH gear is indeed a miserable existence. Oh and risking life and limb. Yes, doctor I'm quite sure that even today's whalers would rather be somewhere else. So, it begs the question, Payne, why did they go? In his attempts to enlighten us about the misunderstood world of the whales, he ought to spend more time with his own kind. Machismo did not put rational men into harm's way...economic incentives did. What is very interesting is that when I did a quick google search on 'products made from whales' what do you think I found? I didn't find giant taxidermy whale trophies adorning some machismo's living room. Nor did I find great phalluses made from a whale's rib bone. No Dr., what I found is that makeup is one of the many ""consumer"" products made from whales. Make-up is a thing that women typically use. And as consumption goes, women far exceed men in what they consume, particularly in their use of disposable items. And what is make-up used for...Dr. Payne? Vanity...ahem not machismo. So, you see sir it's not this mucho group of men conspiring in dark corners to kill and gloat about it. Whales are harvested from nature for the same reasons why chickens are slaughtered...to provide for humans. And we are all guilty of this, but if you are going to split hairs and pick on certain people, you need to know that you are part of this force too. I'm sure you go out of your way to not consume a product made from whales. Okay, but how many other products made from other precious animals of the world did you consume just today? You'd be surprised good doctor. And you say, we can make it synthetically? Really, that's actually causing cancer and other abnormalities. Dr. Payne you see nature through rose colored glasses. That huge animal is beautiful and majestic but they are not innocent either. Beneath those waves is a struggle you can't even begin to imagine. Never mind you floating around them, everyday is a fight for survival. All that time observing whales and you never made the only connection between them and us, which is, we all fight to survive. Well most of us, a small few can make a living swimming around the ocean. Have you ever asked yourself what would the whales do if they evolved to be the intellectually superior beings on Earth? You think they wouldn't exploit us? You have clearly led a very privileged life...if I were you I would concentrate on being more grateful for it. The harsh truth is anyone would trade their monotonous life to live on a bay in Patagonia...MOST CAN'T for reason I'm sure your liberal mind would disagree with. Give thanks that you were created human and not a lesser animal and that you are relatively intelligent enough to pursue your dreams. Instead what do you do...you turn back at the rest of us and label us killers and evil. Dr. Payne be happy with what you have, sorry to tell you whales were there before you and will be there after you.",1320624000,,3944,4.643776824034335
8357897,5,B0029KUHWA,"I was thinking I was going to see a beautiful film about Whales, it is nice, but I cry so much, I already support green peace and stuff to stop whale hunting but I did learn some things so it was good
I am glad I bought it I hope it help a little
Love Whales!!",1281312000,3,260,3.6607142857142856
8357898,4,B0029KUHWA,"In ""Life Among Whales,"" Roger Payne makes a personal statement about the intelligence and creativity of cetaceans. Unique in this film's approach is that Payne connects to whales not only as a biologist but as a musician. His research into their songs reveals that it is, in fact, actual music, and his efforts to share and popularize the songs of the humpbacks over the years have bolstered awareness and conservation efforts. Also of interest is the fact that whale songs can be heard through thousands of miles of ocean, which suggests an amazing communication network. I'm a former cruising sailor and also an avid musician, so this film appealed to both my love of the oceans and of music. Not mentioned in the film is the possibility that sonar, marine equipment and industry could be creating sub-ocean noise pollution that could be socially disrupting or even damaging to cetaceans.

Payne is neither glamorous, not self-celebratory. He's a humble, compassionate scientist interested in sharing what he knows and in inspiring concern for the impacts of man's inhumanity on the oceans and potentially back on ourselves.

The cinematography balances scenes of brutal whale slaughter against some beautiful underwater footage that shows the grace, size and agility of these incredible animals in their own environment.

Overall, it's an excellent overview of the lives, politics and magic of whales, a good place to start if you want the big picture condensed into a compelling one-hour documentary.

I'm docking it one star because it doesn't ultimately conclude with specific recommendations for taking action. There's no website to accompany the film where viewers might connect to news or find links to conservation organizations, join mailing lists or sign petitions. It takes a regrettable ""build it and they will come"" attitude that suggests awareness will lead to action.

There are also a number of related documentaries this film could refer viewers to without losing sales...and let's face it, films like this are made for love, not money anyway. These films include ""The Cove"" and ""End of The Line."" I would also encourage interested viewers to read Farley Mowat's ""Sea of Slaughter"" for background on the long-term history of man's war against the oceans.",1279238400,8,2273,5.199453551912568
