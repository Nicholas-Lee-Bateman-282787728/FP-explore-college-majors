3622385,4,B001H1I8KK,"This direct to DVD adaptation of book 1 of the Clique series was pretty awesome! The cast from the movie are very true to the characters of the book! The plot is basically the same as book 1. It is appropriate for girls of all ages and is colorful, fast paced and funny. I would definitely recommend this movie to fans of the series! My favorite was the actress that plays Dylan! she was Ah-dorable (though not chubby like how i thought dylan would be.)",1228521600,,453,4.341176470588235
3622386,4,B001H1I8KK,"Because this movie was direct-to-video, I thought it would be unwatchable and a complete misrepresentation of the books. The movie used actual lines from the book, which definietly scored high with me because I hate book-to-movies that don't translate. The adaptation put the Clique in a different light than I was used to. It showed Massie as someone everyone hated but bowed down to anyways for reasons not explained. I was happily surprised to see that parts of it were quite good and actually touching.

That said, the non-quite good parts varied from being watchable to hilariously bad. Other than that, it actually wasn't that funny unless you're making fun of it so it's not really a comedy. Or a drama. I'm not sure how the critics reacted to the movie, or even that they reviewed it, but it's sad to see that this movie didn't get a chance to go to theaters. Maybe the sequel...?",1227916800,,888,4.6923076923076925

3622388,4,B001H1I8KK,"I loved it!  I really hope that they continue to make more movies out of this series.  I'm OBSESSED with this series, and I feel a bit ashamed since I'm almost 18 and these girls are still in 7th grade!  I remember reading this book when I was in 7th grade.

This movie was very refreshing and the only bad thing about it was that the acting was kind of unnatural and forced at times.  But unlike most movies based on books, the plot actual flowed nicely and didn't get stuck on irrelevant things.

The book was well-adapted into a movie, even though there were some things that happened in the movie that didn't happen in the book.  Which was kind of cool, because copying the book word for word would've made it an epic fail.  This movie was anything but an epic fail.  It wasn't super-duper-amazing, but it was amazing enough to make me create an amazon account to make a review about it!",1227052800,4,891,4.351515151515152
3622389,4,B001H1I8KK,I had very little hope for this when I sat down with my daughters to watch it. By the end of the movie it was clear that they all enjoyed it and so did I. One of my girls has read the books and said it was very close to it. Lets hope there are more of these.,1227052800,33,258,3.4655172413793105
3622390,4,B001H1I8KK,"To the people who bought ""The Clique"" from Amazon, read the first review 'cause there are faulty batches!

Anyway, back to the movie.
Okay, I started reading the Clique when I was 12 and that was 4 years ago. Now I'm 16 and the Clique girls are still 12 in the very first movie.

Remembering back to the very first book and watching this movie is surreal. The movie is almost nothing how I pictured the book in my mind, but they do a very nice, accurate portrayal of the book.

The movie follows the basic plot line, includes many of the characters, ha very interesting fashion, actually has the IMing and State of the Union parts, and quoted many of the funny lines from the book.

Although there were parts of the book that I missed (like the whole tights trend and the Massie insights), the most obvious jump from book to movie were the main characters. Alicia wasn't busty enough, but the whole ""rubbing boobs together"" part took on a whole new meaning. Massie acted a little too forced sometimes. Kristen wasn't sporty enough. However, this are minute details.

I definitely recommend this to all Clique fans because while it may be very different from what we saw in our minds, it still tells the timeless tale of fitting-in and insecurities with the ""loveable"" characters and their lines that we know!",1226966400,25,1308,4.5965665236051505

3622406,3,B001H1I8KK,"It's an all right movie because it managed to entertain me. However, there are a lot of things wrong with it. I've read the book as well, and have to say the book is slightly better, though it's not something I'd read again for the enjoyment. As for the movie, it just doesn't make much sense. Massie made up her mind to dislike Claire before even meeting her for the sole reason that she and her family show up on the day of a party Massie wants to go to. Then she dislikes her more because of the clothes she wears. That's the silliest reason to dislike somebody.

Massie's friends clearly cannot/do not think for themselves when they're around Massie. When Dylan and Claire first met, Dylan didn't seem to mind that Claire lacked a ""fashion sense"" and almost befriended her, until Massie shows her disapproval. Kristin even asks Massie, ""Do we like her?"" Claire herself makes it difficult to feel sorry for her. She made an instant friend out of Layne by simply asking her to hang out. Then she completely ditches Layne for a slumber party full of girls that can't stand her. That's brainless, and I don't understand why Claire wanted to be apart of their group so badly.

She did give a reason towards the end of the movie, but it wasn't a very good one to me, especially when she could have had so many other friends- real friends, not ones that only like someone for the money and popularity he or she has. I could tell that Massie didn't have real friends, either. Another thing that got on my nerves was Massie's parents and how they let her be disrespectful, and didn't bother disciplining her. It's perfectly fine to be wealthy, but don't spoil your kid like that and then get upset with her when she acts like a brat. The music in the movie was also obnoxious, but that was a minor annoyance and I just turned the volume down.

Despite my criticisms, it's an okay movie and somewhat entertaining, but it isn't really something I'd recommend people to watch unless they wanted a good laugh or something to make a face at once in a while. It does have a couple of funny moments, but those moments don't really save the movie as a whole.",1449100800,,2145,4.4529262086514

3622409,4,B001H1I8KK,"Firstly, I only watched this movie because my ten-year-old daughter is a great fan of the books. She is not into being popular or anything like what the girls in the Clique are but she does enjoy well-told, engaging stories, and she loves the books, so when I saw the film was available here for instant streaming, I decided to spend part of my Sunday watching it with her, just to see what the fuss was all about.

Let me start by saying that although I was initially horrified by the blatant narcissism of the main characters, I realized that many adolescents are focused on themselves and the story and film just took it a whole notch up by portraying how mean-spirited and self-involved the Clique girls were. Claire, a transplant from Florida, moves into alpha girl Massie's pool house as Claire's dad has just received a great job offer from Massie's dad (both girls' dads are good friends). Massie is resentful of Claire from the get go and makes life a living hell for the new girl, just because. The other girls in Massie's clique, i.e. Dylan, Felicia, and Kristen, come together under Massie's instigation to torment and belittle Claire. The story follows Claire as she goes from the trod upon new girl to someone who tries to change her own personality to fit in with the Clique, until she comes to the realization that changing one's personality and beliefs to fit in rarely ends with positive results.

The moral of the story is a good one and the actors portraying the various roles here do a credible job for the most part. The only bad word that I caught in the film was ""bitch"" which is used several times to describe certain characters. Other than that, I recommend watching this with a pre-teen and young teen girl as there are some life lessons to be learned.",1440892800,,1779,4.591194968553459

There were supposed to be sequels of this movie but unfortunately there won't be any more coming out.

This movie is a great film to watch with girlfriends- it's very funny and entertaining and is fun to see the book come to life onscreen. Elizabeth McLaughlin and Ellen Marlow were fantastic together.

No matter how much we think everyone worships us, we still have huge insecurities. It's definitely over-the-top and makes some good points about the social system of especially wealthy kids, and is very easily accessible.

I really like of this movie of how it shows that kids in schools try so hard to fit into these groups and be accpected from them. When I was in Middle School was more like Claire Lyons that I wanted to fit into this group that was similar to the Pretty Committees is Massie,Dylan and Alicia. I know this one girl when I was in Middle School who was like Massie. I found The Clique similar to Mean Girls Movie. Mean Girls is the movie for older teenagers Mean girls has more of Teen Wild partying and teens engaging in sex. I haven't read the book of The Clique I would love to read the book to find out if it's as good as the movie or better.

I have no kids, but I do have an interest in teen movies and young adult lit, which is why I snatched this movie when I saw it in the library.  Having read only one of the books, I should've known what I would encounter: a superficial story about a naive girl who tries to make a group of rich snots like her.  Apparently the books are meant to mock those who are obsess with big labels and being the biggest bullies in school, but the satire is well hidden if that's the case.  None of the characters' motivations made sense, and if I were Claire I'd be begging to be transferred to another school because of how mean Massie and her friends are.  What I hated the most was that the movie seemed to want me to sympathize with Massie, as if this was just as much her story as Claire's.  But I don't want to care about the bad guy - I want to see the bad guy get what's coming to her. Spoil alert: Massie never really gets what's coming to her.

Plus, there is a small scene where one of the girls' mother says that she won't buy her daughter clothes until she goes from a size 6 to a 4.  So disturbing and wrong.

I would be kind of disappointed if a daughter of mine liked this movie or the book series.",1257120000,3,1431,4.137184115523466

3622496,1,B001H1I8KK,"Shame one the makers of this ""movie"" and shame on the author. This is HORRIBLE entertainment for girls/teens.

Basically, it's the story of 4 spoiled, snotty, selfish, shallow girls who rule their school and ruin the lives of those around them. They play one mean trick after another on each other, and eventually even the ""sweet naive outcast"" girl in the movie ends up becoming nasty and deceitful just to get back at them. The ethics and morals are non-existent. I think it's a huge shame this pathetic excuse for an author was allowed to have such  shallow, dumb stories published, but whats worse is they made it into a movie. I really to believe movies like this encourage young girls to act like this - to treat each other like trash, compete ruthlessly for boys, and have egos the size of the universe. It's crap.

Luckily I didn't pay for it, just caught it on Lifetime and was shocked by the plot line at first, I kept watching hoping at some point there would be a lesson to be learned. But no. The entire movie is just a sad look at materialistic brats who supposedly are supposed to be role models and stars. Sickening. For shame LISI HARRISON!

I'd never heard of the Clique books, so I had no frame of reference and boy, was that ever a HUGE mistake.

We watched it and I hoped all the way through this dismal mess that there would be some redemption in the end, but there really wasn't. It was one long horrific bore about girls out-meaning each other to see which one could be the queen bee.

I found this movie to be anti-family and celebrative of a values system that I support in no way whatsoever. Clueless, hyper-indulgent parents and vicious, shallow kids, along with a school system in which even the teachers are hateful jerks make for a movie that is not even rentable from your local video store, let alone buyable.

Treat this nasty DVD the way you'd treat a puddle of toxic waste. Oh, for a zero stars option! I can't believe this is the kind of garbage being produced for our girls today.",1234483200,18,1033,4.426315789473684

But it did do a fantastic job on both. But i gave it a four star just because it wasn't exactly the way i thought it would be.
