8097490,1,B000CCQP2S,"Avoid buying this complete waste of money at all costs. When Eric Bana went solo, away from Fast Forward/Full Frontal, he brought on his own sketch/talk show. Each week he would interview people in character, preform a few sketches, jokes and best of all, made us all laugh with his best characters Poida, Ray Martin and Glen Ridge. But don't expect to see those great sketchs on this supposed ""entire series"".

I remember reading the review the next day after the first show of this series. It said that Eric had no intention of using the Poida character, but felt the show was not going so good, so he went for it with Poida. Then he was interviewing Craig Lowdes and Andrew Gaze. And only some of that footage is present on these ""entire series"" episodes. One of the first episodes was Eric talking about how he was a tuba player, and despised anyone else who played the tuba, because he thought they where better then him. He later found out Andrew Gaze plays the tuba, and it was on. Very little of that footage is on the episode here, and it makes no sense now as to why Eric asks Andrew why there is a tuba in his back seat (of his car) because the whole thing is not on these DVD's.

Its an absolute ripoff, 9 episodes on 2 discs, but that is 9 INCOMPLETE episodes mind you. It's been released by SHOCK who I guess think that by not including everything is what SHOCK is all about. They have done the same on every other Australian comedy show they have released. Even Full Frontal and Fast Forward have had this done where bits and pieces are missing. If it came down to copyright laws or not getting permission to show someones fact, then APOLOGIZE for it on the DVD's... however, it can't be the case, as HALF of the Andrew Gaze thing is shown, and the other half isn't.

So I cannot say enough, do not buy something that has false advertising on it. If you are going to fork over a ridicules price for 2 discs, and it says entire TV series on it, then you expect 2 discs with the entire series on it, right? And thats why this DVD is not worthy of purchasing. I think there was maybe 4 appearances by Poida on this thing, and he was in every episode once or twice and sometimes 3 times... SO SHOCK, WHERE IS THAT FOOTAGE IF THIS IS THE ""ENTIRE"" series?

I even called SHOCK to complain about this, and the nice woman on the phone said that it doesn't sound good that Shock would do such a thing, but I never heard a thing back from them after that. They even had the nerve to keep manufacturing this thing and repackaging it in a new sleeve so people who had bought it, might think they corrected their mistake... but what do you know, the DVD's inside the case are EXACTLY the same.

DO NOT BUY.",1324080000,,2708,4.28125
