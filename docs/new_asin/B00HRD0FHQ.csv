8634749,3,B00HRD0FHQ,"Released to TV in 2013 and directed by Jack Perez, ""Blast Vegas"" (aka Destruction: Las Vegas) concerns a group of college guys vacationing in Las Vegas, three of whom steal an ancient Egyptian sword from an exhibit and unwittingly unleash a colossal sand storm with other magical things, like a huge sand cobra.

I generally like TV-budgeted MOTW (Monster of the Week) movies. Gargoyles from 1972 is Exhibit A. Blast Vegas has a great setting and an interesting MOTW, albeit ludicrous. With a setting like Vegas youd expect a lot of comely females and the movie delivers to a degree, particularly in the first act. Most of the settings involve the group of protagonists traveling in the basements from one big casino to another (trying to stay away from the storm outside). Its reminiscent of the group in The Poseidon Adventure where they traveled through the unseen innards of the vessel. In regards to the gargantuan sand storm and peripheral menaces, like a deadly cobra and an escaped tiger, the producers could only do so much with a TV budget. All things considered, the CGI storm looks fine, as does the cobra, but the tiger looks too fake. Yet this is somewhat expected in a flick of this ilk.

Beyond the setting and MOTW, its the story, characters, suspense and subtext (mindfood) where a movie like this stands or falls. The plots good but the group of protagonists needed something. Frankie Muniz works surprisingly well as the unlikely hero, as does Barry Bostwick as his amusing supposed-mentor, a Vegas lounge lizard. The females, however, are weak, except for Maggie Castle as the non-heros potential frumpy babe. The cast desperately needed someone like Cerina Vincent in Sasquatch Mountain (2006), Erin Karpluk in Wyvern (2009), Cindy Busby in Behemoth (2011) or Rebekah Kochan in Flu Bird Horror (2008).

As for suspense, it was okay. One sequence in particular was effective, the one involving Steven Schub as a working class thug, resentful of the rich kids who vacationed in Vegas. But suspense is created as much by the rising tensions between group members as the threat of the MOTW and this is the movies weak point. The same with the subtext, which amounts to (A.) don't fool with ancient Egyptian magic (rolling my eyes) and (B.) even a likable runt can get the right babe if he plays his cards right. The second is good stuff, but its not meaty enough to sustain a movie. As such, despite the numerous exciting things going on, Blast Vegas is curiously boring and isn't worth mentioning in the same breath as those four Syfy flicks noted above (take that as you will). However, its still worth catching if any of the aforementioned positives trip your trigger.

The film runs 86 minutes and was shot in Indio, California (and, presumably, Las Vegas, at least establishing shots).

8634752,3,B00HRD0FHQ,"This is a made for US TV. The sword of Thutmose III (The Napoleon of Egypt) is taken by some college kids and placed in the ground by a Vegas pool. This sets off a series of attacks on the city, mostly by a sand snake twister. A small group has figured what what it takes to stop the attacks and goes about the task.

The film was designed to be campy, but was no ""Sharknado."" Barry Bostwick plays Sal, an overly stereo-typical Vegas has-been piano player. He thanks a single person clapping and plugs his album on sale in the casino lobby. An Elvis impersonator asks Olive (Maggie Castle) if she has seen Elvis 68. ""He has left the building.""  While this is not knee slapping humor it is typical of what is going on in the film.

With other and better disaster films out there, I can't see wasting time on this one, now on a multi-pack of 12 films.",1454889600,,849,4.228395061728395

8634755,2,B00HRD0FHQ,"Hmmm...well, the plot had some potential merit (which is why I gave the rating a 2 instead of 1), but the writing was sub-par for what I would expect Frankie Muniz to be a part of.  It was all a bit cheesy and stupid.

The characters make the dumbest choices for the dumbest reasons.  Too much ""over the top"" sensationalism combined with unbelievable circumstances and resulting reactions and dialogue just didn't make for a good film.",1403049600,3,435,4.697368421052632

Can this be corrected in time or will we be subject to lions tigers and bears ""oh my?"" Watch and see.

One of the better disaster movies. If there's a clich&eacute; out there that it forgot to include that was an accident. They miss their opportunity to change olives and olive oil.",1389312000,3,532,4.373737373737374
