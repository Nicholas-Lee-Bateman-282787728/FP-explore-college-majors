8651877,5,B0013FID4G,"I bought this DVD after seeing it on the history channel. I use it with a class of high school students to teach background for French. Great for understanding some of the engineering achievements of the past. Many of these students will travel to France to see the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, the fountains of Versailles, and this is an informative introduction for that experience.",1277078400,,386,4.863636363636363
