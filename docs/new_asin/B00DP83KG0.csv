8595792,5,B00DP83KG0,"This rare PRC movie was so good it was released by a major movie company. It's one of the best
movies that shows how evil the Nazis were and what the did to many during WWII before the US
got involved in the war. John Carradine is great as Heydrich SS commander even though he's
mostly known from his Universal horror films you'll hardly know it's him. It's the true story of how
the Nazis took over a village and after Heydrich kills a priest he ambushed on a road and dies in
a hospital from his wounds. The Nazis take revenge by killing all the boys and men and a few
women and children but most were sent to concentration camps then the village was burned to
the ground! It still stands untouched after all these years as a memorial for those who died. It
is one of the best Nazis WWII movies ever made and a must see for all Americans.",1399593600,4,840,4.159509202453988
