2692816,5,B000KJU13C,"When taken together, these two films are remarkably engaging.  Some will prefer the earlier version with Ronald Coleman and Madeleine Carroll.  The role of villain played by Douglans Fairbanks, Jr. in this version is delightful.  The strong supporting case includes Raymond Massey, Mary Astor and David Niven.

The 1952 remake is a flashy technicolor version with Stewart Granger in the swashbuckling role as the king's double.  Granger is always fun to watch. James Mason does a fine job as the villain while Deborah Kerr is okay as the love interest, but not as appealing as Madeleine Carroll in the first version.",1178928000,,616,5.0594059405940595
2692817,5,B000KJU13C,"The reason to buy this DVD is the 1937 version of The Prisoner of Zenda.  A DVD of the great Ronald Colman is always a cause for celebration -- and in this one, you get two performances by him in a double role.  The supporting cast is top notch -- Mary Astor, David Niven, C. Aubrey Smith and young Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. almost stealing the show.  Deborah Kerr who plays the princess in the 1952 version is doubtless a better actress than Madeleine Carroll from the earlier version, but the gracious Miss Carroll was born to play royalty.  A great swashbuckler and a classic from the Golden Age of Cinema.",1178928000,2,606,4.4818181818181815
2692818,5,B000KJU13C,"The 1937 version is much to be preferred. It has style of its own, typical of the period, when microphones were feeble and actors had to 'stand and deliver', which in turn determined their style of acting.

The authority of Ronald Coleman and C Aubrey Smith shines through in a

way that Grainger & co., for all their talents, never managed to achieve with essentially the same shooting script.",1178841600,,394,4.695652173913044

2692821,5,B000KJU13C,"Both version of this costume drama are good.  The 1937 version is the better of the two with Ronald Coleman against the evil Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.  This well made is excellent from cast through production.  The 1952 version is also very good on its own, but will fade in comparison to the previous one.  The production is very good, but it is basically a scene for scene remake of the 1937 film.",1173398400,,396,4.458333333333333
2692822,5,B000KJU13C,"Fans of The Prisoner of Zenda continue to debate -- and even argue vehemently -- about which is better, the classic black and white 1937 version or the 1952 remake in glorious Technicolor. Yes, the earlier version starred the great Ronald Colman, but Stewart Granger does a very creditable job in the remake which also has the gorgeous Deborah Kerr in splendid color plus James Mason at his best. Good news: you don't have to choose between these two classic films, this set presents both. Please do yourself a favor and buy this set; you're sure to enjoy one of these versions and quite possibly both versions -- The Prisoner of Zenda is that good.",1172620800,32,649,4.6521739130434785
2692823,4,B000KJU13C,"When a British subject, Rudolf Rassendyll (Stewart Granger) arrives to Ruritania, in a fishing trip, he was ignoring that he is a replica of the man who would be king...

He was also surprised to find out that Rudolf V will be betrayed by two enemies: his half-brother Michael, Duke of Strelsau (Robert Douglas) who dreams to be the future sovereign, and by the impertinent, ambitious Officer Rupert of Hentzau (James Mason) who wishes to be the first man in the Kingdom...

Michael, after drugging the King, wants the Crown to be offered to him by the people... He poses as their savior from the excesses of an incompetent King...

But two faithful Officers, Colonel Zapt (Louis Calhern) and Lieutenant Fritz von Tarlenhein (Robert Coote), actively in favor of 'crowning the King,' persuade the 'Englishman on holiday' to substitute the 'twin cousin' and to stand assuming the position of a true king at his Coronation...

Rossendyll discovers himself involved in a tensional political web as well as in a strange human sensation...

He couldn't play the impostor after meeting Princess Flavia (Deborah Kerr). He couldn't care about the king and the crown anymore... Only her! He instantly falls in love with the young princess... And his love was more than truth or life or honor...

Flavia didn't either understand 'why' the King is so different... She never liked the King... She didn't love the King... Why, since the coronation, everything seems so different? Rudolf was so serious, so impartial, so indifferent... Now, so careful, so concerned, so in love...

After the success of ""Scaramouche,"" Stewart Granger performs with dignity the king part in ""Prisoner of Zenda."" He plays with certain charm the innocent hero, the swordsman, the perfect English gentleman in love... He proves to be 'the finest Elphberg of them all.' Granger will be always remembered as the handsome elegant actor of them all...

Deborah Kerr, who worked with Granger in ""King Solomon's Mines,"" is exquisite as the delicate, sensitive princess, 'born to her cares and duties.' Her honor lies in keeping faith with her country and her house...

Jane Greer plays the French Lady madly in love with Michael... Her only care was 'no harm' to her lover...

""The Prisoner of Zenda"" has all the elements of a highly romantic costumed adventure: secret plots; confused courts; honor; power; fame; duty; bravery; flirt; passion; love; hate; and swordsplay...

Filmed in Technicolor, the film is a beautiful exact remake of the 1937 Version with Ronald Colman, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Madeleine Carroll and Raymond Massey...",1168473600,9,2596,5.099056603773585
2692824,5,B000KJU13C,"""The Prisoner of Zenda"", based on the first of Anthony Hope's 'Zenda' novels, has been filmed at least six times since 1913, but the first two 'sound' versions, from 1937 and 1952, are the most popular versions of this timeless tale...and having them, packaged together, at LAST on video, is a cause to celebrate!

The story is simple, and has been done many times before; a drugged and kidnapped monarch-to-be must be impersonated by look-alike at the coronation, lest his kingdom fall into ruin at the hands of an evil half-brother!

The David O. Selznick-produced 1937 version offers the immortal Ronald Colman in the dual role of Rudolf, European crown prince, and Rudolf Rassendyll, his look-alike British cousin, end product of a brief affair of an ancestor; the radiant Madeleine Carroll is the royal betrothed, who falls in love with the pretender; Raymond Massey portrays Black Michael, Rudolf's scheming half-brother; and, best of all, a youthful Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., son of silent Hollywood's greatest swashbuckler (and a pretty fair swashbuckler, himself), is the definitive Rupert of Hentzau, the suavely villainous ally of Michael.

In the hands of this PERFECT cast (with terrific support by C. Aubrey Smith, a young David Niven, and Mary Astor) ""Zenda"" becomes a stylish tale of love, intrigue, and derring-do. High points include an astonishingly beautiful Royal Ball, where Colman and Carroll reveal their love; a very funny yet menacing meeting between Colman and Fairbanks, as they discuss the real King's potential fate; and best of all, a MAGNIFICENT climactic swordfight between the pair, as they lunge and parry furiously through the halls of a castle, while exchanging quips and one-liners about a British education!

MGM, in their 1952 remake, tried to surpass the earlier version by creating a technicolor 'scene-for-scene' duplicate of the film, utilizing some of their biggest stars, and reworking Alfred Newman's original musical score. The end result, however, was a mixed bag...

Stewart Granger, MGM's resident 50s swashbuckler, certainly was more athletic than Colman, but lacked the older actor's panache, and more importantly, 'The Voice', that distinctive, oft-imitated but never duplicated speaking voice that made Ronald Colman so unique. While Deborah Kerr was as regally beautiful as Madeleine Carroll, she lacked Carroll's fragile quality, which made the doomed love so heartbreaking. Robert Douglas was excellent as Black Michael, but James Mason, as Rupert of Hentzau, was miscast in the role. While a brilliant actor, Mason was too old, and actually TOO villainous! While Rupert is jaded and unscrupulous, he also has to be such a young, likable scoundrel that his escape, after the climactic duel, disappoints no one, not even the hero he nearly defeats, which ideally suited the cocky, younger Fairbanks. Seeing a malevolent Mason escape 'justice' seems unfair!

David Niven, in his autobiography, said he thought MGM's remake was a ridiculous idea, and that he was pleased that the newer production, even as a scene-for-scene copy, failed. While I think he was, perhaps, too hard on the Granger film, which is still entertaining, I have to agree that it doesn't even come close to the magic of Ronald Colman's 1937 classic!

But better yet, potential buyer...At this terrific price, you can judge for yourself!",1168300800,96,3361,5.282771535580524
2692825,5,B000KJU13C,"I am a huge fan of epics/adventure films...thing like Indiana Jones, Lawrence of Arabia, Gladiator, Ben-Hur, Lord of the Rings...and I have been waiting for this DVD for years!

The 1937 version of ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" is one of my favorite films ever...it's one of the very few movies that both generations of my family enjoy.  A splendid story with fairly good action scenes, witty dialogue, and a nobility behind the events and characters which manages to escape being corny or archaic.  The characters are cast to perfection (Douglas Faribanks Jr. IS Rupert of Hentzau--this is, essentially, his defining role) and most of the actors would continue to play roles with similar personalities throughout their careers.  The coronation scene (using Handel's ""See Now the Conq'ring Hero Comes"" from Judas Maccabaeus) is particularly notable.

The 50's version is almost a scene-for-scene remake, but with inferior actors, totally fake-looking sets (truly idiotic...Brigadoon-esque), and absurd 'humorous' additions to the script sprinkled throughout.

Buy this for the original film; the set is still worth it.

I just assumed it was with Ronald Coleman and when I saw Steward Granger's name I was a little disappointed until I watched the movie.  It made me take a second look at Stewart Granger and what an excellent actor he is.  He is so natural and real and does this role with a sense of humor and a gleam in his eye. He does his own sword fighting and I understand he does all of his own stunts.  Not only is he exceptionally handsome, but there is a charm about him that draws you to him.  I thoroughly enjoyed this move so much so that I have become a big fan of his and have since bought 5 more of his movies.

2692878,4,B000KJU13C,"The original Anthony Hope novel on which these movies were based was the founding father of a string of ""Ruritanian romances""--swashbuckling adventure tales of, usually, an Englishman or American who finds himself in a picturesque European kingdom somewhere within a day's train travel from Paris, and gets involved in intrigues, usually falling in love with a princess or noblewoman by the way.  It's been filmed in two classic versions--one with Ronald Colman in the leading dual role, the other, 15 years later and in lush, vivid Technicolor, with Stewart Granger, but both with virtually identical scripts.  (There was another movie in 1979, and a mini-series in 1984.)  In 1897, Englishman Rudolf Rassendyll (Colman/Granger), a retired officer in Her Majesty's service and member of a noble family, travels to Ruritania for some trout-fishing, wanders onto the royal game preserve in the province of Zenda, and there is discovered by Col. Zapt (C. Aubrey Smith/Louis Calhern) and Capt. Fritz von Tarlenheim (David Niven/Robert Coote), military attaches to King Rudolf V, who is about to be crowned in the capitol city of Strelsau.  Thanks to an affair between Rassendyll's great-great-great-grandmother Amelia and their mutual great-great-great-grandfather Rudolf III, the two men are not only fifth cousins but virtually identical--which proves to be fortuitous, for the King's wine is drugged that night and in the morning he's still out like the well-known light.  If he doesn't appear for the coronation, his jealous half-brother, Prince Michael, Duke of Strelsau (Raymond Massey/Robert Douglas), will proclaim himself Regent, set the King's cousin, betrothed bride, and heir apparent Princess Flavia (Madeleine Carroll/Deborah Kerr) on the throne as Queen, and then force her to marry him so he can sit on the throne.  If Rassendyll will consent to pose as the king, however--just for 24 hours or so, till the drug wears off--Michael can be confounded.  Reluctantly, he agrees--only to find that when Flavia presents herself to swear homage to him, he falls in love at first sight.  Then, when he and Zapt return to the King's hunting lodge, they find that he's been abducted.  Unexpected help comes from Antoinette deMauban (Mary Astor/Jane Greer), Michael's mistress, who knows that if he marries Flavia she'll never have him, and is willing to go into exile with him if it will save his life.  But the king is imprisoned in the fortresslike castle of Zenda, stronghold of Rupert, Baron Hentzau (Douglas Fairbanks Jr./James Mason), who has an agenda of his own.  And will Rudolf be willing to rescue him if it means losing Flavia?

Rassendyll's and Flavia's love (""I love you now with all my heart,"" she says, ""when I never even liked you before"") always seems rather implausible to me, but the intrigues of the story, the twists and quick action, make it enjoyable simply as adventure, and in that spirit I can recommend it.  It's also, like almost all pre-1970 movies, a good family flick and may even provide talking points about love and duty.",1441411200,2,3059,5.155555555555556

2692880,5,B000KJU13C,"As far as Myself is concern ,both movies are excellent. I know Stewart  Granger from many outstanding movies like , the Man in Greay, Madonna of the seven moons, King Solomon Mines, Scaramouche , Young Bess, All the brothers were valiant and many more. Deborah Kerr , from  An affair to Remember, Quo Vadis just to mention two, also some movies with James Mason. On the other hand Roland Collman is completely new to me. The only thing I know that he made few silent movies with actress Vilma Banky known to me from to movies with Rudolph Valentino.
I have never heard of Aubrey Smith and Madelaine Carrol , but I know David Niven and above all Douglas Fairbanks Jr.  From the movie ,Corsican Brothers. From watching more movies several times ,and trying to be impartial as much as possible , I came to following conclusion: Both Movies are excellent: Stewart Granger is just as good actor as Roland Collman. Both actors are very convincing in their roles. The difference in Granger 's favor is , that he looks much younger  ,more handsome and dashing. Both actresses Deborah Kerr and Madelaine
Caroll are equally beautiful in their roles and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Has definite edge over James Mason. It is almost impossible to decide between Aubry Smith and Louis Calhern. Actres Mary Astor whom I know from one of the greatest criminal movies,The Maltes Falcon and Advanture in Panama , both with Humprey Bogard is more beautiful and skilled performer than Jane Greer .

2692910,5,B000KJU13C,Ireally superb high romantic adveenture. Stewart Granger  was the more dashing Rudolph Rassendell. Great direction and production! I really enjoyed both.,1409011200,,153,6.285714285714286

2692912,5,B000KJU13C,I have seen both versions more than 30 times and each time is like watching as if it was the first. Both versions are classics.,1403827200,,127,4.12
2692913,3,B000KJU13C,The print of the 1937 Zenda was quite poor and it makes this beautiful movie look far less glamorous and wonderful. A disappointment.,1403740800,,133,4.826086956521739
2692914,5,B000KJU13C,"Purchased solely for the 1937 version which is the  acknowledged masterpiece - the 1952 version is awful as so many remakes are.  I am a huge Ronald Colman fan and he is wonderful in this film; the supporting cast is tremendous as well.  Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. nearly steals the film.",1402963200,,284,4.64

2692916,5,B000KJU13C,"The novel is fascinating, and it is interesting to compare it with the film versions, both of which are excellent.  I had read somewhere that the 1952 version is almost a scene by scene copy of the 1937, and it was interesting to see how far this was true.  The fight sequence near the end of both films is well worth watching, with the 1952 version being the best in my opinion.",1397347200,,379,4.25
2692917,1,B000KJU13C,"Definition, color, sound we're far below VHS version  Sub titles were so inaccurate they were funny.  This version is not recommended.",1397088000,2,134,5.333333333333333
2692918,3,B000KJU13C,I only wanted the 1937 version but I couldn't find it on DVD. I compromised and bought this version. I don't know if the 1952 version is any good or worth watching because I haven't viewed it. I've viewed the 1937 version a couple of times and found each viewing was just as rewarding as the first.,1396051200,,298,4.245614035087719
2692919,5,B000KJU13C,"This DVD is a must have for your classics collection.  You may know, that Hollywood used the same script and sets for both productions.  Stuart Granger is not the wonderful Ronald Coleman, but carries the day.  The collection would be worth having just to see Deborah Kerr look and sound fabulous.",1395878400,,297,4.784313725490196
2692920,5,B000KJU13C,Ronald Coleman is amazing in the dual part. The 1937 version lets the cast portray the depth of the characters. With a limited amount of what today we would call special effects. If you watch these two back to back (which I did) you will see that the 1952 version is almost a word for word copy of the '37 version. Which is sad since the color and actors seem to pale in comparison with the same script.,1395014400,,403,4.17948717948718
2692921,3,B000KJU13C,"On its own the 1937 Zenda would have to command four stars for those who remember 1930s attitudes and acting. Ronald Coleman, of course,  dominates with his portrayal of an English gentleman who also happens to be a superb fencer, but Douglas Fairbanks jr almost steals the picture as the devil may care villain Rupert of Hentzau. The 1952 is much inferior - many of the scenes are almost replicas of the 1937 .film and the characters don't convince. Perhaps we were too sophisticated by 1952 and traditional English gentlemen were a dying breed.",1390694400,2,546,4.808510638297872
2692922,5,B000KJU13C,"I love this movie, in both versions.  Of Course Ronald Coleman is a tough act to follow, but Stewart Granger does a great job also.  I was thrilled to get this.",1386892800,,160,4.129032258064516
2692923,5,B000KJU13C,"The true jewel here -- the 1937 Ronald Colman version -- could use a first rate restoration and blu ray treatment (Criterion... please, help us out.). However, this edition will serve until we are blessed with such a restoration. Quite possibly the best romantic adventure movie ever made, the Colman version reflects the essence of a ""Hollywood production"" from its golden age; a masterpiece reflecting the best acting, art direction, writing, and cinematography (James Wong Howe) of the era. Seeing this film once is not enough. A true student of cinema... and life... will find it necessary to view this film at least several times each year...  throughout their lifetime.",1385164800,,675,5.136363636363637
2692924,4,B000KJU13C,"I love watching these two versions of the same story, back-to-back. The fact that the scrips are nearly identical and even the scenes almost exactly the same makes it such great fun to try to decide which I like better. Probably the 1937 version...no wait, maybe the other one.... Just a great, make believe story.",1385078400,,314,4.7272727272727275
2692925,4,B000KJU13C,"Both the 1937 version and its almost identical 1952 remake (funny, considering what the story is about!), are enjoyable storybook adventures with suspense, swordplay, and love; they each have their strengths and weaknesses.

The '37 version feels like Ronald Colman's picture since he steals virtually every scene. He is surrounded by a cast of good supporting players, C. Aubrey Smith and a young David Niven. Stewart Granger does an adequate job in the '52 version, but is somewhat wooden as compared with Colman.

By contrast, the '52 version feels like Deborah Kerr's picture as her performance of Princess Flavia dazzles. I prefer Kerr's performance to Madeleine Carroll's, and the '52 remake is worth watching for Kerr alone.",1382400000,,731,5.239316239316239

2692927,5,B000KJU13C,"Saw the 1952 version first many years ago - then the 1937 film.  While it has been said that Ronald Colman's performance is better, I prefer Stewart Granger - and James Mason steals the film!",1379289600,,191,4.457142857142857

2692929,5,B000KJU13C,"The 1937version is the real treasure here.  The cast simply cannot be beat, and even though it was made all those years ago it simply can't be replaced.",1375401600,,152,4.428571428571429
2692930,5,B000KJU13C,Both version were well done and the stories excellent.  The 1952 version was made in color and the director shot scene by scene as the eariler adaption.  Stewart Granger and James Mason's swordplay is delight to watch.,1375142400,,218,4.864864864864865
2692931,5,B000KJU13C,"It's sad that most younger viewers don't know who Ronald Colman was, but in his 1930s heyday he was one of the biggest leading men in Hollywood, and certainly the most elegant.  His version of The Prisoner of Zenda is the definitive telling of this classic story.  Superb supporting performances by C. Aubrey Smith, Raymond Massey, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and a very young David Niven.",1374019200,,383,4.876923076923077
2692932,5,B000KJU13C,"I enjoyed both of these films, but particularly the 1952 version with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr.  The uniforms were outstanding, and the classic story line still works.  It's a shame nobody ever filmed the sequel.",1374019200,,220,5.083333333333333

2692937,5,B000KJU13C,"As a teenager I found a tattered copy of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA at a tag sale and finished it in one reading.  A favorite I re-read over the years, so I was delighted to see both of these versions - can't decide which is better, so usually flip a coin and settle down for a good popcorn evening.  Just combination of romance and adventure from a century or more ago.",1368576000,,365,4.126760563380282
2692938,3,B000KJU13C,"The 1937 Prisoner of Zenda is a classic if there ever was one:  perfectly cast, acted with zest, with admirable sets, costumes and cinematography, this story of Central European aristocratic intrigue is one of the great triumphs of Hollywood romantic swashbucklers.  This is a film that everyone of every age will find delightful.  Unfortunately, this wonderful movie is ill served by the Warners DVD set (which also includes the inferior 1953 remake), which uses a poor transfer of a poor print.  Five stars for the movie certainly, and since this seems to be the only region 1 DVD available, you might as well watch it; it's better than not seeing the film at all.  But this film cries out for a properly remastered DVD made from a good archival print, to which I'd certainly give five stars.  The set also includes some shorts and cartoons which are interesting as period pieces.",1368489600,6,882,4.80794701986755

2692940,4,B000KJU13C,"I had never seen the Ronald Coleman version.  Frankly, I thought he looked too old but his acting and presence made up for it.  Madeline Carroll on the other hand was exquisite in her role. Regarding the younger version with Granger and crew -  I don't deny I enjoy a Stewart Granger film and the sword play between Granger and Mason was superior.

Douglas Fairbanks in the older version and Stewart Granger in the color film.  The films are reminiscent of the Errol Flynn movies (Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, and The Adventures of Robin Hood) and Scaramouche movie of Stewart Granger.

2692947,5,B000KJU13C,"In an imagined, unidentified Balkan nation, in the province of Zenda, English commoner Rudolf Rassendyl (Ronald Colman) arrives on a fishing holiday, never mind that his expedition coincides with an impending coronation. And yet soon enough Rassendyl finds himself steeped in deadly court intrigue, swapping hook, line, and sinker for crown and scepter. An ancestral commonality has lent Rassendyl and the soon-to-be-crowned Rudolph V the same face. And when the wine-swilling Rudolph V swills too much wine - the last drops of which were drugged - and collapses in a stupor, Rassendyl reluctantly impersonates him for the coronation. ""After all,"" he reasons, ""It would only be for a day, wouldn't it?"" Except that the visiting Englishman never does make it back to fishing.

When Rudolph V's ambitious older half-brother, Black Michael (Raymond Massey), gets wind of the masquerade, things evolve to a taut stand-off. With the rightful king abducted and imprisoned, Rassendyl is forced to carry on the deception. In his guise as monarch, he falls in love with the beautiful Princess Flavia (Madeleine Carroll), King Rudolph's intended bride, and she with him. And so now will even this honorable Englishman be content to serve as only a place holder?

THE PRISONER OF ZENDA, this 1937 version, remains the definitive adaptation of Anthony Hope's classic 1894 novel. Pat the backs of them what contributed to the sparkling screenplay and the lush cinematography and the exquisite set and costume designs... but this is Ronald Colman's vehicle thru and thru. Ronald Colman, lest you forget, is one of cinema's greatest romantic leading men. And while LOST HORIZON and A TALE OF TWO CITIES portrayed him as the ideal gentleman hero and RAFFLES and BULLDOG DRUMMOND added a rakish element, it was THE PRISONER OF ZENDA that injected massive swashbuckling swagger to Colman's image. He would follow up this role with a fantastic swashbuckling take on the French poet-vagabond Franois Villon in IF I WERE KING, which is my all-time favorite Colman film.

THE PRISONER OF ZENDA carries the banner for those grand, old-school-tie adventures in which attributes such as honor, bravery, and self-sacrifice are plonked on pedestals and revered. It is a sweeping romance in all senses of the word. Colman's sublime performance drives the film. He effortlessly inhabits the noble and witty Rudolf Rassendyl. And I never tire of his mellifluous delivery of dialogue.

And yet if anyone comes close to one-upping Colman, it's Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. who had to be convinced by his legendary father to take the role of the blackhearted but devilishly charming Count Rupert of Hentzau. I think it's his finest, most sly performance, and he ends up overshadowing Raymond Massey. Some of the best bits in the film unfold during the scenes wherein Colman and Fairbanks interact and banter and, in the third act, engage in a splendid fencing duel. I knew Fairbanks was on to something when Count Rupert met Rassendyl for the first time and his cheerful remark - ""Ah, the play actor!"" - rang out, to the consternation of Rassendyl's fellow conspirators. THE PRISONER OF ZENDA would revive Fairbanks, Jr.'s flagging career. THE PRISONER OF ZENDA would also kick off a young David Niven's career and land the imposing C. Aubrey Smith yet another growly military part. 75 years later, THE PRISONER OF ZENDA still intrigues and rouses and delights. The premise can't be knocked: to save a king's throne, a commoner must impersonate him. What young-at-heart movie audience wouldn't swap the anemic activity of fishing for that?

THE PRISONER OF ZENDA would be remade - shot for shot, score for score, script for script - in 1952 and would star Stewart Granger. See it if you're a Granger fan and also a masochist. Because Ronald Colman blows him out of the water, sends him packing, perhaps to fish.",1353283200,5,3872,5.081761006289308
2692948,5,B000KJU13C,"The Prisoner of Zenda has been done many times but these are the 2 best versions! I particularly like the 1952 Stewart Granger version! Love, dual identiies, intrigue...what's not to like?",1341273600,,188,5.096774193548387
2692949,3,B000KJU13C,"If you are buying this set, I suggest you do not spoil the memory of the 1937 version (4/5) by then watching the 1952 clone (1/5). The original film is certainly cheesy but there is enough gusto in the performances and the directorial touch of John Cromwell (watch out for the cavalry charge across the moat) to carry it off as entertainment. All the main players do well, though I especially liked Madeleine Carroll and Raymond Massey. The 1952 film is extraordinary for one thing only -- it copies, frame for frame, the original (as far as I was prepared to watch, which was the first 15-20 minutes), only altering the script by removing a line here and there. This is not a remake, it is a shameless copy (made presumably for audiences that would no longer pay to watch black and white in the new era of colour). The colour here, in fact, looks off and so does much else about the production. The cast, on paper, looks good, but I found Stewart Granger so unsatisfactory his performance contributed to my switching off before Deborah Kerr's entry. Whatever skill she might have brought to the part, nothing worthwhile is possible if an actor is required to give an imitation performance -- which is what the producer and director of the 1952 film required.",1324512000,2,1259,4.625
2692950,5,B000KJU13C,"Two versions of this for the price of one must be good value, and so they are. Like most people of my generation, I prefer the Ronald Coleman, but not by much, I have to say. The Granger remake is almost shot-for-shot/line-for-line, and loses nothing for that; it's also in colour which does satisfy certainly.  But for me, Aubrey Smith is unbeatable as the General, Fairbanks similarly as Rupert, and I'm afraid I simply cannot find anything physically desirable about Deborah Kerr whatever she's in, so her version of the Countess just doesn't begin to entice me. I do like James Mason as Rupert but just not quite as much as I do Fairbanks. All in all, a great double bill and as satisfying a tale of derring-do as you could ever hope to see.",1317513600,,745,4.518518518518518
2692951,5,B000KJU13C,I knew the 1952 version was a remake of the 1937 film. I saw the 1952 version first and fell in love with it. I'm sure had I seen the 1937 version  first that would be my favorite also. Both are wonderful. It's like seeing a gothic novel.,1310256000,,238,3.9583333333333335
2692952,5,B000KJU13C,"The Prisoner of Zenda boasts an all star cast with Ronald Coleman, Madeline Carroll, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Mary Astor, Raymond Massey, David Niven, and  C. Aubrey Smith. It was based on the 1894 Anthony Hope novel of the same name. Previous films include Edwin Porter's 1913 version and the 1922 version with Ramon Navarro.

The film appeared in 1937 as there was considerable interest in royalty and coronations due to the abdication of Edward VIII and the ascendency to the throne of King George VI of England.

Handsome Ronald Coleman (1891-1958) has a dual part as an Englishman and the King Apparent of a small European country.  Coleman was a silent film actor whose rich, melodious voice propelled him to stardom when talkies came out. He was Oscar nominated for two films in one year - 1929 (""Bulldog Drummond"" and Condemned""), and again in 1942 (""Random Harvest"") and finally won in 1947 (""A Double Life""), for which he also won the Golden Globe.

FWIW - Coleman also appeared in ""A Tale of Two Cities"" in which mistaken identity also played a major plot point.

Beautiful Madeline Carroll (1906-87) plays Coleman's love interest. She is best known for her films with Hitchcock (""The 39 Steps"", ""Secret Agent"") which won her a contract in the U.S. making films like ""Northwest Mounted Police"" (1940) and ""Safari"" (1940). Later in life she claimed this was her favorite role.

The great Raymond Massey (1896-1983) plays the evil Black Michael, Coleman's brother who wants the throne for himself. Massey is best remembered for his roles as Lincoln in ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" (1940), ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" (1950) and  ""How the West Was Won"" (1962). On TV he played Dr. Gillespie in the series ""Dr Kildare"" (1961-5). He made nearly 100 films. I remember him best for his over the top portrayal of John Brown in ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940). Prior to playing Lincoln, most of his roles were villainous (e.g., Philip of Spain in ""Fire Over England"", Prince Ghul in ""The Drum""), as he is here, and his great performances are why.

FWIW - Massey originally had problems playing Black Michael and sought advice from C. Aubrey Smith who told him that everyone has problems playing Black Michael. With that Massey relaxed and went on to give a great performance.

David Niven (1910-83) plays an ally of Coleman. Niven won an Oscar for ""Separate Tables"" (1959) and a Golden Globe for ""The Moon is Blue"" (1953), but he's probably best known for his role as Phileas Fogg in ""Around the World in 80 Days"" (1956).

FWIW - Massey and Niven died on the same day - July 29, 1983.

Mary Astor (1906-1987) is in love with Massey but having an affair with Fairbanks.  Astor is best remembered as Mrs. O'Shaughnessy from ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), although she won the Oscar for her role in ""The Great Lie"" which appeared the same year and is now mostly forgotten. Astor made more than 100 films from 1921 to 1964 (""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"") and was a major star in the silent era. Astor does her usual good job.

C. Aubrey Smith (1863-1948) plays Colonel Zapt, an ally of Coleman. Smith was a great actor known for his roles as an aristocrat. He appeared in more than 100 films from 1915 to 1949. He gave us memorable roles in a host of films, including Major Hamilton in ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935) and Lord Capulet in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936). I remember him best as Col. Williams in ""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937) with Shirley Temple.

Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (1909-2000) plays Rupert, an ally of Massey. Fairbanks' father had been one of the top stars of the silent era (""Robin Hood"", ""Mask of Zorro"", ""Thief of Bagdad"" etc.) so Junior began working early. He claimed - ""I never tried to emulate my father. Anyone trying to do that would be a second-rate carbon copy.""He did a lot of relatively undistinguished work in nearly 100 films, but he is absolutely charming in this film as he would be in 1939's ""Gunga Din"".

FWIW - Fairbanks wanted the Coleman role, but when he was turned down for it, his father urged him to take the role of Rupert, which was by far a better role although it meant Fairbanks would be billed third. Fairbanks Sr. said ""Rupert of Hentzau is probably one of the best villains ever written. He is witty, irresistible, and as sly as Iago... Nobody has ever played Rupert and failed to steal the show, on either stage or screen. It is so actor-proof, in fact, that Rin Tin Tin could play the part and walk away with it! C. Aubrey Smith told him ""I have played every part in this drama except Lady Flavia, and I can tell you that nobody ever damaged their career by playing Rupert of Hentzau.""

John Cromwell (1887-1979) was the original director. He had problems with nearly all the actors, especially the men, and eventually producer Selznick called in Woody van Dyke and George Cukor. Cromwell made nearly 50 films from 1929 to 1961, but he was particularly busy in the 30s when he made ""Tom Sawyer"" (1930), ""Of Human Bondage"" (1934),  and ""The Adventures of Marco Polo"" (1938). When not directing he was a busy actor, especially on Broadway where he won a Tony in 1952 for ""Point of No Return"".

Woody van Dyke (1889-1943) directed the action sequences which feature a very impressive dueling scene at the end. He is best known for his ""Thin Man"" films, for which he received an Oscar nomination in 1935. He also received a nomination for ""San Francisco"" (1936) and directed Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Macdonald in 6 of their films. Van Dyke enjoyed exotic locations and made such films as ""Heart of the Yukon"" (1927), ""White Shadows in the South Seas"" (1928), ""Eskimo"" (1933), ""Northwest Passage"" (1940) and ""Cairo"" (1942).

Music is by Alfred Newman. Newman received his first Oscar nomination for this film and was nominated more than 30 more times and won 9 times (""Alexander's Ragtime Band"", ""Tin Pan Alley"", ""Song of Bernadette"", ""Mother Wore Tights"", ""With a Song in My Heart"", ""Call me Madam"", ""Love is a Many Splendid Thing"", ""The King and I"", and ""Camelot""). Newman also scored the 1952 version of this film.

Cinematography is by James Wong Howe (1899-1976). Howe was nominated for an Oscar 10 times with 2 wins (""Hud"" and ""The Rose Tatoo"").  The split screen in which Coleman talks to himself has the added bonus of making it appear that Coleman actually shakes hands with himself. It is so well done the NY Times critic thought that a double was used.

1937 was a pretty meager year in films. The top grossing films were ""Snow White"", ""Saratoga"", ""One Hundred Men and a Girl"", ""Topper"", and ""Wee Willie Winkie"". The Oscars went to ""The Life of Emile Zola"" (Picture), ""The Awful Truth"" (Director), ""The Good Earth"" (Actress) and ""Captains Courageous"" (Actor). Other notable releases that year were ""Dead End"", ""The Prince and the Pauper"", the Marx Brothers ""A Day at the Races"", and ""A Star is Born"". Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland made their first film together (""Thoroughbreds Don't Cry"") and 17 year old Lana Turner appeared in ""They Won't Forget"" and became ""the Sweater girl"". Clark Gable and Myrna Loy were voted the King and Queen of Hollywood.

The film was redone in 1952 with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr and as a comedy in 1979 with Peter Sellers.

Other films about dual identities include James Whales' ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" (1939) with Louis Hayward in the dual role, ""A Tale of Two Cities""  (1935) with Ronald Coleman as Sydney Carlton and Donald Woods as Charles Darnay, and ""The Prince and the Pauper"" (1937) with Billy and Bobby Mauch playing the dual role. The Prince and the Pauper is from the 1881 Mark Twain novel, A Tale of Two Cities is from Dickens' 1859 novel, and The Man in the Iron Mask comes from the 1848 Alexander Dumas novel although it was earlier included in a 1771 article by Voltaire.

This is a classic film from the classic Hollywood era, with so many excellent actors it's amazing the film isn't seen more often.",1308873600,,7901,4.690028901734104

2692954,4,B000KJU13C,"The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 version) is of course a great film.  Everything about it is perfect -- I particularly love the fact that C. Aubrey Smith gets a big meaty part for a change and makes the most of it.  Raymond Massey, Doug Fairbanks, and Mary Astor overact all over the place.  Madeleine Carroll is sweet.  You can just wallow in this film, everyone being noble, or truly evil,  there's a trapdoor into the dark water below the castle, and great love and fight scenes.  What more do you want from a film?  And of course anything Ronald Colman is in is worth seeing: he has this on screen sensitivity that just radiates gentlemanly charm.

 But as another reviewer notes, the version on the DVD is not very good -- it is a grainy copy, not terrrible, but not from the original master.  Perhaps that has disappeared?

The later film is a waste of time (also a waste of Deborah Kerr), except that James Mason is delightfully creepy and having a great time (Doug Fairbanks is just devil-may-care), and the swordfight is quite fantastic.  The swordfight is the only thing that is different from the earlier film: it is hard to believe, but it is true, the second film is otherwise exactly the same script and virtually shot-by-shot (the same horsemen fall off the drawbridge, etc.).  Why would anyone do such a thing?  And Stewart Grainger is (was) something stuck in the 1950s:  he is sort of like a 1957 Chevy, all chrome with big hair.  One last little bonus for true film buffs is that Jane Greer appears -- she made so few films that it is a pleasure to suddenly see her in this thing.

It is a curious phenomenon, but now the black and white makes the first film work in a different way than when it was originally released:  it makes the whole thing feel like something a little antique and Eastern European before World War I (which is of course the point of Strelsau, etc.).  It makes it much easier to go into that little world than the colour version, which is shiny and technicolourish and actually a lot like Lichtenberg in Call Me Madam (I kept expecting Ethel Merman to make an entrance).

It has nothing of the elegant drama and charm of the Ronald Coleman version. I love the book and that version is at least faithful to it!

This version, however...the entire feel or it is just stupid. The king has a ridiculous lisp, and the actor is nothing like he should be.

The entire cast of the '37 version is much better suited for the story.

The performances are impeccable, though Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s Rupert of Hentzau almost steals the film, a dashingly charsimatic performance. Paired with it is the 1952 remake, clunkily directed by Richard Thorpe almost frame for frame, which is not a patch on its predecessor. But it's worth seeing for James Mason's Rupert.

Remember Ronald Colman in Lost Horizon (1937)? Well he made this movie in the same year.

For those of you who may have missed the story King Rudolf V, who is not the nicest person, is drugged out of the way. Because all Kings named Rudolf look like Ronald Colman, a vacationing Englishman, who happens to be a long lost cousin, he gets to substitute for the stability of the country and to foil the bad guys (his half-brother Michael, Duke of Strelsau (Raymond Massey) form taking over. See Raymond Massey again in Things to Come (1936).

2692964,5,B000KJU13C,"The Prisoner of Zenda 2 pack is a real treat for fans of the story & the films. Watching them side by side invites the inevitable comparisons and the 1952 version comes up way short. This is not a criticism of that film; rather it is an affirmation of how great the 1937 version is. The '52 entry is a shot-by-shot remake using the same script and much of
 the same score but filmed in color. The action sequences are beefed up and the climactic sword duel is well-staged and goes on forever. The critical difference in the films is not necessarily the casting but the performances. In general the actors in the '52 film seem very histrionic and overwrought in many scenes while the performers in the earlier version are more subtle, nuanced, and ultimately more effective. The only performer in the second film that is not up to snuff is Jane Greer as Antoinette, who is awful. Deborah Kerr is hard to take as the virginal Flavia while Madeleine Carroll in the '37 film looks like she stepped out of a storybook. Raymond Massey, no stranger to chewing scenery, is perfectly sinister & tragic in the '37 film while Robert Douglas is just evil and unlikeable in the later version. In the lead role of Rudolph Stewart Granger is suave and certainly athletic but has an overwrought edge in tense scenes that could have used a more tongue-in-cheek flair. Ronald Colman is nothing short of brilliant in the earlier film in one of his signature roles. Perhaps the biggest gap of performance effectiveness is the actors in the role of Rupert of Hentzua. James Mason is a brilliant actor but seems miscast and too old for the role; his attempts at being a suave lady-killer are laughable. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. is a complete joy in the '37 version. He is a laughing cavalier; certainly evil but a truly likeable rogue that we are happy to see escape in the end.
 Overall, I enjoyed the 1952 film but it suffers in comparison the 1937 classic. Ronald Colman was such a unique star, so suave and romantic, that the memory of him in the lead role lingers forever. The cast was perfect, the black-and-white photography lush, and the musical score both rousing and touching in appropriate spots. See this version first and the '52 copy won't stand a chance.",1215475200,4,2245,4.62406015037594

2692966,5,B000KJU13C,"David O. Selznick's 1937 version of Anthony Hope's oft-filmed and equally as oft-imitated warhorse The Prisoner of Zenda is often hailed as the best of many versions, and it's certainly a classic example of the genius of the Hollywood system in the Golden Age. With the plot so familiar even then - as with Gone With the Wind, Selznick was warned that the film would be a disaster, the producer betting successfully that the impending coronation of King Edward VII of Great Britain would create public interest for the Ruritanian romantic adventure - much of the strength is in the pitch perfect casting. Ronald Colman is a perfect Rudolf Rassendyl, charming, heroic and decent against all odds, the perfect gentleman but with a likeable sense of self-deprecating wit that keeps him from being remote or stuffy, though those are qualities that work against him as the uncrowned king a distant family scandal has left him the identical double of: he's not bad in his second role, but Colman never really did dissolute. Madeleine Carroll is the perfect princess and Mary Astor makes the most of the meatier role as the villain's mistress trying to save him (and her own place by his side) from his ambition. Raymond Massey's sneering looks and Old Testament disdain ensured that he never had to overexert himself to make a convincing villain as the illegitimate ""Black"" Michael, and he glowers splendidly here, though Douglas Fairbanks Jr. never quite gets the chances from the screenplay that he needs to outshine him as the more charismatically dastardly Rupert of Hentzau, something that would be corrected in MGM's1952 version. C. Aubrey Smith and a young David Niven also make an impression on the side of the angels.

Of course, producer David O. Selznick was as much of a star as any of his cast - even though more than ably directed by John Cromwell (alongside an uncredited George Cukor, who shot the lovers' final farewell scene, and W.S. Van Dyke II, who shot the final duel), there's no doubt that Selznick is the true auteur here. It's lavishly produced, with no expense spared design by Lyle Wheeler (albeit largely limited to exteriors: Selznick never had much of a backlot) and some attention-grabbling camerawork from James Wong Howe such as the long crane shot down a magnificent ceremonial staircase to a waiting reception, never letting the attention flag en route to the grand duel between Colman and Fairbanks Jr. It's never quite a match for the very best of Errol Flynn's swashbucklers (though Flynn would have made a better King than a Rassendyl), but 70 years on it still holds up as grand entertainment.

MGM's 1952 version of The Prisoner of Zenda is often dismissed as a shot-for-shot remake with nothing added but Technicolor, but while it does often closely follow the blueprint of the excellent 1937 Ronald Colman version it also improves on the screenplay to a surprising degree thanks to Noel Langley's script polish while offering at least one better action sequence. Rupert of Hentzau always had the best lines, but with James Mason in the part, the role is considerably expanded to particularly good effect, with Mason making the most of the charismatic villainy even if there's some rather obvious stunt doubling for him in the final swordfight. There's even the addition of a second scene between Stewart Granger's player king and Mason's charmingly untrustworthy rogue as befits Mason's star status, with Mason winning on points despite having the more ridiculous hairstyle. Not that Granger is any slouch here himself, at the height of his powers in the dual lead role and even allowing the real king a bit more dignity than usual too (though look out for the moment where Granger inadvertently reveals he's a pipe man offscreen when he has to light a cigarette!). While Louis Calhern isn't quite up to C. Aubrey Smith in the original as Colonel Zapt, the always likeable Robert Coote outshines David Niven in the earlier film as Fritz and Deborah Kerr makes for an excellent leading lady. Tremendous entertainment.

Although it's a shame that the originally announced 1922 silent version is not included on the DVD, but it still makes a good package: the 1937 version also includes a radio adaptation, the cartoon `The Wayward Pups and short film `Penny Wisdomn' while the 1952 includesa James Fitzpatrick travelog `Land of theTaj Mahal,' the Oscar-winning Tom and Jerry cartoon Johann Mouse and the original theatrical trailer.",1197763200,,4468,4.978580990629183
2692967,5,B000KJU13C,"Of all the great Hollywood swashbucklers the 1937 Prisoner of Zenda is the most sophisticated, the most adult - perhaps because it dares to have a downbeat ending.  The hero and heroine are three-dimensional grown-ups in a way that Warner's Robin and Marion aren't - love them though I may.
And, one has to marvel at the cast Selznick assembled.  There are seven memorable star turns here, all individually remarkable, and all playing together perfectly.  Ronald Coleman's patented rueful romantic lead here is every bit as good as his Sydney Carton in Tale of Two Cities, just funnier.  And Fairbanks Jr.'s turn as the smiling, scheming villain is still thrilling and just plain strange.  Was he ever anywhere near as good?
Everything about this picture works beautifully- it holds up much better than creaky fare like Grand Hotel.  I just wish the picture on this DVD were restored.
The 1952 version isn't as good, but is does serve up the irresistible plot well enough.  Stewart Granger is actually quite good; he just doesn't have Coleman's depth.  Other cast members are better actors than there predecessors (Deborah Kerr, James Mason); they're just not as perfect in their roles.  The film retains the same script and the same gorgeous score as the earlier version.  The only changes are that the climactic duel is much longer (clearly making extensive use of James Mason's double) and for some reason they left out the hero's rakish salute in the final shot.",1190592000,3,1466,4.9227642276422765

""The Prisoner of Zenda"" stars Ronald Colman as Rudolph Rassendyll.  Mr. Colman was one of the few movie actors to survive the transition to sound.  While many of his peers were found to have horrible speaking voice, Mr. Colman was blessed by the God.  His cultivated English accent is a joy to hear.  But I digress.

An English gentleman, Rudolph Rassendyll visits the country of Ruritania.  Initially he is confused by the stares of the natives.  He finds out why after meeting two loyal retainers of Crown Prince Rudolph, Captain von Tarlenheim (David Niven) and Colonel Zapt.  Mr. Rassendyll bears an extraordinary resemblance to the Crown Prince Rudolph.  Some generations before, a future King of Ruritania had an affair with the wife of an English Lord.  Once a generation, the Elphberg face had popped up in the Rassendyll line.

The political situation in Ruritania is precarious.  While Rudolph is to become King the next day, he has an older brother, Michael.  Due to a legal technicality, Rudolph has precedence to the throne.  However, Rudolph is viewed as a drunk and a wastrel by many of the subjects.  In some quarters Black Michael is more popular than Rudolph.

Prince Rudolph is drugged to ensure he doesn't make his coronation. A Crown Prince too drunk to make his own coronation will never be King.  At this point the movie really begins.  Mr. Rassendyll is persuaded (by Colonel Zapt) to replace his cousin at the coronation.  The forces of Black Michael led by right hand man, Count Rupert of Hentzau (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) kidnap the drugged King as Rudolph is crowned.

The maneuvering and intrigues by both sides are involved and complex.  The story is fast-paced and engaging.  There isn't a weak performance by any of the actors.  These are great professionals having the time of their lives.  The good guys are heroic.  The bad guys are oily and nefarious.  The women are passionate and loyal.

Douglas Fairbanks gives a stand-out performance as Count Rupert.  His Count Rupert is a charming sociopath so smooth he'd be your best friend right up to the point he stuck a knife in your ribs with a smile on his face.  Like his father Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. does his own stunts.  The man was a superb athlete.  He had considerable acting skills to match his eye-hand coordination.

This has to be one of the best translations of novel to film of its period (and this puts it up against some stiff competition!). What really gives this version its edge is its outstanding cast.  First there is the always wonderful Ronald Coleman. Too few of his movies are available on DVD and it will be a happy day indeed when a large collection of his films are issued in a box set.  Along with Coleman, there are the always wonderful Madeline Caroll, C. Aubrey Smith, Raymond Massey, Mary Astor, and David Niven.
