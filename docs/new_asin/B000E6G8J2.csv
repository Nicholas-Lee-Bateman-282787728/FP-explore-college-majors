8106676,5,B000E6G8J2,"My favorite of Bishop Sheen's broadcasts. Amazing analysis of the Good Friday events. He breaks personalities (Pilot, Herod, Good Thief, Bad Thief, etc.) into categories and it was so interesting!  He is very focused and although in his other DVDs he makes jokes, in this one he makes one tiny joke but is focused on the topic, and is intent on the wonder. Less pomp, and more priest. I love his speaking, but in some DVDs, he kind of wanders, verbally. Not so in this one. A GREAT DVD.",1452384000,,486,4.46067415730337

Much aloha,
