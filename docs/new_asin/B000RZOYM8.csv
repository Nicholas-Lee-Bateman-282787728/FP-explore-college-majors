8203415,5,B000RZOYM8,"I've seen all of the National Parks, and Olympic is in the Top 10, a gorgeous place with three separate eco-systems. I'd set aside 3 days to see the park, but could've stayed longer. This DVD by Holiday Films is as complete as it needs to be, whether to tempt you to go, or to reminisce with after you've gone. I enjoyed it a lot, with great photography and clear narration. The extras are very good; I especially liked the Olympic Music Video segment, as well as the brief sojourns to nearby Mt St Helens, Mount Rainier and North Cascades. Also great info about the In-Park lodges.
This is definitely worth a watch, and I'm glad to have it in my Nat'l Park DVD collection.

To fans of the ""Twilight"" series: Forks, WA, is a real place and you have to go through it to cover all of the park's glory. A nice town, with lots of shopping opportunities.",1409961600,2,849,4.339622641509434

A disappointment!  There's some good photography, not quite first rate.  Narration is lifeless.  The entire film is not well put together.  Amaturish.
A good portion of the total time is of ""bonus video"" which could have been included in the main film.  There are too many separate videos, you must go through the titles and credits on each.
I purchased 2 from Wilderness Video at the same time--both were a disappointment.",1335052800,,446,4.95945945945946
