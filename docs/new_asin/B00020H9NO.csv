2052232,5,B00020H9NO,and 7 discs! WOW!  Compare this to the 2 discs you get in the sex in the city pack and what a deal you'll have here.  Caruso is as good here as he was on NYPD.,1084147200,7,159,3.388888888888889
2052233,3,B00020H9NO,"I have to say that I truly love this show.  I watch current episodes every Monday night.  Having said that, I actually stopped watching season one, 4 shows in, because Kim Delaney was such a poor fit to the rest of the ensemble cast that she dragged the whole show down.  I started watching again once she was gone and it seemed the stories were better and the cast worked 100% better without her.
I would buy this set, if I could get it minus the episodes she was in.
I will buy Season 2 once it's out.  I have to say also that I watched this show initally because I was a CSI:  Crime Scene Investigation Fan....looking at this latest season on TV, I think that CSI: Miami has actually gotten significantly better than it's spawning series - too bad too cause the original series was so good until recently......",1083456000,4,813,4.357615894039735
2052234,5,B00020H9NO,"CSI: Miami is a great ""detective"" show. The people behind this show tend to do a pretty good job of keeping things realistic and each episode typically features a plausable situation. While the show focuses more so on solving the cases and investigating the crime scene, they do tend to insert small pieces of sub-plot regarding each of the main characters, so the show is not without sufficient character development.
Typically, CSI: Miami is a good show to watch if you want to see the scientific side of things. Rather than most other police shows, which focus less on what goes on behind the scenes and more on the detective characters. However, while the main characters lack the focus of other shows, they are still enjoyable to watch. David Caruso does an excellent job with his performance as the logical and thorough Horatio Caine, while each of the other characters support him nicely.
I'd highly recommend this series to anyone who appreciates the scientific side of crime scene investigation. It's well worth your time.",1083110400,42,1031,4.931034482758621

So, I'm glade that the DVD set will be out soon. I look forward to catching the ones that I had to miss. It will be a great addiction to my CSI DVD Set.

2052237,4,B00020H9NO,"Great series, lots of entertainment value here, I recommend it. 2 bitches/ comments that kept if from 5 stars: Packaging is great at keeping disks in place until you get it, but only safe and frustration proof way of getting them OUT is to hold disk with slight upward finger pressure while you use needle-nose pliers to bend back the plastic retention tab on 1 side of ID. They snap back in OK, but  you have to have 2 disks at a time out to get them back in order, due to overlapping disk packaging. Otherwise it takes 5 minutes per disk without tools to coax them OUT without snapping a disk in half. After the 4th disk out of 65 total, I went for my toolbox and all was well after that. The other minor snivel is that it keeps asking you on almost every episode if you want to hear the commentary. This should only be asked once per disk (I did not want to hear it, and I did not watch the special features, just get on with the next episode). So the series is great, packaging needs tools to extract disks.",1516320000,4,1011,4.184615384615385

2052241,1,B00020H9NO,"I absolutely  LOVE CSI Miami! I watch the whole series every 4 months from the beginning. So, when it went in sale for black Friday, I rushed to order it. Everything was all good until I got to season 7 disk 4. It was not in the set. I had an extra final season disk 4. What in the hell am I going to do with 2 of the same damn disk! I called Amazon and they were extremely helpful. Sent me a whole new box set and told me to keep the original in case it was missing something later in the other seasons. I received the new box set and guess what, another freaking box set with 2 final season disk 4 and no season 7 disk 4. So, now I have 4 final season disk 4 and no season 7 disk 4! Now I'm really pissed. Call back again and was told, again,they can't send out just 1 disk. Can send a new box set, but can't guarantee I will get season 7 disk 4. So, I get the option for a credit to get just season 7 sent to me. I'm okay with this, but I was not okay with having to pay the tax for the order. Once again I have to wait a couple of days before I get my disk. Not a very happy customer at this time. I do appreciate Amazon for trying to correct the error, but the vendor or manufacturer is a waste and needs to be advised of the error they are making.",1514851200,6,1253,3.746212121212121
2052242,5,B00020H9NO,"Very interesting crime solving show and a great price. Somewhat different than the vegas version. More likable characters imo.
If you set your TV to 'closed captioned' the dvds should be automatic subtitled, too. This works even if the dvd itself does NOT provide that option.
Update on the packaging. It REALLY sucks. Very hard to remove individual dvds without fear of bending them. Took everything apart and stored all 65 dvds in my big Slappa case instead.",1512345600,,460,4.910256410256411
2052243,5,B00020H9NO,"This is a great complete series in 3 boxes (3-4 seasons in each) but this does require some care in taking a disk off the plastic multi-disk holder to play it etc.  The only negative (very small) is that the listing says ""Closed-captioned and Subtitles: English"" BUT this is NOT available until season NINE which can be an issue for someone like myself who needs it. I still am giving it 5 stars because the sound was excellently done and I only had a problem a few times.",1512172800,5,472,4.363636363636363
2052244,5,B00020H9NO,A perfect christmas gift. The box set is well packaged.,1512086400,,55,4.6
2052245,4,B00020H9NO,"Just like the complete CSI series being released in a single set so too is this one coming out. Like the original we follow the forensic unit of another police department, this time in Miami. We also find a group of agents working together to corral the bad guys, to gather evidence and to arrest said bad guys to put in jail. The same format was used but its own twist was added.

To start with was the look. MIAMI had a golden tint to the entire series, a yellow and orange palette that gave everything that sunny Florida look to it. The flavors of the area were apparent in each episode as well depicting Miami as a party town filled to overflowing with bikini clad babes and T-shirt wearing muscle bound bouncers at clubs. Every week a party was going on somewhere.

At the head of this team was someone completely unlike Gil Grissom of CSI. Lt. Horatio Caine (David Caruso) was the calm, cool head of the department, knowledgeable in the science needed but more inclined to take to the street in pursuit of a criminal. Each episode usually opened with the crime scene, the CSI team showing up and a double entendre dropped by Caine as he slowly put his shades on only to have the quiet disrupted by the scream of Roger Daltry and the Whos Wont Get Fooled Again blaring from the screen.

The catch phrases and sunglass slinging became so familiar that it wasn't long until they were pillaged. Memes began to break out online showing a 4 panel set up for some political commentary or joke that always featured the last two panels nearly alike, one with Caine and a catch phrase, the last with YEAHHHH over a shot of Miami. Certainly there was some humor to the scenes as the series went forward with it happening each year, but while the show was hot few made light of it.

The cast here felt like it had more personal problems presented than the original series though both featured storylines involving their characters. Calleigh Duquesne (Emily Proctor) had personal issues involving a romance with a fellow detective. Eric Delko (Adam Rodriquez) had a minor substance abuse issue and his sister Marisol ended up marrying Caine before she was shot down by criminals out to get Caine. Tim Speedle (Rory Cochrane) always seemed to have issues with the way things were handled. Rounding out the most long term cast member list was Alexx Woods (Khandi Alexander) the pathologist who always talked to the corpses calling them baby and looking for clues to help catch culprits.

The series ran for ten seasons and ran 232 episodes. There were episodes where they crossed over with the other CSI shows both in Vegas and New York. Those were always a treat because the first part would air on one show and the follow up on the other. In a world where were growing accustomed to a Marvel Universe this was the same sort of set up, a cross pollinating world of forensic police officers determined to aide one another in search of justice.

As with my review for the original series there was no way I could honestly sit down and watch every single episode before writing this review. So picking out a few here and there over the years, trying to get a glimpse at the different casts that changed as time went on I found that the series, like its predecessor, never grew stale. Each episode was top notch in the technical department and the acting never failed to keep the bar high. I imagine that after some time a person would tire of the same role but it didn't mean that the fans had lost interests. As with most series a shuffling of schedules to accommodate the next big thing will lead to a ratings decline and if memory serves me thats what happened here. Still, ten seasons is nothing to shake a stick at. As a matter of fact a BBC article noted that this series was the worlds most popular series ranking in the top ten in a number of countries in 2005.

One thing thats interesting to note is that the show this one was dropped so that there was room on the schedule for it lasted only one season. Yet another great example of the poor judgement of executives in higher offices. I wonder if they were the same ones that shuffled the series POLICE SQUAD to different nights over a 5 week period and then canceled it never realizing how popular it was until the NAKED GUN films came out and did huge box office.

Fans of the show will be delighted to pick this set up. Not only will you get the entire series in a nicely packaged edition but it will take up less shelf space as well. In addition to that are hours of extras that will please fans. Binge watching the series may take a few weeks but thats okay for those of us who enjoyed the show. Just don't wake up the neighbors as each show starts and you find yourself screaming out loud with Daltry as the show opens.",1511308800,,4775,4.449142857142857

2052263,5,B00020H9NO,"If I could use one word to describe CSI: Miami, it would be 'warm'. Both in color and character behavior, especially when compared to the original CSI. Immediately, I took a strong liking to Horatio and Calleigh when watching season one and over the next few episodes came to really get invested in each of them. To be honest, I'm not real sure why many people seem to prefer the original over Miami as I think they're both very similar shows, yet totally different. Where CSI is literal and very technical, Miami is more about the way Horatio bonds with the victims and saves the day, while overall being a great and supportive boss. Gil in comparison, doesn't seem to have any feelings except when it comes to bugs. He is cold and rude to his fellow CSI's, especially Greg and it's very uncomfortable to watch. My least favorite character in Miami is still more likeable than my favorite in CSI. I also feel that the chemistry between each of the characters on Miami is significantly stronger. Horatio is a friend and a good boss, never berating his CSI's for mistakes and praising them for a job well done. Some have criticized the show for precisely that, stating Horatio is ""too perfect"" but I think he's just a kind person.

This season is a very, very solid kickoff to the second in franchise of the CSI series. It is also my favorite reincarnation. Miami ""officially"" begins with a Las Vegas episode titled ""Cross Jurisdictions"" where we are introduced to each of the main characters and they are given ample screen time. It's also a great taste of what is to come for the whole series as throughout the show's 10 season run, the characters stay mostly to true form. CSI: Miami is known for being very colorful, and highly saturated and while compared to even the original and CSI: NY, this season is not as colorful as it will be in later seasons. And that is also another aspect that really drew me to Miami in the first place. I like high saturation, bright lights, and beautiful scenery. Miami delivers on all accounts. For the first season, we don't get the brightness we are usually accustomed to. This is very evident in their interrogation rooms where it is dark and cool, with blue being the main component. We do see plenty of the beautiful city of Miami though, each episode has some amazing shots.

While this is a great introduction to the series and you will love it if watching for the first time, when you compare it to CSI: Miami's nine other seasons, it's a little dull. The series definitely gets more exciting and character driven as it goes on. As being the show's official series premiere, ""Golden Parachute"" is very exciting and showcases what each and every character does the best. Eric being the resident diver, recovering underwater evidence, Calleigh examining bullet holes, Alexx caring for the dead and so on. There are a few duds (""Wet Foot/Dry Foot"", which also provides some political leanings I don't care for and ""Breathless"", just generally boring) but these occur early in the season so as it continues, it just gets better. The good definitely outweigh the bad here. ""Kill Zone"", ""Dispo Day"", ""Ashes to Ashes"", and particularly ""Broken"" are just a few of the season's best. ""Broken"" is uncharacteristically dark for Miami, which makes it overall one of the series best. And in the season finale ""Body Count"", a prison breakout has occurred which sparks an exciting few episodes manhunt.

As for the product itself, the season one dvd is in a plastic case that flaps open and goes into an outer cover insert. Special features and a list of every episode is included on the back of the outside case, clearly stating which disk they are on. The dvd's themselves have nice cover design and are in a very sturdy and protective holder. For being the first season, there are a decent number of special features, each of them being fun and informative with behind the scenes sneak peeks and cast interviews. Four audio commentaries are also available. If you are someone who likes fun dvd menus (as I do), then you will be a little disappointed in this one. It's just like CSI: Las Vegas first few seasons with a boring background. Just go straight to the episodes! The show is presented in widescreen format, and unfortunately does NOT have subtitles! The quality of video and audio is exactly how you would have viewed it on tv, not diminishing the overall product.

If you are a HUGE CSI: Las Vegas fan, you might be a little biased and not care for Miami. If you're like me and feel neutral, you might love Miami. It is definitely worth a shot and this is a great product.",1460937600,5,4614,4.643818849449205

2052288,4,B00020H9NO,"I just finished CSI MIAMI and am adding my thoughts here.  I have watched the entire CSI NY and Las Vegas and have the DVDs that are out
and have high  praise for them.  My feelings about this series is mixed; I don't think they have the same class of characters that NY or LV has,
though as the series went on the likeability of some of the characters improved with me.  I think  Boss David Caruso has in seven discs evolved
into a very good character.  I don't care much for the Russian/Cuban though perhaps I will have to give him time.  The blond (Bleached?) I did not
like until recently;  I will give her time.  The other fellow is good, the detectives are well played and set sets terrific as well as the story lines.
  I do miss, however, the
Grissom and Gibbs characters and am more inclined to the NCIS shows than the CSIs though all series have super stories, beautiful scenery
and good action.  I am a Chicago/NY guy and never really interested in LV or Florida but at least these shows give me good views of areas that
I have never seen before and am impressed with.  I do wish that Horatio would give up that crappy baby gas guzzling Hummer; ugly, wasteful
and Frankensteinish!!!  I have all 10 seasons on DVDS (from Amazon) and entire set of CSI NY as well as 14 seasons of CSI LV and are receiving the newest episodes on my Video Library.  Four Stars for a very promising series.  Enjoy; worth the prices easily.",1419984000,,1428,4.332075471698113

2052293,3,B00020H9NO,"I had only seen a handful of CSI: Miami episodes over the years, so I finally worked through the first series, and it wasn't bad. It feels like the show and the characters are working on establishment, judging from later episodes in the series I've seen, but the focus on story is strong with each episode. It does seem like there isn't a lot of character background development, though, other than some exposition of Caine's background. Kim Delaney's character really seemed extraneous in the series, and her departure was just abrupt and shallow - I'm not sure if there was some kind of contract negotiations or something, but she just up and leaves the series midway without a final appearance. The rest of the characters are enjoyable, though, with the exception of the Rory Cochrane 'Speed' character, who I had a hard time getting behind, as he just has this ongoing cynical, frustrated attitude (sure, there are real people like this, I know, and working long hours in a CSI lab could make someone cynical, but all the same, it really comes across a little too strong in this character.)

The episodes are a mixed bag for me. Some are really impressive, such as ""Kill Zone"" and ""Body Count"", while some of the others leave more to be desired. There's plenty of gore and mature content, as to be expected from a crime drama, but also some intelligent twists in the writing. I suppose I was secretly hoping for a few more Miami Vice references but there really aren't many here, although David Caruso's expertly-played Caine character does seem like a reincarnation of the Martin Castillo character in some ways.",1418256000,,1617,4.775

But all in all this was a great purchase for me since I rarely watch TV anymore.  I'm loving the absence of commercials. I started out listening to the commentary on the stories, but I prefer to just be involved with the series as if it were real and not a play by play by the writers or developers.  The original cast of this series was fine tuned over time but the winning characters to me were of course the incomparable Horatio, Alex, Speed, Calleigh, Eric, Ryan, Natalie, Maxine, Frank Tripp.  This quirky lineup was stellar and fun to watch and made the show so very interesting.  At the end the character of Walter and Dr. Loman were a stretch and hard to imagine what they were thinking in casting them.  Not believable and like oil and water to the rest of the cast.  I lived in Ft. Lauderdale for awhile and it is fun to see Miami in the photos.  There is a lot of crime down there and every con man, shyster gravitates to this part of the country for some reason.  My only complaint with the series is that no matter what the crime, it was always the all American, well groomed, well to do suspect.  It was always the white guy or woman doing wrong.  It showed me how PC they were in avoiding casting anyone else as a criminal.  Irritating, just because it left out a portion of reality to the show because criminals do come in all colors not just white.  How we do get weary of television when it becomes political and message-y.  In the end that seemed more prevalent.  Such a loss, a great show!  Great to have on DVD so you can watch when you want.  As far as the order, I was pleased with the packaging and it arrived on time as well.",1416182400,,1933,4.23224043715847

2052354,5,B00020H9NO,"One thing that I felt the CSI franchise succeeded in doing at least in the early years was not being a cardboard cutout of the other incarnations of CSI. For example, Miami felt different than Vegas (even though the pilot episode was actually on CSI: Las Vegas) The Miami setting allowed the series to pursue some unique storylines such as immigration from Cuba and drug smuggling as in Wet Foot, Dry Foot that wouldn't have had the same punch in other locales. I remember when the show premiered, it was at the height of the CSI craze when there was a very real fear that we were going to end up with CSI: Juno Alaska.

The characters appear drawn to fit the setting rather than using tired cardboard cutouts like tough talking cop though David Caruso's Horatio Cain fit's the bill. Moving to the actual DVD's...there are seven discs in some very involved packaging fashioned to look like an case file, which I think is a fitting touch given the content of the series. Of course packaging costs and DVD extras probably drive the price of the DVD'S, but the extras really make the audience feel like there a deeper part of the show instead of just plopping a bunch of episodes on discs.",1324512000,6,1186,4.542056074766355
2052355,3,B00020H9NO,"I have now watched the original CSI all the way up to the completion of season 8 where they basically killed the show by killing off two main characters. In season nine I know they kill off the the Grissom character, so that is the exodus of three main actors of the CSI series. I'm sure there will still be some appeal of the continuation of the series but I have not as of yet viewed any of the new CSI lineup.

So, that being said I picked up a copy of Season 1 of CSI Miami. Now I live in North Florida.  Florida has been my home for all of my life. I would love to love this show, but I don't. It's certainly not awful, but it is also not that great. I think three stars is rather generous all things considered. The biggest problem with this show is probably the David Caruso character of Horatio. Horatio is just too damned cool. He never misspeaks. He is always right. He is extremely intelligent and extremely confident. In fact, the Horatio character must be the James Bond of all of the CSI characters. It's actually just ridiculous. Nobody would act like this guy in real life. Nobody is quite like Horatio in real life. In real life people misspeak, they make mistakes, they make fale hypothesis's. And then their is Horatio and his damned sunglasses. He is forever putting them on and taking them off. He's like the hammer of God or something. In fact, David Caruso's character if very smug. I'm not impressed at all with Caruso or the character of Horatio. Then there is Emiuly Proctor. I must say they fix her up to be great eye candy, even if she isn't overly hot. They slip her into those tight white pants and I must say I am perpetually gawking at her ass, which is accentuated by my widescreen television. As for her character, I like her voice. She is quite smart and professional. What is silly though is how the show tries to show her as perhaps being held back by her looks. She's just too damned hot to be taken seriously, or that is what the show has tried to explain. Her dad just thinks of her as his beautiful daughter overlooking her professional female status as a CSI gal. And then there is 53 year old Khandi Alexander. She's another piece of eye candy, and even at 53. Again, she is slipped into tight pants, tight shirts, bosom hugging blouses, etc. The producers are certainly turning us guys on. I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. But I can tell you that I am drooling over these two women. There was also the gal that didn't get the promotion because she had to take some time off when her husband died. Again, they pack all this gal has into very tight clothes showing us guys some nice T and A. And this one CSI gal isn't even that hot, but oh yeah, how tight the clothes are. Those tight clothes are nice for showing off the body but they are also distracting from whatever sort of plot the show might have. Then there is Horatio's ex sister in law. Horatio's police brother was killed. She too is made into a hottie, when she is really not so super hot. And on this show we have the ""token"" Cuban character. He's ok, but his addition was just so stereotypical to this show's cast. We have women, blacks, a Cuban American. Did I fail to mention this is South Florida? Ok, and all of these people are fairly pretty or handsome. Anyway, David Caruso's character is ridiculous. The guy is just never wrong and he is just too super cool. The show would be better if the sexiness was toned down. Oh dare I say that when I love to watch the T and A. The reduction of some of the eye candy would make the show seem a little less like Bay Watch, and Caruso wouldn't seem as much like David Hasselhoff.

This show needs to pay more attention to real human behavior than to hot looking actors who are too cool for the show's believeability.",1312070400,,3790,4.283124128312413

2052359,2,B00020H9NO,I love CSI: Miami but this season is a little much.  For one thing every time a murder happens it has to go into detail and look at all the gory parts that other seasons don't this season is also kind of boring in script I think Horatio has about the only good lines.

2052360,2,B00020H9NO,"OK, as a big fan of CSI Las Vegas I was disappointed with CSI Miami.  It wasn't just the quirky plots (later seen in CSI NY) that I liked in CSI LV but also the character interactions. First of all, some science folks.

1.  When you get a digital image, each pixel is encoded as just that, one pixel.  No matter how much you ""zoom"" you will not get any more detail from that pixel, let alone the image of a murderer from the one pixel like when they zoom in to the cornea of a person from crappy CCTV footage.

2.  Oxidation of phenolphthalin to phenolphthalein as a presumptive blood test is a two step process.  First you add phenolphthalin and wait for any colour change (false positive) then you add hydrogen peroxide.  None of this one drop and whoa, it's pink, we have blood.

3.  Infra-red camera's cannot see through a wall let alone a boat.  Think about it.  If infra-red rays could travel through walls then why bother insulating house walls?

Well, I could go on and on but I wont.  OK, I know all the CSI's use similarly bad science but it just stood out more in Miami.

I enjoyed the scenery in Miami but the music intervals were way too loud.  Time and time again I found myself having to turn the volume down for the music and turn it back up for the dialogue.  Bad editing there.

Too many non-continuities.  Take for example Marisol.  Eric says to Horatio how he's been paying her rent and expenses because she's sick and on chemo and couldn't work.  Only one or two episodes later Marisol says to Horatio that she has to get back to work.  Then later she's pampering herself at a women only retreat.  Was it at Eric's or Horatio's expense?

Oh, and why is it that the CSI guys always get to an emergency before the cops (leaving them to enter the premises toting their guns).  Are there no police cars on random patrol in Miami?  And when the swat team enters a building, why are our CSI chums right behind (or next to them) without proper bullet proof clothing and equipment?

I guess the quirkiness of CSI LV and NY meant that you didn't take it too seriously and thus overlooked the flaws while enjoying it.  CSI Miami tries to be serious with flawed science, re-worked themes, poor continuity and over-stylised characters.  Shame, it coulda been a contender.",1261440000,,2280,4.426506024096385

2052389,5,B00020H9NO,"Living in Las Vegas, the last thing I wanted to see was a show about this city on television. Having lived here most of my life, I didn't see anything interesting about it.

So, when CSI: Crime Scene Investigation came along, I decided to give it a try and see what it had to offer. Maybe it would be interesting, after all I enjoyed Profiler until it was cancelled; and this was similiar, yet only to a point.

30 minutes into CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, I fell asleep. And, each time I would watch the episodes, I'd nod off. After a few times, I gave it up. (Nothing personal to the cast, but they were not that interesting).

But to each their own. If one likes it and another doesn't; it doesn't make it a wrong choice, just personal choices and certainly you shouldn't be comparing the way something is done in one city to what is done in another. We are all looking for something different when we watch TV, and that fuels the choices we make.

In 2002, another CSI was coming out, this time with David Caruso as the lead actor and set in Miami. I was thinking Miami Vice with David Caruso; not a pretty sight, but worth a try.

Tried it I did, and got hooked (so hooked I own season 1-4 on DVD) and watch it whenever time permits.

Here I am, now 5 years later, looking forward to getting season 5 on DVD (I have to wait until Christmas cause someone in my family decided it'd be funny to give it to me as a gift).

I find the characters compelling and more approachable, the kind of people you'd call for help.

Yes (biting my own tongue), that even includes Caruso's ""Horatio Caine""; one of the best characters on the series. Tough when he has to be, compassionate where it warrants, never once forgetting about the families that are left behind. That to me is his only concern, and that is where it should be. It's that commitment I am attracted to.

Yes, he threatens dirtbags (oh my favorite parts of the episodes), but think about this, you would want Caine on your side to find your loved one's killer and would want him to do everything he could to ensure justice was done. No, you wouldn't like it if you were guilty of a crime, who would?

He's good with women and children, having perhaps too much of a protective instinct, which is lacking in today's society. Maybe that's why some people dislike his character. (Note: Caine's father killed his mother when he was younger, so there might be a reason for his attitude).

His tricks or nuances are his way of letting those around him know that he is always thinking, thinking about ways to get one step ahead of the killer and bring him/her to justice. Not to mention those little ""nuances"" make the suspect nervous, if you're guilty he will make you squirm.

The science is at times gruesome, then again, murder isn't pretty. We seem to forget that.

Alexx talking to the victims reminds us that these were once people too, that they had families, they were not just something that was discarded as trash.

We forget too often after people are dead that they were here and touched someone's life. We forget that they were someone's mother, father, daughter, son, brother, sister. They started out their day planning in some cases to come home to all of us, but fate intervened.

Alexx reminds us of this, and I personally like it. We need to be reminded of the consequences of greed, corruption and personal desires.

As far as Calleigh, Eric, Speed (who I miss in the series) and the rest of the CSI: Miami team, they are a diverse group that reminds us how workplace politics play a crucial role in how outcomes are determined; they have dedicated their lives to putting criminals behind bars and finding closure for the families.

Some of the stories are interesting, some make you think, and others are about par for the course when it comes to reality.

If you like it, you like it, there is no explaining it; you either have it on DVD or are planning to get it.

If you don't like it, no one is making you watch it or buy it, so leave it alone (clothing is clothing, I can dress like a model by buying certain clothes at Walmart). Don't waste your money, you're better off getting something you do like.

If you don't like the acting, don't watch it. This is after all--FICTION. The telling of a story that's purpose is to entertain.

And, I plan to keep watching as long as it's on.",1197504000,7,4361,4.419475655430712

CSI was a question to start with because I really didn't like David Caruso from NYPD Blue, but I love him in this show.  I love the cast and I really like the story lines.  I can't get my self wrapped around the other CSI shows, but I do like this one.  I also like all of the Law and Order shows.  So you see where my loyalties are.  The Closer, Saving Grace all on A&E, so it is no wonder that CSI Miami caught my eye.  Now I am an UNBOX fan watching my shows when I can on my Creative Vision: M 30 G........love that too!

And yes, the first season is just as bad as I feared. It's awful. David Caruso is horrific, overacting for all he's worth; the blond southern chickie and the black doctor chickie are equally shudder-worthy in places, although they have a heck of a lot more moments of grace than ""Horatio"" does. I sincerely hope this gets much better as it goes on because right now I'm sort of stupefied. And yet, still better than some of the other stuff I end up watching, so I must just be a bad TV junkie... Maybe it just grows on you, like a fungus?

2052436,5,B00020H9NO,"I was quite the skeptic about this series from the moment I saw ""Cross Jurisdictions."" As an avid CSI fan, I was outraged that Anthony Zuiker and Jerry Bruckheimer were looking to turn their winning formula into a franchise, and spin it off in Law & Order fashion. I believed that sure, it worked for Law & Order, because each series was different than the original. Each dealt with different areas of investigation and prosecution. But to use the same crime-scene investigating formula over and over, just changing the cities around, did not appeal to me whatsoever.

That was four years ago. Now, as CSI: Miami moves into its fourth season, I have become a fan. Where I once was annoyed by Horatio Caine (his penchant for removing and replacing his sunglasses as well as his constant hands-on-hips stance), I began to like his character; the gentle way in which he treated the victims, his passion for solving cases and putting the bad guys away.... not to mention his obvious chemistry with MDPD's resident ""Bullet Girl"" -- the lovely Southern belle, Calleigh Duquesne.

The Horatio/Calleigh chemistry was what spurred me to purchase season one, and I am so far very pleased with the purchase. Other Horatio/Calleigh fans should consider buying season one, as all the great ""H/C"" episodes are contained therein: ""Kill Zone"", ""Camp Fear"", etc.

I still don't like the way Alexx Woods speaks to the cadavers in her autopsy theater. As a future pathologist, it just makes me roll my eyes. Otherwise, this was a worthwhile purchase.

Now the cases are pretty good, and some of them are even close to as moving as the ones in CSI Las Vegas.  Calleigh Duquesne is pretty attractive but somewhat anoying in voice.

2052441,1,B00020H9NO,"CSI: Miami is a pale imitation of the original and superior show. First off the characters have barely any of the appeal or charisma or depth of character that the original CSI investigators have. Second, while the original has a creepy gothic tone CSI:Miami tries to be glamorous like Miami Vice but this this isn't the problem is that where the original contains elements of suspense and mystery that are esential to a good who done it, Miami goes for an over the top action adventure tone and contains none of the sly dark humor of the original. Instead of the team solving a simple murder we've seen Miami use ""big action sequences"" that use really bad CGI. Often their cases involve larger that life circumstances or large disasters. We've seen a bridge fall apart with cars on it, a tidal wave wipe out a whole block and David Caruso drive his Humvee through an exploding building and each one of these scenes were laugh out loud funny instead of exciting.

Thirdly, and most importantly,  the main problem is David Caruso. While he was OK on NYPD Blue and good in King of New York and Session 9, on CSI:Miami he consistently gives THE WORST acting performance on network television. The character is played all wrong. The Humvee that he drives is too over the top and unlike William Peterson, who plays the character of Grissom with intelegence and grace, Caruso plays it as the same tough guy that he did in NYPD Blue. Grissom is a scientist first and foremost who is slightly nerdy but useses intellegence and inductiveness to outwit his opponent and solve his cases. Caine comes off nothing like a scientist. He acts as a tough guy who bullies and threatens all of his suspects. He threatens at least one character per episode that either he'll get them or they'll be sorry if they don't give him the information he is seeking. First off, threatening a wittnes or suspect like he does and he'd be suspended in a second for being unprofessional. Secondly, every episode Caine is 100% correct as to the perpetrator is early in the episode. He never makes a mistake or never does the evidence take him to another suspect. Also, it's hillarious how every suspect breaks down and admits the truth and tell how they went about whatever crime that they are accussed of the second Caine confronts them. Never do the suspects deny anything(real life) or ask for a lawyer.

This show is so bad me and my roomates made it into a drinking game. Everytime David Caruso takes off or puts on his sunglasses take a drink. Everytime he threatens someone take two drinks. Gurantee you'll be having a good time at the end of the hour.",1117670400,8,2625,4.616702355460386

2052458,5,B00020H9NO,"There have been constant complaints about CSI: Miami because it is too similar to CSI.  People have to realize that this show is not totally disconnected from CSI, but rather it is a spin-off by the same producer, writers, etc...  The jobs are similar in crime scene investigations.  The characters seem similar at first, but they are worlds apart.

 Gil Grissom dislikes getting attached to cases in any way, but Horatio Caine is either your best friend (to the victims) or your worst enemy (to the suspects and the criminals).

 Calleigh Duquesne is comparable to Catherine Willows.  Both have family problems, both are often having trouble with men.  (Calliegh- they are all over her, Catherine- just can't find a good one)

 Eric and Nick are both the ""ladies man"" of their groups.  They also have problems with evidence, Eric sneezes on it once, and Nick pulls the coating off an ""ancient"" sword once when he is finger printing it.  Yet, we still see differences.  Eric's family is very important to him, while we never hear things about Nick's family.

 Kim Delaney's character, Meghan, and Sara Sidle can be deemed similar in only one aspect- they both have problems.  Sara was abused and abused alcohol.  Meghan's husband died and she cannot get over it.

 The coroners are different as well.  Doc Robbins is nonchalant and even drinks coffee when he is telling Grissom about the victim.  Alexx Woods feels pain for the victims and talks to them as if they were talking back.

 The characters are a little more dramatic on a regular basis, but less dramatic at big crime scenes.  Eric becomes angry when the police do more for a missing blue-eyed, blonde-haired girl than they do for a missing Cuban girl, yet he doesn't reach the extremes and start shouting at the suspect as Sara did once.  When the four murders occurred in CSI, everyone worked almost non-stop, some went without sleep.  In the multiple on CSI: Miami, everyone stays pretty calm and collected on the outside, even when it came to the baby.

 This show was made to hold up CSI.  They did not want it to overcome CSI, but rather have it support viewers, giving them more options and enticing them to buy more products.  The investigators are cops as well, making the show similar to a cop show, yet, CSI: Miami maintains the air of CSI.",1104969600,23,2312,4.705

2052465,1,B00020H9NO,"Unlike the original CSI, the characters in this muddled melodrama have no precise functions--we don't know anything about anyone except Calleigh and her expertise with firearms. There is no clear process, no clear hierarchy, none of the wonderful detail we get in the Las Vegas CSI, where the lead, William Peterson as Grissom, hands out assignments even, so we know exactly what everyone's doing and why. In CSI: Miami we mostly see Caruso taking up nearly all the screen-time (if he's not actually in every scene, he's very nearly), he doesn't seem to be a scientist so I have no idea why he's in the Forensics Dept., he is always larger-than-life heroic, with his manly hands on his hips, putting on or pulling off his groovy sunglasses, saving the day by first overidentifying with victims (a problem that shouldn't affect CSI's, and which we see in Las Vegas, Sara Sidle's character always wrestling with and getting chastised for, which is realistic and appropriate) and then neatly solving the entire case himself with the occasional input of one of the other members of his so-called team. He is deeply obnoxious, and the main reason I do not watch the show any longer (I really tried, because I adore Emily Proctor). The other reason I don't watch is that I cannot tell who is what--storylines are chaotic, the CSI's are always drawing their guns (a rarity in real life and on the original), and everything's always about Horatio (Caruso) and his need to keep promises no CSI nor detective would ever make, especially to children. Its absurd plots are over-the-top, and it's disappointing because I had high hopes after the very good cross-over episode of CSI which introduced the Miami gang. On that episode people's jobs were clearer, and they all had senses of humor (there is NO humor in the show as it exists on its own). Also, in the first season, Kim Delaney was grating and dreadful (grapevine was that Caruso didn't like her taking up his screen-time and had her feeling much abused, which seems to have leaked into her performance). I don't blame her--I couldn't stand him for a second, though he used to be good and was fun in ""Proof of Life.""

The one really pleasant note is that Emily Proctor is an absolute delight, however little she's been given to do. Her look has changed to a sun-drenched Floridian, and she looks startlingly different from her ""West Wing"" days and first season on Miami. She was always a beauty, but now seems a natural one, not an executive one as on WW. The rest of the group is good, too, though I'm not sure what they do, their CSI levels, their scientific backgrounds. The only other one who gets on my nerves is the ""talking to the corpse"" coroner, Alex, whose ""empathy"" just seems transparently put-on. And because they're not doing science, the show's ""reproductions"" of events are usually pretty lame. On CSI, we see the trajectory of a bullet, and how it damages the inside of the body. In Miami, we see a couple dancing in flashback, as though we couldn't have imagined that ourselves.

Sadly, the NY show doesn't look to be much better, and it's no surprise that Peterson, who co-created CSI, is always reminding people that he has nothing to do with the spin-off's. I'd be reminding everyone, too. Truthfully, even on the original, the CSI's have more contact with witnesses and the criminals than do real-life CSI's who are evidence collectors and lab-rats. In Las Vegas, they keep the CSI contact with witnesses and suspects to a minimum and do pump up the drama a bit this way, but they spend a trememdous amount of time on the real science, and manage not to make it boring. And the actors on the original seem fine with screen-time being taken up with them doing procedural things--none seem to be hankering for lots of inaccurate dramatic scenes with the people the detectives usually talk to once they get the CSI reports. And they always have a detective in charge, whereas on Miami, Horatio (Caruso) is in charge of absolutely everything!!! It's a one-man show with human props.

My recommendation is to buy the original series, and just watch re-runs of this series on Spike, or whatever network has secured the rights for syndication. It's not worth $75.",1095465600,11,4225,4.753405994550409
2052466,2,B00020H9NO,"I really liked the original series and when I finished its first 3 seasons, I was looking for more and decided to try this. A big let-down.  The regular characters never get very involving, if one of them got killed in the line of duty who would care?  Also, where the original series had some humor and wit, especially as to how the crimes were committed or twists of fate that obscured how they happened, this has very little humor, and wit has been replaced with gross-out or shock appeal.  Now its how many family members can all be killed in one episode, what's the youngest victim they can come up with, how gruesomely presented can be murders be, how much torture or mutilation can be shown to spice things up?  This is like the National Enquirer version of CSI.  Perhaps it is a natural evolution as the writers have to find 2 more new crimes to present each week.  They've run out of clever, so they go for shock.",1094774400,3,922,4.394117647058824

I really missed him when he left NYPD blues, and I stopped watching it.  He is doing a outstanding job in this show as well.  The other charaters on the show are doing an outstanding job.  I like this as well as the other CSI.  Different people, different place and a lot of stories to tell. They all work great together.  I will be looking for the next season when it comes out.  The one thing that was about to loose me was the song for the show, but I got passed it.  I like the song for CSI in Los Vegas and I had gotten use to it, but the more that I watched CSI in Miami I didn't mind it so much.  I hope that the charaters remain the same and don't change.",1094688000,5,777,3.923076923076923
2052468,4,B00020H9NO,"I generally like the show and sometimes preferred it to the original CSI, but I have to agree to another reviewer's opinion. While I like David Carusio's character, he is becoming boring and predictable to me. While he often talks tough to suspects, the ""suspect"" usually turns out to be innocent! And Emily Procter, while no doubt a beautiful lady, is in my opinion the worst actress I've seen. Why is she always so cheerful? She smiles while there's nothing to smile about. Why can't she get that grin out of her face? Is she on drugs? I remember there's one episode in which she's affected by cocaine and was high, but I couldn't tell the difference because that's the way she's always been!",1094428800,3,694,4.604838709677419
2052469,5,B00020H9NO,"The original series never clicked with me. But this grabbed hold from the first episode that I saw. Its great to see David Caruso back on TV in a role that fits him perfectly. His sudden departure from NYPD Blue was a disappointment back in 1994. Character development of the cast comes along nicely and every episode reveals something new.

The quality of these DVDs is excellent - wonderful sharp images and crystal clear sound. I believe Season 2 will be forthcoming in January 2005.

Much as I like the show, my only gripe will be the price of this collection. It was $67 when it was released and now I notice that it has gone north of $70. I hope its not somehow linked to price of oil. Mid-40s would be better, CBS.",1094083200,8,721,4.373134328358209

2052472,3,B00020H9NO,"Fans may argue, but ""CSI: Miami"" remains superior to its Las Vegas counterpart. Surrounded by a fine cast, David Caruso's strong presence makes the difference - it's great to have him back on TV where he belongs. The exotic locations, topical storylines and offbeat characterizations prove that the series is here for the long run. ""CSI: Miami"" does not represent groundbreaking television, yet it delivers the crime-drama goods.",1090368000,9,429,5.323529411764706

More than this : no subtitles, even in english.

So disappointing !",1089676800,4,284,4.089285714285714

2052476,5,B00020H9NO,"Being a CSI las Vegas fan, I wasn't happy when they made CSI Miami. I picked this up due to the summer break of CSI, I needed something.. and this was my choice! I can honestly say that it was a worthwhile purchase after having watched all of the episodes. True David Caruso is no Gil Grissom, but would you want him to be? The feel of the series is very different with the set being in Miami. The cast is on par with the Las vegas cast. Las Vegas has a more personal feel to it, as many times the originals bring their personal lives into the story (i.e. Catherine being a stripper, Warrick being a Gambler), and you don't find that as much in Miami. The focus seems to stay more to the storyline.
Kim Delaney was a welcome cast-off in my opinion. She dragged the series down with her poor attitude, and had no chemistry with David Caruso. She came across as an uptight investigator who had no interest in getting along with her fellow CSIs, or have any passion in getting the truth. I was very glad when she finally left.
Another difference between Las Vegas and Miami that is striking is how each CSI is an expert in their certain field. Callegh is the ""Bullet Girl"", Speedle is the AV expert, Delco is the Diving tech who speaks russian, and spanish, acts as the go between the Cuban community and the MDPD. Alexx talks to her patients as they were still alive, and in general is friendlier then Al Robbins of Las Vegas.
In conclusion, try it, the two CSIs are comparable, like the many Law and Order spinoffs, you can choose your favorite, but in my opinion each one is strong, and holds its own. You can enjoy either, but take a vacation from Las Vegas to Miami.",1088553600,72,1668,4.3152866242038215
2052477,5,B00020H9NO,"I love CSI Miami, David Caruso who plays Horatio Caine, does a wonderful acting job. He makes you believe in the CSI and that they are there to help and solve cases. He has a certain charisma that he portrays and that makes him very believable. This being a spin off CSI, i feel that this show does things better. It's location and the types of crime scenes that they have, are so much more better and make it more enjoyable to watch. If you haven't seen any episodes before think about buying the DVD, cuz u'll probably end up loving the show. I don't really like other shows like Law and Order and CSI for much, but the cast and type of crimes in this series make me love it alot.",1088553600,8,682,4.174242424242424

2052479,1,B00020H9NO,"Aside from Cochrane who gets an occasional good scene in, this show is nothing like the original. Instead of justice seekers, most of the main characters in the episodes come off as morality cops indirectly implying that each victim's lifestyle led to his/her demise. Also, the ideas of 'due process' and 'Miranda rights' appear to not be relevant when questioning suspects.",1088553600,7,374,5.147540983606557

""So our good Samritan...(takes off glasses)...is now...a murderer.""
And it's the same every week. William Petersen has so much more charisma and I expect we'll find that Gary Sinese will out-act Caruso as well.
I wouldn't buy this DVD set if you paid me to do it.",1088467200,7,391,4.52112676056338
2052481,5,B00020H9NO,"I have preferred this show to CSI from the start...it appeals to me more. I find the characters more likable and more compassionate. I also feel there is great chemistry with all of them. With one exception...and this applies to season one only...I never felt Kim Delaney's character fit in and was glad when she left. I never really understood why she was added...it was obvious, to me, that when the CSI:Miami cast was introduced in ""Crossing Jurisdictions"" they all fit perfectly the way they were. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". I also prefer the Miami location...it's mostly bright and sunny...which is more appealing to me.
I'm really glad to see this finally coming out on DVD...and I hope season two will not take as long to be put on DVD.
A side note: I have no ill feelings towards Kim Delaney...I think she is good actress and have watched her since her soap days...this show was just not for her.",1087776000,13,912,4.601226993865031
2052482,3,B00020H9NO,"""CSI: Miami"" is a good show with a lot of problems that could and should be easily solved.
First of all, the characters are never really as defined as the ones on ""CSI.""
Secondly, the show occasionally veers away from the mystery/whodunnit format of ""CSI"" and becomes a cop show with a dab of science thrown in.
Another standard, un-""CSI""-like plot line has Horatio Caine disliking a suspect and spending the rest of the show finding evidence to convict him/her. When there's a twist and a 2nd suspect emerges that Caine doesn't like, I find myself not liking Caine.
A third problem is David Caruso and his character. Horatio Caine is someone trying to be cool but isn't. His brooding is excessive, and his constant staring off into space is predictable.
Then there's David Caruso's inability to find a place for his hands. He's constantly putting them on his hips or putting on/taking off his sunglasses. After about 5 episodes, this gets alternately annoying and hilarious.
Another aspect of Horatio Caine is his repetitious dialogue. There are shows where his lines are exactly the same as in last week's show. For example, he's constantly saying, ""OK, this is what we're going to do.""
As for the episodes on these disks, there are additional problems.
Beautiful Emily Procter is a little too made up.
The shows on these disks include the episodes with Kim Delaney, who didn't fit in and was totally unconvincing as a crime scene investigator. The show improved immensely when she left.
I don't mind these problems when ""CSI: Miami"" can present you with a good plot twist, poignant story, or last-minute piece of esoteric evidence. But when it fails to deliver, which, during the 1st season, was about every 3rd or 4th episode, the problems become obvious, and the show becomes uninteresting and campy.",1087171200,17,1805,4.8827361563517915
