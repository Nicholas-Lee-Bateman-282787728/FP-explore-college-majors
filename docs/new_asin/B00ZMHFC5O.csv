8720523,5,B00ZMHFC5O,"Disclaimer: I bought the MP3 version on Google Play, not the DVD, so I'm commenting on audio and music quality.

That said, I love this record. The performances are out of this world. Moon and Young lay down a very deep groove, while Larson really fills the space with spacey solos that create great atmospheres. I like the music a lot, it is instrumental fusion, but the guitar doesn't wander off as much as other typical fusion records - Larson focuses more on the theme/melody/song than in guitar hero gymnastics.

Great audio quality. Every instrument is detailed and crisp, good bottom end (the bass sounds super sweet). Wish some studio records I own sounded as good as this live record does.

If you get the chance to see them live, do so. It's a great, super tight show.",1439510400,,778,4.6231884057971016
