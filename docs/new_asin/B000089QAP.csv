1831857,4,B000089QAP,"while I did enjoy this workout-a lot of focus was put on executing the exercises and proper positioning on the ball which is key for everyone novice or experienced-I found just doing a single segment at a time was ineffective but the geat aspect about dvd is that you can do all three in a row-very effective or do 2 of one type, 3 of another ect. Overall a good purchase, I have over 50 exercise dvds and movies-not sorry I bought this one!",1049068800,135,441,4.261904761904762

1831859,2,B000089QAP,The workout includes excercised with weights. I was looking just for stability ball exercises. The description of the CD doesnt mention the need of extra equipment...and there is quite a bit of time offered to the exercises with the weights. The selection of the exercices with the ball is very generic...nothing special at all... unfortunetly the CDs i would have liked are only available for US costumers. It would have been a 1 start but this is one of the very few CDs that work for All zones as my device is bought in Europe.,1469836800,3,530,4.589473684210526

1831863,5,B000089QAP,"OMG I have purchased this video twice, because I mistakenly thought I lost the original. Anyway this video is one of the easiest ones to use especially if you are a novice with the ball. The 10 minute increments are sufficient in providing an effective workout.

1831869,1,B000089QAP,"This dvd is not for beginners.  The instructor moves way too fast.  I spent more time trying to keep myself balanced than I did doing the moves b/c she zips from one move to the next with barely a pause between.  If you're new to working with a stability ball, it's hard to focus on both keeping yourself stable and doing the moves properly.  I feel like these moves were too advance and probably better suited for someone who is familiar with using a stability ball.",1427846400,,467,4.395348837209302

1831871,5,B000089QAP,You are getting a great workout and don't feel it until the next day. It does need a warm up and cool down segment but over all it is a good workout. Yes it is boring but what work out videos aren't?  Why do they not put some classic rock music in them and make them more enjoyable?,1426291200,,282,3.8620689655172415

1831873,5,B000089QAP,"This workout is great. I had a vcr rendition of it for years before my vcr ate it. It's only 30 minutes, targets every part of your body, and you can make it as tough as you want depending on the weights you chose.",1422835200,,214,3.8863636363636362
1831874,5,B000089QAP,"It is only about 30 minutes but VERY effective.  I first thought, ""how challenging can this be in 30 minutes""?  It is quite a workout.  I exercise regularly and I was sweating by the end of this.  It does challenge your stability and I have come to really enjoy workouts that incorporate a stability ball.  What's really great about this is that it is short and very effective which works best when you're pressed for time.  I am going to add this to my weekly routine at least 3-4 times in addition to my other DVD workouts.",1421107200,4,525,4.360824742268041

1831877,5,B000089QAP,"I have been using this program for years and I love it.  I have purchased several copies over the years to give as presents to friends.  The three 10-minute sessions, each focusing on a different area of the body, give a thorough workout in only 30 minutes.  One nice feature is that there is a counter at the bottom of the screen, so you can always see how many more minutes are left in that session.  There is a background music beat, but no melody.  The beat makes you feel energized, while the lack of specific melody means you won't grow tired of hearing the same songs repeatedly.  I like the approach and choice of exercises.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1410998400,8,662,4.421487603305785

1831881,4,B000089QAP,"This is a great DVD if you are just starting out with a Stability ball or are like me and have some jiggle in the middle. If you are starting out looking for some focus on your core, this is a good one.  All three workouts, force you to think about your core and keeping it tucked in helping you balance on the ball.

1831888,5,B000089QAP,"I love this workout...Keli Roberts is very clear in her instruction regarding form and technique and the video doesn't bounce all over the room when the move changes (the way it does with some workout dvds!). It's a challenging workout, but definitely doable! It feels like a quick workout. The 10 minute breakdown makes it achievable and there's a sense of satisfaction when you're done; you can tell it's going to make a difference if you're consistent with it.",1359072000,,463,4.8734177215189876
1831889,5,B000089QAP,"I was looking for an inexpensive DVD stability ball workout on-line and this one was the best priced.  It was used, but has run well.

1831890,3,B000089QAP,"Im sure this work out is fine for more experienced ball users but just trying to balance on the ball takes up most of my time; so Im not really getting the work out.

1831891,4,B000089QAP,I really like that the video is divided into 3 10 minute sections so if you are running short with time you can just pick the area you most need to focus on.,1302998400,3,157,3.787878787878788
1831892,5,B000089QAP,"This is a great workout DVD if, like me, you're very out of shape, and especially if you have back problems. There are several things that I also particularly like about this DVD:

1.) the countdown clock. It helps keep me motivated if I can tell myself I only have X minutes left to go. I honestly wish all workout DVD's had this feature because it really does make a difference.
2.) 3 separate exercises from which you can do 1, 2, or all 3. Each section does get your heart rate up, but really works the areas that section is targeted on.
3.) the instruction is concise, not cheerleader-y, and there are modifications for those who need them.
4.) the pace of the exercises is not slow, but it's not so fast that you struggling to keep up either.
5.) no cardio. I know some will see this as a detriment, but I prefer to take my dogs for a brisk walk than do cardio from a DVD.

1831893,5,B000089QAP,I have just had 2 children in the past year and have a very bad back. This is perfect for me! I already had a ball that I had used as a birth ball and figured I'd give this a try. It is challenging enough that I couldn't get through even one of the 10 minute segments at first! I am looking forward to toning up with this dvd.,1293494400,3,326,3.739130434782609
1831894,4,B000089QAP,"Nice tape. Effective and short. Practiced regularly it will absolutely improve your tone and and build muscle. If you already have toned abs and stabilizers it will help you be accountable by ""just doing 10 minutes every day.""",1280620800,6,226,4.973684210526316
1831895,4,B000089QAP,This DVD provides additional workout for the stability ball. I wanted different programs so that I'm not doing the same exercises over and over.  Variety also keeps one from becoming bored.  I like the weights that can be used to help tone muscles.  My one complaint is that the warm-up segment could be shown slower and in steps as I'm having a problem getting the coordination down.  Other than that I'm pleased with this purchase.,1270857600,4,433,4.733333333333333
1831896,5,B000089QAP,"I have about 20 workout DVD's, and I use this one EVERY SINGLE DAY. Best investment ever, and it really works! After about two weeks of use I noticed a lot change.

1831897,5,B000089QAP,"This workout takes only 30 minutes but concentrates on all the essential areas for effective result.  The workout uses the stability ball and hand weights.  Doing exercise on a stability ball is very effective because you need to balance and concentrate; otherwise, you'd roll all over your mat!  It's great for your back, abs, and your upper body.  I use this DVD when I don't have the time but want to squeeze in some exercise.  Highly recommended for people on the go, including men!",1252540800,17,486,4.738095238095238
1831898,5,B000089QAP,"This is the first DVD that I have bought regarding stability ball workouts. It is a great workout. I like how the DVD is broken down into 3 segments upper,lower and abdominals. You can select only one workout to do or all three. The 10 minute countdown timer that is visible on the screen for each workout segment is a great feature. There is also someone on the DVD that demonstrates a modified workout at the same time the regular workout is being done.

1831899,5,B000089QAP,"I love the whole series.

Good strengthening DVD. Love that's it quick. You still need to do your cardio someplace else, but for toning...it's great!! I have had this video about 6 years and have not tired of it.

Love the exercises on the ball, very gentle to the body and the modifications are very do-able. Kellie is great too. Perfect for the time challenged!",1228435200,,363,4.569230769230769
1831900,5,B000089QAP,"I recently bought my first stability ball and wanted to learn more ways to use it. This DVD was perfect for that. The exercises are challenging and diverse. The instructor is wonderful and very clear, explaining the moves very well and even anticipating some of the things you may be doing wrong. It's not a boring workout, and certainly a nice change of pace from crunches!",1215820800,,374,4.681818181818182
1831901,5,B000089QAP,Bought this workout based on other's reviews. They hit the nail right on the head. If you are looking for a great first time exercise ball video. Here you go.,1208131200,,158,4.3
1831902,5,B000089QAP,This is a nicely rounded workout (no pun intended).  It covers 3 areas of conditioning and gives alternative exercises for those who need more support or less strain.,1207353600,,166,4.928571428571429
1831903,3,B000089QAP,"I was hoping the workouts would be a little more intense since they are broken up into 10 minute segments. It was really easy and didn't seem to challenge my muscles, perhaps if I do the whole routine 2 or three times it will be better.",1206921600,2,236,4.1521739130434785
1831904,4,B000089QAP,"Three ten-minute workouts targeting the upper and lower body plus the abs using the stability ball and weights.  There are modifications for beginner and intermediate-advanced.  Abs segment has the most challenging exercises.  Although, I like Keli Roberts, she was hard to follow because she started moving without giving cues-they just went straight to the exercises and I felt left behind.  To solve that, one should review the program beforehand and/or work at your own pace, or do it regularly to familiarize. This has been a regular on my rotation using the stability ball, but now, I prefer TLT Finding Your Core.",1205280000,,620,5.108910891089109
1831905,4,B000089QAP,"I am very pleased with the 3 workouts provided in this DVD.  I have trained on a stability ball with a personal trainer for some time and really enjoy the focused workouts, but I would not recommend this for beginners as it does not give a lot of instructions for correct posture.  This is very good for intermediate to advanced stability ball users.",1201996800,,350,4.5396825396825395
1831906,4,B000089QAP,"This is one of the good ones.  I enjoy working out with the ball and I feel like I get a decent burn.

The instructor moves quickly and, like many others have said here, there is no warm-up or cool-down.  I find myself often pausing to stetch out between excersises.

I pull this DVD out weekly.",1200355200,,295,4.214285714285714
1831907,5,B000089QAP,"Quick Fix was my first attempt at a stability ball routine. Most everyone I knew who had ever tried the ball didn't like it, so I was hesitant. But hey, I'll try anything when it comes to fitness.

I was very wobbly at first, but worked through it quickly enough. The instruction was easy to understand and follow without being annoying or overly perky. Now this is one of my favorite workouts. I do all three consecutively at least twice a week. I am amazed at how quickly the time goes. One or two of segments could easily be fit into a busy schedule during the day to beat the afternoon slump.

Don't let the thought of actually getting on a stability ball scare you off. You'll love this workout.",1199318400,2,700,4.376923076923077
1831910,5,B000089QAP,I love this ball. It is easy to use and is just the right size for me. I learned while shopping for a stability ball that size matters. I encourage everyone to thoroughly read Amazon's product descriptions. They are educational.,1196294400,2,228,4.725
1831911,3,B000089QAP,"This is definitely a good tool for learning about form and getting some ideas about different exercises to do on the stability ball. I didn't know who the instructor was before purchasing this, but it turns out she has a peppy Australian (?) accent and close to a fitness competitor's physique, in other words: very muscular. I was a little surprised, but she comes off as pleasant and friendly.

The three ten-minute segments are too short to do much, but they'll probably deliver on ""strengthening your muscles and improving your balance and coordination"" like the DVD says they will. Using it may help relieve any guilt about not exercising more than getting you in shape. But something is always better than nothing. I'm 5'1, under 100 lbs. and pretty active. My take on the segments:

1: Lower body -- There was only one exercise that I really felt working my muscles. Otherwise it was more balance and movement.

2: Arms and Back -- This section was probably the most informational for me. I came away with exercises to do on my own rather than wanting to repeat the DVD. The one thing I was disappointed with was that the exercises go back and forth (in no particular order) between arms, chest, back and shoulders. This isn't a good practice to follow for more serious workouts, especially with weights. It's generally more beneficial and safer to focus on working the big muscle groups first and then move on to supporting muscles, ie. back/chest then shoulders then arms. But I think the routine was designed this way so the exercises would flow easily due to positioning on the ball. Also, given the light weights used and minimal amount of time doing each exercise, the instructor (who obviously has a lot of knowledge) probably decided it wasn't vital.

3: Abs -- I'm not a sit-up person. In fact, I hate doing ab work. I almost never do, so I must have weak abs. But I didn't find this segment difficult or boring. Perhaps thats a negative and a positive.

There are three women demonstrating the exercises, one who does modified versions to make them easier. If you pay a lot of attention to form, you can get great results from this kind of exercise. This probably isn't an every-day, get results DVD. I bought it for $5 and, after watching it,  wouldn't have paid more. If you're a beginner and like workout videos or are just curious, it may be worth it. If you're advanced or work out regularly already, I don't know if you'll end up using it too often.",1184716800,8,2472,4.632420091324201
1831912,5,B000089QAP,"I was skeptical about the whole stability ball workout, however, I found this workout to be fun.  It's definitely one of those workouts I use when I know I need to workout but don't want to workout.  Don't get me wrong I had some trouble balancing on the ball but before too long, the 30 minutes has passed and I've done a session of strength training. I highly recommend this to beginners or advance exercisers.",1184198400,,412,4.48
1831913,5,B000089QAP,"This is my favorite workout dvd! It is thorough and the countdown clock is perfect for us impatient types who hate to work out and are constantly wondering when it will be over, LOL! With the exception of one or two positions, it is not overly complicated and most beginners can handle them. If you are older, out of shape/inflexible or have never done any ball exercises or yoga/pilates it may take you a minute to get used to-- just don't stress if you can't do some of the more advanced moves right away, you will find that 99% of it is still worthwhile.",1180915200,5,557,4.365384615384615
1831914,4,B000089QAP,"I have been working out steadily for a month and I wanted to break up my routine, so I decided to try the stability ball again.  I still had mine from like 10 years ago, so I thought that all I needed was a pump and I would be good to go!  Not so, I am on a very tight budget so I figured oh well, especially since at my local sporting goods store the cheapest ball was like 25 bucks!  So, I left discouraged, I had to go to Walmart and I decided to look and see if they had them and low and behold not only did they have the ball, but it was only 9 bucks!  So, now I had the ball and a very old tape with the workouts, again being on a tight budget, I went to Ross and found three stability ball workouts...can you believe it!  They were all under 7 dollars!  I bought the 10 minute solution stability ball workout and The Quick Fix workout.

I love both workouts, they both have great exercises.  I think the ab work on the Quick Fix is a bit more challenging and you don't ever have to get on the floor to do the workout, which I love!  There is no cardio or warm up, cool down or stretching on this video, but that isn't a problem for me because I run about 1 to 2 miles everyday so I get my cardio in and as far as stretching is concerned, get the 10 Minute Solution Stability Ball workout, it has a wonderful flexibility workout and a pretty good cardio workout!  If you do both tapes together you can get a darn good 50 minute workout!  Or do them seperately, if time is of the essence!  It doesn't matter what you do, just do it!",1178582400,4,1537,3.9385113268608416

You can do it altogether or only do part of it. The instructor is really helpful and the exercise is easy to pick up. You definitely will FEEL it after the exercise!!! Overall, this DVD is pretty good for beginners. The only downside is that it doesn't have much for warm-up, if you need some more warm-up before the exercise, you'll be on your own.",1173312000,7,515,4.26530612244898

I had liked the previous DVD in the series I had tried, and this Stability Ball workout did not disappoint me.  I have been in good shape in the past and within the past 2 weeks started exercising again regularly nearly every day.  Last week I started this DVD by trying the arms workout; I liked the way the instructor changed up the light and heavy weights for different exercises and LOVED the way the minutes count down in the right bottom corner.  POOF - I was done in no time.  AND feeling the burn the next day.  A few days later I tried the other segments, the lower body and abdominal targeting ones.  What I really enjoyed about all 3 sections was the innovation - they had exercises I had never seen before, which made it fresh and often even more fun instead of doing the same, boring, usual exercises.  I also was very impressed and appreciative of the fact that the ""abs"" part also included exercises for the back, particularly the lower back, which is nearly always forgotten in the usual exercise videos.  I highly recommend, and look forward to using this DVD often with good results!",1170460800,9,1271,4.439655172413793

At first I could only do one of the three workouts at a time, but recently I have been able to do the whole DVD, although it is still difficult for me. I like the fact that the DVD gives you the choice to do the whole routine or choose which part of the body you want to target (upper body, lower body and abs/back). And because each part of the overall workout routine is only 10 minutes long, it really fits in with my crazy schedule. On the more technical side, it's easy to get to the workout menu (some workout DVDs have huge amounts of ""junk"" to get through before getting to the actual workout), the sound is good quality, and for those who need to see the modifications, they do an excellent job of that. The editing is also paced well and you have time to actually position yourself on the ball, floor, etc. to start the exercises with the DVD, rather than ""catching up"" like with some.

The format of having 3 separate workouts of 10 minute length provides some nice flexibility.  Also, having variations for me as a beginner was nice so that I am not getting frustrated since I can't do the hard stuff yet.

1831938,3,B000089QAP,"The price of the Quick Fix Stability Ball Workout can't be beat, but the DVD is average at best. The workout is 30 minutes long, divided into three 10-minute segments that cover arms and back, lower body, and abdominal area.

The instructor does a fine job describing and executing the exercises with another girl doing the same moves, and there is another girl who demos easier versions. The production of the DVD is good as is the setting and music--what you would expect of any professional exercise DVD.

I didn't care for the emphasis on how much time was remaining for each section. A countdown clock appears in the lower righthand corner, and although that is considered a feature for those who can't wait for the ten minutes to be over, I'm more of the type who doesn't want to keep track, does the routine, and before I even realize it, I'm done.

Another peeve is that the exercises aren't creative or new. In fact, they are pretty conventional, and therefore, a bit boring if you already have some experience with ball routines.

If you exercise to just do it and get it over with and you don't want to spend a lot of money, this would probably be a good buy. If you are looking for a DVD to complement your existing at-home or gym workouts, there are better ones out there.",1140048000,12,1285,4.502145922746781

I don't really know what level I would classify myself at, I usually run about 2-3 miles to get my cardio in 4-5 times a week if that means anything. But I wanted to start toning a bit more so I got a stability ball for home and this workout. It is made up of three segments divided into ten minutes a piece, upper body, lower body, and abs. The abs section is a favorite of mine because you also work on your back which is ultra necessary if you are trying to shrink your middle. You never have to get down on the floor to do a single crunch, I love that! I loved this DVD because with all of my other DVD's that I have there is always a move or two that I hate but can't skip because I feel like I will miss targeting that area, for me it is the T-stands in all the pilates videos, I hate them and have a knee I dislocated last May so I can't really do them these days. But this video every exercise is effective and I don't dread a certain move. It is only 30 minutes but you will definately feel it the next day and a couple of the moves I am still doing the modifications hoping to work up to the advanced levels, so this can definately be used by everybody. The instructor is encouraging but not annoying and you change up the moves during the sets so you are always focusing on something besides what you are doing. For example, your third set of shoulder presses you start lifting opposite legs while sitting on the ball. I find myself concentrating so much on staying on the ball I forget my shoulders are burning. I have tried a ton of DVDs and this one I have really stuck to and enjoyed.

You can do all 3 for a good overall toning workout, or just the sessions you like if you are in a hurry or just want to concentrate on a particular part of your body.  This is NOT a cardio workout...strictly toning.

All of the exercises are fairly easy and simple to do, yet extremely effective.  If you haven't worked out in awhile, you will feel it the next day.

I select which muscle group that I would like to work on each day. I sometimes do 2 of them or the whole DVD depending on how much time I have. Or you can  just work on one of the muscle groups.

One of the three girls is always showing an alternative to the moves for beginners.  The main girl is very pleasant and to the point, not cutesy or trying to be funny.  If you pay attention to what you're doing and are deliberate in the moves, you'll definitely feel it!  If I only have time for one of the exercises, I still feel like I got a good workout and it was better than not exercising at all.  I really like the timer in the corner because you can see how much time you have left, or if you're really getting into it, you'll be surprised how quickly the time passes!

However, they lift weights at a very quick pace. Professional trainers have told me (I wouldn't know) that lifting slowly increases effectiveness so... this might not be as effective.",1117238400,24,475,4.523255813953488

I love DVDs that I have to go through a few times before I can master it. My only complaint, like some others have noted, is that it is too short. I wish the Quick Fix series had at least 4 or 5 segments. I just don't feel like I get enough of a work-out in thirty minutes.

1831954,5,B000089QAP,"Using a ball is an effective way to do exercises that otherwise put a lot of stress on your joints when done on the floor.  The reviewer who said that this is a waste of time has obviously not done the exercises properly.  It is also not accurate to say that someone would have to be very unhealthy in order to sweat.  Just because you don't sweat, doesn't mean you are not working hard.  I work out all the time, and still feel challenged when using the ball.  I have used stability balls in exercise classes, and most people also agree that they are very useful.  Using a ball takes the weight off your joints, which allows you to focus on doing the exercises properly without hurting yourself.  Having to stabilize your ""core"" also works the muscles harder.  Don't be fooled at how easy it looks.  Once you try it, you will notice your muscles working.",1112832000,16,855,4.42948717948718
1831955,5,B000089QAP,"Enjoyable and effective workout for the whole body, especially the core muscles.  I have a bad back, so I do the 10-minute session on back & abs every morning plus a few push-ups and bridges with the ball.  Two or three times a week I fit in the whole 30-minute workout, with 5- & 8-lb weights.

To be safe I went through it with my physical therapist and he was impressed at the well-thought out working of all the major muscle groups without anything harmful (although he did recommend doing some sections at a slower pace, and not lifting your arms too high on the side weight lift).

A couple of modifications I like that I got off of other tapes:

--In the Back & Abs section: For the back extensions, try bracing your feet against a door or wall.  You can work your back more effectively if your feet are securely braced instead of sliding along the floor.  (I don't have a yoga mat; maybe they give you a better grip than carpet or linoleum but the door method sure works for me.)

--In the Lower Body section: Instead of doing the single-leg bridge exercizes (which put a lot of strain behind my knees) I do a set with the ball close up to my knees instead of under my heels.  And then a set with my legs bent and the soles of my feet planted against the ball instead of the floor.  Each set works different muscles and works my spine in a different way, which feels great to my bad back.

I tried two Gaiam tapes at the local gym (which I thought were totally worthless), then bought this one and three others, but this is the one that's Just Right and almost the only one I ever actually use!  Nothing in it is a problem for my back, no time is wasted, it's not too hard but since you control how you do each exercize it's a good resistance workout whatever your fitness level, the pace is great...and the price is right!  You can't beat it.",1112313600,44,1851,4.2542857142857144
1831956,4,B000089QAP,"I thought I'd give the stability ball workouts a try and I really enjoy this particular workout.  This workout video is a great way to help you get back in shape after having a baby.  Having had a baby three months ago, I was itching to get back into an exercise routine, especially since I was essentially housebound with little one in the cold weather. This is a great workout even if you're already in shape from running or biking, but need to work on core strengthening.  I was in shape before my pregnancy and even though all was not lost in the 9 months, I still found it challenging.

There are three focus areas in this video--the upper body, lower body, and abs.  Each focus area is given a ten minute segment, giving you a 30 minute workout.  All of the exercises focus on strengthening and core stability.  There are no cardio exercises, so if that's what you're looking for, I recommend that you do this video as a supplement to walking, running, or some kind of other exercise that incorporates a cardio workout.

The upper body workout requires you to use two sets of weights--one lighter set and one heavier set.  Obviously you also need a stability ball for this workout.  Although a yoga mat is nice, it is not a necessity.

You can use the modification exercises at first if you're just starting to get in shape, but then overtime, you can do the exercises without the modificiations and start increasing the level of weights.  Just like any workout video out there, what you put into it is what you get out of it.  Its really up to you to challenge yourself in this workout once you master the exercises.

This video is especially good for beginners and those looking for a great post-natal workout.  I highly recommend this video!",1111881600,11,1750,4.546325878594249

She does a good job instructing in this video, very pleasant and has a neat accent. She has 2 other exercisers with her one of which performs the beginner modifications.

This video is divided into three 10 minute segments, lower body, upper body and abs. You can choose to do one or all three of them depending on your schedule. The lower body segment does a good job targeting the hamstrings especially, but hits the inner thighs and rest of the legs and ""backyard"" as Keli refers to it as well. The upper body requires 2 sets of dumbells, lighter and heavier. You will work all the upper body muscles, shoulders, back, biceps, chest and triceps, some of which where you are lifting one arm and lifting the opposite leg. Good way to work on balance and core stability this way. Finally you work the abs and back, there is a set of reverse crunches at the end which are tough, I always have a fire in my abs after I am done with those.

This is a good video for those new to ball work, like myself, some may feel it is too easy but it is the perfect level for me.",1110067200,9,1191,4.1965065502183405

I have tried to master the ""pike"" move many times before based on pictures in magazines, etc., but until I got this video I only succeeded in crashing into my coffee table.  After I got the video, I got the pike move down on the first try!  The DVD is definitely worth the price, since she shows you a lot of really creative ways to work different muscles with the ball.  The segments are only ten minutes long, which might not do much for you if you're used to working out, but I do the segments twice to get enough of a workout, and that works pretty well.  One small complaint is that you need to buy weights for the upper body segment, but if you already have weights, it's a really good workout.

My abs needed something new and my balance has always been bad due to mild curvature of my spine. Also, I have one ankle that has always been swollen since childhood, so my hamstrings and calves needed lots of work. I felt kind of silly using the stability ball at first but WOW what changes I have seen!

 The Quick Fix workout is excellent, especially the hamstring  and back exercises. Kelli is a wonderful instructor and no time is wasted in the 30 minutes, the workout is surprisingly effective for upper and lower body and abs and it is never dull. I actually look forward to it and find it fun, and I can feel it working, so it is challenging. What's more, it has given me results FAST, in combination with my other workouts,and it has helped me break through my plateau.

I love how my balance has improved and how my inner thighs and abs have tightened. The ball uses muscles I didn't know I had, I can actually see my hamstrings now. Also, I had considered buying a weight bench for pec flies but with the ball there is no need for that, I can do them on the ball, and work my abs and core at the same time. This workout is worth the money and I really am glad I have it!",1093392000,28,1383,4.184210526315789
1831962,4,B000089QAP,"I've been using this DVD for about three weeks now, when I don't feel like biking or walking, and I highly recommend it for people who have maybe had a little Pilates/yoga/weight work instruction and just want to come at it all from a different perspective. Make no mistake: Being on a ball doesn't make it easier! It makes you 'get real' about your posture and etc. Your muscles will bark back at you, especially on the lower body segment, but you'll feel pleased and proud when you complete it. The instructions are compassionate; the 'instructresses' are cheery and motivating. The background music doesn't sound like something from a (...) movie. And it's all over in a half-hour! If nothing else, this video will coax you out of a bad mood -- and maybe, after time, into a smaller pair of pants!",1089676800,15,800,4.640845070422535
1831963,3,B000089QAP,"Not a bad little disc, three workouts, but I only do the third one. Our instructor has a nice little British accent, which is somehow refreshing. Also refreshing is that she is -yikes!- a little older. But, look at that tummy! And I appreciate having one of the three chicks doing modified versions (am I out of shape)! No, you won't sweat, but I'm old and cranky and this works for me. Oh, and I don't think you'll ever talk a man into doing those pelvic moves on that big ball, if you do, let me know.",1086134400,12,503,4.195876288659794
1831964,5,B000089QAP,"I""m quite pleased with this DVD. The reviewer giving it one star was probably looking for an aerobic workout. This DVD is for toning. It's divided into three sections with a ten minute countdown in the corner of the screen. If you want more reps, simply repeat. Which is so easy to do on the DVD.The instructor is a bit intimidating physically with her six pack abs, but her commentary isn't intimidating whatsoever. I liked her Aussie accent. It's nice to have modifications too if you need them.",1085616000,4,497,4.659090909090909
1831965,5,B000089QAP,"This is a great strength training dvd using a stability ball. Workout is divided into 3 10 minute sessions targeting abs, legs and arms. Two pairs of weights are needed. This is a great ""quick"" workout that moves along well & is very challenging. Highly recommend!",1084233600,7,264,4.760869565217392
1831966,1,B000089QAP,I don't know how anyone could sweat w/ this workout unless they were terribly unhealthy.  This is easier than chewing.  Waste of money and time.,1083801600,5,144,4.72
1831967,5,B000089QAP,"I love this workout! It's great. It includes three-10 minute sessions: Lower Body, Arms & Back, and Abs. You can do individually, or all together. This was my first balance ball DVD and I still use it regularly. It is upbeat and only as hard as you make it.
Please check my other workout and yoga DVDs.",1081209600,5,302,4.315789473684211
1831968,4,B000089QAP,"I love this workout. It moves very quickly, but I found it quite challenging. I bought my stability ball with the Gaiam videos featuring Suzanne Deason, and I didn't like those at all--they seemed very slow to me, and not very challenging. I wanted to get more out of my ball, so I tried this one.  Much better! Keli is a great instructor; no unnecessary chipperiness. I can feel my balance and strength improving each time I do it. My only complaint is that there is no stretching at the end of the segments, so you'll have to do those on your own. The use of the stability ball as a weight bench during the upper body is brilliant--you get much more out of your dumbbells when you're also focusing on balance.",1075248000,25,711,4.386363636363637
1831969,5,B000089QAP,"These workouts are fast and effective.  They are only for toning, so I usually add one or two to a cardio workout.  There are many creative uses of the stability ball in all of these workouts, and the instructor moves through the exercises quickly and gets a lot done in 10 minutes.  The upper body segments requires heavy and light weights thought I found  using five pound weights for both effective especially the first few times.  Some of the exercises are difficult the first time, but there are alternatives for beginners.  A lot of the exercises in all the workouts require good balance and core stability.",1056844800,99,613,4.735849056603773
