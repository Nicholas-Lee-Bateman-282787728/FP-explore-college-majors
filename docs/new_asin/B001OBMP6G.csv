3729618,4,B001OBMP6G,"I grew up watching the greats of US motocross. Hannah, O'Mara, Bailey, Jeff Ward, and Ricky Johnson.  Jeremy showed up in the 250 class in 1993. Showtime showed everyone else his backside for the next decade in stadiums across the country. RC may be ""The GOAT"", and the records showed that he was the best MOTOCROSS racer ever, but the King of Supercross will always be Jeremy. He did more for the sport than anyone can imagine, and helped propel SX from a once a week highlight on ""Motoworld"", to same day and sometimes live event on Speed. This video is Prime Time Showtime!",1291420800,10,576,4.538461538461538
3729619,2,B001OBMP6G,I bought this for my son's 7th birthday.  Unfortunately there was way too much sexual content and fowl language for him to watch it,1424044800,2,131,4.458333333333333

3729625,1,B001OBMP6G,"I ordered this DVD with the expectations that it would be more of a documentary on Jeremy McGrath and his vitories ... I was wrong.  Instead it is more like a collection of race clips from all different years.  No indeth interviews, and very grainy video.
Very dissapointed to say the least.",1393200000,2,291,4.576923076923077
3729626,1,B001OBMP6G,"This video is an absolute junk.  When they say ""You'll see Supercross legends like Jeremy McGrath, Jeff Emig, Mike LaRocco, etc."", it should say, ""You will see a brief grainy shot of someone crashing, and it may be a legend of the sport"". It says ""Supercross Kings"", but it is just a jumbled mess of old crash footage and some race coverage to a ""punk"" rock soundtrack.  Much of the coverage is not even supercross or even motocross.  There is no commentary or structure to this video.  Don't waste your money.  Not even worth a rental fee.  Watch supercross on Speed Channel or on the internet and save some dough.  Or purchase the ""Moto"" series of videos or watch it streaming on Netflix or Amazon.  Don't get suckered like I did.  This video is amateur at best.  This is just boring drivel thrown together by hacks.",1374451200,6,818,4.541095890410959
