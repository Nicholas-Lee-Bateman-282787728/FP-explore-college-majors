A man wants to paint a tree and he talks to his friends... Out of this comes a profound analysis of art and life. It is a movie I want to see many times so that as I grow and age and hopefully gain wisdom I will see more and more within it.  If you love art, film, light through leaves, talking with your friends, pondering life, then this film was made for you - although I thought the director made it just for me.",1196035200,2,573,4.008771929824562
7941230,5,B00005JOB5,"Antonio Lopez Garcia -a famed Spanish painter- intends to paint a Quincy tree, and the set of dynamic factors around it. The essence of the light, and the febrile but calm intensity that will nourish this simple fact, will arouse an intense and brilliant allegory of life and bliss. Hardly you will be able to find previous artistic traces in the past. Autumnal reminiscences, the warmth friendship of his colleagues and that epic commitment will convey us to one of the most inspired and superb Spanish masterworks of this peculiar Spanish filmmaker.

Absolutely rewarding!",1192838400,,574,5.1063829787234045
