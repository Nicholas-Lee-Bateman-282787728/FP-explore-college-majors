2128494,3,B0002W4UMK,"Postal Inspector is an interesting little movie from Universal. The film's real star is Ricardo Cortez. Cortez played Sam Spade in the original version of the Maltese Falcon long before Bogart made movie history with the role in the famous remake. Lugosi co-stars as a music promoter/night club manager who is forced into committing a crime to pay off a debt. The movie itself is quite strange, yet very entertaining. It's part love story, comedy, musical, drama, and crime story! Alpha Video who released this DVD specializes in offering rare, offbeat and little known titles, in fact I have never seen this film being offered by any other video company. Unfortunately, Alpha was not able to get a really good print of this movie to work with. It appears that they spliced together scenes from at least two different copies of Postal Inspector to makeup one complete version. The difference between each is quite noticeable in terms of both video & audio, one version looks really soft and digitized, and to be honest neither is really very good. Quality issues aside, it's still watchable and the cast is excellent. There are some great comedy moments, plenty of action, and some spectacular special effects - especially the footage of a flood. This film represents the final movie made by Bela Lugosi to fulfill his original Universal contract, the one that gave us DRACULA. It's a shame that the source material for Postal Inspector isn't any better. Hopefully, there's a pristine copy hidden somewhere in one of Universal Studios film vault's waiting to be discovered and issued someday. This version is recommended, but with some reservation.",1396051200,,1648,5.018248175182482
2128495,3,B0002W4UMK,"Fraud, money laundering and theft are the order of the day in this run-of-the-mill gangster movie/musical (!). Without going into too much detail, Lugosi is the well-dressed villain of the piece. The postal inspector of the title (Ricardo Cortez) is his main rival.

If you can withstand the occasional musical interludes, there are a few good scenes with Lugosi in this non-horror role.",1360454400,,387,5.142857142857143
2128496,4,B0002W4UMK,"I am a big fan of Lugosi and I have all his films.
Some of the cheap ones he made I admit are not
very good except for the fact he is in them!
I know many don't like this but I think this
is one of his best. The title sounds stupid
but I guess back then it was a big deal. I
bought this on video years ago and it broke
and I haven't seen in a while. I'm replacing
it today. I love this movie! I think the story
is well written good acting and I love the
flood scene. Lugosi plays a great gangster
villian. He's not a monster or mad doctor!
I think it you like Lugosi you'll like this!",1313884800,4,584,3.68
2128497,3,B0002W4UMK,I haven't watched this. It was given as a gift. Sorry. The actual transaction was fine. No problems.,1241481600,,100,4.611111111111111
2128498,1,B0002W4UMK,"This film, the last of Lugosi's original Universal contract, is weird, to say the least. At times it's like a compressed serial; at times it's a musical; at times it's an infomercial for the US postal service. All of this is incidental, because Lugosi is on hand, giving his characteristically intense and sincere performance. What's deplorable, however, is the print quality. It's absolutely awful, one of the worst I've ever seen on DVD. Some scenes (or, often, parts of scenes) look like they were shot through waxed paper. Would that some philanthropic movie maven would squander his inheritance on making GOOD restorations of these old gems!",1140912000,7,646,5.10377358490566
2128499,2,B0002W4UMK,"The Alpha version of Postal Inspector is of very poor video quality.  Otherwise, it may have been an interesting mishmash in what was Bela's last film under his original Universal contract.  The stock footage of the flood is spectacular.",1124582400,4,237,5.051282051282051
8033659,3,B0002W4UMK,"A fast-paced Universal programmer with gangsters, romance, comic relief, musical interludes, newsreel footage, chases, floods, mail fraud, Bela Lugosi and Hattie McDaniel. Running only 58 minutes, ""Postal Inspector"" (1936) is a wild ""B-movie"" ride undeserving of its  public-domain obscurity. Fourth-billed Lugosi makes the most of his limited role as a debt-ridden nightclub owner. Director Otto Brower also co-helmed ""The Phantom Empire""  the genre-bending 1935 serial that launched Gene Autry's film career.",1512777600,,510,6.169014084507042

8033661,3,B0002W4UMK,"A perfectly awful film, but a must for fans of the post office. Lugosi plays a supporting role in a film that includes an airplane in a thunderstorm, gangsters, a flood, a speedboat chase, musical interludes with a perfectly awful song, an unlikely love story and postal heroes.",1489968000,,278,4.8125
8033662,2,B0002W4UMK,"The only two reasons that this movie has any appeal is the mail processing visuals of the inside of an actual Postal Facility in the mid 1930s, and the depiction of early fraudulent products that were advertised in 3rd class mail matter and delivered via U.S. Parcel Post.  The Postal Inspection Service has always combated Mail Fraud.  Historically, this film has some value.  As entertainment, this film must be given a very low rating.",1486598400,,438,4.891891891891892
