5049623,5,B0072GPQNG,"Since his films have accumulated somewhere in the neighborhood of $7.5 billion overall, and following the Oscar wins as Best Director in 1993 for SCHINDLER'S LIST, and 1998 for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, director Steven Spielberg can pretty much make any film he wants, and not worry about whether it has commercial potential or not.  Because of this, it should become second nature to sophisticated movie fans to expect the unexpected from the man.  This is the case with his epic World War I drama WAR HORSE, one of the best films of 2011.

Based on Michael Morpurgo's book of the same name, and set in England and mainland Europe during World War I, WAR HORSE stars Jeremy Irvine as a young English lad who trains a seemingly unsuited-for-farming horse that his well-meaning but doddering father (Peter Mullan), much to the chagrin of his mother (Emily Watson), picked up at an auction in their hometown of Devon.  Irvine manages to train this horse to be a solid plowing animal and also learns to ride it with sureness and dispatch...that is, until World War I breaks out, and he has to hand over the horse to the English army, which needs every able-bodied man and animal possible (this being before motor vehicles and airplanes came into being in warfare).  The rest of the film depicts this war horse's journeys throughout war-torn France, until Irvine is finally reunited with his long-lost companion after he has become an enlisted English soldier and almost been killed in a gas attack during some intense trench warfare.

It is very tempting to think that Spielberg took on this project because it involved the interaction of animals with humans, but that would have been extremely obvious (not to mention dubious and manipulative as well).  Anyone who knows anything about Spielberg's filmic output, however, knows that so many of his films have tended to be set in the past, like the World War II settings of SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN; the America of the 1830s for the 1997 film AMISTAD; and the America of the 1960s for 2002's CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.  In WAR HORSE, Spielberg goes back close to a full century to World War I, which was supposed to be the War To End All Wars; and while what he depicts in the situations involving either Irvine, the horse itself, or both of them is not as graphic or heartbreaking as what he showed in SCHINDLER'S LIST or PRIVATE RYAN, he is still true to the historical fact of the earlier war, with its depiction of cavalry troops, trenches, and the first-ever use of chemical weaponry in war, where thousands of troops on either side were killed or burned by it.

There are unavoidable, albeit unintentional, references in WAR HORSE to other past films that are among the director's favorites, such as the depiction of Irvine's English homestead, reminiscent of John Ford's 1952 classic THE QUIET MAN and Stanley Kubrick's 1975 18th century period piece BARRY LYNDON; and the scenes of World War I echo Kubrick's 1957 classic PATHS OF GLORY (the scenes in the trenches), and Lewis Milestone's 1930 World War I epic ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT.  But Spielberg is a good enough director to let those references slip in via the storyline itself and not by his direction, which is as good as anything he has done throughout his career.  More than just a depiction of war, family, and human/animal interaction, WAR HORSE is, at its heart, clearly a human drama of the first order, a triumph of the human spirit, in which humanity's best comes out to balance off its worst traits.  John Williams' music score, with its combination of British and Irish influences, is one of his best as well; and the largely unknown English cast (excepting Watson) is excellent as well.  WAR HORSE can, in the final analysis, be counted as yet one more feather in the cap for Spielberg and his cinematic canon.",1324857600,29,3846,4.748125937031484
5049624,5,B0072GPQNG,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. After seeing it at the theater today I came onto Amazon, as I often do, to add it to my wishlist. I then read the unexcited reviews currently found on the page and thought I should write a review to posit a counter opinion. The other reviews currently posted don't seem to have enjoyed the film, two major criticisms being that they found it melodramatic and heavy handed, comments like these make me wonder if audiences have become so cynical that they view any attempt at displaying open/honest emotion to be an attempt at manipulation. Everyone has differing opinions but I feel this film will appeal to anyone who enjoys stylistically well made films and/or anyone who enjoys stories about bonds/will being tested. In a general sense Spielberg uses the story of this horse to explore the human condition and explore some very well done set pieces/environments.

As I saw it, the horse is a metaphor for hope and how it can be shared and spread, how it can inspire and endure. I don't mean this in an oversentimental way but just in a very real way. We are all hopeful for different things, big and small, and this film is about how under the right conditions and with the right persistence that hope can avoid being snuffed out or lost.

The film, based on a play I have not seen and cannot compare it to, is episodic as the horse goes from owner to owner during the years of World War 1. The fact that the film was episodic didn't make it feel chopped up or give it the feel of a broken narrative. I felt the throughline of the film was the human condition and the travelling horse facilitated the telling of several viewpoints while exploring the excellent recreation of a time period. The acting was top notch by everyone seen on screen. To counter another criticism, the main human character, a boy named Albert, does show strong affection for the horse, a character in the film quips ""come on now boy, it's not as if he were a dog"". I didn't find this relationship to be strange, the horse simply becomes very important to Albert because as we see he doesn't have much to his life and the horse is something he gets that then works to make his life better. Perhaps I also never found it strange as I always found the horse to be representative of hope rather than as just some random animal.

The writing in terms of dialogue flowed and felt incredibly natural, as it does in most Spielberg films. John Williams score, while clearly a John Williams score, is the perfect mix of innocence, action/adventure and drama as the story calls for it. I would strongly compare the pacing and acting to Catch Me if You Can, as that film also had several major settings that shifted as the film progressed. I found War Horse to actually be better paced as it has a few more settings (about 5, possibly 6 in total?) and each one is shorter than the ones in the aforementioned film. Best of all the film actually ends when it ends, the story concludes and there are no tacked on or forced endings for the sake of pandering or overexplaining as many recent films have had.

As far as the directing, I don't know if one can compare anything to the seeming effortless magic he created in his early films or certain efforts from the 90's but this would be Spielberg above his recent best and closer to those older films in quality. Everything unfolds visually in such an easy to follow an familiar way while still being unique and involving. There are some masterful shots that recall the opening of Saving Private Ryan but in an artistically different way. This is unquestionably due in part to the fact that this film has been made family friendly, while that could serve as a criticism I didn't find the film to be aimed specifically at families, though it has been made to fascilitate viewing by younger children. Rather than illustrating the pure violence of battle as he did in SPR, Spielberg spends his time in this film showing the brutality of war in a creative fashion that suggests the horror more than displaying it. There is one such scene in particular where mounted soldiers ride into battle and on the other end of the shot their empty horses emerge without many of the riders they once carried.

In a sea of films about special effects, high concept stories or big names here is a film that is a complete film on its own without any gimmicks, as fun as gimmicks can be (Mi4 for example). This film is an actual experience for those who are open to it. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was an excellently crafted film that pushed the dark and grittiness, War Horse is a excellently crafted film that pushes the lighter elements but both are equally enjoyable and excellently made. Watching a good Spielberg film is like watching the epitome of what film is. It's like more recently watching Christopher Nolan's films, there are always flaws in any film but films such as theirs are so carefully and purposefully made as films that they are engaging and fully engrossing.

One potential weakness I will admit, though I feel a reviewing of the film would diminish it, is that the film doesn't have as strong an arc as most films. The characters change but so much of it is internal here. The horse's first owner does change but he is absent through the middle of the film, the various other owners also change in varying ways but all during their own vignettes. The horse itself has changed in much the same way as his owner as suggested by the final shot of the film, but perhaps critical audience members won't pick up on this. That said, one could (and I would say should) view this subtlety as purposeful. The film isn't as much about how the boy or the horse has changed but how despite all they've been through they managed to stay so much the same, they maintain what could easily have been lost.

I dunno, I personally love it (5 Stars) but for objectivity I'll give it 4/5 for general audiences, I think most everyone I described at the beginning of this review will like this film if they view it. For those who feel it is heavy handed and melodramatic go and watch Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, its also an excellent film but there is no overt display of emotion to be found there. Thanks for your time",1324857600,84,6245,4.516357206012378
5049625,3,B0072GPQNG,"A random walk through World War I. By a horse.

Made in Classic Hollywood style, the film is populated by good actors, beautiful (or beautifully horrible) sets, and a grand vision. While the individual segments are fine, they do not come together to create a whole which is greater than the parts. In fact the whole may be less than the sum of its parts, diminished by mawkishly transparent manipulation of the audience.

Spielberg is a master manipulator but here the hand of the master is a bit heavy.",1324857600,3,503,4.640449438202247

5049655,3,B0072GPQNG,"Telling stories through the eyes of a horse who passes through the lives of various humans is an interesting but odd gimmick. Evidently it worked on the page, and with large horse puppets on the stage. But trying to adapt it into a live action film with an actual horse as his star brought out the best and worst in Spielberg. He's at his best in the scenes of war, not quite as grim as Private Ryan but still pretty sobering. At other times he gives in completely to his tendencies for cornball schmaltz, depicting the farmers of Devon like Hobbits in the shire, and playing up the young man's romance with his horse to such a high pitch it began to strike me as a little unseemly. John Williams is of course right there with him, with a score that often sounds like it came from a Fifties Disney movie. Since it's all about the boy and his horse, scenes with other characters amount to little more than quickly passing vignettes that pad the movie out to two hours. Not a bad film, but not a very good one, and very far from one of Spielberg's best.",1520726400,,1051,4.313131313131313

Jeremy Irvine plays ""Albert"" (aka ""Albie""), a young Frenchman who raises a horse from its birth and calls it ""Joey"" (no kidding), thereby setting this quite brave and confident equine epic in motion as we witness Albert's ascension into manhood and his remarkable bond with Joey, enveloped around World War I, no less (the viewer also gets an unexpected but welcome perspective of Joey's transition between owners, with Joey's future very much lying in the balance).  Irvine bares a noticeable resemblance to Marco Hofschneider in the slightly better ""Europa Europa"" (and there are shades of that film here), but there's no denying that ""War Horse"" is a grand and sprawling spectacle that is recommended for both genders and all ages, whether or not you love horses.",1517443200,,923,4.910256410256411

5049743,5,B0072GPQNG,"Originally saw this movie on the Christmas Day it was released (2011) and there was not a dry eye in the theater.  Bought it this past Christmas to watch with my now teenage daughter and she loved it as well.  The second time through still brought an occasional tear!  The story line is exceptional, the acting is fabulous and Spielberg once again raises the bar for cinematic genius.  I am not sure how many horses were used to play ""Joey"", but as horse people, it was fun for us to spot the ""actor"" changes.  The story chronicles the life of Joey, not first person as Black Beauty did, but chapter by chapter throughout the course of World War I in England and Europe.  Throughout the script, we see how many lives Joey touches, and the film also very thoughtfully, poignantly, and victoriously reveals the culture and mindset of the time.  Well worth two hours on the sofa with a bowl of popcorn and a box of tissues!",1493769600,3,920,4.473053892215569

5049898,4,B0072GPQNG,Nice story.  Does not look like a thoroughbred.  Of course 14 horses played different parts.  He looks to Roman nosed to me in the cover picture.  Secretariat is a better movie.  And a true story ... bias ... my horse is related to Secretariat multiple time (Bold Ruler too) -- line breeding.  He is an amazing animal.  In one scene for a split second you see him with a large blaze like my horse -- turns out they used four horses to film the movie -- must have forgot the makeup for that split second!,1478649600,,503,4.231578947368421

5049910,5,B0072GPQNG,"Excellent book. I use it to teach kids how to read properly, and it works like a charm. The kids are into it big-time. I show them the movie at the same time, and that just enhances the learning process. I wouldn't recommend it for kids younger than 7, but all ages after that..definitely.

The story is about a young man who ends up with a colt he has to teach, so he can maintain his farm. Unfortunately, the horse is eventually thrust into a war and separated from the boy.

It's a very interestinh, yet heart-wrenching story that makes you realize what many had to go through during various wars, and it doesn't just grip you in the beginning. It holds your attention all the way to the the final pages, with a magnificent end. Truly, a tear-jerker, without being mushy. I highly recommend it for all ages.",1477180800,3,810,4.429530201342282

5049916,1,B0072GPQNG,"This movie is one of the worst things I've watched in a while. It's basically a story about a man in love with a horse and how the horse comes back to him like the damsel in distress he is. Think Equus but without all the interesting stuff. While there's many an interesting or hilarious film to be made about inter-species love as proven by the Jerry Springer show and all the times I caught people in college watching training videos on the matter, this movie is not one of those films. It seems less interested in dealing with the fact that a young, handsome man is deathly in love with a farm animal instead of a dishy blonde cutie that seemed to be a potential love interest than it does in showing how anyone not German in WW 1 was a terrible classless creep or an emasculated male. Yep, you're either in love with farm animals, a classless bore, an old man playing grandma to cute little girls, or sucking at life unless you're a fine, cultured German chap. Steven Spielberg's disgusting German love rears it's head again. Much like Saving Private Ryan, he doesn't think those German fellows are all bad. You probably shouldn't shoot them even thought they're on the other side of war shooting at you. They might even come back and kill your friends with their friends but you should let their friends go anyway cause you know those German fellows are swell. In a way, he's I guess proving his point by showing himself to be a classless bore who promotes a country filled with drunk creeps who started 2 world wars and still fester Antisemitism by hiding it in pro-Palestinian rhetoric. Needless to say, I hate this movie.

Oh the best part of the movie is an accident. The sun is supposed to be lighting the horse like a giant holy light around it but the horse takes a step off it's mark. It cause the sun to illuminate the horse's genital area. Like a big giant holy light is flying out between it's legs at the audience. They could've removed this in editing but thankfully Spielberg is so lazy, dumb, and artistically bankrupt that it stayed in.",1476403200,,2057,4.485333333333333

5050011,3,B0072GPQNG,"This is a pretty depressing WW1 film, and it is based on a child's fiction story.  I personally would not let a child see the film.  It is war, and there is violence against the people and the animals.  For the adult viewer, ome great actors have small roles, such as Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hiddleston.  The horse is beautiful. That's about all I can say, good and bad.  If the story interests you, read the book - it isn't so graphic.",1461456000,,441,4.329268292682927

5050014,3,B0072GPQNG,"Let me begin by saying I liked this movie... my problem is that I have such a hard time watching any kind of movie where animals are placed in painful/harmful scenarios.  I know they aren't real, but I react every time.  Having said that... I may not be the best person to review this movie.  My empathy with the horses caused me to be anxious throughout, making it difficult to stay in the story.  Actually, I'm surprised I made it through this movie.  I came close to turning it off several times.  If you are less animal-empathetic, one would like this movie.",1461110400,,562,4.46078431372549

5050047,3,B0072GPQNG,"People who know nothing about horses should not <write books/write plays/write movies/insert media here> about them. There were so many cringe moments in this movie. There were also many ""What? Horses don't act/react like that"" And, believe me, one strand of barbed wire is more than enough to maim or kill a horse. That was a ""Oh, come on."" moment. <sigh>

And there were times I wondered where the title horse was. Seems the title horse was played by 17 (!!) horses, who looked significantly different, even with the badly painted mark on the horse's forehead. <sigh>

The movie was filmed as if it were on a stage. Everything felt tight, close, too stylized, very theatrical. The translation from stage to screen denied the screenplay any feeling of scope or reality. It was too faithful. <sigh>

My husband who loves any kind of horse story loved it. I had to cover my mouth and not groan. 3 stars is 2.5 stars rounded up because I love my husband. <sigh>",1458172800,,959,4.662721893491124

If you read the novel or saw the play, you would enjoy the film about a horse deemed a loser and became heroic during World War One. The film is a breathtaking portrait and story about a horse and the people in his life.

The DVD includes a short six minutes feature and I wished there was more with regards to features. The DVD's only drawback is lack of extras. The film is perfect for family and classroom viewing. The author and his wife made cameos in the film. The author Michael Morpurgo doesn't appear in the only feature.",1442880000,,736,4.6106870229007635

5050202,4,B0072GPQNG,"I really love this film. Not only the part how this movie describes human condition but also the historical part of the movie. I highly recommend this stylistically well made movie because it is just so amazing when I see the horse jumping around the field and bring hopes to the people in the Great War.
The background of the movie happened during the World War I. The horse, named Joey, did not give up on his life during the Great War. Joey brought hopes to the devastated soldiers on both Allies and Germans. During World War I, millions of people died because the war was fought in a different way, as known as trench war. Generals make soldiers dig trenches to make defiance and it makes the offence become very hard, and even more, the troops are already using machine guns from the beginning of the war and millions of people will die under the machine guns. When Joey ran in to the field, there are wires and bodies everywhere. Suddenly, Joey was trapped in the wires and both Germans and British soldiers cant believe what they are seeing  a living animal at the middle of the war zone. The appeared of Joey makes both German and British send a soldiers to help rescue him and that makes troops on both sides disengage for a while. After Joey was rescued, he was send back to the doctor for surgery and at the same place is where he met his original owner, Albert. After the war, Joey and Albert went back to home together and the movie end with a happy ending.
After watching the whole movie, I can feel the powerful vitality spreading from Joey, miracles happened on this creature. He makes me believe that I shouldnt give up on anything. Really, everyone should go watch this movie. It definitely worth it.",1440979200,2,1719,4.492012779552716

5050221,5,B0072GPQNG,"In the spring of 1914, in Devonshire, tenant farmer Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), planning to buy a plowhorse at the local auction, instead blows the rent money on a handsome four-year-old bay saddler, paying 30 guineas--the approximate equivalent of nearly $3760 today.  His wife Rose (Emily Watson) is horrified and insists he take the animal back, but their teenage son Albert (Jeremy Irvine), who was present at the colt's birth and has watched it grow up, pleads to be allowed to keep and train it.  Albert names his new friend Joey, and over the months that follow he does indeed train him, even succeeding in getting him to plow a field.  But when a terrible rainstorm wipes out the family's turnip crop, their only hope of survival is to sell Joey.  A compassionate British Cavalry officer (Tom Hiddleston), sympathizing with Albert's grief, offers to lease the horse rather than buying him, but is killed in the first charge he undertakes against the Germans.  Thereafter Joey passes into German hands as an ambulance horse, then into the hands of a young French girl (Celine Buckens) who finds him after the deserters (Nicholas Bro, Leonard Carrow) who stole him hid him in her grandfather's windmill before being captured and shot, then back to the Germans to haul artillery, and at last, as the Germans frantically retreat from an Allied offensive, ends up in a tangle of barbed wire in no-man's land, where a British and a German soldier (Toby Kebbell, David Kross) call a temporary truce to free him.  At last, incredibly, he's reunited with Albert, who has joined the British Army, and lives to see Armistice Day.  But will Albert be allowed to take him home?

The real hero of the movie is, of course, Joey (I wish the credits gave the name of the horse who played him), an animal of superior training and ability who makes himself as real a character as any of the humans he meets.  Taken from a novel by Michael Morpurgo and a stage play(!) by Nick Stafford, and directed by Steven Spielberg, the movie has all the action and great effects you'd expect, but it's also a story of courage, endurance, and loyalty on the part of humans and horses alike.",1438300800,,2168,4.729442970822281

Horse is raised by a loving master, horse overcomes the odds to save the family farm, horse is sold into service, horse endures a magical journey through the pages of history. Deep down, there's clearly an emotional, colorful, ageless story just begging to be told, but not like this. Time and time again, director Steven Spielberg takes the easy route, opting to embrace the storybook-courageous, squishy human aspects of the animal itself, at the expense of his dry, boring, two-legged supporting cast. The spotlight shines for so long, so brightly upon the beast, that I half expected him to throw on a British uniform and bark out a dazzling rally cry to his fellow troops as the war draws to a close. Sentimental to a fault, tame and regurgitated and downright boring, it's a real strikeout for the normally-reliable Spielberg. Better versions of the same story have been told in half the time, with a fraction of the budget.",1434931200,,1011,4.816091954022989

Only hours before, earlier today, I watched American Pharoah win the Belmont Stakes to become the first triple crown winner in 37 years.  So my mind was on horses and I saw it sitting there on my DVD rack, still in it's original packaging.

Yes it has that ""Lassie"" or ""The Yearling"" or ""Old Yeller"" stuff going on. You know the sappy animal love thing to it.  But that did not bother me.  This is quite a good film.

I became immersed in the whole film.  To some extent the film caught the horror (and mistake) that was WW I.  As a Navy Vet, I was appalled at the trench warfare.  The scene between the Brit and the German setting the horse free from the barbed wire was Spielberg at his best.

5050308,5,B0072GPQNG,"What I really loved about 'War Horse' was the entire different angle on warfare. For once, we didn't focus on a single being or a single 'side' but yet we seen the horrors of war from both perspectives and not only from the different soldiers perspective but from the civilian perspectives. Furthermore, the movie showed a ton of different angles within the war (not stuck on a single foot soldier, air unit, etc).

I was totally skeptical about a 2 and a half hour movie that done nothing but follow a horse around the war but the insight in which it gave us to the war and numerous viewpoints while also keeping us intrigued from the perspective of an animal's role in the war, it presented its piece well, and I truly enjoyed it. Also, I LOVE horses so my heart kept going out to the poor baby and I just wanted to rescue him...

It was a beautiful film that I would without a doubt recommend to anyone interested in this historical period or just in horses in general.

The only way I'd not recommend seeing this movie is if you cannot stomach the ill treatment of animals (not a fault of the movie however; simply reality) or you just don't like long movies. As I said, I felt it did a pretty great job at holding someone's attention, all the same it was quite long and I don't know if it's a movie I could sit through numerous times at that length but it without a doubt is worth a watch.",1430524800,,1394,4.2927756653992395
5050309,3,B0072GPQNG,"The book is billed as being an anthropomorphized animal short story for children. Although distributed by Disney the movie version is too violent for young children.

What comes through most clearly is the utter futility and waste of war. And the truth of the career advice to actors about appearing in movies with animals and children. Having said that Steven Spielberg directed and produced this film speaks for the production values and the calibre of people he brings with him. For once I have not read the book which forms the basis for the piece. In the end this is the story of a boy and his horse. Many people fail both man and beast but love triumphs in the end. Despite the earnestness with which the story is presented the plot is rather simplistic and transparent.",1430524800,,776,4.664233576642336

I know Spielberg can direct a feel good movie (Close Encounters, E.T.), but this one slathers it on. There is nothing subtle or nuanced about it. It's two dimensional and totally predictable. The melodrama of the last scene, for instance, recalls Gone with the Wind. The lighting, the motions of the actors, the sappy music - I would have turned it off before the end, but I paid $2.99 to rent it, so I felt I had to endure it. I thought perhaps it was a kids movie until I saw the blood and guts on the war front. Looking at other reviews, some critics called it ""proudly sentimental and unabashedly old-fashioned.""

5050363,4,B0072GPQNG,"War Horse
 Remember when you went to the movies to see a grand spectacle, a huge story well told on a grand scale?  Did you like that sort of film?  If so you will like War Horse as much as I did.  I was apprehensive to see a PG-13 film based on a book-of the same name penned by Michael Morpurgo-aimed at young people.  With movie legend Steven Spielberg as both director and producer I should have known that I was in safe hands.
 The story is a somewhat improbable tale of a truly exceptional horse from Devon England who is taken into the British Army right at the beginning of World War I, a war so horrible and huge that it was known only as the Great War until it was replaced by one even more horrible.  Of the million British horses that went to war, fewer than 70,000 returned to their homes so he would be exceptional on that count alone.  Our horse has many frightening or touching or elevating adventures before the war ends.
 The horse, the brilliant Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and director/producer Steven Spielberg make the film.  Kaminski has filmed 35 feature productions, including Saving Private Ryan and War of the Worlds.  Spielberg gave him countryside of otherworldly beauty to film and Kaminski brings that beauty to our eager eyes.  It is grand spectacle.  Spielberg manages to present this middle school level yarn about a horse so that it touches us without ever becoming mawkish.
 The PG-13 rating is respected but the horrors of the WWI struggle are shown clearly if bloodlessly.  There are enough cuts with suffering horses, dead men and such to fully demonstrate the futile wastage of full scale war.  But Spielberg does it without the spurting gushers of blood that too often substitute for drama.  This is a big, screen filling movie.  There were some 6,800 extras hired for the film and in one single scene 260 horses are seen.  This kind of massive movie making is almost unheard of in this modern age of computer aided production.
 The human star of the film is young (21 when the filming was done) Britisher Jeremy Irvine.  Super star composer Jon Williams provided the music.
 This is a long film, over two hours.  That is a good thing only in cases like this one where we enjoy the viewing.  The budget was a tight fisted in this day and age $66 million and with domestic ticket sales of $57 million Spielberg in his producer guise should become marginally richer when all the tallies are in.  This is a solid four saw blade family friendly (over 13 please) film in the best tradition of Hollywood mega pictures.",1425772800,,2557,4.603982300884955

5050388,5,B0072GPQNG,"This is an amazing movie, it's dramatic, intense and even has a little bit of humor relief off and on. Nothing major since it's a drama but still nice. The story is about a horse called Joey who belongs to a poor family. But when the family lose their money, they are forced to sell their beloved horse to the army.

It's the war told from a war horse's POV for the very first time, and it is truly amazing and intense. Over his time in the war, Joey makes friends and enemies, rivals with a black horse, and later becomes like his brother, and eventually reunites with his old owner.

An intense, dramatic movie with a heart warming, happy ending. Worth the money! If you are a horse fan this is the movie for you.",1425081600,,715,4.25

5050396,4,B0072GPQNG,"Even judged by the usual high Spielberg standards, I thought this one of his better efforts.  This is the first film that I have seen that depicted the horrors endured by the men in the trenches during this ""War to End All Wars"" in way that made it more than a few snippets from old B&W newsreels.  Good and not-so-good behavior and motivation was displayed by both the English and German troops; unusual in that most war films take the side of the home team.  I would have given this film five stars, but for the inevitable Hollywood ending, which you had to know was coming.  I am surprised that this did not play better at the box office in in the awards arena.  A final word - most definitely NOT a film for pre-teens; too many upsetting themes for youngsters.",1424390400,2,764,4.390070921985815

5050408,3,B0072GPQNG,"Steven Spielberg has a certain type of film he makes really well, a sentimental one, and WAR HORSE is a perfect example of that for better or worse. The story follows a horse from birth, auction, and through WWI as he goes through a succession of owners. He might be the luckiest horse I've ever seen (or the unluckiest, depending on how you look at it). Through it all, he shows determination and manages to get through everything that life throws at him. Of course, this film suffers from what a lot of animal-centric films suffer from: the main character has a lack of agency in their own story. There is little reason to care about what happens to this horse beyond human compassion for animals. And since this film aims to be somewhat realistic, meaning no voices or internal monologue (like BLACK BEAUTY), you don't get a sense of what is going through its head outside of the physical performance. That leaves the character development to the human cast and, due to the nature of the story, we don't really get to spend that much time with any of them before they are jettisoned so that we can move on to the next chapter in the horse's life. There were several recognizable character actors (some distractingly so), but none of them are really given much to do. They take a backseat to the horse at the center of the story who, as I've previously mentioned, isn't too much of a character. Stuff happens to him, but that's it. The only two moments that brought genuine emotion out in me were a scene in which a horse is put down, and the scene in which Joey (the main horse) is reunited with his first owner. Everything else beyond that felt overly staged, contrived or there because of necessity to the plot. Outside of the story, though, everything else was spectacular. Reuniting with his cinematographer from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Steven Spielberg crafted some beautiful images staged some excellent battle sequences. Given the PG-13 rating, it's a bit toned down from what he did previously but nonetheless just as effective. And of course the acting was all very good, even if most of the cast were just playing filler characters. I even liked John Williams' score which complemented the film very nicely. Overall, I could take or leave the sappy nature of the story, but Steven Spielberg has made such a beautiful film that it is possible to overlook some of the other faults. It's not his greatest work, but it makes for a decent, non-challenging watch.",1423353600,3,2467,4.673563218390805

5050511,5,B0072GPQNG,"Had to read this for my History class, and I have to say.... I LOVE IT.... while it is based off a book. The movie shows how one horse had endured so very much during the war and what people put the horses through. I will say I did shed a few tears. This Horse goes from one person to the next and then is reunited .... I will just say.. YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.. while we lost many loved ones from one war to the next, this is the view point of a the horses that were ran down.. As most movies there is some inaccuracy  if you are a big history buff..  You will noticed .. but, overall, I think this film was wonderfully done.",1417219200,,627,3.890625
5050512,5,B0072GPQNG,"This is one of the few movies that makes me cry every time without fail. Without giving anything away, it's a beautiful ""boy-meets-horse"" story, and it does a great job of depicting the horror of war without it being all blood and guts. Though both Joey and Albert go through hell, I can reassure you that it does have a tolerable ending. Spielberg takes the viewer on an exhilarating journey all through the film, and the locations used are absolutely gorgeous. Though it's not combat scenes all the way through, there is a sense of the looming threat of the war even in peaceful scenes. There are several charming human characters that make the film very enjoyable, but the horses are the ones that the viewer is encouraged to become attached to. I would recommend this film to anyone with a love for animals and a soft heart (though if you're one who gets distressed to see animals in danger or suffering, I would give this one a pass). Overall a very heart-warming film with brilliant acting (especially from the four-legged cast members) and a truly fantastic piece of cinematography. Do give it a try.",1417219200,,1107,4.682051282051282

Nowhere near as bloody as ""Saving Private Ryan"", which makes it more accessible - leaving out the gore makes it more effective.  BTW:  Look for up-and-coming Benedict Cumberbatch (""Sherlock""; ""The Hobbit"") as a young British cavalry officer.

I took my 79-year-old stepdad, who is a WW-II veteran, to see it with me in the theater.  He thought it was one of the best movies he'd seen in years (and he goes frequently to movies, having retired from the Air Force some years ago).

He was very impressed with the authenticity of the farming scenes in the beginning, and commiserated with the difficulty of plowing a field with a horse-drawn plow.  He thought that plow used in the opening scene was the most impressive part of the film -- sometimes the small details a director gets right are more impressive than the fanciest special effects.",1410393600,,788,4.6

5050623,5,B0072GPQNG,I believe this to be a deeply moving piece of art. War Horse brings out my feelings and I don't let those out often!

5050624,5,B0072GPQNG,"As a person who shares life with horses I found parts of it to be a bit frustrating. But also because I share my life with horses, I found the overall movie to be very moving, which far outweighed the not quite accurate moments.  WWI was horrible for horses as old ways met new and the horse lost.  I am very glad Spielberg choose not to show literally bloody details, but I wonder if people watching have any idea what that much barbed wire would do to living flesh.  While veering quite a bit from the details of the book, the overall story stayed convincing and true to the book's depiction of love, devotion, and the horrors of war.  I do recommend watching this movie.",1406419200,,673,4.36

What happens to the horse and his only horse friend during WW I is not pleasant and I would hesitate to show the movie to a young child. When 2 men on different sides of the war go after getting the horse out of the mess he is in (in a no-mans zone and tangled in so much barbed wire he can no longer move an inch), one sees the fact that the men can be on different sides and still decide to help the horse.

I would have liked to see more heartfelt interaction between the boy and the horse, but this movie did hit all the right marks with respect to further food for thought and how you never know what the universe has planned....., I noticed many are afraid to watch this, they must think the horse dies or something?  It's a lot of drama, you may cry, or feel relief or regret, all the things Stephen king can bring out from his viewers, but certainly don't miss it.",1405296000,,622,4.4

5050699,5,B0072GPQNG,"Growing up in the 90s, maybe it was just for me, but being a history buff, I've lately felt like I needed to do my own research to learn more about WW1. All I had growing up from history books, to movies, to even video games, are just images of Europe burning, tanks on the autobahn, WW2 air planes, bombs, visions of Normandy, and Nazi parades, a mustached tyrant that when it comes to WW1 I only know that some Franz Ferdinand got shot so the world goes to war in trenches?

As I've done my own research I've been somewhat cued in and introduced into the intricacies and the world of WW1, yet we all seem to be ushered in to the world WW2 more-so.

I enjoyed War Horse because it gave a look at some other aspects of WW1 that we all don't know about... it showed us the world of that time, and one horse and kid's journey through the war. With Spielberg directing, you know it can't go wrong. It's been a few years since its release, but I was hoping hollywood would carry the mantle of re-introducing us to WW1 through film a hundred years after its occurence..",1403827200,,1064,4.236453201970443

The conviction of a young man that he could teach a horse to be harnessed and plow, the courage to pursue his conviction and the love and understanding to communicate with the horse is a real story of human ability.

5050723,3,B0072GPQNG,"First things first. This is a gorgeous movie. Looks incredible. I enjoyed it! I would advise everyone to watch it. You won't be let down.

The main character is the horse (of course). The other characters in the movie are secondary and it is mainly a set of 6 different stories (well perspectives might be a better term) interwoven by the main character's journey. It is an interesting format but just as I get pulled in to one, it switches to another.

So we have this incredible journey during an incredible event with people dealing and overcoming incredible things. Each story has plenty of things interesting about it and its all set up so that you really do connect with the characters...its just half of the time it isn't enough.

As impressive as the story is, the flaw is in the story. There just wasn't enough to pull me in and as much as I loved the main character and felt sorrow and joy for him...it just wasn't enough to push the movie past 3 stars.

3 stars is still above average and I get the feeling that whenever I get around to watching it again I very well could pick up things I missed the first time. So please, watch this movie...you will enjoy it.",1402617600,,1172,4.412037037037037

The story of Joey's life is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. To think that this poor animal went through such highs and lows and I went right along with him. He touched the lives everyone he met...good and bad people.  From the ""Charge!"" to Joey's different lives, he just carried you along with him.  The acting was wonderful. Jeremy Irvine was excellent.

5050757,2,B0072GPQNG,"This movie is way too cloying for a good historical drama, and way way too violent for a sweet/cloying drama.  The beginning minutes of the film features a boy running up a big hill to see his horse in a shot that is straight out of the Sound of Music-- circling camera and everything-- where Maria runs up the hill, twirls around, and sings ""The hills are alive...""  But imagine Sound of Music where the family, instead of escaping, is captured in the churchyard scene and the next hour and 1/2 is filmed up-close-and-personal in horrible prison camp. Right. Bad combination. Then ending in so many spoonfuls of sugar that you are sickened, complete with loveable ol' codgers, and group hugs in deep orange sunsets.
Two stars instead of one because of a brilliant, thrilling shot of hundreds of horses and riders emerging from a field of grain that comes up to the rider's waist.

5050834,3,B0072GPQNG,"Ill spare you from a lengthy description of this movies plot and just go straight to the pros and cons because there is already a pile of reviews to glean information from and the plot is pretty obvious anyway.

Without a doubt the most admirable thing about his movie is the filming. From locations all over the United Kingdom, you are treated with fantastic backdrops and scenery in almost every scene. This is very important, because when you become overwhelmed by the cheesy dialogue or the clich plot twists you can simply look past the characters and enjoy the beauty of the English countryside. As the movie progresses and we are transported to war-torn France, the scenery becomes much less beautiful but it is no less impressive. The no-mans land and trench sets in particular are quite well done.

As for the controversy on whether this is a war movie or a horse movie all I can say is that youll probably get the opposite of whichever one you're expecting. The movie begins in 1912 so the war doesnt really become a factor until 30-40 minutes in (WWI: 1914-1918). And while the story is centered on the protagonist and his horse amidst World War I, most of the scenes offer a look into what is happening behind the front lines rather than actual combat. You are given a lot more drama than violence, but you also definitely do not forget there is a war going on.

Now here comes the complaint section.

First off, everyone in this movie speaks English, despite the fact that a lot of the characters are German or French. Yes, it simplifies things, but why cast ethnic Germans to play German soldiers and then have them speak English? I mean, theres even a part in the movie where a British soldier says to a German You speak good English as if the rest of the German army hadnt been speaking English thus far in the movie. Add onto that the number of Germans with fake or British accents and you will become slightly annoyed. But this is just a minor complaint.

The biggest problem with this movie stems from the excessive emotional attachment the protagonist has with his horse. I can understand having emotional connections with animals, but this movie goes beyond that. When Albert (the protagonist) had his big farewell moment with Joey (the horse) I thought I was watching the waterfall scene from Last of the Mohicans. Honestly, he actually says the line Wherever you are, I WILL FIND YOU! Meanwhile, I am watching and cannot stop myself from saying Get a grip man, its just a damn horse!

But thats not the end, its just the beginning. As the war progresses and Joey continues his long heartbreaking journey through France, he falls into the hands of person after person, all of whom have their own sad story. Dont be deceived though, the tears are not meant to be shed for these minor characters, save them for the horse!

After these side stories progress and fulfill their purpose and we are re-introduced to the main character/main storyline, we are shocked to find that it is suddenly the autumn of 1918 and that Joey has been on his misadventure for nearly four years! Not only has Joey survived four years in the war (an incredulous feat given the mortality rate of horses in the war), Albert has not given up on him during this time! Its been four years, and he hasn't given up. He still thinks hell find his long lost horse. This is meant to explain his deep affection for his pet, but instead it seems more like neurosis. Not to mention he tears up over the horse on multiple occasions and then barely shows any emotion when his best friend dies (this is not a spoiler by the way, you should know an expendable character when you see one).

The last hour of the movie is where it really starts to get nonsensical. They give you the epic battle scene that was inevitably coming, and its actually really well done believe it or not. That is, until the British soldiers reach the enemy fortifications and all the Germans are either dead or have disappeared. Its like you can actually here them saying Crap they need another touchy emotional moment, we better retreat! Then, immediately afterward it cuts to Joey in the hands of a teamster amidst hundreds of soldiers. They stop to rest for a moment, and then again, everyone disappears! We are left only with Joey and a British tank, which proceeds to chase him around for a while for utterly no reason. The movie continues in the same way, with all of this leading up to the dreadfully obvious and clich ending.

Bottom line: This movie WILL try to beat you to death with clichs, and it WILL try way too hard to make you cry. 2.5 stars.",1396483200,,4613,4.561594202898551

5050878,3,B0072GPQNG,"I love horse-related movies, a la Secretariat, Seabiscuit, and Flicka. I'm also something of an Anglophile; therefore, I really wanted to love War Horse. What an utter disappointment it was; had it not been for the movie's stunning cinematography I would have given it fewer than three stars.

In retrospect, I think this movie tries and fails to become more epic than the intrinsically simple tale of a young man and his horse. As a result War Horse suffers from a lack of continuity that occurs when the horse miraculously turns up with new owners time and again. Moreover, while the movie wants to push a degree of realism, too many incredible incidents transpire; for instance:

1. The cavalry charge -- how is it, in the face of massed machinegun fire the horse's rider was killed, but the horse survived unscathed? And for that matter, why did the Germans have fixed machinegun emplacements trained on their own encampment?

2. The French girl finds two horses in a windmill -- well, okay, but how does a girl who's never ridden before suddenly mount the horse and tear off at a well-seated gallop?

3. Few things are more sickening than watching a horse run through barbed wire -- the barbs tear through a crazed animal's flesh, muscle and sinew; yet, the horse in this movie manages to do so, while becoming totally ensnarled, suffering only a few scratches. The military surgeon even comments the horse's main problem is a risk of tetanus.

As I said, I should have loved this movie, but I didn't. I know the horse is supposed to be a metaphor of sorts, but it has alluded me entirely.",1394841600,,1594,4.678571428571429

The torment and heroism of all the animals in this movie break your heart.

The boy's mother played by Emily Watson, Jean Reno who plays the doctor towards the end, and Tom Hiddleston who plays a soldier are the 3 best performances in the movie, but they also have short screen time compared to the silly horse and his boy.  When these 3 were not on screen I found myself just wanting the movie to finish already. I felt the movie was trying to hard to make the audience fall in love with the horse and make them cry when it really didn't have to try that hard.

5050917,5,B0072GPQNG,Absolutely underrated Spielberg film. He made a horse a real character and depicted the era so majestically. Inspiring filmmaking and typical Spielberg style.,1392681600,,158,5.913043478260869
5050918,5,B0072GPQNG,"A screenwriter once stated that he never allowed facts to get in the way of a good story.  This is obvious in ""War Horse"", however from the point-of-view in telling a deep, human-interest, tear jerking story this movie is one of the best in a long while.  The backdrop of world war I was timely only in that the cavalry had become obsolete by the machine gun and the role of the horse in war was rapidly disappearing.  If you are into history this movie is very disappointing, but if you enjoy a great human interest story then this movie is a must see.  The story of the father, the relationship between Albert and Joey the horse, the triumphs and tragedies, and the action scenes make this a powerful and suspenseful tale of human endeavor and the tragedy of war.  There are moments in which the pace of the movie is a little slow and a few spots where the pace may be a little too fast, yet the manner in which the story unfolds and the twist that occur throughout make a truly wonderful movie.",1392595200,,997,4.338709677419355

5050923,3,B0072GPQNG,This was an ok movie...  I enjoyed certain historical aspects of this wartime movie but many of the scenes involving the horse were a little hard to swallow.

5050930,3,B0072GPQNG,"At the forefront of a compelling movie are the characters and a gripping storyline, and War Horse certainly has both. At the same time, all or at least most of the crucial events need to be believable if the film is to escalate into the higher echelons. Unfortunately, War Horse juxtaposes between the starkly real and forced sentimentality. While some episodes were edge-of-your seat mesmerizing, other parts felt like the storytellers were forcing the issue. Particularly at two or three of the most vital scenes of the film, ""oh you can't be serious"" brought the movie out of its believability and into overt melodrama, such as in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Forrest Gump"". The film could have been a genuinely profound statement of survival and redemption if it hadn't lowered its standards in a few places, particularly at the end. Instead, it tries to make the audience merely feel good, which is at odds with so much of the rest of film.

The main thrust is the tried-and-true formula of two kindred spirits attempting to be re-united; in this case a boy and his beloved horse. A family only a couple of generations removed from a medieval-like existence in Northern England are on the brink of starvation and eviction when the drunkard father bids for a horse. Only the amount is about 3 to 4 times the horse's worth. And worse yet, he outbid his own landlord who is owed several months back rent. This beginning worked fine for me as it sets up the ideas of bad judgment and desperation. Somehow they have to make their animal bring a return on their investment by using it to plow their barren fields, or they'll be out in the snowy streets. How this unfolds works, more and less, until mother-nature destroys their plans. In the meantime, the boy Albert bonds with the horse as only young adults and horses can, as we have seen in other stories like ""the Black Stallion"" and ""National Velvet"". The bonding was a bit forced and at one point I knew immediately one element of their relationship would be recapitulated later. But even given that I was willing to run with it. However, one problem with clich&eacute; is ultimately it's boring.

Next, the boy wakes up one morning to find the stable empty. He races to town where his horse has been sold to a regiment in the British Army about to embark in the conflict known then as the Great War, now called World War I. The horse has been sold for near its asking price to a young colonel. At this point, I felt the film had disrobed its cloak of sentimentality and the real story begins. The horse also befriends another black stallion owned by another young officer, and the two become almost like the animal-equivalent of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn engaging in unimaginable adventures.

What makes War Horse interesting from this point forward, and ultimately saves it as a film, is that we follow the horse and his friend as the main characters of the story. We experience the war literally through the horses' eyes as it travels to the European Continent, fights in battles, changes hands, finding enemies and friends on both sides. The horses even find an alley or two among the Germans. At one point, we know a bond has developed between the two horses. Several times, the horses are employed to assist in the transportation of decidedly 20th-century technology; the old technology helping out the new. Another quite compelling moment involves the main horse trapped in the middle of so-called No-Mand's Land between the English and German trenches. These episodes were so un-clich&eacute; that I was riveted at every moment.

However, about 3/4's through the story, the young Albert re-appears, now as a low-rank soldier in the conflict. And here, for me, it began to go downhill. Of course, we as the audience desire the horse and the boy to be re-united. But how this plays out seemed just too convenient to be believable. At one moment when it appears all is lost, the story took an obvious favorable turn and I didn't buy it. I found myself shaking my head and saying ""oh brother"". I wished I could have grabbed the script and given the work a better ending. Unfortunately, the ending rang more of a clich&eacute; you might find in a Harlequinn Romance than a compelling story about a horse during World War I.

Still, there are many good things in War Horse, and much to praise, but it also made the entire experience feel like the film didn't know which way it wanted to travel, a sentimental ""feel good"" paved street or the much more profound dirt road of thwarted desires because of human conflict. Which makes its obvious weakness all the more frustrating. When Claude Rains says ""Round up the usual suspects"" in ""Casablanca"" or the boy in ""Empire of the Sun"" is finally re-united with his parents, you never once think it was contrived, that the writers forced the story into a particular direction. It all feels natural. The ending of War Horse was disappointing because so many other aspects lacked the cooked-up feel of the end. For this reason endings are not always easy, and finding the ending which is both satisfying and natural makes the difference between a good film and a great one. This one could have been great but ranks as only merely good. Darn.",1392076800,,5237,4.7066521264994545
5050931,4,B0072GPQNG,I love horse movies and have been wanting to see this movie ever since it came. So glad Amazon Prime had it available to rent. Netflix and Redbox did not have it.,1391990400,,162,4.09375
5050932,5,B0072GPQNG,It told the story  the real story. Of life as  war horse and the unglamorous life they lead in the  civil war and the crult an uncivil like way they were treated.,1391990400,,162,4.0
5050933,5,B0072GPQNG,Saw this movie when it came out and loved it. Ordered it from you in early January and it was charged to my account shortly thereafter. DVD arrived in broken plastic case and I have been negotiating its return right up through today. Seller has made promises for return labels and such but has not performed. Bottom line: I am out money for over three weeks and still do not have a playable DVD. How would you feel?,1391990400,,415,4.333333333333333
5050934,3,B0072GPQNG,"I'm not sure why I expected this movie to be one of those standard ""something/someone is lost, goes on a journey/hardships, returns/things work out in the end"" type movies but I did. And this was *not* that type of movie. I won't spoil anything for you, but the depiction of war was not brushed over in any way - it was all pretty realistic. Which is fine, but I just wanted to let that be known. Also, I read a review which said ""War Horse"" wasn't much of a horse movie, and that if someone was a horse-lover to be aware of it. As someone who does not particularly care about horses one way or the other, I thought it was completely a horse movie. The horse is pretty much the only character that the script writer cared about.

I understand that I probably misunderstood the general premise of this movie and many people probably do not expect the type of movie I did. But I am writing this review for those people who don't know much about the movie. Overall it was a good movie and had solid performances from a variety of actors (including Tom Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch), but if you are looking for a casual-movie-with-a-happy-ending this is not it.",1391990400,,1164,4.464788732394366

5050936,1,B0072GPQNG,"I absolutely detested this movie and can not imagine anyone who cares about horses (or dogs for that matter as they are too often sent to war) being able to enjoy this on any level. I realize it was written about a time when people were more naive and gullible - but to me, that makes the twists and turns of this story even more horrifying -- and the positive reviews more bizarre. I would never consider suggesting anyone allow a child to see this as it is full of ugly bloody scenes as well as emotionally wrenching ones. I cannot recall ever feeling this level of dismay and disgust about a movie, no matter how much of a clunker it was or poorly made or badly acted. Those were not my issues with this movie though. I felt like I was watching a very ugly period of time being romanticized in hindsight. Many of the reviews on here simply validate that point. People who use words like nobility and who talk of metaphors are missing the point of how abused these animals truly were.",1391990400,3,986,4.335135135135135

For anyone who doesn't believe animals have feelings too, this movie portrays it well.  I know, because I've owned horses most of my life and have witnessed such affection.

5050986,4,B0072GPQNG,"I am from the ole school I guess...If I want a ""message"", I'll  request  one on e-mail, a letter, or read a book . My favorite  movie entertainment is a film  with wonderful scenes(camera work),action(not wild  blasts and un-needed noises), acting that makes me forget  they are acting, music of any kind that I may be humming days after, and a plot(story line ) that  perhaps makes me wish I had been there at that time, but maybe not in all the scenes in this one. Now, anything Spielberg does is propbably pretty  top stuff with all of these  ingedients.  That's WAR HORSE..!!  I am not a horse lover. Although I love those western movies..especially  those Republic and Columbia series cowboy westerns of  30's-40's. I like cats and dogs. Howeever, this movie  may  move me to visit my farmer friend  who has riding horses that I have ignored. Surprise... WAR HORSE  gives us many beliveable leading characters. Surprise !

5051014,5,B0072GPQNG,"...Yes some may complain about the ""formulaic"" plot/ script BUT by no means should that deter you.  It is a good, solid movie.  I love horses and to that degree there are some harsh scenes and to a greater extent, harsher scenes involving the soldiers (all of them,) as well.  (I am a Veteran by the way.)

That said, it is for the most part a bloodless movie in spite of the fact that the war imagery is quite savage and yet tastefully done. Still you might have to cover the young ones' eyes if you determine the violence is a bit much.

Although the horse is the star, he is also the primary plot device, much like R2D2 and C3PO were for the Star Wars franchise.  It is almost like an ensemble cast movie with the ""horse"" connecting the lives.

A good, good, afternoon movie to watch!!!",1386979200,,789,4.29054054054054

5051018,4,B0072GPQNG,"This was a beautifully done movie. I could never watch it more than the one time that I did though because it's also one of the absolute most depressing movies I have seen.

5051028,4,B0072GPQNG,"This sentimental (though just short of mawkish) movie, directed by Steven Spielberg, is about a horse from a farm in the English countryside which is sent to the frontlines in France at the beginning of World War I. Much more things happen, and its young owner, Albert (Jeremy Irvine), itself a soldier in the conflict, will try to get reunited to his beloved horse. Well made, entertaining. Perhaps the films best scene has the British troops charging over the Germans in a forest. The photography showing the pretty countryside of England and France helps a lot. Emily Watson and Peter Mullan appear as the parents of Albert. Other known actors also appear in the film, including Benedict Cumberlatch and Niels Arestrup as a French farmer who takes care of the horse.",1385251200,,769,4.877862595419847

5051030,5,B0072GPQNG,"War Horse, in my opinion, is an incredible movie.  Granted, this movie is difficult to watch for those of us who have more empathy for animals than most humans, but the scenery, the acting, the storyline are superb!  Jeremy Irvine was spectacular in his breakout role, Tom Hiddleston was beyond incredible, and the rest of the main cast were great as well.  Keep the tissues handy, this movie will make you cry.",1384819200,,411,4.680555555555555
5051031,5,B0072GPQNG,Great movie.....don't want to mess up the ending for those who haven't seen it.  If you love horses and what animals can do to people's hearts?  You'll love this movie.,1384819200,,168,4.566666666666666

5051033,3,B0072GPQNG,"Great idea for a film!! It's just kind of boring. I don't know why. THe music is outstanding, and the performance were great, too. I think there needed to be more of a plot insofar the horse is concerned. He was just floating through the war, and I didn't know what I was rooting for rather than survival of the horse. I needed more of a reason to care that he return to the boy. Maybe if the boy was blind? Something.",1384732800,,418,4.109756097560975

I'm glad I rented it, but I don't know that it will make its way into my list of DVD must-haves. Also a warning to any ""softies"" or even kind-of softies - it may have cute horsies, but remember that this is a war movie. It may not be Saving Private Ryan, but it definitely gets pretty heavy, and has its fair share of brutal and tragic moments. Not a negative point to me, it's WAR after all, but just saying, be prepared for it. keep the tissues handy.",1384646400,,620,4.048780487804878

Many were slaughtered because the British could not bring them back to England. In the book, the story is the view of the horse, but that could not be carried into the film.

5051050,5,B0072GPQNG,"I have had so many people in my life, simply not understanding my love for animals. The intensity i feel when i know about an animal being abused or suffering. When i was in high school i saw on the news a dog being abused, soon after i found a dog in the street about to be hit by a car eventually the owner took the dog back but he said that he would let his dog walk around on its own in the street. When i graduated high school i adopted a dog from a shelter. She has been apart of me since that day like a soulmate. This movie made me cry not just because i have the same relationship with my dog as Albert in the movie has with joey. Its because i been waiting so long to see a movie that tells the point of view of what an animal can go through. Animals have no voice its our job to speak for them defend them and love them. Many of you may laugh at me or think nothing of what i say, but when you watch this movie you will learn. You will feel a compassion for that in which you may have forgotten. If you can tell someone to watch this movie they might learn a new found respect for animals they didn't before. The story line was all i could have ever wished for, but even for those of you who are not interested in animals or war i urge you to watch this the acting the method it was filmed in absolutely perfection. The movie does not drag nor does it rush it gives you a little bit of every part of the human condition.

5051068,5,B0072GPQNG,"With all due respect to Spielberg, the story of War Horse existed long before the movie.  The film is an adaptation of a children's story written by Michael Morpurgo over 30 years ago.  It was inspired by the depictions and anecdotes from those who experienced the Great War, including a painting of horses charging through barbed wire.

Real events:  The backdrop of the story depicts the real conditions of warfare.  Millions of horses were slaughtered on both sides of the conflict.  At the dawn of the 20th century, it was the first clash between the old battle tactics with charging cavalry and the new mechanized world of tanks, machine guns and artillery.  Much of the war was a 4-year long stalemate with soldiers a few hundred yards from each other in filthy trenches, separated by barricades of barbed wire and pelting poisonous gas at each other.  I wonder how many people know that the term ""No Man's Land"" originated then, or why Nov 11th is a holiday.

Story:  The book tells the story of war and cruelty vs love and humanity through the eyes of the horse.  As a children's book, the message is direct and inspiring.  It doesn't explore the trivial politics that started the war and the  meaninglessness of the devastating waste of life that followed.  It speaks to the ageless human need to connect and to find hope in the midst of hopelessness.  That's why dogs are universally therapeutic in children's hospitals, prisons and old-age homes.  The story is captivating on it's own.  I first saw it in its Broadway play adaptation.  The Handspring Puppets stopped being contraptions of steel and wood manipulated by visible humans and quickly became as real and engaging as any true-life horse.  I wanted to see the story again, which brings me to the movie.

Movie:  The story is worth 5 stars and at least 4 hankies on its own.  The rating above is for this adaptation of the story.  It is a worthy telling of the story of War Horse.

1). Cinematography:  Very good, the filming was done on location in Britain and adds immeasurably to the scenes.  There are a number of wide panoramic shots of the beautiful countryside.  The war scenes are grimly realistic from the mud and rats in the trenches to the mounds of spent and mutilated horses.  The scenes of Joey galloping panic-stricken through the battlefield to be thoroughly entangled in barbed wire was heart-wrenching.  In fact it was so real, I wondered how they did it under the watch of SPCA advocates.

2). Horses:  Excellent:  They picked a pair of beautiful horses to be Joey and Topthorn.  You can definitely see the cause for heartache of the German wrangler to be ordered to turn them into draft horses.  The scene of the horses pulling the heavy artillery gun to the top of the ridge was worth a hankie by itself.  Often times you can see the cues and staging of animal actors.  The training and handling of these horses told the story seamlessly.

3). Casting:  Good:  Actors probably want to stand out for their performances.  For me, I think a performance is best when the actor becomes the character and doesn't stand out.  I like how Jeremy Irvine was able to subtly show the boy at the beginning and the growth to manhood by the end.  I especially liked Peter Mullan as his father.  It was a much better depiction than in the play, although in the play the father stayed home from the Boer War.  It helps to have the mother explain about Albert's father's past in the war and adding the regimental pennant as a thread through the storyline.  But I thought Mullan gave depth to the character and to the family's plight.  Otherwise the father is just a mean old drunk that sells the boy's horse without telling him.

This movie is a great depiction of an excellent story that is worth seeing, and seeing many times.  My only warning is to stock up on hankies.",1381017600,,3844,4.6335311572700295

5051097,5,B0072GPQNG,"Mark Twain's observation is a fitting title for a review of this rousing screen production with which Stephen Spielberg has gifted us.
  Based on a stage play of the same name, it follows the World War I adventures of a brown mare named Joey, born and raised on a farm in Devon, England by farm boy Albert Narracott( Jeremy Irvine), who lives on a family farm with his father(Peter Mullan)and mother(Emily Watson).
 They endure a challenging relationship with their land owner,David Lyons(David Thewlis in his first film since the close of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise), but young Albert impresses Mr. Lyons and the other landowners  with his ability to use Joey to plow a challenging plot of land. But soon the financially strapped Mr. Narracott sells  Joey to Captain Nicols(Tom Hiddleston), despite the pleas of a devastated Albert as World War I begins and many horses from local farms are recruited for the fight. The now-tattered banner carried by Mr. Narracott in a previous war, will be the distinguishing artifact identifying Joey as his perilous adventure begins.
 The throughbread is attracted to a beautiful black mare  who will share many of his wartime escapades by the name of Topthorn.
 The two have an exhilarating race against each other as part of their and their officer's basic training.
  Soon they are in France facing combat against the Germans, and Joey rushes through the forest sans his rider under heavy artillery fire only to end up in German custody with Topthorn.
  The dual equine adventure continues as two brothers in the Kaiser's Army(David Kross and Leonard Carrow) use them in an ill-fated attempt to desert.
  Left in a windmill by the brothers, they are found by a sickly French orphan named Emilie(Celine Buckens)who lives on the farm where the windmill is situated with her grandfather(Niels Arestrup).
  Tending to the horses brightens the young girl's life. But while she was initially able to save them from confiscation when the German Army raided their farm and home for food, to her great devastation, Emilie fails to shield them from another attempted confiscation. The Hippie Era  slogan, ""War is unhealthy for children, and other living things"" receives more than enough visual emphasis in this scene.
  With their furlough from battle all too abruptly ended, they are made to pull heavy German artillery, and the conflict becomes more brutal.
  Joey will grieve a loss and gallop around, over, and through the trenches to get past the human madness of artillery fire in a scene that makes one have further regrets how Man's shameful inability to solve disputes peacefully has such terrifying impact on all living creatures. War is the ultimate stupid human trick!
  But there is a brief moment of unity when two officers from opposite sides of the conflict help free Joey from entanglement in barbed wire.
  By this time, Albert has joined the conflict and despite the odds of finding him, is looking for Joey with a moving sense of dogged determination.
  A post Harry-Potter era Matthew Lewis appears as a soldier in the trenches, and Liam Cunning plays an Army doctor presiding over a fateful decision involving Joey.
  Viewers can learn the ultimate fate of the two-legged and four-legged combatants against a beautiful golden twilight.-A serene and solemnly triumphant ending!",1376092800,2,3332,5.040219378427788

5051103,4,B0072GPQNG,"A great film, no doubt, I was a little disappointed with it though. However, the ending is worth the wait. As a movie and a story it finishes very strongly.

The scene where the German soldier and the Allied soldier try to free the horse from barb wire was reminiscent of the true life tale of WW I where almost all sides of the conflict put down their arms momentarily on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day of 1914 to exchange food, gifts, play football and participate in joint burials of their comrades recovered from no-man's-land during the two day truce. In that spirit, the movie faithfully depicts the story of WW I and all the modern horrors it introduced to the battlefield, machine guns, mustard gas and tanks and it tracks the descent of both the people and the horses from the honorable positions of cavalry-men and war horses to just cogs in a new, giant and cruel mechanized machine bent on crushing everything in its path.",1375228800,,935,4.598802395209581

5051132,3,B0072GPQNG,"I guess there was so much initial hype on this movie I expected much much more.  It was too long and for me ... boring much of the movie.  Does not match up to movies like Secretariat, Sea Biscuit, or Black Beauty or National Velvet.",1370736000,,233,4.155555555555556

5051134,5,B0072GPQNG,"I use the words ""family film"" with reservation because it is full of violence. But it does remind me of some of the old Disney animal movies, like Old Yeller, etc. It's inspirational and memorable because of the various relationships people have with the horse. But then there is the violence of World War I, which was a very inhumane war. That inhumanity becomes disturbingly real when this magnificent breed is used to haul cannon - a job that soon kills most horses - and later when he gets entangled in barbed wire. His journey through WWI is incredible; but his original owner, a young farm-boy-turned-soldier, never gives up on reuniting with him. This is an edge-of-your-seat suspense film, action film, and heart-warming tear-jerker that you won't forget.

Great acting, great production values, and the horses used are absolutely amazing.",1370563200,,847,5.05

5051139,4,B0072GPQNG,"The role of the horse as a servant to mankind and in war over the ages provides an insight into the devotional relationship between man and beast of burden. The fact that no matter what side of political struggles in this particular war people were advocating, thd presentation of their relationship to the horse was foremost. The scenes ranged from horrid to very touching. Even the ole drunk was devoted to the horse, as were the enemies who help free him from the barbed wire snare. The realities portrayed should be in front of anyone who thinks of the horse of mainly something outdated or only to bet upon in a current race. Beautiful cinematography. The movement of the horse gets inside you and propels how important this social animal has been to help its human caregiver.",1369785600,,781,4.708029197080292

5051141,5,B0072GPQNG,The realism and intensity of the battle scenes were a bit too much at times.  The human kindnesses shown to the horse during its life encounters are touching while the brutality heaped upon it by others is beyond repugnant. Yet the horse's spirit is never broken and its mission to find home and his master stays firm until fate brings all into reality.,1369526400,,353,4.603174603174603
5051142,5,B0072GPQNG,"I can't believe I waited almost a year to see this. I was unexpectedly surprised and very satisfied with Spielberg's latest film (his best since Catch Me If You Can a decade ago), based on the critically-acclaimed play of the same name.

It has a charming enough beginning and premise: a young man takes in an injured horse and trains him to plow, hoping to raise enough money to save his family's farm. As World War I breaks out, however, the family is forced to sell the horse and the movie truly begins.

While I expected a standard narrative, the film functioned in a much more interesting way: the horse passed between different parties, British and German soldiers, a young French girl, and others throughout the course of the war. I won't give any spoilers but the ending is incredibly moving and satisfying.

The movie seems to drag on during the second hour (clocks in at almost 150 minutes), but the payoff is well worth it. The wide variety of characters are able to come together in a believable scenario, illustrating how much the horse and the war has changed all of them.

It is in this last ten minutes or so that the film truly blew me away; the characters gave incredibly stirring speeches, evoking themes of sacrifice, loss, and redemption.

In addition to the wonderful emotional power of this film, it is also very well shot and produced. The stunning imagery is often reminiscent of Gone With the Wind, of characters in desperate situations silhouetted against a fiery orange sky. Their identities aren't what matters; it is the extraordinary circumstances they face and how they meet those circumstances that make this a genuinely heartfelt and inspirational work.",1369440000,,1687,4.823529411764706

5051146,5,B0072GPQNG,"Spielberg works his magic again with stunning cinematography and adapting a great story into film. The story is brilliant in using a horseand its various owners through whose hands it passesto guide your eyes through various viewpoints in WWI, from English, to French occupied to advancing German forces. It isn't a movie just about a horse; to view it at such would be a superficial viewing of the movie; it's really about people and relationships, and their connection to a horse that helps us view humanity during a conflicted time in European history. Actor Jeremy Irvine is brilliant as Albert Narracott, the boy who raises and trains the horse ""Joey."" For his first film, Irvine brings an incredible amount of heart and emotion to the film, and you'd think he'd been acting for decades already.",1369353600,,800,4.933333333333334

5051169,5,B0072GPQNG,This movie has it all!  It is historically correct depicting trench warfare and the use of gas.  It really teaches the audience more about World War I. The stunts are amazing especially the one where the horse jumps over the tank and the part where the horse becomes entangled in barb wire.  But most important it is the heart warming story of Joey the gorgeous horse.  Joey is portrayed by a truely gifted animal.  He owns the screen.  When I first watched War Horse I expect a tear jerker but is surprisingly up beat.,1367539200,,519,4.468085106382978

It's definitely a tear jerker for those who love horses or animals put into the situation of having to survive wars that ""man"" has put them into.

I think for me the movie was just too depressing. I know that The Great War isn't a cuddly feel good theme, but the dark war stuff just dragged on. There was no uplifting triumph of the human (or horse) spirit at the end. Instead I was exhausted and glad that this horse s nightmare was finally over.

The ending is a happy one but because of the brutal war scenes and shots where the horse is being traumatized I would not recommend this film for children. I was actually put off by the many war scenes and of course war itself is disgusting. But I am a sucker for animals and I read ahead of time that the horse does not die so I went ahead and watched this. The acting was okay but you do to really get a sense of connection to any of the characters because they are in the horse's life so briefly.,1364860800,,596,4.059322033898305

I loved the book and am a big fan of Steven Spielberg. But he lost his touch in this one. The movie is two and a half hours long. After the first hour we had seen only an extended corny ""a boy and his horse"" routine...all scored with the overly dramatic bombastic music under every scene. I fell asleep soon after and awoke at the 90- minute mark to hear the same treacly music and nothing much happening still. We turned it off,  I did the dishes,  and my husband caught up on a DVR'd program he had wanted to watch.

5051218,2,B0072GPQNG,"Pros: Steven Spielberg. War movie.

Cons: I don't mean the above in some sort of, ""That's all that needs to be said"" mentality. That's actually all that can be said. Only the above is still misleading. When I say ""Steven Spielberg,"" I mean that someone traveled back to the 1950's to find a Spielberg still in grade school who does not yet know how to identify good plots or scripts or make them into good movies, and then had him make this movie. And when I say ""war movie,"" I mean that if any war was in this movie, I guess that part ended up on the cutting room floor. When it finished, my roommate Jeff asked, ""Did I just watch a PG war movie?"" No, Jeff. Somehow, against all odds, this movie stumbled its way into a PG-13 rating. My guess is that the more severe rating was the result of, ""Contains no rainbows or lollipops. Allusions to violence and less happy places.""

I'm sorry, but I need to take a moment here. The fact that Spielberg directed this movie is really hurting my heart. Since the 80's, if he wasn't making movies that will literally change your life upon watching (e.g. Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List), he was at least making movies that were endlessly fun to watch (e.g. Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park). Seriously, look at his directing filmography. Seven of my forty favorite movies had Spielberg at the helm. And the rest (that I've seen) are at least highly rated, if not top rated. So why the hell did he make this movie? It's killing me. No matter how many times I check the IMDB page, his name is still right there, under ""director.""

The horse is the character that you care about the most, which I guess is the point. The problem is that the previous statement really isn't saying much, and I actually worded it wrong. What I meant to say was, ""The horse is the only character that you care about at all."" The whole movie attempts to be one big stab at sentimentality, but it falls flat on its face, because sentiment is best saved for, you know, things that you care about.

I'm pretty sure the only reason this movie got any positive press (and... *sigh*... an Oscar nomination) is because it's about a horse, which apparently gives it some sort of credibility. If you were to take the exact same plot, characters, script, and actors, but replace the horse with another, less traditionally revered animal, it almost certainly would be laughed out of every movie house in existence.

Separated by war. Tested by battle. Bound by friendship... War Goat.

Overall: The best that I can say for it is that I never really looked at the clock. But I'm pretty sure at this point that the main reason I never looked was because I was waiting with baited breath for this to turn into a Spielberg movie (i.e. a movie that I enjoy watching). Right up to the moment when the screen turned black for the closing credits, I was convinced that Spielberg was just toying with me, and that the good part of the movie was right around the corner. Then the closing credits came, followed by all those copyright things at the very end for things like Dolby sound and Technicolor, and then the screen went black, and then... Steven Spielberg forced me to disgrace him with a 4 out of 10. I actually think a movie about a goat would have at least been funny at parts.",1362873600,3,3284,4.474123539232053

5051231,5,B0072GPQNG,"Other reviewers have said just about everything there is to say about the plot, pacing, structure, cinematography, and score of the film--all excellent in my opinion--so I'll just touch on things that stood out to me.

The acting was topnotch. There was a lot of real, raw emotion that I didn't think was melodramatic--this was the first World War, after all. Many emotions were left understated, and these were just as powerful. Empathizing was easy, with both the main characters and the 'vignette' characters. There were parts that made me laugh and parts that made me cry. This movie is a real winner when it comes to capturing the true emotion in a scene.

One thing I really appreciated was the dialogue, and this really strengthened the characters. It was tight, it was realistic, and it was cleverly used to convey certain points. There were several quotes that had ties and inversions later in the movie. A few lines to watch for:
""He's not a dog.""
""We have the pluck but they have the luck.""
""Think how brave he is for refusing to be proud."" Which leads into my next point...

The theme, I thought, was bravery--a certain kind of bravery. In the beginning, Albert's mother talks to him about his father having a special kind of bravery. The Major tells his men to ""Be brave!"" in the ambush and Captain Nicholls heeds his words. The French grandfather says that there may be ""different ways to be brave."" Albie's friend Andrew shows a peculiar inversion of bravery in the trenches. And Albert himself is brave in the events following the war and his offer to let go. This theme of bravery repeats throughout, and it is reflected in the horse's journey and actions. I believe Joey is a metaphor for a certain kind of bravery: the selfless bravery that takes the fall and endures.

I believe this movie has something for everyone, thought that's for you to determine. Recommended for fans of war movies or family films. Not recommended for horse lovers, unless you're brave enough to endure an emotional journey.",1362268800,,2019,4.743589743589744

5051274,5,B0072GPQNG,"This is the story of a magnificent, amazing and miraculous horse. It is also a historical drama portraying some of the most horrifying aspects of The Great War (WW I) as seen through the horse's eyes. It is adapted from a childrens' novel written by the excellent author of childrens' literature, Michael Morpurgo. To those who believe the plot is too simplistic, sappy or childish and the animals too anthropomorphic, well HELLO...remember the original target audience. That does not mean this movie is for children only...in fact, since it depicts some rather gruesome aspects of war, judgement should be used in taking children to see it. Except for the very young, it should appeal to all age groups. As with most Spielberg films the cinematography is outstanding...especially the scenery shot in Devon which is absolutely breathtaking. The John Williams soundtrack too, perfectly sets the mood for the story. The casting, both human and animal, is spot-on. Jeremy Irvine, in his film debut, was an excellent selection to play Albert Naricott, the original owner and trainer of Joey, a beautiful chestnut stallion. You will marvel, I know I did, that horse cavalry was still used, at least in the early stages of WW I...against German machine guns.",1359331200,,1252,5.08252427184466

Watched this movie last evening and while a beautifully filmed and well-acted film, I was left unmoved. I didn't become attached to any character, indeed I felt emotionless towards all, including the horse. This morning I decided to put pen to paper when I had this epiphany that Warhorse reminded me of two other films&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lassie-Come-Home/dp/B000294U5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lassie Come Home</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Butterfly-Effect/dp/B001Q2ZHZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Butterfly Effect</a>. Creepy, but think about it. The story arc is a boy and his horse (read: dog) and how the horse is finally returned to its master and home and how people's lives are affected by others' everyday decisions. I love this comparison and I haven't read any reviews that have made a similar statement. Funny, but I really enjoy both of those films.

Regarding animal cruelty; I would say that there are a few scenes that might make the squeamish squirm slightly (my attempt at alliteration...). My wife is a horse-lover and the scenes of cruelty to the innocent horses because of war didn't bother her too much. Spielberg's portrayal of war is tame compared to the ultra-violent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B008CBZX7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>. Naturally where Spielberg shines is his beautiful cinematography and music. It used to be that Spielberg could wrap you up in his stories, but as of late, not so much. I wish that Spielberg had expounded upon the young-french girl, who fell in love with the horse and took her first horseback ride, despite her health affliction. That parting scene between her grandfather and Albert was trite and seemed forced. Weak.

The auction scene and the character of Ted, Albert's alcoholic father was well done and boded promise for the rest of the film. Sadly, the film falls flat and never rebounds. The final scene is a typical Spielberg tug at your heart-strings. But if you are going to tug at my heart-strings, at least give me characters that I care about.

This is certainly not a bad movie, indeed it's an ok movie. Just not a great movie. This was a film that I probably will not view again.

5051289,2,B0072GPQNG,"I saw this in the theater, Christmas 2011.  The landscapes and scenes are beautifully filmed.  Your eyes never get tired following the camera.  The story-line is adept at intertwining the lives of the main (human) character and the horse.  But ultimately Spielberg has nothing to say about life, or even about the cauldron of war, into which the characters are drawn.  I have noticed this lately - Spielberg cannot characterize life in any of his recent movies - he sits back away from the action and renders no judgments, offers no points of wisdom.  A real bust, considering he is considered our greatest director.  There is one point in the movie that offered an opportunity.  The father of the main character takes out an old battle pennant under which he fought in years gone by and offers the following advice to his son (I misquote): ""Son, let me tell you about war.  War is bad.""
Really????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's all that Spielberg has to say about war??  How incredibly shallow can any one man be?  I really wonder if this is simply part of his liberal ideology - the inability to think critically about topics without ideology jumping in with inane comments such as ""war is bad"".

I think the bond between man and animal is often taken for granted these days. Just like parents bear children or people have friends, animals essentially serve the same role. They require our nurturing and care, cost us money, keep us company, and expose us to any number of emotions when they do something good or bad and especially when we gain or lose them in life. But when you break it down, the strength of that bond and the longtime results of that sustained relationship are what make the journey and experiences worthwhile. And then you have war. For whatever disagreement that couldn't be solved with diplomacy, people start fighting, things get ugly, and lots of people usually get hurt or die in the process. War Horse is the story about a young lad named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) whose father one day inherits the ownership of an equally young horse, which they'd name Joey. In raising Joey to work on their farm, Albert develops a very strong bond with the trusted stallion, until WWI and other financial circumstances force his father to sell Joey for the war. With Albert swearing to enlist and someday find his loyal steed, Joey, in the meantime would embark on a very tumultuous journey with nothing but friendship and the kindness of various strangers to keep him steady along the way.

I think it's safe to say that war (in the broadest sense of nation vs. nation) has garnered a pretty negative connotation for itself. It causes pain and suffering to soldiers and non-soldiers alike, has a tendency for creating collateral damage, and a lot of things/people get lost in the chaos. Some could argue that war is a necessary evil, but it doesn't change the fact that the sheer amount of loss can be a painful thing to endure. What I find remarkable about this particular movie, though, is that Spielberg manages to show, not only the atrocities of war, but the spiritual strength of bonding. Whether it be Albert and Joey or the various other couplings we see throughout the film, I commend him for an outstanding effort in illustrating that before, and even throughout the events of war, that the power of friendship and comradery can prevail. Some reviews will argue that this film doesn't have a main character, but it does, and it's a very interesting one at that: Joey (yes, the horse). The multiple subplots between all the couplings (both man and animal) and the overall gamut of emotions that amount from all these experiences are vital in understanding just how valuable a bond can be, with the war illustrating the obvious flip-side. But even amidst the fighting, pay special attention to the meeting between an English and German soldier towards the end, as I feel that was the most pivotal point in proving the importance of bond and friendship to our humanity. The film is a true emotional roller coaster that, really, only could've better had the war scenes been more graphic. Nonetheless, it's a wonderful story.

Director Steven Spielberg and DP (director of photography) Janusz Kaminski return for, yet another, collaboration. The last, and most recent, movies of theirs that I'd seen on BD were Minority Report and War of the Worlds. Suffice it to say, various people that aren't professional reviewers or aren't as well-versed in cinematography weren't happy with the bleach bypass technique used to give both films that trademark ""silvery shimmer."" With that being the case, viewers will be happy to know that the photography for War Horse is much simpler and less futuristically-stylized. The palette in this period piece is very down-to-earth with a lot of natural browns, burgundies, and other Fall colors giving it that dated, yet warm feeling. When the war hits, the look becomes considerably murkier with lots of low lighting, various blacks and grays, and yes, even one or two instances of bleach bypass. In terms of framing, though, I have to say that with the horse playing such a vital role in the story, it equates to a lot of very wide shots to accommodate him and the surrounding people, which in turn, only goes to accentuate the grandness of the atmosphere and the period itself even more (as witnessed in the big war scenes towards the end).

In terms of the actual transfer, the movie was shot on 35mm then digitally processed at 4K resolution, which really shows in the video quality. The beginning of the film (on the farm before the war) has some amazing clarity in terms of coloring, blacks, and just the right amount of contrast that really help the audience build some empathy between Albert and Joey. The setting of the farm felt spacious enough as it was from just the camera angles alone, but the look of it (in terms of lighting, coloring, etc.) really did something for me. I've never been on a farm, personally, but through my various viewings and imaginations of it, the closeness of the people and animals on such a wide-open range is something I've always been fond of, and this particular presentation did a great job conveying that. Alternatively, when the tone of the movie changes to wartime, black levels take much more precedence giving the film a darker look, but showing razor-sharp details in the soldiers' uniforms, the dirt and mud of the earth, and the battered bodies of the men and animals in exchange. There's a little bit of intentional softness during these shots, but it's not enough for me to deny the greatness in the rest of the presentation.

Being a relatively high-budget film, not to mention a war movie, the sound mixing should come as no surprise to people expecting a great audio presentation. First and foremost, I have to commend the sound crew for the film's subtlety. The first half of the film is pretty much a kind of family drama with lots of low-volume effects, town and farmland ambiance, and some wonderful pieces of music by the legendary John Williams. It works to the effect of helping build that bond between Albert and Joey showing their innocence, growth, and eventual departure from one another. Likewise, the second half of the film becomes expectedly more aggressive through the madness of war with soldiers scurrying around, weapons being fired, and explosions popping up all over the place. Much like the first half in its successful attempt at creating a lighter mood, the second half achieves the polar opposite effect in creating a much darker one. I think a 5.1 mix would've sufficed enough, but War Horse was nominated for both Sound Mixing and Editing, with this 7.1 track being the proof in the pudding as to why.

Dialogue is clear and mostly discernible (if you're not that great at understanding European accents, anyway) from the center channel and has the perfect level of volume to keep you in the story. It's never too loud or soft enough to be drowned out by everything else and is actually a welcome change to one of the BDs I recently watched that had this problem (that BD being Enemy of the State, where the surrounds are WAY louder than the dialogue can match in terms of volume). The front left and right speakers do a majority of the work, but the sides do an excellent job complimenting noises off-screen such as chatter, clutter, weapons firing, etc. with great directionality and separation. I was thoroughly impressed by rear speaker activity, though, as they put a lot of emphasis into the effects and music making the mix a very enveloping experience. Then, of course, there's the bass. LFEs (low frequency effects) are what I'm actually referring to when I say the sound mix has ""subtlety."" Horse galloping, thunder rumbling, and war noises have such a precise quality to them, that I absolutely recommend you listen to this movie on a good surround sound setup and prepare to have your room shake. My favorite aspect of the audio, however would have to be the score. As I said about Williams' score (also nominated for an Oscar, by the way), the music really does help make the story that more endearing, and it was a wonderful thing to hear in a 7-channel mix. Definitely show this disc of to your friends if they have any doubts about lossless audio.

Extras - (n/a)

This is actually a rental from Netflix at the moment. I could review the extras from the first disc, but I'm a bit of a completionist and would rather have the entire set to review, so I'll edit this whenever I own the entire 4-disc set.

Overall - 5.0

War Horse really caught me by surprise. I thought very little of this film from the initial trailers, but I'm so glad it exceeded my expectations. Instead of being just a story about a boy and his horse, it goes so much more beyond that. It's about bonding and the strength it give us to endure through tough, difficult situations like separation, loss, and other hardships we may encounter through life. But as long as the bond stays strong and we continue to drive ourselves, that feeling can go even beyond human perception and show through animals. The message itself is a great one, and my only real gripe with the film is that the wartime stuff wasn't graphic enough to really show how horrible it is. Then again, I could just watch grittier stuff like Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan. But with a very moving story, reference video and audio, and I guess a healthy amount of extras whenever I actually get around to reviewing them, War Horse comes highly recommended.",1357344000,2,9650,4.745974955277281

My students worked on a research website last year whose focus was rescuing horses, and preventing them from being sent to slaughter houses for their meat. We learned so much about horses and their empathetic ways. Horses should never be killed for their meat. To do so is a tragedy. This movie reinforces the bond that man and horse have had for centuries. I loved the Devon location at the beginning of the movie, and the beautiful cinematography. I appreciated seeing the camaraderie between the English and German soldier who rescued Joey from the barbed wire.

This is a family movie, a family story, set it a violent time in history ... it is however without the extreme graphic nature of many wartime depictions, and concentrates more on the emotional side.

5051370,2,B0072GPQNG,"I went into this movie expecting more great storytelling from Spielberg. Alas, this one doesn't meet the lofty standards set by most of his other films.

Right off, the film delves into syrupy storytelling. The characters don't feel like real people; they feel tacked-on and caricatured.

There are also has some narrative problems with the overall plot. Once Joey (the horse) leaves the farm, it is apparent that the focus of the story is him.
However, as new characters are introduced, the focus shifts away from Joey and onto them. Then, as soon as those characters are left or killed off, the focus shifts back to Joey.
The pacing is very poor because of this, and the message that Spielberg is trying to convey is quite muddled.

Yet another issue is the banal and maudlin dialogue. At times it genuinely felt as if I was watching a Hallmark film.
Possibly the most egregious example of the poor dialogue is when the grandfather is speaking to his granddaughter about carrier pigeons.
The scene tries so very hard to be poignant and inspiring, but unfortunately, it comes across as saccharine and schmaltzy.

I won't say the film is horrible, as it does still have some moments of inspiration. But regrettably, these moments are few and far between.",1354147200,,1254,4.818604651162791

5051378,3,B0072GPQNG,"Spielberg has a long history as a master story-teller for both children and adults and has made many five-star movies, but in `Warhorse' seems to have lost his magic touch.

Despite a lavish budget, spectacular set pieces and a very real-looking re-creation of the front-line horrors of the 1914-18 war, `Warhorse' is overall a cheesy and unconvincing affair with a so-so screenplay. Uncharacteristically (for Spielberg) poor editing contributes to a rather chopped-up storyline which lacks the usual powerful and engaging narrative continuity found in the films of this erstwhile great magician of the silver screen. The story is all there; it just isn't realised very well.

The film has many positives. Spielberg's classic large-scale cinematography is at times truly breathtaking; the horses are magnificently trained & highly photogenic; the soundtrack is good; the attention to period detail exemplary - as far as this non-expert reviewer can tell.

However the film's failings make for quite a list: poor casting, unconvincing acting, some peculiar and not-quite-right British regional accents, Germans unfortunately speaking English to each other with German accents (is the audience really judged to be so dumb that they can't read subtitles?), some beyond-believable plot devices which verge on the embarrassing, excessive sentimentality - one of Spielberg's consistent failings but usually offset by his excellent narrative storytelling - together with the poor editing and deficiencies in script make for an uninvolving viewing experience.

The film's main failing, however, remains that it is unsure of its audience. Is it a feel-good film for kids? The war scenes are surely too bloody, violent and upsetting for small children. At the same time it's too simplistic, predictable and cheesy to succeed as a serious film for grown-ups. Either way we don't care enough about the characters - except maybe the horse. This unfortunately condemns the film as one of the director's less successful efforts, and will probably deny it `classic' status in future years. You can't help but feel that with such a generous budget and experienced film maker, a better result might have been offered.",1353542400,,2199,5.421052631578948

5051384,4,B0072GPQNG,"What is there not to like about a movie (even if based, or maybe particularly because it is based on a children's novel) about a man (okay, a boy starting out) and his horse, their bonding together, their trials and tribulations and their successes (if that is an appropriate term in the midst of bloody carnage).Well, nothing, nothing on this good green earth (and the slice of England portrayed in the film is a very good example of that).

Nothing, except man getting in the way of an obviously smarter member of the animal kingdom, one Joey the horse. Why?  Well, man and horse come of age just around the time of World War I when ""civilized"" Europe decided that a war to end all wars (they came up a little short, about 300 plus wars somewhere on the planet short since, on that proposition) was necessary to sort things out. So England and its colonies, France and its colonies, Russia and its colonies, and German and its colonies, decided to tear up half of continental Europe to see who the king hell king was anyway. And this war to end all wars happened to occur at just that point when humankind had exponentially increased its technological capacity to kill, to murder, and to maim at will.

But not at 2012 levels, so one Joey the horse got ""drafted"" into the war and wound  up ""serving,"" one way or the other, both sides as beast of burden. But modern wars are not kind to those military whizzes who lived (pardon the expression) in the ""horse and buggy era,"" in the thinking of the last war, and so produced sickeningly destructive trench static warfare complete with barbed wire, maddened gas attacks, cavalry charges against fixed machine gun positions and used horse, including Joey (and his horse friend) to lug artillery into position. Madness, pure and simple.
And that is where Joey, unlike the Brits, Germans, etc. showed he was smarter than all those guys who knowingly and hopelessly kept going up over those bloody trenches without a murmur. When he had the chance he ran like hell, he ""deserted"" like any sane person would. And lived to tell about it (or have it told). Chalk one up for the horse set. And see this film as we near the one hundredth anniversary of the start of World War I in 1914.",1353024000,2,2225,4.555
5051385,2,B0072GPQNG,"Sometimes I have to wonder if Stephen Spielberg is dead-set on making the most depressing movies of the decade. He has certainly succeeded in the painfully long, abhorrently abusive War Horse, a film based on a novel that if I had my way never would have been written in the first place. It's Black Beauty all over again, only worse this time around.

How many ways can I express my hatred for this movie? By the end of it, I was so mad I went off on a ten minute rant about how the idiot who wrote the book should be shot. Is there a category for the most depressing stories ever written? If so, this one would win hands down. There are occasional moments of brevity, but really the plot just goes from one horrible thing to another. I'm an unapologetic animal lover, and it was all I could do to watch horses be flogged, shot, and worked to death in the trenches. By the time Joey runs through a battlefield and  becomes tangled up in the wire, I was downright mad.

Yes, the cast is terrific. It includes, among others, Benedict Cumberbatch, Emma Watson, David Thewlis, and others. The music is beautiful, the camera work memorable, and it does hit a lot of emotional notes. If I could rewind time and never rent this, I'd be happy about it.

She told me it was written from the viewpoint of the horse. Well, with that information in mind I concluded before the movie even started that it was going to be a waste of time, and it doesn't help that I'm not a huge fan for movies about horses.

As soon as the movie started with Joey the horse being born and showed him fresh out of the womb, I was hooked. It follows Joey's life, from the point he was separated from his mother to a more experienced animal that understands life more so than most human beings. Joey proved to be very loyal and very brave. Even when the world was in complete hell around him and sometimes let him down, this horse never gave up. Joey stepped in for his friend, the black horse [don't know his name] time and time again, and he took the hurt and pain just so his friend wouldn't have to endure. This movie was not so much about the human caretakers, in my opinion, but the undying love, loyalty, and pain of this beautiful animal. After all, it is called War Horse, not War Human.

I am glad I sat down to watch this movie. I like Spielberg movies anyway, and he won me over with this one, too. I laughed, I cried, and I was amazed. I think when a movie does that, it has done its job at entertaining me.",1350172800,4,1367,4.135338345864661

5051400,4,B0072GPQNG,"When you start watching ""War Horse"" movie, make sure you carve out 2.5 hours out of your time to watch this wonderful movie.  The story is set in early 1900s in England just before an onset of the Great War.  A young man from rural England finds himself training a horse to plow fields in the area that is clearly hostile to any agricultural endeavor.  The horse itself is a magnificent animal.  He is not a work horse; he is smaller and more fit to be a race horse than anything else.  His personality is amazing and before long, young man Albert and this new horse he names Joey create unbreakable bond.

As Wold War I breaks out and Germany declares war on England, Joey is sold to the British army to help out during the war.  His young caretaker is heartbroken from being separated from the animal that is clearly his great companion.  Joey first becomes officer's horse, but as war goes on his destiny leads him from British to German and then French population.  Joey makes friendhip with another horse as equally beautiful and honorable as himself.  As story evolves, we see how at times of war people of all backgrounds and all generations are able to connect with this amazing animal that allows them to connect with their own humanity.  Joey is able to give them back their dignity, love and understanding that even humans lose touch with after seeing all the horrors of the war.

I will not retell the movie, because it will spoil the viewing of another Steven Speilberg's hearwarming story.  This film is meant for all generations.  It has moments that are touching and deeply emotional.  I enjoyed this film from start to finish.",1349395200,2,1643,4.597938144329897

5051409,4,B0072GPQNG,"This review is SPOILERS
The boy raises the horse (Joey) up and off it goes to war, sold without his consent to save the family farm.  The empathetic officer  who understands Joey's real value buys the horse and pledges the boy he will take good care of the horse.  Money paid is considered  rent and the fine animal will be returned once he comes back from the war.

A few weeks / months later, the boy receives the sketchbook of the officer and learns he was killed in action. To the now distraught boy, upset that Joey might have been killed as well console their son saying it was possible Joey was nowhere near the the officer. Therefore Joey may still be alive and perfectly fine.  Meaning the boy cared more about the horse than the dead officer.  In retrospect this is perhaps ""natural,"" it is a movie about a horse and after all, the boy knew the officer for all of 5 minutes while doting over the animal for several years.

Plot holes exist for dynamic effect, the girl gallops up a hill and is in the middle of a horde of German solders.  Could she not hear or at worst, see the Germans as she poked her head above the rise then turn about before she was in the middle of them?  Perhaps in the real world, yes, but that does not make for swell movie dramatics.

As the Germans retreated, the Joey finds himself trapped by a traveling British tank (possibly a Mark V).  The tank was alone, no other troops nearby, odd since such tanks usually have supporting infantry with them.  The horse reaches the a dead end blocked by wire and high steep embankments on all sides.  No way out for the horse.  No way out for the tank and its crew either, perfect spot for a German ambush, or get stuck.  WHERE in the HECK was that tank going?!?  One might think the crew would get a clue from Joey the Panicked Horse who was trying to escape.

The creepiest scene in my view was the towing of the German artillery.  The huge metal wheels and peculiar design of the heavy cannon ( possibly a 21 cm Mrser 10) made it a nightmarish weapon to behold.  The film makers did an exceptionally good job in depicting this behind the scenes horror.

I felt the most sympathy for the two German brothers.  The movie gave up a bit about their background and their family, concern for the younger brother, only 14 years old.  When the two became separated, the elder brother to take care of the horses and the younger, to march to the front, the elder boy, takes it upon himself to snatch the younger to protect him from possible death and spare their mother the grief of loss.  It ended badly for both of them, a haunting ""what if;"" they followed orders, like they signed up to do, for now that poor German mother would have no sons returning from the war.

Overall, I liked the movie, a good way to introduce aspects of World War I, its absurdities,  conundrums and overall unpleasantness.  The film asks us to stretch our  limits of believability at times , where no one wants to put out of its misery, a wired up suffering horse in the middle of no-man's land.  It might be possible to believe a German and an English solder, working to accomplish a mutually beneficial task, (they got together for Christmas back in 1914,) but uber-dark realism does not make for a good family movie about a horse.

OH YEAH, I LIKE it when my Germans / Japanese/ Africans and other non English speakers cite the Queens English perfectly.  This means I can LISTEN to the DVD as it plays WITHOUT having to look up at the TV screen disturbing me as I work on other things around the house.

+1 star  Non English speakers talk English
+1 stars  Feel good story
+2 star  interesting plot keeps my attention, the viewer travels with both the German and British armies and gets a taste of how the civilian population fared
+1 star  Good background and visual effects  (ie that German cannon, houses WWI battlefield, location shots)

5051412,2,B0072GPQNG,"When it comes to knowing what buttons to push to get an audience to experience a certain emotion,  I can't now think of a director better at that than Steven Spielberg.
And once he's figured that out,  few are better at getting it up on the screen in full, state-of-the-art, cinematic splendor.  Very often, though,  I feel as if he's being too crafty, too manipulative, and too obvious.  Take, for example (spoiler alert!), the happy ending of ""War Horse.""  I felt like saying, ""Jeez... ease up a bit, Steven,"" when he set it against a spectacular, melting, water color sunset... just in case, maybe, some in the audience might not get that it was, in fact, a happy ending.
I also have at least one or two other bones to pick with ""War Horse.""  I thought Mr. Spielberg clearly trivialized and glossed over the unprecedented brutality of WWI, just for the sake of the feel-good story he wanted to tell.  And it was an insult to my intelligence that he asked the audience to believe that gassed, maimed and psychologically ravaged soldiers (from both sides) would be able to shove all those horrors into some corner of their consciousnesses just to care about the plight of a horse.  Sorry... that was a bit too much artistic license for my tastes.
Nevertheless, I have to admit that from the opening scenes, I cared about and rooted for Joey (the name of the war horse). But, then, I believe that was because I'm into horses... not due to any movie-making skills that Mr. Spielberg may or may not possess.  Truthfully, if I didn't love horses as much as I do,  I would have given this movie a single star since it was too contrived by at least several furlongs (eighths of a mile for those of you unfamiliar with horse racing).",1347235200,,1727,4.55663430420712

5051429,4,B0072GPQNG,"The story is written from Joey's perspective, in the first person. This was a little awkward for me at first, but Morpurgo does a good job of making the point of view believable. Joey can't talk with other people or animals, though he shares his thoughts with the reader. His interactions with others are the same as you might expect from a horse, which adds to the believability.

Joey's limited knowledge of the world serves to add to the novel's themes. He doesn't understand boundaries, and as such there is no difference in his mind between England and France. He has no idea of nationality. He likes everybody all the same. The men around him, whether German or English or French, admire him as beautiful. Joey serves as a common thread between all people. If everyone can fall in love with a horse, then why can't they love one another, too? There's even a wonderful scene in No Man's Land where a Scotsman and a German wave a temporary truce to free Joey from barbed wire, converse about the tragedies of war, flip a coin for possession of the horse, and sadly reflect that in an hour they might be shooting at each other.

The novel's main weakness is that Joey, as a horse, can't do much to affect the story himself. He is guided along, as if on rails, and his destiny depends on where other men take him. However, Morpurgo writes the story in such a way that this isn't much of a problem. He is a horse, anyway.

This works well as Young Adult fiction, but even adults will find something to enjoy. While there is a lot of violence, much of it occurs outside of Joey's perspective. We know people die, but Joey rarely sees it happen. It's an easy read, and the perspective of horses in World War I is a unique topic. If you like horses and/or you're a war buff, you'll find something to enjoy here.",1346630400,3,1809,4.426426426426427

5051431,2,B0072GPQNG,"*This review contains mild spoilers* The biggest flaw of this movie is that so many characters come and go that I had a hard time feeling much of anything for them.  The first part of the story lasts the longest, but unfortunately contains, in my opinion, the poorest acting--Jeremy Irvine playing the main (human)character. He has a primary expression that he uses over and over again, he seems overly earnest and naive, and I never quite felt the feeling that he had for his horse. David Thewlis is a hoot as the landlord and it is a treat to see several other well known British/Irish actors.  Their parts,however,are so small that they are on the screen one minute and gone the next.  Tom Hiddleston is very good as the British officer who initially buys the horse.  His voice and  facial expressions convey the fear mixed with resolve of someone who is going to battle.  Benedict Cumberbatch, Patrick Kennedy, Liam Cunningham, Julian Wadham, Eddie Marsan and Pip Torrens all make brief appearances. The other main character, of course, is the horse.  I felt for the horse in the scenes where he is overworked and in the scene where he is caught in the wire, but the shots where he is a ""hero"" seem a bit forced and phony.  There is one scene where a British soldier and a German soldier come together to help the horse, and this scene is very well written and performed, if you can believe that it would actually happen in the first place.  Be prepared to suspend belief for many other scenes (German soldiers who speak flawless English--to each other even!,horses who apparently calming and quietly climb stairs in a cottage, the grandfather who hears about the ""miracle horse"" and somehow travels many miles and has a lot of money to buy it, an untrained horse who plows a huge, rock-filled field, a girl who gallops over a hill and supposedly runs into many German troops--what she couldn't hear them on the other side of the hill?, a horse that gallops through trenches filled with men--weren't war time trenches zig-zagged, by the way?) Although some scenes where hardened soldiers feel tender toward the horses are touching, many other scenes are so overly sentimental that they are cringe worthy (they have crowds of people standing around with gaping mouths and, of course, maudlin music in the background). In the end, War Horse is an okay movie, but I would suggest renting it or checking it out of the library.  It's not really something to see over and over again.",1346284800,2,2481,4.722222222222222
5051432,3,B0072GPQNG,"Like many Spielberg movies, ""War Horse"" is extremely sentimental - from the John Williams soundtrack to the writing. Sentimental movies can be very good; however, this movie failed to really get me to care too much for the characters, which is essential for a sentimental movie to work. Yes, it was nice how Albert bonded with the horse Joey and they defied the odds when it came to plowing a field. But Albert still didn't feel three-dimensional to me and he was the one character besides Joey which the movie spent the most time on.

I went in with the feeling that everything would work out just fine, so despite the setting being World War I, I never had a sense of danger. I expected a lot of sorta crazy things to happen if the two were to somehow get through the war together; however, there were too many unbelievable moments, not just mere coincidences. My favorite scenes were the grandfather and little girl in France who found the horse in their windmill. But how in the world did they not hear the regiment of German troops over the hill when he sent her off riding up the hill?

5051436,3,B0072GPQNG,"Firstly, I think it might be appropriate to share what ""War Horse"" is not.  It is not ""Saving Private Ryan in World War I"".  The realism and horror of war shown in Private Ryan, and for that matter Schindler's List, is not evident here.  No, the Great War of this film harkens further back into Spielberg's past, perhaps most closely akin to ""Empire of the Sun"".  Like the prison camp of Empire, this WWI is ... I'm not sure of the right word. Sanitized? Idealized?  No man's land is full of mud, but not of rats and body parts, and there's no incessant noise from shelling.  When an artillery shell does hit a trench full of men, bodies are thrown about whole.  Even in the much-talked about scene (minor spoiler!) of the horse trapped in the razor wire, there is very little blood, especially not on the face, and the horse doesn't ""scream"" in terror, a sound often mentioned in war memoirs as being the most horrifying sound on a battlefield.

It will sound like a criticism to start a review this way, but that was not my intention.  I think Spielberg deliberately toned down the horror of war (and by all accounts, the WWI trenches were more horrifying than the Normandy beaches) because those horrors would not necessarily register with a horse.  Would a horse recognize a disembodied arm?  Would it care about rats crawling in No Man's Land?  Unlikely.  Therefore, this really is the story of the titular War Horse (named, innocently, Joey).  We are meant to watch Joey.  We are meant to see things through Joey's eyes.  In one telling scene (another minor spoiler!) of a cavalry charge, we see large numbers of horses go careening through the enemy lines without their riders, who have been shot off.  Only briefly do we see any dead horses, and then they look like they might be sleeping.  In fact, all parts of the film are almost stereotyped - the cast seem almost to a man (and woman) to overact just a little.  This is clearly a deliberate choice of the director, if only because Emily Watson is unimpeachable in her talents, and she's just as bad (or good!) as the rest.  Now consider the cinematography - Janusz Kaminsky's pastoral settings of rural England and France (behind the lines) are bold over-saturated colours of yellows, browns, and greens.  Presumably this represents the ideal setting for Joey.  In contrast the war scenes, where Joey is forced to pull artillery, surrounded by death and destruction, the palate is completely washed out grey.  There is none of the usual Kaminsky subtlety here, again a deliberate use of colour to emphasize mood more in keeping with a simple horse's point of view than that of an Oscar-winning DP.  Even John Williams's score is often too bold, with brassy, upbeat rythms that are compulsively musical, not what you'd expect for a Great War film.

The film is skillfully made.  But is it a ""good"" film?  I suspect opinions will vary widely.  At one end, the horse's ""acting"" is a truly astonishing achievement.  Even so, for a Spielberg film, for me it falls somewhere behind his true classics (from Jaws through Raiders of the Lost Ark to Saving Private Ryan).  I don't think it ever really pulled me in completely.  This might partly be because of its episodic nature - Joey is the only constant, he moves from owner-to-owner right up to the last 15 minutes of the film.  In that last 15 minutes there are some reappearances of former owners (I will not say which ones!), but it's not enough.  True, the very end (the last 2 minutes, say) are emotionally moving and even uplifting, but with a cloying sentimentality - surely a deliberate choice - that seems manipulative in hindsight.  Again, perhaps like Empire of the Sun, this film hovers at the boundry of adult fare and ""family"" fare - not wanting to go too far into realism, but too much for the kids to enjoy.

Overall it's a good film, but not one that I would compulsively watch if it came on TV late at night.  Perhaps I'm just too much a product of the ""cynical era"" to be able to totally enjoy a thickly troweled sentiment, no matter how skillfully made it is (and ""thickly troweled"" is rather cynical of me, isn't it?). In a rating system of 5 stars, I find it falls in the middle of the 3-star and 4-star range.  So why did I go with 3/5?  Because of the Blu-ray extras.  There are very few here.  A roundtable with a few of the actors and producers, a 3-minute short on the extras, and that's it.  I, for one, would love to have seen how the movie was created - especially the scenes of the horses at the front.  Was it a combination of computer graphics and live-action?  If so, it was totally seamless.  If it was all live action, how could you possibly get a horse to do what they did and still have healthy, living horses at the end of the shoot?",1345420800,,4779,4.539181286549708

5051440,4,B0072GPQNG,"My first thoughts after watching this film was not particularly positive. I thought it was too long. However I could not get the film out of my mind. Images from the film kept appearing in my head. A second viewing made me realize why the film was one of the Best Picture nominations for 2011. As with other Best Picture nominations, academy members are attracted to and recognize high quality filmmaking. There should be no doubt that 'War Horse' qualifies as an example of outstanding production and acting. In lesser hands, 'War Horse' would have been an average attempt at epic filmmaking, but Spielberg is an artist and it shows in this production of beautifully staged set pieces.

'War Horse' is a film about a rural English family in the early part of the Twentieth Century that buys a thoroughbred horse that they name Joey for an exorbitant price that they cannot afford. They also needed a quarter horse, a work horse, and not a race horse for farm work. The young son of the family convinces his parents that he can make the horse productive and help save the farm. His efforts fail and Joey is sold to the army at the beginning of WW I. The son, Albert, vows that he and Joey will someday be reunited. We then follow Joey through 4 years of war and different owners.

Joey is the centerpiece of an episodic plot line which is how the original book and play was presented. Some film goers may be turned off by this. But if they look at the film in terms of plot they are missing what this film is really about. This is a film about a horse and the lives of the people he influences. There is no romance, no sex. This is a PG-13 film. War violence is present but understated. Several times, the camera looks away or conceals by foreground objects scenes that would have earned the film an 'R' rating. This is a film that could have been filmed as an historical epics of the 1960's. The retro feel of the film is just what this movie is about. Spielberg set out to create a 1960's-like film such as one that might have been made by David Lean.

 The film is old fashioned in that it takes its time to tell the story. No digital camera here. It was all filmed on celluloid. No CGI except for a brief animal scene. All animal scenes are real. The camera lingers on every scene. The pastoral beauty of Southwestern England and the trenches of WW I is captured without digital fakery.

I recommend this film as one of the best of 2011.",1345075200,6,2441,4.3915929203539825
5051441,5,B0072GPQNG,"Once again, I am taking a different angle on a movie that, on the surface, appears to be about the heroic triumph of an ""exceptional"" horse. To me, it is about the heroic triumph of the human spirit, as manifested by the individuals whom the horse, Joey, encounters during his lifetime. At each crossroad the horse encounters, with peril and death on one side and salvation on the other, an individual arises to assist the horse and facilitate his survival, often at great risk to themselves.

SPOILER ALERT: Albert and his father save Joey from an ignominious life. The English officer selects Joey as his personal mount, promising to protect him. The German brothers shelter and protect Joey while in German hands. The Grandfather and his granddaughter rescue Joey from the Germans temporarily. Once back in German hands, the horse is again sheltered and protected by the enlisted man in charge of horses. In a pivotal scene, both a German and English soldier risk their lives to extricate Joey from barbed wire. The horse is spared from euthanasia by a caring English doctor, sensing the special bond between Joey and Albert....etc. etc. It should be noted that saviors arise from all walks of life and on both sides of the wartime conflict. In this respect it is much more even-handed than most productions, thus making its message more universal.

Secondly, there are no real ""villains"". War is depicted as a futile horror, but the people involved in it do not inflict needless harm on the horse. Joey is forced to pull a huge cannon (with human assistance) to the top of a hill, but this is not done out of cruelty but rather perceived necessity by the soldiers who possess him. In addition, this bit of ""cruelty"" is no worse than that inflicted by Joey's initial saviors when he was forced to plow a hard and rock-strewn field...again, perceived necessity. Unlike most traditional ""noble animal"" stories, no one goes out of their way to inflict suffering on the horse, he, like the humans he coexists with, suffer together.

In conclusion, the horse demonstrates great nobility during his adventures, but so do the humans he encounters. Indeed, without them to guide and assist him on his way, his story would have been much shorter....and much less noble. For this reason, I feel this story was elevated far above the standard ""animal in peril"" tearjerker. It presents scenarios in which good people risk their lives to do good deeds for a good animal, and thus portrays a triumph of the spirit of both humans and horse.",1345075200,4,2528,4.820276497695852

5051452,3,B0072GPQNG,"Steven Spielberg's drama War Horse is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's a good story with drama and comedy. On the other hand, the characters are underdeveloped, and there's no resolution to the initial problem with the landlord. It's long, but not long enough. And the stories never intersect with each other with Joey being the sole focus of the film. Not a bad idea in principal, but in theory, it doesn't work. The film should have shown Emilie at the end with her grandfather, Joey and the Narracott family.  And the score by John Williams was powerful as always. A comeuppance for the landlord's arrogant (and apparently womanizing) son should have been shown, along with a romance for the young Narracott boy.

The finale, though, was beautifully filmed. Reminiscent of Rhett kissing Scarlett amidst the burning night sky in Gone With The Wind. And the duck was hilarious.

A better, cohesive script would so have served the movie well, along with a longer run time.

5051453,1,B0072GPQNG,"When somebody asks me if I've ever seen a BAD Spielberg movie I can now say that yes, yes I have! The best metaphor I can think of to describe this movie is as a ""candy-coated children's fantasy."" One should not go into this movie with the expectation of any kind of realism in terms of human nature, war, or the intelligence of horses. Since the protagonist of this story is the horse itself, this movie is more akin to lighthearted animal tales such as ""Babe,"" or ""Racing Stripes.""

If you are able to suspend belief enough to accept that a horse is gifted with abnormal intelligence, that farm laborers in rural 1914 England displayed deep and meaningful relationships with their working farm animals (as opposed to the historically cruel treatment of animals during that period), and if you are okay with actually seeing the squibs (fire crackers) popping off in the mud and cannon barrels  in order to simulate gunfire (these effects were really badly done; you'll literally see little squibs going off and only afterwards realize that they were meant to be ""gunfire"") then by all means watch this movie. The fact that the Germans and French all speak perfect English in this movie and that the horse is apparently bulletproof will probably not phase you then.

However, if you are an adult who knows anything at all about history, war, horses, or anything to do with reality at all, then this movie will most likely seem ridiculous. Within fifteen minutes of watching it I was sure it should have rather been a straight to DVD title.",1343088000,5,1539,4.713754646840148
5051454,5,B0072GPQNG,"Wow we enjoyed this movie very much.
I will order one in blu-ray for our collection.
Great Film For The Whole Family PG 13",1342742400,3,122,4.125
5051455,1,B0072GPQNG,"I'll admit, I wasn't walking into this film with the highest of expectations.  Even from the trailer, the film looked like a misguided campfest complete with overly saccharine elements and cringe worthy plot points.  What I got was pretty much what I expected, so I guess I shouldn't be so let down.  I guess what really upsets me the most here is that despite my initial assumptions about the film, part of me wanted to believe that the trailer misrepresented what Spielberg constructed and so there was a small part of me that expected to be proved wrong.

`War Horse' suffers from a lot of things.  In fact, I'm scrapping the bottom of the barrel trying to find something of merit here, but even the obvious (""wow, it is so pretty to look at"") can be debunked when scrutinized (I'll get to that in a minute).

First things first though; this story is ridiculous.  I know that many a story has been told about the effect an animal will have on a household or a community or just a young boy.  Most of these stories revolve around dogs and so it has become almost acceptable for that to be the case.  Lap it up, because we all bawl our eyes out when Old Yeller gets `put down'.  There is something odd though about the fixation formed on this horse.  Sure, horse movies aren't new and there are some told with true affection, but nothing about the relationship formed between Albert and his horse Joey feels genuine.  I blame the script and or Spielberg's shoddy direction for that.  I mean, there is no relationship developed here at all.  Because of that, we could really care less about the rest of this movie.  Sure, sell the horse.  Let is gallivant through the war touching lives like Forrest Gump.  Problem is, you've got scattered segments showing very little in the way of character development that the horse because nothing but a pretty prop.  When an elderly man makes a claim that Joey was the light of his granddaughter's life I'm left shrugging my shoulders because I saw her pet the thing once and ride it for all of thirty seconds before some soldiers took it away from her.  Basically, I don't care how she felt about the horse because it wasn't shown to me here.

And then you just have the uncomfortable way in which Albert's affections for the horse are displayed.  It makes young Albert appear to be a simpleton.  I mean, I understand that he is younger than he looks (he attempts to pass for nineteen so as to stay alongside Joey when he's sold to a soldier) but he is still supposed to be a teenager of driving age and yet he basically wets himself when a soldier mails him a drawing he made of the horse.  It just feels so, unnatural.  It isn't compelling and it doesn't endear him to us.  Beyond the fact that I saw no reason to be attached considering that Spielberg didn't even try to add weight to the relationship between the boy and the horse, I just found his pining annoying.

Then you have the heavily manipulated ending, which was nauseating in its forcible sentimentality.  The whole tone of the film is a miss, considering that parts feel like it was reaching for family comedy (that goose) and other parts trying for tense drama (fail) and yet other parts were so embarrassing I felt like I was watching a fake film, like those created for `Tropic Thunder'.

The acting by everyone outside of Jeremy Irvine is very good, I will say.  Problem is, no one is really on screen long enough to build a character (outside of Irvine, Mullan and Watson who carry the film's first hour).  And then you have the cinematography, which is the `obvious' part I was referring to on the outset of my review.  I'm sorry, but this was too much.  I love a good showy celluloid frame.  I mean, films like `Atonement' and `The Tree of Life' are just so catching and heartstopping.  `War Horse' tries to go there.  The trailer alone was basically an FYC add for the film's cinematographer.  Instead though, the film's canvas seems ripped from other films and the way the shots are framed is almost comical.  Is it just me or does everyone in the first hour appear to be dwarfs?  The framing is ghastly!  It gets better, but then it goes all `Gone With the Wind' in the final frames (seriously) and I had to roll my eyes again.

Having now seen all of the nominated films from Oscar's Best Picture ballot last year, I'm baffled this was included.

The film lost me early on when the Dad was forced to sell the horse to the army.  The son was expectedly upset so the lieutenant told the boy he would personally take care of the horse and treat it like family.  Oh boy!  If that wasn't bad enough, the lieutenant wrote a letter to the boy to tell him how the horse was doing.  Keep in mind, this wasn't a 10 year old boy.  He looked to be 18.  Even worse was the so-called war scene where the allies and germans were fighting from opposite bunkers.

5051463,4,B0072GPQNG,"War Horse is the kind of movie that tells an in depth story about a horse and the many people who happen to share the life of that horse during a turbulent period when the world was at war. The story starts with the birth of the horse and follows its development as it grows and begins to learn the life lessons it will need to survive.

The pace is relaxed and the scenery is lovely as the viewer follows the series of events that shape the lives of the horse and the people who love and appreciate the horse. Things take a turn for the turbulent when England is plunged into World War I. No one was prepared for what was about to happen, neither man nor beast.

Events quickly move across the English Channel to the battlefields in France where the viewer is exposed to the extremes of life in battle situations. The story follows the events that surround the horse and one sees the concerns expressed by most that come in contact with the horse.

There follows some intense scenes that will be disturbing to the sensitive involving both man and animal. The brutality of warfare is shown to impact all equally.

The ending of the movie brings closure and a resolution of the major tension of the movie, the relationship between the boy and the horse he loves.

It had a story, a plot that tugged at your heart strings and made one think about the prices that have been paid by the previous generations for the freedoms we enjoy today. It also makes one realize the heavy price paid by those not even in the military during the times of war.

I'm not usually cynical and, irrationally, I enjoy a good rom-com or movie with an element of the proposterous, however this film has more Hollywood clichs than even I can cope with, (spoiler alert),:
The drunken waster of a father who turns out to be a war hero.
The horse doing something it should never be capable of, at the very last minute, in order to help the family keep the farm.
The horse, along with it's 'best pal horse' somehow managing to climb into a windmill, along with the sick young girl it has given hope to, to hide from the Germans.
And so on, and on and on, until the horse and the young boy, (now man), that originally befriends him return home from war in a twilight scene shoot in such unnatural colours that anybody experiencing such a sky would be 'running for cover', thinking the end of the world had come.

The calvalry charging through a line of machine guns and not stopping to kill the gunners? Phosgene gas spreading at the speed of sound?

Once the story moved onto the battlefield the movie makers seemed to give up on the dialogue altogether and we got endless beauty/heroic shots of the horse and main character. This part seems to have been produced with the sole object of making 9 year old girls cry. I can't review the end of the movie because with less than 20 minutes to go I gave up and stopped watching.

To me, Seabiscuit is the definitive horse movie.  It captured the majesty, speed, and emotion of horses and the people that love them.  I didn't feel that at all here.  The horse travels through the war from one character to another that I don't care about until the end.

Spielberg makes a Disneyfied war film! That sums this one up. I loved many moments of War Horse; the horse is indeed magnificent, and some of the acting is very good. But holy cow is this overblown.

Spielberg is so good at tugging heart strings by now that it often feels manipulative. The overuse of filters and fey lighting effects to evoke precisely the emotion he wants out of you is starting to feel more and more cheesy, never more so than in some scenes here. It's just way too in your face and obvious, without the subtleties that make a truly great film.

And nothing is more overblown here than the music, which is by far Williams' most over the top, saccharine score. The man is a genius, no doubt, but you would never hear Herrman or Morricone stooping to such obvious cues as some of these. His music often telegraphs what we're supposed to feel way before the script and actors do, and I hate that sort of manipulation, even from a master. Or perhaps particularly from a master.

And while most of the acting is at least solid, the only role that leaps to majestic life, besides the horse's, is Niestrup's. That guy can act! I really felt him, in the close way that Spielberg wants us to feel everyone here. But he's the only guy who underplays enough to compensate for SS's overblown everything else. Very nicely done, sir.

All in all, War Horse is 20 or 30 minutes too long, and just too cheesy to be as great as it very clearly wants to be. But, I love its love for animals (though animal and especially horse lovers, be warned: there are more animals killed here than will be comfortable for most), and its heart is certainly in the right place.

But while the blu-ray transfer is very fine, there are few extras, mainly a 20-minute interview bit with SS and longtime co-workers, wherein many of them look very uncomfortable and wondering why they have to sit there while Steve coaxes something quotable from them, and, failing that, speaks for them (as they wince mildly, reminding themselves that this is Spielberg after all, and future work with The Master means putting up with such cheese).

But then as Monty Python reminds us, blessed are the cheesemakers, and
at this point in his career there are no directors of fine dairy cinema who can hold a tallow candle to Steven Spielberg, master manipulator and artisanal cheese purveyor.",1337990400,,2370,4.588652482269503

affecting production.  It is a film story expertly told, aided and abetted to good effect by the latest cinematic technical tools available.  The WWI battle scenes are especially involving and exciting.

If any faults are to be found it would be in the seemingly overlong beginning sequences, where the bond between boy and horse are established.  While certainly necessary for story development,
the forward motion of the film temporarily bogs down here a bit.  Additionally, I feel that the film closes perhaps three or four times, where one time would have been more effective.  It is for these
reasons that War Horse has lost it's fourth star in my evaluation.

There are touching moments, but I got very tired of listening to horsing constantly making noise, which is uncharacteristic, and putting up with things that would never have worked to train a horse.

Ten minutes in we suspect it, but by the one hour mark, we are utterly convinced of the thesis Spielberg set out to prove with this film: This boy is gay for his horse.

There are no two ways about it. Spielberg sets out, argues and concludes his case in one of the most convincing films of all time. This film leaves no doubt whatsoever in the viewer's mind that, this kid loves horses.  Big time.  You will walk away with the absolute knowledge that this kid loves horses.  Loves looking at them, loves crying about them, loves walking beside them, hugging them, feeding them fruit, thinking about them, dreaming about them, looking at pictures of them, putting collars on them, telling his friends about them, writing letters about them...

War Horse.

Also, the horse goes on some adventures, some more interesting than others.

I recommend this if you have a giant picture of a horse on your bedroom ceiling. Otherwise, you can probably take or leave it.",1337385600,2,1947,4.6

5051531,5,B0072GPQNG,"Steven Spielberg has made a magnificent movie with his splendid 'War Horse'. It is breath-taking both for the scope of the story and the broad panoramic scenery displayed for the viewers. A friend and I watched it recently at her house, and after it was over there was a long silence. 'I'm now going to adopt five senior horses for my rescue shelter', my friend finally said in a tremulous voice. 'This is surprising coming from you', I replied attempting to steady my voice and added: 'I thought you weren't too keen on horses; you've never mentioned them before these beautiful and courageous animals'. 'War Horse' made me think of all the many centuries through history when horses have been sent into deadly combat. The legendary Bucephalus came to mind, the mighty scar-battled stallion that Alexander the Great rode through many conquests to create his vast empire until the charger died of his wounds in 326B.C. The young Emperor went on to found the City of Bucephala in memory of his horse, whom he deemed immortal. And, then there are the unsung heroes symbolized by Joey the horse in Spielberg's movie. A colt raised on a farm lovingly by an adolescent boy, Joey and Albert are eventually swept up together in the terror of war, and it's all about the loyalty, courage and the noble bond shared between man and horse. It brings to mind the quote 'The winds of Heaven are those that blow between the ears of horses'. In remembrance of Traveller, Gimcrack, March and countless other brave hearts, and with appreciation to Mr. Spielberg for his latest and outstanding masterpiece.",1337212800,5,1588,4.82051282051282

5051535,3,B0072GPQNG,"For those of you with a sentimental bent, this is a lovely feel good about life, feel bad about war movie.  Unfortunately nothing in it is accurate about horses or how they learn.  Aside from the fact that the Germans come off like the Keystone Cops, my favorite ""this is ridiculous"" part is when one horse eyeballs another in order to ""teach?"" it to take the harness.  This movie anthropomorphizes horses, giving them human motivations and desires.  Emily Watson is brilliant, but has very little to work with.  Surely with the budget Spielberg can command he could have hired some specialists to tell him how horses behave and respond?  I read the novel first, and that was bad enough.  Are horses amazing?  Yes.  Do they act like the trained horses in this movie, when they're being themselves?  No.  I was hoping for a real movie about what it takes to train a horse to ignore its natural instincts and respond to the rider rather than to the fear.  Unfortunately, this is not that movie.

5051538,3,B0072GPQNG,"Not what I expected--at least a decent storyline from Spielberg, known for his captivating (most of the time) narratives. Instead, what you get is a broken up narrative, told from the point of view of the ... horse. I would say five stories and a horse (or horses, for several were used in the filming), and a cycle of boy-horse love affair, forgotten until just about everyone in Europe during the war took possession of it, until it returns to its original owner. To be fair, some good battle scenes--the charge of horses/cavalry against German machine guns, reminding of Lawrence of Arabia, (a film Spelberg treasured) with different results.  Good luck to those who choose to see it, but if you must, the advice is to see it in two nights. It might ease the tedium. Or make for a better movie.",1337040000,,797,4.612676056338028

I'm a pushover for epic movies, period pieces, horses, good stories, great acting and great cinematography.  War Horse has them all, plus a very uplifting ending.  While War Horse was spectacular on the big screen, the video version loses nothing when viewed on the small screen.  War Horse should have been voted Best Picture at the Academy Awards, as it is the most moving film I have ever seen.

5051552,2,B0072GPQNG,"Wow, where to start?  This movie fails on so many levels.  Just finished watching this dreadful piece of cinema with my 12 year old.  We both read the book, and neither of us saw the play.  Suffice it to say that although the book is a bit melodramatic, it is far more believable and touching  than this wreck of a movie.  As usual, Spielberg's bigotry towards the German people seeps through and I can't help but wonder if part of the change in storyline from book to movie was driven by his unwillingness to show Germans in a positive light.  The acting is adequate, but I have to say that none of the actors ever had me convinced of their love for the title animal.  It is surprising that the director who gave us some of the most moving combat footage ever in a movie in Saving Private Ryan, seemed far less capable in communicating the terror and horror associated with trench warfare.  Cinematically the movie is shot very well, but the story deviations, lack of great acting and failure to live up to what I think most expected of this movie leaves it with 2 stars in my book.",1336521600,2,1083,4.375

5051556,2,B0072GPQNG,"This was a good story, but the production was almost amaturish.

5051558,5,B0072GPQNG,"I totally enjoyed this movie and will be watching it again. It was a horse story, and the love of a boy got him through the first year or two before he went off to war. It was an interesting concept from sort of, the horse's POV. What he went through with his companion or friend. The loss and scariness of the war was very well done. And so real in the way that horses were treated during the war, they were just to use and if they died so what, and the loss of so many horses and mules during WW1 was something else.
If you don't care for war stories you probably will be horrified over what these noble creatures had to endure, we usually don't see much of the horses in war movies, they are there, die and are gone. This shows what they went thru, and to survive was something else. It had a good ending that I was a little surprised to see.. I had an idea, but what happened, I was thrilled we got a bit more.
It was a good movie, heart stopping many times, but true to WW1 and the silent warriors who gave their lives for freedom.

5051559,2,B0072GPQNG,"I heard many good things about War Horse, it was a Spielberg movie, it deserved film of the year, etc. But I also heard some other opinions, that it wasn't a classic grand Spielberg movie of old. So my expectations were mixed when my family and I set down to watch War Horse.

At the half-way point of the movie, we were all feeling a bit let down. The movie was very slow and lacked any depth and excitement it wasn't anything new and unfortunately the story and pace never really picked up for the last half of the movie. In the end, the whole family was left with, so that's it? That was War Horse? There was nothing grand about this movie. The story was one that we have seen before, but they plugged a horse into the role. I was hoping for a lot more out of this film, but it didn't deliver.

I won't say it was a horrible movie, but there wasn't anything that pushed it to the great or even very good categories. 4-5 star movie this is definatly not.",1336435200,3,956,4.162162162162162

5051561,4,B0072GPQNG,"What does it take to make a grown man cry? Compassion, for one thing, will do it. And Steven Spielberg knows it and knows how to do it. Take for example what is probably Spielberg's least-heralded, yet most moving movie, 1989s ""Always,"" which among other thing stands as the final Big Screen appearance of Audrey Hepburn, as a guardian angel no less. Watching it for the umpteenth time on DVD a couple of weeks ago, even knowing the beginning, the ending and the full journey in between, I found it impossible to get through without misting up.

Speilberg's lastest effort taking the DVD route home is last year's War Horse. I saw it for the first time a couple of nights ago in its beautifully done Blu-ray edition. And this Vietnam Vet and semi-hardened reporter didn't just mist up. At several points, I was dabbing away actual tears.

War Horse, in simple terms, is the story of a thoroughbred named Joey who finds himself serving as a save-the-family-and-its-farm plough horse, then impressed into the  British Army on the eve of World War One as a cavalry officer's mount, his capture by the Germans, rescue of two conscript brothers, and his own rescue in turn by a young French girl and her grandfather for a sort of idyllic breather before heading back to war. The movie's climactic scene is set in a dark and deadly no-man's land between the British and German trenches where Joey triggers an act of compassion by two soldiers who, although enemies, find a common humanity through a horse.  Joey's journey is a string of such encounters, with his life touching humans from farm to war and back full circle.

The Blu-ray set of War Horse includes a fascinating assortment of making-of productions, most of them on a separate disc. We get a close look at Spielberg's noted attention to detail, lavished on the film by a set of colleagues he has assembled over the years, among them music-master John Williams and producer Kathleen Kennedy. It was Kennedy who broached the idea of War Horse as a movie to Spielberg after seeing the London production of the play. We see how an officer of the Humane Society helps ensure the safety of the animals who variously play Joey and the rest of the war horses  and include a comedic farm goose. And we see how the inspiring vistas of the British countryside of Dartmoor also double for the fields and villages of France.

We also learn how the sound designer created the stunning soundtrack.  Joey's vocalizations include the slowed-down sounds of miniature horses and the teeth-clicking chatter of affection the designer noticed his wife's horse makes whenever she approaches. In one pivotal scene, Joey's confrontation with a tank, a clattering new horse of war, there is no music, only the sounds of the horse and machine.

The photography is appropriately spectacular throughout. One panoramic sunset over the Dartmoor countryside brings to mind the vivid burning of Atlanta from Gone With the Wind.

In the whole two-hour-plus production, I did find one minor annoyance: the fake battlefield snow flakes toward the end. I kept waiting for somebody to choke on a mouthful of whatever the puffy plastic-looking flakes were. Instead of falling naturally toward the ground, they swirled sideways and upward. Why can't somebody come up with something that if not real snow, at least looks it. (See White Christmas, 1954)

Much more real: the rest of War Horse, particularly its compassion.",1336348800,2,3437,4.868150684931507

Unfortunately, once all the excellent cinematography is appreciated, the plot, the characters, the script, and the entire film descend into a cloying, maudlin, unwatchable abyss.

5051571,5,B0072GPQNG,"In 1982, Michael Morpurgo wrote the children's fiction novel ""War Horse"", a story set during the outbreak of World War I.

The book received its film adaptation courtesy of filmmaker Steven Spielberg and screenwriters Lee Hall and Richard Curtis and was released in theaters on Christmas day of 2011 and would earn over $173 million in the box office and in April 2012, the film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD.

""War Horse"" would reunite Steven Spielberg with the top talents in the film industry such as cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Minority Report""), editor Michael Kahn (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""), sound designer Gary Rydstrom (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Minority Report"", ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") and also reunited Spielberg with legendary composer John Williams (known for creating the soundtracks for the ""Star Wars"" films and ""Harry Potter"" films).

The film marks a new beginning for Steven Spielberg.  One, this is the first film in which Spielberg directed a film about a horse as the main character and portraying him at various stages of the horse's life.  The film also marks Spielberg's first time cutting the film digitally.

""War Horse"" would go on to earn six Academy Award nominations including ""Best Picture"" and would win the American Film Institute Award for ""Film of the Year 2011'.

VIDEO:

""War Horse"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:40:1).  When Steven Spielberg brought in cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, you get one of the best in the business.  A man who knows how to capture the shot and in this case, to capture the beauty of Dartmoor but also to capture the essence of peace and serenity via pre-war but also the darkness and fear during the war.  There are wonderful, breathtaking shots that are seen throughout the film with vibrant colors to lush greenery of the area.

There is also wonderful detail when it comes to the closeups of the horses and black levels were nice and deep.  I didn't catch any banding, artifacts or any problems with the overall video.  If anything, picture quality for ""War Horse"" is outstanding!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""War Horse"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHZ/24-bit), French 7.1 DTS-HD HR and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  Dialogue is crystal clear and there is amazing use of the surround channels.  From the beginning as Joey is plowing the field to the use of music courtesy of John Williams.  But the film shows how wonderful it could sound via lossless once we get to the war.

As one would expect from a film with war scenes, the film is absolutely immersive as you hear machine guns, tanks, cavalries and their horses marching and stomping to bomb blasts via LFE.  There is good use of the rear surround channels and panning through the surround channels and I was quite impressed by how the overall mix was.  ""War Horse"" has an amazing lossless soundtrack!

Also, the musical soundtrack is wonderful.  The music is inspired by the serenity of the British landscapes and manages to capture that feel of adventure but also the horse as it goes through its adventures.  John Williams approach was to utilize brass instruments.

The brass is the key to the music of ""War Horse"", creating emotion and feeling of the horse trough the ages.  Steven Spielberg said in the booklet notes of William's composition, ""I feel that John has made a special gift to me of this music, which was inspired not only by my film but also by my many of the picturesque settings of the poet William Wordsworth, whose vivid descriptions of the British landscape inspired much of what you're going to hear.  I'm not sure what I can give John in return, other than a promise of more films to come...for as many more years as we both can imagine!"".

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

EXTRAS:

""War Horse"" comes with a slipcover case, two Blu-rays (one for the film and the other for the special features), the DVD version of the film and a digital copy of the feature film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""War Horse"" is a film that captures the human spirit but most of all, Steven Spielberg ability to capture the relationship and emotions may it be an animal to an extra-terrestrial, it's one thing that Spielberg has been wonderful in doing.

We have seen Spielberg create a heartfelt film with ""E.T."", we have seen him recently capture human and animal relationships through adventures with ""The Adventures of Tin Tin"", but ""War Horse"" is a challenge that the filmmaker was ready to take on.

How would you be able to create a film based on a horse?  It's one thing to get the actors to be emotional and caring towards a horse but you have to capture the horse being interested as the actions must seem natural to the viewer.  And sure enough, with amazing trainers, the reactions by Joey the horse as it goes through a lot during its adventures is nothing short of amazing.

""War Horse"" is no doubt a collaborative film.  In order to make this film work, you would need a wonderful location, wonderful cinematography, costume and set design, music, sound design and talent and many extras in order to create this sense of dire during World War I.  Characters who come across the horse Joey and eventually are touched by it.  And of course, the trainers responsible in making the horse meet its mark (there are possibly over a hundred of horses used in this film, especially during the war scenes).

For one, ""War Horse"" is a gorgeous film.  Spielberg brought in his top guns for this film, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and editor Michael Kahn.  They have had a long working relationship with Spielberg and part of the believability of this film is its look.  From the peaceful pre-war landscapes to the muddy trenches during World War I.  You have the cinematography and editing there, you have the look courtesy of Lee Sandales on set decoration and Joanna Johnston via costume design.  Every soldier on opposing sides have a uniform and you eventually get the sense of how grand this film is.

And of course, when it comes to emotion, to help tie the characters to Joey, you have the wonderful music of John Williams.  And also the sound courtesy of sound designer Gary Rydstrom is absolute amazing.  If you are an audiophile, you will literally hear how immersive this lossless soundtrack truly is on Blu-ray.  It's one of the best lossless soundtracks that I have heard on Blu!

For the most part, everything came together for this film and I was quite impressed.

As for the Blu-ray release, the video and audio is absolutely magnificent.  There are many special features as well on two Blu-ray discs and you also get the DVD and digital copy version of the film with the 4-disc combo pack.

Overall, ""War Horse"" is a beautiful, moving and wonderful film capturing a horse and its ability to bring out the human spirit with the many people it comes across.  While it may not be as emotional as Robert Bresson's 1966 film ""Au hasard Balthazar"" nor do we see the cruelty the horse must go through from owner to owner, the film is not about the cruelty of man towards horse.  Nor is ""War Horse"" a war film.  It's about a horse that brings out the human spirit no matter who the owner is or whatever side the horse is being utilized.  The hope of one young man being reunited with his horse and that hope and even a bit of luck exists, even during dire circumstances.

Steven Spielberg and his crew once again has done a wonderful job and for those contemplating on this Blu-ray release, it really is magnificent.  Not just the film itself but its presentation, its picture quality and its fantastic lossless soundtrack.

""War Horse"" is highly recommended!",1336176000,,8716,4.808338937457969

I love animal movies but this would require me to destroy a bunch of brain cells to enjoy.  To the movie producers I say start paying writers,  good writers.  Special effects and appealing to our love of animals is not enough.  Get us a decent damn plot.  This could have been so much more.  It just was too far out there.

No cursing, and no bloody violence(for a change) made for a very relaxed viewing experience. And, I love happy endings - especially because happy endings are also hard to come by in this crazy world. Let me enjoy a little fantasy. Indulge me. There is entirely too much ""reality"" these days. Plus the movie really ends up implying - surprisingly - that war is indeed a racket. Yay! I could go on, but I've had a long day. Suffice it to say, I first saw this on VUDU, but liked it so much that I ordered the blu ray. Can't wait for the sequel. :) By the way, the picture and sound quality of the movie are hard to beat.",1335830400,,791,4.315436241610739

Too many wild coincidences.  Also, there was too much gratuitous sorrow and carnage that seemed to serve no purpose but to make the story seem... well, just plain dumb.

It wasn't worth the rental fee and I'm sorry I wasted time watching it.",1335830400,5,393,4.571428571428571

There were many people and horses left dead in this film and it was a miracle (if a true story) the horse and it's owner survived, but after all the death and carnage that was left behind I really found nothing happy or uplifting about the ending. Very dissapointed with this movie and I would not suggest showing this film to a horse lover or children under 12 years of age.

But who would buy an Arabian for a plough horse ? The script is awful and the story totally derivative. When I was a child, in World War II, I had a book called ""war dog."" It was about a boy's dog that was taken for the army. I wonder if it was the same story with the horse changed for the dog ? I am not ten years old anymore. The movie was disappointing.",1335657600,,509,4.151515151515151
5051596,5,B0072GPQNG,"Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvire) witnesses the birth of a foal in Devon England during 1912.  As the young horse and young man grow up together they see each other often but the colt is indifferent to Albert's attentions.  Albert's alcoholic father goes to a horse auction in the village and gets in a bidding war with the landlord of his farm.  He overbids and buys the colt as a plow horse even though he is a thoroughbred.  Now after overpaying for the horse they are unable to pay the rent on the farm and face eviction by the domineering landlord.

Albert tells is mom and dad that he will train and break the horse and help to use it to save the farm.  Albert names the horse Joey and an unbreakable bond is made between Albert and Joey.  Albert trains Joey to plow a rocky field to help save the farm as they have committed to plant turnips and pay the landlord his rent or be evicted.  After a major rainstorm and the loss of the crop, Albert's father sells Joey to the English Cavalry as WW I is just starting.

Joey is off to war and Albert is heartbroken that he has lost his horse and his friend. Albert is to young to join the army but a short time later, Albert is in the army fighting in the hell of WW I and trench warfare over no-man's land...

This movie is a wonderful and terrifying story about the bond between a man and his horse and the horrors of WW I.  Both fight to survive the cruelties of war and Albert's never ending search to find his prized horse are heart warming.  Both man and beast suffer terribly during the war and this movie brings forth the story of never giving up and finding your dream.

While the book is touted as a children's story the movie is rated PG-13 and contains graphic violence and cruelty.  Just be aware of this if you want to watch this with younger children. Millions died fighting WW I and the movie pulls no punches while filming the horrible aspects of trench warfare and the use of artillery, machine guns and poisonous gas. The storyline is excellent and the acting throughout the movie is of the highest quality.  In typical Spielberg fashion the movie is video graphically displayed like an artist's canvas painted by a master.

It is a good movie and you will enjoy it but it may not be suitable for the whole family is you have younger children!",1335657600,,2313,4.356643356643357

Sure, it's hardly a new theme, but it's an enduring one. The trick War Horse employs so well is using an animal to give us insight, via vignettes stretching over several years, into the minds and hearts of those on all sides of World War I. Joey the horse is wondrous to behold, but more than anything, he's a blank slate, allowing the audience to impart their own emotions into the story.",1335484800,,607,4.527272727272727

I would skip unless you are a horse person.",1335398400,,335,3.9402985074626864
5051603,2,B0072GPQNG,"Please don't read if you have not seen the movie.

I received ""War Horse"" as a present and, being the consummate horse lover, was partly excited and partly wary that this movie would be about putting an innocent animal through the depravity of war. My worst fears were realized and surpassed. Unfortunately for the movie, there were so few redeeming  qualities that if I almost couldn't finish it and then when I did, regretted the waste of 2.5 hours. Very bluntly put, it was a very poor attempt at remaking Black Beauty with the backdrop of WWI as the only major difference. A beautiful horse is born, finds a good owner, and then through the cruel twist of fate is passed from owner to owner endlessly, until almost at death's door, he is re-discovered by his original owner and saved. The movie even follows Black Beauty's plot down to killing ""Ginger"" and the original owner discovering their long lost horse by cleaning off defining markings (Black Beauty's star, Joey's socks). The movie was so horrifically predictable at every turn that I found myself hoping to be wrong when I, yet again, guessed the cliched scene (the death of the protagonists best friend in the trenches, the death of the big black horse, etc).

For more incongruities, the film is set in Europe and yet all the characters speak in english with accents. Are you telling me that french countrymen speak in english with french accents amongst themselves? Or that the german army spoke english with kaiser accents? I understand the difficulty of filming an entire film in a foreign language, but either do it properly with subtitles, or just have the audience accept that the characters are speaking their native tongues without the phony accents. And the girl hiding the horses in her bedroom? Did the germans search the entire house and leave her bedroom alone? And probably the worse Hollywood scene of the film was the grandfather coming all the way from the countryside because he ""heard of the miracle horse and knew which one it was"". What did Joey do that made him a miracle? And why could it not have been the big black instead? And how did Joey ""save his granddaughter's life"" as he mentioned? And what was the point of killing the granddaughter? These questions steal from the plot and potential of the movie. I could go on and on in a similar vein.

When I saw who directly the movie at the end, I was frankly amazed. Spielberg must be losing his touch or perhaps he just no longer gives his audience any credit for the capability of spotting the many,many errors and cliches that are rife within this film. In ending, save yourself some money and read/see the classic ""Black Beauty"" of which this movie is a truly a ghastly doppelganger.",1335398400,7,2727,4.698744769874477

5051611,4,B0072GPQNG,"There are scenes in Steven Spielberg's 2011 film ""War Horse"" so extraordinary you will have difficulty catching your breath. Filmed with such artistic imagination, one could argue they are some of the most unforgettable celluloid moments ever realized. A cavalry charge through a field of wheat, an execution framed by a windmill and a horse fighting through a battlefield's barbed wire are just a few incredible images Spielberg has forged from his naturally creative genius. At times I was awestruck by this family film, and disagree with many critics who argue it's too violent for children (maybe in the decades before 24-hour cable violence). But don't get me wrong, this is not a great Spielberg film as it suffers serious miscalculations.

Foremost, I found the performance of Jeremy Irvine in the teenage lead of Albert Narracott to be distractingly overwrought. I've read this was his debut, so it's puzzling filmmakers would cast someone so inexperienced for such a crucial role. He's practically on the verge of tears in every scene and never for a moment do I believe his angst. And did he have to look like a GQ model? As has been Spielberg's trademark, he enjoys casting unknown but usually talented actors for his films. The habit has succeeded more often than not (""Jaws,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/E-T-The-Extra-Terrestrial-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000A2IPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Widescreen Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empire-of-the-Sun/dp/B001N3P6SY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empire of the Sun</a>). It's clear Steven was attempting to recreate the glorious eras of old-fashioned Hollywood, with strokes reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Quiet-Man-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00006JMRD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Quiet Man (Collector's Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-with-the-Wind/dp/B002W7IH0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone with the Wind</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-Hur/dp/B000056BP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben-Hur</a>&nbsp;and, what the heck, let's throw in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Yearling/dp/B004H5X3XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Yearling</a>&nbsp;for good measure. But those sweeping technicolor epics had larger-than-life actors John Wayne, Clark Gable and Charlton Heston, and ""War Horse"" is in desperate need of such on-screen presence.

On the eve of World War I, a rural English farming family is struggling to survive in a green valley. Father Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), suffering from alcoholism in jovial Darby O'Gill tradition, gets into a bidding war over a horse with his well-scrubbed landlord. Rather than a plow horse, he brings a beautiful chestnut thoroughbred to his doorstep, and Mother Narracott (Emily Watson) is incensed at such costly folly. They're now in danger of losing the farm, but misty-eyed Albert loves the magical animal and teaches it to plow a rocky field. The turnip crops abruptly fail, war breaks out and Father Ted must sell the horse to the British Army to survive.

Thus begins an aggressively episodic series of chapters focusing exclusively on the regal horse as it attempts to survive the rigors of cavalry charges, machine guns and trench warfare. Albert enlists in the army and dreams of finding his equine pet. Yes, this is a fairy tale in the Walt Disney vein, and it is indeed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredible-Journey/dp/B003XQNZP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredible Journey</a>. The film is based on a British children's novel by Michael Morpurgo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-Horse/dp/B0071CNGI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War Horse</a>), which was adapted into a popular play, but the stark chapters erode emotional momentum and I had difficulty in relating to the horse's plight.

I appreciated the abrupt chapters, as we are introduced to a noble British captain (Tom Hiddleston), youthful German brothers (Leonard Carow, David Kross), and a French man and his granddaughter (Niels Arestrup, Celine Bukens) who make jam while cannons thunder on the horizon. Any one of these chapters would have made a fine film, but are shoehorned into a frantic two-plus hour running time and disappear far too quickly. The runaway story would have been better served as a television miniseries akin to Spielberg's executive produced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-of-Brothers/dp/B00006CXSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band of Brothers</a>.

Mostly I just didn't know how to feel about it. The first half felt like a kid's movie, with the cheesiness and over-earnest-ness. I got a bit bored and had more than one eyeroll. But I definitely wouldn't show my young kids the war scenes and second half, which had a tendency to get a little gruesome.

This is a beautiful film, and very good adaptation of the book. & While it is based on the play, and the book, it does stand on its own. A few of the scenes also differ from the novel, and are a little more violent. But, that happens in movies, and it doesn't take anything away from the story. Speilberg does an excellent job bringing the realities of war and what happened to the horses and their riders, during world war 1. the depiction of Albert's family, and the love he had for his horse was also amazing.

I read the book - a young adult book - and found the book to be a fair warning of the movie.  I cried while reading the book and cried even more while watching the movie.

It doesn't matter if it's an action/adventure, historical drama, or sci-fi film; his very name on the project means that even if it revolves around a horse, it will be a quality movie worth my time.

I wouldn't usually give a film about a horse the time of day. I wouldn't even consider watching it. Spielberg made me step out of my box and witness something different and captivating. I'm not going to tell you ""War Horse"" is the greatest film I've ever seen, but it is a spectacle to behold; the cinematography is nothing short of mesmerizing.

Fans of Steven Spielberg's movies will want to get ""War Horse"" right away. There are plenty of special features to keep consumers happy on the Blu-ray set, and the film will stand up to more than one viewing.

The movie will no doubt earn its place right next to ""Schindler's List,"" ""Amistad,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and Spielberg's other period pieces. Is it his best film? No, it isn't.

5051621,3,B0072GPQNG,"Stephen Spielberg's ""War Horse"" comes with a lot of expectations, as does any new film by Spielberg, but also like far too many of his movies it falls just short of it's full potential. Told in an epic and episodic form, this movie tries to reach back into the past of cinematic wonders like those epic spectacles that David Lean was so famous for. In many ways, this sort of ambition is doomed to fail outright, few filmmakers today can pull this off, but Spielberg should be one them. So, the real trouble I would guess lies in the story, it's too epic for the movie that was made.

The movie begins with an excruciatingly dull first quarter, filled with bland characters and cliched situations we've seen since the dawn of the cinema. I don't want to sound bloodthirsty, but the movie doesn't find it's footing until we get into the war, once this part of the movie begins the epic journey and adventures soon follow, this is where Spielberg is comfortable. The bulk of the movie is rousing and thrilling, but it's all undermined by a finale of such gross sentimentality and ""a you've got to be kidding me"" reunion, that I could hear chuckles, at least in my head.

""War Horse"" is beautiful to look at, gorgeous photography by Spielberg's long time cinematographer Janusz Kaminski assists the movie greatly. A fine cast of great British character actors (Emily Watson, Peter Mullen, David Thewlis, Liam Cunningham, Benedict Cumberbatch) populate the supporting roles, but make no mistake the film is about and rightfully belongs to Joey, the war horse of the title: neat trivia, Joey is played by the same horse who also played Seabuscuit a few years back. Add a rousing score by John Williams and as expected, this is one well made movie.

The story based on Michael Morpurgo's book is long, drawn out, rather sad, and I doubt the audience intended for this, that being the family film audience, will have the patience for this. I have very conflicting feelings for this movie, on one hand it is big and glorious to look at, and on the other it's too long and too slow, too uninvolving. I guess one's enjoyment for this movie will depend on the viewer.",1334534400,2,2156,4.653543307086614

The Sound is very great, the battle scenes take full advantage of all the speakers! The music by John Williams is very moving!

5051630,5,B0072GPQNG,"War Horse started as a children's novel in 1982 that more recently became an acclaimed stage show, a BBC radio drama and of course, it gets the full Steven Spielberg treatment in this Best Picture Oscar nominated epic. It's a DreamWorks film, and all of the studio's live action films are released by Walt Disney Pictures.

The film combines elements of the book and the stage production, but unlike the other versions, it is not told completely from the viewpoint of Joey, the horse, whose literal narration would not work as well in a film -- but the skill of the trainer, horse and director bring out remarkable ""acting"" in the lead equestrian

War Horse the movie is perhaps the most Disneyesque motion picture to come from director Spielberg. Especially in its opening segment, taking place in the rugged, breathtaking landscape of Devon and recalling the Disney sagas of yore such as The Three Lives of Thomasina, Darby O' Gill and especially the films Walt Disney produced entirely in the U.K.

It's very intense at times, since it is a war film, but the war scenes are heavy on spectacle and light on gore. The most difficult scene to watch, at least in our house, was the fate of the two very young German soldiers, which takes place on camera (and shot in a very evocative way at sunrise in the face of a windmill).

Every shot of War Horse is an experience in expert composition, art direction, authenticity and often understated acting. Spielberg, as seen in the very generous bonus materials, is an extremely collaborative filmmaker and knows how to best utilize the finest talent in front and behind the lens, from the superb cast to the stirring music of longtime collaborator John Williams.

Rather than have an audio commentary or a simultaneous online compliment to the film itself, the second disc in this four-disc combo is loaded with background material, including a feature length documentary about the making of the film and several shorter items about specific collaborators. Spielberg himself hosts a short round table on camera with members of the cast and crew.

Storywise, War Horse suggests an earlier British children's classic, Black Beauty, in that is chronicles the various owners, friends and foes of one particular horse, with a grand coincidence to tie it together. I have to say -- without a trace of irony or sarcasm -- that it also reminds me, in part, of the song ""Snoopy's Christmas,"" in which the WWI Flying Ace and the Red Baron suspend their deadly battle for a brief time because of a shared affinity (you'll know which scene I'm referring to if you saw the film already).

Since Spielberg and his creative team has meticulously crafted such a sweeping, magnificent film, it follows that it's particularly nice to see it on Blu-ray, which brings out every crag in the rugged countryside and the sheer size of the battle scenes, as well as some very lovely moments at a French country home.

5051640,4,B0072GPQNG,"On paper, this film must have appeared to be a tired contrivance-- so many cliches, so little to hold it together. Yet, somehow, after making films for 40 years, Spielberg continues to get better and better at what he does better than anybody else. One might say that the Spielberg film is a contradiction to the phrase ""they don't make them like they used to."" Well, Spielberg does-- and in some ways better than anybody ever has. That isn't to say a movie like War Horse is going to offer new insights into the human condition, but it does breathe new life into the hopeful, sugar coated miracle stuff that Hollywood lives and breathes on.

The images in this film are truly breathtaking. And, it should be said, they go beyond cliche and achieve poetry. It may be a kind of commercial poetry, but it is beautiful nonetheless. And though many of the situations feel fake (especially one with a sick child and her kindly grandfather), and some of the sequences just reek of manipulation, most of them work wonderfully. As much as I resisted, I teared up a couple of times. Cynics may disagree, but I think Spielberg has an extraordinary and authentic emotional sense-- and I choose to believe its genuine. The camera movement, the blocking-- the very conception of so many shots -- all function to communicate straight to the heart.

Just contrast the simple emotion in this film to a much more famous-- but much more fraudulent film-- Forest Gump. Both films, of course, are wonderfully executed pieces of cinema magic. But while both are fairy tales, and both play upon our desire for wishes to come true, there's a big difference. In this film (like most of Spielberg's movies), the simple emotion comes from basic truths. People make fools of themselves, horses (and farms) get lost to the boss man and to war. Hard work means a lot but it doesn't always produce the desired result. But sometimes, you get back what you lose. Life isn't random, but it does spin off many colors. In Forest Gump, on the other hand, the meek not only inherit the earth, they also get to own their own conglomerate! And not only that-- those who work the hardest for change are shown up as fools. Thus, Forest Gump turns out to be based on a Big Lie -- the lie that Reagan sold to America-- that brains and creative thinking-- and daring-- were the road to death (Jennie) or disfigurement (Dan). Of course we know now that Reagan and his Big Lie actually destroyed the middle class-- and ruined our country. But Big Business keeps propping up the Reagan brand since his laissez-faire narrative made them rich at everyone else's expense.

Spielberg's film, as mentioned before, is also a fairy tale. But it doesn't pretend (as does Forest Gump) to offer a new spin to a key decade in history. Gump is a travesty of the '60s-- and a slap in the face of real heroes like MLK and Robert Kennedy. War Horse's connection with WW1 is purely casual. This is not a film about a moment in time-- it is just a series of warm and fuzzy dreams that show us as we would like to be, and remind us that life is better when we are humble, kind, and a little brave. No-- we don't get Bubba Gump Shrimp company t-shirts or the Porsche that Bob Zemeckis probably drives around in. What we get-- and keep-- are our souls.

So-- don't go see War Horse expecting a serious work of art (unless you accept Damien Hirst's definition of art as ""anything done super well."") But do go if you want to experience Hollywood magic (for better or for worse) at its finest.",1334102400,2,3523,4.534591194968553

I can deal with a bit of the fluffy majikal crap just because it comes with the territory, but, let me put it this way, the existence of the unicorns in the movie ""Legend"" was more believable than a good portion of War Horse.

Positive:
Costumes.
Negatives: A few of the film fantasies.
(1.) The movie would have benefited from showing how challenging it is to train a wild animal even from an experienced trainer. The one trick scene of the human not showing predator eyes did not do training a horse any justice.
(2.) The first scenes showed a heavily stone strewn field for the horse to pull through which for a first time collar use would have bloodied the animal especially after 12+ straight hours. The stones would have broken the iron plow and probably injured the animal. The larger stones should have been picked out first. That's why the adjoining house and walls are made of stone.
(3.) The continual hand broadcasting of handfuls of turnip seeds into a small areas is wasteful and not why the furrows were created.
(4.) A son being shown his father's war medals for the first time at age 17 didn't make any sense. Father was simplistically portrayed as distant and cold.
(5.) The portrayal of the Germans, for the most part, as ruthless killers stretched credulity. Even the reversal of roles in saving the horse was too Hollywood - bolt cutters anyone.
(6.) The french farm girl, Emilie,  while farming was wearing a hair bow, makeup and a perfectly clean dress. The perfect English made her seem more actress than farm girl. That she had never ridden before yet gallops off across fields on her first try is not real. If she doesn't fall the horse would sense an inexperienced rider and throw her. Her death was a wasted storyline. As well as still  another horse auction with her grandfather showing up to bid what would have been a fortune. Just bizarre storytelling and movie editing.
(7.) The tank chasing after and projectiles exploding around Joey was just visual fictional cheapening of the animal. A director whose first priority is his own filming recognition.
(8.) Final scene of the horse and trainer just happening to be in the same medical staging area was far fetched. And, in his blinded condition, the trainer knew that the horse's markings were covered by mud. That Joey didn't approach his trainer in a natural horse-to-trainer manner didn't look right.
(9.) Presenting WWI as trenches, barbed wire and muddy landscape is as old as movies have been around. I've seen the same barbed wire and sand bags for the past 90 years. You would think there would be a lot more to that war. The movie ""Wings"" is one example.",1333929600,8,2668,4.7727272727272725

5051648,3,B0072GPQNG,"I am a sucker for sentimental animal movies so I would have been quite happy with a sappy tear jerker.  Also, having read the book which, although poorly written in general, was compelling in its war scenes, and considering the Academy Award nominations, I was anticipating watching War Horse with great enthusiasm.  However, I was disappointed.

On the plus side, I thought the film was lovely and technically very well done. The film was tastefully done with none of the gratuitous violence that plague movies today.  The animal training was brilliant and the animals were very well cared for according to numerous newspaper and magazine articles I read on the Internet.  Indeed, one of the horses who portrayed Joey most frequently was a failed race horse who has found a new calling as a successful movie star. By far, the horses were the best actors in this movie and they and the cinematography were the saving grace of the film.

Unfortunately, for me, the movie had more negatives than positives. From the beginning, the movie was boring and sterile.  I wanted to become involved in this film, but the acting lacked the emotion, intensity, and sincerity I needed to do so.  I felt like a spectator rather than a participant.  This was especially true in the relationship between Albert and Joey.  You can tell when a person genuinely loves animals and Jeremy Irvine didn't show that.  Where is Roddy McDowell when you need him?

The story line also seemed to lack continuity.  The two German brothers did not appear in the book and did little to move the plot forward in the movie.  The young French girl and her grandfather played a more prominent part in the book, but in the movie, their role was so minor it only added to the disjointed feel of the film.  It wasn't until the death of Topthorn that the movie gained continuity and I could become involved in the plot.  The scene in which the British and German soldiers worked together to free Joey was the most compelling part of the movie, but even in that scene the acting seemed forced and lacking in sincerity.  In general, the actors gave the impression they were merely reciting their lines rather than feeling them.  Where was the charisma?

All said, I would like to thank Mr. Spielberg for creating this tribute to the horses who served in the first World War.  Millions of horses and hundreds of thousands of dogs served and died in that most horrific of wars and they deserve to be remembered.",1333929600,4,2467,4.693023255813953

5051652,4,B0072GPQNG,"""War Horse"": Beautiful cinematography, excellent musical score, stunning production design, some great ""Spielberg""-type moments and a memorable performance by Joey (horse)...unfortunately, the script is dull, cliched and sometimes, down-right corny.

I thought the beginning was slow and the relationship, between the boy and Joey, wasn't developed strong enough for me to care of when they had to be separated.

I didn't think the film was interesting, until the war began. The war scenes were well shot and rather exciting (and a little surprisingly, more violent than I'd expect). There's a special moment, towards the end of the film, where in the midst of war, Joey is able to temporarily, hault the bloodshed of the two sides.

The exchanging of Joey's ""ownership"" throughout the film, in some cases, is kind of boring. It only really gets really sad, when with the Germans, near the end: There is a heartbreaking scene, involving another horse, that really makes you wish horses weren't really treated that way in wars.

As a Spielberg film, it's not one of his best. It has the look and sometimes, feel of an epic masterpeice, but the script\pacing is what holds it back. There are certainly, classic moments\images in the film, but it's not enough to forgive the dis-jointed narrative.

5051661,4,B0072GPQNG,"Belatedly, I am struggling my way through this year's Oscar batch. I always knew that I could not possibly support a horse story for best movie. I don't like horses. They don't like me. I don't know what came first.
Anyway, given these starting handicaps, I was amazingly moved by this piece of conventional mind candy. The cinematography is top notch, expectedly. The visual strength of some scenes overcomes my little inner man's protests: this is kitsch, man! He says without much conviction that he can make me listen.

Albert, a teen in Devon, raises a horse and they become best friends, on a struggling farm. Against all odds, the horse even agrees to pull the plough. Alas, dad drinks and needs to sell the horse to pay the rent. Horse ends up in English cavallery, then WW1 starts, the Brits attack a German position on horse back (outrageous idea), horse gets confiscated by the huns, stolen by a deserter, briefly repossessed by a French farmer's teen granddaughter, confiscated again by the huns, coerced into forced labor pulling artillery.
In the meantime, Albert has grown up and is a trench soldier. No more of the story now, to avoid spoliers.

The mightiest scene in the film is when the horse, running away in panic, after a cannon has hit near him, gets stuck in the barbed wire between the trenches; an English and a German soldier come out of their respective trenches and cut the horse free. Then they toss a coin for ownership. A stroke of genius in war romantics.",1333670400,2,1488,4.697318007662835
5051662,5,B0072GPQNG,"Rather than analyze this and thoroughly pick it apart piece by piece, I'll just say I thoroughly enjoyed it and leave it at that.

But I think the hours the horses had to stand around having these peculiar pink creatures fuss over them and get them to do things they didn't understand merits at least a mention in the credits of the name of the warhorse and his raven haired sidekick. After all, without them, there wouldn't have been a movie.",1333584000,3,443,4.469135802469136

This horse goes from 1 set of hands to another throughout this movie, and the movie follows the horse.  There was NO REAL EMOTIONAL INVESTMENT in any of the characters.  When the characters lose the horse it is kind of similar to seeing a kid led away from a pet they will not be going home with or being denied the candy bar they so desperately want - you understand they are hurt but you are not moved to cry with them.

This movie is interesting enough for one viewing, I THINK MOST WILL ENJOY IT - but I can't see myself wanting to watch this multiple times (as I do when a movie is really good).",1333584000,4,860,4.316770186335404
5051664,5,B0072GPQNG,"There are many detractors for this very long (146 minutes) film, complaining that it is too emotional, too melodramatic, too 'Lassie Come Home', to over the top as a tearjerker, too Steven Speilberg and John Williams, et cetera. Well, it has all those elements but depending on the emotional vulnerability of the viewer the film can easily become a catharsis during this period of time when very little makes sense and the need for positive input into matters of the heart has rarely been more keen. Not having seen the stage play based on the book of the same name by acclaimed children's writer Michael Morpurgo, adapted for stage by Nick Stafford, this viewer is at a disadvantage in judging the story alone as here it is enhanced by gorgeous cinematography and amazingly realistic battle scenes. Lee Hall and Richard Curtis created the screenplay and seem to have allowed a proscenium stage story to expand into the spaces a play can only describe, and Steven Spielberg has taken it from there.

The time of the story in set in Devon, England. To his wife Rose's (Emily Watson) dismay war injured and silenced farmer Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan)  buys a thoroughbred horse rather than a plough animal that might save their leased farm form landowner Lyons (David Thewlis), but when his teenaged son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) trains the horse and calls him Joey, the two becoming inseparable, Albert does indeed manage to train Joey how to plough fields. When his harvest fails due to rain, Ted has to sell Joey to an army captain (Tom Hiddleston) who takes the horse into the battlefields of World War I the British cavalry and he is shipped to France. After a disastrous offensive he is captured by the Germans and changes hands twice more before he is found, caught in the barbed wire in No Man's Land four years later and freed in a scene between a British soldier and a German soldier that is one of the most memorable scenes in the film. Joey is returned behind British lines where Albert, now a private, has been temporarily blinded by gas, but still recognizes his beloved Joey. However, as the Armistice is declared Joey is set to be auctioned off. The results of the final auction seals the fate of the extraordinary lad and horse relationship in a most touching way.

There are many, many cameo roles in the film that though brief are extremely well delivered: Niels Arestrup is the wise grandfather to the young Emilie (Celine Buckens) who rescues Joey for a while; Toby Kebbell is excellent as Geordie Soldier as is David Kross as the kind German soldier Gunther whose younger brother Friedrich (Nicolas Bro) he protects, and Hinnerk Sch&ouml;nemann shines as the German solder who helps rescue Joey from the barbed wire in No Man's Land. Leonard Carow, Matt Milne, Robert Emms, and Eddie Marsan are likewise memorable.

The breathtaking cinematography is by Janusz Kaminski and the at times lugubrious musical score is by longtime Spielberg associate, composer John Williams. The story aims for the heart and finds its mark - and there is nothing wrong with that.  Perhaps this film is much needed right now.  Grady Harp, April 12",1333584000,2,3144,4.812962962962963
5051665,1,B0072GPQNG,"I have to agree with nearly all of the one-star reviews. The plot reminded me of the Lassie series which were very entertaining.  Lassie is a super-dog much like Joey is a super-horse.  They each overcome terrible circumstances, avoid death, and eventually are reunited at home with their owners/guardians, in an emotional and heart-warming way. The filming was top-notch as one would expect from Spielberg, but the plot was on the lightweight side; the acting as far as it went was professional but could not save this movie. Also the overriding narration was very distracting and really defeated both the story and the acting where this technique was employed. It struck me that the director must have felt it was necessary to bolster a weak plot and perhaps keep the viewer awake during this very long, slow show. The movie also plays heavily on stereotypes which became a little boring, except for the scene near the end when a German soldier saw the plight of Joey entangled in the barbed wire and the inability of the British soldier to free Joey. The German comes out of his trench with a wire cutter, and his comrades watching all of this, throw out more wire cutters to facilitate getting Joey free. So, in my opinion, this movie had its moments, but overall, it was just one star.",1333584000,10,1290,4.728888888888889

5051667,5,B0072GPQNG,"It has taken me a long time to cozzen up to Speilberg. His early movies were schlock. Sound and fury signifying nothing. Close Encounters was a goofy con job with trashy leitmotives, gauze and blurry lighting. ET was more of the same with lots of cute kids. Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, in spite of theatric high marks for execution, were mindless homages to serialized kiddie junk from the 30s to the 50s.

Schindlers List turned that all around. It had substance. It put some of that cinemagraphic education to work in a frightenly grim look into the face of real horror. There have been other acheivments ( and flops ) since then.

I don't know the childs book basis. Usually literary transpositions wind up a drawback anyway. I do know literature, films, Ralph Vaughn-Williams and Delius. This movie pulls from period wells very effectively to create ambience.

There is a lot going on in the structure of the movie. At the heart of all the stories there is that mystic love of the horse. Few movies have captured that as well as Black Stallion. Warhorse has done that for me. The animals in this movie are amazingly engaged in the tale.

The pace is gentile, nostalgic and manages to try to see hope and love in tragic circumstances of a horrible war.  Perhaps that is melodramatic. Perhaps it is too optimistic to see things come out right in the end; with so many characters chosing to make honorable and loving decisions.

The story here avoids the overwhelming brutality of Schindler's or Private Ryan. The vignettes dealt with violence in a corner of the eye manner. The cavalry charge sequence of the first battle ends in a blaze of machine guns that manages to wreck bloodless slaughter guaranteed to not upset the customers. Two German child soldiers make an impulsive attempt to desert the war on the captured stallions and are caught. Their sad execution is handled discretely. There are the French Grandfather and granddaughter struggling to survive too close to the war, who recover the stallions only to see the arrival of revenous foraging enemies taking all away from them.

The tale comes to a climax when survivors meet in the last half hour of the film. Keep a hankie (s) at the ready as you will repeatedly need them.

It's a beautifully crafted film. Hat's off to everyone involved in the project. As with too many Speilberg projects you wind up having to suspend some judgement. How this horse manages to survive nearly four years of war when everyting around him dies is utter nonsense. It's still Indiana Jones and Star Wars schtick.

But there is a lifetime of craft conjoined to this formula. My skepticism has been conquered.

5051668,1,B0072GPQNG,"I had high hopes for this film, especially since Steven Spielberg made it. Unfortunately this is his worst film. From start to finish it is a failure. If we split it into three parts, the beginning is boring, the ending is sappy, and as for the middle, there is no plot, no story. Half way through the film it mentions the brave carrier messenger pigeons used in WWI to delivery military secrets, and I was hoping that Spielberg had finally stumbled onto a good story. Following the plight of the pigeons would have at least made this a film with a story. If Spielberg was trying to make a great World War One film, he produced a monumental failure. If he was attempting to make a great film about a man and his horse, he missed the mark completely. Indeed, if you want a great film about WWI and horses, then get the true action film from 1985: The Lighthorsemen. As for me, I will no longer buy a Spielberg film just because his name is on it.

Joey endures various hardships but endures through it all, inspiring those around him to greater things.

The baby horse is a beautiful animal and watching the equine run through the fields soon becomes Albert's new hobby. The day comes when the horse is taken to auction. Albert's father, Ted (Peter Mullan) comes to market to buy a plow horse, but when he sees the magnificent beast and spots his landlord smirking on the other side of the fence he ends up paying a small fortune to purchase the animal. Albert names the horse Joey and sets to training the animal. When the landlord threatens to take the family farm, Albert trains the animal to wear a horse collar and plow a field. However, when a destructive storm ruins the family's turnip crop, Ted is forced to sell the horse to the British cavalry for the war that has just been declared (1914). The animal is purchased by Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) who promises Albert that Joey will be his personal mount and he will return the horse to him after the war. It's off to France and after a foolish offensive Joey loses his mount and is captured by the Germans. What follows is an extraordinary journey for Joey as he changes hands from one owner to the next. The horse has a remarkable spirit of determination and raises to every challenge that comes before it. Meanwhile, Albert has joined the Army and is fighting on the Western front and carries with him an illustration of Joey. He's convinced they will find each other again.

WAR HORSE is an impressive movie. Visually, the film is a cinematic kaleidoscope of stunning wonder. It's like watching a Terrence Malick film, but with an actual story and lots of action.

The main character in the story is Joey, so if you don't like horses, you might not like the film. However, the human actors all do a fine job. Some of them are only on screen for a few minutes in a couple of scenes, but each of them excellently portrays the emotional depth of their characters. There are some who might say that the movie is filled with characterizations and no real acting, but this isn't the case. Most of the acting in the movie isn't done in broad gestures and over articulation. Instead, the real acting happens in the small moments: the way the eyes light up, the gentle turn of the head, etc. For instance, there is a scene where a German regiment invades a small farm and takes everything away from the farmer and his granddaughter who live there. There really isn't much action that happens in this scene and there aren't many words. However, volumes are spoken between the characters in how they say things and in the little things they do. WAR HORSE is filled with scenes like that.

Even if you aren't a horse or animal person, you can take a lot away from WAR HORSE. Though a horse is the main and title character, the movie is really about hope, perseverance, and determination. It is a story about the deep friendship between two kindred spirits. It's an ancient story that's been told again and again throughout history (the Biblical story of Joseph, ODYSSEY, THE AENIED, E.T., etc.). It's a story that resonates because it touches something deep within each of us. It's a grand old story, but in WAR HORSE it's just told through the eyes of a horse and his boy.",1333324800,3,3307,4.592216582064298
5051680,4,B0072GPQNG,"""War Horse""  is Steven Spielberg's adaptation of the novel by Michael Morpurgo and the Tony Award-winning play.  Set in rural England and Europe during World War I, it's the story of a horse, Joey, and young Albert (Jeremy Irvine), who tames and trains him to plow the fields of his family's modest farm.  When the army wants horses for the war effort, Joey and Albert are parted and we follow Joey's adventures on the front, in battle, and undergoing the horrors of modern warfare.  Joey encounters a British cavalry officer, German soldiers, and a French farmer and his granddaughter before an emotional climax.

Spielberg has given ""War Horse"" great spectacle.  The war scenes are realistic and harrowing in their brutality.  That horses were used at all when machine guns could mow down a brigade of charging cavalry in seconds is testament to the thoughtless cruelty of war.

The four-disc Combo Pack contains Blu-ray and DVD versions, a 60-minute making-of documentary, behind-the-scenes looks at sound recording and editing, stills gallery, and a profile of one of the many extras brought in for the movie that details how ""atmosphere people"" are cast and why they are essential to a film's believability.",1333238400,4,1212,5.055276381909548

This was a movie I was actually looking forward to mainly because it was a Spielberg movie. I really did end up liking it quite a bit. The movie reminded me of ""Australia"" in the way that it felt like two movies. The first half was the bonding of the boy and his horse and the second an action filled war movie. I really enjoyed that and it made it feel shorter then it was. For those worried about this being like ""In Pursuit Of Honor"" I have to say that there is really no horse abuse in this at all so it's OK to watch this. Much like any Spielberg movie it is very entertaining and classy, but for me at least this is a one time watch. Overall, a very good movie that is very much worth seeing.

5051683,1,B0072GPQNG,"This movie was laughable. Every single performance was over-acted, hyper-melodramatic, and cheesy in the worst sense. I half expected the horses and main characters to break out into song like some animated Disney children's film. In fact had this movie been an animated Disney musical it would have improved the watch-ability by lightyears. If you want a cartoony, horse themed travesty of a WWI drama then by all means enjoy, but for anyone hoping to see a serious period piece or thoughtful war drama, beware... it's a joke. It's just a goofy story about a farm boy (who curdles milk with an accent akin to Samwise Gamgee from LOTR) whose pet horse gets sent off to be a service beast in WWI, making unlikely horsey friends, and other equally one dimensional human characters, along the way back to his boy. I spent most of the movie trying not to laugh out loud at the absurdness of it all. Should have spared us all the agonizing 2 and a half hours and shipped Ol' Joey off to the glue factory in the first 20 minutes.

5051684,5,B0072GPQNG,"I just saw this movie last night.  It was a very fine movie.  It tells the story of a thoroughbred horse who never really was able to live his life as a thoroughbred horse should.  Instead of racing he was made to plow fields.  Instead of living a life with other thoroughbreds, he gets shipped off to the horrors of World War One.  But joey, the horse, is a survivor and a leader.  He is quick to learn how to plow a field and then is quick to learn how to perform in a cavalry charge in the face of machine guns.  He then shows the other horses how to pull artillery through muddy fields.  The only thing this horse never learns is how to jump.

The inability to jump leads the horse to become entangled in barbed wire which then leads to a rather unlikely peaceful meeting between a British and a German soldier as they try to untangle Joey.  They are successful and Joey somehow avoids the mercy bullet of the matter-of-fact sergeant.  But the entire movie shows how Joey's most remarkable character trait consistently reappears, his ability to win over the admiration of those around him.

Joey first won the respect of Ted, a farmer and former soldier of earlier conflicts.  He then won over Albert, Ted's son.  In succession Joey wins the love of a cavalry officer, a German deserter, a young local girl, another war horse, another German soldier, and eventually two opposing armies in the field.  Through it all he wins the hearts of everyone in the movie theater.

Steven Spielberg did his usual fine job of directing a cast of newcomers and no-names to create a film worthy of Best Picture nomination.  It did not win the Academy Award, but it is still an excellent movie well worth the time it takes to watch it.  It shows the horros of World War One and how an animal can be the main character of a major motion picture.  In a sense, Joey, or rather the many horses who played him, should have been nominated for Best Actor because this horse is reason enough alone to go see this movie.",1332633600,12,1999,4.427397260273972

5051686,5,B0072GPQNG,"S.Spielberg gold. He took a long-loved youth's book written in 1982, and transformed it into a film so beautiful it reminded me of the English Countryside painter Thomas Gainsborough 18th century. Having been educated to teach visual art, I was captivated with the continual perfection of composition of very scene, seemingly every frame. I am an avid British film/TV viewer, but `War Horse' cinematography meets the highest of anything I have seen to date. The period sets, scenery, and costuming are perfection transforming the viewer into a time capsule of 1914 to the end of WWI. Stunning aesthetic mastery.

Janusz Kaminski must get some credit with Spielberg for the cinematography perfection.

I did read the book first and was confident (viewing the film proved me correct) that Spielberg would be true to the book. It's about as close as a film can get to a book. Being a shorter book, written for ages 11-13 originally, and the movie length (146 min) helped provide all of the needed key points of the story of the amazing red bay Joey. One could say plenty about the fine acting but it is the story, and the compelling adventures of the horse, told through the view-point of Joey (akin to Black Beauty) that makes this a must see, and once available, for me will be a MUST OWN.

The viewer literally rides through all kinds of situations, some heart wrenching, some heart stopping, some heart breaking, some heartache, while others end heart warming. Is it the horse that has all the heart and pours out from the screen; or is it the mastery of another Steven Spielberg directing/producing production that makes your pulse rise and fall in alarming changes? This is the first film in many a year that actually left me on the brink of tears. The end was so stunning that my wife and I could not move, could not get up and leave during the credits, and that was a plus since the credits footage contain some beautiful music that revives one's spirit after such an experience.

Yes, there is warfare, and from WWI books and photos I have seen, and a grandfather's eyewitness accounting, the film shows the war accurately. But even the battles were so beautifully filmed. Hats off to anyone on the film involved in the actual work of producing the visual aspect of `War Horse.'",1332201600,10,2284,4.731155778894473

5051689,5,B0072GPQNG,"Steven Spielberg is a grade above most contemporary directors because he keeps his priorities right, on the story and relationships. I hardly ever see movies in theaters today because most of them are crass and confusingly edited. This movie's cinematography (by Janusz Kaminski) is rich and creative, and close-ups are used effectively to help you bond with the characters. John Williams' music is once again enriching. It is a movie about the adventures of a horse in World War I, but it's even more about the struggle to adapt and maintain stable relationships in war. The horse is, for some of the characters, their closest companion. Kind of like ""Sarah, Plain and Tall: Winter's End"", War Horse's theme is about the need to build relationships as the fragility of life is impressed upon us. In fact, at one point, the horse brings together the opposing sides in friendship in the ""no man's land"" between the trenches, reminiscent of the widespread real-life Christmas Truce which occurred in 1914. Another thing that impresses me is the way it shows violence. There's no blood on the whole movie that I saw, and powerful emotions of fear and relief are created through making you feel attached to the characters, not through graphic violence. As a John Ford aficionado, I could see Ford's influence in Spielberg's storytelling, with the camera angle and position sometimes depicting an emotional closeness with the land and an ending told without words, like the end of Ford's movie The Searchers. It left me with a wonderful feeling at the end of satisfaction and peace. Way to go, Steven Spielberg!",1331856000,8,1606,4.973977695167286
5051690,5,B0072GPQNG,"Just as Spielberg released both Jurassic Park and Schindler's List in the year of our lord, 1993, so too has he released The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse within a few weeks of each other in 2011.  To quote another film, perhaps he is ""trying to suggest something about the duality of man,"" and that man is Spielberg himself.  War Horse is destined to become an essential entry into Spielberg's oeuvre, a sumptuous piece of filmmaking that forms part of a conversation between Spielberg and the epics from Hollywood's golden age.  If the film has a central protagonist, then it is Joey, the stallion who makes his way from pastoral England to the war torn continent.  As the film begins, Ted Narracott, a well meaning drunkard, is searching for a suitable horse to plow an arid but rock filled plot of land.  He travels into town with the intention of bidding on a solid work horse, but a little too much drink and a betting match between Ted and his seedy landlord leads him to buy a young stallion, a horse that, as his friends note, is completely unsuitable for the grueling work of plowing a field.

 When Ted returns home to his wife, she, quite understandably, becomes upset and tells her husband he will have to return the horse immediately.  Ted's son, Albert, becomes taken with the horse and convinces his parents that he will be able to train the horse to take a harness and pull a plow.  As Albert trains his horse, Joey, the two of them form a bond.  Spielberg gets plenty of drama out of the nearly wordless communication necessary to teach Joey to eat out of a bucket, to stay or come on command, or to remain still as Albert fits a harness over his head.  Of course, Spielberg has a distinct knack for communicating sans words.  My guess is that if one were to watch War Horse with the sound off, it wouldn't take much to follow the ups and downs of the story.  Albert does manage to get Joey to plow the once useless plot, if only after the ground has been softened by the English rain.  But this doesn't end the hardships of the Narracotts.  Shortly after planting their crops, a thunderstorm upends their crops, and Ted must find some way to make the rent.  World War I has just broken out, and he decides to lease Joey to the English army.  Joey will be returned, if he survives.

 From here, Joey makes his way from owner to owner, crisscrossing a war ravaged Europe.  He begins in the care of an English officer, but ends up in the hands of two underage German brothers, a young French girl and her grandfather, and a German caretaker.  For a film that borrows so heavily from traditional Hollywood cinema, War Horse has a plenty of experimental elements.  And while Joey serves as a constant, each new set of characters he encounters function as a kind of vignette, as if Spielberg had connected several short films into a full length.  These vignettes allow the film to get away from the protagonist versus antagonist narrative found in most war films.  Because Joey traverses borders, our sympathies lie not with nation-states, the English versus the Germans, but with individual characters.  If there is a villain in the film, then it is the war itself.  This structure seems especially suited to WWI, perhaps one of the most singularly idiotic wars ever waged.

 Spielberg is borrowing heavily from the epics of the mid-twentieth century.  There's plenty of John Ford, Akira Kurosawa, Mikhail Kalatozishvili, David Lean, and early Stanley Kubrick in the DNA of War Horse.  He takes from these artists a painter's sense of how to fill up a canvas.  Here Spielberg is painting every little corner of the screen, to the extent where seeing the film in your living room is a completely different experience from viewing the film on the big screen.  Perhaps one of the most interesting choices in the film is the decision to obscure most of the violence when portraying one of the world's goriest wars.  This is an especially intriguing decision when you consider that Spielberg taught an entire generation how to recreate military violence in Saving Private Ryan.  And yet, just as many people were enraptured by Ryan's violence as were repulsed.  One particular scene in War Horse is arguably a more effective representation of violence than all of Ryan's gobs of blood.  In what is most likely a scene influenced by Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin, Spielberg cuts back and forth between images of English cavalry charging, German machine guns firing, and a slew of riderless horses.  The audience can easily fill in what occurs between each cut, perhaps more effectively than any filmmaker could.

 In War Horse we have a perfect coalition between Spielberg the craftsman and Spielberg the student of film.  Watching War Horse it becomes evident why the 1970s were the golden years of American cinema.  These directors were formally trained in film school where they were introduced to criticism that dissected the classics.  These directors didn't watch movies; they studied them.  And yet the movie isn't just fodder for film buffs to pick apart.  Any casual fan of Spielberg's work will find plenty of affecting moments in War Horse.  I saw the film over the holidays with my family, and at the conclusion of the movie, my mother turned to me and, rebuffing common assumptions, said, ""He made it like they used to.""  She's absolutely right, in a way.  This is a film that looks to the past for inspiration, but at the same time it cannot be mistaken for the work of anyone other than Spielberg himself.",1331424000,7,5543,4.720083246618106
5051691,5,B0072GPQNG,"Steven Spielberg's War Horse misses the boat to being a masterpiece by about 70 years. It's easy to imagine it being a John Ford film or, because of the way Spielberg treats each frame like a canvas, perhaps a film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The use of color, the story, and even the score hearken back to Old Hollywood, but the story has all the elements of a Hallmark film and that's what ultimately restrains it. The story, while epic in scope, is nothing we haven't seen before. In fact, we've seen it done thousands of times. If released in the 1940s, War Horse would be hailed as a masterpiece. Now, it's just an extraordinarily well-made film with familiar story arcs and motifs; an idealistic fairy tale set during WWI that is crowd-pleasing, uplifting, sentimental, and sappy. The heavy drama is kept contained, let loose just enough to tug at the heartstrings of the audience. This could have been a failure of unfathomable proportions, but Spielberg is too talented a filmmaker to allow that. Here, he's made an old-fashioned tearjerker that works incredibly despite reeking of familiarity.

Based on a children's book by Michael Morpurgo, the film is essentially told from the perspective of Joey, the thoroughbred horse of the title. Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), a farmer, buys the horse at an auction for 30 guineas, intending to use him as a plough horse. His decision also stems from spite, as his landlord Lyons (David Thewlis) attempted to outbid him on the horse. Now, Ted is unable to pay rent to Lyons. Ted's son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) names the horse Joey and begins training it for the plough. Soon, with WWI looming and in imminent danger of losing their farm, Ted sells Joey to a young soldier, with Albert promising the horse that they will see each other again. The film follows Joey as he drifts from owner to owner, separated from each new one by the tragedies of war. The people who inherit him are the kind-hearted stock characters you expect to find in such a blood-soaked timeframe.

Alas, sometimes breaking new ground is not necessary in telling a good, albeit familiar story. Be aware that War Horse is quite heavy on the sap, going for easy emotional sentiment that has worked with audiences consistently for years. It takes no risks, does nothing we haven't seen before; but even at its most eye-rolling, generic moments it comes together wonderfully. At nearly 2 hours, it moves quickly and the stock characters give you something to immediately latch onto. Furthermore, while it's rooted heavily in drama, there are some intensely exciting (horse-related) sequences. The scene where Joey gallops through a warzone, ending up trapped in no-man's land may be one of the most thrilling sequences Spielberg has ever filmed.

It really is too strong an achievement to dismiss. Predictable it may be, even with that needless, last-minute dramatic conflict, it's a hard film not to enjoy. While the cynic in me tried to fight it, the film did bring me close to tears and I have to applaud Spielberg for trying to tell these classic, cinematic stories while maintaining the feel of them. Some will complain that the film is too generic; expecting more from Spielberg, but it also may become one of those family-friendly movies that achieve ""classic status"" among suburban America. It's great entertainment, exquisitely made and nostalgic. While it follows a predictable path, War Horse has plenty of heart and feels commandeered from a long-gone era of films and filmmaking. For this, I both admire and respect it. In many ways, it's one of the most congenial films of 2011.

5051692,3,B0072GPQNG,"War Horse is by no means a bad movie. It was well acted, well scripted, and in many ways a deeply moving film. But if you are a horse lover (as I am) it will likely be difficult for you to watch.

The movie follows a beautiful Thoroughbred named Joey through various phases of his life. Unfortunately, the horse has a very difficult life, changing owners numerous times and going through some really harrowing experiences. I thought perhaps some of the ugliness of war would be toned down since this movie will likely appeal to a wide audience especially because of how the ads play up the bond between the horse and the boy. While there's not a lot of blood and gore, it is still very violent and it is very much a movie about war.

I could not adequately express my issues with this movie without discussing a couple of scenes within the movie, although I have tried very hard to leave out any major spoilers.  If you would like to know what kinds of scenes made this difficult for me to watch, read on (*Mild spoiler alert*):

One of the first war scenes depicts a cavalry battalion (with Joey being towards the front) ambushing a group of unsuspecting soldiers. A group of 100+ soldiers on horses rush toward the encampment and cut down several soldiers, some of them in the process of shaving and getting dressed. But there are machine guns hidden in the trees and almost the entire battalion of horses and riders is cut down by machine gun fire as they head towards the trees. Only a few horses (Joey included) survive. This was a very difficult scene to watch and countless dead horses on the ground gave you an idea of how badly horses generally fared in wartime situations.

There is another very difficult scene to watch in which Joey is running away from a tank and runs in a blind panic over and around several bunkers.  He eventually runs head long through several strands of barbwire. He gets so bogged down in the barbwire that he flips end over end and is completely unable to free himself. It was heartwrenching and terrible to watch. However, the scene that follows was one of the most moving of the movie (I'll leave out the details).

One of the tired, but true, war adages that came to mind while watching this movie was ""war is hell."" This proves to be true for pretty much everyone in the movie, especially the horse. While this was a good movie in some respects, it is definitely not one I enjoyed watching.  I hope this review helps others like me who may not enjoy watching a horse endure the ravages of war.",1331164800,98,2534,4.46969696969697
5051693,4,B0072GPQNG,"Most of us have read about dogs that after a distant separation from their human families, find their way back home. There are also cinematic versions. I recall ""Homeward Bound: An Incredible Journey"", and a Lassie film from the 1940's and I think Rin-Tin-Tin; but that might have been TV. In any case, director Steven Spielberg ups the ante, this time with a horse named Joey.

An English farmer, out of spite for his landlord (David Thewlis), buys a young horse at an auction. He needed a larger horse for purposes of plowing but was a wee bit tipsy at the time. The son, Albert (Jeremy Irvine) raises the horse that is unusually smart, strong and sociable. Eventually, in need of cash, the father (Peter Mullan) sells the horse to a young army officer (Tom Hiddleston) at the dawn of World War I. Spielberg then sets events in motion that follow Joey and his fellow horse through numerous battles, arduous labor, escapes and engagements with English and German armies and French farmers. Aided by longtime partner, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg paints a beautiful portrait of landscapes, sunrises and sunsets.

The film does stretch believability at times. Would a horse volunteer for duty to pull a canon up a hill in place of a fellow horse? It also would have made more sense to have Germans speak German and French speak French but I guess subtitles over even small sections of film would scare off some audiences. This is old fashion movie making and even with some bleak battle scenes and animal mistreatment, will attract families. Sure it's sentimental and even cheesy at times, but it has a strong moral foundation and it ultimately uplifting.

The Blu ray disc is of course a 1080p conversion.  It has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio which makes the spectacular cinematography really shine.  The audio comes in the form of DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 24 bit surround, so those with a serious home theater system will be rewarded.",1331164800,4,1941,4.8343373493975905

5051695,3,B0072GPQNG,"Based on a book by Michael Morpurgo and adapted by two Oscar-nominated writers Lee Hall (""Billy Elliot"") and Richard Curtis (""Four Weddings and a Funeral""), Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" has a lot of great footage in it. Every scene is beautifully shot and most actors deliver solid performances. Battle scenes are fierce. The no man's land scene is poignant and even humorous. All these sequences are fine, showing what Spielberg can do. However, as a whole, ""War Horse"" just doesn't work well.

It is a story of a thoroughbred named Joey and a young boy Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) living in Devon, England. When the World War I breaks out, Joey is sent across the Channel with British soldiers to the battlefield. Albert, still too young to enlist the army, vows that he will find Joey no matter what it takes.

It is an uplifting story, I admit, but some part of the filmed adaptation just doesn't convince. Why does Mr. Narracott (Peter Mullan) insist on purchasing Joey, a thoroughbred, when he knows this is not a good idea to plough for his farm? Why does the French grandfather let his granddaughter ride the horse alone on the hill when he should know it is still wartime?

All these things would not be a big problem if the story is told from Joey's viewpoint, but on a big screen, they serve to no purpose but to further the story, which becomes very sentimental. Spielberg is after all a master of audience manipulation (and I don't think it's a bad thing), but compared with his past works like ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,"" his hand to manipulate is too conspicuous here.

Finally, the film is basically a war movie and includes a combat scene. Unlike his ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the mass carnage of World War I is toned down, but I am not sure ""War Horse"" should be called a family picture. ""War Horse"" is certainly a touching film, but that is partly because there are so many who are not as lucky as the film's heroes.",1330992000,3,1942,4.636627906976744
5051696,4,B0072GPQNG,"Trailers for ""War Horse"" reminded me that I hadn't seen anything of Spielberg's in a while, lately. He had taken some time off, I suppose, and he had returned this year with two films, the animated ""Adventures of Tintin"" (which I had no interest in seeing), and ""War Horse"", an adaptation of a British stage show, which had just come to Broadway. Admittedly, ""War Horse"" is not my kind of film, yet, when a film is made correctly, it doesn't have to be one's cup of tea for that person to thoroughly enjoy it.

""War Horse"" is overstuffed with emotion and pathos, sweeping beautiful landscapes, and a narrative that is pieced together in an interestingly non-traditional way, considering how old-fashioned it is, as a whole. Almost everything about this film is old fashioned, throwing back to a different generation of filmmaking that our generation had seemingly forgotten how to do. A film like this hasn't been done in a while, which made the overall tone kind of refreshing in a weird way.

""War Horse"" is the story of a boy and his pet horse. It is set in pre World War I Britain, and follows the horse as he is sold to be in the war, and the question is ""will he ever make it home again?"" The film follows the beautiful thoroughbred and for an animal character, we learn a lot about him over the course of the film. He reminds the men in the war of their humanity, and moves the hearts of everybody.

The film is almost sickeningly wholesome, but it's going for the heartwarming, tearjerker effect, and it for the most part, nails it. Spielberg can make anything work, and here is why. This film is not my cup of tea. I don't particularly care for war films that aren't crazily unrealistic (ex. ""Inglourious Basterds"" as one that I adored), and depict the setting realistically - but this isn't really a war film at all. While hundreds of men are dying in this war, the horse is symbolic. He reminds them that some things in the world are not hopeless, and there may be a better day to come.

While John William's beautiful score and the obvious attention to imagery that is played certainly help, the film doesn't have any big-name actors to back it up - but it doesn't need them. It also is about 30 minutes too long. I understand it wanted to achieve what is thought of as ""epic"" length (146 minutes), but I can think easily of four scenes off the top of my head that dragged the plot along longer than it should have. In a lot of ways, the double-narrative following two stories that eventually DO come together in the end is gimmicky and done-before, but I was able to forgive it being slightly contrived, because the final product is quite nice.

In the end, some parts of this movie are emotionally brutal and difficult to watch, but it has a very nice and beautiful ending that redeems it. While I wouldn't call this a ""must see"" kind of movie, it was a very nice way to spend a few hours in the dead of winter. Don't forget the tissues, though.

The horse is sold off during WWI and embarks on a journey through several owners, making an impact on everyone who encounters him. The question in everyone's mind is ""will the horse be reunited with his original owner?"" I will let the viewer discover the answer to that burning question while seeing the movie. As for the film itself, it is classic Spielberg; a heartwarming storyline, visually spectacular, and a well-told tale. The Schmaltz is turned on a bit here, but the movie's strengths, particularly the realistic war scenes, far outweigh its weaknesses. This is another fine effort from Hollywood's greatest director.",1330473600,10,698,5.025862068965517
5051699,5,B0072GPQNG,"More recently  as Steven Spielberg has become a more active producer, his directing credits are becoming less common.

In 2011 he produced the brillant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-8/dp/B004EPYZPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super 8</a>, one of my favorites, directed by JJ Abrams, the creator, writer and occasional director of Lost, and the recent Star trek. Super 8 is a great nostalgia piece evoking the early eighties, a movie within a movie, and an homage to Spielberg's earliest movies. Spielberg also produced Cowboys and Aliens, a somewhat weird meshing of two genres.

Now with Warhorse Spielberg directs, and shows his masterful touches throughout. In fact, if you are like me you can see traces of many great movies of the past. The early portions of the movies showing English countryside scenes, and the musical soundtrack of John Williams are reminiscent of John Ford's The Quiet Man. Trench warfare scenes are reminiscent of that all time classic All Quiet on the Western Front. Incidents relating to deserting soldiers are thematically reminiscent of Kubrick's Paths of Glory.

War, as bad as it is, somehow seems worse when an innocent animal is involved, which ultimately makes Warhorse the ultimate anti war polemic. And we have a love story between a young boy Albert, and a horse named Joey. As the movie begins we see the horse being born.

Later Albert's alcoholic father instead of buying a proper plough horse, foolishly pits himself agaainst his own landlord in bidding for the flash horse Joey, instead of a huge Clydesdale, making his tenancy precarious, and imperiling his families limited fortunes. Joey faces many trials and tribulations adjusting to the plough. Here we have a wonderful perforamnce from Emily Watson as the mother, cruelly snubbed during awards season.

When the war happens the father impulsively sells the horse to the military, despite Albert's protests. Albert, understandably distressed, too young to join the military, vows to be reunited with Joey. Meanwhile Joey goes to the front, and we have a poignant scene with his new owner. He and another horse escape the war briefly, and are adopted by a teenage girl. It's not long before the war interferes again, and Joey has a series of adventures.

My favorite scene is when he gets trapped in No Mans land, and both sides have to cooperate to free him. I loved the wire clippers flying scene. I also loved the sub story about the two young German brothers, and the parallel structure about how the British deal with a similar situation.

Ultimately the horse is a silent witness to the horror of war, becoming an effective storytelling metaphor.

Later in the movie one scene I thought was a little overdone, the moment of blindfold recognition. I like to feel emotions in a movie, but not to have them evoked in a contrived way.

Warhorse certainly deserves to be nominated for Best Picture and Best Cinematography, yet I cannot help thinking that actors who vote for awards would prefer as I do to have the story centered around a human character. Nevetheless, when I was a child or young teen I loved watching movies like this, particularly Lassie Goes to war.

Another movie I recommend if you don't mind subtitles is the French movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Very-Long-Engagement-English-Subtitled/dp/B000P3GFYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Very Long Engagement (English Subtitled)</a>, starring Audrey Tautou, and Academy Award winner Marion Cotillard. A girl seeks her boyfriend believed killed by being sent over the trench deliberately into no mans land for breaking military regulations. It has huge parallels with Warhorse except the protagonists are human, and also operates as a polemic. A beautifully filmed touching love story set against the war.

5051702,5,B0072GPQNG,"Once in a while, a truly magnificent movie comes along. This is one of them. Like any great Spielberg film, War Horse is a roller coaster ride that will take its viewers from one end of the emotional spectrum to the other. Just like E.T. and Saving Private Ryan, this movie has the ability to make you laugh one minute and then put a lump in your throat the next. The imagery, musical score, and cinematography are second to none.
If you own a horse or love horses, this movie may be difficult to watch at times because it can be quite stirring. As difficult as some scenes are to sit through though, I'm grateful for them and their ability to expose the cruelty that mankind has inflicted on horses. In many ways, this movie seems to honor the contributions of the horse and the contributions of our soldiers. Best of all, it is one of the few movies that actually appreciates horses and portrays them as something other than veterans of the race track. The only other movies I can recall that attempt to accomplish this are The Black Stallion, Black Beauty, and Gallant Bess.
War Horse does an excellent job of exposing the many horrors of war that the soldiers and horses both faced. It has all the unique elements of World War I such as no mans land, poison gas, tanks, and machine guns. All of which were a novelty before World War I. Historically, this movie seems to be very accurate. Interestingly, this movie doesn't take sides in the war.  Through the eyes of Joey, we see humanity and cruelty in both alliances of the war, the Allies and the Central Powers.
Kudos, Mr. Spielberg for doing your homework, putting your heart into this endeavor, and delivering an exceptional movie!  This film does what all good movies should.  It gives us characters to care about, an involving story, it shows us a time and place that's hard to imagine, and it stirs something inside of us.  This is one of only three movies I've watched in the theater that received a standing ovation after its conclusion.
I would like to mention that I have indeed seen this film (three times) and although I do not own the blu-ray yet, I did pre-order it the first day Amazon began accepting pre-orders.  With that being said, I can't honestly comment on the extra features or menus that will be released on the disc.

OK, I have now seen this movie. My wife refused as she is emotionally attached to horses as she used to show them. I felt bad after this movie mostly because of the way these animals were treated at that war. I suppose the ending was a happy one (spoiler alert). But the scenes were to graphic for me. Human carnage i can tolerate but not animals. Besides the above comment, the movie was exceptional and typical Spielberg, excellent production, maybe to excellent.

5051704,4,B0072GPQNG,"The courage of a horse and its bond with a young man amid the horrors of war serves as the backdrop to a saga of loyalty and survival in Warhorse, Steven Spielberg's take on World War I and its effect on a British family.  Adapted from a novel and inspired by the stage play of the same name, this is old fashioned filmmaking that could have easily been made 50 years ago back when epic war dramas like Lawrence of Arabia and Dr. Zhivago ruled the screens.

A teenage boy, Albert (Jeremy Irvine), and a colt, Joey, form a bond amid the English countryside. Albert's mother (Emily Watson) worries over the house being repossessed as his father (Peter Mullan), an alcoholic and war veteran, struggles to harvest crops from the harsh land.  Threatened with eviction, Joey is sold to the army to assist in the fighting in Europe during World War I.  Heartbroken, Albert vows to find Joey and be reunited.  We can see early on that Joey is a special horse who is smart and brave whether he submits to being a plow horse, outracing a motor car, or lugging German war machines up a mountain.  As the years pass from 1914-1918 and the war amasses its destructive toll on men and animals on both sides, Joey's ownership changes hands, but through it all, he finds a succession of kind souls to watch over him.  When Albert joins the battle, an unlikely series of events will bring him closer to Joey.

 Joey is an allegory to slavery as he is being sold as a commodity to hard labor and taken as property by either side in the war.  The story is primarily told through his eyes, and each set of people Joey encounters has a personal story: the British officer who makes a promise to bring Joey back to his rightful owner, a young German soldier who dotes protectively over his brother, or a German farm girl who is cared for by her grandfather. In wartime, making friends and losing them is a way of life, and Joey is no different whether it is a human or fellow mare.  Some common themes emerge from all these people, namely their affection for Joey and the toll that war exacts on loved ones.

Production values are superior especially the vivid cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who employs color schemes especially at the end that emulate the palettes of Gone with the Wind.  Irvine is ideally cast as the son who refuses to give up on his horse and friend.

There are not a lot of the trademark Spielberg moments that you expect; Clint Eastwood could have been the director without much difference.  There are memorable scenes that resonate including a tragic charge by British cavalry on a German position and an auction with an army `band of brothers' pitching in for a worthy cause.  Then there is the harrowing, desperate escape by Joey that culminates in him getting tangled in barbed wire in No Man's Land and help coming from an unlikely source which results in a most unusual standoff.  Such scenes may seem clich&eacute;d but register nonetheless.

The ending does have an emotional payoff, but there are some missed opportunities along the way.  There are relationships that could have been developed more like Albert's father who is a one dimensional character but has suffered trauma from a previous war.  The possibility of romance for Albert during a race between Joey and a car carrying a pretty girl never develops.  Spielberg also meant this as an antiwar film as in the scenes of brutal trench warfare where Albert witnesses his own comrades die, but such scenes are relatively brief and do not linger like his World War II saga, Saving Private Ryan.

Warhorse is about the bringing together of a family torn apart by war.  It's about the common humanity that unites strangers. It's also about a boy turned man and his love for his horse.",1330041600,133,3752,4.617469879518072

However, when the movie came out I went to see it in the theater and the movie was a different story.

The movie is both powerful and emotional. It opens with the birth of a colt and then the story develops into a strong bond between the horse (Joey) and his owner (Albert). You can not help but empathize with the horse and what he goes through as a war horse.  There are few painful moments in the movie where you could actually feel Joey's pain and suffering. Joey is reunited with his owner at the end of the movie which gives the movie its happy ending.

The movie is a must see for anybody who loves animals in general and horses in particular will enjoy ""War Horse"".  If you've seen ""Black Beauty"" and enjoyed, you'll definitely love this movie.

5051708,4,B0072GPQNG,"""War Horse"" is an epic film that has a grand scale and sweeping colorful horizons and golden skylines, reminding me instantly of the way movies of the 40s were shot, most particularly ""Gone with the Wind"". It has an old movie feel to it, and that, to me, was maybe its most shining attribute. Movies like ""War Horse"" don't exist anymore, so maybe that is why director Steven Spielberg chose to remind us of why maybe they should and why we miss them so much.

While there are large scale, World War I battle scenes, ""War Horse"" proves what truly has power of influence over movie audiences; heart, personality and relationship to characters (and horses) that we empathize with. Steven Spielberg isn't one of Hollywood's greatest director's for no reason. He knows, and has known for years that you can destroy things, make scenes rapid and exciting and full of spectacle, but if the audience doesn't have feelings for the characters, it is all for nothing.

The movie begins with the birth of a foal in a field with a young Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) watching on. From that moment on, Albert has found his love in life, a horse he later names Joey. The movie then follows the life of Joey as he changes hands, is given different names and experiences the joys and hardships of life. It is a fair comparison to the same ups and downs that humans experience. Joey is loved by Albert and a young girl named Emilie (newcomer Celine Buckens), but also faces terrible hardships as he dealt back and forth between soldiers at war.

""War Horse"" is at times a little overdone in the emotional category. In the later parts of the movie, it seems Joey is treated with some soft of respect that comes out of nowhere with people who haven't been privy to the journey the horse has taken. The reaction to the `miracle' horse is more for the audience then realistic as men drop everything their doing to come to the aid of one horse in the middle of a grand war.

That being said, the movie works if you don't think too much about it. ""War Horse"" works mostly for me just because Spielberg brought back some of the beauty of old style filmmaking, with bright horizons, dramatic dialogue and sweeping music that made you feel nostalgic, even though you were watching a movie made right now, in the 21st century.",1329782400,26,2301,4.577669902912621
5051709,5,B0072GPQNG,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. After seeing it at the theater I came onto Amazon, as I often do, to add it to my wishlist. I then read the unexcited reviews that were found on the product page and thought I should write a review to posit a counter opinion. The other reviews posted didn't seem to have enjoyed the film, two major criticisms being that they found it melodramatic and heavy handed, comments like these make me wonder if audiences have become so cynical that they view any attempt at displaying open/honest emotion to be an attempt at manipulation. Everyone has differing opinions but I feel this film will appeal to anyone who enjoys stylistically well made films and/or anyone who enjoys stories about bonds/will being tested. In a general sense Spielberg uses the story of this horse to explore the human condition and explore some very well done set pieces/environments.

As I saw it, the horse is a metaphor for hope and how it can be shared and spread, how it can inspire and endure. I don't mean this in an over sentimental way but just in a very real way. We are all hopeful for different things, big and small, and this film is about how under the right conditions and with the right persistence that hope can avoid being snuffed out or lost.

The film, based on a play I have not seen and cannot compare it to, is episodic as the horse goes from owner to owner during the years of World War 1. The fact that the film was episodic didn't make it feel chopped up or give it the feel of a broken narrative. I felt the through line of the film was the human condition and the traveling horse facilitated the telling of several viewpoints while exploring the excellent recreation of a time period. The acting was top notch by everyone seen on screen. To counter another criticism, the main human character, a boy named Albert, does show strong affection for the horse, a character in the film quips ""come on now boy, it's not as if he were a dog"". I didn't find this relationship to be strange, the horse simply becomes very important to Albert because as we see he doesn't have much to his life and the horse is something he gets that then works to make his life better. Perhaps I also never found it strange as I always found the horse to be representative of hope rather than as just some random animal.

The writing in terms of dialogue flowed and felt incredibly natural, as it does in most Spielberg films. John Williams score, while clearly a John Williams score, is the perfect mix of innocence, action/adventure and drama as the story calls for it. I would strongly compare the pacing and acting to Catch Me if You Can, as that film also had several major settings that shifted as the film progressed. I found War Horse to actually be better paced as it has a few more settings (about 5, possibly 6 in total?) and each one is shorter than the ones in the aforementioned film. Best of all the film actually ends when it ends, the story concludes and there are no tacked on or forced endings for the sake of pandering or over explaining as many recent films have had.

As far as the directing, I don't know if one can compare anything to the seeming effortless magic he created in his early films or certain efforts from the 90's but this would be Spielberg above his recent best and closer to those older films in quality. Everything unfolds visually in such an easy to follow an familiar way while still being unique and involving. There are some masterful shots that recall the opening of Saving Private Ryan but in an artistically different way. This is unquestionably due in part to the fact that this film has been made family friendly, while that could serve as a criticism I didn't find the film to be aimed specifically at families, though it has been made to facilitate viewing by younger children. Rather than illustrating the pure violence of battle as he did in SPR, Spielberg spends his time in this film showing the brutality of war in a creative fashion that suggests the horror more than displaying it. There is one such scene in particular where mounted soldiers ride into battle and on the other end of the shot their empty horses emerge without many of the riders they once carried.

In a sea of films about special effects, high concept stories or big names here is a film that is a complete film on its own without any gimmicks, as fun as gimmicks can be (Mi4 for example). This film is an actual experience for those who are open to it. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was an excellently crafted film that pushed the dark and grittiness, War Horse is a excellently crafted film that pushes the lighter elements but both are equally enjoyable and excellently made. Watching a good Spielberg film is like watching the epitome of what film is. It's like more recently watching Christopher Nolan's films, there are always flaws in any film but films such as theirs are so carefully and purposefully made as films that they are engaging and fully engrossing.

One potential weakness I will admit, though I feel a reviewing of the film would diminish it, is that the film doesn't have as strong an arc as most films. The characters change but so much of it is internal here. The horse's first owner does change but he is absent through the middle of the film, the various other owners also change in varying ways but all during their own vignettes. The horse itself has changed in much the same way as his owner as suggested by the final shot of the film, but perhaps critical audience members won't pick up on this. That said, one could (and I would say should) view this subtlety as purposeful. The film isn't as much about how the boy or the horse has changed but how despite all they've been through they managed to stay so much the same, they maintain what could easily have been lost.

I dunno, I personally love it (5 Stars) but for objectivity I'll give it 4/5 for general audiences, I think most everyone I described at the beginning of this review will like this film if they view it. For those who feel it is heavy handed and melodramatic go and watch Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, its also an excellent film but there is no overt display of emotion to be found there. Thanks for your time",1329609600,601,6239,4.49647266313933
5051710,4,B0072GPQNG,"On paper, this film must have appeared to be a tired contrivance-- so many cliches, so little to hold it together.  Yet, somehow, after making films for 40 years, Spielberg continues to get better and better at what he does better than anybody else.  One might say that the Spielberg film is a contradiction to the phrase ""they don't make them like they used to.""  Well, Spielberg does-- and in some ways better than anybody ever has.  That isn't to say a movie like War Horse is going to offer new insights into the human condition, but it does breathe new life into the hopeful, sugar coated miracle stuff that Hollywood lives and breathes on.

The images in this film are truly breathtaking.  And, it should be said, they go beyond cliche and achieve poetry.  It may be a kind of commercial poetry, but it is beautiful nonetheless.  And though many of the situations feel fake (especially one with a sick child and her kindly grandfather), and some of the sequences just reek of manipulation, most of them work wonderfully.  As much as I resisted, I teared up a couple of times.  Cynics may disagree, but I think Spielberg has an extraordinary and authentic emotional sense-- and I choose to believe its genuine.  The camera movement, the blocking-- the very conception of so many shots --  all function to communicate straight to the heart.

Just contrast the simple emotion in this film to a much more famous-- but much more fraudulent film--  Forest Gump.  Both films, of course, are wonderfully executed pieces of cinema magic.  But while both are fairy tales, and both play upon our desire for wishes to come true,  there's a big difference.  In this film (like most of Spielberg's movies), the simple emotion comes from basic truths.  People make fools of themselves,  horses (and farms) get lost to the boss man and to war.  Hard work means a lot but it doesn't always produce the desired result.  But sometimes, you get back what you lose.  Life isn't random, but it does spin off many colors.  In Forest Gump, on the other hand, the meek not only inherit the earth, they also get to own their own conglomerate!  And not only that-- those who work the hardest for change are shown up as fools.  Thus, Forest Gump turns out to be based on a Big Lie -- the lie that Reagan sold to America--  that brains and creative thinking-- and daring-- were the road to death (Jennie) or disfigurement (Dan).  Of course we know now that Reagan and his Big Lie actually destroyed the middle class-- and ruined our country.  But Big Business keeps propping up the Reagan brand since his laissez-faire narrative made them rich at everyone else's expense.

Spielberg's film, as mentioned before, is also a fairy tale.  But it doesn't pretend (as does Forest Gump) to offer a new spin to a key decade in history.  Gump is a travesty of the '60s-- and a slap in the face of real heroes like MLK and Robert Kennedy.  War Horse's connection with WW1 is purely casual.  This is not a film about a moment in time-- it is just a series of warm and fuzzy dreams that show us as we would like to be, and remind us that life is better when we are humble, kind, and a little brave.  No-- we don't get Bubba Gump Shrimp company t-shirts or the Porsche that Bob Zemeckis probably drives around in.  What we get-- and keep-- are our souls.

So-- don't go see War Horse expecting a serious work of art (unless you accept Damien Hirst's definition of art as ""anything done super well."")  But do go if you want to experience Hollywood magic (for better or for worse)  at its finest.

Bravo Spielberg.",1328140800,,3576,4.543887147335423

5051713,5,B0072GPQNG,"Steven Spielberg is a grade above most contemporary directors because he keeps his priorities right, on the story and relationships.  I hardly ever see movies in theaters today because most of them are crass and confusingly edited.  This movie's cinematography (by Janusz Kaminski) is rich and creative, and close-ups are used effectively to help you bond with the characters.  John Williams' music is once again enriching.  It is a movie about the adventures of a horse in World War I, but it's even more about the struggle to adapt and maintain stable relationships in war.  The horse is, for some of the characters, their closest companion.  Kind of like ""Sarah, Plain and Tall:  Winter's End"", War Horse's theme is about the need to build relationships as the fragility of life is impressed upon us.  In fact, at one point, the horse brings together the opposing sides in friendship in the ""no man's land"" between the trenches, reminiscent of the widespread real-life Christmas Truce which occurred in 1914.  Another thing that impresses me is the way it shows violence.  There's no blood on the whole movie that I saw, and powerful emotions of fear and relief are created through making you feel attached to the characters, not through graphic violence.  As a John Ford aficionado, I could see Ford's influence in Spielberg's storytelling, with the camera angle and position sometimes depicting an emotional closeness with the land and an ending told without words, like the end of Ford's movie The Searchers.  It left me with a wonderful feeling at the end of satisfaction and peace.  Way to go, Steven Spielberg!",1327104000,5,1619,4.973977695167286
5051714,4,B0072GPQNG,"I agree with the reviewer who said that this movie will probably be more enjoyable to people who love war movies rather than people who love horse movies. While not overly gory, the movie pulls no punches about the conditions of war. It was hard to see horses mistreated (yes, we cried), but one of the saving graces of the movie was that there were characters who loved horses and tried to help them.

What I loved about this movie was that it was not the usual Hollywood crap that is passed off as a ""family"" movie. There is a lot of substance here--family bonds, the bond between an animal and a human, and history. My 10-year-old (the war lover) really enjoyed it, while my 12-year-old (the horse lover) did not. However, both had a lot of questions and a lot of opinions about the situations in the movie. In my book, the good ""family"" movie is not necessarily one that everyone enjoys and wants to see again, but one that is rich in plot and details and will stimulate family discussion afterwards. (Note: I wouldn't take kids younger than 9 to this movie, it is too violent.)

The scenery and cinematograpy were beautiful. Benedict Cumberbatch was also beautiful, but unfortunately he didn't stick around too long.",1327017600,,1221,4.622119815668203

In my opinion, it also continues to reflect Steven Spielberg's willingness to take risks and be creative.  The story was visually stimulating.  Each character that ""owned"" the horse drew me in and I became involved.  I went to see this movie 2 times in it's opening weekend.  I have never before done that and I left the theatre telling my friends that I am going to purchase it.  Best movie I have seen in a long time.",1327017600,4,522,4.319587628865979
5051716,5,B0072GPQNG,"In Dartmoor, England a teenage boy named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine), watches in fascination as a thoroughbred colt is born. The baby horse is a beautiful animal and watching the equine run through the fields soon becomes Albert's new hobby. The day comes when the horse is taken to auction. Albert's father, Ted (Peter Mullan) comes to market to buy a plow horse, but when he sees the magnificent beast and spots his landlord smirking on the other side of the fence he ends up paying a small fortune to purchase the animal. Albert names the horse Joey and sets to training the animal. When the landlord threatens to take the family farm, Albert trains the animal to wear a horse collar and plow a field. However, when a destructive storm ruins the family's turnip crop, Ted is forced to sell the horse to the British cavalry for the war that has just been declared (1914). The animal is purchased by Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) who promises Albert that Joey will be his personal mount and he will return the horse to him after the war. It's off to France and after a foolish offensive Joey loses his mount and is captured by the Germans. What follows is an extraordinary journey for Joey as he changes hands from one owner to the next. The horse has a remarkable spirit of determination and raises to every challenge that comes before it. Meanwhile, Albert has joined the Army and is fighting on the Western front and carries with him an illustration of Joey. He's convinced they will find each other again.

WAR HORSE is an impressive movie. Visually, the film is a cinematic kaleidoscope of stunning wonder. It's like watching a Terrence Malick film, but with an actual story and lots of action.

The main character in the story is Joey, so if you don't like horses, you might not like the film. However, the human actors all do a fine job. Some of them are only on screen for a few minutes in a couple of scenes, but each of them excellently portrays the emotional depth of their characters. There are some who might say that the movie is filled with characterizations and no real acting, but this isn't the case. Most of the acting in the movie isn't done in broad gestures and over articulation. Instead, the real acting happens in the small moments: the way the eyes light up, the gentle turn of the head, etc. For instance, there is a scene where a German regiment invades a small farm and takes everything away from the farmer and his granddaughter who live there. There really isn't much action that happens in this scene and there aren't many words. However, volumes are spoken between the characters in how they say things and in the little things they do. WAR HORSE is filled with scenes like that.

Even if you aren't a horse or animal person, you can take a lot away from WAR HORSE. Though a horse is the main and title character, the movie is really about hope, perseverance, and determination. It is a story about the deep friendship between two kindred spirits. It's an ancient story that's been told again and again throughout history (the Biblical story of Joseph, ODYSSEY, THE AENIED, E.T., etc.). It's a story that resonates because it touches something deep within each of us. It's a grand old story, but in WAR HORSE it's just told through the eyes of a horse and his boy.",1326844800,2,3307,4.592216582064298

The story itself deals with the strength of equine and human spirits in the face of what are now the almost unimaginable privations of the First World War. Spielberg is well qualified to deal with such subjects: I have just finished watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pacific/dp/B003QP47RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pacific</a>&nbsp;and it's interesting to make the comparison.

Nevertheless this is, unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B00004Y3NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>for instance, a family film and while it doesn't shy away from the nastiness of the war, it remains sensitive to its younger audience members. I did take exception to Albert's rather miraculous recovery from what must obviously have been a fairly light gassing and I wondered at the sight of a Devonshire infantry regiment going ""over the top"" to the accompaniment of the bagpipes.

While the camerawork is excellent, the same cannot be said of other aspects of the production, with some glaring continuity errors and some appaling lighting work with characters casting three or four shadows in many scenes. Perhaps I'm too harsh and younger viewers may not notice these things.

My wife observed that the film remained faithful to the original story and while some inevitable editing had taken place, the main story elements were preserved and there was little mucking about from the screenwriters.  I however I felt that the film tended to lose the book's focus on Joey the horse and the film was as much, if not more, about the human characters (Albert in particular).

In the end, this is a decent piece of cinematic story telling, engaging, exciting and emotional. It is quite appropriate for younger viewers but they will need some adult help in understanding the issues raised. To a more critical eye however, it's clear that Spielberg took his eye off the ball with this one and it's by no means one of his best. I guess it will depend on the viewer but I found it to be a bit of a disappointment after the hype. My wife enjoyed it far more than I did.

And neither of us cried!",1326499200,2,2808,6.150510204081633
5051718,5,B0072GPQNG,"S.Spielberg gold. He took a long-loved youth's book written in 1982, and transformed it into a film so beautiful it reminded me of the English Countryside painter Thomas Gainsborough 18th century. Having been educated to teach visual art, I was captivated with the continual perfection of composition of very scene, seemingly every frame. I am an avid British film/TV viewer, but `War Horse' cinematography meets the highest of anything I have seen to date. The period sets, scenery, and costuming are perfection transforming the viewer into a time capsule of 1914 to the end of WWI. Stunning aesthetic mastery.

Janusz Kaminski must get some credit with Spielberg for the cinematography perfection.

I did read the book first and was confident (viewing the film proved me correct) that Spielberg would be true to the book. It's about as close as a film can get to a book. Being a shorter book, written for ages 11-13 originally, and the movie length (146 min) helped provide all of the needed key points of the story of the amazing red bay Joey. One could say plenty about the fine acting but it is the story, and the compelling adventures of the horse, told through the view-point of Joey (akin to Black Beauty) that makes this a must see, and once available, for me will be a MUST OWN.

The viewer literally rides through all kinds of situations, some heart wrenching, some heart stopping, some heart breaking, some heartache, while others end heart warming. Is it the horse that has all the heart and pours out from the screen; or is it the mastery of another Steven Spielberg directing/producing production that makes your pulse rise and fall in alarming changes? This is the first film in many a year that actually left me on the brink of tears. The end was so stunning that my wife and I could not move, could not get up and leave during the credits, and that was a plus since the credits footage contain some beautiful music that revives one's spirit after such an experience.

Yes, there is warfare, and from WWI books and photos I have seen, and a grandfather's eyewitness accounting, the film shows the war accurately. But even the battles were so beautifully filmed. Hats off to anyone on the film involved in the actual work of producing the visual aspect of `War Horse.'",1326153600,4,2284,4.731155778894473

5051720,3,B0072GPQNG,"""War Horse"" begins with the kind of sunlit bucolic scene one would expect from Steven Spielberg, followed by the inevitable bonding of a splendidly handsome horse named Joey with a splendidly handsome young man (Jeremy Irvine). Behind the sentiment is the portrayal of rural life in pre-WW I which hadn't changed much from the 17th century. Electricity and running water don't exist; plowing is still done gruelingly by hand behind a horse. All these harsh realities are complimented by evil landlords, callow heirs, weak, haunted fathers and sturdy, indomitable women, (especially Emily Watson, excellent as the only name actor in the film). The opening sequence of man and boy proving their mettle is clichd but still packs emotional and visual power. The film, however, takes off as World War I erupts and the horse is sold to the British Army. This sequence begins much as the war did, with cheering crowds and beautifully uniformed soldiers riding off to an unimaginable hell. Spielberg's portrayal of that horror is perfectly nuanced and he wisely resists the urge to graphically replicate ""Saving Private Ryan"". There is no splattering blood or flying limbs. The hardest scenes to watch, judging from my audience's reaction, involve the brutality suffered by the horses as they are either shot to death by machine gun fire or worked to death hauling Krupp howitzers up endless, muddy ridges. The soldiers, once so enthusiastic, have been reduced by the filth, terror, and hopelessness of trench warfare. Although some have pegged ""War Horse"" as an anti-war film, it doesn't bludgeon the message as World War I is now universally viewed as one of the most wasteful and unnecessary wars in human history. The Germans and Brits are equally responsible for this carnage and equally the victims of it. The Germans are not so much evil (that will come with the next war) but methodical, executing deserters (two young brothers in one of the sadder scenes) and looting French farmers (one portrayed as a Jean Valjean look-alike) in a dispassionate, business-like manner. In fact, one of the most sympathetic characters in the film is a German horse wrangler trying futilely to protect his charges from destruction. World War I has always been overshadowed in films by its successor, but with the centennial coming up, maybe that will change. Spielberg's one vivid battle scene captures the horror emphatically. The most poignant scene in the film, of lone German and British soldiers cooperating in No Man's Land to free a barbed wire entangled Joey, makes the film worth the watch. Unfortunately, from there, Spielberg drops the ball, staging a sappy reunion with horse and boy followed by an embarrassing reunion with boy and family, lit by the most exaggerated sunset in film history. Still, this being Spielberg, even that cannot ruin what is a well-staged tale, with some of the most glorious cinematography available.",1326067200,3,2923,5.104384133611691
5051721,3,B0072GPQNG,"War Horse is by no means a bad movie.  It was well acted, well scripted, and in many ways a deeply moving film.  But if you are a horse lover (as I am) it will likely be difficult for you to watch.

The movie follows a beautiful Thoroughbred named Joey through various phases of his life.  Unfortunately, the horse has a very difficult life, changing owners numerous times and going through some really harrowing experiences.  I thought some of the ugliness of war would be toned down since this movie will likely appeal to a wide audience especially because of how the ads play up the bond between the horse and the boy.  While there's not a lot of blood and gore, it is still very violent and at it is very much a war movie.

One of the first war scenes depicts a cavalry battalion (with Joey being towards the front) ambushing a group of unsuspecting soldiers.  A group of 100+ soldiers on horses rush toward the encampment and cut down several soldiers, some of them in the process of shaving and getting dressed.  But there are machine guns hidden in the trees and almost the entire battalion of horse and riders is cut down by machine gun fire as they head towards the trees.  Only a few horses (Joey included) survive.  This was a very difficult scene to watch and countless dead horses on the ground gave you an idea of how badly horses generally fared in wartime situations.

There is another very difficult scene to watch in which Joey is running away from a tank and runs in a blind panic over and around several bunkers, and eventually runs head long into several strands of barbwire.  He gets so bogged down in the barbwire that he flips end over end and is completely unable to free himself.  It was heartwrenching and terrible to watch.  However, the scene that follows was one of the most moving of the movie, where two soldiers from the opposing camps come together to free him.

One of the tired, but true, war adages that came to mind while watching this movie was ""war is hell.""  This proves to be true for pretty much everyone in the movie, especially the horse.  While this was a good movie in some respects, it is definitely not one I enjoyed watching.",1325894400,17,2175,4.463291139240506

Finally, he looked over at me, a teenager becoming a man and said, ""Dad, that may have been the best movie I've ever seen.""

As I was walking out of the theatre this evening, following a viewing of 'Warhorse,' he stepped into stride alongside me and said quietly, ""I sure miss seeing movies like this.""

5051724,5,B0072GPQNG,"Not too many films come along that possesses the traits of classic films of the past.  However, Steven Spielberg's direction for War Horse comes close to becoming a semi-epic film, especially with its running time of over two hours.  But what is notable about the film is the meticulous production and exceptional cinematography and multiple storylines interwoven almost like a short story anthology centered upon a horse named Joey and his faithful owner Albert (Jeremy Irvine) about the time that World War I erupts in Europe.  The film grows and grows as it proceeds with each separate encounter that Joey meets, but the horse is merely a backdrop and the people that happen to have him within their possession help to contribute to the care and compassion that they show towards Joey.

War Horse builds upon the various relationships that are established between man and horse.  Viewers will see about seven separate encounters that are finely intertwined within the film that will eventually reconnect when the movie concludes.  Indeed, one cannot deny the cinematography and the soundtrack that are compatible with each scene.  They are highly effective in invoking emotion and sincerity between each character.  And as viewers follow along with Joey's journey, especially during the beginning of the film, it is the symbolism and metaphors that are identifiable - the special emblem that Joey carries with him that is symbolic of Albert's father's heroism doing the Boer Wars in South Africa that happens to come into the possession of each new character that adds much sentimental value in terms of remembrance and memory as well as Joey finding his way back home; being this is a film that resonates much camaraderie during wartime and fellow man, Spielberg has much experience within that department having produced Saving Private Ryan. His drive for authenticity are clearly evident in War Horse, but not to compare this film to a list of other wartime depictions, there is also an inkling of Legends of the Fall that shows within this film that extremely tugs with the emotions; catch the scenes of the no man's land at the Battle at Marne or Battle of the Somme that captured the ravages of war wound with barbed wire fences that even a horse gets entangled but not succumbed to the challenge.

Overall, it was a delight to have watched War Horse.  And not to dwell on other comparisons, but one more footnote comes to mind that relates to films or depictions between man and all living creatures.  Before deciding to watch War Horse, be prepared to carry along tissue because by the last hour, think about films such as Black Beauty, Lassie Come Home, Old Yeller, or even E.T.",1325808000,4,2690,4.929203539823009
5051725,3,B0072GPQNG,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Rating: 3.5

As with most Spielberg films, the eye catching visuals, usually outweigh the dramatics. That includes 'War Horse', originally a short children's novel, later turned into a superb stage play involving life-sized puppets. 'War Horse' is full of masterful visual scenes that are up there with some of the classic scenes in cinematic history.

The two scenes that really stick in my mind are the cavalry charge and Joey's solo run through the battlefield. It's a real twist when Spielberg has the British instead of the Germans as the aggressors, leading a cavalry charge on seemingly unsuspecting German troops. What Spielberg suggests here is that in the 'pointless' war that was World War I, even the 'good guys' could be just as 'bad' as the 'bad guys'. Not only do the British come off as bloodthirsty but also incompetent, as obviously they have been provided with faulty intelligence and end up roundly defeated when they and their horses run into a nest of German machine gunners. As the camera pulls back, the full horror of the war is depicted not in shots of bloody soldiers but in the massacre of gentle cavalry horses.

The horror of the war becomes even more 'up close and personal', when Spielberg focuses on the fate of Joey, the horse raised in the English countryside by Albert Narracott, the young teenage protagonist, who later loses his beloved steed to the Army, after his father is forced to sell the graceful animal, to save the family farm. With minimal CGI effects, we follow Joey as he runs riderless on the battlefield, dodging countless explosions from both artillery and sniper fire. When Joey ends up tangled in barbed wire, man's inhumanity to man is illustrated through the suffering of an innocent equine. But Spielberg also believes in a message of hope, for Joey is soon to be extricated from his wiry imprisonment, by a German and British soldier, who come out of their trenches, after a momentary truce is declared.

It would be impossible to evaluate 'War Horse' without also referring to the stage play which the film is primarily based on. In the stage play, Joey's father, Ted, is pitted against his own brother and their conflict feels much more elemental, than the toothless rivalry between the father and his landlord, as depicted in the film. The film's screenwriters also failed to utilize an assortment of local gentry, characters in the community which add to the verisimilitude of an English village on the eve of World War I. I also recall that the stage play had some wonderful songs sung by the colorful locals--there were a couple of particularly moving musical scenes, when the men go off to war and especially when Albert returns with Joey, after the Armistice is declared.

Spielberg's other mistake is to hit us over the head with his anti-war theme. The brilliant and detailed battle scenes are not enough for Spielberg; he's got to throw in two unnecessary subplots to drive his point home further. Those include the two young German deserters who meet an untimely end by way of firing squad and a French grandfather and sickly daughter, who briefly hide Joey and another war horse, Topthorn, from German soldiers, who eventually discover them and haul them off for further unwelcome battle service.

Spielberg wisely duplicates the dramatic and emotional reunion between Albert and Joey found in the novel and stage play. In the play, Albert makes a triumphant return with Joey to his village and is celebrated in song by his community. In the film, however, there's the unnecessary diversion of the French grandfather purchasing Joey, before changing his mind and giving Joey back to Albert. Some may find that the grandfather's act of great generosity is an effective wrap up for 'War Horse', but for me, the true climax occurs when Albert finds Joey and prevents him from being put down.

Finally, Albert's reunion with his father in the film, is not as moving or dramatic as what happens on stage. Unfortunately, 'Ted' is such a morose character in the film, that we hardly can care when he bonds with his son at film's end. Likewise, Jeremy Irvine, doesn't quite have the gravitas to pull off the role of Albert as Seth Numrich did, in the Broadway production at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in New York.

'War Horse' is about one half hour too long. But this is Spielberg, and who's going to tell the ""maestro"", that his fine film needs a little bit of judicious editing? Nonetheless, 'War Horse' is still an impressive achievement especially in regards to some brilliant cinematography and staging of battle scenes, which relied little on artificial, computer generated special effects.",1325635200,2,4704,4.899497487437186
5051726,2,B0072GPQNG,"Did not hate or love this movie.

5051727,3,B0072GPQNG,"Perhaps it is me, but I find it extremely difficult to enjoy movies directed by Stephen Spielberg. Yes, Spielberg is a legendary filmmaker, whose films have grossed billions of dollars over a four decade span. He has won loads of Oscars and brought joy to billions of people; and his achievements have made him one of the most influential people in earth's history. Yet despite all of that, I usually cannot bring myself to watch a Spielberg film in a movie theatre. Why is this? Well, apart from ""Schiendler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", the majority of his films are steeped in treacly sentiment, and I cannot abide it any longer. Spielberg's purpose as a filmmaker is to provide the movie goer with a conduit to their childhood. In order for him to successfully do this, he directs films that are centered around a chaste love story of some kind; or there might be a film where a ""cute"" relationship between a child and a pet/robot/alien will be longingly examined. Some of you may remember that the direction of the movie ""A.I"" was inherited by Spielberg after Stanley Kubrick died during the making of that film. The half of the movie that was directed by Kubrick was excellent and lauded by fans and critics alike. Instead of continuing Kubrick's vision, Spielberg usurped the film, injected his own sensibility into its direction, and crafted a second half of a movie that confused and disoriented critics and movie goers. The end of ""A.I"" was too sentimental and cloying, and engendered some enmity towards Spielberg. As a movie lover, I like to watch dramatic movies that are emotionally honest even if the subject matter is fantastical. Apart from the two period pieces that I mentioned(which are based on historical events) he seems incapable of doing so.

The film ""Warhorse"" is a typical Spielberg film.  Set during the period of the first World War, the movie begins as a story about a boy(Albert) and his horse(Joey). Albert's father and mother are wilting beneath excessive financial burdens. However, the father fails to take these financial responsibilities into account when he purchases Joey at an auction.  There is just something about that horse that compels the father to continue bidding at his own peril. He buys the horse at a price that is way beyond his means, and after the initial euphoria at the purchase of the horse wanes, he realizes that he has spent all of his money on a horse that cannot plow the field. Upon seeing the horse, Albert also falls in immediate love with the animal and firmly resolves to take it under his wing. The purchase of the horse has left the family without money for rent, and their cruel and callous landlord will soon be coming to collect.  The only hope for the family is if the boy can teach the horse to plow so that the land on which the family lives can be cultivated for crops.  After much effort by Albert, and derision and doubt from the father and the landlord, Albert is able to teach the horse to plow the farm.  The land is subsequently cultivated, the family has hopes of selling the crops for profit, and paying of the landlord and keeping their farm.  Unfortunately, there is a rainstorm and the crops are washed away in the storm.  With no hope left, the father absconds away with the horse and sells it to the British army.  It is the advent of the 1st World War(1914)and horses are of great value to the British army. Devastated, Albert begs his father to rescind the transaction. He even offers to enlist as a soldier in the army so that he may stay with his horse. But Albert's youth makes him ineligible for service, and he is forced to say a tearful goodbye to his beloved pet.

Joey becomes a ""War Horse"" during WWI. He is originally used by the officer who purchased him from Albert's father as a cavalry horse. That is until the officer is killed by the German army, and Joey, along with another black horse, effectively becomes an orphan during the war. Not to worry though. As a tandem, Joey and his friend melt the hearts of the people with whom they come into contact as they wander aimlessly through war torn Europe. Some of these caretakers are soldiers, others are civilians. It doesn't really matter who because all who come into contact with the two horses immediately succumb to their charms. The horses bring out the best in their caretakers during this war, as they all exhibit courage, love, and sacrifice during the most difficult circumstances. The horses act as a common thread in this film, a thread that when touched by human beings transforms them into better people.

Joey's equine friend eventually dies of a lame leg, but Joey marches onward. During the war's duration, Albert is able to enlist as a soldier in the British army. After Albert is injured during a firefight that temporarily blinds him, and Joey is brought to a military camp by a soldier who rescues him from being entangled in barb wire, the two friends eventually reunite. As a consequence of their reunion, Albert and Joey are able to go home together after the conclusion of the war.

I watched this movie after having previously watched ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" in the same movie theatre. These movies could not be more dissimilar except for one similarity: they are both long movies. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" runs for 2 hours 38 minutes, while ""War Horse"" runs for 2 hours 26 minutes. That said, the ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" felt like a shorter movie than ""War Horse"", and that is part of the reason why ""Dragon Tattoo"" was so much better.  ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" seems to zip by while ""War Horse"" seems to plod along like a Clydesdale towing a romantic couple through the park. ""War Horse"" feels like a movie that is all of 2 hours 26 minutes long. The excessive length of this movie caused me to repeatedly stir in my seat, and I began to wonder when and if it would ever end.

Don't get me wrong. ""War Horse"" is well made. The acting is very good by all who are involved, and I am a sucker for adventurous and/or epic period pieces.  Still, the movie reeks of convention and that signature Speilberg sentiment. The movie's ending wraps everything up too nicely, and I was left unfulfilled as a result.  Still, if you are a fan of Spielberg's more sentimental work, this is the movie for you.",1325203200,4,6315,4.635062611806798

The movie shows the ravages of the cavalry in the Great War.",1325203200,7,364,4.231884057971015
5051729,3,B0072GPQNG,"I am not a big admirer of Steven Spielberg overall but I respect his vast technical skills as a filmmaker and I'm always happy to see another of his productions. He hasn't directed a film since 2008's ""Indiana Jones 4"", a movie that got a lot of flak from critics and audiences. I thought it was an entertaining summer adventure film that ultimately didn't capture the magic of the terrific Indy trilogy from the 1980s.

Now Spielberg is back with two films that were released in the span of one week in December 2011. I haven't seen ""Adventures of Tintin"" just yet, instead I opted to watch ""War Horse"", the more serious of the two pictures. Spielberg is really going for the classic Hollywood look and feel here. Partially inspired by David Lean with it's Englishness, the main parallel in style would seem to be John Ford. Sweeping vistas, landscapes and the glory and toil of the farm life. The film is also one of the most blatant, emotionally manipulative Spielberg has ever made. Think of E.T. but with a horse and you've got the outline of this film already. John Williams turns in one of his most heart tugging scores. Every little moment and plot point is underpinned by a musical touch to bombard the audience with the message. I didn't enjoy E.T. when I saw it as a child or when I saw it as an adult. I understand that many in the audience do enjoy this kind of manipulation but I'm not one of them. War Horse has the same underlining feel but it's expansive and visually diverse enough to hold one's attention.

The cinematography is stunning throughout. Almost too perfect, a kind of postcard quality. The acting is on pitch for every character. The pacing is taut and judicious, the action scenes thrilling. The technical aspects are always A+ with a mature Spielberg movie. The film is very episodic however as we follow the birth and life of ""Joey"", the war horse. Raised on an English farm, then sold to a British captain... Joey is then captured by the Germans, later he finds his way into the life of an elderly man and his granddaughter living on a farm in the French countryside... then recaptured by the Germans which leads to a harrowing escape scene, which is one of the most dramatic sequences in the whole film. Like a present wrapped in a neat ribbon, all comes to a happy conclusion in the end.

The film reminded me a little bit of ""Au Hasard Balthasar"" a French film from the early 1960s directed by Robert Bresson. In that film, a donkey is the star and goes through life from one owner to another. It's the human condition as viewed through the eyes of an animal. War Horse has a similar feel to it, as if Joey is suffering humanity's sins, a Christ like figure. Of course Bresson and Spielberg are like night and day. Bresson's film is depressing, heartfelt and honest... Spielberg's film is manipulative and sentimental but exciting. I just make a note of it for audiences... if you want to see another take on this story structure but from a ""high art"" angle, check out ""Au Hasard Balthasar"".

Putting negatives aside, I would say that War Horse does it's job and is exactly the kind of film it aspires to be. This is the first WWI movie for Spielberg so that gives him plenty of room to film trench warfare and chaotic battle scenes. All expertly done as one would except from the director of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Don't expect any blood as this is a strictly PG-13 portrayal of the conflict. Ultimately I don't think that War Horse will be remembered as a Spielberg classic in years to come but it's a solid picture in the crowded holiday marketplace and worthy of your time and money.",1325203200,7,3625,4.546707503828484
5051730,1,B0072GPQNG,"This is a silly movie, which absolutely underplays the human suffering of the First World War, while showing exaggerated concern for a horse.  In ""Joey""'s movement from adoring owner to adoring owner, I was reminded of what happened to TV's Lassie, when the human counterparts became too old for their roles.  How laughable that this formula-type animal flick will be up for Golden Globe & Academy Awards.",1325203200,4,405,5.029850746268656
5051731,5,B0072GPQNG,"I am old enough  to remember, as a boy, meeting the survivors and widows of the First World War.  In a sense, it has become a ""forgotten"" war with History Channel 1 & 2 focusing on pawn brokers and Hitler. (Not just the History Channels by the way.)  War Horse brings back a forgotten era of slaughter and poor decisions by politicians.  And it makes it more interesting through the eyes of Joey, and how Joey affects the lives of the many people who stumble upon him  There isn't any judgement in the film, which side is ""moral"", but, ultimately that humanity can come to the front in an otherwise inhumane world.

This is a 5 star movie.",1325203200,13,639,4.372881355932203
5051732,2,B0072GPQNG,"MOVIE NOTE #18 WAR HORSE
Steven Spielberg, for me, is one of the quintessential directors of this century - having been the reason for six of the top ten films of all time - all of which are my favorites (`E.T.-The Extraterrestrial', `Jaws', `Schindler's List', `Jurassic Park', ` Raiders of the Lost Ark' - but - like a couple of his other films (`Empire of the Sun' & `War of the World') this movie fell short for me. The last 20 minutes of the film, although reminiscent of `Gone With The Wind' and `The Wizard of Oz', are amazingly touching in the Spielbergian way - but the rest f the two hours....yawn. With a lot of long shots, a lot of green-screens and a lot of `what's this story about', going on in my head...I was disappointed.

Starring a relatively unknown cast it's the story of a young man (Jeremy Irvine of BBC TV's `Life Bites') meeting, gaining and growing up with `Joey' a beautiful thoroughbred horse with a distinctive white marking on its head. His mother and father (Emily Watson of `Corpse Bride' and `Red Dragon' and Peter Mullan of `Braveheart' and `Trainspotting') having a small farm and WWI looming around the corner end up selling this horse to the British war efforts. This same horse ends up being a surviving `hero' and helping, loading and lifting the spirits of various aspects of what WWI did to the English countryside families and their homes.

There are some really great scenes, especially between a German soldier and a British soldier trying to free Joey from an incredibly filmed escape scene where the horse literally runs through barbed wired fences and traps himself. Amazing stunt work in this sequence.

All-in-all it ends in the Spielbergian way that's obviously meant to grab yoru heartstrings - however - it is a little clich&eacute; for me. And, the photography seemed artificial - noticeable - almost unreal in parts. It just distracted me. I would suggest seeing other far more entertaining and better done films like `Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' or `The Muppets' before this one! Sorry Steven, you missed the mark for me.",1325116800,5,2085,4.802228412256268
5051733,4,B0072GPQNG,"Most of us have read about dogs that after a distant separation from their human families, find their way back home.  There are also cinematic versions.  I recall ""Homeward Bound: An Incredible Journey"", and a Lassie film from the 1940's and I think Rin-Tin-Tin; but that might have been TV.  In any case, director Steven Spielberg ups the ante, this time with a horse named Joey.

An English farmer, out of spite for his landlord (David Thewlis), buys a young horse at an auction.  He needed a larger horse for purposes of plowing but was a wee bit tipsy at the time.  The son, Albert (Jeremy Irvine) raises the horse that is unusually smart, strong and sociable.  Eventually, in need of cash, the father (Peter Mullan) sells the horse to a young army officer (Tom Hiddleston) at the dawn of World War I.  Spielberg then sets events in motion that follow Joey and his fellow horses through numerous battles, arduous labor, escapes and engagements with English and German armies and French farmers.  Aided by longtime partner, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg paints a beautiful portrait of landscapes, sunrises and sunsets.

The film does stretch believability at times.  Would a horse volunteer for duty to pull a canon up a hill in place of a fellow horse?  It also would have made more sense to have Germans speak German and French speak French but I guess subtitles over even small sections of film would scare off some audiences.  This is old fashion movie making and even with some bleak battle scenes and animal mistreatment, will attract families.  Sure it's sentimental and even cheesy at times, but it has a strong moral foundation and it ultimately uplifting.",1325030400,11,1681,4.873239436619718
5051734,5,B0072GPQNG,"WAR HORSE conjures up feelings I had when I first read BLACK BEAUTY years ago, the saga of a horse who went from owner to owner amid a series of mostly unhappy circumstances. The difference here is the background (World War I), the luscious farm scenes that start the tale, the colorful faces of the village folk, and at the center of the tale, an earnest and good-looking lad (Jeremy Irvine) who adopts the horse and must turn it into a plow horse so his family can retain their farm.

And when the war comes, the grim scenes of battle offer a stark contrast to the sentimental scenes at the start, as the horse proves himself to be a fine specimen until he is caught in a barbed wire situation that requires the assistance of British and German soldiers to put aside the war while they free him from suffering and pain.

The usual bombastic score that John Williams gave many of Spielberg's action films is missing here. Instead, there are delicate melodies played brilliantly on flute for the lighter moments and impressive richer sounds for the dramatic highlights. It's a lovely piece of craftsmanship.

So is the film, which shows a high level of craftsmanship throughout, the settings and costumes realistic, the performances beyond reproach, and the sentimental happy ending so welcome after all the audience has been through with the brave war horse. Credit must go to Steven Spielberg for his detailed direction and to his cinematographer for the stunning camera work.

By all means, one of the best Spielberg films to come along in a long time. Jeremy Irvine is perfectly cast in the leading role and all of the supporting players are well cast, particularly Emily Watson, David Thewlis, Peter Mullan, Neil Arestrup and Benedict Cumberbatch.

Solid entertainment, it holds the interest throughout despite its length. Certainly one of the best films of 2011.",1324944000,15,1868,4.861635220125786
5051735,2,B0072GPQNG,"I was hoping for so much more than this from Spielberg. It's basically the 1943 (?) movie of Lassie Come Home starring Roddy McDowell and Liz Taylor: Poor family has animal everyone wants, poor family has money problems, sells said animal to pay bills, said animal wants to come home, travels miles, meets up with many people who help it, finds owner in the end. End of Story! The Collie is merely changed into a horse. No doubt the serial copier/remakers of Hollywood will make the same story again with a cat or a bird or a gerbil. There are soooo many to choose from.

As far as equine technical advice, this movie was so incredibly unbelievable. Joey runs thru 2, count them, TWO, barbed wire fences, wrapped tightly from head to foot, yet when cut loose, not a drop of blood or a cut. Personally I've seen horses who have tangled with barbed wire. The wire wins! This animal would have been hamburger. There were no tetanus shots nor antibiotics in 1918 to my knowledge, certainly not on a battle field.

It was talky, a LOT of war, a whole lot less horse scenes than, say, ""Horse Whisperer"" which is still a superior horse movie.

I've lived 66 years and have come to the realization that war will NEVER end. Men must have their wars. I have nothing against soldiers, but everything against war. If there are no wars, men make them up and ""play soldier"" on the weekends. To quote from the movie, ""Everyone loses everything in war."" To men I say: If you must kill each other please LEAVE THE ANIMALS OUT OF IT!! Spielberg is an anti-war liberal. Why is he so enamored with war?????

Only gave it 2 stars for the phenomenal cinematography.

Rent this one, don't waste your money.",1324944000,3,1683,4.504918032786885
5051736,4,B0072GPQNG,"Okay, I'll admit that War Horse tries too hard to make you cry over and over again, but it reminds me of an old fashioned epic. The acting is good all around, the locations are a sight to behold, there is some good action mixed in, and boy oh boy is that a well trained horse. Joey (the horse) has a personality all his own and I began really caring for this guy more and more throughout each of his adventures. It might be too violent for the really young ones, but this is the type of film that families can see together. Steven Spielberg has added another gem to his historic directing career. I can't wait to see what he and the great Daniel Day-Lewis do with Lincoln.",1324944000,12,672,4.217054263565892

Old fashioned cinematic storytelling is at work here so don't see this movie if you are anticipating Matrix , Die Hard or any recent Nicholas Cage action flicks. About fifteen minutes into the film I said to myself thank you lord for giving us filmmakers like S. S. who know how to tell great stories on celluoid. This is why I go to the movies in the first place. War Horse is a winner all the way to the finsih line. No need for a full review just remember if you love old style old school film making like John Ford and Frank Capra then get in line. If not then you will be bored.
