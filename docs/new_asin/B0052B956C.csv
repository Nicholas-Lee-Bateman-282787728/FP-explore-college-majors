With research I discovered there's a series of these mega-boxing highlight DVDs:

The manufacturer, IMPACTO DEPORTIVO, may be an outside-the-US concern.

How legal all these titles are is anyone's guess.
Superimposing a watermark over a broadcaster's ID isn't a good sign, though.",1329177600,3,1226,10.192660550458715
8454698,4,B0052B956C,"When I first purchased this item, I really didn't know what to make of it, and what exactly the dvd contained. The Box looked cheesy and low budget, and I had never heard of the company that made the DVD. There is also  no information on the box such about a copyright date, and there is a Typo with Bernard Hopkins' and Arturo Gatti (Bernard Hopking and ANTONIO Gatty, LOL) and the side of the box has the title printed the wrong way so it looks weird in your DVD stack with the letters going backwards. And I never expected in my wildest dreams that HBO and Showtime would allow a company like this to take boxing footage of big fights such as Mosley/Margarito, Froch/Taylor,even Paul Williams/Sergio Martinez 2 among others, to gain profit from, so I thought that maybe these where earlier fights of these big-named fighters on the front of the box BEFORE they were exposed by the two major boxing networks on tv, but was I wrong.  You can tell however that this was a low budget DVD, and the company who produced the DVD (VideoVisa) stamps their logo over HBO and Showtime's around the round timer possibly because of a copyright issue, but I'm not sure. The only option in the menu is play all, so if you want to see a knockout that was numbered in the order of the dvd of 50s and up it will take you a long time to press next to get to it, this DVD also doesn't contain names of the two fighters being shown, only the number of knockout on the DVD (so for example if you watched 18 kos, the next one would be titled 'Knock Out 19'), which can really be confusing if a big name fighter isn't fighting during that knock out and the announcers don't say the names of the boxers, this can be especially confusing if you are a casual boxing fan and not a hardcore one. The video quality also isn't the best on the DVD and they do not, I repeat, DO NOT show entire fights, they show about 2 mins of the fight right before the knockout occurs. All in all though I recommend this DVD for your library if you are a boxing fan (Casual, and especially the Hardcore ones) considering there are not many Boxing DVDs out there with this much boxing footage except for 45 Fantastic Fights of the Century, which is a shame. Unfortunately HBO and Showtime do not make Boxing event DVDs that they aired in the past for boxing like the UFC Mixed Martial Arts does because they don't think it would be very profitable. All in all though, a great buy for your buck and a very exciting and entertaining DVD containing recent knockouts, as well going back all the way to even the likes of Hearns/Barkley, Arguello/Rooney, Roberto Duran, Ray Mercer, etc. I'm satisfied with my purchase.",1321920000,3,2668,4.387878787878788
