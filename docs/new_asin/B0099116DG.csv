5278885,4,B0099116DG,"I like gritty British crime dramas but hadn't heard about this one until I started to look for movies with Ian McShane in them. Many of the feature films McShane has been in weren't that great in and of themselves, tho McShane always looks amazing--and that voice!--but this film seemed like it would be different.

I really enjoyed Villain. It has a great sense of 70s London--its streets, bedsits, girlie shows, and smokestacks--and there's an exciting action scene that's quite realistic and visceral without all of the flashy special effects of today's actioners. I thought Burton did a good job too even though ppl made fun of his attempt at an East End accent.

The video quality is excellent with this digital download. There's one caveat--I realized during the first scene at a club that the voices of Burton's crew and his informer had been dubbed. So too in the Inspector's garden when his sergeant visits him. And then horror! McShane's wonderful voice gone! He was dubbed as well. I love East End accents, but they'd all been sanitised. Even Donald Sinden's distinctive voice, with its upper class accent, had been dubbed.

So if you buy this beware. I was so disappointed that I hopped back on amazon and bought a VHS of Villain in hopes I could hear MsShane properly. I was rewarded with a VHS marked 'Rank Organisation Export' that has the original dialogue track complete with wide screen, same as the digital download--McShane's voice is restored as are the other supporting characters. Not dvd quality video, but I could enjoy the movie in its original form without the distraction of the dubbing.",1416441600,4,1615,4.865454545454545

5278887,1,B0099116DG,Burton must have needed the money as the acting was stiff and the script even worse.  His movies before Cleopatra are far superior.,1403308800,,131,4.695652173913044
5278888,4,B0099116DG,"Burton is my all time favorite star, and although I'm no fan of crime movies I had to watch this one.
I really liked it and thought that it is an underrated little gem.
The cast of course is first rate, the locations on the streets of London in the 1970s are very interesting. I also like that despite its intense theme, the film does not rely on blood and gore to stress its brutality.

The script, in my opinion although intelligent and moving on a swift pace, needed some further developments.
I thought some events happened abruptly and needed some building-up, the film also needed to be a bit longer to make way for more cohesion. However, the final scene is very well constructed and impressive.
Despite some flaws, I really like this film and think that it is worth watching.",1386892800,8,783,4.514084507042254
5278889,3,B0099116DG,"I'm a big Burton fan but I can only give Villain a 3 star recommendation. On the plus side Villains theme, location, action and dialogue are a signpost to later T.V icon series 'The Sweeney' and the modern Brit gangster genre. I also tip my hat to the convincing cast, writers and director. Nevertheless for me Vic Dakin the main gangster character required a younger Burton in his Mark Anthony prime to affect a more menacing physicality; much like Oliver Reed achieves in a similar role in `Sitting Target'. Coincidently Ian McShane alternatively plays with aplomb the main mans shag and side kick in both movies. That the Sweeney series in particular is the improved step child of Villain in terms of direction and development is fame enough. Yet Villain in itself remains a disjointed work in progress, rather than the finished article. Flawed but worth watching.",1294704000,8,867,4.904761904761905

8537914,2,B0099116DG,"This used to be shown on afternoon broadcast television, several years after its release.  I'm reminded how disappointing a film it is.  As an adult, I now see Burton was a wreck while off the drink.  Poor guy.",1489536000,,210,4.473684210526316
8537915,5,B0099116DG,I read that Burton made this movie part in retaliation for the horrible beating he suffered during a day off during filming of VIP's,1473033600,,132,4.541666666666667
8537916,4,B0099116DG,Every great actoe wants to play a dasterdly bad gu. This Burton at his better acing as the worst human  on the planet. This is a move of the times that should be watched  by crime film viewers and film noir lovers especially befre seeing Ganster #1 or ny of the modern britiah ganster films. This on sets the standard!,1462838400,,318,4.283333333333333
8537917,5,B0099116DG,"The model for the classic gangster film was cemented by ""Little Caesar"", ""Public Enemy"", and ""Scarface"" and refined by ""The Godfather Saga"".  When the film code relaxed its standards by the late Sixties the Brits introduced a new language to the organized crime genre but the public wasn't quite ready for it.  Films like this one, ""Get Carter"", and ""Sitting Target"" introduced a harsh realism and brutality that made Cagney and Bogart seem tame in comparison and laid the groundwork for later films like ""The Long Good Friday"" and ""Mona Lisa"".  The character of Vic Dakin that Richard Burton portrays here is unlike anything he's tackled before or after, a virtual human powder keg with a short fuse.  Vic rules the underworld with his personal patent of viciousness and intimidation that gives enemies and associates pause.  This is an excellent performance by Burton careful not to overplay the character assaying Vic's innate ruthlessness despite the fact he's portraying a doting mama's boy with sadistic sexual proclivities .  The main plot threads concern a payroll robbery involving Vic that goes awry and the police efforts to nab him.  This is edge-of-your-seat stuff and there's a brilliant closing shot though it may be lingered on too long.  Recommended for Burton enthusiasts of strong constitution.",1430611200,3,1313,5.160377358490566
8537918,4,B0099116DG,"I saw this movie many years ago when I was in the service. I enjoyed it and was very happy to see that it was on DVD. The British can and do make some really great gangster movies such as ""The Long Good Friday"", ""Charlie"" and ""The Krays"". I hope that ""The Krays"" will become available in the states on DVD in the near future.",1421798400,2,325,4.015384615384615
