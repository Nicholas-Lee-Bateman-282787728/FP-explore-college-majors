8576676,1,B000056T58,"First, the entire DVD IS censored with swearing bleeped out and gore that was blurred. About half of the chases show you the beginning, then the end without showing the action that happened in between.

I gave this DVD one star because of two scenes on the DVD. One where the pick-up is hit by a semi-truck, and second for the guy blowing his head off. Cops on television is much more entertaining than this DVD.",1100131200,10,412,4.421052631578948
