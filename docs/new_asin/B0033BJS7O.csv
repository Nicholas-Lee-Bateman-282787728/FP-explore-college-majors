Las canciones no estan del todo mal, pero me molesta sobre manera que pormocionen este DVD como un concierto en vivo, cuando en realidad el tipo lo que esta es doblando.",1330819200,,258,4.630434782608695

The setting was so intimate and very enjoyable to watch, that I felt I was at my own personal concert.  I was so taken by this DVD, now I have to get the matching CD!  LOVE IT!",1299196800,,278,3.9107142857142856
