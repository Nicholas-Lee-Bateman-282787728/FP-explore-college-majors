8292425,4,B001DABCQ2,"I purchased this thinking that it would be a ""whatever""-did not have time to watch a movie but was nothing on basic tv(all we have is antenna - got rid of dish and cable-for a BIG YEARLY saving).  So I bought some movies real cheap at CBD for us to watch on the weekends mostly.  I was really blown away with this little (only a little over an hour long) movie.
Now to be straight with you....if you do not like musicals at all....you will NOT like this.  My husband disliked it just because of the music.  And that was the main thing I loved about it.
It is not a pushy-christian film.  It is mainly about how important family is-and sometimes you don't notice HOW important till the end.
An old cranky ""star"" wakes up in the past -when she was 17 years old.  Becky seems to think that ""she does not need ANYONE"" and that what others thinks of her is more important than her family.
I chuckled in a few spots and had to rewind watching a few of the songs because I enjoyed them so much.  This is not a heavy handed christian movie.  I think as long as you like musicals you will enjoy this light hearted -feel good movie.
To be honest with you.. I plan to keep this movie so that when visiters come and are looking for somethig to watch -we can stick that in
This movie is approved for all ages--no cursing or sex or indecently dressed people.  It is a great way to introduce ""musical style"" movies to your kids.
I would highly recommend this movie--and for the price of  $3.99--like i got it for --well, you cant really go wrong.",1378425600,,1531,4.230240549828179
