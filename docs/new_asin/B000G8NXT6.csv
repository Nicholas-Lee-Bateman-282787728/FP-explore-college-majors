8129421,4,B000G8NXT6,"My grandson really likes the Berenstain Bears.  I bought another dvd before, and his mom said he liked the show.  Though there are some episodes on that one I feel are for older children after watching it, he started liking the bears.  I bought the newer version later on, which was more kid appropriate. This was the version I've always liked anyway.  Everytime he visits, he wants to see this show.  The smile on his face is worth it alone.  He will sit and watch all the shows if you let him.  Then later on, he will ask to see it again.

It is really a cute  cartoon, and the dvd shows great.  It has continuous playing as well. The previews are a nice addition.  He likes to watch those as well.  There are six episodes to watch.  This show can be costly, so I do shop around. I will buy more dvd's.",1330128000,,804,4.176470588235294
8129422,5,B000G8NXT6,"My five year old grandson loves these cartoons. He prefers the Auto B Good cartoons, but these are his second most favorite. I love them because of the life lessons they teach; honesty, friendship, dependability, love, family values, community ethics, etc. They are wonderful reinforcement to the concepts I try to instill in my children. I very highly recommend any and all the DVD's made by Berenstain Bears.",1271808000,3,410,5.044117647058823
8129423,4,B000G8NXT6,"We bought this DVD and ""The Berenstain Bears - Fun Family Adventures"" to complement the bedtime books in our sons' bookshelf.

The title of my review reflects my sons' first viewing of the DVD. We had spent the day playing bocce (check out my review of the Halex Classic Series Bocce Set) at a neighborhood park. It was almost 4 p.m. and our boys were getting tired. Too late for a nap and too early for dinner, I instructed them to get up on the couch while I loaded the DVD.

Just like the books, each story has a message. This DVD has six episodes:

The Excuse Note
On the Job
The Giddy Grandma
The Bad Habit
Draw It
The Female Fullback

Each episode is about 10 minutes long - the entire DVD runs 82 minutes. The animation matches the books. The voice acting is solid. Overall, this is a nice addition to your Berenstain Bears collection of books and DVDs.",1218240000,12,860,4.3229813664596275
