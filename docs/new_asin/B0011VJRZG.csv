8242634,3,B0011VJRZG,"Tony Randall and Woody Allen are two of the MCs introducing the circus acts. Poor quality but still one for fans of Circus's to own. The third DVD has a spectacular animal act with Lions, Tigers, Panthers, all mixed together. I would say it is as good as Gunther Gebel Williams' act, if not better. Well worth the small cost to buy this on Amazon. And who doesn't like a circus?

But, the quality is so bad I tossed it away. I have THE GREATEST SHOW IN EARTH and it is the best circus picture to watch. The European one should be restored with a 4k Master on Blu Ray. I would love to see that done.",1382572800,2,598,4.111111111111111
8242635,5,B0011VJRZG,"This is a great set of Video's,
Brings back a lot of fond memories of the Wonderful World of the Circus from the late 1960's",1225152000,3,124,4.0
8242636,2,B0011VJRZG,"A long-forgotten 1966 summer replacement series for ""The Red Skelton Show"" makes its way to DVD via Timeless Media Group. ""Hippodrome"" was a variety show combining performances by great musical acts of the day along with some of Europe's top circus acts.

If you are expecting complete shows, don't look to this DVD set. As always, the legal nightmare of music and performance clearances has resulted in these shows being heavily edited. All the great musical guests have been removed, leaving each show with an average running time of 24 minutes (from the original 51 minutes).

Timeless Media does get credit for even considering the release of such an obscure item from television's past, but the removal of such critical content makes it hardly worth the effort.",1210032000,12,766,5.0236220472440944
