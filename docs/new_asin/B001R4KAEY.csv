8337321,5,B001R4KAEY,"I've reviewed the other DVD already, but in case you missed it, Ruby Gloom started life in greetings cards and other merchandise before moving to animation. Only eight episodes out of the forty made are available on DVD as of writing this, four on this DVD and four more on the ""Grounded in Gloomsville"" DVD. While that DVD concentrates on the first four episodes, this DVD bounces around the series a bit, including one of my favourite episodes, the titular ""Misery Loves Company"" when Ruby surprises Misery by inviting her two cousins, Malady and Malaise, to attend a party to celebrate her anniversary of being rescued from an ice floe. The problem is that Misery's cousins are cold. Literally!

I really believe that both these DVDs are a must see. They are witty and well drawn, my only criticism is that the series hasn't merited a box set (and a decent release in my own country, thank you very much!)",1370736000,3,908,4.675

8337327,5,B001R4KAEY,"I admit I have hopped onto the Ruby Gloom Band wagon Perhaps a little too late. Because most Merchandising has been sold. but I have Net Flix to thank for introducing me to this delightful series, which has brought quiet literally the light side of the dark side to children and Adults alike. one can't help but falling in love with these quirky characters, especially Misery who's a walking Murphy's Law!",1328486400,16,405,4.71830985915493
