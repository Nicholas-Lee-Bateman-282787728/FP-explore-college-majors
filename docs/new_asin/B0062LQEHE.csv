4932785,4,B0062LQEHE,"So the movie was chilling, had it freaky moments. But I really don't believe in the date, 11.11.11. I mean today is 11.11.11 and what? I am having a good day. Maybe there is a real meaning behind this date, but so far the movies are using too much of this and too much of that. Take paranormal activity 1,2 and 3, take the doomsdays movies like 2012, anything that leads to destruction in a unique matter (like global extinction by any unbelievable reason, something that we fear of and yet did never happen to us, or our generation).  It's just too much. The way this movie depicts 11.11.11 is just unbelievable. Surely yeah there are unexplained by science things, but to believe in all that, I will not. Not a bad movie though, it was entertaining, but the end wasn't exactly the best part of the movie. No spoilers, see for yourself. Also the end is not quite having all of the answers. For instance what happened to the main ''hero''? Will I recommend the movie? Yes, get yourself a treat. Will I recommend this to people who seek answers on number 11? Actually yes, BUT remember: a) the special effects= Hollywood movie= don't expect that to happen in real life b) there are few explanations given in the movie, but don't believe everything you hear. Explore the internet yourself, search and compare. Because some information in this movie could simply be false. And just know that it's a movie. Just watch it and enjoy it. Why did I rate it 4 stars? Because it was entertaining and didn't have plenty of information on this subject (which I would love to know), too many ''creepy moments'' made for audience (too much like any other Hollywood movie. Was it original? yes and no. I would still draw connections to other movies. The only original thing in here is the use of this specific date. And finally there is another movie with almost identical name 11/11/11 (I would advice you to avoid it, it's a waste of time, cheap and very bad). Stick to this movie.",1320969600,3,1968,4.543661971830986
4932786,4,B0062LQEHE,"With a little more effort, this could've been a really great movie of this genre.  It has all the ingredients:  a tragic event sending the hero into much depressed introspection, an estranged family which is also a bit strange, a foreign locale, and odd and tragic events all associated with the dates 11-11.

A writer whose wife and son were killed by an obsessed fan returns to Barcelona to reunite with his brother and dying father. While there he comes upon various events all associated with 11-11, from the day his mother died to the date his wife and child were murdered. An online search reveals a group who believe those numbers represent a person who is a bridge between our world and another where creatures called ""angels"" but not the holy hosts we usually associate with the word are trying to come across. He's exhorted by his dying father to protect his paraplegic brother, who apparently is destined to be a ""prophet"" and save the world.

It was a good movie as far as it went but the ambivalent ending left me with questions which could've been answered had there been more exposition in the story. Some creepy moments with a definite sense of dread.",1402617600,,1167,4.650485436893204

4932788,5,B0062LQEHE,"Different and foreign great plot, keeps you guessing, and unless you are a detective you'll be amazed at the end. Well acted some quality acting screen play and directing. This director also directed  Saw 2, 3 and 4.",1396310400,,216,4.684210526315789
4932789,4,B0062LQEHE,"11-11-11 is the very low-budget, psychological horror film directed and written by Darren Lynn Bousman. When a troubled author Joseph Crone (Timothy Gibbs) goes to Spain, where his father is dying, his estranged and religious brother Samuel tries to comfort him as he begins to see 11-11 everywhere. Upon researching the topic, he discovers that the numbers are believed to coincide with 11-11-11, the date when a door will open to another realm, but where? Heaven or hell, all Joseph knows is that all these terrible events don't exactly pave the way to ultimate glory.

This was and is honestly a good movie! It's very enjoyable, different and refreshing, with the ""found-footage"" subgenre movies like the terrible Paranormal Activity saga, the even worse Chernobyl Diaries and the good sci-fi thriller Chronicle. The only true problem with the film was the script. The sad thing is, it's not Darren's fault for writing something that was sloppy in places and well-paced in others. The production was rushed because the producers didn't have much faith in the film. The acting was decent, ranging from goofy to very good. Bousman's direction was really good; the very little use CG was nice, with mainly practical effects and scares, and Joseph Bishara's score is hauntingly fantastic (you can see my review on the soundtrack's own page). Overall, 11-11-11 was a fine movie that had a great concept/plot that ended up being less than what it could have been. Still a must-see for horror fans and those who like intriguing conspiracy/race-against time-style movies. Very thrilling and creepy. Also, a Blu-Ray release would be great, distributors

4932790,5,B0062LQEHE,Here is another end of the world movie. But hey for a movie straight to dvd or limited release in theaters it was pretty good. I was impressed with the actors especially Timmothy Gibbs he did a great job. I did not expect it to end the way it did. This was a pretty good film. The director did a good job.

4932792,3,B0062LQEHE,"I have to be frank here.  I watched this movie about a month ago when it arrived.  I didn't remember anything about the movie while trying to write this review so I read the other reviews.  They refreshed my memory enough to say that it wasn't memorable, 23 was a much better movie, & I may or may not ever watch it again.  Just saying!  Would I recommend this?  Not so much.  I don't think I would even recommend this as a rental.  It was alright so I give it 3 stars.",1360368000,2,469,4.021739130434782

4932794,3,B0062LQEHE,"After seeing it advertised as being from the Director of SAW 2,3 and 4 I was truly looking forward to the this movie. What a letdown. It was just OK. The same kind of feeling I get from most Stephen King or m night shyamalan movies. It is not bad, but something is missing all around. Had a decent ending but again, all around you had the feeling something was missing. Just not exciting or scary except for a few parts mostly delivered with shock noise to boost effect. I could not recommend this to anyone.",1344038400,,508,4.302083333333333
4932795,1,B0062LQEHE,5 minutes in I was like... wtf? Then 20 minutes in I was bored. 45 minutes in I felt as if I was wasting my time so I cut it off.,1344038400,2,129,3.193548387096774
4932796,3,B0062LQEHE,"Remember the Jim Carrey bomb THE NUMBER 23?  No?  Well, 11-11-11 is similar in its numerical theme.  I find it more interesting than its bigger budget predecessor, although 11-11-11 is by no means a great picture.
Set in Spain, the movie's biggest downfall is its poor lighting.  Darren Bausman (whose MOTHER'S DAY I just saw the night before) directs with little imagination and little true suspense.
The sometime incoherent plot focuses on a popular thriller novelist who finds that all the tragedies in his life involve the numbers 11/11 in some way.  News of his father's impending death leads him to Spain, where his cleric brother is confined to a wheelchair.  Soon clues regarding the Biblical reference to the numbers leads him to a final devilish confrontation.
The film's pacing is a tad lethargic and the performances of Timothy Gibbs as the author and Michael Landes as his brother are adequate but not remarkable.  It's hard to believe this film was helmed by the same director who did 3 films in the SAW franchise or the much better MOTHER'S DAY.
Fans of THE OMEN may enjoy, but I suggest a rental rather than a purchase.",1342310400,2,1135,4.78974358974359

4932798,2,B0062LQEHE,"This is another movie where the trailer made it look like there's a lot of action/creepy things going on, but the action that was there happened mainly at the end.  It was random and confusing.  There is a twist to the movie which was its only saving grace.  Terrible.",1336953600,3,268,4.428571428571429
4932799,3,B0062LQEHE,"The actors in this film are quite good. The script, not so much for a while at least, until it finally gets going and you find out more about what the prophecy is all about.",1336867200,,173,3.9714285714285715
4932800,5,B0062LQEHE,"This is a movie that is complex and is discoverable through the director's commentary. I found it not to be SAW but a reality based feature that requires more than one viewing. The director would have you disregard the pre-distribution of the movie last year. This movie is edited well and is 97 minutes instead of 90 minutes. All I can say is that I am glad that I did not see the original version before it was mixed in post. I give it five stars because it flows very well. I enjoyed the acting, the location, and the extras.",1336089600,2,528,4.29
4932801,3,B0062LQEHE,"Beautifully produced, well cast and atmospheric film makes the mistake of being a little too predictable. If you've seen films like The Omen, you start to suspect early on that it's the ones you least suspect who turn out to be the bad guy. I caught the plentiful hints early on in this film and my hunch was correct. By the time the climactic reveal came, i felt a little cheated.",1335830400,2,381,4.380281690140845
4932802,5,B0062LQEHE,"This movie was awesome. My girlfriend and I sat down and watched this last night. It was creepy and has a nice twist at the end. The demons looked pretty freaky, worth all 5 stars in my book. Check it out, I am sure you will not be disappointed.",1335744000,3,245,4.020408163265306
4932803,3,B0062LQEHE,"I was pretty skeptical about this movie mainly because everything I had heard about it was negative. I, however, like to give movies the benefit of the doubt. I was pleasantly surprised when I sat down and watched this film. In this case the saying ""never judge a book by its cover"" is very fitting. I won't go into details of the premise since you can read that in the description but for the most part the acting was pretty good. Michael Lands who played Joseph's brother was a little over-the-top at times but I think part of this problem might have come more from the script than the actor. The premise of the story is very intriguing and there were quite a few moments that had me unnerved. Anything involving demons is terrifying to me and this was no exception. I also liked that this film was subtle on effects and not ridden with over-the-top CGI or gore. It was more about the slow burn and characterization, kind of in the vein of such classics as The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. I'll take Supernatural/Psychological Horror over Slasher/gore any day. Is this a done deal? Definitely not, the film suffers from an uneven flow at times and the script could have used some fine-tuning. All quibbles aside, in my humble opinion this was not a terrible film. Definitely worth a rental, at least, but for how cheap the retail price is you could waste your hard-earned cash on a lot worse.

4932804,4,B0062LQEHE,"""The day that Sarah & David died so did my faith that there was some sort of higher power."" Joesph Crone is an author trying to deal with the loss of his wife and child. After getting a call from his brother he travels to Spain to see him and his dying father. When the date and time of 11:11 keeps showing up in his life he wonders if it has meaning. I will start by saying that I actually did like this movie. I also have to say that it is still a high class B movie though. The best way to describe this is that it is a little better and scarier version of ""Number 23"". If you like that movie you will like this one. The movie deals with some very religious issues and makes you wonder who is right and what is real. The movie rode the line of serious and cheesy the whole time. Stepping over to the cheesy side more often but still I liked it. There really isn't much else to say about this one but for any hardcore horror fans this is a good one to watch. For everyone else I will say I liked it, but don't go in expecting a great movie. Overall, a movie that I enjoyed and fans of ""Number 23"" will love. I give it a B+.",1328918400,12,1125,3.8956521739130436
4932805,4,B0062LQEHE,"Joseph Crone (Timothy Gibbs) is a famous author who writes thriller novels. He tragically loses his wife and child in a fire...one where we see the shadow of an angel in the background. Joseph takes medication and has joined a support group for emotional help. He continues to write in a journal. Joseph himself is almost killed in a car accident (on 11-8-11) but is miraculously spared. His watch is broken at 11:11.

Joseph gets a call from his brother in Barcelona. Dad only has a few more days to live. Joseph flies out on 11/9/11. He gets constant warnings of impending doom from creepy old people. His brother Samuel (Michael Landes) is confined to a wheel chair. Joseph has lost his faith, something that is reflected in his character. In Spain there are weird things going on. The house has cameras installed. The elderly housekeeper thinks it is demons. Joseph has noticed the coincidence of the number 11:11 appearing in his life and tragedy striking...and we are now headed toward 11/11/11!!!!

Gibbs and Landes subject us to a constant barrage of boring monotone dialouge early in the film. Later Joseph, the skeptic, becomes excited. The special effects are low budget, but worked. I enjoyed the twist at the end. It set up for a sequel. I am dying to compare this to other films, but making any comparison would spoil it for the viewer.

8491200,2,B0062LQEHE,"11-11-11 was pretty good until it got preachy. When the hero ""found his faith"", the movie lost me.  Can't we have straight-up horror without religious undertones?  It's a shame, since the script had a decent start. But the plot just runs out of steam and loses allure.

WARNING: SPOILERS:  Joe is a major skeptic/atheist who scoffs at the idea of demons or praying to the ""old man in the sky"". He  begins to notice a certain number sequence 11-11 repeating. Rather than considering the most sensible explanation: that it's a very easy combination to remember and thus more noticeable, he assigns the pattern supernatural significance.

So what does our sensible and skeptical hero do? He consults the most ""scholarly"" of sources: the internet, where every wacko with a smartphone has a world-wide audience of chumps. Perhaps the Alex Jones types have left me jaded. As the story became increasingly far-fetched, the writers neglect to ramp up the tension.  If you don't buy the ""demons are responsible for the evil in the world"" line, you're left adrift.",1456617600,,1054,4.954545454545454
