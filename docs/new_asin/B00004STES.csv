8200818,5,B00004STES,"This is by far the lowest budget, lowest quality movie series I have ever seen, and that's what makes it fantastic. The plot alone is enough to make someone double over with laughter! The main character, White Tiger (in the first movie) is a pimp and is worried because a rival Japanese whorehouse has just opened up down the street. He later finds out that he is the son of royalty and starts training to be a ninja. The special effects are laughable, the plot is bad, the first movie repeats an entire scene for no reason, the second movie plays a half-hour of the first movie within it, the over-dubbed dialogue is absolutely hilarious (whether it's supposed to be or not, I'm not sure). If you have some extra money and are looking for a good laugh with some decent martial arts thrown in, Ninja Death is the movie for you. If you're looking for quality entertainment with decent actors and a coherent plot, do NOT buy this movie!",1074297600,,934,4.5
