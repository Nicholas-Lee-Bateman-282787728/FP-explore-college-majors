8055582,2,B00083ZQC6,"So first of all, its a copy of the Baby Einstein videos, sort of takes ideas from many of them and puts them all in on DVD with hindi words spoken in the background. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I take away points for lack of any original ideas. Also, the music ideas are taken from the Baby Einstien videos, might have been nice to have Indian Instrumental music in the background instead of western classical!

And then, there is this long nasal intoning of the words. Like ""paaaani"" or ""chaaaaaand"" which isn't really how we pronounce the words. I understand that words needs to be spoken slowly for kids to understand them, but the video takes it a bit beyond the reasonable!

And finally, the grammar is wrong in various places, especially when talking about 1 and many. E.g. she says something like ""nau gaadi"" ( 9 cars in hindi) which isn't right - needs to be ""Nau gadiyan"". I may not have the example exactly right, but you get the idea.

All that said, my son does like to watch it, but I worry that it isn't teaching him the language correctly. And I suspect he watches because its a lot like the Baby Einstein videos he loves.

So, I'd say pass on this, teach your kids hindi yourself if you can!",1182470400,15,1220,4.384955752212389
8055583,4,B00083ZQC6,"It is a decent movie. It introduces Hindi to young children well. It is mildly entertaining and is helpful for counting and such. Probably best for kids under 5. Also, the music is loud, and the voice not terribly clear, so it is a good idea to watch it with you kids and say the words for them too (not just have them watch it idly). It helped me introduce Hindi to my kids (husband is Indian, I'm not) which they probably wouldn't get much of otherwise.",1181779200,,455,4.241379310344827
8055584,5,B00083ZQC6,"This DVD is extremely well made, the best and most professional Hindi learning product for small kids. Has taught my 2-year old lots of Hindi words... The style is based upon the super-popular English Baby Einstein series, and it definitely lives up to the standards that the Baby Einstein series is known for.",1178323200,,310,4.867924528301887
8055585,5,B00083ZQC6,"This is an excellent dvd for kids,my kids love watching it over and over again. There should be a part 2  also. This is a great gift for kids.",1176163200,,142,3.896551724137931
8055586,4,B00083ZQC6,"I can understand what the previous poster is saying about the volume.  Being a non-Hindi speaker, I realized from my husband(Hindi speaker), that I was saying some of the words wrong.  It is hard at times to make out what is being said.

On the other side, I think it is a perfect dvd for children under 3.  It is modeled after the ""Baby Einstein"" dvds.  My baby is 11 months old and loves watching other children and babies.  So, it is a perfect way to hold her attention as she listens to Hindi.  She is starting to use some of the words  and sounds.  So, in that way, I think this DVD is very educational and helpful.",1173830400,,620,4.186440677966102
8055587,1,B00083ZQC6,This movie is a rip off.  The background music is loud and at times its hard to hear the real audio.  Even the narrators voice is soft.  Its a total waste of money. My kids watched this once only and showed no interest at all.  This video is not creative and has poor presentation.  Badly done.  Kids don't need that.  I recommend some Barney or Elmo movie than this.  This movie is of a poor quality compared to some other kids language movie.,1171411200,,444,4.265060240963855
8055588,5,B00083ZQC6,"My kids had been resisting learning their mother tounge from their

mother, so I got this DVD. I must say that I am surprised at how much

my kids love this  video, even my seven year old. We have had it for 7 days

now. They have asked for it 6 times in these 7 days, and they have picked

up most of the words. There should be a part II, with sentence construction.

I would buy it!",1170806400,2,384,3.858974358974359
8055589,5,B00083ZQC6,"My daughter started watching this DVD when she was 1 1/2 yr old. She is 2 now and this is still one of favorites. The quality of DVD is superb! She has definitely picked up many Hindi words from this DVD. Infact, not just her but my older daughter who is 7 yr old also learnt many words from this DVD. And some of the video clips just make my younger daughter laugh. I am looking forward to more of such good quality kids Hindi DVDs.",1120867200,,433,4.046511627906977
8055590,5,B00083ZQC6,"I do know Hindi, but not well enough to teach it to my kids.  This has been a great way to introduce the language and get my kids (and me!) interested in learning more.

My five year old picked up the words, numbers, and colors pretty fast several months ago, and she was able to say simple phrases on her own.  My two year old is very interested in the DVD, and recently he started counting to ten in Hindi after watching it!

It's a quality product and features a lot of bright, colorful objects and kids.  I think kids like to see other kids who look like them, so that's always a plus and not something you see very often (at least not outside of India!).

I hope there's a sequel!!",1113696000,,686,4.159090909090909
8055591,5,B00083ZQC6,"I am a first generation Indian-Americian so while I understand Hindi, I am unable to speak enough for my son to pick it up form me.  This DVD has been really great - I bought it for him when he was 18 months old and still at 2 and a half he still gets excited to watch it.  I am excited that he is able to include Hindi in his vocabulary.",1113696000,,338,3.7464788732394365
