8408005,1,B003XF1VE8,"Or time on this turkey. I rented this movie because I'm a fan of both, Alex Cord and Samantha Eggar. But, even these two talented actors couldn't make this amateurish and ill written piece of tripe worth watching. In fact, I have to confess, I didn't watch most of the film, it was too tedious to wade through.",1348099200,2,310,4.362068965517241
8408006,1,B003XF1VE8,"This review is about the quality of the dvd from Sinister Cinema not the film itself.  First the bad news about the dvd. The source print used for this transfer was in pretty bad shape in spots. There is occasionally a green line running down the center and sides of the film. Also, there is a green hair jumping around in the lower left-hand corner. Throughout the film, scratches, blemishes, and pixelation. There appears to be many jumps, and certain places where it feels as if parts of the movie are missing. Since I have never seen the movie before I don't know if anything is missing or cut out of it. Run time is about 101 minutes from watching the clock on the movie itself.  There is no mention of the run time on the box or even a description of what the movie itself is about, just a description about Sinister Cinema. The picture appears to be in widescreen, but doesn't fill up my tv screen like a normal widescreen picture normally does. The picture only fills in about one half to 3/4's of my screen like it was shrunken to fit a 20 to 25 inch widescreen tv. From reading other reviews and dvd versions about this movie it sounds a lot like the same dvd quality of the Eurovista dvd version since it has a lot of the same problems possibly they both used the same source material or bad VHS tape.  This is also a dvd-r from Sinister Cinema, who knows if they have the real film rights when they put this out.  There is a bonus feature a trailer for what I am guessing is another dvd from Sinister Cinema.  The quality of the trailer was better than for the feature film itself.

Now for the good news, I didn't pay alot for this Sinister Cinema dvd it was $8.99 new from Amazon.  If all you just want to see is the movie and don't care so much about the quality this is the cheap way to go.  Especially if you don't want to pay $30-40 bucks for the Code Red OOP dvd version of the movie.",1337299200,10,1903,4.223140495867769
