8410450,4,B003ZJ956I,Funny take-off on blaxploitation detective films. This was overlooked when originally released in the mid-70's and Scorpion Entertainment delivers a beautiful uncut widescreen print of this little-seen film. Worth the purchase.,1404864000,,227,6.354838709677419
8410451,5,B003ZJ956I,"Absolutely funny!!! This movie had scenes that made my stomach hurt from laughing. It is truly one of the funniest 70's blaxploitation movie's I've ever seen. Ridiculously stupid but funny. I will say this... The movie's opening scene was kinda cool with the 70's ghetto dialogue but other then that the movie started off slow but it was well worth the wait. To me, this is A MUST buy for those who like 1970's blaxploitation movies. Get ready to laugh your a** off!!",1314057600,,467,4.63855421686747
