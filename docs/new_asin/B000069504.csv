1729743,4,B000069504,This DVD is broken down into 3 parts. He talks about what we eat and how bad sugar is for you and how good greens are. He talks about the value of exercise and a positive attitude.  Nothing new here. It's a good video to watch from time to time to remind us that we are in control of our bodies and health and have to take some responsibility for how we treat ourselves. Interesting to watch.

Eat right and relax is the basic message of the seminar. It is worth watching if you need to re-center yourself, I took some notes while watching it to make some basic guidelines for myself. When he says ""Food isn't meant to make you feel good, its meant to be good for you,"" my girlfriend quit watching. Way too many ugly old people in the audience too... this is kinda an old folks video. But at 10 bucks its not too awful.",1180137600,2,571,4.447619047619048
1729745,5,B000069504,"This documentary/seminar is an excellent discussion of how nearly EVERYONE is killing themselves prematurely. Then it provides realistic solutions for stress, exercise, and diet.

Indeed, Gary makes a good case that we are killing ourselves off...even halving our lives (thus the 150 potential life span).

And if the idea of this documentary giving you 75 more years, what if it just gives you one more year. Wouldn't that be worth viewing it?",1143590400,9,444,5.152777777777778

I believe this movie may have done something for me that I would have never guessed from the outset - it made living as long as possible (within my control) not seem quite so important. But rather it made the idea of living with joy in the present seem to be a much better goal. Things I might implement in my life having watched this movie: taking a Sabbath rest, continuing to try to avoid a stroke in order to give me a better quality of life (exercise, weights, diet), enjoying the life I now have with my family - embrace the idea of que sera, sera - whatever will be, will be...",1409616000,,632,4.146341463414634

1729935,5,B000069504,"What's interesting about this movie is that it inspires people to live longer but the secret is yet to be determined.  What is quite apparent is your genetic make-up has a great deal to do with how long you live.  It seems as remaining active and think positively about turning old has a great deal to do with extending one's life.
It will be interesting to see what science will continue to do to extend our lives.",1394841600,,415,4.376623376623376

1729938,5,B000069504,"This was a great doc. It really got me thinking about the world we live in now. As a healer, and for ever curious student of life and her infinite mysteries. We are living in times people from back in the day wrote about. Why not live forever or pick your departure date. To live to be like 500 and have the energy of a 50 or 40 year old. Why not!!?? Sounds sci fi right?  Few people talk about that.

I say this because I am reading and studying a  book on healing and immortality. It called Tao II: The Way of Healing, Rejuvenation, Longevity, and Immortality. We can heal our bodies. Oncne that is done we rejuvenate and transform and  evolve. No only does Dr. Sha talk about immortality he shows you how.

I know life and death go together but to learn that there is beyond life and death that the two can meld is kind of cool. Like I said we are living in sci fi times. The internet was written about, now we are are users of it. Why not immortality.",1393459200,,955,4.112903225806452

1729976,4,B000069504,This is an excellent documentary on modern aging. I think the conclusion at the end is right on as well.,1390867200,,104,4.25
1729977,3,B000069504,"Overall, fairly amusing.  Worth watching once. Obviously a lot went into this, as many very old people are interviewed , including quite a few in Japan b/c they are exceptionally long-lived, second only to Icelanders, the segment for which comes at the end and abruptly ends w/o any interviews or theories as to why they live so long there--odd.  You should basically take away that food and exercise--BTW, regarding the latter, there's no consensus that regimented, aerobic type is better than just staying fairly active, big surprise--aren't as important as attitude and looking fwd to something as much as possible.  I'll just say at the risk of sounding prudish and discriminatory that, although  few phony PC types might proclaim it even life affirming and inspiring, the scene w/ the 74-year-old porn actor and the old woman, which was really unexpected as the rest of the movie is OK for general audiences, is bound to gross out many if not most people, and there's some nudity in that and explicit geriatric sex shown on the porn box covers that might give some folks trauma/nightmares/episodes of retching.  There were also a couple or so characters that were hard to believe, like the one pictured on the cover, who I thought was Will Ferrell in disguise.  He's the one who's supposed to be over 100 while doing full marathons while drinking beer and smoking. OK.",1390521600,4,1373,4.896551724137931
1729978,5,B000069504,"My husband and I didn't know what to watch, but we wanted to watch a documentary.  This was perfect, because it was not too serious of a subject.  They made getting old not depressing.",1389657600,,184,4.382352941176471
1729979,3,B000069504,"Didn't really answer the question, but gave some interesting views of getting older.  The main theme of living 600 more years had some interesting replies.  Not a riveting movie.",1389398400,,178,5.103448275862069

1730021,4,B000069504,Interesting. Peoples opinion and views and remidies to a longer and happy life. Seems to get boring. In my opinion.,1384387200,,115,4.8
1730022,4,B000069504,"I must say, this film isn't what I expected. I thought from the title and cover that this would be about how to live a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer, instead it's more about the mental aspect of aging and death! This ""documentary"" follows men and women in their 20s and up who are sharing their overcoming battles of living a fulfilled life. This movie becomes relatable to anyone regardless of age because aging and death is a fact of life and many of us have trouble managing our time to make it the most worthy to look back on. Topics in this film include exercising, hormone treatment, cryogenics...but what's really interesting is how the lifestyle of one person may allow them to live to over 100 years old and yet that same lifestyle for someone else may only allow them to live to 70.
I would recommend watching this movie with a group or class as it's a great conversation starter especially when gathering different people's perspective on the topic. (Such as: if there was a pill that allowed you to live 500 years, would you take it?)",1384214400,2,1058,4.544502617801047

1730024,5,B000069504,We've so congested our lives with such shallow entertainment options that we've forgotten how real life is so much more entertaining.  Great documentary.  I'd watch this again at least once a month to refresh my mind with the information provided in this documentary.,1382313600,,267,5.186046511627907
1730025,4,B000069504,"Minus the sneak attack senior porn scenes, this documentary was pretty interesting to watch. It gave a broad spectrum of people's thoughts on what they think contributes to a longer life and then the viewer can take away what they want from it.  But those scenes of the two senior porn stars were totally out of left field in the documentary and we both turned to each other and said what the heck was the maker of the documentary thinking by putting those in. I think it would have been entirely more fitting and beneficial to include a couple people (even the old porno couple) talking about how they think sex and orgasm leads to longevity, not the in your face nude porn scenes between the two old people. I can't get the images out of my head now, not for lack of trying!
If you are looking for a documentary on scientific, specific proven things to help people live longer...this isn't it. But those types of documentaries are usually proven wrong eventually anyway so we found it more interesting to watch various theories on it and to think for ourselves what we thought helps and what doesn't.",1382227200,,1102,4.565656565656566
1730026,4,B000069504,"How to Live Forever is not so much a guide on longevity as it is an overview of other persons lives who have approached or surpassed the century mark. Some of the stories are interesting while others, like the old farts on the cover, are annoying at best. What's the point of including some crotchety, cantankerous old curmudgeon who drinks, smokes and gets all snippy when being questioned? Great, some people are genetically wired to do anything they want in life and still survive. That's hardly a roadmap for longevity for the rest of us.

The takeaway from this movie is more about enjoying your life and the people you love than actually presenting much useful information on how to do so. It's worth watching, but I wouldn't make it a priority.",1378771200,,751,4.6893939393939394
1730027,2,B000069504,"I had to skip around because the pacing was slow, the content was weak at times, and the production value was relatively sub par.

1730061,5,B000069504,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary and watched it a second time with my husband. We are in our early 70s and the message was uplifting. There were practical points that we already know and many new ideas that we will incorporate into our lives and relationships. The difference between Japan where everyone is stressed out and I think it was Denmark - was very enlightening. I wish this would be shown on regular TV and to our health care industry.

We Americans have really taken a wrong turn in quality of life and need to readjust our lifestyle. We've forgotten that the goal is to enjoy the journey. This is what this documentary is really all about -- moving away from the distractions and embracing the love and joy of relationship and peace that is possible.",1372550400,,768,4.647058823529412

We all have thought about it one time or another, but this film puts a different spin on the whole thing.  There's a lot of truths wrapped in humor and sauced with life lessons in this film, that makes this a pleasure watch.",1368230400,,315,4.064516129032258
1730064,4,B000069504,"A lot of the ground here is covered elsewhere, but that didn't diminish my enjoyment of watching this documentary. There are some remarkable old people profiled in this film, which, for me at least, are the highlights.

1730103,5,B000069504,"I loved this film because it addressed a very normal, human fear of simple decline.  Ray Bradbury let us in on his fear of aging, especially as it had been exacerbated by his Moms recent passing and his new status of becoming 50 years old. He travels the globe in search of what aging and the secret of longevity is all about and he finds, as expected, it is different for everyone. We also are reminded that we do have control over our quality of life through understanding, acceptance, resilience, attitude and being true to our interests or passions.  I think everyone should catch a glimpse of a film like this every now and again to be reminded to get on with it...  looking back is not nearly as productive as looking forward.

1730105,2,B000069504,"I enjoy documentaries. I thought this was very fascinating. That was until the last moments when the pornography entered the scene. That was really unnecessary. I guess people have a desire for filth that they cannot quench. You can't even watch something that should be harmless without filth popping up.

The context is that a man was into doing elderly pornography. Ok, we understand what that means. We did not need a graphic scene to demonstrate the point. It was gratuitous and I turned off the film at that point. What a way to cheapen what was turning out to be quite informational.

People with low moral fiber will not be bothered by this because it is seen as normal. That is fine. This review is not for you. This is to give the heads up for those who do not appreciate filling their minds with garbage.",1361232000,21,815,4.537414965986395

Nothing lasts forever and anything to excess is good for nothing. If we, humans, think we can live forever, then our certain demise is sealed.

1730190,5,B000069504,"From director Mark Wexler I expected funny and entertaining and quirky.  ""How to Live Forever"" is so much more than that.  From the very first scene, in which Wexler goes to visit Edna Parker, the oldest living person at 115, we are aware that the dark, devolution of aging will subtend whatever else the film promises to offer on the longevity front.  Edna appears beyond this world, her tiny frame wrapped in a gauzy robe and propped in her wheelchair.  Her sunken eyes remain expressionless as the cheery nursing home staff loudly announces Wexler's visit.  She is unmoved by his friendly display of interest in her.  We can't help but feel the discomfort of their disconnect.  What is actually happening here?  Might it be nothing more than voyeurism?  Right when discomfort gets to be the main character, the scene shifts.  Over and over the film proceeds this way, cutting from one speaker to another just after we begin to squirm, or laugh, or sink, or cry.

You can't just watch ""How to Live Forever"" because the very topic requires participation.  Wexler transparently models  our assumptions, defenses, and  uncertainties about the unassailable fact of our own demise.  We can keep a distance perhaps when he's being  gingerly hoisted into a casket by a ""body scoop"" demonstrated at a Las Vegas morticians' trade show (he's a corpse with a little smile), but his furtive measurement of midriff flab in a fast bathroom scene, or his earnest queries at a San Francisco Brain Gym lend a disarming intimacy to the wealth of attitudes and info the film presents us.

Inevitably we are drawn in by the diversity and richness of the film's speakers--each is presented with a ticker counting up his/her age--and their particular cultural and historical contexts.  I hope to remember forever the story of Jeanne Calment, the French woman who took up fencing at 85, long before she died at 122, and the film's poster boy, Buster Martin, who at 101 is doing the London marathon, smoking, drinking, and making hit rock band recordings, and especially Eleanor Wasson, my favorite, who at age 100 beautifully articulates her lifelong work for peace in the context of such diverse accomplishments as flying ferry ships in World War II and writing a book entitled ""Twenty Eight Thousand Martinis,"" based on her personal practice of drinking one martini a day.  Of course there are lots of luminaries here too, and they each offer a provocative angle--John Robbins, Marianne Williamson, Jack LaLanne (my other favorite), Suzanne Somers, Ray Bradbury--as do people on the street who respond variously to the question ""If there was a pill to live for 500 years, would you take it?""

As for the philosophical questions the film raises--Is the quest for longevity just 21st century narcissism?  Will nanobots interacting with humans neurologically deliver us to the theater of radical life extension? Will the creation of the ageless society dwarf the age of the computer? to name just a few--""How to Live Forever""  is full and fast paced enough to give us a sense of the possibilities, if not the answers.  For this reason I suspect I'll be drawn to watch this film many more times.  An added pleasure is the soundtrack, which is beautifully matched to the sequences, never overly obvious but always nuanced and compelling.  And finally the haunting credit art, by Wexler's mother, Marian, is especially poignant.  But you'll have to see the film to find out why.",1339632000,9,3453,4.930795847750865
1730191,5,B000069504,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, but was delighted that it hit home on so many levels. For a generation contemplating our own mortality, the title certainly is a hook. But this is no dry doco, or how-to. Instead, director Wexler takes us through a quixotic assortment of folks who have beaten the clock in one way or the other, and shares their personal stories, and the universal truths they contain. With a journalist's instinct, Wexler tracks down a delightful assortment of elder statesmen, from the indefatigable Jack LaLanne, to a beer guzzling, cigarette-smoking, marathon-running centenarian (my personal hero). Along the way, you sense that the filmmaker is very concerned with his own mortality, but never loses the sense of irony that makes this movie so watchable (I almost never watch a film more than once, and I'm on my third viewing) and never descends into sentimentality or easy answers.",1337644800,28,917,5.0

1730193,5,B000069504,"Mark Wexler's  wonderful documentary ""How to Live Forever"" is a funny, surprising and thoughtful exploration of life's third act. The curious, down-to-earth Wexler asks a lot of great questions of both ordinary and extraordinary people -- from a 94 year old practicing heart surgeon to cryonics patrons, from preachers to elder porn stars. Woven throughout the film are some of the leading voices on the study of aging, along with writers Marianne Williamson, Ray Bradbury, Suzanne Somers and his very zen friend Pico Iyer.

A few of the interviews he did stayed with me long after leaving the theater. For example, the high school teacher who encourages her teenage students to put rocks in their shoes and smear Vaseline on their glasses to teach them empathy for their elders and the Ms. Senior America pageant that made us laugh, cheer, and cry. The joie de vivre of Ms. Senior Arkansas, her outlook and optimistic approach to life are truly inspiring. It's not about retiring, it's about refiring!",1335830400,3,1002,4.994011976047904

By interweaving lots of interesting and quirky characters with his own personal angst about his own aging body, Wexler asks all the right questions. Questions we all want answers to. The film demonstrates a balance so hard to achieve in documentary: Very informative on an important and serious subject, and all the while, purely enjoyable to watch.",1335225600,4,613,4.738317757009346

This gem of a film gives us the cutting-edge science of futurist Ray Kurzweil, the wisdom of author Marianne Williamson, and the genius of science fiction legend Ray Bradbury, alongside more controversial voices like a 101 year old chain-smoking marathoner and an elder porn star. Wexler works out with fitness legend Jack LaLanne, contemplates a future on ice at a cryonics lab, laughs with comedienne Phyllis Diller, drinks gallons of green tea, and extracts promises of immortality from life-extension expert Aubrey de Grey, but draws a blank when asked by his friend, writer Pico Iyer, the actual merits of simply wanting more. It is the ultimate question, and one the director sagely leaves to the viewer. After all, as the subtitle warns us, results may vary.",1334102400,6,1034,5.088235294117647
