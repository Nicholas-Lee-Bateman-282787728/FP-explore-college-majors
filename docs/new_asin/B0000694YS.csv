7965087,2,B0000694YS,"A really weird, dreamlike ""fairy tale"" horror film with occasional splashes of gore. Not my favorite Fulci film and it probably won't be yours. But I'm glad to have it in my collection, and I'll definitely watch it again. Why? It's a great Shriek Show release; cover art is simple and sleek, transfer is remarkable for being filmed in soft focus, and the cast interviews are a real treat. Plus, I'm a Fulci completist with a dark, dusty, coffin-shaped place in my heart for the man's later works. I love The New York Ripper and Demonia. I like Cat in the Brain, Voices from Beyond, and even Manhattan Baby! That said, please believe me when I tell you that Sweet House of Horrors stinks on nearly every level. By all means, see for yourself. But it's poorly scripted, directed, acted, and filmed, and I can easily declare it the worst Fulci film I've ever seen. That's saying something.

How bad is it? Well, for one, it's no secret that Fulci was endlessly impatient and harsh toward many of his actors especially child actors. For being such a prolific filmmaker, the irony of his poor attitude toward colleagues was that it was the antithesis of directing. You can't pull a worthy performance out of someone if you don't even have the patience to communicate with them. Unfortunately, Sweet House is centered around two kid performances. Two kids who can't act. Two kids who were not only tasked with carrying the film, but are burdened with the most ineptly-written dialogue in ANY Fulci film. The dialogue is infected with shameless exposition and lifeless exchanges.

Another blow to the film is how the ""ghosts"" are depicted. They aren't ghoulish undead things shuffling through dark hallways. They aren't transparent spirits who howl in the night or stand over you while you sleep. Nope, not in the least. Instead, the dead parents of the kids are two small flames who float around the house calling out in awkward, high pitched voices. They're about as terrifying as a Halloween-themed No. 2 pencil. To Fulci's credit, the ghosts are meant to be more lighthearted than scary. Another weakness worth mentioning is the climax. Trust me, there's nothing to spoil here, folks. The movie, devoid of any real build-up or suspense, coalesces in a ""supernaturally-influenced"" tractor spinning around in circles, as the villainous medium with a bad German accent runs around in circles flailing his arms in the air. If it wasn't for the Lino Salemme interview (extras) where he describes Fulci as being a screaming jerk to everyone on set, I'd seriously doubt the maestro even showed up. Virtually all of the legendary style and characteristics we love about Fulci are absent in this picture.

The film does have a half-interesting history; it is one of two made-for-TV horror films Fulci did for Italian series ""Houses of Doom"", the second being the superior (but mostly underwhelming) House of Clocks. In the end, the TV producers decided the films were too violent for the masses, so neither film ever aired. Bad thing? Who cares, the DVD release is awesome. Chalk it up to yet another time in horror history when Fulci's art was shut down or censored by the industry.

Despite being a string of flaws and failed attempts at fairy tale story-telling, it's still an interesting little walk through the lesser-known alleyways of Lucio Land. There's a couple moments of glorious gore, most notably in the opening scene when a masked intruder brutally bashes the eyeballs and faces of the parents during a home invasion turned double homicide. Later, the intruder meets his own fate under the weight and crush of a bus / dog attack. Classic Fulci. Don't expect a cascade of gore though; that element is replaced by an almost-lighthearted dreamy weirdness never seen again in Fulci's work (thank God).

Extras include: 4 short-but-sweet cast interviews, 4 trailers for Shriek Show's other Italian horror releases, and some liner notes that read like a half-hearted attempt to convince disappointed viewers that the subpar film they just saw really does have redeeming qualities. And indeed, it does. Where it lacks in direction, it delivers in weird atmosphere, silly characters, supernatural weirdness, and a half-decent score.",1461628800,,4226,4.963276836158192
7965088,5,B0000694YS,This movie is part of a Italian made for TV series with three others.  This one by far is the wierdest but that is Italian cinema.,1365984000,,130,4.0
7965089,4,B0000694YS,"Not one of Fulci's best by a long shot, but it does have a place in any Fulci fan's or gorehound's collection.  Minimal plot, but good use of special effects.",1358294400,,158,4.266666666666667
7965090,3,B0000694YS,"People keep comparing it to other Lucio flicks but I liked it because it wasn't like the other Fulci flicks. One person on another site said it best calling it a fairy tale. It's a fairy tale but with dark overtones.
Still I really thought it was decent. Sort of like a ""Tales of the Darkside"" type of atmosphere with the parents being killed then coming back as ghosts and speaking to the kids (who are the only ones that see them while the relatives think they're nuts).

Acting was ok. There's even a few comedy moments in the film (guy's hand melting and the crane that has a mind of it's own, the old man whose a psychic, conjurer whatever he is confronting the spirits.

I think if you're in for a different type of movie from the director this is worth looking at. For me it's a type of love story that expands even through death.",1182902400,5,837,4.291139240506329
7965091,5,B0000694YS,"Don't be so easily put off by the critics! THIS IS NOT A TYPICAL FILM OF FULCI. If you are looking for THE BEYOND look elsewhere.

Imagine a kids film from the viewpoint of children laced with strong grahic violence with a surreal dream like quality and an underlying sadistic theme of revenge.

I have seen just over 30 of Fulci's films and this would be in my top 5. Don't miss it !",1162166400,9,384,4.175675675675675
7965092,2,B0000694YS,"I cant believe Lucio Fulci made this film, its with out a doubt  his worst movie ever. The only good part is when the guy robbing the home gets his throat sliced. The whole movie I waited for Gore or action or something and it never came and that was dissapointing. Check it out if you find it for $5-$10 and $10 is to much but, its Fulci so I will keep it in my collection. A great Fulci flick is Zombi and The Beyond along with 2 more decent flicks being ""house by the cemetary"" and ""City Of the Living Dead."" but all 4 are worth the buy well to me atlest",1110067200,2,557,3.9292035398230087
7965093,1,B0000694YS,"By far and away the WORST Lucio Fulci movie ever made. Luckily for me I rented this movie before I decided to add it to my collection. The description of the movie made it sound interesting enough to rent and being a big fan of the Fulci trademark movies I thought it would be pretty good. Sweet house of horrors has none of the trademark Fulci gore which was quite a let down not to the mention the movie is just absolutely a waste of time. By this point in his career I think Fulci just ran out of ideas and threw this together witout much effort. Even the trademark eyeball scene was sub par at best.

If you're a ""HUGE"" fan of Lucio Fulci and haven't seen this film I recommend strongly that you rent it first. If your looking for a good Fulci movie may I suggest ""Zombie"" or ""The Beyond"". Don't waste your time with this unimaginative, dull, pointless film. It's really that bad!",1104883200,6,884,4.293413173652695
7965094,1,B0000694YS,"being a huge fan of lucio fulci,bought this to add to collection of his other dvds that i owned,bad mistake. The storyline is poor,and frankly is the worst he has ever made,no gore really apart from beginning,just a stupid idea.avoid it at all costs.",1050019200,3,250,4.704545454545454
