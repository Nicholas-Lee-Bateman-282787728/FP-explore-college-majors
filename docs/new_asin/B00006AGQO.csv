You witness all that the four seasons bring to this charming garden and its creatures: snow, ice, buds, blossoms, wild storms, and quiet solitude. The creatures include: bugs, frogs, one snake, ducks, geese, fish, a cat, and a couple of dogs.  You see in time-lapse photography the frozen garden ""waking up from winter"" with the melting of pond ice, the opening of buds, and the re-sprouting of all things green. What a masterpiece of patience and wonder this is. Bravo Victor Rook! We've had the video for about five years and I often buy it as a present for stressed-out friends.  It is serenity itself. *Special note to autism parents: My nonverbal, autistic son (9) and his typical sister (8) both LOVE this video.  Watching it is one of the few things they enjoy together.",1313884800,,871,4.754966887417218

Nature and all its wonders takes on a whole new personality  through the time-lapse photography of ""Beyond The Garden Gate"".  From the first crocus of Spring to the storm clouds of summer and through  to winter's first snow, this film captures each season and all it has to  offer. The mood and feel of each season is highlighted by the accompanying  music, which is a delight all unto itself.
Shortly after I sat down to  view ""Beyond The Garden Gate"", both of my children were drawn  into the room and joined me. My parents then came in and began watching,  too. All of us, ages 8 to 75, watched the film together, in its entirety,  and were captivated by it. We were pleasantly surprised to find the film  alive with animals, birds, reptiles and even insects. My son was mesmerized  by the bugs and the snake while my daughter was delighted with the cats.  Most certainly something for everyone can be found here.
Do be prepared  for the most obvious question of ""HOW did they film that?"" We  asked that question, in amazement, several times during the course of the  film and we're hoping that ""The Filming Of Beyond The Garden  Gate"" will be a sequal!",963878400,29,1303,4.504273504273504
