Most people are used to the calssic overly dramatized styles of now a days, Nazca doesn't use them and that can throw some people off, but when you take it as real life aspect, instead of over done drama it's an elegant and intruiging story.",992563200,2,395,4.5
7895145,4,6305788006,"Episodes 4-6 [included in Blood Rivals] are not as impressive as the first three episodes [included in Blades of Fate].  The story has developed solidly into a battle between ""unchecked brute force"" and ""balance and honor"", and still has enough to keep me interested, but I miss the freshness of the first few episodes.  Most of the character development seems to have been sacrificed to plot and pacing.  DVD has choice of both dubbed and subbed versions.",967507200,,456,4.896103896103896
