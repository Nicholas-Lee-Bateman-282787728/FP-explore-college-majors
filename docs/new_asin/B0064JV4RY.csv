I don't know anyone who saw it for anything other than an amazing story of redemption, humanity, the power of non-judgmental love and acceptance. Circumstances shape who we are to some degree, but exposure to different circumstances, (for better or worse) open our eyes to the possibility that our narrow views can be broadened by the experiences and perspective of others. But I suppose we have to be open to that. In today's world - we could sure use more openess.

4949494,4,B0064JV4RY,"First and foremost I didn't not get this DVD for free. Also, I admit that I am not a movie critic and just a simple guy giving his honest opinion.

This movie is based upon a true story about a quadriplegic and a random man that he chooses to be his caretaker. Despite polar opposite upbringings, they both make last impressions on each other that change their lives forever.

Its a heartwarming film. However, note that this is a non-thrilling drama and bits of the movie does get boring.

DISCLAIMER: THIS MOVIE IS IN FRENCH AND WILL REQUIRE SUBTITLES.

Overall a decent movie, but Im more of an action film kind of guy and I lost interest numerous times throughout the movie.",1518652800,,678,4.532786885245901

  Another fine illustration of the old tenet ""things are not always as they appear"". I seem to remember reading somewhere that this movie is the highest-grossing French-language film of ALL TIME  after watching it, it is easy to see why. This is the kind of character-driver, dialog-centric movie that the major Hollywood studios don't seem to make anymore  what, make a movie that relies on human interaction and emotion alone to drive the plot and to sustain the audience: you MUST be crazy! And, yet, that is EXACTLY what this fine example of movie-making does  by providing us with a glimpse into a very unusual, and extraordinary, friendship. A friendship of the VERY best kind (i.e.a friendship that enriches, and enhances, the lives of BOTH participants). Do yourself a MAJOR favor and watch this movie (and, then go out and be a better friend). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  1.85:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (25.9 Mbps)

  This film's image has some scenes that are so sharp, that it is almost as though you are looking through a window  on the other hand, it also has some scenes (not many, but a few nonetheless) that are ever-so-slightly soft (which, admittedly, might be attributable to the source elements). Even so, this is still one of the best film transfers to blu-ray that you are ever going to see  with its excellent contrast, its superior shadow-detail, its finely rendered colors (colours  for the non-Americans out there) and its TOTAL absence of artifacts (e.g.lines, specs, fluctuations, etc.). Overall, this movie's presentation on blu-ray has AMAZING picture quality, and should satisfy all but the VERY pickiest viewers.

AUDIO:  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (French, 48 KHz, 24-bit)

  The ONLY language available for the soundtrack on this disc is French (which didn't bother me, because I prefer to have ALL of the movies that I experience presented with the Language in which they were made  and, therefore would have selected the French soundtrack anyway [along with English subtitles]  but, it may be an issue for some others). Now, as to the quality of that soundtrack: it features really well-recorded (and, fantastic sounding) music  though it unfortunately doesn't have very much activity in the surrounds (which, honestly, is to be expected with a dialog-driven drama such as this). Speaking of which: the dialog is very clear (though I didn't understand it) and well placed across the front three channels. Considering that this is a dialog-driven movie  without any gunfire or explosions  its audio presentation has MUCH more than acceptable sound quality  and should please the vast majority of listeners.

This story gave me the will to want to live again and these two brought me back to a smiling and happy life that I have all but forgotten existed. Bravo! Now to find more films by these two fabulous actors, hoping that we can find more of the happy storylines that do, once in awhile, come true.",1507852800,,450,3.902173913043478
4949526,1,B0064JV4RY,"It's hard to overstate how much I hated this movie. I just thought it was morally and politically reprehensible. I'm not really sure where to start, so I'll just start listing things.

A Horatio Alger story this is not. I expect a good rags-to-riches story to show how, though moral behavior, a very poor person can rise up to succeed in life.

Well, it seems that the modern Horatio Alger Story completely foregoes the morality part of the story and just expects me to cheer when any poor person, no matter how reprehensible, makes it in life. So this is just a movie about how a vile street thug (a) is rewarded tremendously FOR acting like a vicious street thug, and (b) becomes slightly less thuggish toward the end of the movie. I say ""slightly."" because the opening and closing scenes (which include a lot of the same material) show how he's still the kind of person who thinks the laws don't apply to him, and that endangering other people is fine if it gets him what he wants. This thug has barely changed throughout the movie. Another example is how he steals a Faberge egg and finally returns it by the end of the movie. *slow clap* Wow! What a transformation. A thug decided to return something extremely valuable and sentimental to his super incredibly awesome boss. That's the greatest moral transformation in all of cinema.

The only real moral transformation that goes on here is that of his boss. This is one of those countless stories where the uptight conservative gets paired with the free spirit and it's really the uptight conservative who does all the learning. So the boss learns the glories of doing marijuana, of reckless driving, and of pretending to be having a medical emergency to change an arrest into a police escort to the hospital where he then speeds away.

Sure, he learns not to be such a wimp when it comes from romance, but this side-story is mostly about how he learns that, even though he's an aging quadriplegic, he can still use his incredible wealth to get sex from beautiful young women.

So, in short, it's a story of a moral degenerate having his dreams fulfilled and being given a chance at wild success by helping another man to learn moral degeneracy. I have no idea why anybody finds that interesting. The overwhelming majority of the people giving this movie five-star reviews are surely not moral degenerates, so I don't understand why they approve of this story. I think the answer is that, for some reason, society at large has decided that morality and moral messages are only for extremists and prudes. So many people act moral, but their ideals are increasingly immoral.

This alarms me. It's reprehensible if it's static, but I'm greatly concerned that this thug-chic is a building force, a growing infatuation with thuggishness and lawlessness that remains a fantasy for the majority of people, but that may one day turn from fantasy to reality.

I must finally add that there is a political dimension to this story. There are a lot of people on Amazon complaining about the ""racist stereotypes"" of this movie. I find these comments to be utterly asinine. These ""stereotypes"" are an exact depiction of reality. Of course not every black immigrant is a poor thug, nor is every rich guy a white and conservative sophisticate. But that's beside the point: The positions that this movie shows are an excellent depiction of a major political and social reality, and that's why the movie's proposals for dealing with that reality are so pernicious.

We're supposed to cheer that this thug is gaming the welfare system? Much more importantly, we're supposed to learn a lesson from this show: that simply throwing money at all the thugs in the world is going to make them less thuggish. This is monumentally stupid, and my retort, my counterproposition is that if you reward something you will get more of it. So again, focusing on simply the political dimensions of this movie, the movie states that ignoring the barbaric behavior of these thugs and showering them with the opportunity will civilize them. I completely disagree. I think the old saying is apt: ""millions for defense; not a penny for tribute."" You get more of what you reward and less of what you punish. The appropriate response to barbarians doing barbaric things is to chasten them with rods while rewarding those that cease to be barbaric. This movie promotes the exact opposite.",1507593600,3,4400,4.780263157894737

For those of you who feel down and  want to see something special between two people who couldn't be any different, to possibly want to end up dancing along to the wonderful, CLASSIC soundtrack, and laughing at the subtleties that each character has to their personas, take a chance on a French movie.

I like it so much I decided to buy it and love showing it to visitors who enjoy it as much as I do. (Really.  They even recomm no it to others). I think it was a ""sleeper"" because it's a foreign film, but it's a beautiful, true story, with photos of the real people at the end.  The story starts in the middle of the relationship, then goes back to the beginning when they meet, and returns to the middle to bring it to the end. Masterfully done.

Disabled people want to be treated like jerks just like everyone else, and this movie captures this perfectly. Two people with nothing to lose. You'll LOVE this film. You might recognize the main character from Jurassic World, and he deservingly won the French equivalent of an Academy Award for his work.

Watch it before they remake it for Americans who hate to read.

4949695,5,B0064JV4RY,"This is an absolutely delightful film based on the true story of two unlikely friends brought together under unusual circumstances necessitated by the mutual desire to fulfill their needs with and by each other.  Phillipe, the employer, is a wealthy French quadriplegic who hires an extremely offbeat but charismatic young man to be his personal assistant.

The title of the film, of course, is rife with meaning.  Phillipe, as a person with a severe disability, would ordinarily be thought of by polite society as an ""untouchable,"" and is only spared that stigma by his social status and wealth, both of which he acquired prior to the accident that deprived him of the use of all four of his limbs.  In actual fact, what he needs most is to be touched--on the outside, to assist him with personal needs and activities designed to maintain muscle tone, and on the inside, to be accepted in spite of his physical weaknesses, and encouraged to be more of an emotional risk-taker.

As mismatched as the pair appears to be at the outset of the film, their partnership challenges both of them to ""move outside of their (collective) boxes"" to embrace more of each other's tastes, hobbies, interests, and perspectives on life, to the mutual betterment of them both.  In the midst of this, an endearing friendship develops and blossoms into full maturity.",1475280000,,1347,4.885964912280702

4949776,5,B0064JV4RY,"I ran a video library at work and INTOUCHABLES has been such a popular title that I figured I should see this film. I think I was lucky going into this film ""cold"" not knowing anything more than it is a French film. The cover of the DVD case shows a smiling black man and a middle-aged guy. I figured this was a comedy and probably a police film. It was totally refreshing to be so pleasantly surprised by such a wonderful film.

No, it is not a police film but rather a film about two men and an unconventional but very sincere friendship. Driss (Omar Sy) and Philippe (Francois Cluzet) come from two very different worlds. Driss has seen the dark side of life and Philippe has been blessed with all the good things in life (despite his share of tragedies). These two actors have a chemistry rarely seen in films and you'll be hooked by their story from the very beginning. I won't give away any plot details. I think this film is even more enjoyable not knowing any details about the plot. Watch and enjoy. See how this unconventional friendship develops into mutual respect and affection. Driss and Philippe both have their stories to tell and something brings them together and they will be bonded for life.

INTOUCHABLES is based on a true story and we see the real heroes at the end of the film. It's a story that is heartwarming, funny, inspiration, sad and exhilarating all at the same time. The lead actors are phenomenal with an extra kudos to Cluzet for his charming smile and facial expressions that are the key to this story.  This is one of those very rare films that I could not recommend highly enough. Prepare to be entertained and to appreciate the joy of living.",1467676800,2,1681,4.4869281045751634

It's not easy to take serious subjects (the plight of immigrants and the anguish of the handicapped) and make it funny and touching as well.  These actors pulled it off.  Francois Cluzet is good, as are the supporting actors. Omar Sy who played the immigrant should be a BIG star.  (I looked him up.  He's a standup comedian but in French.)  He was so natural.  This is a France that I didn't know about.  (I bought it before the Paris bombing and this movie will help you to understand the local tensions.)  It's not a heavy movie though; I play it when I want to lighten up.  It's nice to know that some of us can get along... once we get to know each other.

4949965,3,B0064JV4RY,"My question is, should we adore this movie merely because it has the right elements - a person in a wheelchair, a black man, etc - when everyone from women to white men to black men actually are demeaned and devalued through caricature?  In the context of comedy, that is NOT a particularly egregious offense AT ALL, it's actually one of the tools of comedy - as I will say below, it will entertain - but this IS basically The Hangover telling us over and over again that it is the Karate Kid or Whalerider or something.

So let me start by saying this is an alright film.  A little willing suspension of disbelief and willingness to go with it and you'll be entertained.  It's done well at the boxoffice for a reason, obviously.

I'll call a spade a spade here and just say it - there are implicit, constant racist and sexist overtones throughout the movie.  While this isn't a problem for a comedy, it IS a problem for this movie because the tone projected, what we are supposed to get out of this movie - just read the 5 star reviews to see who got the message - rings false compared to the actual content of the movie.

On the one hand, the black male lead is a stereotype - more of an American stereotype of a ""hood rat"" than anything French it would seem.  Living in the projects, faking trying to get a job for welfare as a way of life, stealing at the first opportunity, vandalizing property, constantly rude, disrespectful of women... it all reads like someone's stereotype of a black man.  We see his character portrayed as dismissive and/or derisive of everything from cusine to visual art to music as if he is incapable of comprehending or getting anything out of it.  (you won't see anything like in Pretty Woman where the hooker is taken to, and appreciates an opera concert)  The character is portrayed as believing street art is apparently equivalent to fine art, requiring the same amount of skill and sentiment (very little)

Surely the actual man he was based on was not a crass stereotype of the underclass.  But in this movie, things happen because they happen.  He's a stereotype, but inexplicably does things the stereotype wouldn't do.  The real man must have been different.  The actor of course plays the role excellently, the writing is no fault of his.  Our main character, we are told through various cues is special, but we are shown he is ""special.""

His rude treatment of women and others is given free reign where it would not be with some other character because, what, it's as if he is a child or something? (because he's black?!?!!)  Now, there's plenty of comedies that feature someone coming into a household or other situation and shaking up someone who is in a rut.  They make a mess of things and cause that character trouble but in the end change their lives for the better and it's a comedic, heartwarming story to some extent or other.  What About Bob.  Benny & Joon.  Forrest Gump.  It could also be a child coming into a household situation and shaking things up in a similar fashion.  Sometimes it is even an animal.

You can probably see where I'm going with this but let me spell it out - the premise of all these comedies is that the person who shakes things up is not a fully functional adult.  They're mentally challenged, a little crazy, a child, or an animal.  Their behavior has to be tolerated, indulged, cannot be stopped because of their nature.  That's the joke and that's what forces the character in a rut to get shaken up.

When you drop a poor minority into the same trope... I mean, you can certainly DO that in a comedy and entertain successfully.  But you can't have a convincing elevated tone at the SAME TIME.  You've just cut your legs out from under you, because you're essentially saying ""we have to tolerate this person's behavior because they aren't a fully functioning human adult like you and me,"" which is about as racist as it gets when the character IS a full adult and has no congenital defects to overcome.

On the other hand, basically all white males - this includes even extras in the background - are overbearingly played as sort of slightly effeminate, ineffectual, and in the main character's case helpless - this last IS the premise of the movie so take this with a grain of salt, but stay with me here... over the course of the movie western european art, cusine, prose/poetry, music, and manners are all run roughshod over, dismissed out of hand or at least taken a quick stab at.  The people in the more affluent (refined?) world our main character enters - who happen to be white people - both men and women - are portrayed as uniformly silly.  The white female lead is inexplicably accepting of constant rude sexual advances but then turns out to be lesbian in any case.

The climax of the movie is when the paralyzed rich white man is given a Hitler mustache and made to do a nazi salute.  But that's white people for ya I guess.  Maybe this is the filmmakers' way of letting you know it wasn't your imagination earlier?

So, idunno.  Once you notice the various caricatures going on, you start to feel like they're hitting you over the head with it.  On the other hand, it isn't unusual for comedies to use crass stereotypes, nor for them to really rely on just one or two and just lean on them for the whole film.  So I sit here entertained and with an eyebrow raised.

What were they really trying to say with their film?  Shall we take their cues to us on what we're SUPPOSED to feel is the content, call it the great feel-good french film of 2011?  How'd they get us to FEEL like it was a warm, feelgood movie despite the relatively low-tone actual content?  Because the characters had beautiful smiles while the light hit them just right and there was a man in a wheelchair?

So anyway, it has the outward shape and appearance of a steak but its innards are chicken nuggets.

But sometimes you eat chicken nuggets.",1452297600,,5913,4.507981220657277

4949968,5,B0064JV4RY,"I just finished watching the Intouchables and I am still crying let me tell you why.  There are times that our prejudices can keep us from living and experiencing a life of adventure because of our fears.  We thrive to keep people around us who are more like us and when we encounter those that are somewhat different we become unnerved and fearful. But what happens when life puts you in a circumstance where you have no choice but to encounter a person that is different from you?

The hit film, Intouchables is based upon a true story by Abdul Sellou's international bestseller, You Changed My Life.  Driss plays the life of Abdul.  Driss was adopted as a child and began living with his uncle and aunt. As life continued more children surfaced to live in the crowded apartment then his uncle died and his aunt was left to fend for the now adult Driss and six other children.  Driss did what he could to survive and began to believe that there was no better life for him besides getting unemployment benefits until one day his journey for employment landed him at the home of a wealthy Frenchman, Philippe.

Phillipe became an invalid and was paralyzed from the neck down due to a paragliding adventure.  This journey left him unable to care for himself and with the death of the love of his life, his wife, he had no other reason to live. Due to his behavior he was unable to keep a caregiver to help him with his daily care.  Everything needed to be done by the caregiver for Phillipe from feeding and changing to daily massages/rubs to stimulate the skin and circulation.

Driss had no interest in taking the job but once he saw that this was an opportunity to live a different life he took the challenge.  Phillipe wanted something new and different and despite the other more qualified applicants he decides to take a chance on hiring Driss which turned out to be the best option for both men in the end.

If you are looking for a touching, human, thought-provoking movie about how the lives of opposite can attract for the common good watching Intouchables is a must see!

Despite the differences of their background they began to experience a friendship unlike no other.

4950137,5,B0064JV4RY,"I'm not eloquent with words or details but if you want a good heart felt movie to watched with a loved one, i would suggest this one. I happened across this one by chance on Netflix and sadly they ended up taking it off but I was thankful I was able to catch it at the time I did. Had I not seen it on there I wouldn't be here today, making a purchase to add it to my collection of Movies on Amazon, because I feel it is well worth having.

Fair warning, if you are a softy this movie will have you in tears. I am not one who cries easily in movies but this one did touch my heart. Also if you do not speak French you will have to read subtitles throughout the whole film. Though it would of been nice if they had made it in English as well since both actors have been in Films made in English. Not that there is anything wrong with that in my book but there are times I don't want to deal with subtitles and of course glamorous Amazon does not offer audio adjustments, even for movies that do have them originally on their DVDs. But this movie I am more than willing to read over and over again. Its funny, its intense on a wave of emotions, and it will keep your attention.

As I have said before, this is a great movie to watch when its quality time with the folks (ex: girl night with Mom) or with a sweetheart. It's perfect for the moments when you want to feel close to someone you care about.",1439769600,4,1399,3.992857142857143

4950185,5,B0064JV4RY,"This movie was available on Comcast ""on demand"" a few months ago. My thought was instead of paying the outrageous rental fees that Comcast charges, I would wait until It came to one of the premium channels. Well ,it never did. I ended up doing something that I never do  -purchase a move without ever having watched it.  I received it yesterday in the mail (love Amazon's shipping, I always receive items within a few days) and watched it last night. It is in French with English subtitles. I don't mind subtitles, but if you are one of those who do, be forewarned - it is all subtitles.  Such a touching movie. I read some of the other reviews and there some some  comments regarding stereotypes, etc. I guess if you were looking for that, you could see whatever you wanted to see. However, if you just pay attention to the storyline and forget about anything else, you will come away with a warm ""feel-good""  impression. Yes, it is a movie, so I am sure some things were exaggerated (show me one movie based on true events where that has not occurred), but forget that - and watch the movie for what it is.  As  stated, this is one of the best movies I have watched in a long time. The acting is  excellent, the storyline is excellent .  Loved this movie",1436918400,2,1256,4.379310344827586

This movie is beautiful, sad, moving, funny and uplifting. I have watched it three times already and it keeps moving me in the same way and does not get one bit less good or less interesting.

The actors do a superb job. This is one of those movies that I know I will watch over and over again in the years to come and I would not want it to be missing from my movie library.

4950221,5,B0064JV4RY,"The Intouchables (2011)

 The best film I have seen this year turns out to be French, from 2011 (I missed it first time around) and about the unlikely relationship between a paraplegic billionaire and a Senegalese lout in Paris.  Switch me hard if this didn't turn out to be a wonderful, delightful and all around very nice film.
 It could be such a film only because of the animated, joyful and with an irresistible zest for life with which Omar Sy plays the Senegalese care taker.  French born Sy has more conventional roles in X-men: Days of Future Past and the just released Jurassic World, supporting roles that demonstrate that he can handle a variety of acting tasks.  But Omar Sy as Driss, the street wise care taker comes close to the miraculous.  Francois Cluzet plays Philippe, the paraplegic, a tragic figure ruined in a hang gliding accident.  The relentlessly self serving street runner and the broken billionaire turn out to be very good for each other.  Driss has much to learn and Philippe has plenty to teach, and plenty to forget and plenty to think about in a totally different way.
 The two French writer/directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache manage to tell a very sensitive story without becoming mawkish or overly sentimental.  We sympathize with the plight of the wheelchair bound man, a man of great intelligence, culture, attainment and drive.  We sympathize with him but he shows us constantly that he is worthy of our admiration and not simply our pity.
 And Toledano and Nakache provide the laughs that make everything so very much easier.  They poke gentle fun at the French artistic pretensions and totally dissolve any restraint that most of us have around the severely handicapped.  They also manage a quick peek into the life of lower class immigrants to France that we do not often see.
 This four and a half star import has an R rating for very grown up themes, not nasty but adult.  It lasts for one hour and 52 minutes.  It speaks French to us but English sub-titles suffice for those who do not speak the language of philosophy and culture.",1434326400,,2085,4.728531855955679

4950229,5,B0064JV4RY,"The Intouchables is a French film that is about an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility. A rich quadriplegic, living in a mansion in Paris, requires a live-in carer. A young offender turns up for an interview, but he is not really looking to get the job. However, to his surprise, he is hired. The two men then develop a close friendship. It features Franois Cluzet and Omar Sy; and it was directed by Olivier Nakache and ric Toledano.

There are countless magical moments worth recounting - many with humor and involving the clash of the classes - it is not surprising that the film has been a runaway hit in France and elsewhere in Europe. Capturing the unspoken shorthand, the adventurousness and the humor essential to enduring friendships makes the The Intouchables must see as it handles its potentially prickly subject matter with kid gloves. Added to that, it gets by thanks to its strong cast and some remarkably sensitive direction.",1433548800,,980,4.9393939393939394

4950238,3,B0064JV4RY,"This is apparently based on a true story (at the very end of the movie, we are told what the two men are doing today). The story is interesting while having a fairly predictable ending - not always a fault, in my opinion.
For parents of teens: I had the mistake of allowing my teens to watch this without me previewing it. They were trying to practice their French but we still put on the subtitles....which was my mistake (as a parent).  There is quite a bit ""language"" and also a lot of talk about sex but what it does not show any nudity. Still, it is quite clear where they are/what they are doing. There are some laugh out loud spots and some parental cringing spots in the movie.  I wouldn't have chosen to show this to all my teens if I'd previewed it but you might think differently.
What was the point of this movie? It does have a happy ending but there seemed to be a point the creators were going for. I am not certain what the movie's true message was intended to be/send. Maybe that is why I didn't fall in love with Intouchables. It was just a little too ambiguous. My guess is that the message is that friends can come from all backgrounds but there were moments when it seemed to go on a tangent.
The two main characters are very likable as are the supporting cast - even the daughter and ""mop-head"" boyfriend endear themselves to the viewer. By the end, both men had grown because of the other's influence in their lives. One passes along smoking cigs and pot and visiting hookers while the other gets exposed to art and music and self-discipline. In the end, both have been ""tweaked"" by the experience of being friends with each other.",1432944000,2,1654,4.366883116883117

The movie is actually rather uplifting. Very unexpected story and events! If you like unusual stories and black humor (but not gross or put-down stuff), you may like this. I cannot think of anything to compare it to. Maybe it is a bit like the black humor in Keeping Mum or Death at a Funeral, except this is actually heart-warming, and, I think, based on a true story. The humor comes, not from contrived fictional situations, but from people confronting life in creative, outlandish ways with the attitude of ""you're not getting the best of me""!",1432944000,,699,4.511811023622047

A touching, yet simple, story of friendship and differences. The movie was full of laughs and surprisingly mostly at the expense of Philippes disability. Terrific casting for a warm and engaging film of how the relationship between two completely different people develops. I truly loved it and recommend it to everyone.

So it's also a great way to have diversity discussions: socioeconomic differences, educated vs not educated, racial/ethnic, young vs old generation, physically disabled, human relationships/friendships/ romance, etc. The French dark humor keeps you engaged and laughing throughout the movie.

The film is loosely based on a true story of a wealthy quadriplegic who is looking to hire someone who can assist him with daily life.  The person he hires is a poor immigrant who only went on the job interview to meet the requirements for welfare payments.  In the process of challenging each other in different ways, they develop a deep and lasting friendship.  Note: my description may sound sappy but the movie is not.  It has great humor and heart with multiple surprises.  I highly recommend it!!",1425081600,,563,4.636363636363637

The Intouchables has earned a place among my all-time favorites.  The story is wonderful, the acting great, and the chemistry between the characters transported me to France.  Of course I had to read the subtitles (English) and one often misses much with the subtitle short-hand while paying so close attention to the written word.  To counteract that deficit I watched it 3 more times, and with each watching was able to rely less on the subtitles and truly watch the charcters.  I can only say that if you have not seen it-- see it and prepare to be transported as though you are there.  A good movie makes you forget it's a movie, and The Intouchables certainly does that.",1424995200,2,823,4.375

This Title is much more appropriate since this film is a true story about two individuals from completely different backgrounds become best friends and are still friends today.

4950408,3,B0064JV4RY,"I too was impressed that in well over 1000 reviews here, no one has ever rated this movie at less that a huge FOUR stars.
This will make me the first, and rest assured I take no pride in that.
Admittedly there are many things to like about ""The Intouchables"". It is most assuredly one of those movies aimed very firmly at the heart-strings.

It's beautifully filmed, superb camera work in fact, and for the most part the Parisian settings are wonderful, with Louis furniture I'm sure is already on the ""Desired Acquisitions"" list for the Palace of Versailles.

Supposedly based on a true story, ...which translated means ""once there was this man in a wheelchair but huge liberties have been taken"", it purports to tell the story of a sassy uneducated but streetwise black man, ...a petty criminal (OF COURSE! He's black!), from the poor ghettos just outside the Priphrique of Paris, who accidentally ends up being employed as a carer for a totally incapacitated but very wealthy intellectual white man. (Of course! He's white!)
All the black guy wanted was his welfare benefits card signed to say he'd applied for a job, but for some inexplicable reason, despite his most disrespectful demeanour and chip-on-the-shoulder attitude, he gets the position.

Two opposites in colour, mindset, AND physical abilities thrown together in a demanding situation?
The white intellectual incapable of even moving, and the black uneducated petty stand-over man who can do anything physical but has trouble with thinking?

Now somebody less kind than I would be already screaming ""stereotypes"" here, and truthfully the premise IS really a revisit of those many cop-partner movies where complete opposites are forced to work together to overcome some adversity.

The performances are great, but when at the end we are given a brief glimpse of the REAL-LIFE pair, let me just say some VERY large liberties have been taken in casting FAR more attractive people, particularly for the black role.
Suddenly he's a much taller, a far more lithe athletic rapster looking bloke than the man he's supposedly playing. He's much more physically threatening, which he takes advantage of several times in the story.
He can even dance like a rock-star!

There are the usual scenes where the two cultures clash, ...black man smokes dope and offers it to white man who's never had it before etc.
And some confronting issues when it's explained to the carer that his task will also include VERY invasive manual assistance with defecation, due to the complete paralysis of his employer. (Rubber gloves thoughtfully provided!)

There are a few very minor subplots involving the daughter's romantic problems, and the black-self-assured live-in aid's ultimately unsuccessful attempts to pick up the blonde secretary but basically it's each educating the other in the ways of their own particular world.

Now while the patient is completely dependent on the black man from the start, we see that the carer too is becoming more and more dependent on his charge....and not just for the money and life-style. There is an emotional bond emerging.

Then for some reason not quite clearly explained the quadriplegic suddenly dismisses his carer, although he clearly enjoys his company and his ministrations.
Perhaps he think's he's needed back in the slums?
Replacements prove entirely unsuitable, even annoying, despite their best efforts.

Now the film as mentioned before IS incredibly glossy, which leads me to say that should you ever have the misfortune to break your second and third vertebrae and subsequently become a totally dependent quadriplegic, DO make very sure you are a multi-millionaire first.
The wheelchair-bound patient is able to purchase art for incredible sums, hire Lear-jets for a joy flight just on a whim, go para-gliding, he owns a very expensive car and lives in huge smart apartment right in the centre of Paris which is furnished with museum quality items and paintings....not to mention a large staff.
The source of his wealth is not explained, but he can apparently afford literally anything.

Call me a cynic, BUT I did wonder if the huge amount of money had been removed from the story, if any of it would have happened at all.
Black-guy initially only stays due to his bedroom etc. being so lavish.
Would he bother to care for such a very high maintenance person if they were not so mega-wealthy?
He even steals an expensive Faberg egg from his employer.

I certainly enjoyed this movie, up to a point. Clearly not as much as others here.
Yes it's  very ""heart-warming"" and ""life-affirming"" and it all turns out well in the end. (Although a little unbelievably.)
People no doubt enjoy that.
It does manage to avoid any saccharine sentimentality, although flirts with it occasionally, and all the actors turn in such great and believable performances.

Small mention must be made of the subtitles.
If you too understand idiomatic French, you will very quickly realise that what is translated on the screen is NOT exactly what is being said.
There is a degree of censorship in this.
There are more than a few scenes which will bring a certain smile to many people's lips.

It's not so much a case of I didn't like the movie, but more of the manipulative contrivances that rang just a little too untrue for me and thus I felt outside the warm-fuzzy miasma the movie would project.
I would like to be able to give this 3 stars, but that is not an option here on Amazon.
Certainly recommended, ...but with some reservations.",1420848000,3,5513,4.957746478873239

4950474,4,B0064JV4RY,"This is an enjoyable movie. It holds your interest, has a lot of really funny scenes, and has a good message. At times it is inspiring. I didn't like being asked to admire the bullying behavior of Driss, the young man assisting the quadriplegic character, in some scenes. The acting is very good. There are aspects of the plot that could only occur in a French movie script (I won't do a spoilers here), but overall it is well worth seeing. We did watch it with our 9-year-old. There were only a few brief places where we made him hold his ears and look away (e.g., during a discussion of the ears as a good erogenous zone for a quadriplegic person), but he laughed at all of the funny parts and enjoyed it even if it wasn't a ""kids' movie.""",1418169600,,741,4.3
4950475,5,B0064JV4RY,"I will add my review to the hundreds of others. This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. And it's more faithful to the true story than are most movies. (The memoirs of both characters are readily available, and I've read some interviews with both). I've recommended this movie to everyone I know. It's funny, moving, and informative about the experiences of someone with a severe disability. It's also informative about how healthcare providers without a host of preconceptions can sometimes be more effective than those with extensive training. Bringing freshness, humor and warmth to a patient is a major component in being an effective caregiver.",1418083200,,656,5.083333333333333

4950509,5,B0064JV4RY,"I don't usually like to watch foreign films, but after seeing this one, my entire perspective has changed. I would not only rate this as a great foreign film, but as one of the finest motion pictures that I've ever had the pleasure to see.

It's the story of an ex-con Driss from the projects who has to go looking for work in order to continue receiving his benefit checks. He has no desire at all to work and is simply going through the motions so that he can get signatures stating that he applied for jobs. The signatures are all he needs in order to keep his unemployment checks coming. Than, out of the blue, he arrives at the mansion of eccentric French aristocrat Philippe, a quadriplegic looking for someone to spend time with and take care of him. Driss, who's the most unqualified person for the job, is unexpectedly hired for the position due to his completely off the wall personality.

Once on the job, Driss becomes an inspiration to Philipe and the movie takes off from there. This is not a sad film, but rather an uplifting account of two of the most unlikely paired partners that will leave you crying with joy. It's an extremely satisfying film, full of adventure, humor and a wonderful message about overcoming adversity. This is a true story, which will change your perception of life. One could not imagine that two such completely different people could end up being such a perfect match-up, but such is the case in this incredible and true story.

This film is extremely moving, very funny and without a doubt extraordinarily positive in nature. It's a beautiful story of friendship and how two people who are complete opposites end up saving each other. I not only recommend seeing this film once, but watch it several times to get its full impact. It's a glorious film that will leave you speechless in the end. It truly is a life changing adventure, not to be missed.",1417392000,,1894,4.597633136094674

If I have to make a list of French films I like [which I hardly do, simply because I am too much of a simpleton to enjoy too subtle or too intellectual approach of their productions], this movie will have to be on it.
In case you are wondering, it does not have race relation message like our American releases, but it does show friction and tension; yet what surpasses all mandatory and mundane elements of daily life are friendship, human spirit, empathy, romance and well, deep connection between two human beings.",1413936000,,605,4.771428571428571

Amazon did not clearly state that this movie was SUBTITLED in English, but the spoken language was French.

We are senior citizens and wear glasses. Our eyesight is not the best for reading small subtitles at a distance.
The TV is too far away and the subtitles too small to read at a distance.

4950696,5,B0064JV4RY,"Francois Cluzet, a great actor, never obscures the luminence of Omar Sy in this remarkably warm film. Omar Sy is a delight and completely embodies the emotional clarity of his character. When he laughs it is the most honest reaction to hilarity and I laughed wholeheartedly with him. This is a beautiful and cathartic film. I own it and even when I'm not watching it, there are two moments in the film that I often fast forward to, just to laugh and feel the sheer joy those moments deliver. Sy's character, becomes a caretaker who treats Cluzet's paraplegic character with warmth and confidence--and without pity. He shares his strength with the man who cannot move. You will have fun and laugh and have your heart jump-started when you watch this film. There is nothing sad or maudlin here!

I forgot to mention that this film is in French with English subtitles. Don't let that impede your decision to watch it. It's fabulous fun.",1408579200,3,933,4.723926380368098

4950831,5,B0064JV4RY,"Wow!  So many reviewers have done an excellent job describing why THE INTOUCHABLES is such a great movie, it's very little for me to add.  I can only repeat that this movie is superb because the director was able to balance comedy with drama; using characters who were so different ethnically, culturally, socially, and from extremely different economic classes, it was a pleasure watching how the two interacted and broached their 'class' differences.

Also, I thought it was especially poignant that Philippe's desire to enjoy his life, despite his sever handicap, helped viewers better understand why individuals with such handicaps make the choices they do.  I've seen awesome courage among severely handicapped individuals; some of whom participate in 'Special Olympics', and some whose stories are told in inspirational documentaries.  And, in The Intouchables, we get to appreciate how Phillippe and his caretaker, Driss are able to build an unlikely  relationship.  Indeed, Phillipe concedes that his money allows him to enjoy a limited quality of life, because of his will to live.

Conversely, there are many other severely handicapped individuals who lack the will or desire to live with their irreversible conditions.  This begs the question if we as individuals have the right to 'choose' death with dignity when suffering sever handicaps.  This was the moral quandary in the case of the Spanish quadriplegic, Ramon Sampedro whose story was adapted to film.  The movie, THE SEA INSIDE [2004] starred Javier Bardem as Ramon Sampedro, a quadriplegic not unlike the wealthy Phillippe in The Intouchables, who was completely dependent on caretakers.  Yet, unlike our 'hero' Phillippe, Ramon Sampedro was just as impassioned. But here the similarities end. Sampedro would fight the Spanish government for almost 30 years for his right - not to live- but the right to an assistant suicide/euthanasia.

Not sure about anyone else, but I would have to applaud the character, Phillippe for his courage and zest or life despite the severity of his handicap.  Yet, I also feel compassion for Sampedro. Therefore, I'd  avoid passing moral judgment on Ramon Sampedro for the choice and battle he fought for his right to ownership of dignity in death.

Undoubtedly, The Intouchables was probably the best French movie I've seen in decades.

While this isn't the greatest movie ever filmed it gets a solid 4 out of 5 Amazon Stars from me.
Well-acted and a feel good flick that I've watched online several times already, thus the purchase for personal collection.

Regarding the Blu-ray Disc that I purchased on this very page (see my added images):

The Blu-ray Disc that I received most definitely does not look as pictured in the image.
I am pretty sure that I received the French edition/version of the Blue-ray because it came inside a black (not blue) Blue-ray box.
If you speak French then you won't be disappointed, so order away!
However, I do not (only beginning to learn) and there isn't a word of English anywhere on the box!
BUT what is a MAJOR problem is the fact that THERE ARE NO ENGLISH subtitles, only French!

...and before you make some silly-ass comment about how I have to press the Subtitle button on my remote to get to the English subtitles save your troll keystrokes.  I watch many foreign films and know how to get to the Subtitles menu and how to select the preferred language. Except, you can't select something that isn't there, can you?  Putain!!!!

So, needless to say, I am returning this French version Blu-ray Disc in black factory box and will be purchasing the blue-boxed one (as in the picture) released with English subtitles!",1402963200,,1350,4.670886075949367

4950870,5,B0064JV4RY,"When I searched through Amazon's ""foreign language"" films to find something in French for my French students to experience, I found ""The Intouchables"" and decided to buy and try it, even though it contains strong language (lots of it), some drug use, and a mild hooker scene. Despite the negatives, students loved the film! As did I! (Note: The film is a French movie, but subtitles render it easy to follow.)

It's a life-affirming story of people and activities. The African immigrant (as a young child) who is hired to be the personal assistant to Phillipe, a quadriplegic, totally dependent on others for his upkeep and even his life, is so winsome that it is almost impossible not to love this character. Driss comes to the interview to get a signature for unemployment, but, instead, is hired because he does not feel pity for the Frenchman or his circumstances. Driss even tells Phillipe in one scene that he won't give him some candy out of his bag. Why? ""No handy, no candy."" It is meant to be funny and it is. Driss badgers Phillipe into laughing at his own handicap.

The only thing that can carry off this blatant humor is the actor himself, Omar Sy, who won the French equivalent of the Academy Award for Best Actor. In his humility, he told one reporter that both should have received the award. ""How can an award be split between two people when it took both people to make the story,"" he asked.

There are so many wonderfully funny, poignant, and dramatic scenes throughout the movie. One of my faves is the scene in which he learns how large his bathroom is and that he has his own great big tub. He promptly seeks out Phillipe's secretary for whom Driss has a major attraction and asks her if she would like to take a bath with him. He is so serious. She is so rejecting.

The ending is a great, warm delight. The range of emotions that passes over Phillipe's face (Francois Cluzet) is miraculous. ""The Intouchables"" is truly one of the great films.

I first saw Francois Cluzet back in the 80s when I was in London in a film called ' L'enfer ' and was impressed.  Many years have passed and now he is a middle aged man, and I enjoyed him in this film as well, though the character was completely different.

The film tells the story of a wealthy quadriplegic who interviews potential caretakers who will serve him without pity. The caretaker who is hired is looking for help too. He needs someone to sign papers so that he can get benefits. Together, they help one another overcome personal hurdles while sharing laughter, sorrows and joys. In the process, they learn from each other and teach life lessons to those who witness their interactions onstage and onscreen.

A French billionaire parapalegic hires an tall,  outspoken Rhodesian from the projects as his full time personal care giver.  Boom!  Why?  The man is is honest, not a whit of pity, smart, strong with a good heart and grounded in the same virtues that made his boss rich.  It's a great story how both men help each other: the billionaire learns that he can be cherished and loved by a woman for his  intellectual life; the black man to look again at his family responsibilities and sticking fast to what nurtures him: family and the family's love...even though he's adopted.  At road speed in the Maserati, they smoke, lie,  intimidate police with harmless scams, love the ocean, ""get away flying his private Lear jet, hang glider flying as fears are overcome...finally  parting as men,  each to his own destiny.

4951004,5,B0064JV4RY,"It is rare that a movie has such an strong affect on me that I will take the time to write a review, but in the case of The Intouchables, I felt compelled to write this review.

This is a movie that has so many layers to it that it is hard to know where to begin so let's start with the actors. The two lead actors, Franois Cluzet who plays Philippe, a rich quadriplegic does an unbelievable job bringing this character to life. If this were an American made movie he would have won an Oscar and probably would be looked at as one of the great actors of his generation. Watch him throughout the film and think about how he is acting with his eyes, voice and facial expression. I suspect in France he is looked upon with the type of respect that we reserve for our greatest actors. The actor who plays Driss is Omar Sy. He brings a rare combination of energy and pathos to his character that makes this unbelievable story very believable. And this brings us to why this is such a magnificent film. The story is not very believable with one huge exception, it is based on a true story. If someone wrote this script and it was not based on a true story I would have laughed and thought 'this is silly no one will believe it'.

It is a film about hope, redemption, friendship and joy. Philippe hires Driss to care for him as he is completely reliant on others to care for him since he can only move from the neck up due to an accident he was involved in. Against the wishes of the people around him he gives Driss a chance even though he brings no experience or knowledge of how to care for him as well as a somewhat sorted past. I guess maybe there was something in his guts that caused him to give Driss this opportunity.

Without giving too much away I'll simply says that many of the scenes are so funny and heartfelt between these two men it will make even the toughest guy in the room tear up as well as laugh out loud. Driss brings new life to this man who has so little to live for and even though Driss is reckless it does not matter because the core of this film is about the friendship these two men developed and how they in many ways saved each other.

I have seen thousand of movies throughout my life and I can honestly say this is in my top 5 of all time favorite movies for many reasons. It gives you a sense that things can always get better even in the worst of circumstances. Also the fact that we can be so entertained without all of the CGI and special effects ( i like these movies as well) brings you back to what makes a movie great. The acting, the writing and the storytelling.

By the way, please keep watching the final credits as there is a beautiful scene of the real life men this story is about and when you seen what has happened to them today, you will feel tremendous joy.

I can't recommend this movie enough. You will not be disappointed. It is also a great movie for those of you who have kids even though that is not the target audience for the movie. Watch it with them and talk to them afterwards about the message in this movie. It teaches great life lessons .",1395014400,,3099,4.173913043478261

4951035,5,B0064JV4RY,"I saw the previews for this movie although I can't remember where but even with just seeing the previews immediately knew I had to see it...and secretly I love movies in subtitles.

I loved that this movie was based on a true story and that it showed how one life effect another so dramatically and also how through time how peoples behaviour and preconceived notions about what we think we know about people can change.

The acting was suburb and because of the great acting I knew what was going on without reading the subtitles-which means for me that I am really enjoying the movie and really involved in the characters and what is going on.

One of the funniest and some odd reason my favourite part of the movie was the point where Driss pours piping HOT water on Philippe leg and is shocked when Philippe cannot feel it and continues doing it and Philippe asked if he was basically done screwing around...and Driss isn't think that he could could burn Philippe...

There are touching moments as well as funny moments in this movie.

Thinking that I was getting that movie with Stallone, Willis, Staham, Norris, Crews, Von Damme, etc. - can't recall its name, I ordered this from Amazon without reading the synopsis.  When it arrived, I didn't pay much attention to the packaging, and brought it over to the big event.

Well, first of all, it's in FRENCH!  And it has subtitles!  And it starts out, with high promise, with a phenomenal car chase scene - YES!!! And then it turns into one of the most poignant, tender love stories I've ever seen!  What a great film. Don't miss this ""based-on-actual-events"" tale.",1391817600,2,827,4.78169014084507

4951102,5,B0064JV4RY,The first time I saw this I had no idea what to expect other than what it said on the outside of the package.  We were enchanted and enthralled. To say that we loved it is an understatement! The actors were incredible and to find out it was based on a true story was a bonus. As soon as it was over I ran to the computer and ordered a copy.,1391731200,,340,3.788732394366197
4951103,5,B0064JV4RY,Love the choice of content and approach of a difficult subject matter in real life. The actors mesh beautifully in this touching story of a bond between two people from two different worlds.,1391644800,,190,4.787878787878788

4951105,5,B0064JV4RY,"I rented this because I enjoy movies based on true stories.  This was one of the most outstanding movies I have seen in a long
time.  The two main actors were incredible.  I would have thought they were best friends in real life.  What is funny, is that we had
a ""girls night out"" and this was the movie we watched. I bought the movie and then loaned it out to each of them to watch again.  Very
impacting and wonderful to know that there are decent people out there who see the heart and not just what is on the outside.",1391472000,,521,4.068627450980392
4951106,5,B0064JV4RY,"I am a college professor in Psychology and Counseling, and I ordered this film to show in class to illustrate the power of human connection and recognizing how stereotypes often limit our ability to experience true intimacy.  The subtitles only added to impact of the film in my opinion.",1391472000,,287,4.857142857142857
4951107,5,B0064JV4RY,"Watching this movie reminded me how joyful the viewing experience can be when a filmmaker and writers have a true, singular vision, and refuse to take shortcuts.  The Intouchables' grand achievement is in creating a wonderful and touching character study of the relationship between two very different men. Rather than resort to the tawdry or simplistic plot devices one might expect, the film never gets maudlin or preachy, or goes overboard with slapstick humor.  Every balance is achieved, every note hit true and clear.

The only character (development) flaw being the circuitous explanation of Driss' background and family. However, this is a VERY minor complaint.

I would give The Intouchables six stars if I could. Marvelous.",1391385600,,733,5.293103448275862

4951111,5,B0064JV4RY,"This movie proves that life can be good and fun, even against all odds. It demonstrate that pity is not necessarily the route to take when dealing with handicapped people and that, by acting as if they were not disabled, is helping them much more.

4951127,5,B0064JV4RY,"The opening scene alone will rip you out of whatever doldrums  in which you happen to find yourself. Touching, sweet, loving and transformative is the answer. This is my go-to if I'm ever down---so beautifully done. And<spoiler alert> THEN you see the real men at the end of the film. This is based on a beautiful,  TRUE story.",1390953600,,327,4.620689655172414
4951128,4,B0064JV4RY,"It's hard not to like this movie. The English subtitles are fine, though there is ambient voices that are not interpreted. I would have loved this movie, but there were too many off color jokes (no pun intended). There is a point to the crudity,though & that is that it allows a way to deal the circumstances, but it would have been a great film for all ages if they had left out the crass content.",1390608000,2,398,4.25
4951129,5,B0064JV4RY,"Touching but realistic story about  the common humanity in all of us.

4951131,5,B0064JV4RY,"This story is delightful - the good part it is true!  Fellowship among men is rare, however when it happens - it is better than a marriage! Each in the relationship knows what to expect from the other and when one leaves the other feels lost.  Very evident in this flick, strongly recommend!",1390435200,,291,4.471698113207547

4951133,4,B0064JV4RY,"A true life drama about an unlikely friendship between Philippe (Francois Cluzet), a man learned man of privilege but also an quadriplegic and Driss ( Omar Sy) who is also a street smart con merely applying for a job taking care of Phillippe  in order to receive benefits.
This is a buddy movie at heart, about souls from different walks of life getting together and both learning a lot from each other. This is  a sort of movie that is entertaining and heart wrenching at times based on a true story about the original caregiver an Algerian immigrant.
The film seems like a rehash of many old Hollywood buddy movies but still entertaining and sad in the right places nevertheless.",1390348800,,681,4.666666666666667
4951144,3,B0064JV4RY,"It was a good story.  Unfortunately, it was one of those movies that had been so hyped up to me that it was destined to fall short.  In addition, I didn't realize that it was not in English and had subtitles.  It was a good movie though and once I got into it, I seems to forget about the subtitles.",1390348800,2,299,3.95
4951145,5,B0064JV4RY,I saw this movie as a preview as I watched another movie and then I ordered it from my local library. I waited forever and as soon as I watched it it was so delightful and enjoyable I purchased it on Amazon. I had to own it. The friendship between these two men is wonderful. They are honest with each other and care about one another. As the story tells their relationship is so far more healthy than with his other caretakers. I purchased two other copies of this movie to share with friends. I really enjoyed this movie.,1390262400,,523,4.292929292929293
4951146,5,B0064JV4RY,I preorderd 3 copies of this film after seeing it on a flight. It is a beautiful film and the characters will stay in your heart.,1390176000,,129,4.0
4951147,5,B0064JV4RY,"So different from the usual Hollywood drivel or action flick.  This masterfully acted movie has great character development, and knowing it's based on a true story makes it even more interesting.",1390176000,,195,5.290322580645161
4951148,5,B0064JV4RY,"I did not read any reviews before watching this movie, and I'm glad I didn't.  But if you are reading this before watching the movie, I hope this will be a good thing!  Anyway, I did not find anything racist about this film at all.  I lived in Paris for two years.  It is, like most large cosmopolitan cities, a cross-configuration of many cultures.  Yes, you have the iconic glamour of the boulevards, the Seine and the monuments, and you also have large neighborhoods made up of struggling immigrant populations. There is wealth and status and there is poverty and crime.  In this film, you see a character from each of these worlds cross paths, and the events and the emotions that ensue are a joy to behold and to experience.  Okay, so the wealthy guy is white, and the black guy is poor.  It's not meant to be a stereotype.  Francois Cluzet's character is from the aristocracy and Omar Sy's character is an immigrant.  And when you watch the film, ask yourself which one you would rather be.  Ask yourself which one is happier, or more fortunate.  So let's move on.  At first glance, it seems that this is going to be a heavy film, but what makes it work is the humor. There is a warmly comic element throughout. In several parts I laughed out loud, loudly.  And there are more than a few surprises to keep you on your toes.  The ending is superb; you wonder where it is going and where it goes is just fine.  There's even a nagging little loose end that is tied up in the final scene that is nicely symbolic of the transformation that has taken place within the character played by Omar Sy.  God, what an infectious laugh, smile and genuine affability he has!  Francois Cluzet is an immensely talented, seasoned actor.  Few actors come to mind whose emotions seem absolutely real rather than acted.  On a final note, I have seen many reviews where the viewer wishes that the film were dubbed.  I would respectfully urge you to watch the film with subtitles even if you are hesitant.  It is impossible to get the true feel of the characters' personalities otherwise. Watch the movie twice if you have to in order to get it all.  I wouldn't mind watching it again myself.  All and all a wonderful film.  I highly recommend it, whether you speak French or not.",1390089600,,2263,4.474327628361858
4951149,5,B0064JV4RY,Too bad it is not better known.  A touching story (based on a true one) that just makes you feel good. It is sub titled but easy to follow.,1390003200,,139,3.793103448275862

4951151,5,B0064JV4RY,I usually don't buy foreign films because I think reading all the dialogue takes away from watching the characters but this was different.  The caretaker was a hero who gave back this man the life he deserved . . . and had fun doing it!,1390003200,,236,4.2444444444444445
4951152,5,B0064JV4RY,"I'm sure you can find a synopsis about this film elsewhere, so I'll just describe my reaction to it.  For starters, I'll say that I HATE subtitled movies as a general rule because I'm sort of ADHD so I find it challenging to really follow the story when I have to read stuff at the bottom of the screen.  In fact, when I first tried to watch this film, I didn't make it past the first 10 minutes because I thought OMG, it's in French!!  However, a friend of mine subsequently invited me over to his place to see the movie after dinner one evening, and I agreed mainly to be sociable even though I figured I was going to be bored.  Much to my surprise, I found myself actually LOVING THIS FILM despite the subtitled foreign language!!!  It is such a wonderfully done, uplifting story that I have since recommended to several other people.  It really is great. Bottom line, if you only see one picture this year, I would make sure it was ""The Intouchables"".  I think you'll love it!",1390003200,,980,4.351648351648351

By the way, it took months for this DVD to arrive as it was produced in France.  It was well worth the wait.
Did I forget to mention that I could not remember if the dialogue was in French or English after seeing the movie the first time?",1387843200,2,432,4.2439024390243905

4951230,1,B0064JV4RY,I wonder if any other country would have done an injustice to this movie as the FRENCH have.  Whomever did the translation from French to English left out most of the dialog thereby perhaps taking a great movie and turning it into an OK movie.  I was left with more questions than answers since the entire conversions were not translated into subtitles.  I know other people who saw the movie more than once or twice to find out what was going on.  I refuse to do that.  I would rather read the book. Just know that you will loose a lot if you do not understand French.  Guess the French want to keep the English speaking world guessing about everything happening in this movie.  I was very disappointed that I missed out on this movie.  I wonder if the director and producers realize that the whole world can not enjoy this movie as the French do.,1387411200,4,848,4.391025641025641

4951244,4,B0064JV4RY,"I think it was a wonderful movie, heartwarming and funny.  It stopped just short of being great for us, because the English translation wasn't very accurate.  We speak French, but frequently have someone with us that doesn't, so I would prefer that the translation was closer to the French words.

While it might be called a 'chick flick' I believe there is enough 'male' content to be interesting and relevant to men; considering the primary characters are men. Probably not 20 something and younger, but mature men.
The only problem was that sometimes the subtitles (its a French movie) were the same color as the background and a little hard to read. I could read them, but my friend had trouble.

Neither one leads his dream life and initially focuses on present unhappiness. However, Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic, hires a black ex-criminal, Driss, to serve as his hands after a spate of highly-educated Frenchmen fail to meet Philippe's true need: humanity. Driss, uneducated yet fun-loving, pulls Philippe into a ""baser"" but more thrilling mentality of adventure and excitement; in essence, Driss leads Philippe back to living, rather than waiting out, life. Despite some vulgar language (it's an adolescent to adult movie after all!), the movie pulls off an emotive, artistic and personal effect to leave my wife and me rejoicing in the healing capabilities of the human spirit.",1382400000,,868,5.485074626865671

I FOUND THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION SO GOOD THAT AFTER A WHILE I NEVER REALIZED THAT I WAS READING THE DIALOGUE AS THE ACTORS WERE SPEAKING FRENCH.  IT JUST FLOWED SO NATURALLY.

I immediately did a search on Amazon, and there it was.  One quick click and I had it two days later!  To my delight, the Maserati appears frequently and, more often than not, at high speeds.....ooohhh, the sounds that car makes!  However, this revue is supposed to be about the movie, and while I must admit that I've never really been able to get into foreign movies with subtitles, this movie grabbed my immediate attention and held me glued to our big screen TV until the credits at the end were over.  The best part is that it the movie based on a true story.  The movie is very well done, cinematography is great, screenplay is inspired, acting is on par with some of the best in the business, and it pulls the viewer into the story so well that you can't wait to see what happens next.  Emotions run from knee-slapping, laugh-out-loud to an unexpected lump in the throat.  Oh, and did I mention the Maserati??  This movie has taken its place among my all-time favorites and I know I will watch it again and again (already watched it three times).  Don't miss this one, you will be the better for it!

I NEVER pay more than 6 buck for a flick, but snapped this up immediately when I saw it for 15.

Christ, I hope the Americans don't wreck this masterpiece with a follow up pile of poop.

Maybe if they stuck Colin Firth as Philippe in the wheel chair and Leigh Francis as Driss making the stiff faced Firth poop his pants with laughter, then it might be some kind of comedy ?

Well for the original, I enjoyed watching it four times over on Sky and bought the DVD shortly after, plus a few more copies to hand out for others to enjoy.

It won't be long again I expect till I get a hankering for another viewing.

As for those (very few) reviews for those less literate grumbling about the subtitles, I watched the film a few times over and still had not realised the film used subtitles, as I was so immersed.

As for the Opera singer dressed as an overgrown bush, Driss certainly put things into perspective there, getting Philippe and the audience of the film into mild hysterics, (also in the birthday party scene, likening a certain bit of Classical music to the sound track of Tom and Jerry - now that was a classic !)

It is the story of the friendship between a paraplegic and a caregiver. It is warm, well acted and generous. The main reason I liked it is that both heroes grow from the experience. It is well acted.

He gave him his life back rather than medciate him so he can slowly die everyday like they do with the elderly here.  Shame on the U.S.  Let's overmedicate our elderly and sick rather than try to give life meaning as people age.  Medicare in U.S. is pathetic and the politicians have the nerve to try to cut more for the elderly.  I say let's cut the politicians health care in Washington and see how they like it.

Too often all we see is the suffering and heartbreak. This movie is all about the joy of life and how if we actually treat people like human beings no matter what state their bodies may be in and screw feeling sorry for them...well, you get a simply great movie.

The revelation is Omar Sy as the Senegalese French guy hired by Mr. Rich Wheelchair to be his arms and legs really. The guy carries the movie by proving to be not only adept at playing humor but also the tough guy. Basically, you put Sy in any movie, I guarantee it'll be worth watching. The guy is that good.

Oh, yeah, did I forget to mention it is a comedy. There some classic bits and the entire supporting cast is a lot of fun as well.

As far as the extras, I leave that to someone else as my DVD copy from the library has terrible tracking problems. I, in fact, gave up, paid the $5 and watched the flick on Video On Demand in the end.",1372982400,,1039,4.211055276381909

My daughters and I watched the French version with English subtitles. We noticed that they left out translations for one of the more ""politically sensitive"" comments made during the shaving scene at the end of the movie. That was disappointing, because it was one of the most irreverant and funny statements in the whole movie.

The fact that neither one cares for the other one's good opinion creates constant opportunities for poking fun, even with the serious themes underneath.  Later, after the relationship establishes between the two men, the verbal fencing which has become such an integral part of their interaction is still sharp edged, timely and, likely, universally human.

I am French, so I have known this film for few years now and I absolutely love it.
I wanted to buy it with English subtitles to make a present to some very close friends that are not french. I can't wait to watch it with them now!

This is one of the movie, French cinema can be proud of and I think everyone should see it. It deals with serious subjects without being too serious.

I am surprised reading the reviews that a subtitled film can be a reason for not viewing a film ! Come on ! Are you serious ? Do you think most people that just don't speak english are only watching movies in their own languague ? No they watched subtitled films and not only once in their life but almost every time they want to see a movie! And it is not horrible to do so.

I'm buying this movie because I know that I will watch it over and over.  The relationship between these two men, one a paraplegic, the other, a black man, poor, living in the projects and unemployed after doing time in prison for robbery. I would've loved this movie even if it was fiction but the fact that it's a true story blew me away.  It's part fall down laughing funny and bring tears to your eyes poignant.

4951640,2,B0064JV4RY,"Once in a while a movie comes along... that makes me feel blind.

This beautifully shot movie is not without great acting and charm. Driss (Omar Sy) is pure charisma and Philippe (Francois Cluzet)'s performance is, while too understated, nuanced. Some scenes were really well-done. I'll look for other films with these amazing actors.

Beyond this, however, I just can't see what others see in this movie. It is a heart-warming story, sorta, but so many movies have been here before; this is the Bucket List and the Odd Couple mixed in with five made-for-TV movies about a challenged person who needs a bit of sass in their life, provided by an uncouth companion. Driss' bullies his way through the movie and everyone just finds it endearing.  There he is assaulting the neighbor. There he is manhandling and humiliating the boss' daughter's boyfriend. Why? Well, because. Oh, Driss. Is he pouring hot water on Philippe's legs because he can't feel a thing? It's OK because it's amusing to him. By the way, is Philippe's daughter acting like a brat and doing drugs? No problem, Driss is offering to smack her a few times, and well, Philippe won't mind, she has it coming. And the caring nice guy nurse who takes over after Driss? Oh, no patience for that caring jerk. I seriously felt at the end that every character in the Philippe household, especially Philippe, was a secret submissive  masochist.

Oh wait: besides his pizazz and lack of education, he turned out to be a really good painter. You know, because he worked at it for a week or two. So there, give him $30K for the doodle fancy artsy people like; he deserves it because... because he is Driss, get it? And the movie goes on like this! It is so outrageous that it's almost objectifying to the character. Why is everyone so happy and willing to play second fiddle to a thug? Try as he might the man just can do no wrong.

Here's the compelling point: there was nothing during the initial interview that justified to the viewer that Driss should have gotten the job and if he had turned out to be a psychotic killer who stole (well, he actually did that too), raped and murdered a few in the household nobody would/should have been surprised.

(SPOILER AHEAD) To add insult, there is some Hollywood kitsch here as well. Oh, Driss you charmy womanizer, so you like Philippe's secretary? Well she'll flirt with you through the whole movie but guess what: she's a lesbian! How do you like THAT? But wait, she'll hint that she might be into something kinky after all (wink-wink!)... This tripe is so unoriginal and trite is hardly worth commenting on. But this is what passes for funny in this movie.

I find it very surprising this has been such a smash hit, especially in Europe where so many sophisticated yet watchable gems have been released in the last several years. Even here, most of the negative reviews complain about the movie being in French or an unplayable DVD, nothing about the lack of substance of this film. This is the most over-rated and over-hyped movie since Slum Dog Millionaire; it is as simplistic (more so actually) and just as contrived.

Am I blind to the genius of this movie? Not really, apparently, sometimes the rest of the world is just wrong.",1370822400,14,3236,4.663157894736842
4951641,5,B0064JV4RY,"I started to watch the movie a few weeks ago, and couldn't get past the first scenes of a Maserati racing through city streets, driven by a black man with an older bearded white man in the passenger seat. The dialogue in French with English subtitles made it even more difficult to latch onto the plot. I started again a few weeks later and became entranced with the story of Philippe and Driss.

The real story starts to unfold when Driss is seated along a wall in a sumptuously decorated lobby, the only black man among an array of better dressed white men. He becomes impatient, storms into the inner office and insists that they sign his paper indicating that he had applied for a job, so that he could show it as proof in order to get on public assistance. He is told to come back the next day, and is hired on the spot to become the caregiver for Philippe, a wheelchair-bound wealthy paraplegic. All we know about Driss is that he has recently been released from jail after doing 6 months for theft and has been kicked out of his family home. He has no prior caregiver experience, but he is young and strong and does not treat Philippe like a pitiable invalid.

Driss soon learns all of the daily tasks that he needs to perform to bathe, groom and feed Philippe and there are many humorous moments along the way. He never treats Philippe roughly, nor does he treat him like a frail old man. He makes mistakes, he curses unabashedly and he has a sense of wonder and awe at the rich, privileged world he has been plopped into. One day, when preparing to take Philippe for an outing, he refuses to take the wheelchair-accessible minivan and insists on driving the powerful, sleek Maserati instead. Philippe enjoys watching Driss' boyish excitement at piloting such a macho car, and they enjoy many rides together.

Philippe also has a cadre of other assistants, including a secretary, house manager, business manager and gardener. Initially they all are very skeptical about the loud, crude, big black man that has moved in; however his boyish charm and enthusiasm soon weave their magic on them, and they learn to accept him. He adds so much life and humor to what had been a sad, quiet place. He teaches Philippe to find humor in his situation and even to laugh at himself from time to time. The backstory of both characters is revealed through many outings, adventures and conversations.

Without revealing any more of the plot, I will just conclude that this is a joyful love story on many levels. The unlikely pairing of a rich, white, cultured handicapped man and a poor, uneducated and uncouth black man creates a unique relationship that benefits both men. ""Intouchables"" is based on a true story; otherwise you would not believe that such a rare relationship could develop and thrive. Their lives are forever changed for the better.",1370822400,,2844,4.648111332007952

The two main characters are unique and complicated in their own ways; they literally come from two different worlds, so the growth in their friendship and their understanding of each other is quite fascinating.  They are both able to handle their issues through humor and relying on each other.

4951700,5,B0064JV4RY,"A global crowd pleaser to be sure, this based-on-real-events story avoids the clutches of emotional manipulation which would have been its downfall.  Instead, the two primary characters mesh their cultural differences into an upbeat story of life and its challenges.

Phillippe (Francois Cluzet) is a wealthy quadriplegic, injured in a hang gliding accident.  He and his attractive secretary (Audrey Fleurot) are interviewing men who will aid Phillippe with dressing, bathing and other hygiene concerns.  Among the interviewees is Driss (Omar Sy) who immigrated to France from Senegal as a boy.  Driss has grown up on the streets and is a small time hoodlum whose mother has kicked him out of their crowded apartment.

Driss has no intention of getting the job, but needs a signature saying he was there so that he can get his unemployment check.  Surprisingly, Phillippe likes the guy's smart ass attitude and he's hired.  At this point, there is no question where this will head but the journey is a good one.

Phillippe gets a renewed sense of adventure as Driss drives his boss's Maserati dangerously through the Parisian streets.  And then Driss sets Phillippe up on a date with an unseen correspondent.  Driss is introduced to the fine arts of classical music, opera and painting.  As their worlds collide they are also expanded in different directions.  Written and directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, the film is beautifully photographed and acted with joy and warmth.  An excellent supporting cast headed by Anne Le Ny as Phillippes household manager contributes to his charming film.  One of the best of 2012.

I'm pleasantly surprised at the excellent quality of this Blu Ray transfer which come in 1080p resolution with an original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  In a nutshell the film is beautiful to watch.  It is rare that I pay much attention to the detail of clothing and accessories, but this transfers makes patterns pop off suits and jackets.  The colors are perfect and the clarity is first rate throughout.  Remarkable stuff.  I'm equally impressed by the care taken with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio option.  Again surprising for an indi movie that relies primarily on dialog.  Music is central to the story however as Driss is a big fan of Earth Wind and Fire and other dance music from America.  Phillippe is a fan of classical and often has small orchestras perform at his home.  There is a funny scene at the opera.  So yes, there is plenty of music and it is well represented in the audio.  Excellent package which makes the film a great one to own.  The only thing missing are extras for those who are looking for them.  Just some deleted scenes and the usual handful of trailers.",1369526400,,2716,4.8818380743982495

It fascinated me to find that the true life story involves an Algerian national and the aristocrat however I guess for political reasons this was not implemented in this movie.

4951732,5,B0064JV4RY,"No wonder ""poignant"" is a french word. There's very little I can add to what other reviewers haven't already said. I'm usually a movie skeptic; I dislike mushy cliches and predictability, but in all honesty, this film's story and dialogue was original enough (truth, or a dramatized version of it, will always be stranger than fiction) to surpass all the turnoffs. It definitely is ""feel good"", but not too corny and exaggerated. I think the strength of this film is its ability to deliver poignancy in a witty, un-PC and unapologetic way. I can totally imagine the movie bombing or diminished to some formulaic Hollywood tripe in less capable hands.

SPOILERS: One thing that kinda bothered me is how he often crossed the boundary of what's acceptable into misdemeanors (like theft, shoving, and aggressive flirting, which could be construed as sexual harassment). I find it hard to believe no one pushed back on him or gave him some stern warnings or threaten to terminate him....but maybe his personality won him over. Or maybe they left those parts out of the screenplay.

All in all great film, fantastic score and cinematography, superb dialogue and acting, it's another addition to my list of favorites.",1368662400,3,1210,4.985148514851486

It's a work of art as well as a celebration and enjoyment of art.  The music is enchanting.  I really like classical music but don't listen to it very often.

The French film uses subtitles and they didn't bother me at all. Both of the main actors were endearing and loveable especially in the funny scenes. Bravo for the film's director and cast.

I'm not going to give you the story here.  You can go to IMDB for that.  What I am going to suggest is that you give this film a try.

You laugh, you cry, you get mad, you empathize, sympathize, and want to just be around these guys.  I loved the progression from employee/employer to closest friends, almost like family. I love the humor involved and how the attendant who came from a poor background just cannot relate to the ""niceties"" of the ultra rich. My only complaint is that I was left a bit confused when the attendant's nephew/cousin came for him. That was not really clear enough because I kept expecting him to return to work.

The primary characters are a VERY wealthy, well educated, quadriplegic  gentleman with a brilliant mind, a great sense of humor and warmth, and his nurse/caregiver, a young, poor, black man who becomes a lifelong friend.  The caregiver frees his patient from feeling dependent and restricted by his devastating physical situation: he gives him adventure, excitement, fun and life again. He never treats his ward like a cripple, but rather jokes with him irreverently about his circumstances.  He also introduces him to the tastes and challenges of his own black subculture.

This film is SO much fun!  So touching.  Both characters grow and learn and risk.  I laughed so hard, that some scenes left me in tears  (or was I crying from emotional release?)

4951848,5,B0064JV4RY,"After reading the reviews and watching some of the previews of the film, I could not wait to receive The Intouchables. I knew I was not going to be disappointed. There are quite a few priceless scenes and without spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it, the Maserati scene really conveys the spirit of the interaction between Driss and Philippe right off the bat. Driss' charismatic personality and Philippe's facial reactions and dry comments to some of the outlandish things Driss does throughout this film are so entertaining.  Another one of my favorite scenes is when Driss dances.  Anyone who can't get up and move to Earth, Wind & Fire's Boogie Wonderland would have to be in Philippe's condition and you can see how he longingly looks at Driss and wishes he could participate too! Driss moves like liquid across the dance floor so effortlessly and I loved how his charisma and talent affects the other members of Philippe's staff to get up and begin dancing egged on by Driss to celebrate the party.

I felt Cluzet, who played Philippe, did an excellent job portraying a quadriplegic which is not an easy task as he had to rely solely on his facial emotions/comments to carry each scene which he does effortlessly. I could not get over his resemblance to Dustin Hoffman in a couple of scenes.  I loved the interaction between the two men and some of the other staff members as well, in particular Magalie, the red-head, who Driss has the hots for. The movie does not disappoint when it is revealed later Magalie's choice in partners to Driss' surprise after his endless pursuit of her.

The score of the film was done by one of my favorite musicians and composer, Italian Ludovico Einaudi, who is an absolute genius.  His minimal style was exactly what was needed in the background so as not to detract from what was going on in the film itself.

All in all, this is a movie not to miss. Prepare to be entertained and captivated by this true story!",1365984000,,1958,4.641618497109826

4951851,5,B0064JV4RY,"I'm always pleased when I come across something that surprises me and makes me smile out of the blue. The only sad part about the movie I'm writing about this week is that it's a French film. Why is that sad? Because there are far too many people in this world who won't take the chance, won't take the time and won't pay attention to what they're watching enough to see this film. Once they learn they'll have to read subtitles they'll pass it by. The sad thing is in doing so they'll miss one of the best movies of this past year. So take a chance, please.

THE INTOUCHABLES is the story of Driss (Omar Sy), a young black man recently released from jail and living in the low income housing area of Paris. The story opens with Driss seemingly applying for a job taking care of a wealthy quadriplegic man named Phillipe (Francois Cluzet). Phillipe is bored with each applicant and known for being a task master. When Driss comes in just asking them to sign his welfare papers so he can collect, Phillipe tells him to come back the next day.

Driss returns home to have his mother ask him to leave because of his past. With several brothers and sisters, he does so in the hopes of helping them. The next morning he returns to Phillipe's home and is told he's being hired temporarily to see if he works out. Most of the staff doesn't think he'll make it. But Phillipe see's something in him that the rest don't. More than that he knows Driss will offer him more honesty and straight forwardness than the rest of the staff.

Driss is amazed at his living conditions first. It's the first time he's had a room of his own let alone a custom bathroom for his own use. As Driss goes about his first day, he does indeed offer no ounce of sympathy for Phillipe and talks to him like any other person he would me. Phillipe finds this incredibly refreshing and actually finds something to smile about in the presence of Driss. Driss begins to learn Phillipe's daily routine and how things work around the house.

As the days go by the pair become not only employer and employee but friends as well. Both try to educate the other about the differences that they have. Where Phillipe attempts to expose Driss to opera and classical music, Driss tunes Phillipe into groups like Earth Wind & Fire. They come from different worlds but they find enjoyment in each other's company.

One of the tasks that Phillipe does each week is to write a letter to a lady pen pal he's been wooing for the past 6 months. Filled with expressions of romance Driss can't believe he's not tried to meet her and sets about doing so by calling her and then passing the phone to Phillipe. A meeting is scheduled but no one knows for sure what will happen.

The same is true of Driss' past catching up to him. Concerned about his family and the chance that his brother may turn up like him he keeps an eye on them from the sidelines and eventually must make a decision just who needs help more, his brother or Phillipe.

Through it all the Driss and Phillipe share small adventures that show both have a sense of wonder still and a love of life. Though confined to his wheelchair and unable to move anything but his head and neck, Phillipe learns to smile and laugh again.

There is a certain joy about this film that rubs off after viewing it. You'll find yourself literally laughing out loud at moments. I know I did. Best of all will be the life affirming knowledge that the film was based on a true story. What became of the pair is revealed just before the credits.

Acting is something that transcends language. The facial expressions and moves of an actor in film show that it is a visual art form rather than just the sounds made vocally. Yes, the things they say in this film will make you laugh but coupled with the actions both actors offer great performances here.

Nominated around the world for awards it's sad that it wasn't nominated for best foreign picture at this year's Academy Awards. It should have won hands down. So don't be afraid to try something different. Don't let the fact that this film is French scare you away. Take a moment and enjoy the story and laugh at all it has to offer. Easily one of the best films I've seen this past year.",1365897600,,4228,4.402048655569782

I did really love the humor and bonding of these two main characters of the movie. There is no such a thing as racism as some critic pointed out. Being employed by a rich man is not racist.

We thought(feared?) the movie would have a predictable ending...happy to be wrong and thoroughly enjoyed the journey.

The two protagonists, the quadriplegic musician and the ex-con turned good samaritan despite himself are as well matched as a violin and cello in a quartet. Opposites attract and this becomes almost a buddy film. From the opening car chase to the heart-warming ending you root for the two heroes.

The story may sound familiar (a guy with a ""past"" and some demons of his own becoming the caretaker for a paraplegic in a wheelchair who has the money to afford top notch care, but sees something special in this man who interviews for the job.

It is a phenomenal story of two people, who become friends in the unlikely circumstances.  The young black man, enters a world of opulence and a world of challenge.  Not only must he be available 24 hours a day for a quadriplegic but he must learn to deal with crisis that he has never been challenged with before.  His good nature proves to be a tonic to a lonely man, trapped and isolated by his injuries.  Together, they embrace those things that are still fun - skydiving, racing cars and love all at the encouragement of the helper.  They are truly kindred spirits.
This is the kind of movie you sigh because it ended.  You cry a little for the fact that these two seemly unlike people have bonded in friendship that is found once maybe twice in a lifetime if you are lucky.

4951904,5,B0064JV4RY,"'Intouchabes' is a moving story of characters from all walks who perceive life in certain ways, convincing themselves into believing they are principles. From the rich invalid who accepts his limitations and even unnecessarily imposing more of the same on himself, he has settled into even the most vicarious of relationships, an epistolary one with a woman unseen.
Along comes Driss, so full of convictions: he is unemployable, will not put on another's support stockings, all attractive women find him irresistible, hang gliding is insane and certainly would not consider taking care of an invalid's most personal, basic needs.
All of this understandable. We get into life's routines which are most comfortable and focus on directing our activities to emphasize them. Then life throws people into circumstances which break down those barriers, some of the strongest with surprising ease. The foundation of the relationship between the two characters is established and once the trust is established, they proceed to explore what other limitations can and need to be eliminated. Laughter begins to fill the mansion, sacred bonds are examined like Phillipe's relationship with his adopted daughter.
Life begins anew for both. Little things are symbolic like stuffy opera and classical music contrasted with dancing to Earth, Wind and Fire at a birthday party. Driss is fearless in all aspects of life until he encounters hang gliding. Having singularly described himself as 'pragmatic' in an interview, accepting some semi parachute float him far from where his feet are firmly on the ground is forbidden territory. With Nina Simone helping out, his fears turn to exhilaration as expressed by ""I'm having a blast"".
We would not expect a stuffy, rich invalid to smoke dope and find it opens new perspectives, yet it does physically and spiritually as now he can truly breathe and laugh.
But then the compromise Driss makes to work to the point where this had become a new 'principle' is shattered by his family life. Always a priority for him, his family has had been sacrificed in order to fulfill these obligations, but in the end so as to take care of them it is recognized and accepted he has to be with them.
In route, Driss finds out why the hot red head he has been pining for has resisted his most earnest affections. Phillipe has to give up Driss and again compromise by accepting a inadequate substitute caregiver, as useless and inane as the resumes of the rest.
The invalid finally meets his literary companion to close out that limiting aspect of his life - due to no small effort by Driss who by now does not work for him but is driven to see the relationship have a chance.
As we relive replaying the car ride from the beginning, there is an underlying uneasiness about its purpose and how it will end. Again we are reminded: this story is about living life and leaving the alternatives behind. That will not be compromised.
Enjoyable movie that forces the viewer to suspend credulity but discard disbelief because in the end it works. The movie requires faith up until the point where we want this relationship to work and in the end our faith in the human spirit is renewed.",1364688000,,3190,4.898336414048059

4951912,5,B0064JV4RY,"When filmmakers Olivier Nakache and &Eacute;ric Toledano discovered the documentary ""A la vie, a la mort"", they discovered a touching story about a wealthy quadriplegic French Aristocrat named Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caretaker, an ex-con named Abdel Sellou.

A paragliding accident that left di Borgo, the former director of the Pommery champagne house and second son of a French duke having an ex-con as his caretaker was a story you you don't see often.  But it was because of Abdel being vain, arrogant and someone who didn't feel sorry for him.  Which in the dozens and dozens of people that were interviewed to be a caretaker, most felt sorry for him.  But for Abdel, he was full of humor and made di Borgo feel life and brought happiness to his life because he was unexpected.

And so the story goes, as Nakache and Toledano crafted a screenplay after the documentary but also the experiences of di Borgo from his best selling book ""You Changed My Life"", they visited di Borgo to read their script and di Borgo helped bring realism to the script (while some fictional experiences were added for comedy).  But with Di Borgo's go ahead, the film was made and would star actor Francois Cluzet (""Tell No One"", ""Little White Lies"", ""French Kiss""), Omar Sy (""Micmacs"", ""Those Happy Days""), Ann Le Ny (""The Tste of Others"", ""Declaration of War"") and Audrey Fleurot (""Midnight in Paris"", ""Un Village Francais"").

The film would receive international critical acclaim.  The film won ""Best Film"" and ""Best Actor"" for both Cluzet and Sy at the Tokyo International Film Festival, Best Actor at the Cesar Awards and the film became the third highest grossing film in France, the highest-grossing movie in a language other than English worldwide, surpassing the record set by the animated film ""Spirited Away"" and also becoming the top grossing foreign language film of 2012 in North America.  While the film would stay at #1 in German for nine consecutive weeks, Switzerland for eleven weeks and multiple weeks for many other countries.

Suffice to say, the film was a financial box office success for Gaumont and in the U.S., the film's rights for an American remake were purchased by the Weinstein Co.  And now this award winning film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2013 courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

VIDEO:

""The Intouchables"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  The film looks fantastic as skin tone are natural, black levels are nice and deep.  Closeups show amazing detail,  the film is colorful sharp and if anything, because of the multiple locations of where this film was shot, the cinematography by Mathieu Vadepieed (""Read My Lips"", ""In Your Hands"") was beautifully shot.  I detected no aliasing or artifacts during my viewing of this film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Intouchables"" is presented in French 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The dialogue for the film is crystal clear and while the film is dialogue driven, also good use of music with a wonderful score by Ludovico Einaudi (""This is England"", ""Insidious"", ""Aprile"") and Earth, Wind and Fire coming clearly in lossles.  There are scenes with ambiance of crowds or car engine revving but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack is appropriate for this film.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Intouchables"" come with the following special features:

  Deleted Scenes - (5:35) Featuring five deleted scenes

EXTRAS:

""The Intouchables"" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows for one to download their film to a computer or on select Apple and Android devices and to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Quite often you hear about a hype of a film, you wonder if its warranted.  It's one thing to hear a lot of hype when it comes from America but when a film begins to make an impact in several countries and stays at #1 for consecutive weeks, you know that the film must be special.

And after watching ""The Intouchables"", I have to agree, this film is magnificent!

Everything works so well with the film, from its writing, the humor, the outstanding performances by Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy but it's a storyline that you just never see too often. When it comes to films about paraplegic, the truth is that many films are about perseverance and having compassion for that person who was left injured and trying to manage life.

But ""The Intouchables"" doesn't do that.  This is about an ex-convict who went into a job not for the sake of getting it, but for the sake of getting a rejection, having his paper signed in order to receive unemployment benefits.

But it's the story of how a person, no matter how different they are, coming to a person's life at a time when they desperately need it.

The character of Driss is in need of a job, a place to stay after getting kicked out of his apartment by his aunt, but what begins as a business relationship between caretaker and client, it became a relationship of friends in which Driss never treated Philippe with pity, he treated him like a normal guy, not afraid to crack jokes about staff or people, or even if he's in a wheelchair.

The real Philippe that the film is based on said it perfectly in his interview with the UK Telegraph news publication about how important his caretaker was for him.  Philippe said, ""He treated me like I needed to be treated in the tough times ahead, partly because of my condition but also because my wife was dying of cancer [she died three years after his accident]. I needed to be back on track. Pity is the last thing you need. Pity is hopeless. Pity is what someone gives you because he is afraid to take care of you. I didn't need that. But compassion I don't need also. It comes from Latin and means `suffering with'. I don't want you to be suffering with me. I need consolation, which in Latin means keeping me as a whole person, respecting me as I am.""

The film is magnificent for the fact that it's an unlikely pairing, but its the growing relationship of these two men of how one is able to bring this man out of the darkness and enjoy life once again.

One scene has Driss jogging while Philippe is trying to catch up with his wheelchair.  Not so thrilled that the wheelchair is slow, they modify it to make it go much faster.

Another scene featured Philippe wanting to get away and take part in skydiving and Driss of course, is not interested but eventually for the sake of Philippe, he does it anyway.

There are so many of these random moments of kindness that you don't expect from Driss, even tricking Philippe into smoking a joint or hiring beautiful Asian masseuses to work on him and his ears (which give him pleasure).

This is a feel-good movie with a lot of charm and a lot of soul and it's a film that leaves you feeling happy and appreciative that you saw a film so enjoyable.  Sure, ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""The King's Speech"" or ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" and perhaps other films may come to mind, as this style of movie has been done before.  Sure, the film could have been more melodramatic, more serious but it wasn't.  It's a film that manages not to be too sad but has its interjection of humor and with the two wonderful performances by both Cluzet and Sy,  you can't help but feel captivated with what you saw.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic, colorful and well-detailed and lossless audio was also crystal clear when it came to dialogue and music.  I did wish there were more special features included for a film that has received so much attention internationally.  Only five deleted scenes, no audio commentary, no featurettes, nothing.  So, if there was any low-point for this Blu-ray release, it's the lack of special features.

I know that a few may find the film a bit repulsive that a caretaker would make fun of his paraplegic client in a certain manner, some that did not happen to the real Philippe but were featured in the film for comedy-sake, but through interviews I have read about Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caretaker, Abdel Sellou... this is what di Borgo needed, a caretaker who didn't treat him with pity or compassion, but on equal ground.  And that is why those two had that bond!

While an American remake of ""The Intouchables"" is being planned, ""The Intouchables"" worked as a French film, as an American film, then things get a bit murky as people will question racial stereotypes, offensive treatment towards paraplegics and that it would have a negative impact for those in that industry.

""The Intouchables"" is not about race, not about disability, yes...one man in Black, one man is not.  One is disabled, the other is not.  One man is wealthy, the other is not.  Critic reviews from Europe differ from America as the race/stereotype issue is brought up here in the U.S.  But this is a film not about racial hatred or a film about poking fun on a severe disability, it's a movie about hope and no matter how these two individuals were raised, it's how they are when they were together and the fact that as in real life and as in the film, this caretaker was able to bring Philippe, something that he thought he had lost... happiness.

""The Intouchables"" is recommended!",1364601600,5,9236,4.698136645962733

Based on a true story, an unlikely friendship is forged between Driss and Philippe shared with emotion, adventure, struggle and humor.

4951927,4,B0064JV4RY,"Les Intouchables relates the largely true story of how Philippe, a rich Parisian man who is paraplegic after a paragliding accident, hires Driss, an unemployed young man from a troubled suburb to be his assistant. In the film Driss is from Senegal; in real life he was Algerian. Driss, who only applied for the job so he can be eligible for benefit payment, is at first both bored and horrified by what he expected to do: feed, clean and drive around a man with no feeling below his neck. Driss shows no sympathy or pity for Philippe's handicap and pushes him to become more adventurous. For example, he ditches the boring van and starts driving around Paris in Philippe's Maserati, and presses his boss to set up a meeting with a woman penpal he's never seen. As the film progresses the two men develop a deepening friendhship. All the time though Driss is aware that his family - he is the eldest of several children of a single mother - is vulnerable and it becomes clear a younger brother is falling into the hands of a drugs ring. I don't want to give away the ending but the film doesn't pull its punches. This delightful and warm movie broke all sorts of box office records in France and is highly recommended.",1364256000,,1217,4.51131221719457

4951929,5,B0064JV4RY,"""Intouchables"" is so real - if Hollywood had produced this story, there would have been several opportunities for excessive drama, even violence. However, one of the great things about this film is that it does not feel forced at all. It drew me straight in and kept me hooked the entire time (and not just because I had to be sure not to miss subtitles).

I know other reviews have already mentioned these words, but I find myself listing the same simply because there's no other way to describe this film! Beautiful, touching, poignant, moving, unique, real, well-acted, well-written, and how cool is it that it's based on a true story?? Love it.

If you, like me, tend to shy away from movies that appear to require a giant box of tissues, fear not! It's more of a sweet movie than sad.",1364256000,,789,4.549295774647887

The man who is hired by him is not a person who feels sorry for him.  The man wanted someone who would not feel sorry for him.  Believe it or not, it is a comedy filled with tons of caring and sweetness.  It will go down as one of the top movies I have ever seen in my life.

But these two amazing actors make ""The Intouchables"" so much more interesting and honest than that. It's the story of a friendship that makes both men into good men -- but with the emotional ride of a love story.

4952025,4,B0064JV4RY,"This film has a great deal of emotional baggage that is felt by and pushed by the audience. A true story it is said, and it does give the human relationships a positive spin.

 Philippe, played by Francois Cluzet, is a millionaire who was paralyzed from the neck down in a para-gliding accident. Driss, played by Omar Sy is a man out on parole for robbery, who applies for the job of Philippe's caregiver only so he can get a signature on his application for unemployment benefits. What Philippe needs is not only physical help but someone to cheer him up. Phillipe dares Driss to take the job for a month,and off they go. Driss is irreverent and clueless at times, and Phillipe is taking quite a chance. But, then, what does he have to lose?

Off they go on adventures. Driss  pushes Phillipe through the Parisian night when Phillipe has an anxiety attack. They partake of cultural activities, art, opera, birthday parties and dating. Driss has the feet, Phillipe has the mind and money. This partnership is something each of them needs, and is an equalizer. One issue is the black/white divide, rich/poor divide. Not much is said of it, but it is there, staring us right in the face.

This is a feel good film, tears at times, but the stupors is refreshing and a good time. The two actors,superb. Francois Cluzot, who plays Phillipe, moves only his face, and his remarkable features set the pace. Omar Sy the devil may care, Driss, and the man who is always moving, always looking for a woman. These two have chemistry, and the film is a good one.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-16-13",1363392000,4,1587,4.609929078014185

Philippe is the rich benevolent quadriplegic who hires Driss - a young Senegalese from the banlieu of Paris.  This could be your typical unlikely partnership that flowers into friendship.  However, the actors play with such emotion and genuine camaraderie that the story rises to another level.  One sees that Driss adds color and adventure back into Philippe's life while Philippe helps Driss discover purpose and responsibility in his life.

4952052,5,B0064JV4RY,"If you found yourself wading through the mainstream reviews of The Intouchables in the American press, I doubt you would even recognize this magnificent film. From what is a remarkable, mesmerizing and poignant tribute to the power of authentic human connection over the paralysis of fear, lovelessness and ennui, Variety and The New York Times among others, choose to see this truth-based relationship between an aristocratic French quadriplegic and his street-tough black caregiver as a red, white and blue meme to the continuing plague of racial stereotyping and class-based exploitation.

As Jerry Lewis has learned the hard way over decades, America ain't France and I would therefore most humbly suggest to the lions of professional judgment that they view the film without the baggage and institutionalized biases that overwhelm their own criticisms of it. What the critics-for-hire anticipated was the stillborn, racial clownishness of Eddie Murphy and Judge Reinhold in Beverly Hills Cop - what the film delivered was something real and touching that they couldn't explain, so they forced their original narrative anyway.

I am the first one to roll may eyes at any film that is overwrought by any political or ham handed social agenda - thankfully, this screenwriter borne virus is not an issue with this film.

The Intouchables is the rare film where you know from the first five minutes that you are watching something special. The subtitles melt quickly into the background as the real-world relationship between billionaire Philippe and reluctant caregiver Driss is propelled by the bravura performances of actors Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy. The proceedings elevate further as the bone-dry subtlety of the highly intelligent, serio-comic screenplay of writers Oliver Nakache and Eric Toledano crackles with prescient insight.

The Intouchables is in fact a genuine ""feel good"" film that mass-audience populars like Silver Linings Playbook can only aspire to. Playbook, while enjoyable to watch, allows powerful star-turn acting to be habitually hamstrung by too cute by half emotional manipulation and story-line choreography that delivers every player to their predestined against-all-odds triumph that even the dullest member of the audience could have easily predicted.

Time will tell whether the must-see Intouchables cracks my personal top ten. In the meantime, enjoy and savor this rare treat of a film.",1362960000,4,2425,5.456

4952066,4,B0064JV4RY,"""One of the few foreign films I have seen in quite some time (after the Indonesian film, The Raid), Intouchables, one of the highest-grossing French films of all time (at $400+ million worldwide) stands as one of the most significant films recently on my must-see list. After a long wait for the Region 1 DVD, Intouchables is a great, surprisingly hilarious, and rather watchable effort that does not really disappoint. Sy as the ballsy and confident Driss provides a performance that encapsulates a character who is funny, aware, and a realist. Cluzet provides a believable and ironic performance as Philippe showcasing his disability also signals his lack of amusement and sarcastic views about life. Even with positive feedback, the film does notably suffer from a precise narrative that emphasises on how Philippe came to be paraplegic and how he went to the hospital toward the end. The film, while it may deal with the struggles between the high-class and low-class, is not really politically-charged and controversial (as a film like La Haine would) more than it is an Oscar-like comedy-drama about human emotions and feelings dealing with disability, economic status, negligence, culture, family, and work ethics. Altogether, considering the fact that it mutes any direct politics, the film is best watched as a guilty pleasure given its positive, sometimes carefree perspective about life. Given this reason, it is no wonder why the film performed so well in Europe and even Australia and South Korea. Even if you are afraid of subtitles, the film will not make you look away or feel bored one bit when you see Driss make daily ends meet through following experimental methods of caring for Philippe and enhances his pretentious lifestyle.""",1362787200,,1749,5.140350877192983

Written and directed by Olivier Nakache and ric Toledano the film was inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in `A la vie,  la mort', a documentary film. Of note, the book version of the film's story was written and released after the film enjoyed great success. Written by Abdel Sellou the book  `You Saved My Life' tells the extraordinary true story of the charming Algerian con-man' friendship with a disabled French aristocrat. Sellou's book shows the real man behind Sellou/Driss's smiling face. The book takes us from his childhood spent stealing candy from the local grocery store, to his career as a pickpocket and scam artist, to his unexpected employment as a companion for a quadriplegic. Sellou has never before divulged the details of his past.  In many interviews and documentaries, he has evaded or shrugged off the question of his childhood and his stay in prison, until now. He tells his story with a stunning amount of talent, with humor, style, and--though he denies that he has any--humility. Abdel Sellou now lives in Algeria with his wife and three children, where he runs a chicken farm. He remains close to Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who lives in Morocco with his second wife and two children.

The cinematic version of this relationship is an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility. After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident the aristocratic intellectual Parisian millionaire Philippe (Franois Cluzet) is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude ex-con African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Philippe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance. Philippe, impressed that Driss is the only candidate who does not look at him with pity, challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Philippe and his employees, especially under the watchful and compassionate eye of the head of the house staff Yvonne (Anne Le Ny). As Driss reluctantly learns to move, feed, and clean Philippe, the two men discover a blunt but vital humor that not only bridges the cultural and class divide between them, but gives Philippe a renewed joy in life - and a chance to turn his passionate epistolary relationship with one Eleanore whom he has never seen into a chance at a second go at life.

The only aspect of this film that is somewhat distracting is that the film opens with a car adventure involving both Philippe and Dris which is terrific film making and very funny but does make the film's beginning (after the credits) seem less surprising.  A very minor point, especially when the film ends with the same activity but this time drives it to an incredibly touching completion.  Highly recommended on every level: both Franois Cluzet  and Omar Sy are brilliant!  Grady Harp, March 13",1362614400,,3488,4.848739495798319

It's not only entertaining from beginning to end but the feeling you get from this story lasts long after the movie is over.  The Intouchables is based on the true story of an unexpected friendship that forms between a wealthy paraplegic and a young man from the slums of Paris who has surprisingly been hired to be his caregiver.  This story will leave you bursting with energy to go after everything you can get out of life.  Even if you think you've lost it all, there's always so much more.

4952113,5,B0064JV4RY,"Okay, so there are already 44 reviews of this film before this review - and all are raving about it. Well, I have to jump on the band wagon too! I watched this French film last night knowing nothing and couldn't stop laughing for the full 122 minutes. A funny and sweet comedy about a quadriplegic? Only the French could pull this off.  And it's based on a true story.
You may have already read other reviews her which describe the plot - whether in summary or detail - but, to be honest, it's best to discover what happens on the screen for yourself, so I won't give anything away, except to say that if the first five minutes - which occurs before the title even appears don't get you interested, then I'll be surprised. (And the great soundtrack adds a lot to the ""feel good"" feeling of the film.)
Be aware that Amazon groups reviews of ALL versions of a release - whether DVD, Bluray, NTSC, with subtitles or without - so be careful to read the description of the release being reviewed. That said, this review is of the Blu-ray version being released on March 5th with English Subtitles.
If there is one caveat I will make for those watching the film on a standard definition TV, it is that this is another recent case where the English subtitles are in white print directly on the screen image and not very large. The size is not the issue but there are quite a few scenes where the scenery is white and the subtitles are quite hard to read. I have to say that even on my 27in standard format TV, I missed about 5% of the dialogue (but I could still follow the story). Other recent foreign films I've reviewed recently have subtitles in green or the words are placed below the image, making it easy to read.

Both the DVD and BD have the same single ""Special Feature"". It is a series of four deleted scenes. These total about six minutes. What is really odd is that the deleted scenes have subtitles which - though white - are at least 50% larger than the ones in the film and have a sharper contrast.

No, I'm not deducting any stars - the film is that great that I'm just commenting on the subtitles. This is already my favorite film of 2012 and my bet to with the Oscar for Best Foreign Film! I'm sure those of you who have pre-ordered it through Amazon (remember you want the one with ENGLISH subtitles and NTSC) will find it well worth the wait.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4952138,5,B0064JV4RY,"Obviously the publicized 1/15/13 US release date has been rescheduled.

Amazon UK now has a release date of February 4, 2013 - which is moved back a week from its previous release date of 1/28/13. That release date is related to the required time lapse (17 weeks) between UK theater showing dates and the UK DVD release date.

I believe Weinstein owns distribution rights in both UK and US, and would guess that the US release date could be 2/5/13 (always a Tuesday), unless they decide to stagger UK/US release dates. It would be nice if they'd publicize the new date so Amazon.com could post it.

(Update 2/5) For what it's worth, this English-subtitle version went on sale yesterday at Amazon UK. It is titled ""Untouchable"" there and is a PAL/Region 2 format DVD there. I have an all-region player, so I ordered it yesterday and have an expected delivery date of 2/12. The fact that the US release is delayed, and that Amazon.com hasn't even been given a release date to post, is really annoying. For a film that was huge when it hit French theaters in 2011, the reason for the repeated delay of the US DVD release by Weinstein Co. is hard to fathom.

(Edit 2/5) Looks like Amazon.com has now been given a release date of 3/5/13.

4952167,4,B0064JV4RY,"Inspired by the true events, ""The Intouchables"" follow the friendship between Philippe (Franois Cluzet), a quadriplegic millionaire, and Driss (Omar Sy), his new caregiver from a Paris slum. Despite (or because of) the differences in their social backgrounds and the fact that very outspoken Driss has no previous experience of caregiving, Philippe hires Driss, who helps Philippe sort out the deeper problems of his life.

But make no mistake about this. ""The Intouchables"" is a comedy, though its approach is understated. The theme may be serious, but the film itself is free from seriousness that would have weighed down the whole movie. ""The Intouchables"" will not spend time in saying what is obvious. There is no overdramatizing in the script. You will hear no preachy messages. Instead of them, you will follow the simple story of two credible characters the directors team Olivier Nakache and ric Toledano have successfully created: Philippe and Driss.

I for one thought the film would be more effective with shorter running time (the opening car chase sequence seems unnecessary). Also, I wanted to know more about some of the supporting characters, especially Philippe's secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot), with whom Driss flirts.

Still, ""The Intouchables"" is engaging and compelling throughout, thanks to the nuanced performances from the leads. The film became a huge box-office hit in France, the third most commercially successful film in that country's movie history (after ""Titanic"" and ""Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis"") and it is not a surprising thing at all.",1346630400,,1574,5.338709677419355

Fell right over and never said he was falling. LOL. I loved the story line. Driss learned quickly that he needed to become an extension of another person. It is so hard to adapt. I felt like a puppet at first. I could see in fleeting moments, Driss attempting to cope.

The scene when Phillipe was having respiratory problems was the first time Driss realized his nurturing abilities. That was the most tender moment in the whole movie.

It's hard to express the inherent love that is displayed on screen. The themes of forgiveness, empathy, pain, strength, and heartbreak are filmed and displayed beautifully - giving justice to the grayness of life.

The Intouchables felt like a lesson on caring, but not pitying. As Driss grew and became connected, an understanding developed between them. Driss continued to display a sharp tongue, wit, but was gentle and humble.

The sadness, growth, and love was mesmerizing. That this is all based on a true story is even crazier. I can say - without a shred of doubt - this is my favorite movie ever.

This story is about a parapalegic man who has had many tragedies in his life, but he is so financially well off you can barely tell. His life has been one way and he has been treated one way only. Then walks in this man, who is a grown man in age but not so much mentally, with no job and no real motivation to work, he would rather hang on the street corner with his boys.

Then BAM! their worlds collide in such a seamless fashion that you know it was meant to be. The camaraderie that happens in a matter of moments resonates throughout the whole film. Subtitles shmubtitles, who cares what you don't like, go see this movie, and if you have a heart, even a little one, you will leave the theatre full and satisfied, I guarantee it.",1344988800,4,911,4.141242937853107

4952185,5,B0064JV4RY,"The Intouchables, a French film written and directed by the team of Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, is I am moved to say absolutely one of the best films I've seen this year.  It is certainly one of the most enjoyable.  It is not, strictly speaking, a comedy, but it is so rich in humor and in human comedy that I found myself constantly laughing.  While fictional, The Intouchables is closely based on the real-life story of two men so starkly different in background and circumstances that it is difficult to imagine their lives even intersecting, let alone becoming intricately intertwined, and yet they did.  How it all came about is the story.

The film begins with Driss (Omar Sy), a young African immigrant, driving a luxurious Maserati sports car at full tilt along the streets of Paris at night.  Riding with him is Phillipe (Franois Cluzet), an older Frenchman with a beard who seems to be taking his companion's breakneck driving with remarkable calm.  When the police inevitably start after them, Driss bets Phillipe a hundred euros he can shake them off, which Phillipe takes.  When he fails to shake them off, Driss then offers to double the wager that he can turn the police into an escort, to which Phillipe laughingly says he's crazy but accepts the wager anyway. Driss then cons the police into believing that he's speeding because he has to get Phillipe - who can't get out of the car when the police order him to because he's a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the neck down - to the emergency room of a hospital.  Phillipe, in spite of the wager, proceeds to support Driss's con by pretending to be having a stroke.  The police then hurriedly escort the pair to the nearest hospital, where Driss tells them he can handle things from there, and then the police leave.  After having a good laugh at their getting away with it, Phillipe asks ""What do we do now?"", to which Driss replies confidently ""Let me take care of it"" and they drive off.  The scene sets up the rest of the movie - most of which occurs in flashback - by showing at once how different the two men are and how in spite of their differences they have an intimately playful us-against-the-world relationship that quickly intrigues and engages.

Flashing back to when Driss and Phillipe first met, we find Phillipe, a wealthy man who really is paralyzed from the neck down, in his Paris mansion, interviewing candidates with the help of his assistant Magalie (Audrey Fleurot) for a position as live-in caregiver to help with the more basic physical tasks that Phillipe needs but can no longer do for himself.  Candidate after candidate gives all the reasons why they'd be good for the position but Phillipe is clearly dissatisfied with all of them, not surprising when we learn that he's already gone through quite a few caregivers since becoming quadriplegic.  Enter Driss, a brash young man who cuts in ahead of other candidates, not wanting to wait because he's only there to get a paper signed indicating he was interviewed for the job and rejected so that he can qualify for welfare support.  He does everything wrong, openly revealing that he knows nothing about the job or the kind of work it involves and is only there to get his paper signed, even as he flirts outrageously with Magalie.  But at the same time he talks directly to Phillipe and even makes jokes, the only candidate to do so.  Intrigued, Phillipe tricks Driss into coming back, telling him to leave the paper and they will have it ready for him the next day.  When Driss returns, thinking he's only there to pick up his paper, Magalie takes him on a tour of the mansion, showing him in particular the room the caregiver will be living in - an extremely luxurious room bigger than the whole apartment Driss's aunt and four cousins occupy in a seedy Paris suburb- only at the end revealing to him that he's been hired.  Unable to resist the lure of all that luxury - and having nowhere else to go since his aunt kicked him out the night before - Driss decides to take the job.

It is comical to watch as Driss settles into his job, showing open astonishment as he realizes the extent of Phillipe's limitations, loudly protesting at some of the duties he's expected to handle, like putting tight stockings on Phillipe's legs to help with their circulation just for openers.  But we quickly see why Phillipe chose him:  Driss is completely uninhibited and utterly without pretense, never holds back what he's thinking, and he interacts with Phillipe like he does with everyone else:  crude and irreverent and disrespectful of boundaries and proprieties, but always as a person.  And because Driss seems to be the only person who can make Phillipe laugh.  I found myself constantly laughing at the humorous moments, but mainly it was in delight at the human comedy unfolding on the screen.

There are so many delightful scenes in The Intouchables, a lot of which center around either Driss drawing Phillipe out of his comfort zone or Phillipe drawing Driss out of his.  The first time Phillipe wants to go out for a ride, instead of the van designed to accommodate him and his wheelchair, Driss insists on taking the Maserati Quattroporte he sees instead.  ""Why would you want to ride around in that,"" he asks incredulously, dismissing the van, ""when you have this?""  The van never gets used after that.  Later, once Driss has gotten Phillipe to come out of himself more, Phillipe decides to go para-sailing again (it was in fact a para-sailing accident that left him paralyzed). Driss thinks Phillipe is crazy, loudly protesting that there's no way Phillipe is going to get him to try it. And then the next thing we see is Driss para-sailing, screaming in total terror at first but soon laughing and shouting at how incredible the experience is.  And one of the best scenes is at Phillipe's birthday party where the guests listen to a live chamber music group that Phillipe has hired. After most of the guests have gone and the musicians are about to leave, Phillipe impulsively tells them to stay, wanting to expose Driss to a variety of classical music, to which Driss responds, reluctantly at first, but then finally seeming to see what Phillipe gets out of it. Driss then turns around and plugs in his MP3 player, taking the opportunity to show Phillipe the kind of music he likes - Earth, Wind & Fire in particular - and soon he has the party rocking with everyone joining him on the dance floor.

In addition to the humor though, there are a lot of serious moments. Both Driss and Phillipe have their troubles.  Driss's relationship with his aunt is rocky because of his irresponsibility and his troubles with the law, and he sees one of his younger cousins is being lured into the gang life.  Phillipe misses his wife, who died of cancer before his accident.  His adopted daughter is a spoiled brat, he has a poetic pen-pal relationship with a women he longs to meet but is afraid to reveal his physical situation to, and he suffers periodically from excruciating phantom pains that he can do nothing about but endure.

There is a lot more that I could mention about what happens in the film, but I think it best not to say anything further.  It's simply too much fun to see things unfold as the relationship between Driss and Phillipe develops, both in the humorous moments as well as the more serious ones, so I will leave those pleasures for others to discover.

The cast are all very natural and their performances first-class, but Franois Cluzet's Phillipe and Omar Sy's Driss are truly outstanding in their roles.  Cluzet - who bears a striking resemblance to Dustin Hoffman - in some ways has the more difficult task as he can only use his face to convey everything about Phillipe's character, a particular challenge given Omar Sy's infectious and animated physicality.  But Cluzet does more than hold his own, showing Phillipe's evolution as his expressions grow less contained and more open as his relationship with Driss draws him out of himself.  Sy's challenge is more subtle as he must convey Driss's gradual maturing as new worlds and ideas are opened to him, and as he finds himself becoming more responsible, both in his relationship with Phillipe and in his attitude towards his family.  Both actors succeed marvelously, making their characters and the complex relationship the two share completely believable.  I later learned from reading about The Intouchables that Omar Sy appeared in three films that Nakache and Toledano did prior to this one.  Judging by his performance in The Intouchables, it's easy to see why they keep casting him.

It would be easy - if one has not actually seen The Intouchables - to dismiss it as just another ""buddy"" or ""odd-couple"" movie.  That would be a big mistake, because you'd be denying yourself a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  When it was released in late 2011, The Intouchables quickly became the second-biggest grossing film in French movie history.  Internationally, it is the biggest grossing non-English film, beating the record formerly held by Miyazaki's Spirited Away, proof that the appeal of the film and of its truly memorable characters is indeed universal.

Highly, highly recommended for everyone.  It may well be the best film you'll see all year.  It will certainly be the one you'll most enjoy having seen.",1343520000,124,9346,4.762554246745196

Rarely, do I put a DVD on my list for purchase as soon as I've seen it in the theater.  This is on my list... I'm looking forward to seeing it again.

A genuine treat... And based on a true story.  Two very different people who saved each other!  Beautiful story, beautifully told.

Enjoy!

***** August 5 update: *****

 I saw the film again yesterday.  It was just as charming the second time around.

Enjoy!",1341619200,21,525,4.468085106382978
4952187,5,B0064JV4RY,"What a pleasure to review a film when I don't have to reach for good things to say. This heartwarming R-rated comedy is based on a book which tells the true story of two wildly different men who find a common ground and build an enduring friendship based on mutual respect. It was clear from the very beginning that the audience was invested in the story and I loved hearing gales of laughter throughout the theater from beginning to end. Audiences at the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival voted this the ""Most Liked"" selection.

In this award-winning film from France (English captions), a wealthy aristocrat is paralyzed from a para-gliding accident and has hired many health-care worker/nurses who find caring for a wealthy quadriplegic too intimidating. A chronically unemployed immigrant from Senegal goes for an interview simply to get his application signed so he can continue his public assistance. He tends to be a little rude and doesn't show much respect or pity for the patient, who finds his lack of pity refreshing. The rest, as they say, is history.

We enjoy:
  * Franois Cluzet (""Tell No One"") is the aristocrat. His new nurse/attendant is like a splash of cold water right smack in the face (which is the only part of his body with any sensation)!
  * Omar Sy (""Micmacs"") is the irrepressible nurse who starts out by stealing a Faberg egg, so he isn't exactly a saint. His incredulity at his first opera is infectious and we all laughed along with our two heroes. And you've gotta see this guy dance!
  * Anne Le Ny (""Declaration of War"") is charming as the woman who runs the house, the staff, and knows everything. Her slow but steady thaw is so gratifying.
  * Audrey Fleurot (""Midnight in Paris"") has two of the funniest scenes with the nurse, and you don't expect it either time.

As a wrap-up, they include a couple of clips of the real fellows who were depicted in this film. That is very nice. Once again I have proven I am not an artiste. This satisfying little film has no aspirations to Art (capital ""A""), but instead to Entertainment, which is where my discretionary spending money goes. Yes, I will BUY this one from Amazon.",1341446400,75,2162,4.693121693121693

4952209,4,B0064JV4RY,"""The Intouchables"" (2011 movie from France; 112 min.) brings the real life story (more on that later) of Philippe, a wealthy tetraplegic, and Driss, a young and poor man from the ghettos, who is hired as his live-in carer. Driss seems to not care about much but himself, although he is also dealing with family issues in parts of the movie. But Driss and Philippe strike a bond, and become closer as the movie develops. I don't want to give more away from the plot as you'll just have to see how it all plays out, but I will say there are some surprises.

That said, this is a great movie, and as such the ""feel good"" movie of the year so far. It was a packed house when I saw it this weekend at my local indie theatre here in Cincinnati, and the crowd just loved it, laughing at many occasions. But the movie really didn't hit home for me until the credits rolled and, low and behold, it brought some actual footage from the real Philippe and Driss in one of the scenes recreated in the movie. (As an aside, the real Philippe and Driss are nowhere near as nice looking as in the movie, but that's of course why movies are movies). Moreover, we are then also told what happened to these guys in real life since then.

Franois Cluzet (as Philippe) and Omar Sy (as Driss) provide superb performances, and in fact Sy won the French equivalent of the Oscar for Best Actor, and rightfully so. In all, this is a great movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1341100800,15,1438,4.342007434944238

4952215,5,B0064JV4RY,"I didn't know a lot about this film heading into a sneak preview in Dallas last week, but left agog at this thrilling, fantastic piece of movie-making from co-directors  Olivier Nakache and &Eacute;ric Toledano.  It's the best film experience - no, the best theater-going experience - I've had in well some time.  I saw it with a keyed-up audience of Francophiles who had clearly heard the buzz and wanted to be there to see what has been called a 'cultural phenomenon' in Europe as it first hits US shores.

Believe the hype.  Nakache and Toledano have constructed their film as a M&ouml;bius Strip - starting near to the end in seat-gripping introduction as co-protagonists Driss (Omar Sy in a groundbreaking C&eacute;sar-winning performance) and Philippe (Franois Cluzet -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tell-No-One/dp/B0031ZNGMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tell No One</a>) race a Maserati Quattroporte through the streets of late-night Paris.  Earth, Wind and Fire's ""September"" never sounded so good.  The directors then take us back to the start to show us how the two met.

The film perfectly mixes comedy and poignancy.  Sy - a gifted physical and verbal comedian - had our audience convulsed, at times, with laughter.  The subject matter - dealing with quadriplegia - doesn't seem ripe for comedy, but the film conveys both Philippe's desire not to be pitied and Driss' guileless honesty.  He simply treats Philippe as he would anyone else.  He's never been trained to do anything different.

I extend this entreaty to all mainstream movie-goers: lay down your prejudices and aversions to subtitled movies and see this film.  Don't miss out.  I'm sure Hollywood will re-make this film...and kill it.  Please see this original version.  No one will pull your man card.  You will not be disappointed.",1336780800,226,1851,5.4125874125874125

4952217,5,B0064JV4RY,"Philippe is handsome and rich, with a palatial apartment (complete with team of domestics) in the heart of Paris.  Philippe's only ""hassle,"" as Driss puts it:  He is paralyzed from the neck down.  A young black man fresh from prison, Driss is eager for a signature from Philippe attesting that he interviewed for a caregiver position but too bad, so sad was not qualified.  This signature is all Driss needs to qualify for France's cushy unemployment benefits.  Unfortunately for Driss, Philippe decides to hire him instead.

Why Philippe would place his life in the hands of the brash, rather unsympathetic Driss is a mystery at first.  Yet as the movie unfolds, you experience firsthand the tension between how Philippe sees himself (useless, embarrassing, ashamed), how past caregivers have treated him (as a fragile doll they are terrified of breaking), and how Driss sees him:  Driss is the only one to accept Philippe as a real human being with a future, with dreams and possibilities of his own.

A beautiful film, based on a true story.  Wish they made more like these in America!  The opera scene was absolutely hilarious.",1334620800,20,1131,4.931216931216931
