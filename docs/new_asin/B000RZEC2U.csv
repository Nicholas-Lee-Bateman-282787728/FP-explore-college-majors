8203174,5,B000RZEC2U,"This film is more the story of an epic journey toward the light than it is a typical documentary.  You are not getting two hours of glamorous photography.  It is dark and atmospheric, and if you let yourself, you can get absolutely lost in the metaphysical undertones.  A major theme in the film is electricity and how it is at odds with nature; accordingly, I find myself wanting to rewatch this when I am stressed out with 'modern problems.'  The filmmaker's monotone voice is at first strange but then oddly soothing.  You can say that about the whole film, actually.  As the crew travels further north into Canada's cold and darkness in search of the light, the isolation feels like a relief in spite of the physical challenges.  The reward really is saved for the end of the journey: it is only then that we have earned the beautiful pictures of light.  One of my favorite films ever.  Watch when your mind is calm and open to deep contemplation.",1470355200,,951,4.579881656804734

8203177,4,B000RZEC2U,I like this dvd... it is a documentary of a crew who were out to photograph the northern lights well.,1398988800,,101,4.1
8203178,1,B000RZEC2U,I'd say less than 5 minutes of northern lights footage. Few details of the cause of the lights provided. Movie seemed low budget with no purpose.,1358294400,,145,4.615384615384615
8203179,4,B000RZEC2U,"The documentary was well done overall. The first few minutes would have been better placed elsewhere in the film - the train ride north voiceover would have been great. That is what caught me, and held my attention throughout the movie to the close.",1323648000,2,249,4.681818181818182
