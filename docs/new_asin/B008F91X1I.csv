5157598,5,B008F91X1I,Great collection of Beverly Hills Chihuahua movies kids loved them,1455235200,,66,5.7
5157599,4,B008F91X1I,"I know how much cinephiles loathe these motion pictures and others of its genre, but, dudes and gals, loosen up! It is great to have all three together! Along the way commenting on the three films, I'll mention the separate DVD editions of each one, for reference's sake. Sure, ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua: [1]"", the first movie in Disney's Chihuahua Trilogy, is more than a little ""sappy"", but take some time out to be ""sappy and happy"" viewing this movie (available as viewed on DVD, among other DVD and Blu-Ray editions, as Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment 057850/02)! The adventures of these chihuahuas, other dogs, and assorted animals is a delight, especially for those who have a ""tender spot"" for the hounds! This movie never was meant to appeal to the viewer's sophistication. On the other hand, it is not any sort of ""chihuahua exploitation film"", either.

My favourite hounds in this California-Mexico romp are Pap, Chlo's ardent male admirer and very determinedly valiant chihuahua, and Delgado, the down-on-his-luck, butch German shepherd who rescues, and does various acts of kindness for, Chlo, even when he misinterprets the reasons for Chlo's second disappearance. Then, too, who cannot love the thronging hoard of chihauhuas among the ruins of an ancient indigenous culture? Seeing Chlo try to find the mighty voice of her ""inner chihuahua"" (as opposed to pampered pet squeaks and whimpering) with the aid of the leader of this pack of chihuahuas is very amusing; I wish that this bit of animal humour had been more extended!

This is a pack of fun, and not just for children! Have a barking good time watching this film, in the theatre or at home on the DVD or Blu-Ray player!

The Chihuahua cinema concession continues, without letdown in inspired fun, with parts two and three, the sequels of the Chihuahua trilogy, i.e. ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua: 2, the Family Just Got Bigger"" (Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment 105886) and ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua: 3, Viva la Fiesta, Family Always Matters"" (Disney 109086/02). Each leading canine cast favourite hound will bound around on your screen for more Chihuahua mania!

The second film of the series is the only one that seems even slightly routine, mostly concerned with the swank dog show that Chlo and Papi, plus one of their canine buddies, come to dominate, but, alas, not to win. The two Chihuahuas and their pups also, with Delgado's expert help, catch some bank robbers.

My favourite of the two sequels, however, is the ""Beverly Hill Chihuahua: 3"", which is wonderfully zany and replete with one madcap antic after another. In that one, Papi and Chlo (and the others) celebrate daughter Rosita's ""quinceaera"" (its timing reckoned in equivalent ""dog years""), while some skullduggery has been taking place at a fancy Beverly Hills pet hotel, where a treacherous female employee and a suspicious administrative hound, on behalf of the leading rival such establishment, the two of them colluding with an outside secret agent, are undertaking some disloyal commercial spying and sabotage, which Delgado, Papi, and others uncover and thwart, saving their human master's and mistress' jobs there while they are at it. The canine Mariachi band for Rosita's party and during the rehearsals for it is especially droll and endearing.

Don't miss these movies! You and the children or teenagers of your household also might enjoy the attractively written, printed, and illustrated ""junior novels"" published so far (as of mid-2014) which are based on the first two films of the trilogy!",1406851200,,3555,5.099656357388316
