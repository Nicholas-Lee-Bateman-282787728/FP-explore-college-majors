8242306,5,B0011U5260,"Still We Ride documents the plight of bicyclists who endure repression, insults and personal and violent attacks from not only automobiles but from police, whose job it is to stifle free thought and individuality with the coercion of ""authority"".

The nature of riding a bicycle is an individual act that brings about rage and animosity from the conformity of cars and their driving culture which pollutes the environment, kills humans and causes war over resources.

Bicyclists assert their rights in monthly rides called Critical Mass. It has been the attempt of the ""authorities"" to criminalize and eradicate rides due to their collective nature. But as long as Bicyclists are defiant, they will always ride.",1388620800,,711,5.228070175438597
8242307,5,B0011U5260,"This video shows the plight of citizens who want to use the roads peacefully, but find themselves literally brutalized by cowardly bullies who somehow became cops. We all know the bully's problem: He only feels good about himself when he's picking on people whom he thinks are weaker. Society is the enemy of such thugs. Society suffers when the shameless bully's low self-esteem and guilt compel him to do things to innocent bicyclists that ought to put him in prison, but usually because he has a badge results in only a slap on the wrist from fellow (criminal) cops. Not all cops are bad, but events such as Critical Mass attract the worst cops, who are truly society's weakest links.",1305417600,,687,4.733333333333333
8242308,1,B0011U5260,"This is a documentary about a bunch of jerks who get together every month, ride their bikes en masse through the streets, paying no heed to the rules of the road, then complain when the cops justifiably arrest them for breaking the law.  If you don't like the law then VOTE TO CHANGE IT, you crybabies.",1269388800,,302,4.392857142857143
