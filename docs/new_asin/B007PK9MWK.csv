8520404,4,B007PK9MWK,Classic and morally uplifting story with a metaphysical bent.  Today's movies should have more messages such as these.,1485216000,,118,5.555555555555555
8520405,2,B007PK9MWK,"Rudolph Valentino is only in the movie for maybe 5 minutes, if that. Otherwise, the movie is kinda cute.",1481328000,,104,4.526315789473684
8520406,5,B007PK9MWK,"An interesting story and concept. A very young Rudolph Valentino adds to the drama as a blackmailer to Clara Kimball Young to make her look the guilty party so that her husband may divorce her. I found the entire film totally engrossing as the star, Ms. Young, is given a crystal ball  to see three versions of her future. Interesting is the fact that Gloria Swanson would make this same film in 1927 as ""The Loves of Sunya"". Both versions are exceptional!",1410134400,3,456,4.560975609756097
8520407,4,B007PK9MWK,If only because of the appearance of Rudolph Valentino. I would have given it 5 stars if he had been in the movie longer. He had such strong screen presence.,1364947200,2,157,4.266666666666667
8520408,5,B007PK9MWK,"Even though this isn't one of the better-known films of the Teens, I was really impressed by it, having previously only seen the excerpt featuring Rudolph Valentino's memorable cameo as the cabaret parasite Clarence Morgan.  The print could use some remastering work, but it's in pretty good condition otherwise, and though the backing score also might be updated, it's still more varied and interesting than many other scores to unremastered silents, which oftentimes just have a dull repetitive organ or piano in the background.

The movie opens to three holy wise men of India, sitting on a mountain as intertitles philosophise about the state of the world and how it's a shame so few people are in tune with matters of the spirit and with being kind to others and true to themselves.  One of these wise men chances to see Gina Ashling, the main character, rescuing a puppy with no tail from two mean boys who were planning to tie it up and abuse or kill it, and knows right away she has a kind heart and isn't like most other people.  Shortly after this Gina's boyfriend Peter, who has gotten a letter asking him to sail to Europe to advance his career, proposes to her, and she accepts, but as we soon find out, there is trouble in paradise.  Gina's father, a widower, finds himself in serious trouble in his own career, partly because he has been refusing to listen to the modern ideas of his son Kenneth, ideas about how to run the bank in a more satisfactory, efficient, productive, and financially successful manner.  Gina also has the opportunity to go to Europe with a Mr. de Salvo to pursue her aspirations of being an opera singer.  Meanwhile her father, Kenneth, and her sister Rita want her to stay at home and help them out financially, and to marry the rich Mr. Goring.

At night, one of the wise men comes by the house and asks for bread; everyone runs away from him in fear or feels suspicion towards this foreign stranger, all except for Gina, who helps him when he has a bit of a fainting spell on the veranda.  The two of them retire to one of the rooms of the house, and the meat of the story begins.  The mysterious stranger puts a crystal ball on the table and tells her she has three chances to gaze into it, looking into her own soul, to see herself about five years in the future, according to each of the three paths she decides to foresee.  The three paths she decides to look into are Duty (staying at home to help out her family), Ambition (going to Europe with Mr. de Salvo to become an opera singer), and Wealth (marrying Mr. Goring, whom she doesn't love, to get access to his wealth, which will help her family considerably).  None of these paths end happily, and when she has seen them all, Gina must decide what to do, and to convince her father that the path she does decide to take will bring everyone involved the most happiness, and that if he only saw things through the eyes of youth (hence the title), maybe he would realise why she was making this decision.

The star of the film, Clara Kimball Young, was one of the most popular moviestars, male or female, of the Teens, and this movie makes it clear why.  She goes through a whole range of emotions and experiences, as well as, during certain of the future visions, having to have a drastically different physical appearance.  It's a shame most of her films are lost, with most of her lost films being from her height of popularity, but at least some of them, like this one (considered by many to be her best), are still around, and people can get even a limited glimpse of what made her so great and popular.  It's also a wonderful look into the world of the past, seeing how different society was, what was expected of women and what happened to those women who dared to challenge the unquestioned power and hypocrisy of men (such as in the vision of the Path of Wealth) and to defend their actions.  Some people might find the moralizing and philosophy preachy or heavy-handed, but I thought that angle was worked very well and naturally into the storyline, and found it overall quite moving as well as entertaining and a fascinating slice of life from the late Teens.",1126137600,7,4169,4.500662251655629
