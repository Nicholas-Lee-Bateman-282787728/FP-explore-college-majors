7156612,4,B00X3DC79I,"I was pleasantly surprised by this Slasher flick! It has a well peiced together storyline and doesn't at all seem like some of these thrown together messes we have seen alot of lately. Even though it has some camp appeal. There are some genuinely disturbing and creepy scenes.

The story starts out as a flashback and builds wonderfully from there. Of course these are critics that will say ""the characters made stupid decisions""  .But if they didn't,the film wouldn't be as fun!

The acting was good and we get large doses of Horror icons (Bill Moseley) and (Kane Hodder) who play psychotic brothers with some distasteful habits. This isn't the first time we've seen an ambulance used for purposes of carnage in a slasher film,in 2008 we saw it in the After Dark Horror Fest film Autopsy.

This film isn't without some twists and turns along the way and the ride is fun! There are some well done practical gore effects and some splatter,I believe I saw one CGI kill but that's all. I would give it a 6/7 on the 1 to10 gore meter. I was never bored, not even in the beginning when they took quite awhile to introduce and develop the characters.

I think most slasher fans will find it quite entertaining and satisfying.",1443484800,10,1219,4.599078341013825

7156615,5,B00X3DC79I,"I saw this film last night at a private screening in Randloph, MA.  I love indie horror films, and it was so cool to be able to meet the creator of a move.  He was really cool and down to earth.  The movie was awesome, great plot twists, and visuals.  Scary from the moment it starts to the end when it finishes.  The  story line is great and I think it is so awesome that it is based of the creators own nightmare.  This also the first time that I've been to a movie where there was a Q&A session with the creator.  It was awesome to hear about his creative process, and how the actors contributed.

7156660,3,B00X3DC79I,"Not a bad movie, not a great one.  Like the title itself, Old 37, some points were brought up in the movie but not really addressed.  You did see once that the ambulance used was 37...okay, great....there was no history or significance to the unit number as to why that would be the title but...whatever.  The 'paramedics"" had a typical reason to be the ghouls they were and, like some have said, much of the ""victim"" cast was unlikable except for the male and female lead (IMO).  Thing is....the same male and female lead were targeted because of a certain ""crime"" against the killers and it was never addressed that they were wrong so that plotline went..nowhere...plus they're killing everyone anyone so, why did they need a reason much less one that wasn't even fleshed out.  That said, I don't regret the time watching it.  If you like your plot smooth and filled like a new highway then you might not like this one, but if you like your horror predatory, old-school and you're willing to just sit back and let a B horror movie be a good time, then you might as well sit back in Old 37.  And least you won't get a big bill in the mail later.",1478995200,2,1146,4.402843601895735

7156680,4,B00X3DC79I,"I would have given this 5 stars if the supporting cast was better and more emphasis was put on the killing, but this is a great movie. Kane Hodder does his thing and kills the hell out of some unsuspecting victims. Bill Moseley is his classic self and is the main reason I watched this, but i wish he had a more prominent role. The ambulance is a great cover for killing victims on the side of the road, or on it. cool movie",1467417600,3,424,4.059523809523809
7156681,3,B00X3DC79I,"Great throwback horror movie!  Two children grew up watching their father work as a paramedic...but as a twisted paramedic.  He would rush to the scene of an accident and instead of helping the victim(s) he inflicted more pain and eventually caused their deaths. As he did this over and over the children eventually grew as twisted and as sick as he was carrying on in his footsteps wrecking havoc on people near death.

This movie while not perfect really is a throwback to the old days when families like the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" were around and everyone was sick and murderous. Starring in this movie is Kane""the best Jason ever"" Hodder and Bill ""Leatherface"" Mosely from two of the best franchises in horror ever. They carry the movie as the two demented paramedics who have taken on in their fathers footsteps.

Some good action, plenty of good kills and gore this throwback is def worth watching.  Reminds me of those movies on Chiller, you know whats going to happen but they are too good to look away.",1467417600,,1014,4.706214689265536

Gee that guy is a terrible ;-)  In all seriousness, this was a trainwreck from start to finish, but I guess I stuck it out because I am a sucker for anything Bill Moseley is involved in. And he did a great job with the role he was given, though he didn't exactly break any new ground with it. I was surprised how little he and Kane Hodder were used until about the last 20 minutes of the movie. Most of this piece of crap focused on a bunch of awful idiotic teenagers.  Still, I give Bill Moseley a 4 star review, but the rest of the movie, which had a terrible plot full of holes, was filmed poorly, and badly acted by most of the teenage cast, a 1 star review.

The story was somewhat different and it is about 2 brothers that listen to 911 calls and then go and get the accident victims in their ambulance and then torture and kill them.

The films barley follows them though & instead somewhat focuses on some stereotypical teen who are very easy to hate. Some so much that you want bad things to happen to them. Basic story is 2 brothers had a father that used to kill people by pretending to be a paramedic, they grow up & do the same. But there is a purpose to them killing the young people in question (which I won't spoil) so its not all just random mayhem. Some kills are ok, others aren't. A bit slow to get things started & drags a bit in the middle.

7156791,1,B00X3DC79I,"Same old rehashed bulls***. Had potential with Kane Hodder and Bill Moseley. Was pretty much an MTV teen ""horror"" movie.",1444780800,,120,5.05
7156792,1,B00X3DC79I,"Terrible terrible terrible movie. Nothing like the trailer. This is more of a teenage drama than anything else. Tons of wasted scenes dealing with adolescent youths problems. The villains in this movie are not menacing at all, they don't feel threatening or invincible like your typical horror slasher characters.  The movie uses flashbacks at the worst time, they completely intrude on the uninteresting story. The acting is awful, I understand it's independent, but it's really bad. No real good scares and barely any gore or shock scares. Do not be fooled by the trailer.",1444780800,,574,5.1063829787234045
7156813,1,B00X3DC79I,"Old 37 sounds like a great piece of horror but its just one of the worst movies since Kane Hodder's other film Muck. The story is suppose to be about 2 paramedics who intercept calls & kills whoever called. However, we get a quick back story of the brothers, a few kills, & then it switches to teenage soap opera while the paramedics are absent for a good half hour or more. The film clocks in at 80 minutes & feels like it's over 2 hours. There is very little to no gore on display & Moseley & Hodder are wasted in what is almost like mere cameos to a horrible story. I like Hodder but his recent movies have sucked.",1444694400,,617,4.107438016528926

7156815,3,B00X3DC79I,"Unfortunately, Hodder and Moseley's roles in the movie become a subplot to the 'MTV-ish' teen love story drama that seems to take up most of the screen time. The DVD's cover would more accurately portray the film if it had all the teen actors in the foreground and the ambulance with the killers behind them. Please feature more Hodder and Moseley in the sequel!",1444694400,10,362,4.671875
7156816,5,B00X3DC79I,"Dvd came on time, slick and clean..

Now, about the movie, Bill Moseley and Kane Hodder are the main reasons why I bought this movie, because they're amazing horror icons. Bill Moseley kicks so much ass as a psycho. The story is good, but the kills are twice as better. There's no holes and everything is explained from beginning to end.",1444608000,5,337,4.524590163934426
7156817,1,B00X3DC79I,"The preview makes this movie look like it has immense potential. I went in expecting a dark, intense movie that dug deep in to the plot line of the two ""paramedic"" brothers, however the main focus of the movie was on the outcast teenage girl. This movie had a lot of potential but the acting was horrendous.  It could have been decent if they focused on the ""paramedic"" brothers but they were more of an afterthought. The story line ended up being more like a teenage drama. Do not waste your time with this one!",1444608000,2,512,4.389473684210526

7156819,2,B00X3DC79I,"Not sure what others are seeing to rate this 5 out of 5. It too often seems like a teen soap you'd see on The CW rather than the gritty, violent horror film it is advertised as. I have to imagine that is why the director removed his name from it and instead is credited as ""Alan Smithee."" The teen drama stuff takes up way too much of the already brief running time, leaving precious little screentime for Kane Hodder and Bill Mosely to do their thing as sickos taking out their revenge on careless teens.",1444003200,,505,4.270833333333333

I saw this in Chicago at the Music Box Theater and was blown away.  There are so many good things about this film:  great writing, great acting, great music I can't do justice to it.  Casting Kane Hodder and Bill Moseley (modern day equivalents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi) was absolutely brilliant and they exceed their expectations.  But don't take my work - go see it for yourself, you won't be disappointed if you like to explore your dark side that is......",1443484800,,643,4.361344537815126

All the characters were creeps so who cares when they die. The end made no sense. The main character had a mom who looked two yrs older than her. Completely unbelievable.
