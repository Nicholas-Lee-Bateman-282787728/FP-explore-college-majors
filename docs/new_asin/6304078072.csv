8358106,5,6304078072,"This is an excellent video for children and adults.  We have been checking this video tape out from our local public library so many times!  My daughter is absoluetly in love with this video, so I am going to finally  buy one for her!  I can just put this video in the VCR and she's there in  front of the TV immediately!  She loves to watch the cartoons and even  sings along with the nursery rhyme songs that she knows.
As an adult, I  like this cartoon video for many reasons.  There is actually a story to the  video... A troupe of children, cats, mice, and other animals are putting on  a play for an audience.  The stage crew is also seen opening and closing  the curtains from behind the curtain, which helps children understand that  there is more than just what they see from their seat in an audience.  The  nursery rhymes are presented in a creative and seamless manner, which helps  children and their parents understand the rhymes a little better... as if  we were getting some extra explanations from an author.  Ex. Old Mother  Hubbard's dog runs away and becomes someone else's dog so the cartoon has  ""Old Mother Hubbard"" followed by ""Where Has My Little Dog  Gone"" followed by another song about a man who finds a dog and feeds  him well.  I really like Phylicia Rashad's singing of the nursery rhymes.  She sings in a jazzy/scat manner.  You can also pick up on intonations in  her voice that scream ""Mrs. Huxtable"" from ""The Cosby  Show.""
Also, even though some nursery rhymes can be scary in  nature, the cartoon presents them in a not-so-scary manner.  Ex.  ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" shows a mother under the tree, who catches her  baby after he/she falls from his/her cradle in the tree.",947116800,6,1702,4.5514950166112955
