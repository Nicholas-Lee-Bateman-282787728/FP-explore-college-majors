2453882,5,B000C8STPI,"I thoroughly enjoy this video. Having not seen the original release, I was pleased to have the included Einstein videos. As for ""The Elegant Universe"", it turns extremely complicated mathematical foundations of past, present and current advancing theoretical physics into visually inspiring explanations that a person who is not an everyday Stephen Hawking can comprehend. However, a person who is not somewhat familiar with these concepts may be completely blown away and may have a hard time believing let alone understanding them. I have read many books relating to the material so it painted a much clearer picture of what I already know. With that said, I recommend this DVD to anyone who has ever questioned the laws governing the existence of everyday natural phenomena as well as the existence of the universe itself, or just curious about physics in general.

2453883,3,B000C8STPI,"As a warning to other potential purchasers, please note that this is not a new program ""Beyond"" the original ""The Elegant Universe"" but just a repackaging with 2 other programs.

I thought the first DVD was great, and was just about to purchase this one because it sounded like a new program continuing where the first left off, but in fact it is EXACTLY the same program! I got the details from WGBH.org and here they are :-

THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE AND BEYOND is a compliation of three different NOVA programs that have already aired. They are listed below with synopses on each one:

1) The Elegant Universe (WG36779)

Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory Join host Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and the best-selling author of The Elegant Universe, for an in-depth exploration of the groundbreaking new string theory that will excite scientists and non-scientists alike. If string theory proves correct, the universe we see obscures a reality that is far richer and more complex than anyone ever imagined--a universe with numerous hidden dimensions, a universe in which the fabric of space can rip and tear, a universe that may be but one of many parallel universes

2) Einstein's Big Idea (WG38889)

Everyone's heard of it, but what does E=mc2 really mean? With brilliant period recreations, discover how an obscure patent clerk, Albert Einstein, came up with his shattering 1905 discovery that the realms of matter and energy are inescapably linked. Starring Aidan McArdle (Ella

Enchanted) as Einstein, and Shirley Henderson (Bridget Jones's Diary) as Einstein's first wife, Mileva Maric.

3) Einstein Revealed (WG26479)

Journey into the mind of a genius in this penetrating profile of the world's most renowned physicist, who contributed more than any other to our modern vision of physical reality. Andrew Sachs (Fawlty Towers) stars as Albert Einstein.

I Hope this helps prevent anyone wasting their money buying the same program twice.",1140998400,400,2022,5.174846625766871
2453884,5,B000C8STPI,"Well, this guy sure is cute for a nerd. Clearly i've got the wrong professors. The show was produced very well and the goofy tone and visuals helped set things plain enough for me. Good show, nice butt.",1244160000,4,202,4.342105263157895
2453885,5,B000C8STPI,"I always been interested in physics, perhaps it can be very fuzzy sometimes. Brian Green is an awsome physist and he presents the subject in a simple way that we all can understand. This is a great documentary also with the background we need about Eistein, Well Recommended if you like or not physics, you'll after this!!!",1224028800,,323,4.684210526315789
2453886,4,B000C8STPI,"Este es un video que te muestra algo mas alla de la teoria del big bang las explicaciones son tan simples que resulta increible que pueda ser algo tan complejo, definitivamente lo recomiendo, solo hay un pero y es que no tiene subtitulos en espaol solo tiene closed caption pero no te arrepentiras !!!",1198368000,,301,4.592592592592593
2453887,5,B000C8STPI,"Some complain that this set is not what claims to be, I beg to differ. It is indeed ""The Elegant Universe and Beyond""... Perhaps some thought it was ""Beyond the Elegant universe"" or even ""The Elegant Universe II"", well it is not.

This a great box set for those who do not already own any of the three titles it contains. Each of these titles I might add is worth the price of the box set alone in my opinion.

If you didn't already know, this set contains three nova episodes:

1) The Elegant Universe (WG36779)

2) Einstein's Big Idea (WG38889)

3) Einstein Revealed (WG26479)

Each of these episodes are great on their own but watching them together really puts you in the life of Einstein and makes you think about physics and math as you may never have done so before. The style of the Einstein episodes is great for getting younger students interested in science and exploration.

I say get this box set and you will be entertained as well as educated at the same time. Watch them with your kids.",1179446400,10,1002,4.442622950819672

2453889,5,B000C8STPI,"I think I have watched the ""Elegant Universe"" part at least ten times, and I learn something new each time.  I found the biographies of Einstein very well done as well, (only watched them twice).  Even though I am a physician, I have always had an interest in nearly all the ""arts and sciences"" ever since I can remember, and I am also a big science fiction fan as well.  (Got my start at age 10 when I saw the movie, ""2001: a Space Odyssey"".)  I find this DVD set to be so well done that I have bought extra copies as gifts for other people.  It explains fascinating new concepts of how our universe is put together in a very ""user-friendly"" and creative/artistic way, and does it so well that you might just consider taking on a new hobby/career/college degree!!!  A very provocative and inspiring production!  The negative reviews that I read here sound like they come from people who are conceited know-it-alls who like to shove that fact into people's faces, and are NOT giving an accurate and fair representation of this collection of DVDs.  If you have a natural interest in understanding how the Universe works around you and want to know how scientists are trying to add to that knowledge, you will NOT be disappointed by this set!!",1172880000,10,1241,4.558558558558558

2453891,1,B000C8STPI,"Like an aging rock band in need of money, PBS took The Elegant Universe and added two second rate documentaries to make it ""Beyond.""  The two added disc aren't the worst documentaries I've ever seen, but they are about Einstein and add nothing new to String Theory.  I was expecting a continuation of The Elegant Universe, maybe even Leonard Susskind showing the mathematical formulas behind the theory, but I am very disappointed.",1168905600,11,431,4.972222222222222
2453892,5,B000C8STPI,If you are thinking about the Elegant Universe which is extraordinary . . . stretch to buy this package as the EV is one of the three DVDs.  The other two are about Einstein and quantum history as we grew these theories over time as a human race.  I watch mine over and over.  You will never stop learning.  The quantum world is the doorway to our future.  This set is exquisite !  Great for all audiences !,1167782400,10,407,4.153846153846154
2453893,4,B000C8STPI,"I enjoyed this DVD set very much.  I contains the Elegant Universe and 2 other DVDs which basically chronicle the history of string theory and the life of Albert Einstein.  I am a lay person so I do know how much it would appeal to a physicist or other scientist, but for a novice like me I found it very informative.",1167782400,8,317,4.180327868852459

8096304,4,B000C8STPI,"This is a real good buy and is great watching. The Einstein discs are a good segway into the ""Elegant Universe"" itself. It can be a little dated considering all the recent advances and the soon to be expected advances in the physics and cosmology worlds, but great anyways!",1281916800,,273,4.591836734693878
8096305,5,B000C8STPI,"The Elegant Universe DVD wasn't trying to be a carbon copy of the book. Its graphics make everyday people understand complex
theories, because if you are a physicist or had read lots of String Theory literature or Quantum Physics books and purchase this DVD you are going to be bored because the main idea of the DVD is to educate and reach people that are not that interested in physics or don't have the background to understand the complexities in the book. It is great because simple examples engage and explain its theories and if you want to go deeper you can purchase the book. I noticed that some people were criticizing the repeating parts in the DVD. They may not realize that the DVD was a 3 part presentation on PBS so repetition was required in order to get people who skipped a section on TV up to speed.
I really enjoy the DVD set and now I want to read the book.",1254096000,2,878,4.359756097560975
