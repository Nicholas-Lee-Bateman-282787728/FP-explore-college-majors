8267320,3,B0017UAZCA,This was not a very good War Concert DVD. The one thing that I did like was that the original harmonica player was in the group. Otherwise the vocals weren't that great.,1381190400,,169,4.3125
8267321,2,B0017UAZCA,"The sound on this dvd is terrible ! I heard better sound comming from my old fisher- price record player form back in the day . If a little money was spent improving the sound it would be a great dvd, because it captures war at there peak. Who ever released this dvd with this low sound quality needs there head examined !",1249257600,,322,4.126984126984127
8267322,3,B0017UAZCA,"I'm a big WAR fan since the mid 70's...their Live 2 disk set is great! I was hoping for more of the same...it's not a bad concert since this was in the 80's.  My gripe I also ordered WAR Live in Halifax 80's.  One does not list the songs, so it seems like 2 different show, but they it is the SAME Concert!!!  I feel ripped off.....",1206748800,,332,3.925373134328358
8267323,5,B0017UAZCA,"What can I say ?

This is a great concert and the band puts it down period.

If you like this band and realize that 5.1 surround sound was not around or hi def you will appreciate this concert for what it is a great band playing great songs. The musicianship is top knotch sure the picture and
sound are not up to today's technology but this band puts it down
I thoroughly enjoYed this concert and accept the fact it was recorded
in 1980. if you are A true fan of the band do not buy into the bs reviews and get this dvd these guys know how to jam the grooves regardless.
I'm looking for another recorded show of them live on dvd with original lineup but Oh yeah it don't exist so rock out and enjoy the music because
this band knows how to play regardless of the technology in 1980 for live
perfomance.

Great show from a great band :):):)",1203120000,,840,4.109756097560975
8267324,2,B0017UAZCA,The sound and visual aspects of this dvd are terrible. It reminds me of a cheap bootleg put on dvd. Buy this video only if you are a real die hard War fan otherwise just listen to their music or wait til they come to a town near you and see them live.,1198800000,,251,3.7547169811320753
8267325,2,B0017UAZCA,"First live DVD I have seen of War. I was excited when I picked it up but skeptical at the same time. Picture quality is low, soft image but pro shot. Audio is mono with no treble. This DVD looks like it was recorded from a boot tape to DVD. Save your money unless you are that deep into War.",1188086400,,291,3.8666666666666667
8267326,3,B0017UAZCA,"This dvd has me scratching my head wondering why nobody spent the extra money to make what is a good dvd into a great one... especially since there are no other current War dvd's available... Why Jerry Goldstein why.. So what's the problem?...the audio on this dvd is comparable to a good quality concert bootleg tape... It is not even in stereo let alone have Dolby noise reduction... It sounds very muddy at times other times better...all instruments tend to bleed together or say when the sax is playing fade to the background,in other words a loud instrument drowns out the rest,the guitar is rarely heard... The video is ok not great... we could live with it if the audio made up for it.  Another odd thing is apparently whoever put this together did not know War very well.. Song number 2 is called All My Sorrows  but is really Slippin' Into Darkness(all my sorrows is a line out of it) and Gypsy Man is spelled Gipsy Man...speaking of Gypsy Man it features great Lee Oskar harmonica playing that was amazing to me...The band plays loose and good here and on the whole concert..  Bottom line if you love War like me you will want and should buy this as the guys greatness still shines thru here... just run your audio output into your TV for this one not your stereo and you'll be alot happier..",1180137600,,1302,4.508474576271187
