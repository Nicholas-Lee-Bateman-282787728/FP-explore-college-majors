2730685,5,B000MGB3EE,"Not everyone likes Verdi, but he's not the great maestro of opera without reason.  Verdi means melody.  Verdi means knowing how to grip us with recognizable emotion.  This production of ""Stiffelio"" is a case in point.  The Met has given us a sumptuous feast for eye and ear.  While the story may seem a bit disjointed, even far-fetched, (its first audience was puzzled by it and let it disappear from public gaze) there is a feast here for those who love opera.  The cast is well chosen.  I particularly enjoyed Sharon Sweet.  I was not familiar with her and found her singing expressive and pleasing to the ear.  Placido Domingo delivers with his usual panache, and Levine convinces you this is an opera oppurtunity of a lifetime.  If there is any fault with the opera, it's the raggedness of the story.  One is never quite sure if the adulterous wife has really strayed or simply been seduced against her will.  What matter.  There is ample reason for regret and remorse - where would opera be without guilt to propel its action?  The resultant music is gorgeous.  I did wonder if the huge sets in Act I and III weren't a bit over-blown.  This is hardly the setting of a country parson.  I couldn't help wondering how he manages to live in a castle and preach in a church as grand as London's St. Paul's.  Ignore that.  Instead let this opera treat you to beautiful music, fine settings, and Verdi drama.  Each time I watch it I'm glad I found this forgotten treasure.  I shall return to it again, and again.",1268870400,6,1510,4.518518518518518
2730686,4,B000MGB3EE,"I pretty much bought this DVD because of Ms. Sharon Sweet. Man, I wish she kept singing and made more DVDs. She's one of the few perfect spintos that comes along once in a while. Placido is great, as always; very at home in the Verdi repertoire. Chernov and Plishka add to the UH-mazingness of voices.
My only problem is the set/production...it's just not my favorite and I got bored with it.",1252022400,4,392,4.458333333333333
2730687,5,B000MGB3EE,"I have nothing to add to the extensive main review but wish only to join with the second in expressing my own novice's enthusiastic response to this production. Whether or not this is considered major or minor Verdi, the Met proved that it is an opera that can stir deeper emotions and speak to the complexities of human responses. As pointed out by the others, Domingo, Sweet and Chernov, in the lead roles, were simply outstanding both in song and action, the supporting cast did all that could be asked of them, Levine and the Met orchestra demonstrated the success of the conductor's effort to make it among the best in the world, the video production was excellent.
A word should be said with regard to scenic design in this day of minimalism: the traditional approach here, measurably enhanced the power of the production as, it should be mentioned, did the costuming.
All in all, a very classy addition to the collections of opera on DVD.",1223856000,10,945,4.698795180722891
2730688,5,B000MGB3EE,"I invited friends over to watch Stiffelio.  It was a grand experience.  The singing voices were wonderful and the staging was great.  There wasn't a dry eye in the room when the opera ended.  Very, Very moving and I would recommend this production to any opera lover.",1220832000,5,267,4.617021276595745
2730689,5,B000MGB3EE,"Stiffelio is a GREAT opera. Lost for close to a century, it has been slow in making its way into the standard repertoire, but productions such as this one should further its cause as well as its reputation. This is frankly one of the best opera productions I've ever seen. Every facet is top of the line, from the orchestra to the singers to the stage production to the video direction. Prepare to be overwhelmed. And, if you've never seen or heard Stiffelio before, prepare to welcome a new opera into the canon of Verdi masterpieces.

Stiffelio, about a Protestant minister who learns that his wife has cheated on him while he was away, has a story that is closer to verismo opera than most of the other operas of that time in that it deals with regular people rather than kings and queens, gods and goddesses. Like verismo, the emotion is often pushed to a level that is melodramatic, even larger than life. Yet even those moments have the core of truth to them, because Stiffelio's characters are never less, or more, than human, defined as they are by human weakness. This is a very powerful opera, Bergmanesque(as in Ingmar) in that it deals with the conflict between the spiritual life and the earthly one. This juxtaposition is never more beautifully realized than at the end of act two, where Stiffelio has just learned of his wife's indiscretion and is prepared to kill her but is stayed by the voices of the congregation emanating from the church, singing about forgiveness. I was overpowered, and I'm not even a religious person! Then again, neither was Verdi, yet the great humanist was able to put aside his anticlericalism and create an astonishing vision of a man finding redemption through faith. This has always been a Verdian specialty, scenes where private agonies clash with public responsibilities. Probably the greatest example comes late in act three of Otello, where Otello has just finished spying on Iago and Cassio and is tormented with jealousy and thoughts of violence just as the horns signal the approach of the heralds. Trust me when I say that the scene I just described from Stiffelio is in that same league.

The music of this opera, which was written between Luisa Miller and Rigoletto, shows the composer's progress. There is very little standard recitative, it's almost all through composed, with fewer arias and more concerted music than the norm, creating an undeviating dramatic flow. Many scenes show the richness in orchestration that would characterize his later operas. Also, this is one of the few Verdi operas where the tenor character is the most demanding role. The uniqueness of Stiffelio might tempt some to write it off as a curiosity, yet the power of the story and the passion of the music demand that it be taken seriously as one of Verdi's most beautifully realized triumphs.

""Taken seriously"" certainly applies to this production. The commitment of all involved is palpable. James Levine's orchestra plays with an extraordinary Verdian fervor and flair, yet is never less than subtle in the more pensive, nuanced moments. This lesser known score couldn't be in more capable hands. Under Levine, Stiffelio becomes an emotional powerhouse, it sounds like an opera that belongs in the same class as the more oft performed Verdi masterworks of that period. On to the singers. Placido Domingo gives a performance of Otelloesque intensity. Here is a singer who cares more about dramatic authenticity than strict vocal beauty, and his voice, while lovely, is also savage and tumultuous, just like his acting. Domingo has always excelled in the more angst-ridden roles, Don Jose, Cannio, Otello, the difference here being that Stiffelio offers an opportunity to explore the dawning of wisdom as well, and redemption, and Domingo accepts the challenge. I wasn't familiar with Sharon Sweet, our Lina, prior to watching this. I understand her career at the Met was shortlived. Still, it's easy to see why she demanded so much enthusiasm during her brief period in the spotlight, her singing is explosive yet also beautiful and, dare I say it, sweet. She is also a compelling dramatic actress, her wayward, fatalistic wife, the catalyst for this tragedy, is never less than a sympathetic character. Vladimir Chernov matches the tenor and soprano's intensity as Stankar, Lina's father, the tragic counterpart to Stiffelio, his foil if you will, who yields to the same impulse to violence that initially drives Stiffelio, unlike Stiffelio he only yields to the power of forgiveness after sating his need for bloodshed. Paul Plishka has a smaller role as Jorg, but no less important, since he functions as Stiffelio's conscience, his voice of reason. His stoic compassion is mesmerizing. Regarding Giancarlo del Monaco's production, this is an advertisement for tradtional productions when they are done well. The dark, brooding sets, while effective at setting the mood of the piece, are also light on abstraction, on symbols, they allow the singers and the music to impart the opera's profundity. The settings are elaborate and in their own way as essential to the performance's success as the singers and orchestra. Brian Large's video direction is as polished and cinematic and as unintrusive as ever, using closeups during moments of extreme emotional distress but also pulling back his camera when necessary to allow the viewer to take it all in. I've never seen a Met broadcast look better.

One final note. I persist in objecting to this opera's overture. I don't approve of cuts in most instances, particularly in operas that are under two hours, but if I were ever to consider making a cut to any score, this overture would have to be one of the first I would consider. For one thing, Stiffelio is a short, intimate opera, close to a chamber piece in some respects, so a ten minute overture seems inappropriate. Second, although the overture does use motifs from the actual score, the texture and pacing of the piece are too jaunty and therefore a poor match for the subject matter and mood of the opera itself. It sounds more like something Donizetti would have written for one of his lighter operas, it has a standard bel canto feel to it whereas Stiffelio is one of those operas that does its best to break free of bel canto conventions. Basically, Stiffelio's overture is unworthy of the man who just prior to that wrote the brilliant prelude to Luisa Miller and the stirring overture to La Battaglia di Legnano. More than that, it is unworthy of the opera. Despite all that, Levine and his orchestra give a spirited reading. I'm certainly not about to allow a weak overture spoil what is otherwise a beautiful opera and a magnificent production and an overwhelming viewing experience. Nor should you.",1184544000,71,6759,4.936731107205624
8168553,4,B000MGB3EE,Great music.  Placido was wonderful.  James Levine and orchestra were fantastic as usual.  Sharon Sweet was laboring so much between breaths that she screeched when she inhaled quickly. She has a beautiful but limited voice.  She was no match for Domingo both vocally and physically.  All in all it was a very good experience.,1442707200,,326,4.962962962962963
8168554,3,B000MGB3EE,"Question to those familiar with this opera, or native Italian speakers ...

In Act 3 we have Stiffelio confronting his wife over her infidelity.  It is a major dramatic scene in the opera.  He demands a divorce and we hear the following dialogue:

LINA
Sempre v'amo (I will always love you)
Testimonio Iddio ne chiamo (I call God as my witness)

STIFFELIO
Ma colui! (But he !)

LINA
Fu tradimento (It was a betrayal)

STIFFELIO
Vi tradiva! (He betrayed you?)

LINA
Si (Yes)

STIFFELIO
Fia spento (He will be killed)
Io n'ho il dritto (I have the right to do it)

Question:  Is the translation correct?  It doesn't make sense.  Why would a wife apologize for an affair by saying the guy she was messing around with betrayed her?

If one is apologizing for an affair, one might say:  I don't know how it happened;  it was meaningless;  he or she seduced me;  ... but surely not, he or she ""betrayed"" me.  That's like saying, ""I'm coming back because the affair didn't work out.""

What am I missing?",1440979200,2,996,4.48876404494382
8168555,5,B000MGB3EE,"I can't fathom how any production of Giuseppe Verdi's until-recently-underrated opera STIFFELIO could top this one, from the Metropolitan Opera in 1993.  Placido Domingo, Sharon Sweet, Vladimir Chernov, and Paul Plishka make up a distinguished ensemble; Chernov, in his Met Opera debut, shines in his haunting Act III aria.  The production's sets, costumes, and stage and video direction are all superb; it is refreshing to see a Verdi opera set in Verdi's own time.  If you love Verdi, you can't possibly go wrong with this DVD.",1438646400,,529,5.127906976744186
8168556,5,B000MGB3EE,"Yes, this is the version that made me fall in love with the opera when I first saw it on ""Live from the Met"" some years ago. In my mind, it goes along with ""La Traviata"" as an opera based more on domestic and everyday life than on high melodrama. Who cares about clowns who are somehow supposed to be sentimentally justified -- just because ""clowns are people, too"" -- for murdering their wives on grounds of infidelity? Give me a minister who lives up to the ideals of his religion by forgiving and being reconciled with an erring wife! I love this opera, and I love this production of it.",1432771200,,590,4.324324324324325
8168557,2,B000MGB3EE,"One word: boring.  Domingo is superb.  Sharon Sweet, unfortunately, does not belong to the age of DVD's, which requires looks as well as voice, but she was also superb.  So, what did I dislike?  The idiotic plot. Much ado about nothing. Also, a production that, though it corresponded to the values of the religion involved, failed to catch the eye.  To be heard, not seen.",1427760000,,373,4.676923076923077
8168558,5,B000MGB3EE,"This is a traditionally staged, traditionally costumed and excellently sung performance. If anything negative could be said, it would be solely that Sharon Sweet, as Lina, is not physically consistent with the authors original description of that character. This is a keeper.",1424044800,,275,5.571428571428571
8168559,4,B000MGB3EE,"Stiffelio (reworked as the later Aroldo) was Verdi's 16th opera (after Luisa Miller and before Rigoletto) and dates from 1850. It disappeared from the stage for a century after Verdi withdrew it in 1856. It's early history was checkered due to the interference of the censors, and so what the opening night audience in Trieste saw was quite different from what you see on this DVD, which is much closer to Verdi's initial intent, thanks to the discovery of the original score (thought to be lost) in 1993. In the Italy of the Austrian Empire, a married priest with an adulteress wife was a non sequitor, and not to be condoned by the censors. So the story as we see it now never made it the stage in Trieste. Thus, this DVD records the first major production after the original score was discovered, and it is a beautiful production. The singers, Domingo as Stiffelio, Sharon Sweet as his wife Lina, Vladimir Chernov as her father, Col. Stankar, and Paul Plishka as Jorg, make a good ensemble, supported brilliantly by the Met Orchestra conducted by James Levine. Domingo was still in his prime and is very good throughout. Paul Plishka is ever-reliable as the cleric Jorg, but Chernov really stands out in this performance (it helps that he gets some of the best music). I was not previously familiar with him, but he is simply outstanding. I cannot say the same for Sharon Sweet, who has lovely lower and middle registers, but her top end too often teeters perilously close to unmusical shrieking. Her singing is the only reason I did not give this DVD 5 stars. The music is excellent throughout and typical for middle Verdi, and it is clear he is moving beyond the conventions of bel canto. Though there are highlights throughout all 3 acts, THE musical highlight for me is the duet between Stankar and Lina in the first act, ""Ed io pure in faccia agli uomini...Or meco venite"" - just gorgeous. As to one reviewer's comments regarding the overture, my general rule is ""never cut good music,"" (e.g., the frequent cut of the Wolf's Crag scene in Act 3 of Lucia - what a crime!), and whether or not the overture is too jaunty for the subject (perhaps an accurate criticism), it is still a most enjoyable overture. I am grateful that Levine and the Met Orchestra play it with their usual precision and panache. Also, it is refreshing in this era of minimalist sets and putting Rigoletto in Las Vegas, to see a traditional production with well-crafted, atmospheric sets that reflect the composer's intention. The video is what you would expect from a recording of this vintage - 4:3 aspect ratio, quite acceptable video, though not great. The sound is better than serviceable, though, and overall, this DVD will provide lots of unexpected enjoyment from an opera with which even opera fans are mostly unfamiliar. If you like Verdi, buy this. You won't regret it. If you don't like Verdi, you have my sincere sympathies.",1387065600,3,2917,4.7215686274509805
8168560,5,B000MGB3EE,"Infrequently produced and probably overshadowed by the advent of the breakout three, Rigoletto, Traviata, and Trovatore, this is a must for the devotee.  Undoubtedly the choice among DVD releases this is nearly an indispensable document.",1381622400,2,237,5.771428571428571
8168561,5,B000MGB3EE,"This opera belongs to the early Middle period (1850 - 1858), and was written just before the better known ""Trilogy"" of Rigoletto, La Traviata, and Il Trovatore. Placido Domingo gives a fine performance as Stiffelio. His mature age and acting is convincing as the betrayed preacher-husband, but the soprano playing his wife is less believable for having an affair with a younger and better looking seducer. For that she was a bit too overweight. But from the point of view of the staging, set and costumes, the opera was very well done. The music is beautiful. Too bad that the opera is seldom performed.",1355184000,2,603,4.8076923076923075
8168562,3,B000MGB3EE,"Verdi composed Stiffelio, to lyrics by Francesco Maria Piave, during his great middle period, the period of Rigoletto, Trovatore, and Triaviata. Its first performance was in Trieste in 1850. A drastically revised version, with the action removed to England, was mounted in 1857, after which the opera sank, score and all, into oblivion. The discovery of a copyist's score in Naples in the 1960's, and of an autograph score in 1992, led to its revival.

The title character, Rev. Muller a/k/a Stiffelio, sung wonderfully in this 1993 Met production by Placido Domingo, is a married Protestant cleric and traveling evangelist living and working in a German-speaking country, rather like Austria, somewhere near Italy. While he is away proselytizing, his wife Lina, here the unremarkable Sharon Sweet, dallies with a count whose dramatic exit from one of their trysts - by leaping from a bedroom window into the river - is witnessed by a boatsman and relayed to Stiffelio. For most of two acts, Lina is traumatized by guilt, Lina's father - a uniformed colonel, wretch of a patriarch, and stand-in for the state - terrorizes Lina and her lover as he takes it upon himself, for the presumed good of his daughter and marriage and the state, to hide the truth from Stiffelio, the count keeps a low profile as he tries to win Lina back, and Paul Plishka, as a church elder, periodically shows up to lift his hands and sing ""Pace!"" As this summary suggests, the plot - which scandalized the Austrian censors in the 1850's - has little or nothing to say to today's opera-goers. ""Get over it. See a marriage counselor. Do you love him or not? Do you love the other guy or not?"" we would ask Lina. For today's audience, the state, the church, parents' wishes for and control of their adult children, and even marriage have largely withered away.

Rigoletto is an underdog who truly cares for his daughter; we sympathize with him. The elder Germont is a bourgeois prig, but his son is involved with a demimondaine; if we don't fully sympathize with him, we can at least sympathize with his attempt to reason with Violetta. Otello, of course, deals with presumed infidelity, and he deals with it badly, but it is a personal struggle, so we can sympathize with him. On the other hand there is nothing to sympathize with in Stiffelio, and the music only occasionally echoes - a gavotte here, a choral celebration there - the great scores of Verdi's middle period. Stiffelio is not a masterpiece, but this is a workmanlike production, with some fine singing, that is well filmed.",1275264000,9,2563,4.796380090497737
