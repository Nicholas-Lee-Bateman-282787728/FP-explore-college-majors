8184144,5,B000OAVICA,The DVDs arrived in unopened condition as advertised and pretty well packaged.  The shipment arrived earlier than expected and the DVDs look to be in excellent condition.  A very worthwhile purchase at a good price - especially since the third and fourth scrapbooks are so hard to find.,1457308800,,286,4.9375
8184145,5,B000OAVICA,"I saw this series (Marmalade Boy) while I was in college, and it was nice to find it here on Amazon in its entirety.  (It's all mine!!)  The DVDs come in four boxes (one for each season of Marmalade Boy), and the packaging is really cute.  I liked all the pictures, but especially the translator notes and interviews with the people who made the series so special.

The story is a little weird at first but if you just go with it, you will be entertained.  The SUBTITLED version is the way to go, of course, but for non-Japanese speakers who don't feel like reading subtitles (you're missing out...!) the dubbed version is an option you can choose on the DVD menu.  Just do the subtitled version.  Serious.  Why watch anime dubbed???  Like 75% percent of the experience is taken away.

The music from the series is really, really fun.  It's very catchy, very moving.

You will enjoy Marmalade Boy!",1271030400,4,897,4.5375

8184147,5,B000OAVICA,"Marmalade Boy was released in Japan as a manga in 1992, and as an anime in 1994.  It was an instant hit.  It quickly started showing up arround the world in various languages in the form of Fansubs, and was popular world wide.

It was finally released in the US in Manga form sometime in 2002 or 2003, and a year or two later the Anime was released.

I would personally advise anyone who likes dramas to check this one out.

A few things to consider:

To be blunt, the dubbing sucks.  If you are a long time fan of the serries, it is still a must buy, just stick to the subtitles. If you have never seen the serries before, it is still a must buy.  I would still advise to stick to the subtitles.

The animation looks a bit dated, but that is because the serries is over ten years old!  It is still awesome.

The storyline is a little strange and contrived at first.  Give it a little time, once you get past the first eppisode it is fine!",1215820800,5,939,4.0989010989010985
