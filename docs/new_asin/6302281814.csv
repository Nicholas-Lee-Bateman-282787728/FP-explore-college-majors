451694,5,6302281814,"Originally filmed in 3-D, MISS SADIE THOMPSON stars the perfectly cast Rita Hayworth as the sexy nymphet, with Jose Ferrer as the corrupt minister who tries to ""reform"" her.
Sadie finds herself stranded while trying to get to a ""gig"", and gets caught up in the rabble of soldiers patrolling the South Pacific.  A naive young officer (Aldo Ray) courts the girl while she is being tracked down by the sadistic minister, too weak to practice what he preaches.
This effort to transform the gritty moralistic drama into a semi-musical works somewhat, although Hayworth's vocals were dubbed here.  She tries to be grating when she sings, though she's more Mary Poppins than Mayflower Madam, singing with the island children.

Rita Hayworth is, well, Rita Hayworth. No explanation is provided for why she, as Miss Sadie Thompson, was thrown out of San Francisco to land on a small Marine base in the South Pacific.

This movie is well worth watching, if only for Rita Hayworth's fabulous, ""The Heat is On"" dance number.  But I don't understand why it's not available on DVD, given that ""Trouble in Texas,"" ""Charlie Chan in Egypt"" and a few of her other, early, and not as interesting films, are.  I'd also like to see ""Tonight and Every Night"" on DVD as well.  That film has some great dance sequences.  Given how little Rita was allowed to produce in her best years, at least Sony/Columbia Pictures ought to produce the better ones in current technology.  My own view is that Rita Hayworth's talent went far beyond the glam image, both in acting and dancing, and should be recognized as such.  I read the book ""Being Rita Hayworth,"" which was an interesting analysis of Hollywood and actors such as Rita's efforts to forge an identity and claim the value of their work, despite all the hype and iconography.",1222041600,5,1048,5.392638036809816
451801,3,6302281814,"Rita Hayworth's performance as Sadie Thompson is okay, but it can't hold a candle to Joan Crawford's brilliant 1932 portrayal. The film is a glossy, technicolor semi-musical, but it seems like its heart was not in the story, restrained by '50s moral codes (and therefore less moving). This film is more about Hollywood glamour and Rita Hayworth's body, which is great if you love classic films, but don't expect a masterpiece (which it very well could have been). It would have been much more entertaining in 3-D.",1105056000,,513,4.908045977011494
451802,4,6302281814,"This 1953 film stars Rita Hayworth in a loosely adapted version of a Somerset Maugham story.  It takes place on a American occupied Pacific Island where the marines, and especially Aldo Ray, are all quite smitten with Miss Sadie Thompson, a tough and sexy lady who loves to party and who is forced to spend some  time there because her ship is quarantined.  Jose Ferrer, cast in the role of an angry and dour preacher quarantined there too, manages to arrange for her to be deported. He has his own weaknesses, however, which are revealed as the story progresses.  The inevitable tragic conclusion has a typical Hollywood ending, but the basic theme is there.
Ms. Hayworth sure looks pretty.  She has flaming red hair and wears brightly colored clothes and every movement of her body draws the eye.  As she can't sing, though, she lip synchs through several non-memorable musical numbers and her acting abilities vary from scene to scene.  Occasionally, the actress in her shines through, but mostly it's just Rita Hayworth, the movie star, mouthing her words.  Jose Ferrer fares better in the acting department and so does Aldo Ray, but this film was not made to show off anyone's acting.  It was originally released in 3-D and it's the beautiful Pacific Island as well as the producer's attempt to push the envelope on the censorship code that drove this picture.  Also, as it was made in the fifties, it reflected the general moral code of the time as well as a  dose of pop psychology.  I enjoyed the video.  It's a good story and there's enough tension and romance to keep it moving swiftly. But, alas, its just a bit too overblown.",1008374400,12,1637,4.701754385964913

7824080,3,6302281814,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

My guess is that many will not recall this film as part of that initial 3-D wave that took place during the fifties. I was surprised to find that it was released that way. I was even more surprised to learn that it did well at the box office. For me it wasn't that great a movie, but it was interesting to view and consider how racy it was considered at the time. In a world where prostitutes are recurring characters on TV shows and porn is available at the press of a button this movie seems quaint in its moral dilemma.

Rita Hayworth stars as the title character, a brassy woman on her way to another island in the South Pacific just after the war whose ship strands her on a military base when it has problems. Thompson garners the attention of every military man on the island, all wishing they were the one to romance her but who lose out to Sgt. Phil OHara (Aldo Ray) who falls hard for her.

Unfortunately for Sadie another visitor to the island is on hand as well, Alfred Davidson (Jose Ferrer), the son of missionaries who is there to carry on his fathers work. This is the sort of character who finds fault in most everyone else but himself, in particular the way the island natives behave and in Sadie who he recognizes. When he follows up on his hunch he discovers that Sadie is a woman wanted for solicitation in Honolulu and he blackmails her into returning to the states to serve her time. The conflict between the fun loving independent woman and the staunch religious fanatic should be the center piece of the film. And yet it never quite feels that way.

Therein lies the biggest problem with this movie. Based on the short story by W. Somerset Maugham the heart of the story (as well as several other movies based on the tale) revolves around these two as well as the temptation that Davidson feels for Sadie. But that temptation is rarely on display here until very near the end of the film when suddenly he is drawn to her, shattering her changed outlook on life. This should have been a smoldering item that grew as the film moved forward and instead here it feels like a random explosion.

The pacing of the film seems leaden but the acting is great. Hayworth turns in a fantastic performance with what she is provided and does a wonderful bit of singing and dancing for the military personnel at a local club. But Rays character feels forced, ready to marry Sadie at the drop of a hat. The horn dog nature of the soldiers and sailors in the film is at best like a caricature and so over the top you wonder how they survive with little to no women to look at.

If made today (and Im surprised it hasn't been) Hollywood would have a heyday with this story, pitting a staunch conservative religious fanatic against an easy going free spirit who simply wants to have fun. But that shows the difference in time periods when you consider that at the time this film was considered racy and morally questionable. For me the entire movie honestly felt kind of boring. I found myself dozing on more than one occasion.

But for those who love the film and Rita Hayworth you cant find a better presentation of this movie. Twilight Time (whose praises I constantly sing) has done the film right with as clear and clean a presentation on blu-ray as you will find. Included with the movie are extras like an isolated music & effects track, audio commentary track with film historians David Del Valle and Steven Peros, an introduction by actress Patricia Clarkson and the original film trailer. I may have to watch this one start to finish with the commentary track on to see what I was missing. For most it will be a movie to bypass but for fans of classic movies and Hayworth youll add this one to your collection.",1473811200,2,3782,4.4409221902017295
7824081,5,6302281814,"I can only judge this film from what I remember of film style from the '50's when I originally saw this film in 3-D--mainly because Rita Hayworth, in my opinion, was the most beautiful woman ever to appear on film. This 3-D version that I got from Screen Archives for a really good price, is beautiful. The colors are a little washed out--not so much it matters--after all, the film is over 60 years old--but the 3-D is a joy, much more so than how we had to view it back then, headaches and all. No  such problems here. The story (from Maugham) has been Bowdlerized a bit, but is still a fascinating glimpse into Rita's acting life. The rape scene is carefully stylized, but the indication is clearly there. Jose Ferrer is very good and Aldo Ray also does a yeoman's job as a Marine Sgt. Love having this film about as much as I loved getting the 3-D of Kiss Me Kate! A must have for film buffs who have a 3-D set and player.",1472083200,2,926,4.231638418079096

And jose ferah is great as the hypocritical moral crusaders  What isn't great is how they took ""Rain' and then censored it to this version. Rain was made with the great Joan Crawford in 1932, and before that in a silent version and a play.  However the censors made this much more wholesome and removed the rape scene. Still , this is well worth owning for the quality of the 3d and the great perforamance of rita hayworth.  She was so great and her life was a mess romance wise.. So it really shows here ,  she is natural looking and all power here. With as many cirtics say one of the most sexy musical numbers in movie history in this movie.  SO grab this on 3d blu ray.
