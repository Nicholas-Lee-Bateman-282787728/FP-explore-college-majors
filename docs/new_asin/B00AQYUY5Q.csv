5473950,4,B00AQYUY5Q,I've watched a lot of British thrillers and usually can guess the ending before it arrives. Not this time. Grabs your attention and keeps you guessing until the end.,1380067200,9,165,4.724137931034483

5473952,4,B00AQYUY5Q,I enjoyed the movie and it was intriguing mystery that I wanted to watch all the episodes. The only problem I had with the movie was the ending. It could have been 15 minutes longer and explained the conclusion better.,1375142400,11,218,4.475
5473953,4,B00AQYUY5Q,"Given the acting prowess of David Suchet and Philip Glenister, I thought this series would be a hands-down winner on every front.  Don't get me wrong: it is good. But in my opinion, it isn't five-stars great. It has action in abundance and Philip Glenister plays the likable 'tough-guy"" with his usual aplomb,  He's a slightly shabby private investigator who gets embroiled in a situation he doesn't understand by a beautiful and mysterious woman he cannot resist. (Kind of a cliche, yes? But no matter . . . .) Before he knows it, his own life is in danger -- but by whom? And more to the point, why? How does his own past have a bearing on this case?  Having sat through all the episodes (and having enjoyed them to some extent) I still am unsure of the plot details. The action tends to obscure the limitations of the plot line and carries the viewer along in the swiftness of its wake. It is entertaining to be sure, but it is not a deeply satisfying or finely-crafted mystery.",1370908800,60,981,4.4692737430167595
5473954,5,B00AQYUY5Q,"I WATCHED all the episodes in one night. A thrill a minute, good characters, motivation of each very plausible. And I like Gleneister in everything he is in. Never for one minute did I guess the ending, the villains. The Brits know how to make a series that keeps one guessing and satisfied.",1368835200,45,291,4.509433962264151

8556706,4,B00AQYUY5Q,"With its stellar cast, London setting, and topical political edge, Hidden has ber-British bonafides. However ... and in spite of our (anti)hero being a lawyer, it follows the mythology of the tough American private eye formula pretty much note-for-note: beautiful, mysterious female client who won't tell everything she knows; picaresque, rough-around-the-edges protagonist who doesn't mind bending the legal niceties when necessary, and who of course falls for said client; powerful, unseen forces at work, and long-buried secrets the powers don't want resurrected; irretrievably corrupt society on the brink of moral and political collapse. All is done with considerable panache and energy. Philip Glenister stands out as our Jason Statham-esque tough guy hero, while Thekla Reuten, David Suchet, and Anna Chancellor add lively support.
The overall tone and subject matter reminded me a lot of State of Play (the UK version), only there the main character was a journalist and not a private detective (by any other name). My only quibbles: a certain murkiness in the story line that makes it difficult to follow; too many flashbacks.",1427241600,,1135,5.454545454545454
8556707,5,B00AQYUY5Q,"This is an excellent 2011 conspiracy thriller from the BBC.  I ordered it primarily because of the actors:  David Suchet (Poirot); and Glenister - thinking he was one of my favourites, Robert (Hustle) and not the actual actor, his brother Philip (Ashes to Ashes, Life on Mars.)
  I especially enjoyed it because I had to pay attention.  Not every fact and clue are presented in the simplified, overtly obvious, everything explained manner that many may be used to seeing.  As the initial story of the solicitor and a mysterious woman unfolds, tales of rich moguls and political bigwigs plotting assassinations and cover-ups emerge.  I certainly don't want to spoil anything; suffice to say, the final twists make one pause for thought.
  This is not a high action, gory, sex-filled series.  There are brief scenes of people being killed.  At the beginning, a woman starts to unbutton her blouse but nothing happens and a bit later, a man lies covered in bed as he talks to a woman who's dressing - that's it for sex.
  I've already watched this twice:  once for me and again with friends who also enjoyed it.  It's definitely one I'll watch again next year.",1425600000,,1157,4.7727272727272725
8556708,3,B00AQYUY5Q,"British thrillers are among my favorites.  Found this one a tad confusing, and wasn't particularly enamored of the barrister who is trying to find out what happened to his brother whom he thought was dead.  The central conflict wasn't particularly compelling for me.  There are mysterious characters.  It's hard to determine the good-bad guys.  There's a government scandal in the background.  But if you like kind of murky, puzzling plots with frequent flashbacks and a grimy, somewhat unsavory but likable main character this may be a five star show for you.  I loved the English scenery.  3.5 stars",1413072000,,601,5.061224489795919

Though this wasn't bad, it was a onetime viewing only.",1392336000,,120,4.260869565217392
8556711,1,B00AQYUY5Q,The immediate nudity and sex that took place was not required and therefore I didn't watch the rest of the episode or the set.  The set was thrown away.  Ratings on the set would be helpful for viewers such as me.,1389052800,6,213,4.170731707317073
8556712,4,B00AQYUY5Q,it was very interesting.....rather unnerving. But acting is very good as the Brits can always do it. I will watch it again.,1386633600,,123,4.636363636363637
8556713,4,B00AQYUY5Q,"'Hidden' is a TV series that aired on BBCOne in 2011. It made it's way to the states, and now we are in possession of the mystery.

The series has at it's base a lawyer or soliciter, Harry Venn, played by Philip Glenister, who starts looking for a man from his past, at the request of a beautiful soliciter, Gina Hawkes , played by Thekla Reuten.  Hawkes is searching for a missing alibi witness for her client. Philip finds that he is now going back 20 years to a crime committed by his brother, Mark. Mark died in that crime, and Harry has been looked at as the driver in the get away car. Harry is not without sin, as he was in prison as a teen, he has a son who is a teen, and he has not been a good father. Harry seems to have many women and several exes. He has had success as a small town soliciter in the big murky city of London. Harry has the unshaved and unkempt look that is so popular. He has several colleagues, all hoods of some sort or another, but are good at cracking codes in computers and getting info that is needed.

Into this mess, we find David Suchet who plays Sir Nigel Fountain, a judge who seems to be politically motivated. He is the caretaker to Gina Hawkes, who went to live with him after her parents were killed. This quickly becomes a political thriller with murders amongst the daily activities. We are not sure what is going on as the tension increases, Harry and Gina start working together, but all remains murky and mysterious.

This thriller could have been so much more mysterious if it did not keep going back to the flashback of Harry, his brother killing two policemen and the drive away. This series has four episodes and there were at least five of these flashbacks, all the same per episode. Very tiring and seems to be a filler. The series was well acted and for the most part well written.  I just wish I knew what was going on. If this is not renewed, we may never know.

Recommended. prisrob 11-1--13",1384128000,13,1951,4.288043478260869
