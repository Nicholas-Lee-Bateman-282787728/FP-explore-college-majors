2119611,5,B0002TSZFQ,"My three-year-old daughter LOVES this series and watches it OVER and OVER. The series is great, and even my wife and I enjoy watching it with her. (How many parents can say that?)  The songs by Van Dyke Parks are really wonderful (including the Emmy-winning, ""Blame it on the Rain"" - I'd buy the CD of just the Harold songs if there were one!)  There is another series (not this HBO series) which are not nearly as entertaining as this one.  Sharon Stone is just perfect as the narrator of these tales, and the animation is top notch.  You will be glad you have the entire series - they're GREAT!",1098489600,8,596,4.390909090909091
2119612,5,B0002TSZFQ,"We haven't seen the dvd yet, but we have all the episodes saved on our Tivo because he asks for them by name. He loves loves loves Harold and the Purple Crayon, and so do his friends. He watches it every night before he goes to bed and it helps him get more ready for bed. DH and I like it more than a lot of other kids series' because it isn't annoying for us.

2119639,5,B0002TSZFQ,We have had this for about 3 years and on occasion my 8 year old grandson still looks at it. We think it is terrific. You cannot go wrong on this. Sharon Stone is the narrator on the CD.,1402099200,,186,3.7948717948717947

2119642,5,B0002TSZFQ,"My kids LOVE this!  My friend introduced it to me and I was thrilled to find the whole series so economically priced!  Its stories are engaging enough that I have watched them more than once.  And they aren't overstimulating at all.  Sometimes, I put it on as a wind down when they are tired.  Usually, even my four-year-old will drop off for a nap!",1389312000,,349,4.390625

It is creative and helps with imaginative play, which in our video came infused zombie world, is precious indeed.  The music is fun and I love that Harold is in a little sleeper like my boy.

2119650,5,B0002TSZFQ,"My daughter was gifted this at Christmas a few years ago. I wasn't sure what I thought at first. There are two or three songs per episode, all sung by the same person, and the pace is less-hurried and harried than a lot of the kid shows that are made now. (We were used to Dora yelling at us.) It didn't take long before it became a favorite for my daughter, and I love it too. The episodes are sweet, thoughtful, and creative. There's an episode where Harold's fish dies, and a mermaid helps to understand what happened to Goldie. Harold has to problem solve a lot, but not in the ""which path should I take? The RED path, the BLUE path..."" etc. Sharon Stone narrates, and there isn't a whole lot of talking from Harold; it feels a lot like a parent reading to a child. The songs have a relaxed, but upbeat feel (think Jack Johnson). I highly recommend this series!!",1380240000,3,866,4.319018404907975
2119651,4,B0002TSZFQ,"This seemed alright. The package could have been nicer. Just a couple of DVDs in a case. It is for a small child and they will enjoy it, but it could be presented more nicely.",1379894400,,175,4.0285714285714285
2119652,2,B0002TSZFQ,This was not worth the money.  My grandson was bored with it.  I'll try it on my 1 yr old granddaughter in awhile.,1377734400,,114,3.9130434782608696
2119653,4,B0002TSZFQ,"This HBO animated series starts out with a really nice adaptation (and expansion) of Crockett Johnson's original story. The next dozen-or-so episodes are mostly new material, but remain pretty true to the spirit of Johnson's stories -- they celebrate the magnificent creativity and delight that a solitary child can generate for himself or herself, so long as that kid is happy and secure. One carp:  Van Dyke Parks, a musician for whom I have tremendous respect, does the songs and I just plain don't like 'em.  He often seems to forget that he's writing songs for kids (one tune has references to Orwell, another to Galileo); BUT!! My two-year-old, while no more enthusiastic about the music than I am, loves everything else about the show and will watch it as long as we'll let him.",1376611200,,785,4.807407407407408

2119657,5,B0002TSZFQ,"Harold is great.  My daughter watched it occasionally growing up on HBO.  To have her own dvd set, thrills her.  Very entertaining children's stories with great messages.",1370995200,,170,5.222222222222222
2119658,5,B0002TSZFQ,"This DVD is simply fantastic. The story (we own one of the books as well) has stood the test of time for a reason. My father loved it as a child, I enjoyed it, and now my son can't get enough of Harold.  Sharon Stone truly does a great job narrating. Remember Basic Instinct? You just have to push away any image of her from that movie, and realize this is the exact opposite. Ha Ha. The imagination, creativity, and simplicity of Harold is second to none.",1369180800,,456,4.241379310344827
2119659,5,B0002TSZFQ,This DVD didn't have the story I was looking for.  I was hoping for Harold and the Invisible Witch but It wasn't there.

2119662,5,B0002TSZFQ,We all love Harold. It is perfect for calming a toddler when getting close to bedtime. Our grandson enjoys it thoroughly. Lovely background music and very nicely done.,1362268800,,167,5.0

2119664,5,B0002TSZFQ,"I bought these for my 4 year old because he loves Harold and the Purple Crayon, but HBO stopped showing it. He loves it! And has been watching it almost nightly since I gave it to him. For the price, it really is worth it!",1356220800,,222,3.9555555555555557
2119665,3,B0002TSZFQ,"I bought this for my 2 yr old, we already had a harold dvd at home n couldn't find them anywhere.

2119667,5,B0002TSZFQ,"We love Harold in the books and this show has the same feel to it. The music and narration is mellow and sweet. The ""I Remember Goldie"" episode was great for helping our kids deal with the loss of a pet.",1354579200,,203,3.975609756097561

2119670,3,B0002TSZFQ,"After loving the books as a kid, I now read them to my own children, yet wanted the video version on hand to see how the producers made the adaptation. (Sigh). Emmy-winning or not, the HBO Family adaptation replaces the child's imagination with that of the animation company and pads the storylines to fill 22 minutes for each episode. The pan-and-scan version that Captain Kangaroo ran back in the 50s seemed so much better because it stuck to the drawings and text of the book and let the child do the extrapolating. I know this is how it's done today, but it's so sad. I think I'll keep the DVDs on the shelf for now.",1332806400,7,620,4.4
2119671,4,B0002TSZFQ,My 2 year old would watch this on cable television but not enough episodes came on to her satisfaction. She loves this DVD set she can watch them all over and over and loves it!!!! Great buy!!!,1321228800,,193,4.243243243243243
2119672,5,B0002TSZFQ,Harold is so well done and my son simply loves it. Watch a few episodes on HBO and if your kids like it you will have to get this DVD so when they demand it you are all ready to plop them down for a 1/2 hour or more.  And tossed in for the parents: Sharon Stone narrates. Don't sit down Sharon.,1320710400,,294,3.7419354838709675

While watching the older version he asked his mom why Harold had on white PJ's and what happened to Harlods Blue PJ's. They put in his new video with the blue Pj's and he continued to watch it. The next day when I went to visit he wanted to watch Harold after watching for a few minutes he told me that Harold had on white pj's last night but mamma and daddy changed him to his blue pj's. His mom had to explain to me what had happened the night before and that they had not actually changed Harolds pj's, only the video. Parents be warned Harold is dressed differently in the old version than he is in the newer edition and the kids seem to notice!",1293580800,,805,4.166666666666667

2119687,5,B0002TSZFQ,"Im not sure what it is about ""Harold"" that captures my 3 year old and the pack of 2-5 year olds represented in these reviews.  it might be that it gives kids permission to imagine the world as they want.  Harold is bright eyed, practical,  and full of vision and determination.  He loves his dog Lilac and he loves the glow of the moon.  The ""Harold"" series was done for HBO way back in 2001.  Wouldn't it be great if Sharon Stone, Van Dyke Park and the whole Harold gang could do a couple more episodes almost a decade later?  Here's hoping,  In the meantime, pick up the complete series for your kids!",1269907200,,603,4.274336283185841

It is a great supplement to inspire your child to read.",1267056000,2,300,4.067796610169491
2119689,2,B0002TSZFQ,This is not the Harold I expected from the Scholastic Collection. Colors are nice but Harold rarely draws - he is part of things around him and does not draw his environment. A disappointment when you've seen the other one and expected like creativity. Kids familiar with the other felt like this too.,1265673600,4,301,4.69811320754717

2119693,5,B0002TSZFQ,"I purchased the complete series because our son loved the DVD we checked out from the library! It has a large number of episodes, and so for the price you are getting a fantastic amount of playing time. Sharon Stone does an excellent job at narration, and has a soothing voice that my son doesn't have to strain to understand. The episodes have great songs, and our son is already memorizing complex musical stanzas. Nice product, great series!

2119694,4,B0002TSZFQ,"My toddler LOVES Harold. I would have given this five stars had both DVDs worked. The second one just wouldn't play, in numerous DVD players. Sad times! I am a NO TV!! mom most of the time. I liked this series because it is paced appropriately for a small child, teaches valuable lessons, and episodes are in 20-25 min. chunks. I would definitely recommend this series to other mindful mamas.",1238630400,,392,4.614285714285714
2119695,5,B0002TSZFQ,"The DVD is a nice way to present these Harold stories and some other very special stories too.  The Harold films were made in the 60s and 70s with some nice Jazz scores and interesting presentations.  The other books included are Smile for Auntie (my personal favorite), Drummer Hoff and The Mysterious Tadpole.  My only regret is that Scholastic didn't restore these films so they would be crisp and clear rather than grainy.",1222473600,4,426,4.808219178082192
2119706,5,B0002TSZFQ,"My Daughter (4 and 1/2) has practically worn out this DVD, she watches it so much. It is a video that is simple in nature and peaceful.  She is not a fan of movies that blow things up and violence, nor am I. She has even passed on this love of Harold to her cousins (ages 8 and 6).  When they come over they specically ask if they can watch it. When we brought this DVD with us abroad all her cousins who are under the age of 8 loved it as well. (they are fans of rockem sockem movies) So I found it to be a nice change for them.  Language was not a barrier for them to understand what was happening....NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE MIND AND THE POWER OF IMAGINATION A CHILD HAS!!!! THANK YOU HAROLD!!!",1219363200,,696,4.065693430656935

2119708,5,B0002TSZFQ,"My 3 year old grandson and his 2 year old twin brothers loved Where the Wild Things Are and other stories by Maurice Sendak, but they finally wore it out.  I bought them Harol and the Purple Crayon the complete series and their love of a DVD was renewed.  The 3 year old wakes up in the morning talking about it and the 2 year olds love the other stories.  I had Amazon mail Harold directly to my grandsons in Virginia so I haven't seen it personally, but my daughter-in-law says it is very well done.  It was a very good purchase.",1194048000,,531,4.176470588235294

2119710,4,B0002TSZFQ,My daughter loves this DVD but I wish they showed only the actual segments and not the opening and closing credits for each episode. It's almost like watching a DVD with commercials - it should have been edited out.,1177977600,8,215,4.538461538461538
2119711,5,B0002TSZFQ,"I have a 3.25 year old boy.  We got the book, and I thought ""okay, cool, nice. rather limited premise, though...""  then we caught these on HBO On Demand, and i was amazed at how much they could get out of that simple concept.  Sharon Stone's narration is lovely, the songs are really cool, the stories are excellent guides of emotional development and problem-solving for kids, the animation is simple and clean, yet still very eventful and engaging visually.  It's one of the very few programs that my son is thoroughly engaged in when he watches it.

So much better than that annoying Dora.  Buy two copies!",1172448000,3,609,4.644859813084112
2119712,5,B0002TSZFQ,"After watching Harold on HBO, our son loved it.  They stopped showing it, and it was not easy for him (2 1/2 at the time) to understand.  I ordered it, and it had all the episodes we had seen and then a few more!  I love it too.",1163116800,,228,3.7083333333333335
2119713,5,B0002TSZFQ,"I find the Harold series so appealing and so does my son. It is quiet, it is simple, it is calming, it is entertaining, it is creative, and it is so very imaginative. Harold, his crayon, his stuffed dog, and his creative mind are so different than most of the children's videos out there on the market. This isn't the Wiggles, Barney, or Doodle bops -- thankfully! This particular DVD edition is full of great stories. Each story isn't too long and are perfect if you want to cuddle up and watch 1 or 2 before bed. As others have pointed out in earlier reviews, you'll notice your child will enjoy (even more) coloring and creating artwork with his/her own crayons. I can't say enough wonderful things about this series. If you want a DVD that you can enjoy with your child - than this is it! We are Harold's biggest fans!",1163030400,4,822,4.4144736842105265
2119714,5,B0002TSZFQ,"My son absolutely loves Harold.  Overall, the shows are great; they integrate music and images really nicely.  The only caution I have to parents with young children is this:  One of the episodes is about Harold losing the moon so that he is left in the dark.  My three year old was never afraid of anything until he watched this episode.  He wanted to watch it over and over after he saw it the first time.  Then, at night in his bed, he was freaking out saying he saw an eye on his bed (a piece of metal on his bed that shone in the light of the night light) and he has been afraid of being in a separate room from me from time to time since.  Anyway, I would highly recommend the series; it is great wholesome fun- just don't let your child watch the one when Harold loses the moon.  Also, be sensitive to the fact that there is one sad episode where a goldfish dies.",1162684800,18,870,4.106508875739645
2119715,5,B0002TSZFQ,My now 3 1/2 yr old son began watching this version on HBO in Demand and loved it. It was the only thing he asked to watch over and over. It has not been available for the past month on In Demand so we went to the library and borrowed the original (1974 I think) Scholastic version. My son enjoyed it just as much as the Sharon Stone-narrated version. Both versions stimulate the creative mind and I feel that these series are overall so much better than much of the programming available for the preschool set. Overall a wonderful purchase....only one episode I had a hard time with (when Harold's pet fish dies) as it was too much for my son to understand and too much for me to stay dry-eyed due to the recent death of our dog!,1156982400,2,730,4.258992805755396
2119726,5,B0002TSZFQ,"My 2 1/2 year old started watching the Harold series on HBO-On-Demand. He was always asking us to watch them. This is an excellent series that shows children how to use their imagination. It is also very relaxing, and we often put it on at bedtime. As a result of watching Harold, our son has taken an interest in drawing and creativity. Harold is his hero! I have also noticed that his friends and cousins who watch Harold with him also seem to love it. It is an excellent, age appropriate video for toddlers and preschool age children.",1154476800,,537,4.489795918367347

considerably. I recommend this Dvd wholeheartedly.",1143244800,5,234,4.923076923076923

2119730,1,B0002TSZFQ,"The loneliness, sparkling wit and beautiful simplicity of the original Purple Crayon books (and the quite loyally adapted Gene Deitch animated cartoons - still available from Scholastic) are not to be found here, sacrificed to the treacly situations and inexplicable pastel colors of this confused, frustrating - and to this viewer at least - insulting ""interpretation."" It's as if Harold were aesthetically reincarnated as one of those hard sugar figurines manufactured for quick decoration of grocery store birthday cakes. I bought this believing that the Emmy bestowers would actually have some sense of taste when awarding their prizes, but in this case, I simply ended up tossing my set away. (I only am posting this as a warning to anyone who might be hoping to find some flavor of the original works in this adaptation; contemporary kids might like this on its own terms, which is ""the way things are"" -but this is not Crockett Johnson's ""Harold."")",1136073600,21,955,5.089171974522293

And I must say, I'm glad I bought the DVD. While the DVD set lacks in extras like games and stuff, it makes up for it with having the entire series available on it, and providing a nice little activity booklet. And hey, it's a good series: well written songs and very imaginative storylines. And Harold and Lilac are cute. I like it. I wish they'd put out a soundtrack for the show.",1134864000,,570,4.336448598130841

She sings along with the songs, dances, talks about items and characters from the series.... she could watch it for HOURS if we let her.  In fact, we got a portable DVD player and let Harold play in the car for the long Thanksgiving drive and never heard a complaint from the back seat.  When we played the series at our family destination, all the kids, ages one through 8, were entranced by Harold.  Great stories, great animation, great music.  Harold uses his imagination to both challenge himself and solve problems - all from the safety of his room.  A very empowering and enjoyable series of short stories for kids. And as another reviewer said, mom and dad kind of like it, too.",1103673600,3,751,4.445255474452555

The rhythm and tempo for that story are great and you will find it stuck in your head. All of the stories are very soothing if you're looking for an alternative to some of the ""amped up"" children's programming out there. No yelling or goofy voices, just nice smooth story telling.
