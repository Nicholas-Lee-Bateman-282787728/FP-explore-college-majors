7125504,5,B00W6OFI7I,The Blu Ray print really makes the movie enjoyable. The scenes of the devastation of Hiroshima are particularly good. The two leads are charismatic and the rapport between them comes across.,1446249600,2,190,5.161290322580645
7125505,3,B00W6OFI7I,"This risible film is the perfect embodiment of existential kitsch. The absolutely shocking element is that Resnais exploited the genuine tragedy of Hiroshima (using actual documentary footage! ) to frame a French woman's narcissist whine about the ""tragedy"" of losing her Nazi sex partner. Margarite Duras may have been ultimately responsible for the silly and pretentious narrative, but why a director of Resnais' talent chose to film it is beyond comprehension.

Despite fancy narrative stylistics, this is a truly embarrassing period piece and a nadir of ""leftist"" filmmaking.",1443830400,3,579,5.579545454545454

7125508,5,B00W6OFI7I,"I echo the superlatives concerning Alain Resnais's genius and the powerful impact - emotional, political, artistic - of this film of the two other reviewers on this page. A film like HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR is bound to gather a band of outsiders around it, devoted multiple viewers who can never close the book on such an experience in cinema. I first saw it at a moviehouse specializing in art films - the audience of mostly a college crowd was primed to appreciate what advance word had already enshrined as a major film. I had already read the screenplay published in a series of such art film screenplays published in paperback. My knowledge of the plot, my awareness of Duras's haunting words, my grasp of many still shots did not interfere with a sense of genesis - this is where cinema begins, what will come next? Well, what came next to that art house cinema was Truffaut's Antoine Doinel films, a definite step down from Resnais's transcendent seriousness. I was not ready to incorporate Truffaut's sense of style and charm in the same league as Resnais's intense vision. College kid, huh? I'm more flexible and inclusive now, but for several months the Resnais/Duras collaboration was a high point in my sense of the purpose and responsibility of artists to be moral as well as artistic leaders. I was gratified that my two recent viewings of the film revived and confirmed my youthful enthusiasm. Classic cinema, to paraphrase Mayakovsky, has no wrinkles. And in retrospect, Truffaut's vision of the Life of Common Experience is a necessary parallel to Resnais's vision of the Life of Extraordinary Experience.",1438819200,4,1618,4.908759124087592
7125509,5,B00W6OFI7I,"Hiroshima Mon Amour,"" directed by Alain Resnais, is a major film of the French New Wave movement. Elle (Emmanuelle Riva) is a French actress working on an anti-war movie on location in 1959 Hiroshima. She plays a nurse in the movie-within-the movie. On her final day in Japan, Elle engages in a brief, intense affair with married architect Lui (Eiji Okada). The two discuss Hiroshimas recent devastation from Americas atomic bomb attack that destroyed most of the city and left survivors mutilated and poisoned from radiation. Newsreel images graphically illustrate the effects of the bomb on civilians.

Resnais combines eroticism, history, and political commentary in a powerful comment on the convenient blindness to collateral damage that war inflicts. Both Elle and Lui (She and He in French) carry baggage from their wartime experiences, with the affair helping to heal two emotionally damaged individuals from different races. The film is a brutal condemnation of the attacks (there was a second bomb dropped on Nagasaki days after Hiroshima) that killed 250,000 Japanese citizens. Marguerite Duras screenplay deftly weaves past and present, personal pain and public suffering.

Blu-ray bonus extras include audio commentary by film historian Peter Cowie, interviews with Alain Resnais from 1961 and 1980, interviews with Emmanuelle Riva from 1959 and 2003, new interview with film scholar Francois Thomas, 2003 program about the films restoration, excerpts from a 1959 Cahiers du cinema roundtable discussion about the movie, and a booklet containing a critical essay.",1436659200,12,1576,5.481481481481482
7125510,5,B00W6OFI7I,"Director Alain Resnais produced a unique effect in his work. Every time I saw one of his films, I felt as if I had entered into a trance state during the whole of it. It always took me at least five minutes to come out of it after each movie ended. He was able to produce this hallucinatory effect right out of the gate with this, his first film. Of course, he had a writing heavyweight aboard which certainly made it possible. This was Marguerite Duras.

To set this film in Hiroshima, Japan in the 1960s was more daring than it would be today. It was ripe in everyone's mind that we had A-bombed Hiroshima in 1945 to end WWII. To then have a love affair take place in Hiroshima between a former Ally nation white woman and an Axis power male (Japanese), put an additional spin on their being ""mixed."" These two are obsessive and consuming in their affair. It as if the affair were a vehicle for conducting an exorcism of their personal pasts and the anguish of Hiroshima.

The film is shot in black and white which helps the trance effect of the film. French cinema had its ""New Wave"" period in the 1960s wherein one film after another was an adventure in a new styles of filmmaking. It was very artistic and intellectually stimulating. This film is considered a cornerstone of the entire movement.

Resnais would go on to make one excellent film after another and Duras to write one exquisite novel or screenplay after another. They were huge talents.",1434240000,10,1454,4.5
