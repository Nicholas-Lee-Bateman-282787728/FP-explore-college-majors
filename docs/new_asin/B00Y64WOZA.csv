8717550,5,B00Y64WOZA,"For some continuing puzzling reason, 3D movies like this one (which is very entertaining--don't listen to the professional critics) are not sold in the U.S. These movies are shown in 3D at the movie theatres here, but when the Blu-ray comes out, only the 2D version is available in the U.S. Disney is particularly bad about this. The studios explain that there is a limited market for 3D, blah, blah.--really! How big could the German-speaking market be, for example, where all of these 3D American movies are released on Blu-ray?

Anyway, I ordered the German release of this movie in 3D from Amazon UK, which is region-free. It played perfectly on my Region-A (U.S. & Canada) Blu-ray player, including the bonus disc. The Thai version listed here is way overpriced. I spent about $26 including shipping from Amazon UK.  If you have never ordered from an overseas branch of Amazon, it is quite easy. Your password and payment information are all automatically carried over. This German import was slightly cheaper from the UK than from Amazon-Germany, an exchange rate issue.

The 3D in this movie is quite good. Other than some German language on the disc's cover, there are no forced subtitles (there are, however, a number of subtitles available, including English) and the menus are in English.  Check out Amazon UK for this 3D movie.",1465689600,3,1339,4.911504424778761
