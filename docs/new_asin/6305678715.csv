1059969,3,6305678715,"Barring some gorgeous shots of San Francisco and a couple of stray good moments with Sean Connery, there really is very little in this movie that makes too much sense.

The washed-up theme of two partners forced to work together despite hating each other's guts is colored a little by tossing in another character to convolute affairs -- one partner's daughter. Who adds precious little to the theme at the end of it all. In fact, we don't even know what really happens to her after that baseless (no pun intended) bedroom sequence.

And if you mistakenly lead yourself to believe that this was simply an overdrawn soap, there's a ""gem"" of a secret plot that unravels just in time before the credits roll, leaving you with a simple question -- why was it necessary to involve bottled water at any moment in the execution of the criminal scheme?

An added bonus of skipping this utterly skippable movie may be that you will not have to ask yourself that question.",1091750400,3,962,4.647058823529412
1059970,3,6305678715,"Review of the Presidio starring Sean Connery and Mark Harmon.
This is a 2 star story with 5 star actors, so I rated it 3 stars.
The strength of this movie could be said to be that the characters played by Connery, the base commander and Harmon an X-MP under Connery and now cop were not very likeable.  The friction and emotional tension between these characters is the heart movie.  The murder mystery takes a back seat.  Another side issue in addition to the murder was the love interest of Connery's daughter, Meg Ryan for Harmon and her friction with her dad.
Another friction in the story is that of a military base located near the USA's Saddom and Gamorrah known as San Francisco.
The movie bogs down and drifts as the characters treat each other inordinately poorly, and in a manner not justified by what we know.  If the movie was based on a book that provided that information, it was not shared with the movie viewer.  A good cast is wasted here and this is a 2.5 movie rounded up to 3 for its stars.",1059350400,2,1011,4.385026737967914
1059971,5,6305678715,"I've seen this film about 20 times and I still love it. The terrific scenery of San Francisco is just one element of a ""thinking person's"" action film.  A movie with a brain. And, probably Meg Ryan's best performance on film. Mark Harmon and Connery are perfectly cast and the script is intelligent and fascinating. I love this movie.",1000425600,24,334,4.661016949152542
1059972,5,6305678715,"Pretty mundane stuff from director Peter Hyams as usual. Mark Harmon plays an obnoxious San Francisco police detective who investigates a murder that took place on local military base, and goes head to head with an old army bureaucrat, the presidio's chief provost, unconvincingly played by Sean Connery. Strictly Hyams' usual uninspired formula is at work here. It is still interesting to watch Connery in a role that he is totally miscast and see just how he approaches this character. Bruce Broughton's score is not bad.",970358400,3,523,5.093023255813954
1059973,3,6305678715,"Kind of cheesy, in an amusing, enjoyable way.  Only Meg Ryan, supposedly Connery's wild and dangerous daughter, is unwatchable in this movie.",947980800,4,141,5.409090909090909
1059974,1,6305678715,"I'm not sure why the reviewers who have raved about this film like it so much?  Who in the film are they rooting for?  Mark Harmon, who foolishly ignores his training and police rules resulting in a suspect being  needlessly killed and who attacks Meg Ryan's date, and not by Marquis of  Queens.  Meg Ryan, who acts sordidly because she wants to upset her father?  Or maybe Sean Connery, who gets to say a lot of foul things and beat  someone up?  Well, we've seen Connery beat villains up in better films.  It's hard to say who in this film is more inept - the heroes or the  villains.  I can see the bad guys racing away from the scene of the crime,  but once they are off the presidio, would they really draw attention to  themselves on the streets of San Francisco by speeding past cops, when all  they had to do was drive quietly down side streets at the speed limit to  make their getaway?  And how did the accomplice who ran over one of his  partners know exactly which street the victim would run down and when?  No,  Peter Hyams has made some good films in the past, but this is not one of  them.  Of course, if you like stupid chase films that make no sense, that  exploit every cliche in the book, and have stupid characters with  ridiculous motivations...",947289600,8,1267,4.32051282051282
1059975,4,6305678715,"I haven't seen this movie in about a year, but since nobody has reviewed this movie yet, I feel I owe it to this film to put in my two cents.
This is one of those movies I never get tired of watching.  A top notch  performance by Sean Connery as an overprotective military father to  rebellious wild child Meg Ryan.  Mark Harmon is also great as am  ex-military civilian police officer with an attitude and a score to settle  with the object of his investigation.  Harmon and Connery clash beautifully  as an underlying mutual respect begins to grow between them (although  neither of them will admit it).  Meg Ryan shines in both her conflicts with  her father and her romanting toying with Harmon.
The story's plot is  good, but nothing unique.  It is the characters that make this movie a  winner. Keep an eye out for the bar scene where Connery demonstrates how  his thumb can be used as an effective weapon.  It is one of my favorite  scenes in the film.  Definitely a satisfying movie and the DVD is displayed  prominently on my Christmas list this year.",944611200,6,1060,4.5132275132275135
1059976,5,6305678715,"This has got to be one of my wife and I's favorites. This is the Meg Ryan I remember from my college days. Not the sappy sweet angel from ""you've got mail"" but the forcefull, erotic bad girl. Yet the  Love scenes were handled tastefully and yet you are left with no doubt what  happned. I rate the sexual tension in this one right up there with  ""the Big Easy"". Oh and the overall plot is pretty good to.",943142400,2,404,4.0886075949367084
1060063,4,6305678715,"A couple of chase sequences with a bit of a plot tossed in.
Theres bad feelings between a tyrannical Provost Marshal (Sean Connery as Lt. Col. Caldwell) and a former MP (Mark Harmon) he had demoted.  That MP is now a SFPD inspector who needs to solve a murder on the colonels turf.  A certain amount of cooperation is required, neither is willing to give an inch.  To complicate matters, the cop starts dating the colonels daughter (Meg Ryan).
The plot suffers from a lack of focus as they attempt to keep things interesting on all fronts.  Unfortunately, solving the murder feels secondary, and it was potentially the most interesting aspect of this movie.  Instead, were given scenes where the two lead characters snap and snarl at each other while Meg Ryan wanders in and out of the story.

I like this movie slightly better because it features Sean Connery and Jack Warden.  Otherwise it is just another run-of-the-mill pseudo cop-buddy flick.",1506384000,,947,4.808641975308642

1060066,5,6305678715,Fantastic film. I loved every minute of it. I did notice though.... Mark Harmon when he was younger looks exactly like Tom Cruise now that he is older. I think I know who is going to be the lead agent on NCIS in 15 years.,1503878400,,221,3.933333333333333
1060067,5,6305678715,"I  liked watching The Presidio film for some of the following reasons; A strong storyline about a former military veteran and now San Francisco police officer named Jay Austin (Mark Harmon) who gets heavily involved with a complicated murder case that involves collaboration with his former commanding officer who is now Lt. Colonel Alan Caldwell (Sean Connery). To complicate matters even further, Austin is deeply in love with Caldwells daughter Donna Caldwell (Meg Ryan).

I have been a fan of hers since she was in the soap opera, Search for Tomorrow.  Sometimes its not acting in words, its her face.  She can be so expressive.  She has beauty, innocence and a composure that shines through even the worst script.

So, it starts off okay, with a car chase. And it ends okay, more action. In between, the murder investigation moves at a snail's pace, as the movie decides it's actually a romance. Don't get me wrong, I like romances, when done well (hint: don't have the characters just sit around and talk about their feelings).

GIRL: I like you, but I'm scared to get close.
GUY: Me too. Oh and by the way, your dad hates me.
DAD: I hate you. Many years ago, you beat up a guy who was drunk and disorderly, after he picked on your female police partner and then took a swing at you. I didn't even really like the guy. But still, I hate you.

1060169,2,6305678715,"A lot of people commented on the bad acting. All three leads are pretty good actors, of course. Sean Connery is awesome.

The direction however was absolutely horrible, which did not let any of the actors perform as they could have.

Many times people blame a bad performance purely on the actor, but trust me, being from the industry, a bad director can ruin a great actor's performance, and a good director can bring out greatness from an average actor.",1500422400,,455,4.675

1060171,3,6305678715,"For a movie with some big-name actors, The Presidio sure features some clunky acting. For example, see the scene in which Ross Maclure (Jack Warden) drops in on the bad guys (around 1:21 on the streaming version). It's stiff and hokey and makes you wonder whether you're watching a high school theatrical production. There are also scenes that seem to have little reason to exist, such as the one in which Alan Caldwell (Sean Connery) beats up the thug in the bar. As far as I can tell, it was there to portray Caldwell as a tough guy and to include some action, but it serves absolutely zero purpose as far as moving the film along. Otherwise, The Presidio adheres pretty closely to the standard buddy cop formula of earlier 1980's films (48 Hours, Beverly Hills Cop, Lethal Weapon, etc.). I'm tempted to give this movie a lower rating, but I have to admit that it kept me mildly interested, so three stars it is.",1499644800,,914,4.545454545454546

1061203,5,6305678715,"This movie is for those of us who grew up in San Francisco. For all others it may, indeed, be too simplistic, boring, etc. And it's OK, don't force it, just let it go and move on to something else. I, for one, like to watch this movie for the atmosphere, for the nostalgic feeling of being back home in 1980es San Fran, just as I remember it growing up. I enjoy a trip down the memory lane now and again. And the cast is great as far as I am concerned. The Connery/Ryan/Harmon trio just let the movie roll smoothly all the way to the end. So, if you are ""made and grown in SF"", grab a cup of whatever makes you feel good, relax and enjoy! :-)",1466294400,2,642,3.9844961240310077

A young fearless San Francisco detective is put on a case with the experienced US Army officer in charge of military police on the Presidio. There's animosity derived from the detective's service as an MP in the Presidio when he slugged an officer who was being arrested. Harmon and Connery are the main characters butting heads over who has presidence in this case. Throw in a slinky, slightly slutty colonel's daughter as a distraction for the SFPD cop, and father's nightmare some color is added. The aged Medal of Honor recipient who saved the, then shave tail lieutenant in Vietnam, and diamonds add enough twists and turns to make this enjoyable enough to watch twice. Don't miss the scene in the caf between the Screaming Eagle colonel and a loud mouth bully. You'll never look at a thumb in the same light again.",1465948800,,886,4.7973856209150325

The second disc was an audio CD containing four 1980s songs. That's it. There were no special features on this video at all.

1061780,5,6305678715,"This is a fast paced,  crackerjack  mystery with an impressive San Francisco backdrop that, nevertheless, has a few rough edges. Mark Harmon is police detective and former MP whose anti-army, anti-officer attitude is overdone. Sean Conner is a sharp, but by the book MP colonel whose alienation from the world is overdone and Meg Ryan is his out of control daughter who is a bit too overwrought. The poor marksmanship of the villains is remarkable. Still, this is a movie worth seeing and seeing again.",1438473600,3,502,4.894117647058824

Great scenes of a bygone rational San Francisco before its present frenetic congestion and overcrowded dilapidation. Sean Connery as balding Provost Marshall is a pleasure to watch, as is Jack Warden (see him in the original '12 Angry Men' with Henry Fonda) but Harmon is one-dimensional with his smug righteousness schtick, and Ryan incessantly flashes the mile wide smile that is (was?) the mainstay of her acting skills. The older actors are the pros, the scenery is of a San Francisco of yesteryear and the Harmon and Ryan characters feel as threadbare of spontaneity as the plot of an episode of NCIS.",1416873600,,788,5.022900763358779

1062409,4,6305678715,"The Presidio, directed by Peter Hyams (Timecop, Stay Tuned) introduces us to an unlikely pair of Military Police played by Sean Connery (Dr. No, Highlander) and Mark Harmon (Summer School, NCIS) who must solve a murder at the Presidio, an army base in San Francisco.

This review is just for the Blu-Ray and not the movie itself, though it does star Meg Ryan as well, before her terrible plastic surgery face.
The movie comes with a theatrical trailer for The Presidio... yeah, that's it. Pretty lame for a new Blu-Ray release.
The video quality is superb, superior black levels, film grain is visible, and there is no visible artificial sharpening. A solid and impressive transfer for a mostly ordinary suspense thriller nearly 25 years old. Being that there are basically no supplemental features, Warner/Paramount was able to compress it onto a BD-25 with an average bitrate of 23.95 Mbps.

Overall, this film is pretty predictable and formulaic but well done. It's shot exceptionally well as all of Peter Hyams films are, Mark Harmon and Sean Connery have a great chemistry and make for a good pair in this basic buddy cop film. For an older, mostly forgotten film, this is a solid Blu-Ray release. Unfortunately Warner/Paramount didn't feel the same way and included basically no supplemental materials. With the really great transfer, any fan of this film should upgrade from their 1999 DVD release, if the price is right.",1376870400,8,1428,4.97071129707113

1062499,3,6305678715,"""The Presidio"" is a really good movie.  Well, that would be if it were a made-for-TV film, which I'm assuming that it wasn't.

It's not the cast that's the problem.  Sean Connery is good, as usual.  And while I've been very hit-and-miss on Mark Harmon -- I hated his interpretation of Ted Bundy, and NCIS is absolutely unwatchable -- I think that he's pretty decent here.  Even Meg Ryan, who's been in quite a few completely overrated films -- ""You've Got Mail,"" anyone? -- doesn't completely stink here.

But rather, I believe that it was the screenplay.  Mr. Connery and Mr. Harmon have somewhat of a love-hate relationship here, for at least a couple of reasons.  One guy hooking up with another guy's daughter might be one of them.  And this little ""love triangle"" is what's blas for me; it seemed to be a cheap little plot device to try and bring some interest to the characters and their plights.

I decided to watch this film because it was on ""free"" TV, it was in HD, I'd never seen it before, and it was set in San Francisco.  I lived in the city for a year and a half, and I still live very close and visit fairly often.  I wanted to see what SF looked like in the 80s, and I guess not much has changed really; steep hills, narrow houses, lots of fog.  And lots of mediocre films still get made there I suppose.

Well, if you're really bored and you can watch this film for free, I'd perhaps give it a peek.  Just pretend that it's an Afterschool Special and maybe you won't be completely disappointed.",1365638400,,1512,4.369175627240144

1062771,3,6305678715,"1988's ""The Presidio"" paired veteran actor Sean Connery with a young Mark Harmon and a younger Meg Ryan in a rather mundane San Francisco murder mystery.  The movie was set at the U.S. Army's beautiful Presidio of San Francisco military base and in San Francisco itself.

Connery is Lieutenant Colonel Caldwell, the cantankerous, by-the-book Provost Marshal of the Presidio; Harmon is Jay Austin, forced out of the military by Caldwell and now a hot-headed San Francisco police detective.  When a military policeman is murdered during a break-in at the Presidio Officer's Club, the two must cooperate on the investigation.  Their difficult relationship is made more challenging by Austin's attraction to Caldwell's beautiful but rebellious daughter, played with aggressive gusto by Meg Ryan.

The murder investigation leads to a conspiracy with ties back to the Vietnam War, culminating in a violent shoot-out in a bottled water warehouse.  The plot will seem clumsy to audiences now savy on crime forensics; the even clumsier dialogue sometimes threatens to bury the movie altogether.

The movie has its redeeming features.  Connerly and Harmon manage to craft a little ""old bull, young bull"" buddy chemistry on screen.  A scene in which Caldwell impresses Austin by using a little hopkido to clean up a bar with a loud-mouthed drunk may be the highpoint of the movie.  The movie makes good use of its location shooting around the Presidio.

This movie is recommended as mild entertainment for fans of Sean Connery and Mark Harmon.",1203724800,20,1532,5.186991869918699

Mark Harmon plays an obnoxious San Francisco police detective who investigates a murder that took place on local military base, and goes head to head with an old army bureaucrat, the presidio's chief provost, unconvincingly played by Sean Connery. Strictly Hyams' usual uninspired formula is at work here. It is still interesting to watch Connery in a role that he is totally miscast and see just how he approaches this character. Mark Harmon gives a credible performance but his talents as an actor are once again left untapped this time by director Peter Hyams.
