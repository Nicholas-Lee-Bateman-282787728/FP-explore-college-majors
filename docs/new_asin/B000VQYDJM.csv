2946274,5,B000VQYDJM,Really enjoyed another DVD release of this show.  I think it's better than the other 2 Law & Order shows by a long shot.  Can't wait for them to release the other seasons.....,1198540800,,175,4.2727272727272725
2946275,5,B000VQYDJM,"For anyone who has seen the last 4 seasons of Law and Order: SVU, know what I mean when I say this is the last classic season of the show.
From season 6 and on, the show has dealt with, divorces, the ""will they or won't they"" quiestion of the Benson/Stabler romance, choosing partners over civilians, FBI agent and possible love interest of Benson, and more recently, baby drama.  They'll be little of that in the season 4 box set of SVU.  This season follows the protocol of seasons 1-3, which is very little character growth and little to no romantic moments between any of the characters, save episode 12, Risk, in which the characters go undercover and there is a few brief romantic moments between Benson/Stabler.
Now please, do not get me wrong, while this season contains the few elements of the recent episodes, this is still a wonderful season, filled with character driven plots, very memorable episodes, as well as little known gems.  Such as the one I mentioned above ""Risk""  One of the more famous SVU episodes in which the team deals with a drug dealer, and has every member go undercover.  Another memorable episode is ""Futility""  (Or  the episode commonly known among fans as 'the one where Fred Savage hits Olivia')  And another wonderful episode, and my first ever episode ever in the history of this show, is ""Damaged"" where a 16 year old sociopath and her sister are involved in a shootout, but the circumstances aren't as clear cut as it may seem.
All in all this is a wonderful season, one which I encourage any SVU fan to buy, and all family and friends of an SVU fanatic to buy seeing how this box set goes on sale December 4th, just in time for the Holidays.",1192579200,33,1683,4.549668874172186

2946298,5,B000VQYDJM,I am a late-comer to the Law & Order phenomenon.  I didn't get interested in the show until about six months ago and now I have made it through season 10. I love the plot lines and the characters on the show. I don't think you have to start with season 1 but I did find it helpful that I learned about Olivia and Elliot a lot in the first season. A part of me was worried that the plots would get redundant but they never do  Each episode has such a diverse range of supporting actors and actresses that they keep the show lively and entertaining. Definitely recommend buying the DVD series for people who have seen the series before and for those who have never seen it before.,1435276800,3,678,4.207692307692308

2946314,5,B000VQYDJM,SVU - the Best.,1410739200,,15,3.0
2946315,5,B000VQYDJM,"I love Law and Order: SVU and have been a fan for many years. The Special Victims Unit deals with crimes of rape, incest, and child abuse to name a few, topics that were often ignored on TV before this show came out and opened the forum for discussion on it. I also think it's empowering that the detectives in any rape case encourage the victims to come forward and get help because so many victims choose not to for various reasons. Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni (Benson and Stabler) bring such emotion to their characters and they are both phenomenal actors and have such chemistry together that you love them as a team. Even though this show has been on for many years, they still manage to bring new topics and ideas to the episodes. The show is so well written and riveting and you are hooked from the ""dunk dunk"" sound in the first segment. Every episode is amazing!

Some notable episodes are ""Damaged"" about a 5 year old girl who is fatally injured in a robbery but tests positive for STDs and the detectives turn their attention to the sister's boyfriend and ""Deception"" about a young child's family portrait drawing that leads to some questions about the mother's inappropriate relationship with her stepson after the father is murdered. You will not be disappointed!",1408406400,,1282,4.672566371681416

This is the first of the Law and Orders that I ordered that it did not have a cover sleeve. Discs are fine, but will have to find something to keep them all together. The 6 discs came in double cases (2 discs per case). Not a big deal, but for collections, it needs to be kept together. All of the reasons above are why I gave 4 stars.",1395792000,,501,4.175257731958763

2946332,5,B000VQYDJM,"Law and Order is a compelling drama which relies on great concepts and wonderful story telling to pull viewers into exceptional entertainment.  It is important to note that the supporting cast is top notch.  The characters adroitly portrayed by Florek, Belzer, Ice-T, BD Wong, Stephanie March, and Tamara Tunie, among others, may be the best ensemble characterizations in TV history.  For my money (Stephanie March) Alex Cabot was the best ADA of any of the Law and Order series. Munch (Belzer) was as glib, if not moreso, than L&O's Lenny Biscoe, Fin Tutuola (Ice-T) has no equivalent and is a multi-faceted character, Dr. George Huang (BD Wong) added a technical character who brought a sophistication to the show otherwise missing, Dr. Warner (Tunie) worked her way into a full cast role as a savvy and intelligent ME.  Cragen (Florek) is an outstanding police captain and uses a mix of toughness and compassion to deal with his department.  All in all, it often seems that the most interesting aspects of this fine show are the subplots and acting of the supporting cast.  Certainly, the lead detectives are not nearly as intricate and interesting as Bobby Goren on Law and Order:  Criminal Intent.  (Moreover, the chemistry between Goren and Eames, his very capable female partner, surpasses that of any other Law and Order lead detectives.)  It is the excellent and diverse characters of the supporting cast that make SVU an outstanding TV drama.",1374105600,3,1452,4.991701244813278

2946334,5,B000VQYDJM,"SVU is definitely the greatest series out of the law and order franchise. The writing is great, the acting is great, EVERYTHING  is great.

My mom and my sister agree.  He's the cutest kid in the whole series.  You'll want him to help put the bad man in jail!",1357084800,,275,4.0
2946344,5,B000VQYDJM,The early years were fun to watch because of the development in relationships and growth of the characters.  Highly recommend.,1355702400,,126,5.3
2946345,4,B000VQYDJM,"So I'm a pretty big fan of this series.  I like the characters, the search for justice, and the fact that there is hope for victims out there.  All these serve to make this particular flavor of Law & Order the only one I like, as I tend to avoid the original or Criminal Intent.  For those not familiar with Law and Order SVU, it deals with the tough crimes, rape, child abuse, and elder abuse.  And also, if you're not familiar with it, go start at the first season!

Season Four is of course the fourth year in the series.  There is somewhat of a timeline although some of the extended plots that go through the seasons are largely ignored in this season.  We don't get much of the detectives personal lives so there is no story arc there.  But each episode is its own complete story, and they serve ok on their own.

Season Four has twenty five episodes.  And not all of these episodes are all that great.  If fact, there were several that I fell asleep through as they just didn't keep my interest.  Now I have seen all of these before, so that could be part of the problem, but really, I haven't has as much trouble with that on the first three season.  I think that maybe these just weren't as interesting or imaginative and that the characters just weren't up to their usual stellar performances.  I did enjoy the Episode ""Tortured"" as it brought up some issues that happen in other countries and the difference between the USA and other governments on how they are handled.  Likewise, ""Angels"" was heartbreaking and had a very good child actor in it.  However, those episodes that put me to sleep were ""Appearances"" about the child pageant industry and ""Futility"".  They weren't bad episodes per say, but especially with Pageant, it felt a little contrived.

Characters:
Christopher Meloni: Elliot Stabler
Mariska Hargitay: Olivia Benson
Richard Belzer: John Munch
Ice-T: Fin Tutuola
Stephanie March: Alexandra Cabot
B.D. Wong: George Huang
Dan Florek: Captain Cragen

While Meloni and Hargitay were their usual brilliant selves, I have to say I was quite disappointed to see that Belzer and Ice-T featured only rarely in this season.  Ice-T more so than Belzer even, and that's not saying much.  I really enjoy the episodes with them in it but apparently they were busy, because they just weren't around too much.  And Meloni and Hargitay are good, but I do like to see a little variance here and there.  On a good note though, there was quite a bit of March and Wong in this season.  I like the added elements they give playing the ADA and psychiatrist as it gives yet another look at the crime and helps you to analyze different details of the case.  There are so many actors that play in this type of show that it really is nice to have a set cast that you can count on to be in almost every episode and it ties together the different seasons.

Still a very good show and while this may not be the most spectacular of seasons, it is still worth watching if you're a fan.  I'll be moving right along to the fifth season myself.

2946350,5,B000VQYDJM,"This is a great series and has remained so. This is an offshoot of the original Law and Order series. This series focuses on sexual crimes, normally not dealt with on television. The main crimes are rape, child molestation, and everything in between. I am very glad the Law and Order series decided to tackle this once taboo topic and I believe this series has helped open the discussion of rape and sexual abuse which is one of the reasons why I love this series so much.

The acting is great, the plots are amazing and draw in you from the first ""dum dum"". Since it deals with sensitive subject matter, the episodes may not be appropriate for all viewers. There is high replayability with these episodes which is why it is worth the purchase. If you enjoy crime dramas, especially crime dramas that help open debate and deal with taboo topics, then this is the show for you. I guarentee you will enjoy it.",1228867200,5,907,4.496969696969697
2946351,5,B000VQYDJM,I enjoy the show and am pleased that it is out on DVD. I think the show offers a unique perspective and asks open-ended questions. The DVD's are burned on both sides which reduces the amount of packaging and makes storage easier.,1216166400,,229,4.476190476190476

However, since the show is now on the 8th season, I am still loving it. It has always had more character development in it than the other Law and Order shows, which I am a fan of also...especially the original show. Dick Wolfe and company must see it working for SVU because in this season's new and revamped Law and Order, the original, people are learning more about the characters personal lifes.

I think knowing the personal things that they bring home from the office and how it affects their families is a great way to tie the shows together. I for one will very sorry when it goes off the air. But I will still have all the DVDs out there.",1201564800,,813,4.3841059602649

3180772,5,B000VQYDJM,"For anyone who has seen the last 4 seasons of Law and Order: SVU, know what I mean when I say this is the last classic season of the show.
From season 6 and on, the show has dealt with, divorces, the ""will they or won't they"" quiestion of the Benson/Stabler romance, choosing partners over civilians, FBI agent and possible love interest of Benson, and more recently, baby drama.  They'll be little of that in the season 4 box set of SVU.  This season follows the protocol of seasons 1-3, which is very little character growth and little to no romantic moments between any of the characters, save episode 12, Risk, in which the characters go undercover and there is a few brief romantic moments between Benson/Stabler.
Now please, do not get me wrong, while this season contains the few elements of the recent episodes, this is still a wonderful season, filled with character driven plots, very memorable episodes, as well as little known gems.  Such as the one I mentioned above ""Risk""  One of the more famous SVU episodes in which the team deals with a drug dealer, and has every member go undercover.  Another memorable episode is ""Futility""  (Or  the episode commonly known among fans as 'the one where Fred Savage hits Olivia')  And another wonderful episode, and my first ever episode ever in the history of this show, is ""Damaged"" where a 16 year old sociopath and her sister are involved in a shootout, but the circumstances aren't as clear cut as it may seem.
All in all this is a wonderful season, one which I encourage any SVU fan to buy, and all family and friends of an SVU fanatic to buy seeing how this box set goes on sale December 4th, just in time for the Holidays.",1192579200,33,1683,4.549668874172186

3180812,5,B000VQYDJM,"I love Law and Order: SVU and have been a fan for many years. The Special Victims Unit deals with crimes of rape, incest, and child abuse to name a few, topics that were often ignored on TV before this show came out and opened the forum for discussion on it. I also think it's empowering that the detectives in any rape case encourage the victims to come forward and get help because so many victims choose not to for various reasons. Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni (Benson and Stabler) bring such emotion to their characters and they are both phenomenal actors and have such chemistry together that you love them as a team. Even though this show has been on for many years, they still manage to bring new topics and ideas to the episodes. The show is so well written and riveting and you are hooked from the ""dunk dunk"" sound in the first segment. Every episode is amazing!

Some notable episodes are ""Damaged"" about a 5 year old girl who is fatally injured in a robbery but tests positive for STDs and the detectives turn their attention to the sister's boyfriend and ""Deception"" about a young child's family portrait drawing that leads to some questions about the mother's inappropriate relationship with her stepson after the father is murdered.

3180829,5,B000VQYDJM,"Law and Order is a compelling drama which relies on great concepts and wonderful story telling to pull viewers into exceptional entertainment.  It is important to note that the supporting cast is top notch.  The characters adroitly portrayed by Florek, Belzer, Ice-T, BD Wong, Stephanie March, and Tamara Tunie, among others, may be the best ensemble characterizations in TV history.  For my money (Stephanie March) Alex Cabot was the best ADA of any of the Law and Order series. Munch (Belzer) was as glib, if not moreso, than L&O's Lenny Biscoe, Fin Tutuola (Ice-T) has no equivalent and is a multi-faceted character, Dr. George Huang (BD Wong) added a technical character who brought a sophistication to the show otherwise missing, Dr. Warner (Tunie) worked her way into a full cast role as a savvy and intelligent ME.  Cragen (Florek) is an outstanding police captain and uses a mix of toughness and compassion to deal with his department.  All in all, it often seems that the most interesting aspects of this fine show are the subplots and acting of the supporting cast.  Certainly, the lead detectives are not nearly as intricate and interesting as Bobby Goren on Law and Order:  Criminal Intent.  (Moreover, the chemistry between Goren and Eames, his very capable female partner, surpasses that of any other Law and Order lead detectives.)  It is the excellent and diverse characters of the supporting cast that make SVU an outstanding TV drama.",1374105600,3,1452,4.991701244813278

3180841,5,B000VQYDJM,The early years were fun to watch because of the development in relationships and growth of the characters.  Highly recommend.,1355702400,,126,5.3
3180842,4,B000VQYDJM,"So I'm a pretty big fan of this series.  I like the characters, the search for justice, and the fact that there is hope for victims out there.  All these serve to make this particular flavor of Law & Order the only one I like, as I tend to avoid the original or Criminal Intent.  For those not familiar with Law and Order SVU, it deals with the tough crimes, rape, child abuse, and elder abuse.  And also, if you're not familiar with it, go start at the first season!

Season Four is of course the fourth year in the series.  There is somewhat of a timeline although some of the extended plots that go through the seasons are largely ignored in this season.  We don't get much of the detectives personal lives so there is no story arc there.  But each episode is its own complete story, and they serve ok on their own.

Season Four has twenty five episodes.  And not all of these episodes are all that great.  If fact, there were several that I fell asleep through as they just didn't keep my interest.  Now I have seen all of these before, so that could be part of the problem, but really, I haven't has as much trouble with that on the first three season.  I think that maybe these just weren't as interesting or imaginative and that the characters just weren't up to their usual stellar performances.  I did enjoy the Episode ""Tortured"" as it brought up some issues that happen in other countries and the difference between the USA and other governments on how they are handled.  Likewise, ""Angels"" was heartbreaking and had a very good child actor in it.  However, those episodes that put me to sleep were ""Appearances"" about the child pageant industry and ""Futility"".  They weren't bad episodes per say, but especially with Pageant, it felt a little contrived.

Characters:
Christopher Meloni: Elliot Stabler
Mariska Hargitay: Olivia Benson
Richard Belzer: John Munch
Ice-T: Fin Tutuola
Stephanie March: Alexandra Cabot
B.D. Wong: George Huang
Dan Florek: Captain Cragen

While Meloni and Hargitay were their usual brilliant selves, I have to say I was quite disappointed to see that Belzer and Ice-T featured only rarely in this season.  Ice-T more so than Belzer even, and that's not saying much.  I really enjoy the episodes with them in it but apparently they were busy, because they just weren't around too much.  And Meloni and Hargitay are good, but I do like to see a little variance here and there.  On a good note though, there was quite a bit of March and Wong in this season.  I like the added elements they give playing the ADA and psychiatrist as it gives yet another look at the crime and helps you to analyze different details of the case.  There are so many actors that play in this type of show that it really is nice to have a set cast that you can count on to be in almost every episode and it ties together the different seasons.

Still a very good show and while this may not be the most spectacular of seasons, it is still worth watching if you're a fan.  I'll be moving right along to the fifth season myself.

3180847,5,B000VQYDJM,"This is a great series and has remained so. This is an offshoot of the original Law and Order series. This series focuses on sexual crimes, normally not dealt with on television. The main crimes are rape, child molestation, and everything in between. I am very glad the Law and Order series decided to tackle this once taboo topic and I believe this series has helped open the discussion of rape and sexual abuse which is one of the reasons why I love this series so much.

The acting is great, the plots are amazing and draw in you from the first ""dum dum"". Since it deals with sensitive subject matter, the episodes may not be appropriate for all viewers. There is high replayability with these episodes which is why it is worth the purchase. If you enjoy crime dramas, especially crime dramas that help open debate and deal with taboo topics, then this is the show for you. I guarentee you will enjoy it.",1228867200,5,907,4.496969696969697
3180848,5,B000VQYDJM,I enjoy the show and am pleased that it is out on DVD. I think the show offers a unique perspective and asks open-ended questions. The DVD's are burned on both sides which reduces the amount of packaging and makes storage easier.,1216166400,,229,4.476190476190476
3180849,5,B000VQYDJM,I love the show Law and Order SVU and wanted the DVD's badly but was uncertain of what quality I would get. The DVD's are superb! Thank you,1215648000,,139,4.0
3180850,5,B000VQYDJM,"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit -The Fourth Year is the best season of this much-loved show. Some of my favorite episodes include: Chameleon, Angels, Damaged, Pandora, and Perfect. If there's one season of SVU to buy, then this is the season for you, you won't regret it!",1213056000,,273,4.708333333333333
3180851,5,B000VQYDJM,"I have the entire series.  I started watching this program when they first came out on TV.  The writing is great and so is the acting.  They change scenes and keep everything interesting and moving.  Try it--You'll like the suspense.

3180853,5,B000VQYDJM,"I disagree with those that say this was the last good season before it went down hill. This is a great season full of interesting storylines and unbelievable crimes.
However, since the show is now on the 8th season, I am still loving it. It has always had more character development in it than the other Law and Order shows, which I am a fan of also...especially the original show. Dick Wolfe and company must see it working for SVU because in this season's new and revamped Law and Order, the original, people are learning more about the characters personal lifes.

I think knowing the personal things that they bring home from the office and how it affects their families is a great way to tie the shows together. I for one will very sorry when it goes off the air. But I will still have all the DVDs out there.",1201564800,,813,4.3841059602649

3180855,5,B000VQYDJM,"This is one of the great seasons of SVU! Remember the good old times before it all went downhill? When the writing was still focused and superb, the drama was in the cases, nobody's wardrobe made you laugh, and smart-is-sexy Alex Cabot was the ADA? These DVDs bring them back - at their best. Featuring such much-beloved episodes as ""Fallacy,"" this DVD-box is a must for any SVU fan, and anyone wanting to meet the coolest member of the ""law and order""-family, before it lost its heart and mind.",1199750400,8,495,4.573033707865169

SVU is my particular favorite as the cast is incredible, believable and have wonderful chemistry.  I live in Alaska where I do not get TV so I'm always thrilled when a new one is released.

3180860,5,B000VQYDJM,"Another great season of SVU! This season grabs you from the first show. I've watched them over and over. I wish they had released them in order though. In the previous release the DA gets put in witness protection and a new DA, a.k.a. Dian Neal, is introduced. This season happens before this event. If your a fan like me and can watch them over and over it's worth the money.",1198972800,,376,4.309859154929577
