6444614,5,B00KRGYE2M,"My daughter fell in love with Bo on the Go around 9 months old! She loves the show because Bo, Dezi, and Wizard talk to her almost the entire episode! My daughter is now a year old and she will watch multiple episodes at once,  making it possible to get work done. I was thrilled to find this show on DVD! Long car rides should go much better with Bo along! My 5 year old daughter loves it too and gets up to move with Bo! I highly recommend this for babies and big kids!!",1423958400,,472,3.968421052631579

6444620,5,B00KRGYE2M,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter absolutely loves Bo on the Go she will watch and at least five shows in a row acting out with Bo every time. She asks for it all the time. She started watching it when she was 16 months and she actively recruited and still recruits anyone around when it is on to be Bo Buddies she even got her Dr to be a Bo Buddy at one of her check ups. I love it too because it gets her up and moving instead of just sitting there staring at the tv and being lazy. It's great for rainy and cold days where she can't go outside, but I have to hide it from her on sick days because she is an avid Bo Buddy and as she reminds me, ""Bo Buddies help Bo."" The only issue I have is I wish they had more episodes and movies for a little more variety. She is also getting into Tree Fu Tom for older kids and trying to do Tree Fu with Tom This is for like 2-4 while Tree Fu Tom is like 5-8. These are not the same ones that are on Netflix. If you are wanting the ones on Netflix you are looking at the 26 episode Volume One.",1410652800,2,1026,3.7327188940092166

She loves to do all the movements with Bo and Dezzy its fun watching her try to figure out how to move different ways.

6444628,4,B00KRGYE2M,"There's a problem! GET THE WIZARD!!!! Wizard, I have a... wow, you're really smart. How did you already know what was wrong? Oh, THAT'S who I need to find? Okay!

Find the 1st door. Run to it! Run like the wind! Oh... It's locked... wait THERE'S the key! Jump and get it!

Wow this place is weird, and has some weird things in it that won't let me get to that other door over there that I see. What should we do? Oh! Act like an animal! That worked! YAY! Let's dance! Oh no, the door is locked again... Wait THERE'S the key! Jump and get it!

Repeat the previous step twice? Okay, will do. Hey, this strange creature gave me something! Let's hold on to it for a while. Hey the last door is unlocked! Let's go look at the guy that's causing us so much grief!

Oh look he's having fun! We have to stop him though, so let's give him this incredibly convenient item we got earlier. The day is saved! LET'S DANCE AGAIN! DANCE WITH THE WIZARD!

MAXIMUM BO POWER!

In all seriousness though, this series is great. My 2-year old daughter loves watching it, and is learning how to exercise in a small space (living room) while enjoying her time. Coupled with the Volume 1 set, the ability to have her watch different episodes rather than the same one increases pretty significantly, as I have over 20 hours of non-repetitive screen time for her to jump along with.",1433116800,,1355,4.335968379446641

8661046,5,B00KRGYE2M,"As with all the Bo on the go programs, excellent for getting our 3 yr old up and moving while learning. We received this DVD quickly from the seller, which was perfect timing, as the only season of Bo on Netflix was being removed on April 2nd. Our toddler has loved Bo for over a year now, and knows all the animoves needed, so she is happy and stays entertained for long periods of time.
