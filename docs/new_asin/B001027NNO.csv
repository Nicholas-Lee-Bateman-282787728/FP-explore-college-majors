8671116,3,B001027NNO,"The main reason I rated this a 3-star is not for the quality of the video, which for those days was mostly 8MM film. My rating was based on the title Dau Tieng Base Camp. Most of the film centers around the 1st Division which operated in this area in 1965-66. The ONLY part of the Dau Tieng base camp that existed then was the airstrip and a number of French built buildings that was part of the Michelin Rubber Plantation. The 25th Division built the actual base camp and it was really the 3rd Brigade 4th Division element that was operationally controlled by the 25th Division, that was given the order to build the base under Operation Fort Nisqually. The 3/22nd and 2/12th Infantry along with the 2/22nd Mechanized Infantry did the actual construction starting in November 1966 and continued on into January 1967. They constructed all the buildings that housed the troops. In August, 1967, the 4th Div and 25th Div reflagged their respective 3rd brigades and the troops located in Dau Tieng became part of the 25th Division. I was a member of the 2/12th Inf from March 68 to Mar 69. Most of this film is about the 1st Division operated around that area. Their main roll was to clear the area of hostiles prior to the 3rd Bde arriving so they would have the freedom to concentrate on the actual construction activities.",1426809600,2,1322,4.582278481012659
