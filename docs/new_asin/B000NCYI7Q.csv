8176674,5,B000NCYI7Q,"I've seen the show, very nice and educational in addition to being entertaining. Falun Gong is deeply rooted in ancient Chinese culture, it is nothing wrong having Falun Gong related contents in a Chinese traditional celebration. It is similar to president Bush saying God bless America in an open speech.

The show is to tour 60 some cities in different continents in coming year. I've hear high praises about it. In fact, I've seen audiences in tears in theater.",1196726400,,464,4.8734177215189876
8176675,5,B000NCYI7Q,"I do not understand why the previous viewer gave such a bad comment. The show was great! As mainland Chinese most of shows we watched in China are deeply polluted by Chinese Communist Party full of songs and dances praising the government and all the art forms in mainland China more or less serve a purpose of government propaganda. The Chinese New Year Shows by NTDTV brought people the genuine Chinese culture not affected by Chinese Communist Party and reflected the essence of Chinese culture. The first program on the DVD was beautiful lion and dragon dance, followed by Tang Dynasty drum with dancers in elegant yellow ancient Chinese dress. There was also a dance called ""Fairy Flute"", with dancers dressed as elegant heavenly beauties and play flutes. The whole background was animated and look like real Chinese brush painting. There was also dances with theme ""Plum Flower"", the favorite flower by Chinese people because they bloom in the winter snow which reflects the kind of charactor Chinese people appreciate very much, that they do not give in to the hardship but grow stronger from them. I also saw the dance about Falun Gong practitioners. It reflected current situation in China with terrible human rights abuses. Innocent people who practitice Falun Gong (a kind of meditation system based on the principle of ""Truth-Compasson-Tolerance"" are killed because of their belief (which was regarded as independent thinking by Chinese government and got cracked down since 1999 because over 100 million Chinese practice it). The dance described an orphaned little girl (whose mother, a Falun Gong practitioner was killed) had a dream and saw her mother became a heavenly beauty and danced with other gods in the heaven. It was a beautiful and touching dance. I really liked it and I believe that half of people in the whole theatre were in tears while watching the dance. These are all traditional Chinese values and we cherish them very much. As a Chinese, I was very proud of my culture after watching the show. Chinese culture is elegant, classic, and spiritual. The show will change your past notions about Chinese culture, and really appreciate the history and charactors of Chinese people.",1173052800,,2209,5.021798365122616
8176676,1,B000NCYI7Q,"My mom attended this show is Boston, and my friend attended this show as a gift from her mom in Washington D.C., and it turned out that every song was about Falun Gong, which has nothing to do with Chinese New Years.  Many people were confused and some people walked out of the show.  Some skits were completely offensive and showed a Falun Gong practitioner being beaten to death on stage by ""evil communists.""  It is pathetic and reflects poorly on the American public that it has gained access to respectable venues such as RadioCity.",1172793600,2,537,4.631578947368421
