But all in all, it's cheaper buying them together and if you don't know the weapon, it will provide good information in learning how to use them.",1212624000,,382,4.121621621621622
8509221,4,B0000AE8UJ,"Two videos on bo.  Each video includs basics, a traditional Okinawan Shorinryu Kobudo kata and pre-arranged drills of the ISKKF.  The pre-arranged drills & sequences of kumite are against a bo.  There are other kata I wish could be included in the series, as well as the further bo vs bo kumite sequences.  Though it seems complete, the sequences are only dne up to #4, with mention of a 5 & 6 not shown.  I hope there will someday be a Bo volume III, maybe with the rare Chatayara no kon kata.  I like the bo kata very much on the current 2 bo videos; Sunakake no Kon, Chikin Bo & their version of Sakugawa No Kon Sho.  Nitanbo are an Okinawan version of what is called Arnis & escrima in the Philippines, but doen with hard-wood sticks, rather than with rattan sticks. The only flaw is the missing Kumibo 5 & 6 on the bo videos, unless the bo vs other weapons kumite are considered the continuation.  If so, it was unclear on the bo videos, thus the only flaw.  I hope for a future 3rd bo video in this series, though I suspect future tapes would be focusing on yet other traditional Okinawan weapons, of which there are many. Otherwise, an excellent series on Okinawan Kobudo for any interested in traditional Okinawan weapons.",1064880000,,1230,4.431111111111111
