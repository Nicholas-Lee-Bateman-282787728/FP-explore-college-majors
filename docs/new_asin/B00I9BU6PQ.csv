8640050,3,B00I9BU6PQ,"Overall, it was OK. The social interaction was a little stretched. It is a comedy.  I liked Brother Rat better.",1416787200,,111,4.55
8640051,5,B00I9BU6PQ,"Just love the old movies of the thirty's and forty's...pictures from the past depicting the culture of the time including life values and morals.  No bad language!  No revealing sex scenes! and most of all limited violence!
Brother Rat and Baby was the sequel to Brother Rat. Would advise watching the first movie, Brother Rat.  The local is the Virginia Military Academy (the West Point of the South!) when it was important that the country provide a strong youth that were skilled in leadership and ethical standards.  Eddie Albert is a delight, wonderful to see the future president, Ronald Regan, Jane Wyman was a joy to watch and there are no words to describe the beauty and acting of Priscilla Lane  You have to be a fan of the genre, but if you are, you will love it.",1402099200,2,775,4.586956521739131
