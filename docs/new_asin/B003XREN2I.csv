8609074,2,B003XREN2I,"I really feel that those involved had very good intentions when producing this dvd, however there are some fundamental flaws with this product. Primarily, the delivering of the production quality is quite low in its excessive use of graphics and extremely poor sound editing. If we, as parents, are seeking a calm and centered experience for our children (especially children with special needs) than  the poorly mixed audio and the overabundance of animated graphics has to be avoided.
Also, the instructor needs to pace her cues and model centeredness if this is to be more effective.
The instructors words are sincere and much appreciated and I really wanted this dvd to be a success. I hope they produce a sequel that will address these issues.
Peace.",1320969600,,755,4.992063492063492
