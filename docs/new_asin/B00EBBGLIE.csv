5901092,1,B00EBBGLIE,"I always enjoyed the original Killer Shrews, first as a child (where I viewed it on our local Satuday afternoon horror show in the 70's) and then years later as an adult . The bad fx (hand puppets and ""happy"" dogs in shrew costumes) work because all the actors in the movie take it so seriously . Return of the Killer Shrews has even worse fx but does not take itself seriously. James Best does not look, sound, or even act like the character he played all those years ago . I was very disapointed .",1390003200,4,499,4.208333333333333
5901093,1,B00EBBGLIE,"Here are my initial thoughts on this modern sequel to the 1959 cult classic, with a brief preface of my feelings regarding the original.

Granted, 1959's ""The Killer Shrews"" isn't exactly Lawrence Olivier's Hamlet, but given its intentions (to turn a quick buck) and budget ($120,000 +/-), it is a competently made, entertaining little monster movie. For me, THE KILLER SHREWS really only has a couple of major flaws, the most notorious being the ""shrews"" themselves. Yes, they're obviously a pack of dogs with hair extension wigs and some body make up, but given the limited F/X budget, the film makers did a decent job. The made-up dogs used in long shot, combined with the articulated shrew puppet heads used in close-ups make the shrew monsters fairly effective. They serve their purpose IF you can suspend disbelief and are willing to accept the F/X limitations of a B-grade film for what they are.

The other stumbling block is that Baruch Lumet & Ingrid Goude have fairly thick accents, especially Lumet. This can make it difficult to understand all of what's being said, and the fact that these two characters, Lumet's Dr. Marlowe Cragis character in particular, have a LOT of exposition to deliver can make for a pretty tough movie-going experience. Granted, the script resorts to the usual silly pseudo-science to rationalize the preposterous goings on and has its share of clunky dialog, but for the most part it's actually intelligent and well-written, and the film offers some genuine tension and manages a few very effective visual jolts.

Even though the Captain Thorne Sherman character is thinly sketched, James Best plays the part serious, turning in a solid performance. Thorne Sherman is a no-nonsense self-made man who takes crap from no one, and he is every bit as clever as he is tough. Ken Curtis makes his Jerry Farrell a wonderfully whiny drunken coward. The other actors (Gordon McLendon, Henry Dupree and Alfred DeSoto) do the best with their smaller parts, but ouch! those accents can really make the dialog tough to understand if you haven't seen the film several times, as I have over the years. The film is played straight which, for me, makes it easier to take than if the cast had hammed it up.

Now finally comes this sequel ...some 50+ years later.  (WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!)

Really? After 5 decades, THIS is the best they could do? The movie starts out nicely enough, recreating the font & look of the original film's opening titles. We then get a flashback/nightmare sequence showing us newly-shot footage re-imagining the death scene of ""Rook"" the 1st mate character from the '59 film. This new actor vaguely resembles the original, but his dialog (and delivery of that dialog) has been changed quite a bit. I always thought that Harold Rook hailed from the New Orleans area and that he simply had a thick southern accent. I never considered his line delivery as a ""fo' sho'"" Steppin Fetchit-esque racist performance, but what do I know? I am guessing that the new film's creative team likely opted to eliminate his accent & modernize his lines to avoid any potential ""racist"" labeling. I never thought negatively of Rook, nor was he in any way portrayed as a simpleton or a comedy-relief type. He was Throne's reliable 1st mate & best friend, a skilled mechanic who keep that old charter boat's engines purring like a kitten. In another odd script choice the new intro chooses to re-work Rook's death so that he no longer defends himself with a pistol during the attack; he's simply jumped by the shrews and dies. Weird.

More importantly, (and in what is a totally baffling character shift), Thorne Sherman is no longer a leathery, sea-toughened man of action. For the majority of the new film's running time Sherman stumbles around acting like a clueless, money-hungry buffoon. James Best and/or director Steve Latrshaw foolishly chose to jettison the original concept of the Capt. Sherman character and instead opted for a re-tread of his bumbling, dim-witted Roscoe P. Coltrane act from ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" TV series. What a shame. There's even a scene where ""Hazzard"" alumni John Schneider, Rick Hurst and James Best are standing around a Tiki bar constructed in the middle of the woods (huh?) and they get all cutesy-cute with the ""Don't I know you from somewhere?"" dialogue. Best's Thorne even stoops to claiming that he used to be a sheriff in Georgia, about 30 years ago, chasin' moonshiners! (Get it?!? Nudge-nudge, wink-wink, hardy har-har. *SIGH*)

What's particularly sad about this choice is that there's a quiet scene later in the film where Capt. Sherman discusses his first encounter with the shrews back in '59, confessing that he still has recurring nightmares about the experience, even all these years later. He feels he basically condemned Rook to death by not insisting that he accompany them all back to the island lab/compound as soon as their boat docked. James Best does a really wonderful job here, keeping the scene very real and low-key. He even tears up and his voice falters, cracking with emotion. It's a sincere, emotional piece of acting ...and in HUGE contrast to his performance throughout the rest of the picture.

The other actors? Just gawd AWFUL. The sole exception being Jason-Shane Scott. His performance is the most grounded and understated, allowing him to come off looking far more professional than the rest of the (mostly young) cast. The others give textbook examples of over-acting; running around mugging and camping their performances up, apparently thinking that it's all great fun because Hey! the original was stupid crap, right? So overacting just makes this new film as equally dumb & funny too, right? WRONG! The actors are PAINFUL to watch. I literally had to force myself to sit and finish this steaming pile and almost failed several times, especially during the first act. The first few scenes are so unbelievably stupid that I literally sat there shaking my head in stunned disbelief. Was this script written by a bunch of first graders? Was everyone drunk and/or stoned? The overall acting quality is on the level of a elementary school Thanksgiving pageant. Bruce Davison chews more scenery than the shrews, but his character is written that way so I honestly can't fault the man. The three veteran actors (Best, Hurst & Schneider), however, should all have known better. I can only guess that the director told everybody to go as far off the deep end as possible because what they were making was instantly going to become a beloved Cult Classic. Talk about a total disconnect between intent and result. Seriously... how could ANYONE watching the dailies during the filming of this turd have thought for even one second that what they were making was competent (or even coherent), let alone any good? This thing isn't even fun to watch on a ""so-bad-it's-good"" level.

The script is an insulting, thoughtless mess that stupidly takes HUGE liberties with the '59 film: changing and/or ignoring original events simply for the sake of convenience. Most notably, Jerry Farrell has somehow survived the shrew attack that took place at the end of the original picture! The sequel indicates that he was last seen up on the compound rooftop and was never actually attacked, even though we clearly saw him ripped to pieces in the '59 film. The Sherman character also strangely miss-quotes one of the most famous lines from the original. Here he states that the shrews must eat 10 times their body weight every 24 hours or starve, while in the original film the ratio is 3 times their body weight every 24 hours - a far more believable number. Am I nitpicking? I suppose so, but for cryin' out loud if you're gonna do a sequel then at least be more than just vaguely familiar with the source material. And just as important, be RESPECTFUL! Don't spit on what came before.

For reasons left unexplained, Jerry has chosen to live in a dank cave for the last 50 years even though the house/lab compound is apparently in perfectly good shape, which is admittedly pretty damned odd since no one has lived in it for over 50 years and by all rights it should have fallen into total disrepair and collapsed in on itself. And while I'm at it, there hasn't been much in the way of food supplies (except some WWII era army rations according to Jerry), but he looks just fine. In fact, the man's not only healthy, he's fat! Jerry's clothes are clean and in excellent condition too, showing zero signs of wear & tear after almost five decades!?! WTF? AND he's also perfectly clean-shaven! Uhh... where'd ya get them there razors, Jerry? But hey, don't worry about it folks! I mean, it's just a movie, right? Ugh. Next point: no explanation is given as to why the shrews are now shown running about in broad daylight, when they previously only foraged in the dark of night unless starving. Stranger still, the major plot point of the shrews being deadly poisonous in the '59 film has been dropped. Finally, the eerie, chattering shrew vocalizations used in the original film have been replaced here with a more traditional (and therefore decidedly boring) canine howling/keening. Very, very lame.

Now, as for the shrew F/X themselves, they are unbelievably poor. The shrew footage for this sequel is CGI, with the exception of a handful of shots using mock-up puppet heads that somehow actually manage to be even LESS convincing then the ones used in 1959! The CGI we are tortured with is just ghastly beyond belief. The shrews and blood & gore shots look like they were generated on an old Commodore 64. I can only guess that the creative team must have thought that this would be acceptable because the original film's F/X were so primitive. Again, the thought of the director & producers must have been ""The original F/X were crap, so if these look bad they''ll be a clever and FUNNY homage! Haw-haw-haw!"" NOT. Hey, I'm all for cheesy movies and stuff that's so-bad-its-funny. PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS, INDESTRUCTIBLE MAN and several other films have long been guilty pleasures of mine for decades, and they're rightfully considered camp classics; enjoyable films despite (or because of) their faults. Sadly, this sequel is none of that. It's simply wretched - in every respect. Shame on the filmmakers that foisted this putrid travesty on fans of the original. After gagging on this cinematic cowpie of a movie, I seriously contemplated trying to return it for a refund. But even if I got my money back I could never get back the 90 minutes of my life that were flushed away.

The ONLY bright spot in this disappointing mess of a movie was a brief flashback sequence utilizing footage from the original film that had been remastered in HD. Wow! It would be awesome to see the complete '59 looking film this good! The parties responsible for backing this inept garbage would've been far better served if they'd financed a complete frame-by-frame digital restoration of the 1959 motion picture and released THAT onto Blu-ray instead of bankrolling this insulting celluloid dungheap. Oh, well, one can dream.

Perhaps the worst part of all this was that during the end credits crawl they threatened a follow-up sequel entitled ""Revenge of the Killer Shrews."" God, please no. Just... NO!!  Thankfully, with James Best's recent passing, it's unlikely that we'll ever be assaulted with further KILLER SHREW-related sequels from this mentally arthritic director and his clueless crew of untalented taints.",1387497600,14,11513,4.8999486916367365

5901100,5,B00EBBGLIE,"In 1959, in the movie The Killer Shrews, boat captain Thorne Sherman (James Best) took a load of supplies to a group of scientists engaged in crazy 50's style scientific research on an island off the coast of Texas. The result of those experiments - normally thumb sized rodents called killer shrews grown to the size of knee high dogs! The beasties - ravenously hungry and vicious beyond imagining - kill nearly everyone. The last remaining scientist - Jerry Farrell - stays on the island and the shrews chase him down as Thorne and a couple of others make a daring escape attempt.

Now, it's fifty years later, and Thorne Sherman has unwillingly returned to that island, this time delivering a load of supplies to a crew of a outdoor survival reality show. Along with him this time is his trusty first mate Harold (Rick Hurst). The show turns out to be a low-rent affair starring Johnny Reno (John Schneider), a typically overblown Hollywood star. But the cast and crew have something far worse than an actor's ego to deal with on this island. First, the production interns disappear, then more of the cast and crew go missing. Jerry Farrell - still very much alive - is still on the island, and the intervening years have not been kind to his sanity. As the production crew continues to work on the TV show - there are strange noises out in the woods. Thorne Sherman has heard those noises before. Fifty years before - on this very island. The Killer Shrews have returned - and this time no one may survive!

Building on a cast featuring three actors from The Dukes of Hazzard and with the feel of a classic drive-in flick, this production manages to respect the original movie, offer up some fun and knowing performances and monster movie thrills, and best of all - do it all with a real sense of humor. Everybody plays it seriously in the attack scenes, and with a wink the rest of the time - and there are in-jokes and references to a lot of these actors and their previous associations that couldn't be more welcome to me. (I'm also not going to spoil even one of them.)

The standouts in the cast are of course the three Dukes vets and Bruce Davison - but don't count the other actors out - everybody has some good moments, especially Jennifer Lyons, Sean Flynn (grandson of Errol) and Jeneta St. Clair, and while some of the smaller roles feature less polished actors nobody is less than adequate.

The locations are gorgeous, the cinematography crisp and colorful, and credit must also go to the production design team - as they recreate the interior of the house on the island to a T. Considering the budget and schedule here, no department is slouching - and I give kudos to all of them for providing some solid production value onscreen. Everything has been marshaled to the screen by director Steve Latshaw with a real sense of engagement - he seems to have had a good time directing this movie - and that is some real production value - because it's passed on directly to the audience.

The 1959 movie catches hell in pretty much every review that its effects are shoddy - with dogs in costumes in the wide shots and puppets in closeup - but I will forever state for the record that until they show everything a bit too much in the climactic scenes those effects are pretty danged good. Expect some reviews to complain about the new effects too - as the costumed dogs have been replaced by CGI Killer Shrews with a new animatronic puppet for some closeup work. But the design of the creatures is terrific - and the effects work for the movie. So as Sheriff Rosco - aka James Best - might say: ""Hush!""

Basically, if you like cool old movies like The Killer Shrews or newer movies like DinoShark, you'll find a lot to love in this old fashioned creature feature. However, if the only value you find in these movies is to point out their low budget issues while being snarky and hipster about them - move along, there's nothing for you here.",1382918400,17,3954,4.530812324929972

5901104,1,B00EBBGLIE,"I am a huge fan of the original 'The Killer Shrews', and couldn't wait to see the sequel when I heard it was in production. 'Return of the Killer Shrews' is a big letdown. The whole film is taken as a big joke, with a precious few moments of decent acting from James Best.
One of the often debated original film were the monsters. The 1959 shrews were created by covering dogs with monster suits. Some joke about it. It terrifies me. They move like real animals, fight with each other, jump at fences and mob fallen victims. No shrew suits ever fell off, and the dogs could move naturally & perform unhindered by their makeup.
The CGI shrews in the sequel are in every way worse! They make CG effects in SyFy Channel films look like 'Avatar'. This movie lacks everything that made the original such a cult classic. My advice is to stay away from 'Return of the Killer Shrews' and treat yourself to the high-quality DVD from Genius Entertainment.

5901106,4,B00EBBGLIE,"The film is a sequel of the 1959 film few of us have seen and fewer remember. James Best of the original 1959 cast returns to the island to shoot a reality TV series. He is reunited with John Schneider and Rick Hurst of the Dukes of Hazzard. There are several  references to the popular series.

The shrews are CG and not very good CG. They are inferior to the 1959 dogs in drag which doubled as the shrews. The sound track is done in the style of older films, and includes beach music. It is SYFy/ Asylum quality and is for lovers of bad campy films.

5901107,1,B00EBBGLIE,"Another nearly plot-less, talent-less, insipid romp through nowhere with James Best returning to the Island of the Killer Shrews. The original 50s drive in classic is a text book example of cast and crew spinning gold out of straw with movie magic. Like The Giant Leaches and Invasion of the Saucer Men, the original Killer Shrews still brings a chill and a chuckle. Long time collectors hunted that title on VHS back in the 80s along with Night Of the Living Dead and King Kong, keeping the Killer Shrews alive and well to generations of ""cult"" movie fans.
  A sequel was a natural extension to this pre-sold  title. Sadly, it holds none of the charm or wit of the original. The quick buck mentality of this whole project shows through every aspect of the final film. Once again, inept comedy was the card played through out the running time. They call it ""camp"" and the only thing missing was the colorful POW and ZAP signs used to break up the sluggish, ill staged violence and gore.  It was probably a comfortable, undemanding shoot for cast and crew. The shrews and the havoc they did were all accomplished with extremely low grade CGI, looking like a bad 90s video game. No one in the woods actually had to deal with any of those cumbersome, long toothed puppets or ratty dogs for this outing. These shrews are flat like cardboard and look like they were literally stuck into the frame like some wiggly poster. But they don't look that realistic. The blood and cartoon-ish gore was all done in the computer as well. So the viewer, (the costumer, the only real victim in this horror) is left nothing to remember but that empty feeling of being robbed again.
  What amazes me more than anything about these movies is that there is a real opportunity here to upgrade the film with minimal effort. Why not actually DO the movie that is advertised on the cover?  I bought this DVD looking for THAT movie!  Take it from me, yawl,If you are looking for a wild new trip to that weird old place, Forget this one.  Nobody is there.",1405555200,3,2027,4.5467032967032965
5901108,3,B00EBBGLIE,"What these new filmmakers failed to realize when they set about making a sequel/spoof of the original Killer Shrews was the simple fact that the original was not meant to be funny, it just was.  These hacks, on the other hand, set out to make a comedy of it.  There's a huge difference between horrible dialog that is unintentionally funny, and dopey dialog that is meant to be a-yuck-a-minute but isn't because it strains too hard to be funny.  Just because the cast looks as if they had fun making this travesty doesn't mean the viewers will appreciate it in the same fashion.  It's a case of ""you had to be there"" to get it.
As for the plot, it's basically the same.  James Best (now well into his 80s), returns to THE island in a boat with an old colleague (this joke only works if you have ever watched The Dukes of Hazzard, I didn't).  They quickly run into another former Dukes' cast mate hamming it up (John Schneider).  The rest of the cast is basically shrew-chow.  Bruce Davison shows up playing a thoroughly dead character from the original film.  (Since the original film was made about 50-some years ago, and Davison is not quite 70 yet, they apparently found a way to make that character younger as well as alive).  The shrews in question are now CGI hoppers that float above the ground and never quite make contact with the people they're supposedly tearing to shreds.  Shoddy workmanship aside, there's really very little to recommend this movie.  Although James Best does have an inexplicable moment where he trots out his acting chops and turns serious and teary over the mention of his former boat mate (the first victim in the original movie).  It's an uncomfortably moving moment that makes no sense in the scheme of things.  The fact that they promise another sequel at the end of this movie fills me with dread.

But.  You just might like this movie depending on your sense of humor and how much you enjoy a cast of nobodies and has-beens mugging for the camera while shrews float by and Bruce Davison purses his lips and makes kissy noises.

In the original James Best as Thorne Sherman and Ken Curtis as Jerry Farrell among others battled the giant scientifically mutated shrews on an island off Texas. Some survived and some didn't. It was a great little fun movie for a Saturday afternoon.

Needless to say I was eager to see 2012's ""Return of the Killer Shrews"" once again starring James Best as Captain Thorne Sherman who is commissioned to take his boat to Blarina Shrew Island with a bunch of buffoons making a reality TV series. What could possibly go wrong? I will bet you can guess. The cast is fairly detestable, with John Schneider as conceited reality show star Johnny Reno among the most annoying. The biggest problem this movie faces is not the functional if predictable premise or plot, not the terrible acting and dialogue, and not even the outrageously comical CGI shrews, which are far more distracting and less realistic than the original collies with cardboard versions. No, the real crux of the problem is that the production tries to be a comedy and fails utterly. While the original played it straight and it worked for what it was, this consists of a lot of strained puns and jokes that try too hard but just feel shoehorned in (see my title for an example).

I trust I'm spoiling nothing to reveal that the basic plot consists of random unlikeable reality show people running around in the woods and getting picked off one by one by the shrews (the Johnny Reno death scene was a hilarious favorite). The bulk of the cast retreats into the old flimsy wooden enclosure of the original (flimsier than the original, actually) and after a hilarious fence electrocution scene Thorne, who's seen it all before of course, narrates the background material with black and white footage from the original intercut with some terrible emoting.

It turns out Jerry (now Bruce Davison, as Ken Curtis died years back; sadly Best has now also passed away) survived the onslaught 50 years ago by retreating to living in a cave where he taught himself how to control the shrews by playing a flute at them, all of which leads, by way of explanation, to the best line of dialogue in the movie: ""I became the alpha shrew!"" After an awkward character reunion and some nonsensical exposition they get off the island with the help of the flute and a methane gas explosion (don't ask). Although Jerry's fate is once again vague here, please enjoy the closing credits with the outstanding song ""Shrewd Attitude""!

The extras are good and are one of the reasons I gave this three stars. The biggest and best extra is the 1959 original movie ""The Killer Shrews"", a commentary with Fred Olen Ray and director Steve Latshaw which is less interesting than some other things I have seen from Ray, a music video that may try your patience, typical ""making of"" stuff, If you're really interested watch for the bit with Dean Torrence (of ""Jan and Dean"") and see what his connection with killer shrews is. It's also a special treat if you happen to be a ""Dukes of Hazzard"" fan, as James Best, John Schneider, and Rick Hurst are all front and center.

Honestly, I was disappointed with ""Return of the Killer Shrews"" and I really wanted to like it.

In the original James Best as Thorne Sherman and Ken Curtis as Jerry Farrell among others battled the giant scientifically mutated shrews on an island off Texas. Some survived and some didn't. It was a great little fun movie for a Saturday afternoon.

Needless to say I was eager to see 2012's ""Return of the Killer Shrews"" once again starring James Best as Captain Thorne Sherman who is commissioned to take his boat to Blarina Shrew Island with a bunch of buffoons making a reality TV series. What could possibly go wrong? I will bet you can guess. The cast is fairly detestable, with John Schneider as conceited reality show star Johnny Reno among the most annoying. The biggest problem this movie faces is not the functional if predictable premise or plot, not the terrible acting and dialogue, and not even the outrageously comical CGI shrews, which are far more distracting and less realistic than the original collies with cardboard versions. No, the real crux of the problem is that the production tries to be a comedy and fails utterly. While the original played it straight and it worked for what it was, this consists of a lot of strained puns and jokes that try too hard but just feel shoehorned in (see my title for an example).

I trust I'm spoiling nothing to reveal that the basic plot consists of random unlikeable reality show people running around in the woods and getting picked off one by one by the shrews (the Johnny Reno death scene was a hilarious favorite). The bulk of the cast retreats into the old flimsy wooden enclosure of the original (flimsier than the original, actually) and after a hilarious fence electrocution scene Thorne, who's seen it all before of course, narrates the background material with black and white footage from the original intercut with some terrible emoting.

It turns out Jerry (now Bruce Davison, as Ken Curtis died years back; sadly Best has now also passed away) survived the onslaught 50 years ago by retreating to living in a cave where he taught himself how to control the shrews by playing a flute at them, all of which leads, by way of explanation, to the best line of dialogue in the movie: ""I became the alpha shrew!"" After an awkward character reunion and some nonsensical exposition they get off the island with the help of the flute and a methane gas explosion (don't ask). Although Jerry's fate is once again vague here, please enjoy the closing credits with the outstanding song ""Shrewd Attitude""!

The extras are good and are one of the reasons I gave this three stars. The biggest and best extra is the 1959 original movie ""The Killer Shrews"", a commentary with Fred Olen Ray and director Steve Latshaw which is less interesting than some other things I have seen from Ray, a music video that may try your patience, typical ""making of"" stuff, If you're really interested watch for the bit with Dean Torrence (of ""Jan and Dean"") and see what his connection with killer shrews is. It's also a special treat if you happen to be a ""Dukes of Hazzard"" fan, as James Best, John Schneider, and Rick Hurst are all front and center.

Honestly, I was disappointed with ""Return of the Killer Shrews"" and I really wanted to like it. It was just too forced and intentionally campy to be fun like the original, but the great extras raised it to a three stars: if you haven't seen the original, please watch it first, but if you like the original feel free to give this a try.",1464912000,,3718,4.627272727272727
