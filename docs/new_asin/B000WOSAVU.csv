2988621,5,B000WOSAVU,I have this and two other ten minute ab workouts. I have been able to chissle my abs into a six pack squeezing these workouts into my busy life. They are challenging enough to keep using them even when you at at a more advanced stage.,1237161600,,234,4.108695652173913
2988622,4,B000WOSAVU,These are quick abdominal exercises that work.  Nice variety & perfect for a faster workout that still leaves you feeling like you've accomplished something.,1231200000,,157,5.541666666666667
2988623,5,B000WOSAVU,"I am very pleased with this DVD. It has 5 very good and very professional trainers that really know what they are doing. My favorites are Violet Zaki and Kimberly. The most challenging work out for is with Gay Gaspar.
I added this DVD to my regular routine and has been doing it for about 3 months. I really can see the results already!
It is not for beginners.
I would recommend this DVD if you are really serious about getting nice and flat abs!",1222819200,,447,4.270588235294118
2988624,5,B000WOSAVU,"I love this AB video. The star trainers are great, I have all of their exercise DVD's. The ab video is nice because each work out is different enough that you don't get burned out on them. I do an alternating different one almost every day- and its been very effective.

2988625,4,B000WOSAVU,"As a fitness professional who is very conditioned and has been performing and teaching abdominal exercises for several years, I was really happy with this DVD.  I can honestly say that this is the best abdominal DVD I have purchased since Tamilee Webb's ""I Want Those Abs.""  I was so impressed with the professionalism  and the creativity of the instructors...even advanced exercisers will feel a serious burn during this workout!  The best instructors by far are Rob, Gay, and Kimberly.  Rob's routine was amazing from start to end.  He really hit the abdominal cavity hard from all angles, and he included some fun isometrics for a great burn and he finished strong with back extensions and breast strokes for overall balance.  Very nice.  Gay was also all business from beginning to end. Her attitude was so fun and encouraging, and she really targets your obliques in her routine.  She has some really fun oblique combinations (but they do require some coordination, so if you're not so coordinated beware!)  Gay finishes strong too with some triceps push-up's/plank combinations.  Perfect.  Kimberly's was the toughest by far.  She begins with a bent knee/leg extension oblique crunch (ouch!!)  Then it's on to some Pilates style roll down's/up's with oblique rotations.  It's tough, but she keeps you motivated and moving, she's really great.  Violet and Kendell's routines were just mediocre, not impressive but not terrible either.  What turned me off about Kendell was that he used weights but did not suggest what poundage to use...not good, especially for beginners.  And though he incorporates weights in his workout, the exercises were not challenging enough to utilize the weights to their fullest potential.  Violet's routine was just kind of same old, same old for me.  Though she's a good instructor, her routine was pretty standard and easy to complete.  I would recommend these last two sessions for beginners or on your lighter abdominal workout days.  Overall, I was very happy and impressed with this DVD and would recommend it to everyone that I know.  I will use this DVD for a very long time.",1207785600,12,2117,5.037463976945245
2988626,2,B000WOSAVU,"I purchased this DVD because I liked the 5 short workouts-- so I could do as many as I wanted in one sitting.  I am not very in shape...as i just had a baby 6 months ago, but I have been working super hard to get my abs back.

Another review said that there are variations on the workouts so a beginner could do it... Not so... I AM a  beginner, and there were a couple workouts that I just had to ff though... I couldn't do the move and i couldn't think of how to alter it, so I could at least try to work up to it.

The only reason this got 2 stars, is because I like the trainers personalities.

Each workout starts with the trainers talking about their workout... too much time between each workout with gibberish...and then the workouts went so fast (as in tempo) that i couldn't keep up.

The strangest thing about each section, is each trainer put in a plug for Propel Fitness Water... so weird...

Pass on this one...find something else.",1205625600,12,945,4.216666666666667

2988628,5,B000WOSAVU,I am a huge fan of trainer Violet Zaki. Her workout in this video is enough reason to buy it. Your abs will be screaming sore for about a week after this. Her attitude is great and she gives perfect cues. She is very original and her moves are highly effective. Being as she shows many modifications of each exercise this video will work for levels beginner to advanced.,1203465600,14,370,4.3768115942028984
2988629,5,B000WOSAVU,"This is the second Star Trainers dvd I have and I really love it.  It's five trainers, doing five different 10 minute ab routines.  There is Rob Glick, Gaye Gasper, Violet Zaki, Kimberly Spreen and Kendell Hogan.  They are all terrific and motivating and know what they're talking about.
There are regular types of moves like plank work and crunches etc, but also some good standing work like lunges with rotations.  Those may not always feel at the time like they're doing much, but trust me, they are.  I tried to do the entire dvd in one go, but I couldn't even do it and I'm fairly experienced and fit.  You can easily do two to three at a time and get great benefits.  That's another reason I love this dvd; because you can do half an hour of abs in different order than yesterday or tomorrow and that makes it less boring.
If you are going to consider buying this, get their cardio dvd too and put them together.  That way, this workout will be much more effective and get better results.  I really like this and will keep using it for a long time yet.",1198540800,22,1058,4.32994923857868

8224525,2,B000WOSAVU,"If you've worked on your abs for a while, and are strong as a result of that work, this is not the product for you. If you're a beginner who doesn't care to be challenged, however, this is the product for you and it will take you years to achieve the abs you want.

First and foremost, the ""10 minute workouts"" are actually much less than 10 because they include stretching. I didn't even get a burn. Second, each of the trainers gives a brief bio at the start of his/her segment. Frankly, that's non-material to me. Show me what you've got, don't tell me. Third, and fourth are all related to the first and second.

If you don't spend sufficient time on anything, you won't get the results you desire. This has been a lesson in reviewing products. Buyer beware.",1462665600,,762,4.397163120567376

8224529,3,B000WOSAVU,"I bought this video for Violet Zaki's ""AbSession"", which I thought was the original of her workout that is on YouTube.  Big disappointment, because it's a totally different workout.  I've read that crunches are pretty much useless, and that seems to be what most of the workouts are.  However, the workouts by Kendall Hogan (who I loved watching and working out with on ExerciseTV) and Kimberly Spreen are awesome.  Their workouts are challenging, but not grueling, and not the boring, endless crunches of the other routines.  All sessions are about 10 minutes each, which is plenty of time for a great workout.",1364256000,,611,4.950980392156863

8224531,5,B000WOSAVU,"Working on core muscles is among the best actions anyone can take to notice an IMMEDIATE difference not just in appearance, but in energy level, groundedness, and colon health. NOTHING that I've done--including consuming all kinds of dietary supplements and eating more salads and raw foods--has energized me more than strengthening my stomach muscles. I only do ONE 10-minute routine from this DVD per day: Rob Glick's workout. What's great about his routine is the way he balances yoga poses with crunches.",1278806400,2,508,5.2073170731707314
8224532,4,B000WOSAVU,"Red Panda has done a great job of breaking out what is included in each of the segments, so I won't repeat all of that.

I do a variety of ab routines.  Usually something like Core Fusion on Tuesday, Squeeze Stronger on Sunday, mix it up on Friday. I used to do more traditional ab routines, but found they weren't as effective.  In comparing single 10-minute segments, I find that this DVD is not as intense from a purely ab perspective as the other DVDs I use.  This is partly because of the variety that is mixed into this DVD.  Where the other routines I use are pure abs for 10 minutes, this one mixes in other exercises as well. This isn't a bad thing really, as I also do planks and back extension work on a regular basis in addition to those other DVDs, where this DVD has segments that combine that all into one. However, this DVD is also not as intense for me because the actual exercises they do to work the abs are not as intense either (at least for me).  So I can do a single segment with more impact from the other DVDs.  But having said that, this is still a very good DVD and I do use it on a fairly regular basis to provide some nice variety. I really like to tackle the abs with a variety of exercises.

The main reason I have rated this DVD as a 4 instead of a 5 is the annoying intros at the beginning of the segments. Even if I use the menu to create a custom workout, I still have to fast forward through the intro.

Rob Glick is my favorite routine as I like his combination of abs, planks, and back extension work.  I do all of these on a regular basis, and this is a nice routine that combines them all.  When I use this DVD I will frequently start with Rob's routine and then add in one other segment.

I also really like Gay Gasper's routine and from an ab perspective think it is the most difficult one on the DVD.  I will use it frequently in combination with Robs, sometimes leaving the additional planks off of Gay's if I'm in a hurry.

I also will mix Violet's routine in with Rob's from time to time.  The ab routine isn't quite as challenging as Gay's but I really like the bird dogs.

I don't use Kendell Hogan's routine very often as I don't combine abs and lower body work on the same day.  I do a very thorough lower body workout on alternate days, including lunges and squats, and want to give my body a break from that on my ab days. The ab work during this session is fairly easy but his side plank combo is very nice.

I have not used Kimberly Spreen's routine. The side crunches with weight on one knee look like something that might bother my sensitive left knee so I have avoided it.",1271462400,,2629,4.141732283464567
8224533,5,B000WOSAVU,"The great thing about the ""Star Trainer"" series is that you get 5 workouts with different trainers who put their own spin on things to make each workout unique.  This compilation of 10-minute ab workouts are all useful for different needs.

ABsolutely Beautiful w/ Rob Glick-Although the name is cheesy, this is a very good workout.  Rob starts off by just doing basic crunches which he eventually builds into intense crunches with your feet and knees in the air.  After he works out your core for about 6-7 minutes, he then moves on to back work before finishing the workout with planks.

ABsession w/ Violet Zaki-Violet starts off with a great warm up as she does 6-count crunches coming up then 2-counts for going back down.  She eventually moves into some faster crunches before moving into some fun ab exercises such as rolling like a ball.  She then finishes up with some planks.

Expresso Abs w/ Gay Gasper-This was the most intense core workout of the bunch and my personal favorite.  She starts off with some easy roll-downs, but then Gay does so many crunches, oblique crunches, pulses, and more that it makes the abs BURN!  She then does some planks, but these are easier than those of other trainers.  She finishes off with a 1-2 minute stretching time.  Now, the other trainers stretch at the end of their workouts, too, but Gay is the only one that has a very nice stretch ending.

Core Blast w/ Kimberly Spreen-This was the easiest routine in the bunch and my personal least favorite.  Although Kimberly is very pleasant, her exercises were TOO easy, and I didn't feel them the next day.  She does some side planks and some more oblique work on your side before going to roll-downs and roll-ups.  She then finishes with some hip bridges.  This workout focuses more on the obliques, and I thought it was better for beginner exercisers.

Peak Performance w/ Kendell Hogan-Kendell's workout requires two hand weights, and I found his routine to be more overall strength compared to just abs.  He does some lunges forward with twists before going to the floor for some crunches and side planks.  He finishes off with supermans.

These 10-minute workouts are great for getting your core in shape in just a little time.  I enjoyed the diversity of the trainers and it led me to buy more in the ""Star Trainers"" series.",1270339200,2,2326,4.719602977667494
8224534,5,B000WOSAVU,"I am always on the lookout for hard AB workouts.  I am by no means in great shape in my abdominal area, but unless it's a tough workout, I really don't feel like I'm even doing any good.  I love Tamilee Webb's I Want that Body, but since there are only 2 ab sections on that DVD, I need a change up.  I saw in another review that this one was as good as Tamilee Webb's so I decided to try it.  I am not dissapointed.  This DVD does live up to the reivews it's been given.  The intros by the trainers at the beginning of each section is a little annoying but I just fast forward through it and I'm fine.  I found that Violet and Kendall's routine were probably the least challenging (although by no means easy).  I usually pair those with one of the other trainers routines to get a good 20 minute ab workout.  If all of the other Star Trainers DVDs are this good I think I'll buy them all!",1251417600,,889,4.034285714285715
