1249606,1,B000022TTG,"Six friends are camping for the weekend in rural country with one of them blind as they go hunting until they hear strange noises, at an old church graveyard where some confederate soldiers died 100 years ago, they have been risen from the dead to devour the flesh of the living.

A rotten attempt to be ""Night of the Living Dead"" despite a clever idea of having confederate undead people but loaded with incoherence, horrid emotionless acting, bad make-up effects and a bad soundtrack, i do NOT recommend this movie and it's only good if you want to have pain. I really wished MST3K should have done this turd.",1337558400,,611,4.605504587155964
1249607,2,B000022TTG,"Curse of the Cannibal Confederates  (1982)  During the VHS video boom of the mid to late 80's, a little company called Troma was doing well releasing low budget (or no-budget) flicks direct to video with goofy titles like Surf Nazis Must Die and The Toxic Avenger. In order to keep their output steady, in addition to their in-house productions they also made a habit of buying just about any extremely cheap horror and exploitation movie they could get their hands on and releasing them under goofy ""Troma-tized"" titles. Case in point, this little horror number, originally called Curse of the Screaming Dead and filmed in 1982 for what looks like a budget that would equal the average couple's bill at Outback, without booze or a Blooming Onion. Troma scooped it up and sent it out on VHS under the above title, which while vaguely wild is nothing compared to stuff like Stuff Stephanie in the Incinerator! and A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell. The story has a camper full of hippie types out for a weekend of fun in the forest, hunting, and doing whatever else long hairs would do in the boonies. The three couples are pretty interchangeable and non descript, except for the blind girl. Everybody whines and bickers for about the first half of the movie, then things go awry when one guy finds an ancient Civil War soldier's diary hidden in the ruins of an old church the group comes across. He takes it for no particular reason, and about 50 minutes into the running time the dead finally rise from the ancient cemetery outside the church. The next twenty minutes become a running battle between the unusually well armed hippies and the zombies, with the score going hippies 8, zombies 0. At this point the biggest effect has been a series of dummy zombie heads exploding when shot with the oft mentioned ""exploding bullets"" the rifle is loaded with. Ah, that explains the smoke filled blast each time one of the ghouls' heads is detonated. We throw in a couple of local policemen who show up out of nowhere, and at long last the bloody gut munching begins as the two old geezers and one of the hippies go down, making the score by this time hippies 14, zombies 3. Now, way back in my youth, the original Night of the Living Dead was shown at my senior prom. After the zombies in the movie have claimed a couple of victims and started their icky feast, my friend Tracey Burnett was heard to comment ""Man, they're running that eating stuff into the ground!"" If only he could have seen the equivalent scene in this movie! While the survivors begin a mad run to escape the horror, the movie screeches to a dead halt for about five minutes to allow the zombies plenty of time to grab, pull, yank, lick, taste , rend and play with long strands of foam rubber guts soaked in blood while LOUD slurping noises are heard on the soundtrack. It is also only after this sequence that the zombies live up to the original title as screams are finally heard over the soundtrack as they lumber about. Prior to that, the original title should have been ""Curse of the Completely Silent Dead with Curiously Explosive Heads."" The hippies start to die off quickly at this point, since there are only about 10 minutes left to the movie. Finally, we reach our big climax, ripped off from The Fog but without the final jolt. Considering how little happens in this movie and how poorly made it is, I didn't exactly hate this movie. I'm not sure that would be true for anyone else, though. I guess I was expecting it to be more like the worst of Troma's homemade product, which often goes for the gusto in bad taste and becomes mean spirited in the hopes of offending you since there's no other way to get an audience reaction with a movie made on a budget of the change found in Troma founder Lloyd Kaufman's couch cushions any given weekend. Since this movie was sincere in trying to be a real movie, no matter how badly it failed at it, I had a softer reaction to it. Still, not sure anyone else would feel that way, so unless you're a zombie movie completist, you're probably going to want to avoid this one.",1229040000,,4095,4.532432432432432
1249608,2,B000022TTG,"The movie begins as 6 idiots go to some woods to go camping for the a couple nights. Then they stumble upon a graveyard and a church, then finds a box with a confederate flag and a diary. Some blonde wants to take the flag and be rich. Anyways some skinny dude mysteriously takes the diary and reads it to a blind asian chick. Then out of the blue, confederate zombies arise from the grave to reclaim the diary. The living was too stupid to realize the diary was the reason why the dead was screaming like girls  (the diary holds a senimental value to the dead)! So some people got eaten alive the diary was returned to the dead and some of the living was spared!
This was an okay film. Though it had bad picture (52% watchable), the human inerds looked like KFC chicken covered in blood, the camera shots from one person to the next was way off, the acting stinked (it's a b-movie, what do you expect) the ending was stupid.......... but in the end the guns blowing off zombie heads (that looked like boxes exploding) was entertainment enough! Worth a purchase at a low price!",1061769600,3,1077,4.385
1249609,3,B000022TTG,"Lloyd Kaufman (President of Troma studios and creator of the Toxic Avenger) warned us about this film. He said that it was one of Troma's five worst films ever. But with a name like ""Curse of the Cannibal Confederates"", I just HAD to see this movie.
Originally released from various distributers as ""Curse of the Screaming Dead"", a group of campers are getting away for the weekend, but when a nosey one steals a dead confederate's diary, the decomposed flesh hits the fan !
If you want to find any enjoyment in this film, stick it in the camp catagory. It's great for a ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" type of party. The acting is horrendous, the exploytation is remarkible, and the bloodshed is awesome ! Technologically speaking however, the movie is poorly made (although it contains a great score!) and is a far cry from great Troma flicks like ""Combat Shock"" and ""Terror Firmer"".
Although it lasts about a reel too long, it is still definetly worth checking out. For Troma fans only, otherwise you won't understand. Rumors of there being an unreleased sequel/prequel have surfaced around the internet so keep your eyes peeled !",981244800,4,1130,4.770408163265306
7915333,2,B000022TTG,"The title alone should tell you all you need to know about this ultra-mega-dud, TROMA offering. Whewee! All the prerequisites are here: ding-a-ling dialogue, sub-sub-par ""acting"", a meaningless ""plot"", and ""special"" effects / costumes that could be found in any attic or thrift store. CURSE OF THE CANNIBAL CONFEDERATES (aka: THE CURSE OF THE SCREAMING DEAD 1982) finds a group of campers / deer hunters, led into the deep woods by a Cat Stevens clone and his friend, a Gregg Allman lookalike! There, they come across an old cemetery where the title flesh-eaters are eventually found. These zombies are -almost- as frightening as the groovy ghouls in Michael Jackson's THRILLER video, minus the dancing. Some are in make-up, while others are wearing halloween masks from Wal-Mart! Worth seeing to witness the Cat Stevens and Gregg Allman lookalikes waving guns around! Otherwise, this is one dreadfully long trip to nowhere. The ""fireworks scene"" is especially cheeeze-filled! Awfully, horribly, insanely bad!...",1494806400,,1012,5.371069182389937
7915334,1,B000022TTG,I enjoy Civil War history and horror movies so I thought I would give it a chance. It's really dumb and the production was even worse.,1483574400,,134,4.1923076923076925
7915335,3,B000022TTG,I remember watching this movie as a little girl and I really remember the music in particular! But seeing this movie now is kind of embarrassing but I'll give it three stars because of the fond memories that I had at the time. (kids sure scare easily)However it takes  40 minutes for the zombies to arrive on the scene and the movie still sucks. Everything is way too long and drawn out.,1465344000,,387,4.375

7915337,2,B000022TTG,This movie is supposedly in the top five worst movies in the troma catalog. I believe it. If you want to watch thia movie just skip forward to about the halfway mark and start watching. You won't miss much. Also watch in  the dark the video is so dark half the time its hard to see anything.,1461283200,,291,4.105263157894737
7915338,1,B000022TTG,A very slow movie with poor dialogue and poor delivery. Gross towards the end. Not much to get out of this movie. You might what to have a book to read while watching this to you choose to.,1459728000,,189,4.0
7915339,1,B000022TTG,Not good,1448409600,,8,3.5
7915340,1,B000022TTG,Another Trauma film ~ nuff said about this producers of this drive-in crapola!,1439942400,,78,5.076923076923077
7915341,1,B000022TTG,"It's bad...for a Troma movie. And a poor Cannibal/Zombie flick. Takes halfway through to get to them and it dragged all along the way. The film should've been a half hour shorter.

I would suggest you fast forward to at least the half-hour mark and watch from there..if you dare to watch it at all.",1438041600,,298,4.418181818181818
7915342,5,B000022TTG,So bad it was good. A classic and a worthy competitor of Plan 9 from outer space. If it could be done in 3D it might even be better.,1393372800,,132,3.586206896551724
