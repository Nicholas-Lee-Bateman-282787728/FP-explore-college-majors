8269956,5,B0018L4BEG,"I am a Nationally Certified Massage Therapist and Bodyworker (NCBTMB), have been involved with alternative therapies for well over 20 years, and was trained in Traditional Ayurveda almost 10 years ago. I operate my own private practice, and, teach bodywork.

I enjoyed the video because it shows a more traditional form of Ayurvedic Massage. It was weak on describing what marmas are and how to work with them more specifically, however.

It demonstrates a routine on the floor. It could easily be adapted to work on a table however, saving the practitioner the poor body mechanics that would otherwise lead to fatigue early on.

One caution - if nudity offends you, you may want to look elsewhere. Many countries, other than the USA, do not view nudity during bodywork as offensive, and, this video demonstrates this with the female client being topless throughout the shoot.",1220054400,4,876,5.027586206896552
