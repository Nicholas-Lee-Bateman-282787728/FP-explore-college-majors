8235743,5,B000ZK91X2,Very fast response after purchase.  Wonderful movie.  Good Job Richard Crawford/creator.,1463184000,,88,6.909090909090909
8235744,5,B000ZK91X2,"I have never seen a movie that better captured the feel of 1968. The sometimes casual, sometimes abrasive, junction of ""hip"" and ""straight"" is portrayed well. Most period movies are too ""psychadelic"" to portray the times. ""Captain Milkshake"" is not a slick production, it is, however, a very heartfelt movie.

It is the only time I have ever seen a portrayal of the surreal feeling of being on an airliner headed back to the world.

It is hard to imagine, almost fifty years later, why it caused such outrage at the time.",1449792000,,521,4.6521739130434785
8235745,5,B000ZK91X2,"You will not find a more authentic movie about this period in American history. The music, the people, the culture - and the message. This is not your typical fairy tale; it is a take you back in time revival with a message that will still grab you by the heart today. Contemplative, quirkly, and totally nostalgic. A must see for those.",1439424000,,337,4.451612903225806
8235746,5,B000ZK91X2,"Captain Milkshake was a film released ahead of its time, that truly captures two opposing viewpoints colliding head on. The first is represented in the main character, a soldier on a weekend furlough from his tour in Vietnam, who experiences and starts to connect with the counterculture anti-war movement. The second half of the film is beautifully shot for a low budget production and I couldn't rave more about the wonderful soundtrack. Great performances all around, leading to a heartbreaking ending that will leave a lump in your throat. A must watch Vietnam era film. Highly highly recommended.",1439164800,,601,5.142857142857143
8235747,5,B000ZK91X2,"Captain Milkshake is a must for anyone who grew up during the 60's and 70's, loves history/nostalgia, and for those who appreciate what a pivotal time it was in advancing human rights...",1438992000,,186,4.84375
8235748,5,B000ZK91X2,"This is a great movie, very telling, and is a very real life account about a solider in Viet Nam. Great music in the soundtrack. Buy it you'll like it. Captain Milkshake is a wonderful movie on the 60's.",1438819200,,203,4.230769230769231
8235749,5,B000ZK91X2,"Move over Easy Rider. Captain Milkshake captures the heart and soul of the sixties and leaves you gasping for breath.  A squeeky-clean Vietnam soldier comes home on family leave to find his world turned into psychedelic dream. With soundtrack including the Steve Miller band, this is a midnight movie, cult classic not to be missed.",1437177600,,332,5.036363636363636
8235750,5,B000ZK91X2,great classic cult film..I would recommend it to everyone if they are even a tad curious about the late 60's early 70's this is the movie to watch,1416614400,,146,4.25
