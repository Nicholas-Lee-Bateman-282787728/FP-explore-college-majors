8597999,3,B00DUQIETU,"The production is shortened to 87 minutes.  On comparing this version to the several Italian version that I own, I think that the English translation, while nice, loses some of the fluidity present in the original Italian.  The sets are beautiful, the sound clear and the image quality is very good.  Teresa Stratas is lovely both visually and vocally.  However, I found that the 2009 Metropolitan opera production of La Rondine with Gheoghu and Alagna much more satisfying and the 1982 La Traviata directed by Zefarelli a much better example of Ms Stratas's abilities.  There is nothing wrong with the production, but compared to the other DVD's available of La Rondine it is lacking.  If one is seeking their first exposure to La Rondine try another of the 5 or so DVD's available.",1378944000,5,783,4.849624060150376
