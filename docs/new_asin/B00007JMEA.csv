1814546,1,B00007JMEA,"This is a really stupid movie. The ""humor"" includes the hero disguising himself at a patch of ground in a pasture with a cow pie for a face to the villain repeatedly emitting large amounts of gas. The rest of the gags are about as funny. Target audience seems to be boys age 10-13.",1028505600,8,281,4.222222222222222
1814547,1,B00007JMEA,"It was painful to sit and watch the 45 mins that I did.
Even the kids in the theater weren't laughing.
I guess if you're a 4 year old boy then you might appreciate it.
Sorry Dana, I was disapointed to say the least.",1028419200,8,215,3.909090909090909
1814548,1,B00007JMEA,"I gave this movie one star only because I can't give it a zero.  My wife and I couldn't wait to see this movie, due to the previews and trailers which were hysterical.  Sadly, these were the best parts of the movie.  20 minutes into it, I wanted to cry for the loss of my hard earned money, but I kept saying to myself maybe it'll get better.  IT DID NOT!  Half way through this master of disgust (I Mean Disguise) I Heard some kid tell his dad it was stupid, they were the smart ones they left the movie.  In a nut shell, don't waste your time or money.  If you have to see it wait to rent it.  Personally, I would watch it again if someone paid me.",1028332800,9,650,3.9461538461538463
1814549,5,B00007JMEA,"In this summer's most unexpected masterpiece, Dana Carvey delivers an Oscar-clinching performance as the ""master of disguise,"" portraying a myriad of captivating and unique characters. I cannot express how important it is that you see this movie.  If you're only going to see one movie this summer, or even one movie in this lifetime, it MUST be ""Master of Disguise!""",1028332800,3,367,5.116666666666666

Now he has to be trained to save the treasures and bring them back safely. If Dana Carvey sounds familar, he was a regular on the old Saturday Night Live which has reruns on Comedy Central. Now he has to be in many different costumes to save the world such as ""Mr. Turtle""(that's not it's name, but it's tenative), a rich entreptur, and George W. Bush to name a few.

1814726,1,B00007JMEA,"I LOVE Dana Carvey's impressions and impersonations. He is THE Master. And, I had seen reviews and heard about how terrible this movie is. I thought that, surely, there's something redeemable or funny in it. I did not heed the warnings, and, for once, they were/are 100% true. This could well be the worst movie ever made. There are other more ""bad"" movies--offensive and/or destructive to emotion/intelligence/intellect/spirit. This is ""none of those,"" but it just really is the worst made. There's really no writing involved. It's a horrible excuse for a movie. One would think that, surely, even accidentally, there would be something here. But, NO. I like a lot of silly Adam Sandler movies (he produced this), but this is no where near that ""good."" Yikes! With Carvey's immense talent, he should have become at least as famous as Sandler--with the right vehicle. Perhaps he was done a terrible disservice--the movie does not showcase his real/true talent at all. Perhaps it's because Carvey is a genius at impersonation, but not CREATING characters. You see, aside from the George H.W. Bush impersonation at the end of the movie, all of the characters 'impersonated' by Carvey are ""originals."" --he's 'merely' acting characters. And they are dull, lifeless, pointless. Without material from actual people to impersonate and draw satire from, Carvey is empty. One cannot imPERSONate a non-person. --He could not imbue his characters with personality, believability, humor, or...anything. I am greatly saddened by this, but, at least we all learned something. Carvey is a genius at impersonating existing people, but, then again, ""the Church Lady"" and several other SNL characters were wonderful. Go figure. I'm at a total loss. What a terrible shame. I must, however, disclaim that my nine year old son liked it and watched it three times.",1478390400,,1843,5.167224080267559

1814729,1,B00007JMEA,"""It never ended, and it was only 80 minutes."" - Roger Ebert
""An awful, stillborn comedy.""- Entertainment Weekly
""The third worst comedy I have ever seen."" - Mike Nelson
(Me: Wait, WHAT?!! Repeat that, please).
""The third worst comedy I have ever seen.""- Mike Nelson
(Me: Oh, God...!)

So, let me just start of by making this quite plain: to review a bad comedy is one of the toughest things to review. Because there is only so many times you can say ""That's not funny!"", and on top of that, only so much that a person like me can take. So...rather than look at this film as a comedy, I'm instead going to look at it as...cinematic suicide. A film that wants to die, and tries absolutely everything it can possibly do in its power in order to perish, die, and be sent to the depths of hell where Satan can use it as torture to all of his victims, whom I feel utmost sorry for because Lord, little would they know what awaited them. That way, when I shove it up Dana Carvey's anal passage, I will feel no guilt whatsoever. With that said...Master of Disguise.",1475884800,,1057,4.365482233502538

1814953,5,B00007JMEA,"I absolutely understand why people didn't like this movie. With Dana Carvey in the lead role one would expect a movie geared more for adults and that may very well be the intent they had when making this movie but it ended up being a movie more for kids. No swear words, no sexual situationsa very clean movie and the humor, as eye rolling as it can be for adults, is really something kids will laugh at more than adults but I do have to admit the segment on the little row boat named Orca was pretty funny but that may be because I had recently seen jaws on cable so it was fresh in my mind. This is also a great get away movie. Had a bad day? Week? Feeling run down, like just shutting out and off the world? THIS is one of those movies to watch over and over. It makes a great comfort, forget it all, get away movie in every way, in my opinion, and that is when it can truly be appreciated for what it offers.  Other reviews give more details about the movie itself but I really recommend at least one watch especially in those need to escape situations.",1428624000,2,1057,4.131067961165049

He's a good comedian and carries the film well. Jennifer Esposito is not weak on my eyes but proves me more than just eye candy as she gives a great acting performance. Jennifer was great in an Oscar winning film 'Crash' and here we see flashes of her brilliance. As for the film I think it's not be taken seriously and nor is it Citizen Kane. It's a good comedy and a good light family movie.
  I say both rent and buy this movie because I was surprised of how good it was. The price to buy is very cheap. It's funny and a light comedy. Light comedies are good. Carvey's impersonations were great and funny. I liked his Robert Shaw one doing 'Quint' from Jaws. If you decide to see or buy the movie I hope you like it. Cheers!",1420329600,,882,4.063218390804598

1815076,4,B00007JMEA,"I was surprised to see how many bad reviews have been posted for this movie, but I guess I can understand.  Out of curiosity, I read a lot of the reviews, and I can see the kind of people who hate this movie.  They take themselves way too seriously-- they're the sort of people you can't stand being around for more than five minutes because everything is drama and everything is about them.  It's so easy to type people sometimes.

This movie is funny.  If you have to have ""serious"" comedy, you may not like this.  Too bad.  It's all about the lead character putting on funny costumes and making funny faces.  That's pretty much it.  There are lots of funny impressions. This is the kind of movie where you quit thinking for 80 minutes, and just have some good laughs.

The only part I don't like is the scatological humor.  The villain passes gas a lot, and I don't find that funny.  But everything else is, so I give it a pass.

This movie is funny if you can avoid taking yourself too seriously.  Some people seem to think it's a kid's movie; I don't know, I wouldn't show it too kids under ten or so.  Watch it first yourself and make your own parenting decision on that one.  But for adults, I think it's worth a good laugh.",1388361600,2,1231,4.28695652173913

""Master of Disguise"" seems to me to be a plagiarism of the title of the book with the same name by CIA agent Tony Mendez (publ. 1999).

But I figured, since I watched it from the middle, if I watched it from the beginning, I would understand the story better, no such luck. The problem, I finally concluded, was that the story was just terrible. Dana Carvey tries and fails to construct a plot, with the main character disguising, as stated by the title, to get information on who kidnapped his father. The problem, all his disguises are completely absurd and have no impact whatsoever on the story. In fact, all his disguises do is get him into trouble. Trying to construct a chase scene resulted in a nonsensical chase between the main protaganist and the antagonists henchmen. first they chase the protaganist disguised as a disruptive partygoer and then suddenly they realize what he really looks like without actually seeing his face. The plot was very simple and it seemed like carvey was trying to sqeeuze in the disguising just to justify the title. The power the Disguises had, called energico was very terribly explained and the ending with it, the dark side, please! in fact the story makes practically no sense, is so stereotypical, and has anything short of stimulating. That in fact, is what makes it funny. The jokes and puns are so painfully bad it's hilarious. The story might not make an iota of sense but I realized I didn't mind it one bit. Dana Carvey might be a terrible writer, but one thing can be said about him: he's a comedian. The story may suck, but boy is it funny!!!

This movie co-stars Austin Wolff, Kenan Thompson,  Gabriel Pimentel, Jesse Ventura, Michael Johnson, Bo Derek, Jessica Simpson, Buddy Bolton, Edie McClurg, Vincent Riverside, Michael Bailey Smith, Maria Canals, Mark Devine and Jay Johnston. This movie is LMFAO hilarious. Dana Carvey has attempted to create a vehicle for his career. Just like how Mike Myers did with AUSTIN POWERS and Jim Carrey with ACE VENTURA. This vehicle epic failed to capture true film critics. This movie shows Dana Carvey's talent of impersonating celebrities and movie characters. The best disguises include Turtle Man, Terry Suave, Quint, Al Pacino, Constable Mueller, Mayor Maynot and Prince Lalijama of the Ringidingi Heights near Bombay, Calcutta, and New Delhi, India, India, India, India. The movie is one of my favorites but critics and movie goers did not care for its immature sense of humor. Some of my favorite scenes include a Disguisey ancestor dressed as President Abe Lincoln dancing to I LIKE TO MOVE IT, the SHREK immitation (especially if you listen to it in French) and I will leave it at that in order to see for yourselves. This is an article on THE MASTER OF DISGUISE from Wikipedia:

Many critics considered the plot sophomoric, compounding the fact that there were several ""disguises"" that would clearly not be recognized by youngsters (Tony Montana from SCARFACE, for example). In March 2007, aggregate review website Rotten Tomatoes ranked the movie as the 18th worst-reviewed movie of the 00's decade, with a 2% fresh rating. Comedian and former MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 host Mike Nelson named the film as the third-worst comedy ever made or he has ever seen.

I felt betrayed by Mike Nelson's review, I worshipped him (I still do but why hate this movie?). Well, anyway, 5 out of 5 star rating. Peace out!",1267488000,2,2011,5.1063829787234045

1815237,1,B00007JMEA,"What the hell is this? It looks like Dana Carvey has just ruined his career with this comedy that is anything but funny. The childish humor and tedious sight gags are so off-putting I wonder if the crew members tried hard to keep awake during filming. Carvey's performance is also a minus; Pistachio Disguisey is probably his worst character yet. I'm sure not every Italian-American acts like the way he does. The disguses, also, fail to impress. The Turtle Guy is a big miss; Scarface is almost an insult. Even the George W. Bush impression near the end wasn't funny enough.

The Master of Disguise was originally going to be R-rated, but Carvey wanted it to have a PG atmosphere. Well, to tell you the truth, I would have loved to see an R-rated version of this, because THIS version right here fails in almost every way. I know it's a family-friendly film, but I'm guessing the kids and parents that watched this film slept through it. With the exception of Brent Spiner's amusing performance and the Quint impression, I feel sorry for watching this film in the first place.

1815310,3,B00007JMEA,"""Master of Disguise"" is a silly film starring Dana Carvey (Garth from Wayne's World), dressed up as a whole lot of different people. I wanted to like this film a lot, and I tried to, but it didn't quite get there.

Mild mannered foreign waiter Pistachio Disguisey (Dana Carvey) doesn't know that for hundreds of years his family have been Masters of Disguise. It is a little suspicious that he got urges to mock and imitate people growing up, but his father, a retired spy, brushes it off. There's no way that Pistachio is going to lead the dangerous life of a spy, so his secret powers must remain secret. One night, Pistachio's father is kidnapped by a master thief (Brent Spiner), who forces him to use his powers of disguise to steal famous artefacts from history (the American constitution, the two ruby slippers from Wizard of Oz, etc). To save Pistachio's Dad, Granfather Disguisey comes to Pistachio, teaching him the secrets to being a Master of Disguise. Soon, Pisatachio is a level 1 apprentice, and can be all sorts of people. Will this be enough to rescue his dad?

It seemed like a really good idea for a movie, get Dana Carvey to dress up as all sorts of people and things. The film does play a lot of its own cheesiness for laughs, and I appreciate that, but a lot of the impersonations and jokes kind of fall flat. It was a bit weird that Pistachio's ""default setting"" was a man with an accent, who was a bit odd to begin with. There basically is no normal character Dana plays, and I would have liked to see him play himself, just to see the contrast between him and his characters.

My favorite disguise of Dana/Pistachio's is probably the Turtle Man, who's this bald headed man in a big round suit like a turtle shell, with a pointy upper lip, and a habit of saying ""Turtle"" in a Kermit the Frog kind of voice. In a fight scene, he bites off a persons nose, leaving bare skin on the enemies face, which was so silly I had to laugh.

Special features include some making of features, with interviews with the cast, crew as well as Dana Carvey himself, and a music video.

Not the best comedy film in the world, but there's enough goofiness in it to keep it together. It grows on you too, after seeing it a couple of times. Three and a half stars.",1161907200,3,2265,4.409090909090909
1815311,5,B00007JMEA,"When I first watched this movie a couple of years ago I thought I'd missed something. It was a relatively entertaining family movie, but I would have struggled to recount what it was about. Seeing it again recently it totally cracked me up, it's up there with Drop Dead Fred. I love the dichotomy of an utterly earnest character with such a ridiculous accent. The dichotomy of the extreme earnestness and ridiculous behaviour coming from Carver's character is similar to Tom Green's performance in Freddy Got Fingered. The use of such a non-contemporary concept is another vital part of the film's appeal. The historical fantasy of the family history adds an enchanting backdrop to the ridiculous preceedings. ""He thinks your name is pistachios"". ""That is my name"". It doesn't have a strong narrative, but I don't think that's something that detracts from what the movie is. It seems like this movie probably disappointed the largest number of viewers of any movie of the 2000s, and I don't know what to make of that. If you go into this movie expecting something typical, or especially realistic, you'll probably be disappointed, but if you're open-minded enough to take it on it's own terms it will grow on you.

1815317,1,B00007JMEA,"Despite the fact that MASTER OF DISGUISE has an 80 minute run-time, it is actually quite less if you cut out all of the ""extra"" garbage they give you during the credits.  Yet, despite the fact that the actual film is something like 65 minutes, I barely managed to get through it.  It is a strange phenomenon: all that a film has to do is entertain me (reasonably) for an hour.  Yet, MASTER OF DISGUISE fails miserably.  I mean, I have managed to keep myself entertained watching the Discovery channel and such.  But, during this film, I kept looking for a reason to go get some more popcorn.  Thus, as my title explains, I think that this movie is a close approximation to what burning for eternity will be like in the eternal fires of Dante's Inferno: non-stop showings of MASTER OF DISGUISE in which I can't leave the theater or fall asleep.

There is nothing to like about this movie.  It is dumb on a stick.  Of course, I did enjoy a couple of Carvey's impersonations, but I would have rather seen them developed a bit more in a stand-up act.  Why anyone ever thought they could turn this shell of a movie into a film is beyond me.

Perhaps the funniest scene comes at the end when Carvey looks at us, dead-center, and asks us why we're still watching the film (after the credits).  Okay...it's been done before.  But before I reached for the remote, I found myself uttering: ""good point, Dana.""  Now, why couldn't everyone have put me out my misery earlier by having this clip pop up ""before"" the film.

However, the dad of Carvey's character wanted to protect his son, so he protected his son from the family's dangerous legacy.  Yet when his parents are kidnapped Carvey, his grandfather, and a recently hired assitee have to help Carvey become his destiny.

My sweet, forgiving husband swears Carvey, lead-actor and writer on this production, suffered from some kind of brain affliction not too long ago thereby making the headache-inducing Master of Disguise an excusable repercussion of severe head trauma.  There are a few moments throughout the film that warrant small chuckles.  Unfortunately, these are completely ruined by the movies redundancy.  Anything even remotely funny gets repeated so often by the time the audience reaches the brain-numbing conclusion that one begins to feel ashamed for laughing at the gag the first time around.

1815380,1,B00007JMEA,"""The Master of Disguise"" is a terrible, terrible, movie. I don't see how this movie can appeal to anybody, including children to whom this movie is aimed at. I hated it. There was no point for it to be released in the movies, and it could have been a direct to video movie, and it wouldn't have ever made a difference. it is only about 65 minutes long, with a good 15 minutes worth of credits that just have outtakes and deleted scenes. Without the credits, this could be one of the shortest movies ever made, the lenght of the silent movies back in 1910. The biggest problem with ""The Master of Disguise"" is that it doesn't work on any level. The story is just plain dumb, the acting is horrible, and the movie is filled with A list actors, none of them which would make me want to put them back on the A list. I used to think Dana Carvey was funny before this movie came out. I have only given four other movies one star. ""The Sum of All Fears,"" ""Bridjet Jone's Diary,"" ""A Mighty Wind,"" and ""House of the Dead."" For this to be among those movies must be badd. I probably laughed twice during this movie, and even those jokes were things that I wouldn't laugh at again.
The story is about Pistachio Disguisey who is a young man who works as a waiter at his parents Italian resturant. He lives with his father Frabbrizio and his mother, who he one days wishes to marry a women just like her. That women is Sophia, who reminds him just of her. What Pistachio doesn't know is that his father and his grandfather and all of his ancesters are masters of disguises. They could transform into anything they want to. His father foiled the plans of Devlin Bowman years ago, and now he's back from prision for revenge. He kidnaps Pistachio's parents, and uses the father to disguise himself as famous people to steal famous things, and he uses the mother to cook. Pistachio becomes scared because he doesn't know what to do, and he gets a visit from his grandfather who begins to train him to become a master of disguise. Grandpa tells Pistachio that he needs a person to help him, and he uses Jennifer, who needs the work. Jennifer and Pistachio go to rescue his parents from Devlin Bowman, which forces him to use many different disguises to do so.
Yes, I know, the plot could sound appealing for people, including kids, but the movie is nothing but boring. It was just a terrible movie. There was one scene, in the commericals part of it is shown, where Pistachio is dressed up as a turtle. The kids in the theatre knew the scene from the commericals, but nobody laughed at it. It may have sounded funny in the commerical, but in the moving itself, it just didn't work. It was a stupid reason to show a joke like that, and the scene contains him biting off a person's nose. That was just plain stupid. Nobody laughed at that either. ""The Master of Disguise"" is a good movie to watch if you want to be bored, and you want to cut your arm off so you can have something to throw around as something to do. I didn't like it, but you might.

Perhaps the only regret is that we (Dana Carvey fans) can see that he is capable of much more and his genius has been grossly underused in this production.  Having said that, one can get a glimpse of his talent from the various characters that Dana has come up with in this feature.  Clearly, this movie was aimed for the kids and they would definitely enjoy it...a lot!!!  There are no scenes that parents need to be concerned about which makes it a very family-friendly feature.

After the mildly interesting Pop-up book style credits, the movie has nothing going for it beyond Jennifer Esposito's comeliness. Otherwise, you get endless mugging, scenes paced for comedy if you find ""Teletubbies"" intentionally hilarious, and a painfully unfunny flatulence gag every time Brent Spiner's evil genius gives his evil laugh. Every time. It happens a lot. Brent Spiner looks embarassed every time, and I'm not sure it was acting. Supposedly this is for kids, but I can't see it working that way except as a bright, shiny, goo-goo-ga-ga time keeper for infants who have no awareness of the movie's context.

They were enthralled from the very beginning, even laughing through the rather lengthy page-flip intro of the cast. The main character, Pistachio ,was so well done. He is a total geek but with such a sweet, endearing and gentle heart. The plot was a bit thin but the joy of this movie lies in its innocence. Flatulence and large bottoms are as naughty as it gets and the slapping scenes are so ""Three Stooges"" that even they are funny. Even the love story of the film is handled in such a non-sexual way as to make it totally wholesome and sweet.

I would of rather watch the preview 500 times than watch the movie.",1072915200,,379,4.338028169014085
1815406,2,B00007JMEA,"""Master of Disguise"" features ex-Waynes World and SNL member Dana Carvey as an Italian waiter Pistachio Disguisey, whose families have long been protected the world from evil using the art of disguise.  Pistachio himself is not aware of this family secret until one day his father and mother are kidnapped by a megalomaniac villain Devlin Bowman.
The story above is nothing but an excuse for showcasing the impersonations by Dana Carvey.  He disguises himself as George W Bush, Al Pacino (Latin version), and a cherry pie.  Surely some of them are funny at first, but many adult fans soon find him irritating or even pathetic.
The reason is that you cannot make movies in this way.  The film is only 80 minuites, and that includes very extended end credits including deleted scenes and outtakes.  This fact betrays that the film is too thin in contents, but they should have known that from the first.
Of course, kids might think it is funny (and it is notable that the film collected more than $40 million in USA alone, which is a considerable figure).  But think this way.  The opening scene of the film has Bo Derek (yes, that's her!) as a cameo.  I don't think that kids would get it (not many of them recognize her).  SO, for whom is this film made?
Carvey impersonating Robert Shaw (from ""Jaws"") is certainly funny, and he is good at it even though the gag would fly over the head of the kids, who would rather prefer ""Turtle Guy.""  And many adults in turn would find it very ... boring.
The film is based on a misguided idea -- impersonation, which means playing someone else.  Dana Carvey should have found his own voice first.  Like Mike Meyers who found in Austin Powers; like Harrison Ford in Solo and Indie; like Cameron Diaz in Charlie's Angels and dangling hair-gel.  Without a good character you cannot sustain the whole 80 minutes and the audiences' attention.  Impersonation is alright as long as you do it in your own way.  Now see TV shows, and many non-professionals do pretty good impersonations.  But Mike Meyers created Austin and Dr. Evil which none of them could not produce.
You see supporting cast such as Brent Spiner (Data of ""Star Trek"") and Jennifer Esposito.  They are sadly wasted, both in a very embarrassingly underwritten role.  And the cameos like Jesse Ventura, Paula Abdul, and Jessica Simpson do not help at all.
I know Dana Carvey underwent several surgeries in the past several years before making this film.  I know my review would sound harsh, but you cannot send a wrong message, saying that this is very funny.  It is not.  His fans should see his earlier film ""Opportunity Knocks"" he made about ten years ago, instead.  That is not a masterpice, but far better and enjoyable.",1070236800,2,2722,4.686315789473684

It's not deep, but plenty of creative laughs.  We only hope more movies like this are forthcoming and this venture doesn't get critiqued into submission.

1815408,4,B00007JMEA,"There are a lot of people who think that Dana Carvey is washed up. For them, THE MASTER OF DISGUISE has cemented that fact. After all, THE MASTER OF DISGUISE is not a great movie. In fact from a cynical, adult perspect many would say that it is a terrible movie. However, THE MASTER OF DISGUISE wasn't made for cynical adults. It was made for the youth of America. Sure there are references that only those over 18 will get (e.g. the allusions to The Sopranos), but those were thrown in to appease parents who would be watching this film with their children. Therefore, THE MASTER OF DISGUISE is brilliant work.
Brilliant? Brilliant? Yes, brilliant. Dana Carvey has made a movie that has made him an icon for a whole new generation of Americans. The popularity of this movie among youth is astounding; I haven't heard so much buzz with the youth of America since HOLES (the book, not the movie) came out. Kids all across the country are quoting this movie. Even though many adults have not allowed themselves to enjoy the movie, lines from THE MASTER OF DISGUISE will become a permanent part of the American lexicon. Even though the movie didn't do very well at the box office, based off the success of the video and how popular the movie is with youth I wouldn't doubt if a sequel will soon be in the works.
Based upon the usual technical aspects of filmmaking and the things that make a good movie, I wouldn't rate this movie above 3 stars. However, seeing how it has reintroduced me to the genius of Dana Carvey and the brilliant way that he has established his career for years to come, the movie gets 4 stars.",1064966400,4,1614,4.493197278911564

1815411,1,B00007JMEA,"My goodness gracious me. This movie is so mind-numbingly, incongruously bad and contained so many jokes that lumbered off the screen and tanked pitifully that it has become, for me, the worst film I've ever seen.
""Hey! I like Dana Carvey! It can't be THAT bad!"" I hear you ask. So what's wrong with it?
First of all, the opening credits drone on for about five minutes, possibly because there wasn't enough movie to fill 80 minutes. If this is a children's movie, certainly the golden rule would be to grab their attention from the get-go. I can't imagine young kids being riveted to the screen watching credits drone on and on. Even myself, an adult, had already lost interest by the time the movie started.
Second, the impersonations and characters Carvey does, which are the crux of the comedy of the movie, are pointless. He's written the film around things he can play, rather than writing and story and finding ways of putting characters in. So we're left to watch things like his Al Pacino 'Scarface' impersonation (is this a children's movie??) or his 'Turtle Man'. The latter is an inexorable five minute turkey where Carvey dresses up as a Turtle and walks around saying ""turtle"". Sound hilarious enough for you? As a finish to the Turtle scene, Carvey bites the nose off a rude party guest (the nose simply disappears from the man's face), spits it back on (it reattaches itself somehow) and then proceeds to have some sort of paroxysm or embolism on the floor (???[]?). His impersonations simply consist of inhabiting a character and then spewing whatever dialogue you would expect. For example, what do you think Al Pacino says? ""Say hello to my little friend!"" What do you think a dapper British gent says? ""What what, old chum... (insert other stereotypical British colloquialisms)."" And then there's a ludicrous poolside George Bush Jnr impersonation. Why is it in the movie? Most probably because Dana Carvey is good at impersonating him, and not for any other reason.
The dialogue is terrible. The acting is abysmal. The jokes are tired and predictable. For example, the bad guy, played by Brent Spiner (Data from Star Trek) flatulates whenever he breaks into a maniacal laugh. That may be funny once. But twice? No. Three times? FOUR times? FIVE? then SIX, SEVEN AND EIGHT TIMES????? It could have at least been left out on one occasion just to stump the audience.
I can't see how children would enjoy this movie. Perhaps they would. Maybe really, really little kids. There's so many other movies out there they would prefer, like Hook, The Iron Giant, Toy Story... just about every children's movie ever made. I like those movies as well. But this one, 'The Master of Disguise', is such a terrible abomination, such a ghastly aberration, that every copy should be recalled, doused in petrol, and set alight. Then burned again, just to be safe.",1059264000,8,2863,4.821138211382114

1815414,1,B00007JMEA,"THE MASTER OF DISGUISE is produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison productions and co-executive produced by Sandler, which should give potential viewers a warning about what they're in for.
Dana Carvey (who co-scripted) plays Pistachio Disguisey, a dimbulb waiter whose only real talent is for doing impersonations, which he uses to unwittingly insult his customers. Coincidentally, this moronic behaviour is a genetic ""gift"" that runs in his family.
Masters of Disguise have been in the Disguisey family bloodline for years, but Pistachio has been kept ignorant about it for a quarter century (no explaination is given)- but one day his Grandpa breaks the news that he is a ""disguiser"" and he becomes an apprentice Master Of Disguise, Level 1 (out of 1000 levels). Wow.
As happens in movies like this, Pistachio's parents are kidnapped by the predictably villainous megalomaniac Devlin Bowman (ST:TNG's Brent Spiner), who always breaks wind after giving his predictably villainous laugh. But kidnapping isn't challenging enough; so Bowman is also out to steal the ""World's most secret treasures"" including the U.S Constitution, which aren't so secret because anyone with half a brain (!MEEEE!) will have heard of them.
MASTER OF DISGUISE is an obvious attempt to give Carvey his own AUSTIN POWERS type franchise. Could he be jealous of Mike Myer's success? Just check out Carvey's SHREK impersonation.  As subtle as a sledgehammer. He's just not funny. Ditto his Dubya- his George Senior in OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS was pretty funny, but that was then; this is now.
MASTER OF DISGUISE ought to appeal to kids under 10 (or people with an IQ 10 or under), who may appreciate the dopiness- several gags are stolen directly from BILL AND TED and ACE VENTURA. There are also unfunny digs at THE EXORCIST and JAWS.
There are better ways to kill 80 minutes: like picking lint out of your navel, tweezing your nose hairs or subjecting youself to a marathon screening of MASH re-runs. However, if you consider John Leguizamo's THE PEST to be the pinnacle of comedic brilliance then this movie is for you. If you absolutely MUST watch MOD, then look out for cameos from Bo Derek and Jesse Ventura.
Extras include commentary by the Director and Carvey, alternate & deleted scenes (They'd have been better off deleting the entire movie) introduced by Carvey in Disguisey's stupid Turtle Guy role, 3 featurettes: one an ego piece where one of the co-players describes MOD as ""WIZARD OF OZ meets ALICE IN WONDERLAND"", plus the cast and crew kissing up to Carvey and saying how brilliant he is, and finally a music video by a band you've probably never heard of, and won't care about anyway.  Not even Jennifer Esposito's beauty can partially redeem this. View at your own risk.",1058400000,2,2758,5.006535947712418
1815445,3,B00007JMEA,"This movie has two faces: that which is presented for adults, and that which is presented for children.  As an adult movie, 'Master of Disguise' has no disguise; this movie ranks with 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' as one of the worst movies ever.  The jokes are weak and childish.  The plot is a stinker.  Even the movie's weak attempts at insider jokes and satire are weak, at best.  There is a brief scene that's supposed to be homage to 'The Exorcist,' and yet there is no humor in it.  The 'Jaws' homage is likely the homage that works the best, and even it is weak.  Adults will find this movie tedious and boring, and often obnoxious.
Children, on the other hand, seem to love this movie.  Apparently there is something about the humor that they get, and we do not.  While I was bored with the turtle scene, as an example, children seem to find it hilarious.  I admit, I've tried to understand the humor in this scene, and still do not understand it, but children seem to find it very funny.  Let your child between the ages of about 4 or 5 years old and about 10 watch this movie and compare their reaction to yours.
While I did not care for this movie, there were two actors that I thought performed well.  Harold Gould as Grandfather Disguisey played the part just as I thought he should, and did the part well.  Jennifer Esposito was excellent as Jennifer Baker, and several of her lines at least made me smile rather than groan.  In many cases the puzzled, sometimes tolerant expression on her face matched my own.  I believe Jennifer was able to rise above her role and the circumstances to provide the one shining point in this movie, at least for us adults.
For adults, I rate this movie 2 stars.  For children, I rate this movie 4 stars.  Averaged out the movie gets three stars, but that's being generous for any viewer over the age of ten.",1054771200,,1852,4.4

Not since ""Not Another Teen Movie"" have I yearned for coherency and flow so much. The film's humor isn't offensive, but it may as well be. ""The Master of Disguise"" is so devoid of laughs that it hurts trying to pretend it's a comedy. For the record, Dana Carvey is funny. There are even parts in this film where he is funny, but these are in short spurts and come off as only hints to just how much of a laugh riot he can be. In other words, his talent is wasted. I can't really describe the plot, because it was too simple and insipid to really understand. No two scenes make any sense or have any continuity with each other. Many of them have Carvey speaking in a ridiculously annoying voice. The main character in this film makes Jar Jar Binks look like Hamlet by comparison. Brent Spiner looks embarrassed to be the bad guy in this film. I hope he was paid a lot, because this role was the worst possible character he could have ever played. I wish they got someone else to do it, because Spiner's reputation is tarnished with this movie. I know a few children that like this movie, but I just don't understand why. Sure it has a PG rating, but this is because the film's ""obsene"" humor never rises above fart jokes. Speaking of which, never before in any movie has a fart noise seemed so unfunny and so desperate for a laugh. Seriously, bathroom humor is easy to make funny. This movie goes out of its way to make it unfunny. I'm probably wasting my time here, but it's just because I can't bear the thought of one more person seeing this movie.

Well I've never had my lowest expectations for a movie cut under like this ever before. Without a doubt,this is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting and storyline were completely ridiculous--and not in the funny way either. People say that this filmed was aimed at kids...yeah, like a gunshot to the head. No kid I know enjoyed this movie in the least.
Dana Carvey tries to pull off this awful story and fails miserably. There are running gags that are infuriating and depressing, and not funny at all. I laughed more in ""Schindler's List"".
Before I saw this, I thought I'd already seen the worst movie ever made, but oh boy was I wrong. The trailers for this film were obviously the ""best"" scenes in the film, because everything else was completely devoid of sense, reason, creativity, and humor. And it's only an hour and fifteen minutes long!!
To top it off, there are deleted/alternate scenes on this DVD. Obviously not cut for the fear of running time, these scenes are each introduced by the stupid and annoying ""Turtle Guy"". These are the scenes that weren't ""good enough"" for the movie??!!?? I want a day back for each of the minutes I spent watching this stupid waste of time and money. It is a black hole of stupidity, sucking away all talent and humor and realism into a void from whence it can NEVER EVER be retrieved.

We typically only spend the requisite $... on a movie we know we'll all like, and this one was getting dismal reviews, so we passed until it was on DVD.  I picked this up last night when I was getting a movie for my husband and I, much to our 5 year old's joy.  We put the DVD in and puttered around the house as he watched it.  I don't think a minute went by that he didn't laugh out loud, sometimes just in a constant belly laugh.  I guess that could be a problem if you were aiming to entertain 20+ years old, but this is a great movie for kids.  The profanity is mild to say the most, and this is the first movie we've actually enjoyed as a family in a long time.  This is a rarity these days!

Dana Carvey plays a stereotyped parody of a guy from an Italian family famous for the art of disguise.  His name is Pistachio Disguisi (get it - DISGUISE-i, get it????), which will give you an idea of the level of humor involved.  Over the course of this endless movie, he becomes, among other things, a turtle, a cherry pie, and George W. Bush.
My 8-year-old laughed; maybe your kids will too; thus the two-star rating (based on my opinion alone it would be a 1-star movie).  But I would be surprised if anyone of voting age even cracked a smile.",1044316800,6,648,4.428571428571429
1815491,1,B00007JMEA,"Dana Carvey's latest movie is THE MASTER OF DISGUISE. A fantasy plot insues in which Carvey's character has the ability to transform himself into anyone he wants to, right down to their voice and actions. This is a family secret that his parents tried to keep from him. So of course there is some ridiculous, childish comedy which ensues during the movie. Some of which is laughable, but perhaps the funniest thing about the movie is how bad the script and plot is. This is just your typical run of dime movie with the girl he ends up with at the end and ridiculous humor. Might appeal to some, but not for me.",1044057600,2,610,4.407079646017699

That said, the movie also has some hilarious bits that will fly right by children. The Al Pacino ""Scarface"" character is a scream and dead-on accurate. I went into this movie with low expectations and ended up laughing out loud through the whole thing. It isn't sophisticated, the ""Pistachio"" character is often a little too sappy, and some of the characters (Pistachio's mother) seemed miscast, but overall I enjoyed this movie and will surely watch it again (given how much my daughter loves it). Note to Dads: if the slapstick comedy doesn't keep you interested, Jennifer Esposito will. Major babeage!

1815514,5,B00007JMEA,"""Master of Disguise"" is not a GREAT MOVIE.
I understand if people don't like it.
It is surreal and you never know what is going to happen in the very next minute.
It is ridiculous, confusing, fast paced, downright stupid, and childish.

These are the things that made me love it.

Dana Carvey has made a crazy movie for kids who love absurd humour.
If you remember making up stories with your siblings or friends, stories that made you shoot milk out your collective noses - but made your parents roll their eyes because you were ""acting silly"" - then you will understand ""Master of Disguise"".

I can't remember the last time I laughed this hard in a movie theatre. I couldn't breathe at certain points. I should warn you, in a theatre full of kids and adults I was 1 of only 3 people laughing. (No, I wasn't stoned or drunk).

This is a movie made with Dana's kids in mind.
I enjoyed it as if I was 7 years old again.
I hope this movie has a long life on video.

I don't know the script came from and who thought it was even remotely funny.  Some gags just go on for much too long - I never found the turtle man to be in any way funny, but for some reason this just goes on and on and on.
To see the best of Carvey, get a copy of him on the ""SNL Best Of"" series and just pretend this movie never happened.

It is his first movie since 1994's ""Clean Slate"" and a bout with cancer, and he proved that he can still have fun that he loves to make others laugh.",1031788800,2,416,4.845070422535211

I'd have to say all the reviewers missed the point of this movie. It's a wonderful movie for the right audience; kids about 12 and under. I guess that many people see Dana Carvey's name and expect to find a movie targeted to the Wayne's World/ Austin Powers demographic but that simply is not the case. The kids were laughing out loud many times during the movie and the end credits. The story is easy enough to follow, the humor in not too cruel or scatological, and the jokes are right up a kid's alley.
I think the filmmakers blew it a bit in the trailers for the flick. Too many adults went expecting this would be for them, but come to think of it, the only time I saw previews for this was during movies for kids. Dads, take your younger children and they'll have a great time. My 4 year olds favorite part was the way the evil villain kept ending his devious laugh.

1815556,1,B00007JMEA,"Dana Carvey is gone for all these years, and his comeback is this grade-z stinker? It seems like a made-for-Nickelodeon TV Movie, and a bad one at that. Carvey plays Pistachio Disguisey, the latest in a long line of Masters of Disguise. Except he's an idiot. (This sounds WAY too much like Inspector Gadget. The cartoon. Which is funnier, by the way.....) His parents (The intolerable James Brolin and the loathsome Edie McClurg) are kidnapped, and his grandfather must teach him the Disguisey secrets to get them back. The movie is really short. It just SEEMS like it's 4 hours long. And why make a movie for kids, and fill it with long segments riffing on Scarface, Jaws, The Exorcist, and a million other things they won't get? (I got them, but I didn't laugh....) The interminably long outtakes seem to hint that there were whole scenes that were cut out, so I should be thankful for that; It could have been even worse.

1815557,1,B00007JMEA,"""The Master of Disguise"" raises - and indeed answers - the question of whether or not it is possible for a movie that bills itself as a ""comedy"" to run from beginning to end without offering a single funny moment.  (The answer, by the way, is, yes, it can be done).  Thus, while his ""Wayne's World"" partner, Mike Myers, is out there making both a fortune and an indelible impression on pop culture with his ""Austin Powers"" franchise, poor Dana Carvey is reduced to appearing in disastrous vehicles like this one.  Now don't get me wrong.  I love Carvey's work on ""Saturday Night Live,"" especially his impersonations of many of the major political figures of our time.  However, Carvey's manic, over-the-top style is, apparently, a whole lot easier to take in small doses.  Watching him mug, cavort and pratfall his way through a laughless script for the better part of an hour and a half ultimately becomes as wearying as it is embarrassing to watch.
Stealing much of its concept from ""The Mask,"" ""The Master of Disguise"" involves Carvey in some nonsense about a family of crime fighters who are able to magically don all sorts of disguises at a moment's notice.  This allows the filmmakers to enlist the aid of a number of real life celebrities who end up making cameo appearances, in the misguided belief, most likely, that this was going to be a fun, entertaining movie comedy.  Boy, were they misled.  Actually, I have rarely seen a film in which the jokes, ""bits"" and setups fall as consistently flat as they do here.  To get a general notion of the level of humor in this film, please note that the running gag involves one character's tendency towards uncontrollable flatulence.  It isn't funny the first time it happens and, believe me, it is even less funny the fourth, fifth (or is it sixth?) time around.
In addition to the celebrity walk-ons (Bo Derek, Jesse Ventura, Paula Abdul, among others), Harold Gould, James Brolin, Jennifer Espinoto, Brent Spiner and Edie McClurg are all good sports who deserve better material than what they have been handed here.  So is Carvey when you come right down to it.  But then Carvey wrote the screenplay, so he HAS to be a good sport about it.  After all, he handed HIMSELF this material.  I hope the other actors trapped in this mess at least got paid well for their endeavors.
The only good news is that, in the closing credits, we get to see many of the scenes, lines and characters that were, apparently, filmed, then dropped from the final product.  One can only imagine how much worse the film would have been had they all been allowed to stay in.",1029369600,,2604,4.652838427947598
1815558,3,B00007JMEA,"Master Of Disguise is the return on Dana Carvey and he is back! This movie has several very funny gags and bits and I really think the standout performance in this film is done by Brent Spiner (Cmdr. Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation) who plays the evil villain and nemesis of the Disguise family.
The premise is simple and could have used a little punching up in the story here and there but overall the movie has so many gags it moves forward pretty quickly. Even through the end credits - so don't leave when the movie is over. There are even some out-takes and I love those.
The movie is filled with guest appearances like Bo Derrick, Ben Johnson, Jessica Simpson and Jesse Ventura whom were all playing themselves. Dana Carvey gives a valiant effort with all his characters and voices he does and is famous for. Especially after having some serious personal health issues. James Brolin (Mr. Barbara Striesand) and Eddie McClerg (Ferris Buelers Day Off) play his Italian parents and they look like they are having a great time.
The movie is a fun lark and has a lot of personality, however a little short in the story department - most of the gags and Brent's performance make up for it. This is no Austin Powers. (See my Austin Powers reviews.) I think the DVD release will be something to look out for. You'll enjoy this if you have some time to spare. 8-6-02",1028592000,3,1372,4.514056224899599
