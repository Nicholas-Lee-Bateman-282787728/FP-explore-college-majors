Most of the principles of classical conservativism are argued with much more perspective and insight in (I hate to say it) more serious books, I would suggest starting with Nozick and trying to piece that together.  There is mass confusion about ""liberalism"", ""conservatism"", ""rightism"", and ""leftism"", especially in North America.  There seems to be an entire industry of books from ""right wing"" and ""left wing"" political sycophants who try and form coherent ideologies by piecing together what they hate and creating an evildoer who can embody it.  But as Rush Limbaugh reminds us, this polarized fantasy land ends up reading like a tedious and poorly argued smear campaign.  Do not judge conservatism (or liberalism for that matter) based on what ""Rush Limbaugh"" says....I should hope that you already knew that.",1087776000,2,924,5.174496644295302
