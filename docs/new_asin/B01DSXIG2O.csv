7723916,2,B01DSXIG2O,"Justin (Taran Killam) gets publicly dumped and humiliated by his now ex-girlfriend Sarah (Aimee-Lynn Chadwick). His workmates help him out with an Internet date called ""Casual Encounters."" He works for Cal Telcom, pronounce Telecom. Justin has the proverbial female office mate (Brooklyn Decker) that has an interest in him....Internet dates show up in real life etc. formula, barf writing.

We know how this turns out 5 minutes into the film. The predictability factor was extremely high, Justin's sad sack character not likeable. Not worthy of a date night film.
