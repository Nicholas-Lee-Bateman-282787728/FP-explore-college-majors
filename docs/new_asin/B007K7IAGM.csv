5092529,5,B007K7IAGM,"I knew Lisa Kudrow could be funny. I just didn't know she could be THIS funny. This particular show just struck a chord with me, and I laughed out loud through every episode. It WAS therapy--in the truest sense. The humor is very dry. If you enjoy slapstick or silliness, you won't like it at all. But if you enjoy the humor that emerges from everyday life gone wrong (sometimes horribly wrong), this is just your kind of show. What's particularly remarkable is that most of it takes place in a cubicle--Lisa's online office. Now that takes some genius. Think Seinfeld or Larry David, but a little edgier. Truth be told, Lisa Kudrow can say more with her facial expressions alone than most so-called comics can say in a 10-minute routine. The guest stars are wonderful, too--Lily Tomlin (how she kept a straight face I'll never know) and Julia Louis Dreyfus stand out in my mind. Sheer unadulterated fun that for a short, blessed while, takes your mind off demonically depressing politics--and just about everything else. This is a refreshing departure from the usual let's-put-everyone-down kind of comedy that seems to have overtaken prime time television AND late-night shows. Makes a terrific gift for someone who could use a genuinely hearty laugh (yourself, perhaps). Unlike most sit-coms, this one is actually funny.",1359849600,8,1323,4.963963963963964
5092530,1,B007K7IAGM,How do I get my money returned for this crap. I'm glad I only bought the first episode. I deleted it half way through thats how bad it was!,1358985600,,139,3.8275862068965516
5092531,5,B007K7IAGM,"...I didn't find this hit-or-miss at all.  I laughed uproariously at every episode.  Fiona's outrageous self-absorption is hilarious, but it's particularly fun to watch her get hoisted by her own petard.  Jennifer Elise Cox (whom you might remember as Jan in the Brady Bunch movies) is a stand-out in her guest spots.  Highly recommended.",1357689600,,338,5.203703703703703
5092532,5,B007K7IAGM,"Season 2 is much funnier, but I'm glad I viewed Series 1 for background, which gave me a little more insight into Series 2.  Web therapy is very funny, with excellent plots and twists and turns.  The actors and the acting are phenomenal.  Lisa Kudrow plays a narcissistic character who puts on a brave face for the world, but her vulnerability shines through, adding to the complexity of her character.

With all the crap on TV today, I was so happy to find this series, with excellent writers, actors, plots, and the wonderful characters portrayed.

This series is not for people who watch reality TV.  This show is for people who like to watch actors being allowed to be the artists they truly are.",1352764800,,700,4.604838709677419
5092533,5,B007K7IAGM,This is one of the funniest shows out there.  Lisa Kudrow shows her immense ability to play a character different from but in some ways like Phoebe.  I love that the show is not scripted.  It makes for some very funny interactions with the characters.  Lily Tomlin as her mother is a riot!,1348185600,11,289,4.39622641509434
5092534,5,B007K7IAGM,"This show is mainly improv, so I find it funnier than scripted.  It has a wide range of special guests that make appearances.  It's a very sarcastic show and can be dry also, but I find it works quite well with the format of ""skype"" calls.",1347148800,3,239,4.173913043478261
5092535,5,B007K7IAGM,"Web Therapy is my new favorite tv show!  I just discovered it and am catching up on old episodes.  Lisa Kudrow plays a ""web therapist"" who counsels her patients for three minutes online.  There are many, many great guest stars.  You never know who will appear next - Meryl Streep, Lilly Tomlin, Jane Lynch, Rosie O'Donnell to name a few. I can't get enough of it.",1346112000,3,363,4.454545454545454
5092536,1,B007K7IAGM,On video but she is kinda dumb. Didnt learn anything except hot chicks are not too brite enuf said here,1345507200,,103,4.2
5092537,5,B007K7IAGM,"So I was very excited to see this on DVD and I didn't even know Lisa Kudrow had a new show. So I purchased this in store and I got all the way up to episode 5 on disc one and about half way through, it froze, and then skipped ahead almost 10 minutes. I returned it for another and the new second set skipped in the same place on the same disc. There has to be a manufacturing error. Other than that, I love this show and can't wait to see season 2.",1340496000,3,448,3.776595744680851
5092538,4,B007K7IAGM,"Another Amazon reviewer has really nailed this show by designating it as hit or miss.  This is a scathing satire and Kudrow either really nails it or not.  She hits more than she misses though and comedy is a tough gig so on balance, it is worth a viewer's time.  She plays a web therapist, someone who is going to have a short internet web therapy experience with a patient and cure their problem with this short, intensive approach.  She is meant to be unqualified right from the very first episode when we are given her very iffy qualifications as a therapist.

Part of the hit and miss nature comes from the fact she uses guest stars. If the guest star is great, she is great.  So when Jane Lynch from GLEE, for example, guests, it is a great episode. There are episodes involving her mother, Lily Tomlin, which are also first rate.

I think this is worth a viewer's time to at least try it out.

5092574,5,B007K7IAGM,"...but I don't typically recommend it to anyone. It's definitely not for everyone. Fiona Wallace is hilarious, and Lisa Kudrow plays her perfectly. That voice!!! And I love the guest stars.

Can't wait for season 3 to come out on DVD, and I'll be watching season 4 this year.",1404432000,,275,4.612244897959184
5092575,5,B007K7IAGM,"My husband saw an episode of Web Therapy on an airplane.  He told me how good it is.  So, I ordered both seasons and I have not been disappointed.  So incredibly silly.  And her acting is brilliant.  It's very hard to act a part like hers that seems mostly normal, but a little ""off"".  Her kooky character on ""Friends"" would have been much easier from an acting point of view.  The subtle character flaws are very hard to act convincingly.

If you want belly laughs, this series probably isn't for you.  But, if you like more subtle and silly humor; and enjoy watching a master
of acting act.  You should enjoy this.",1404086400,,616,4.419642857142857
5092576,5,B007K7IAGM,"This show is so funny and so snarky! Lisa Kudrow is hilarious and the supporting cast, including Lily Tomlin, is great. There are often guest appearances by other famous celebrities.",1403654400,,182,5.1
5092577,1,B007K7IAGM,"A little Kudrow goes a long way as it did in ""Friends""...except in Friends, she was toned down by the other ones and that made the whole show funny and good.  But even the premise of this show is silly.  We bought one episode to try it, glad we didn't spend the $$ on the whole 2 seasons.  We turned it off about half way through.",1401667200,,330,3.9696969696969697
5092578,4,B007K7IAGM,Anything with Lisa Kudrow makes me laugh.  Her comedic timing is wonderful. I'm looking forward to the next season arriving in my mailbox.,1397952000,,138,5.0
5092579,4,B007K7IAGM,"I bought the first season of Web Therapy and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Lisa Kudrow plays a very sophisticated therapist who gets an idea to provide three minute therapy sessions via the web.  Throughout the sessions, you learn a lot about her character.  This show was cleverly done and I got the feeling that a lot of it was improvised.",1397433600,,335,4.6440677966101696
5092580,5,B007K7IAGM,"This show is outstanding. Fiona Wallace is like a modern more fantastic, female Frasier Crane. Self absorbed and able to boost your confidence by watching her act her way through each session.",1396396800,,192,5.03125
5092581,5,B007K7IAGM,I'm a big Lisa Kudrow fan. This is a fun show. If you like Lisa I think you'll like Web Therapy.,1392076800,,96,3.619047619047619
5092582,5,B007K7IAGM,"If you haven't seen it, you should.  Lisa Kudrow is priceless, and her co-stars and guest cast are amazing! (And if you missed Lisa on a recent episode of ""Scandal"", you should check it out.  Looks she's quite good at drama too.",1389916800,,228,4.404761904761905
5092583,5,B007K7IAGM,"great series.  Bought this as a gift for a friend recuperating.  Laughter is the best medicine (Therapy).  I have found that people either get this show or not.  The humor is subtle and dense. Each time I watch it ( I think it is that good, to be able to watch it more than once) I find new jokes that I missed the first time around.  Loads of guest stars: lily Tomlin, Rosie O'Don. (sos) etc.",1387497600,,393,4.118421052631579
5092584,5,B007K7IAGM,"This show is absolutely hilarious! After a few episodes Lisa Kudrow really slips into her character - her best since Valerie Cherish on ""The Comeback"" an the guest stars are unbeatable. Spread the word - Web Therapy is an under the radar gem.",1386201600,,242,4.651162790697675
5092585,5,B007K7IAGM,"Lisa Kudrow is an acquired taste.  Her humor is definitely not for everyone.  I think either you truly enjoy her or you don't.  I was never really a ""Friends"" fan, but I loved Lisa in ""The Comeback"" and wanted more.  Luckily, I stumbled upon this and enjoyed it.  She always seems to play a brilliant narcissus and in this interesting series she climbs that mountain of ego mania.  When I watched the first episode, I realized that she plays a therapist who insists on conducting a 3 minute therapy session for each client via webcam or Skype.  I thought that this might get old pretty quickly, but I was fascinated and entertained that I had to watch another episode and then another.  Soon I was hooked.  Her character is so full of herself and so arrogant, she always manages to make the session about her.  Her little nuances and facial expressions I couldn't get enough of.  I found this highly entertaining.  But as I said, Kudrow is an acquired taste and this main character is not likable, so some may love this, others might not.  I personally loved this.  Now I'm gonna watch Season 2.",1384128000,3,1095,4.5487179487179485
5092586,3,B007K7IAGM,I only watched one Episode.  Kudrow and cast are ok... but just a little too dumb for my taste.  I don't think I'll watch more.,1383004800,,127,4.04
5092587,5,B007K7IAGM,"i loved this brilliant series , it takes time and concentration as it is delightfully layered and complex , but it is well worth the effort , some absolutely hysterical and scathing guest star performances",1381622400,2,205,4.885714285714286
5092588,1,B007K7IAGM,"Really did not like. I watched part of episoide 1 and quit wating. Tried another episode and quit that one also. Would like to return season 1, but we cannot as it is used. It is strange and returned season two which we also bought.",1381449600,,232,4.177777777777778
5092589,3,B007K7IAGM,"Had higher expectations for this show.  Will continue to watch but not as excited about it.  Characters are interesting
But not always funny.",1380844800,,141,5.086956521739131
5092590,5,B007K7IAGM,"Lisa Kudrow is a master -- the way she captures the utter narcissism of Fiona, and the obviously spontaneous improvs she does with her brilliant guests -- this is a treasure.  I can't get enough of it.",1380412800,3,201,4.4324324324324325
5092591,3,B007K7IAGM,"I loved Lisa Kudrow in ""Friends"" and looked forward to her in this well-regarded show. But her character in this show is so unpleasantly clueless and potentially harmful to others (fictionally) that I don't enjoy it. The humor is lost on me.",1380412800,,241,4.761904761904762
5092592,1,B007K7IAGM,"Could not get halfway through this.  Boring and dumb. It was just sensless. The jokes were mindless.  So sad, I wanted to like it.",1379548800,,130,4.375
5092593,3,B007K7IAGM,"I have only watched a few episodes, and perhaps it will get better, but I have had a hard time sticking with it.  The whole concept sounds hilarious, and Lisa Kudrow is definitely hilarious as are the other actors, but it just falls very flat, not too entertaining, and sort of boring.  :(  I'm sorry, because I really want to like this show.",1377734400,,342,4.396825396825397
5092594,5,B007K7IAGM,A fresh take on therapy and the dysfunctional family.  Love Lisa Kudrow in this unique comedy.  I hope Showtime keeps the seasons coming!!,1376092800,,138,4.956521739130435
5092595,3,B007K7IAGM,"Seems improvisational , and the actors are brilliant and hilarious .  The premise is a gem. Lisa Kudrow can be a bit edgy and get on your nerves. You have to be in the right mood.",1375833600,,179,3.9722222222222223

8518731,5,B007K7IAGM,"I am so excited to see this show on Amazon. I used to watch it when it was just a ten minute web series so putting the episodes together for a half hour show is great! Every season it gets better and I love Stephen Webber as her old boss, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as her sister and Lilly Tomlinson as her insane mother. The fact that she refuses to acknowledge that she has an awful marriage because her husband is gay is also a funny addition. Highly recommended. By the way, some Friends cast members make excellent appearances as patients too!",1479686400,2,542,4.43

I cannot wait to buy season 3 the minute it becomes available on Amazon Prime. If you just want enjoy the show with so much entertainment value and so many guest stars I highly recommend you watch Web Therapy. It might just be my new favorite show.,1470787200,,390,4.213333333333333
8518736,5,B007K7IAGM,"Silly, goofy fun. This series takes a little getting used to the format. I was not an initial big fan of Kudrow but saw all the star cameos on the show and decided to give it a try. Now, she has me hooked. She surprised me. It is witty show with lots of off-color humor and gay topics. It was an odd concept, but it works for me. The ironic thing is several years later I found myself taking therapy with a woman out of state and guess what? She used Web Therapy! I could totally relate.",1468540800,,487,4.030927835051546
