7907688,5,B00000F4Y7,"Peter Cushing even in his older age was still a great actor many can't even compare to and here does a excellent job as he did many times
as Sherlock Holmes. This one is one of the better ones with a great story that really is a mystery til the end. The quality of the VHS is quite
good and I love VHS anyway but after years of watching this I expected a DVD widescreen version to be released! I can't believe this great
movie hasn't been released with all the garbage being released on DVD today! John Mills plays a good Watson maybe one of the best ever.
If your a Holmes or mystery or Cushing movie fan you will want to add this to your collection even though only on VHS right now or ever.",1453766400,,693,4.065693430656935
7907689,4,B00000F4Y7,"In the mid 1970s Kevin Francis (son of legendary cinematographer and director Freddie Francis) made a foolhardy attempt to keep alive the old school of British horror that he had grown up with (and to which his father had made significant contributions). Unfortunately he was tilting at windmills as his company Tyburn, which had previously released Richard Burton's DOCTOR FAUSTUS in 1967, did not have the financial resources, nor the distribution capabilities, and ultimately the audience to make his grand scheme work. In 1975 they made three films (LEGEND OF THE WEREWOLF, THE GHOUL, PERSECUTION) before retreating into television where they kept a very low profile. In 1984 they once more rose to the occasion by giving Peter Cushing one last meaty role to close out his career on. It was a role that he had played 25 years earlier in Hammer's HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES. That role, of course, was Sherlock Holmes.

Cushing was 70 years old when shooting on the film began and once more the game was afoot. Tyburn surrounded him with several old friends and top flight talent so that THE MASKS OF DEATH would be a grand sendoff. His old Hammer compatriots actor Anton Diffring and director Roy Ward Baker were there and Tyburn recruited Ray Milland and Anne Baxter from America to enrich the proceedings. The biggest coup however was getting John Mills to play Dr. Watson. Picking up where Andre Morell had left off in HOUND (Morell died in 1978), Mills is the perfect Watson...intelligent, trustworthy, and devoted to his friend. There is a great chemistry there which enhances their scenes together and it helps to make MASKS one of the better Holmes offerings especially for a film that is a TV movie complete with blackouts. What it lacks due to budgetary restrictions is more than made up for by watching these old pros in action.

The film opens in 1926 with an aged Watson hiring a stenographer to set down in writing the details of a case that had been supressed by the British government for more than a decade. Cushing, his frame as thin as ever and with white hair, epitomizes Holmes with just a roll of the eyes as he urges Watson to get on with it. The bulk of the story takes place in 1913 right before the outbreak of World War I. While investigating the discovery of three bodies, their faces distorted horribly (hence the title), Holmes is approached by the Home Secretary (Milland) and a German aristocrat (Diffring) to drop that case and find a missing member of German royalty. This leads Holmes & Watson in many directions for there is more going on than meets the eye. To say anything else would be criminal except that Warner Brothers, who released this VHS, should release it on Archive DVD as soon as possible.",1382659200,2,2740,4.754201680672269
7907690,3,B00000F4Y7,"A very fine pastiche of the Holmes mythology.  It is long past time for a Region 1 DVD, where is it?",1382400000,,100,3.761904761904762
7907691,4,B00000F4Y7,"I was uncertain if I would like this film because of Cushings age at the time, because I didn't really care for Biggles, which was Cushings last movie. This film starts off kinda slow, but you gotta build the story and characters. Once the plot and characters are set up the movie makes a turn for the better and becomes much fun. My favorite parts of the movie are when Peter Cushing dresses up in funny disguises and when he's going crazy and firing a gun all over the place. It's funny because I don't think I recall him ever firing a gun in any other film except The Satanic Rites of Dracula, but that's one shot and he misses. There is some good explosions too. John Mills plays a great Dr. Watson in his later years, and Anton Diffring of course the guy you can't really trust. I didn't think I would like this film because the reviews weren't that great, but I watched it, and loved it. So buy this movie and you will like it, especially if you like Sherlock Holmes tales.",1344902400,,979,4.297297297297297
7907692,5,B00000F4Y7,"This is among the most satisfying Holmes-Watson films.

Brett's hamminess is fun, unlike the scenery-eating sonorities of Williamson, Plummer, et. al.  But Cushing shares Rathbone's ability to convey the rapier intelligence of Holmes as intrinsic, ""matter-of-fact brilliance.""

And fondness for Bruce's Watson suggests that many subsequent Watsons have either been stodgily underplayed (which is fine) or else ""enriched"" with personal embellishments (notably Mason's engaging but speciously enhanced characterization in MURDER BY DECREE).

Indeed it is comparison to MURDER BY DECREE that enables one to appreciate the superiority of MASKS OF DEATH.  Mills's Watson achieves audience appreciation by playing him as neither a buffoon nor a drab social-class-bound observer.  His recurring bit about Holmes's fingers provides a subtle indicator of their relationship.

Except for fade-outs for presumed commercial breaks, every aspect of the physical production is superior to DECREE.  The narrative covers virtually all the bases (violin, cap & pipe, disguises, Mrs. Hudson, but not the drug addiction) with straightforward respect and skill.

One disappointment is Anne Baxter as ""the woman,"" since she doesn't convey requisite complexity and intelligence for Irene Adler.  A glamorous older actress with the steely subtlety of Joan Hickson (especially in a tea room scene with Miss Bunner in A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED) would have made the potential nemesis much more interesting.

In sum, this version of the immortal franchise makes me want to see many more Cushing performances--preferably those not ""Hammered"" with faux ghoulishness.",1157932800,4,1633,5.819327731092437
7907693,4,B00000F4Y7,"This is an odd little TV film that is certainly ""small potatoes"" in the grand list of Sherlock Holmes films. But I seem to come back to it again and again. First, Peter Cushing is one of my very favorite Holmeses, and even as feeble as he is in this 1984 movie, he charms. Second, John Mills serves as a delightful older Watson, and his portrayal ranks right up there with that of James Mason in the marvelous MURDER BY DECREE. And despite quite a few problems with its canonicity, MASKS OF DEATH is clever fun. Now, if only it would become available on DVD (my VHS copy is wearing thin).",1102723200,6,588,4.306306306306307
7907694,4,B00000F4Y7,"Not really based on Doyle, but Holmes does come out of retirement to foil a German plot in 1913.  The plot itself is only fair, but Cushing and Mills more than make up for that in their performances and teamwork.  They have the best chemistry as Holmes and Watson since Rathbone and Bruce. It's too bad failure to find financial backing and Cushing's failing health prevented any further films from being made.  The supporting cast was also good.  Gutsy casting, not one major player cast was under sixty at the time!",1081036800,3,517,4.648351648351649
7907695,4,B00000F4Y7,"Peter Cushing O.B.E. returns to the role of Sherlock Holmes 27 years after he made Hound of the Baskervilles for Hammer in 1959. An austere, civilised actor - even in his most disturbing horror roles! - Cushing pulls it off  professionally as always (despite being well past his  ""retirement""), with fine support from Sir John Mills as Dr  Watson. And well he should have - not only did Cushing make a Holmes TV  series for the BBC in the 1960s, but he was an Honorary Member of the  Sherlock Holmes Society of London. Following Masks of Death, Channel 4  tried to persuade Cushing to make another Holmes film, but sadly he was too  unwell. RIP Peter Cushing: a fine classically trained  ""Shakespearean"" actor who preferred to play Frankenstein, Dr Who,  Professor Van Helsing and Sherlock Holmes. Cool!",962323200,8,803,4.802919708029197
