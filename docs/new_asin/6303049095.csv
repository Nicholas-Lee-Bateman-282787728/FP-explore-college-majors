555164,1,6303049095,"Of the 65 minutes of this tape, you only get a 30 minute class which includes 10 minutes of meditation.  The sound quality of the class is awful, I've seen much better quality HOME videos!",950486400,3,188,4.371428571428571
555165,1,6303049095,"I get a MUCH better class at the local YMCA.  I bought this and a Buns of Steel Yoga tape at the same time.  The other tape was cheaper, had better atmosphere (nice gardens versus a delapitaded dance studio), had better  exercises, and an instructor without a distracting lisp!  At points, the  instructor is muffled from bad sound quality.  The American Yoga  Association should be ashamed of themselves for such a bad product.",949622400,21,428,4.780821917808219
555166,5,6303049095,I like this video very much because the first half shows individual yoga moves.  The second half of the video is a 30 minute class which ends with a 10-minute meditation.  Easy to follow.  I highly recommend,946512000,42,207,4.54054054054054

7836810,5,6303049095,I love this Yoga DVD! It's challenging but still relaxing. There are modifications for those who are not as flexible and it's only about 20-25 minutes. Easy to follow directions. I would recommend for someone wanting a little challenge and has a little strength already.,1481241600,,270,5.022222222222222

7836812,4,6303049095,"This is a very simple yet worthwhile yoda dvd.  I love it because in one half hour I can get in a good stretch.  I allow ten minutes to setup and the actual workout is only 20 minutes.  While Yoga officianotos may think it too little, time is always an issue and everyone can usually get a half hour to squeeze this in.  I have chronic lower back issues and if I do this dvd 3 times a week I a fine.  I purchased one for every mother in my book club!",1323129600,,450,3.847826086956522
7836813,3,6303049095,"This is definitely not a basic yoga instruction.  If you've never tried Yoga you might find a lot of what the instructors do in this video a bit difficult.  However, all yoga is supposed to be comfortable, so you can strive to get as close as you can to what you see on the screen and in a few short weeks you'll find yourself getting even closer to what it looks like on your television.  Just be warned that you should never push yourself, you can wind up stretching out your muscles to the point where it's painful to move, or worse, tearing something.  With that in mind it's still a good instructional video that uses a good set of repetition to make the work out interesting and engaging.",1314576000,3,694,4.3565891472868215
7836814,3,6303049095,"I did yoga many years ago and picked this video up at Ross. The intro is kind of decieving...I was expecting more of a workout- this is a short (maybe 15-20 minute) yoga warm up, which is pretty ideal for the advanced beginner/intermediate student.
If you are comfortable doing sun salutations on your own, you could probably skip it, however, I enjoyed the video- it's just the mellow ticket I needed before bed. Not too strenuous, not too easy. =) I just wish it had been longer.",1192579200,2,481,4.540229885057471
7836815,2,6303049095,"I wanted some basic yoga moves, stretches, and exercises that were simple, and not impossible. But I was actually unable to do most of the video. I think it is a good guide for more experienced people, but not for me.",1155168000,6,217,4.317073170731708
7836816,5,6303049095,"Yes, I agree that is very simple; but for people like me who get a gym membership and never go for more than a few weeks, its a good start.  I have bought all kind of excercise tapes, you name it, Raquel Welch (actually pretty good but Difficult - Recommend it), Fonda (to much jumping, Denise Austin (to much for me - at least at this level), so  you see my type is not easily persuaded to move.

So for people like me actual couch potatoes that want to get a gentle intro so as to slowly feel better this and any beginners pilates videos is Highly recommended.

True the bit about having to see the instructions at the begining, But... a big but as I am not in the mood every day to move it is a good remminder so as no to put myself into a wrong and/or hurtful position.",1147737600,,773,4.065789473684211
7836817,4,6303049095,"Okay, folks.  I see that most of you have dissed this tape. I don't think it warrants such a bad rap.
Buying this tape was my first try at yoga.  I appreciated the friendly, non-intimidating, not-so-spiritual way the instruction and the class is conducted.  And I like seeing the regular-looking people practice along with the instructor.  My favorite part is the relaxation and meditation at the end.  The instructor gives a very thorough relaxation sequence that I find necessary to truly reach that relaxed state.
Yes, I will give it to you that the sound quality is a bit poor and the boring dance studio setting and camera work are just that - boring; HOWEVER, it works to do what it aspires to and that is to teach basic asanas and give the beginner a short, non-intimidating class with which to work.",992131200,5,807,4.654929577464789
7836818,2,6303049095,"I was disappointed in this video.  The actual video was boring to watch and a bit simple!  ALso, the first 30 minutes are a step-by-step and then you get to the actual ""workout.""  This is a problem because you only need to see the intro once and so when you want to repeat the workout you have to be careful that you do not rewind too far.  Too much work-not a great tape.",971913600,2,372,4.054794520547945
