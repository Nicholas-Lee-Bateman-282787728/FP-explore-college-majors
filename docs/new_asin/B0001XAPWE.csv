2042253,4,B0001XAPWE,"Issues and complexity of life in western society at the turn of the 21st century are expressed very poignantly and emphatically in this Canadian-French collaboration, winner of Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and Cesar for Best French Film of 2003. Remy (Remy Girard), once a womanizing, radically socialist college teacher, is dying. His well-off, pragmatic businessman son Sebastien (Stephane Rousseau) tries to gather to his would-be deathbed all the people his father loved (or made love to) in his life.
At first sight thematically similar to father-son late reunion of Tim Burton's 2003 ""Big Fish"", director and screenwriter Denys Arcand covers a much wider spectrum of issues in ""The Barbarian Invasions"", and he does it with amazing ease and elegance. The film thus abounds with plenty of matters to think about, from money and unions, to drugs and family, to sex and religion. It does not judge his characters, but, it nevertheless doesn't try to hide there's something wrong with a world where jetliners hit skyscrapers and people must resort to euthanasia to relieve suffering of their loved ones.",1079481600,6,1113,5.188888888888889
2042254,4,B0001XAPWE,"This was a richly entertaining flick that doesn't really aspire to be much but a deathbed with dignity tale. The script is a gem, adroitly pointing out that once intelligence leaves society, it can take centuries to return. Cretinism and consumptionism have replaced intellectualism, and this pains the protagonist more than the tumors eating away at him from within. Why indeed did Pope Pius get to sit on a velvet chair while Primo Levi went to Auschwitz?
Sad and poignant, yet filled with irrascible humor, well-acted and with good pacing - make time for this one when it hits your local art-house or DVD purveyor.",1079049600,4,617,4.885714285714286
2042255,5,B0001XAPWE,"""The Barbarian Invasions"" (Les Invasions Barbares), with its' thickly-accented storyline, including a heavy emphasis on drama, not to mention a fine supporting cast, is sure to please even the most enthusiastic foreign film die-hard, for a month of Sundays on end. Suddenly stricken with the news of his father gradually and painfully dying of a terminal illness, a son (played with an exponential degree of courageousness by Stephane Rousseau) must fly from London to Montreal to be by his father's bedside during his last days. Along with running business errands for his home office via cell phone, Sebastien must comfort his father Remy (Remy Girard) through means of visual and verbal images of Remy's youthful, happier and carefree days, therefore getting his father's mind free of his difficult physical struggle. The more, the merrier, as is the case, as Remy's many friends and former co-workers join in on Remy's fond reminisces of his ""past"" (current) life, both as a publisher/writer, and as a worldly ""playboy"" of sorts. Coming to terms with his illness feels like an immaculate challenge to Remy, who, upon advice through various medical staff, refuses to seek appropriate treatment in the U.S., which would help him immensely, seeing that a certain hospital across the border has the proper equipment and facilities which would keep Remy alive longer, but due to expense (and foolish pride), Remy refuses to be put through the ringer. Through a secondary option, Sebastien learns of another way in which to keep his father on life support for an even longer period of time - through an enormous supply of heroin. This hypnotically powerful drug, although with its' use being illegal for medical purposes, Sebastien manages to locate a supplier, who has the proper connections. This particular method of use (through a form of freebasing) appears to work, but only has limited positive short-term effects for Remy, so he must have friends and family by his side continuously in order for the therapy to be of any benefit as well. Although a majority of ""The Barbarian Invasions"" was filmed in Montreal and the surrounding Quebec countryside, a little more could have been done to beef up the physical scenarios more. But, as is, the producers provided a nice touch with the lake scenery complete with a beautiful maple oak-laden wooded cottage (where Remy would ultimately spend his final days), surrounded by the finest maple trees in all of Canada, as Quebec is known for its' thick, robust maple syrup. Complete with English subtitles, not to mention a plot filled with endearing emotional subtleties by the dozens, ""Les Invasions Barbares"" is destined to become an underground favorite at art-house locales across the United States (including various other places around the globe). Want to see what all the fuss is about (with the film's smattering of Academy Award nominations and Cannes Film Festival Awards)? There's a seat with your personal name on it at a local venue near you. Oh, and you'll most definitely want a copy of ""The Barbarian Invasions"" for your video & DVD collection as well. Break out the croissants, escargot(s) and Chardonnay for this ""...Invasion"", 'cause you're gonna need 'em after fighting a war as grand as this one!",1078531200,7,3264,5.080074487895717
2042256,5,B0001XAPWE,"Few movies Ive watched proved to be as intriguing as Les invasions barbares. From the title relation with the story, to the acting and, most of all, the script, this is one of the most interesting and cynical movies Ive ever seen.
The plot is simple enough: Remy, a middle-aged french-canadian history professor, is dying. Remy has always been a ladies-man, self-minded, rude, raw. And even so, at his deathbed hes able to reunite his ex-wife, two old lovers, his son and the sons fianc, friends from school, etc. Its, indeed, a big reunion. Remy has not much time left, and he knows it.
His son is also a self-centered young millionaire who gives money as if it was water to get what he wants. Theres also a young woman, daughter of one of Remys ex-lover, who is a heroin addicted. Every character has an internal conflict; every dialogue has a deeper meaning, and most of the times this meaning is very hard to grasp without thought. In fact, there are many memorable lines and situations in this movie. Acting is perfect, from all actors, but Remy Girard and Marie Josee Croze are outstanding. This is that kind of movie that deserves to be watched more than once, in order to be fully appreciated.
But whats fantastic about Les invasions barbares is the cynical approach the director Denys Arcand has given to the script. Ill give two examples. First, the young woman who is addicted to heroine is also the person who provides Remy with the drug so he can have a lighter passing. And, in the end, she, the druggie, takes the place of Remys daughter, who is trapped in a boat in New Zealand and won't see him bofore his death. Second, the ending is as cheesy as can be. But this is done purposefully. Denys Arcand knows the ending of his movie is cheesy, and his direction in the final scenes is the most conventional  possible. He knows the viewers cant help but being moved to tears, and hes laughing at them all the time.
This cynicism, the fast and intelligent dialogues, the strange and conventional easyness of the movie is what makes it great. Sincerely, to me Les invasions barbares was a surprise. A very good one.

2042257,2,B0001XAPWE,"I saw the film and in the end I felt kind of disappointed. I am no sure what kind of message the film wanted to bring to us. It just did not impress me. I also can't understand how the moviemaker tried to, hatefully,  demolish the Canadian Health Care System without proposing anything in its place. Very destructive. I bet the US health corporations will love the film since for years they have been trying to demoralize the Canadian Health Care in frequent and expensive TV adds. I even wonder if they have something to do with the film...",1070668800,6,541,4.4646464646464645
2042258,4,B0001XAPWE,"Remy Girard is a sarcastic, portly, middle-aged-man, dying of cancer in an over-crowded Montreal hospital: seemingly a victim of his own rancid bile and Canada's medical/health system. But whereas most men in his predicament would have no one around who cares enough to visit, Remy has family, ex-wives, ex-mistresses and school friends who love and care for him and who gather around him to bid him a fond farewell. And therein lies the dichotomy of Denys Arcand's ""Les Invasions Barbares"": a bilious, learned, opinionated man and professor who has somehow miraculously touched the lives of many of those around him; who are there for him when he needs them.
What is so rich about this film is that all of the supporting characters have such particular and vivid lives and Arcand makes it a point to stop and examine them ever so briefly yet succinctly. These are not stock characters but fully developed people with the imprimatur of humanity and emotionality. And though Arcand doesn't have much time or many scenes to make these lives real, he does so with just the right amount of incisive screen time.
""Les Invasions Barbares"" is not only a family story though; it is also an indictment of Canada's Health System and its Unions. Remy's wealthy son Sebastien is able to secure a private room for Remy through bribery of not only the Union Hospital workers but of its Administrators as well (""We're not in the Third World"" she says as she greedily eyes the cash). This is played for comedy but it also has the sting of reality and social commentary.
""Les Invasions Barbares"" is ultimately about Remy's life, how he has led it and how he deals with the consequences of his actions. He's at St. Peter's door and now he must qualify as well as quantify his long life. All told, Remy comes out a winner because, despite his crusty exterior, he loved and was loved. And that pretty much makes him a winner in anyone's book.",1069372800,10,1922,4.723214285714286
2042259,5,B0001XAPWE,"Infrequently, if at all, does a film for general release revolve around normal, natural death, i.e. one not brought on by fanged space aliens, world-renting cataclysms, wild gunfights, or some other Tinseltown special FX. Hollywood script writers should walk though any cemetery sometime. Not since the 2001 tour de force, WIT, starring Emma Thompson, has the topic been intelligently portrayed. Now comes THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS, a powerful French Canadian film of albeit misleading title.
London investor Sebastien (Stephane Rousseau) is summoned home to Quebec by his mother, Louise (Dorothee Berryman) to attend the approaching death of his father, Remy (Remy Girard). Father and son have been long estranged - ever since Remy and Louise divorced. Remy, an outspoken Professor of History and a self-described ""sensuous socialist"", has spent his life indulging in wine, women, song, and learned conversation. Especially women. The reunion shows little promise of succeeding, especially after a stormy shouting match in Remy's bleak hospital room that leaves the audience facetiously asking, ""That went well, don't you think?"" But, after Louise reminds her son of a paternal love long forgotten, then filial duty and guilt compel Sebastien to use his considerable wealth to arrange an easier transition for Old Dad by improving the conditions of his hospitalization, and to gather around his treasured friends, colleagues, and mistresses.
The ""star"" is Remy, who, at the end of his life, contemplates and comes to accept the final sum of it. This exercise would be thought-provoking enough in itself, but writer/director Denys Arcand also interweaves into the plot such prickly subjects as socialized medicine, euthanasia, and the use of illegal drugs to ease terminal medical conditions. About universal health care as practiced in Canada, in the bureaucratic, union-controlled, and overcrowded web of which he is now entangled, Remy stubbornly rants that since he voted for it, he certainly wasn't going to run off to the United States for something less squalid.
Every role in this Cannes Film Festival award-winner is excellently played. Best Actress went to Marie-Josee Croze as Nathalie, the heroin-addicted daughter of one of Remy's ex-mistresses, who is recruited by Sebastien to obtain the banned substance to ease his father's suffering. Remy's lust for life has a profound effect on the young woman.
THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS is a film to be viewed by everyone who'll one day die. Unfortunately, the majority of moviegoers will stay away, opting instead for the mindless bread-and-circus fare habitually doled out into the cinematic trough by the major studios. Shame!
The last twenty or so minutes of the film, which are set at a lakeside cabin, contain some of the most poignant and emotionally powerful moments I've seen recently on the Big Screen. Lucky is the person who can say to those gathered around his/her deathbed:
""Sharing with you this modest life has been a delight"".

And yet to me it is one of a few of perfect films: The pacing, the father-son dyad, the underside of young married life (This i missed until I totally got it, beautiful how the heroin dealer and the son love.

It is I suppose a sad story but o what richness. Rare to find a film of people talking with such originality. About politics and specifically about why and when great intelligence blossoms.

By the by, for me Marie Cruze stole the film, along with the son. The flip side special features is both great and seriously problematic. The actors are having drinks at a lovely location and talking of their own lives. Very glad I've watched that but as they drink a lot, the point is less rational than inappapropriate, verging on narcissim. I am glad I watched it, but the film is the winner here.

This is a film about a man on his death-bed, a man with a teaching background,  leftist views, and an unabashed womanizer.  His wealthy son makes sure that his last days are as comfortable as possible and pays - across the table or under it - for these last amenities.  No one is depicted in a bad light in this remarkable film.  Friends come and go, ideas are exchanged, a life winds down.  All of this sounds rather hollow on paper but the film lives and breathes all by itself. Although there are a couple of hilarious exchanges in French - plays on words - that defy translation into subtitles, the film is translated beautifully.

2042288,4,B0001XAPWE,"I went into Denys Arcand's 2003 sequel to his 1986 30something story THE DECLINE OF THE AMERICAN EMPIRE pretty cold. Not only had I not seen the original film, I'd forgotten that there was a sequel and that this was it. I usually don't end up making that kind of ""mistake"", but hey it was on sale and I was in the mood for something French (well, Quebecois). I suspect that it would have helped me enjoy this more, particularly in the beginning, had I known the characters - particularly Rmy (Rmy Girard), the cancer-stricken and dying professor around whom the plot revolves - but no use crying over spilt milk. And I suppose it will now make the earlier film interesting in ways that it wouldn't have been otherwise.

As I said, Rmy is dying. He's apparently an old curmudgeon, with nobody but his ex-wife Louise (Dorothe Berryman) around to comfort him in his unpleasant government-rationed hospital bed (there are lots of early jabs at the Canadian healthcare system, and seeming admiration for American capitalism - but these elements don't really continue through the whole film - or at least they become muted). With some difficulty she convinces estranged son Sbastien (Stphane Rousseau), a high-profile businessman in London, to come back to Montreal to visit before the inevitable end. Despite the gruffness, even open hostility, with which the two men greet each other, Stphane surprisingly not only ends up prolonging his visit but arranging for a special room and eventually procuring heroin to ease his father's pain.

I didn't really buy it. Not at first. It seems like Stphane has a change of heart with no real explanation - does he suddenly see the vulnerable, needy side of his father or something? Maybe - but it just doesn't come across very well in the film. And Rmy, world-class jerk, obnoxious and abusive to begin with, quickly turns into a garrulous and entertaining center of attention once his ex-wife, son, and daughter-in-law (Marina Hands, amazing in LADY CHATTERLEY but with little to do here really) manage to bring a bunch of his old friends - some of the other characters from the earlier film - to visit him. It's the relationship that he and Sbastien develop with Nathalie (Marie-Jose Croze), the daughter of one of Rmy's friends and a heroin addict who becomes their pipeline for the drug, that really invigorates the film and helps to lift it at least partially out of the tired father-and-son-reconciling-in-the-face-of-death genre. Nathalie seems smart enough and not quite wholly gone in her addiction, but she's close to it, and it's her need for warmth and support - and her willingness to help Rmy even as he tries to understand why she's allowed herself to fall so low - that really gives the film a moral center. Even this might be a bit clichd I suppose - the bourgeoise family bringing the lowly drug addict into the fold - but it's not so simple as that, and though we only get small glimpses into the lives of Rmy's peers, we can tell that most of them aren't far from the edge themselves, though their edges may be very different from drug addiction.

Which brings us back to Sbastien, who can buy off a great many of the problems that crop up in the film, but who ultimately has to really reckon with whether or not money is, in fact, the answer. It's the ties of family and friendship of course, and more explicitly the realization that everyone at the end of the film has that reconciliation and forgiveness have to be attempted at the end if any real happiness is to be had, that really matter, ultimately. And even if the film doesn't necessarily have anything new or exciting to say about these issues, it does in the end say what it does in a lovely and understanding way.

Not for me a great film then - I'm a little puzzled at the number of awards, and the very high ratings here and elsewhere; perhaps others saw some things I didn't - but a nice meditation, and rather relevant for someone who doubts the possibility of ever having a real relationship with his own father.

INVASIONS is a tightly written expose of the decline of not only the Quebecois and their policy choices over the last 50 years, but more largely an observant look at how people and their mores change and how they go through them. INVASIONS discusses euthanasia,education,social medicine,world history,religious belief,familial relationships,drug use,sex etc. and asks us not to judge it,but to observe it. That is very tough for some folks to do. This film offers NO answers,but rather raises questions. It is one of the singlemost profound pieces of film work that has elicited a lot of discussion afterwards.

2042298,5,B0001XAPWE,"I honestly did not know what to expect with ""The Barbarian Invasion"". Heck, it took me about a half hour to figure out it was a Canadian movie rather than the French movie I initially thought it was.  I had trouble, at first, knowing when to take a scene seriously or satirically but I was catching on and finding myself enjoying every step of the way.  There is a lot of political comment in this movie and the health care system in Canada and the labor unions come under the severest satire.  The squemish may object to the sexual innuendos whether they be blatant or merely suggestive but, I have to admit, there was a lot of red-faced humor in this movie.  Somewhere along the way, we glimpse some serious commentary about life, death, and relationships with one another.  The element that raises ""The Barbarian Invasion"" above crude sexual slapstick and up to the level of respectability is the relationship between father and son.  The way the film stays with that metamorphisis of anger and resentment  into love and forgiveness is the beauty of ""The Barbarian Invasion"".  The path that leads us there is riddled with so much gratuitous humor and political satire (as well as insight) that it's hard, sometimes, to stay on track.  The ending, as objectionable as it may be to many, also serves as a reminder to how love can compromise standards to achieve the needs of a loved one.  In that way, ""The Barbarian Invasion"" mirrors the strength of ""Million Dollar Baby"" in a most complementary manner.

What had me stumped the most about this movie was the meaning of the movie's title.  I accepted it to mean the effect on the son when he tried to come to the rescue of the father.  Although I understand the objections many may have, this is a skillfully made movie that tells a powerful message.",1177459200,2,1802,4.628930817610063
2042299,4,B0001XAPWE,"""Barbarian Invasions"" revolves around the final days of a decadent and third rate scholar dying from cancer.  Remy is in his mid-fifties and his self indulgent lifestyle has destroyed a marriage and alienated a son and daughter.  Remy's students apparently see through the man's shallowness and barely give him the time of day.  Fortunately, the son Sebastien never embraced the father's immature socialist economic theories.  He is now an affluent businessman able to spend money to help Remy experience a more pleasant death.

It leaves one speechless observing Sebastien's struggles with the Canadian public healthcare system.  It is downright awful---and thoroughly corrupt.  Patients are crammed together in small rooms.  Thievery is rampant and hospital administrators are afraid of the unionized workforce.  Bribes must be paid under the table to get anything done.  Remy and Sebastien are even compelled to travel to the United States for advanced medical testing.  Is Canada a Third World nation?  This sure seems to be the case.  Do you know anybody who is infatuated with taxpayer funding of health care?  If so, make sure they see ""Barbarian Invasions.""  This could turn them into hard core Republican voters before the end of story.  No, this is not a great film.  It is not for everybody.

This film, which won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, does just that. Remy Girard is dying, and now he must come to grips with how he has lived. In a number of significant ways he remains deeply alienated--he started cheating on his wife six months after they married; his chief accomplishment in life upon which he dwells and which forms a major theme of the film is his lifelong sexual escapades; he is estranged from his two children; he describes his work as a professor as total failure; he admits that he is scared of dying; and his son even has to pay some of his students to visit him in the hospital to assure him how sorely he will be missed. But his friends gather around him, they talk and celebrate, and he reconciles at some level with his two children. But is it believable that his son would really bypass bureaucrats and bribe union officials to get an entire unused floor of the hospital so Remy could have peace and quiet, that snorting heroin at his stage of the game is really such a great idea, and that his former wife would so graciously welcome his lovers at Remy's deathbed?

Others here have summarized the plot, but it is the many background stories that have caused this film to capture my admiration and I can easily place it on my all-time top ten list.

I will admit that I'm a sucker for entourage films, yet this is one of the best of its type due to the many inadvertent interactions between the cast.

If you learn nothing else from The Invasion of Barbarians, you will learn that Liberalism, Socialism, and Communism in every form destroy society, killing the innocent, transforming the naive into the corrupt.  Am I wrong?  Isn't this the lesson we learn from our dying Liberal Social Studies Professor, Remy?

Poor Remy, he's as liberal as his young piers at Berkley; yet they have won the Socialist beauty prize, The Pulitzer.  He's a Canadian, so no wonder those statues go to Americans.  Those ugly Americans down there take everything from the poor French speaking Quebecians.  Nevertheless, if you want a brain scan on demand, cross the St Lawrence because it ain't gonna happen in the new Canada of diversity.

Remy is a child of the 60's and as an academic propagandizing to empty-headed freshmen, he like his piers hate George Bush.  That is too easy to exploit for a Righty like myself.  I have always understood the Liberal Elite to be contemptuous of anyone that disagrees with the geniuses of Socialism.  And Remy's Liberal pals rain down Al Gore platitudes and disdain for America, those pesky, over-fed capitalists.

2042306,5,B0001XAPWE,"A somewhat lovable epicurean womanizer (Rmy Girard as Rmy) is dying of cancer in the hallway of a crowded Quebec hospital.  His accomplished millionaire son Sebastian (Stphane Rousseau) decides that as a fitting last gesture of love for his partially estranged father he will make dad's last days as happy and comfortable as possible.  To this end he gets him not just a private room, but a private floor in the basement of the hospital by bribing the right people.  He recruits a handful of Rmy's old friends and ex-lovers to come and visit him amid sumptuous servings of food and wine.  He pays some ex-students to come and remember their not exactly beloved teacher.  And finally he gets a strayed family member Nathalie (Marie-Josee Croze who won the Best Actress award at Cannes for her performance) to procure and administer heroin to Rmy for his pain.

Girard is excellent in the part (although he carries a bit too much weight for a guy about to die of cancer); but what makes this an outstanding film is the award-winning script and direction by  Denys Arcand.  This is a movie that is witty, honest, funny, sentimental (but not too sentimental), deeply human, candid about life, love, sex, and death, and filled with the kind of sharp, satirical dialogue that all screenwriters wish they had the ability to write.  However this movie will offend some people, which accounts for some of the nasty reviews.

First, there is the little matter of heroin.  Arcand makes the experience seem like something wonderful and absolutely necessary in a medical sense.  But a closer look reveals that this justified use is only for Rmy who is a terminal patient in excruciating pain.  Note that Nathalie is a junkie who is ruining her life and knows it.

Second, there is the candor about Rmy's sex life and the many risque jokes including some from an old gay couple that may offend some mainstream viewers.  And there is an elitist feel to the intellectual atmosphere of the gathered friends that will not set well in America's (or Canada's) Heartland.  And some will be offended by the implication from Sebastian's arrogant and successful behavior that money can buy almost anything and that corruption is the order of the day.  And finally there is the matter of euthanasia which some viewers find immoral.

However this is not  primarily a political movie.  The dialogue that refers to the evolution of some of the characters from socialists to deconstructionists, is kind of like somebody from say Texas recalling that ""I used to be long-haired hippy but now I'm clean-shaven evangelical.""  It's appropriately atmospheric talk from Rmy's academic world.  The real story here is about how to live and how to die.  Arcand's prescription is to live life to the fullest and to die peacefully in your sleep.  This is the civilized way, and that is part of the reason that the film is ironically called ""The Barbarian Invasions"" (from a line in the film).  When it comes to civilization the barbarians are always at the gate.

Of course if we want to get symbolic, the barbarian invasions could include the cancer itself, especially when we consider that Rmy is a history professor who has spent a lifetime reading, writing and lecturing about barbarian invasions.  (By the way, whether the 9/11 attacks on the US are barbarian invasions is again beside the point of the movie.)

Bottom line: this film won a slew of international awards including the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2004.  It is one of the best films I've seen in a while.  I would rate it in my top one hundred of all time.",1139875200,7,3596,4.781199351701783

The scene where he turns over his classroom evoking nothing but presumably well-earned and richly deserved apathy from his students was the only truly genuine moment in the film, as he walks down the hall so easily replaced and immediately forgotten.

The dialogue zaps and zings along but this film still manages to hold the characters at arm's length away from us.  I found it hard to really identify or empathize with them, they always remained just a bunch of actors on screen reciting a marvelously well-written script.

That said, this film is to be saluted for its many unexpected turns, its willingness to avoid easy pat answers or resolutions, its streetwise and earthy moments.  Would be especially educational for Americans who want to learn more about our northern neighbors, and to see the world from a very different---and refreshing---perspective.",1116720000,11,1055,5.188235294117647
2042309,4,B0001XAPWE,"The Barbarian Invasions is a rare and unconventional film: it is complicated, but the complications come not from the plot, but from the characters. At the end of the film, we are not left wondering what happened, because all of the events in the film are pretty clear, but rather why what happened did, and what the motivations were. This all sounds fairly abstract, I'm sure, but when you see the film, you'll understand what I mean.

Remy is a now-former college professor lying on his death bed in a hospital, suffering from a terminal disease. His son Sebastien, a young man with more money than he knows what to do with, comes to Montreal from London to be with his father in his dying days, but there is bad blood between them. Sebastien resents his father for never being there for him and his sister when they were children. You see, it was a well-known fact that Remy was unfaithful and had many mistresses for a long time. His wife knows this and has forgiven him for it, but Sebastien has no way of recovering his lost childhood spent mostly without a father, and so he bears a grudge; however, here he is, constantly at his father's bedside.

Not only is Sebastien there, but he is doing everything in his power to make his father comfortable: he manages to get his father a private room on an empty floor in the hospital, and gathers together all of Remy's old friends to come and visit him. And when his father's pain is unbearable, Sebastien, on the advice of a doctor friend of his, recruits an old friend and now a junkie, Nathalie, to buy heroin and take it with Remy to ease his pain. Along the way, we learn more and more about Remy and his life, through stories told by his friends, his wife, and himself. The main thing he worries about on his deathbed is whether his life had any meaning.

All of the characters are so complex. For instance, Remy's wife has known about his mistresses the entire time, and yet she is still unabashedly devoted to him. She obviously thinks he is a wonderful man, yet he regrets a lot of things he did and a lot of things he didn't do. He doesn't see himself the same way as everyone else seems to. His relationship with Sebastian is similar: Sebastien resents him to no end, yet finds himself drawn to his father and unwilling to let him go. And Nathalie may be the most complex individual: she is an admitted junkie, she knows she will let Sebastien down and doesn't seem to care. During her interactions with Remy while getting him high, she seems to change. Maybe she never realized what the drugs were actually doing to her because she never had company.

This is a very good film; it many of the elements that make movies interesting: humor, suffering, intellect, existentialism, and ultimately heartbreak. It's a thinkpiece, and when it was over, it had me thinking, but I wasn't quite sure about what. If you want to be seriously challenged by a film, and laugh a little bit along the way, then The Barbarian Invasions is for you.",1110758400,7,2993,4.4963235294117645

The hero is a talkative former professor who continues to enjoy pontificating as he grows more ill.  Some Amazon critics complained this film is full of pseudo-intellectuals.  But that is partly who the hero is, the particular kind of human being he happened to be.  I generally detest pseudo-intellectuals in films and especially in person.  The first 5 minutes of this film had me worried but soon I found it surprisingly did not take away from the film.  I highly recommend this film for the characters and for the universal human experiences it showed.  The little mini-education on the reality of nationalized healthcare is another reason in itself for Americans to watch this movie.  As much as I, as an American, loath our current health insurance system, this film showed me jumping to nationalized healthcare is definitely the proverbial frying pan after the fire. The fact that I lived in another ""rich"" industrialized country that has nationalized healthcare gave me firsthand knowledge of how bad it can be.  Pretty damn bad.  Our hero had a millionaire son who loved him; most people don't.  For those Americans who are considering watching this film but don't want to hear a bunch of anti-American crap, you're in luck.  This film had US scenes but they were realistic.  No love of the US was shown but that also is reality since this is a French-Canadian film.  I think Americans don't mind when films take shots at us but they better be fair ones.  I wouldn't even call these shots.  They showed reality.

It is interesting to see a health care system in Canada that is just as corrupt and incompetent as its American counterpart.  The relationships in this story certainly are a joy to witness and it is a pleasure to watch a movie that does not celebrate anti-intellectualism.  There are no characters here who cling to stupidity as if it were a badge of courage.  Still I must be sad for the dying man's atheism.  Atheism isn't about bravely facing life without the unproveable God.  Atheism is egotism : the refusal to be able to follow and the refusal to allow that man is not the most intelligent life form in the universe.

2042312,5,B0001XAPWE,"Along with ""Pieces of April,"" ""Invasions"" is the best film I've seen in the last two years.  It is richly deserving of its 2003 Academy Award for best foreign language film.  The acting ensemble here was first featured in writer/director Denys Arcand's first film, ""The Decline of American Civilization"" (1986).  Now, Arcand has reassembled the troupe, with the idea of celebrating the final days of lead character Rmy (Rmy Girard), suffering from inoperable stomach cancer.  He's not going down without a fight.

Watching the ""Making of..."" feature on the DVD, there's no doubt that the cast represents the elite of Quebec's acting intelligentsia.  The level of discourse that takes place amongst the cast is impressive.  They've seen layers of the film that are two, three levels deeper than I would have thought.

Sitting silent through most of this discussion is Stphane Rousseau (who plays Rmy's son Sbastien).  He's a stand-up comic by training, not a professional actor.  You'd never know it.  The differences between idealist socialist Dad and realist capitalist son drive a lot of the film.  Rousseau is the breakout star here, along with Marie-Jose Croze (as junkie Nathalie), whose eyes could melt a snow bank.

Arcand gets in some good shots along the way on Canada's socialized medicine, Catholicism (comes in for a series of blows from different directions), the U.S., unions, the failure of Quebec's political idealism....and probably a bunch of other targets that I'm not astute enough to pick up on.

2042315,5,B0001XAPWE,"The Barbarian Invasions is nothing if not a chatty movie, almost every character is well developed and most of what is said is amusing without the self-satisfied piety or strenuous jokiness of garden variety Hollywood flicks.

A man on his death bed, Remy, invites all his friends and family hoping in such a reunion to pass on his pearls of wisdom, and to reconcile all that has remained undone or that shouldn't have been done.

Woven around this seemingly simple frame are many relationships, all explored richly and with fluid rhythm, and some fabulous dialogue veering around insightful ideologies.

For instance, Remy and his son wage what seems to be a lifelong argument, the young man defending his free-market values, faith in technological progress and ascetic lifestyle, and Remy extolling the virtues of socialism and epicurean excess. I was surprised to see some footage of 9/11 in support for the negatives that accompany American-style capitalism.

The title of the film may derive from the bloody history of mankind and all the 'isms' that we've dabbled in (marxism, leninism, etc) -- all of which are talked about in a pseudo-intellectual but riveting manner among these friends -- but there is an unmistakable undercurrent of the ultimate barbaric invasion: time, which wastes us without answering the questions of our intellect and spirit. Remy concedes in anguish at one point, ""I haven't found a meaning. I have to keep searching"".

The mood is not always this despondent though, it shifts effortlessly between defiant exuberance and wistful contemplation without ever being mawkish. To an Asian like myself, the concept of having many women, all in presence of each other and not minding it, may be a bit too French, but perhaps the way we get introduced to our protagonist's many infatuations is so warm that it'd be difficult to think of it as anything other than totally sweet.

For all its urbanity and cultural contradictions of global capitalism, this marvelously humane film ultimately tugs at the core of what matters most to us and peppers it with some broad and devilishly funny chitchat. Couldn't recommend it highly enough, buy it! You'll be seeing it more than once.",1097971200,24,2201,5.049586776859504
2042316,5,B0001XAPWE,"It was rather surprising to learn that this anti-socialist movie won a Foreign Film Oscar. Denys Arcand is well-know for his biting satire of Qubcois society, against the clergy in Jsus of Montral and against Qubcois politics in this movie. Invasions Barbares is a sequel to the famous Le Dclin de l'Empire Amrican (The Decline of the American Empire), where he philosophizes on the end of the American hegemony based on history and some fast-and-dirty sociology.

In this movie, the Fall of the American Empire is represented by the WTC attack, but the bulk of the movie is not concerned with the United States but with Quebec. In this, Rmy (Rmy Girard), the history professor with a high libido, is dying of cancer and his previous relationships give him no solace. Everyone from Dclin comes back to support him in his hard times, including his estrangled son Sbastien (Stphane Rousseau, a humourist who plays this serious role with great talent). He's become a resourceful and prosperous man of finance, and uses his money to bribe hospital officials to give his father his own floor, and dips his toe in the underworld to get heroin to alleviate his father's pain.

Rmy admits that his life has been rather pointless, and that the social utopia proposed by Qubecois intellectuals has failed. This point is reinforced by the dingy and corrupt (but unfortunately realistic) portrayal of the health care system in Qubec, and the failure of the War on Drugs. The movie is far from being all drama : a commentator noted that it was not as much about death as it was about life. He also calls his son Sbastien one of the barbarians invading utopia, a saviour of the state in which he (and Qubec) has placed himself.

There is still a lot of talking in this movie, like in Dclin. Everyone is there to put their two cents in. But at least this time the discussion is not the only proeminent part of the movie, which makes it more of an interesting piece rather than a long tedium.",1097798400,44,1976,4.672413793103448
2042317,1,B0001XAPWE,"Almost everyone reviewing this film for Amazon has given it five stars; herewith a dissenting opinion. My objections are three. First, the subplot involving heroin. When the all-but-estranged can-do son arrives to take care of terminally ill dad, he procures with no qualms or questions whatsoever--and on the recommendations of a doctor no less--a full and steady supply of heroin to ease daddy's pain. This is taken as salutory and normal by all concerned, and no odder than if dad were taking ibuprofen. Second, the film, this ""celebration of life,"" follows the drug use to its logical conclusion, as the sick professor is killed, through the technique of assisted suicide, via a heroin overdose. Absolutely no one objects, which may say more about their feelings for the man than the film intended. (Don't they have palliative care in Canada?) Third, the people in this film are truly an odious lot. To me this film was an updated version of ""The Big Chill"" with the suicide at the end rather than the beginning. A bunch of self-obsessed refugees from the sixties whose main preoccupations are sex and drugs (no rock and roll in this one, unlike The Big C.). People deathly afraid of growing up, even as death confronts them. For a classic view of a man facing his own mortality, try Tolstoy's story ""The Death of Ivan Ilich,"" not this embarrassment.",1096243200,23,1354,4.865800865800866
2042318,5,B0001XAPWE,"Mirroring a climactic era of moral reversal, Denys Arcand has distilled the alternative to living a good and honorable life into a hazy Czaristic fantasy - surrounded by supplicants, oblivious to truth and pending a tragic demise. Unfortunately, there are enough stumbling blocks to understanding this movie's message that morally-challenged, cultural elitists can effortlessly misinterpret it so as to validate their own inclinations. To them, the film's hero, Remy, bumbling through life by exploring mediocrity, is a lovable cad, who gets rewarded at life's end with all the detestable things to which he has grown accustomed. The mistaken message being celebrated is that one can engage in all manner of moral turpitude, but in the end everything will fall into place - no harm done. Given his abuse of a power relationship with an intern, our former American president has done much to sensitize society's intolerance to such creatures. These days, cads are more likely to end their lives alone, betrayed, and afraid. So what's the real message?

Despite its snob-appeal, Les Invasions Barbares supports traditional values by mocking what can fairly be termed ""compassionate liberalism"". It's not a straightforward tragedy, comedy or farce, although there are elements of all these simple plot devices. The needed nuance for exploring this film's true meaning is recognizing that it's a compound tragedy. It maintains the elements of the classic Greek model in that the hero must die for his transgressions. Yet, the plot is infused from the beginning with the redemptive possibilities characteristic of the Yov (Job) model. Redemption starts with identifying one's failings, and that recognition is the penultimate element in Greek tragedy. But, Remy's recognition occurs in the beginning of the film, at the hospital and in the presence of his longsuffering wife. He acknowledges failures in his commitments to his wife, his family, and his chosen profession. Here the audience is left on a knife edge; it's too early to end the film by having Remy die, so we are left with the delightful possibility that Remy can use this newfound consciousness towards a redeemed future.

Any hope for redemption takes a swift detour with the arrival of the son, Sebastian, and the aftermath of Remy's self-indulgent and self-justifying outburst against him. Remy refuses to hear the very facts that support his own recent reflections. Sebastian is incapable of dealing with his conflicted and still immature father. Bowing to his mother's need to maintain family dignity, he copes by yielding to his father's false pride. Throughout the rest of the film, Remy is tortured by indecision and a consciousness of truth that bobs intermittently to the surface, only to be sucked down by internal turbulence. Too often Remy slips back, addicted to his past and to the narcotic of soothing lies that he has told himself over the years. Self-deception is the rule during a trip to the American clinic. The trip back to the hospital brings news of the judgment - disease prognosis, terminal.

From here on, Sebastian is the major protagonist, and his actions only serve to thwart any possibility for Remy's psychological rehabilitation. Not extending to his father the ability or desire to make any change, Sebastian lavishes Remy's remaining time with a mind-numbing array of deceptive gimmicks designed to assuage his father's twisted heart. These include cynically paying off Remy's students and the implied coaching of Remy's daughter, who by sailing the high seas has symbolically removed herself as far from her father's world as possible. Sebastian insincerely flings his sister's heart-wrenching productions onto Remy's eager lap. By her final correspondence, she is so overcome with regret that her actions can't match her forced spin; she can no longer face the camera (if only he could have been an honorable man). Reinforcing Remy's failure to find redemption are the ever-present societal symbols of unrepentant corruption and the systemic denials that permit their perpetuation. Chief among these are a self-serving healthcare bureaucracy and a Quebecois infrastructure rife with trade union and mob-connection lubricity. Sebastian too easily negotiates what are frustrating impediments to rational people, expertly manipulating the surrounding sleaze to his own design.

Sebastian also dredges up a rogue's gallery from Remy's past, some weary yet unrepentant loose ladies, as well as a pair of eccentric male homosexuals. As expected, leftists superficially view these extra characters in a sympathetic light, because on the surface their presence appears to help Remy. However, a mainstream audience can quickly recognize that their dialogue, rather than being uplifting, is coarse and grating. By the evening scene at the cottage, Remy's friends from the past appear to be the Devil's own harpies, whose only purposes are to reassure Remy about his past and to blind him to any self-realization. Premonitions of Remy's violent demise are intermittent news footage and analyses of the 9/11 tragedy. Similar to Remy's disease, these barbarians are striking inside the corpus. It's always understood that barbarians can only succeed after advanced moral decay. To that end, Remy's coterie of flatterers further tarnishes itself by adding to the background Bush-bashing served up by likeminded television network flunkies. Without giving away the ending, there is no moral ambiguity surrounding Remy's necessary death; the matter has been enforced by the right-minded people of Michigan, thanks ironically to CBS News and 60 Minutes (Jack Kevorkian). It is yet another stumbling block employed with immense import.

Sons regularly envision fathers in light of painfully missed opportunities, often vowing never to make the same mistakes. Anticlimactically, Sebastian narrowly rejects repeating his father's cycle of banality. On a personal note: My own dying father asked me, `why had god given him cancer, since he had always loved god'. I could have gotten angry and asked him why he thought that half of our family sacrificed its dignity by refusing to be with him. Alternatively, I could have insincerely parroted his self-pity; thus, giving him no chance or reason to reform. On this point, I chose to say nothing.",1095206400,27,6318,5.352112676056338

It did not think I would like a movie like this wow was I wrong. Now I must own this movie and recommend it to everyone who I care about. This movie can change your outlook on life without making the fatal mistake that most movies make it does not try too hard. Too bad American filmmakers can not make a movie like this.

Remy, a boomer college professor who lived life on his own terms with little thought to how it affected others, is dying.  Deny Arcand has written and directed a story that sums up the meaning of his life and indirectly the strange legacy that his son's money is able to arrange by bringing people to his father's bedside. Without spoiling endings, Remy's almost one-dimensional, medieval view of death is ushered into a renaissance. Barbarians, if they are terrorists battling for attention or cancer shutting down the body or if they are immigrants or handsome male lovers bringing Italian truffles disrupt everything, we are no longer our own little universe. Life is transformed into something bigger with national health care, porches full of friends, lakes, drug addicts, migrating birds, nuns who value touch and the mystery, so many other people and tall trees that know the way up.  Of course, this is a production the draws you in with its wonderful acting, camerawork and direction.  It poses the problem that clinging to the past is like an early death against a backdrop of older offspring chanting they will be different. .

2042321,5,B0001XAPWE,"Rmy (Rmy Girard) the main character of this movie is near death but he is afraid or may be not so afraid. he is more afraid about his failure in life than up impending death. His friends, ex-mistresses, ex-wife, son and so many more come around him to help him through the journey - the final step. though the movie is about death and the last journey but still it is not morbid. it shows death as an inevitable feature of life. Remi's friends are not great success (in our so called scale of success measured by money) but they help him through in his last days with their eternal high spirits.

One particular scene just made me laugh to death Sbastian's(Rmy's son) art-dealer girlfriend receives a call to the vaults of a Montreal cathedral to appraise a huge accumulation of religious art donated by parishioners. The priest showing her around this huge pile of junk remarks that people used to come to church, but stopped rather suddenly, in 1966. What, one wonders happened in 1966?

After a long time we see a movie with absolutely superlative screenplay and dialogues. Stephane Rousseau - acting Remi's son Sbastian is wonderful. The only area I have a little complain in the cinematography and choice of colours in the canvas - it could have been little better.

This is a great movie which changes the idea about the final step - the final step need not be harsh and can be civilized and descent.",1091836800,5,1406,4.5936254980079685
2042322,4,B0001XAPWE,"Rmy (Rmy Girard) is a man now in his 50s, who has lived a passionate life. Never prudent, he has left a devoted ex-wife, a long string of mistresses, and old friends from his radical days mostly behind him. Now he is fatally ill and confined to bed in a hospital in Montreal. His estranged son, Sbastien (Stphane Rousseau), a man of the opposite temperament, comes from London to visit his father before he dies. In spite of the tension between them -Rmy is a ""sensual socialist"" and Sbastien an ""ambitious and puritanical capitalist""- Sbastien uses his business acumen and forceful nature to elicit some action from Canada's socialist system of medicine and to arrange visits from his father's old friends. As Rmy, his friends, his ex-wife (Dorothe Berryman), and Sbastien interact and reminisce, the amusing and interesting circumstances that life has brought them to are uncovered.

""The Barbarian Invasions"" real strength is its sharp dialogue. This could be just the sentimental reflections of an old man on his radical and promiscuous younger days. That would be tedious. And, truthfully, there are a few scenes that get too sentimental and a few instances in which characters are too neurotic for my taste. But most of the dialogue is sharp and frank and the characters so vivacious that the film's directness and humor overcome the clichs. ""The Barbarian Invasions"" other strength is its cast, in particular Stphane Rousseau, whose intense portrayal of the introverted, determined Sbastien, frequently exasperated with his father, is always interesting. The excellent supporting performances are numerous, including Rmy's two former mistresses and his nurse. You might roll your eyes a few times, but clichs and mawkishness become that way because they are, after all, common occurrences, not because they're unrealistic. On the other hand, ""The Barbarian Invasions"" displays the typical French carelessness with reality. Cell phone use is never permitted in hospitals, and Rmy's experiences with painkillers are implausible. But the keen dialogue and these characters that are so full of life make this one worth seeing.

The DVD: There is a 55-minute film in which the cast of ""The Barbarian Invasions"" discuss the film's themes over lunch at a county house. A group of actors are essentially touting the film's profundity by discussing and disputing its meaning in their own lives, often with great emotion and candidness. I doubt that this sort of exchange will appeal to an American audience. But if you want to see what it is, I suggest starting somewhere in the middle, as the conversation is slow to get off the ground. English subtitles and closed captioning are available for the film. Subtitles are available for the bonus feature.",1091750400,5,2750,5.149888143176733
2042323,3,B0001XAPWE,"What I enjoy most is that the people that praise this movie most highly are the people that this movie is propaganda against.  Apart from the right wing son, these characters are right wing fantasies about what liberal people must be like.  For all that, they screw up the right wing son as well when the get into the technicalities of his profession (describing the mechanics of an interest rate swap when the son presumably trades commodity futures or some such derivative).  Note that each of the professors has tragic family problems while the trader finds the real meaning of love: responsibility.  The reason people run from American movies is the lack of subtlety.  Out of the frying pan . . .

The commentary concerning universal health care and labor unions is funny and for all I know, true, but I can't trust the information due to the clear bias.  Not that there's anything wrong with exploring the complexities of the libertarian philosophy in a work of fiction (many successful examples), but the real flaw with this movie is that there is no real complexity within it.",1091491200,4,1083,4.759358288770054

Remy's wife, Louise (Dorothee Berryman), separated from him decades ago after he was caught in the act with another woman, has stayed in touch with Remy since the separation. Louise calls their son, Sebastien (Stephane Rousseau), who dislikes the fathers ways and has embraced capitalistic ideals. Despite Sebastien's bitterness to his father he travels with a private jet from London, England to Canada, where he is to meet the father and begin helping bring his friends back to see him before he departs. Sebastien, a very successful business man, uses his skills in trade to move ruthlessly forward to get what he wants for his father by buying his way with the almighty dollar. However, it is not within the money that they find each other but through kind words, closeness, and genuinely expressed feelings.

 Denys Arcand directed a genuinely warm film dealing with a family that confronts the looming death of a family member and how it affects them and the close friends who participate in a forgiving manner. Barbarian Invasions is brilliantly written as it involves the audience in an intellectual discussion of several topics such as capitalism, socialism, racism, family, love, and much more. Arcand dissects these topics and how they disrupt the daily rhythm of people's lives where the they are forced into a situation",1091404800,2,1500,5.09349593495935

But when his son, Sebastien, arrives from London Remy's prospects dramatically change after Sebastien financially arranges for old friends, former students, and lovers to attend his bedside in addition to providing a private room and many comforts not available to the other patients. What ensues is a moving portrait of a touching farewell for a dying individual; one can only hope to be surrounded by friends and loved ones at their own time of passing.

Surprisingly this film fails to be bogged down with sentimentality, as one would expect from this subject matter. Instead, the tone throughout remains strangely upbeat and humorous. In-depth and philosophical conversations often take place between Remy and his old friends as they discuss sex, history, religion, culture, academia, and yet more sex. The plot may be predictable, but there was something enduring and quiet about it that kept me interested and entertained throughout. Of course there are profound political statements regarding the decaying state of medicine in Quebec along with other subjects of interest, but I didn't feel that personal agendas stole the essence of the show.

All in all, THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS is a very meaningful film, just be warned that you may need to keep tissues at your side at all times.",1090454400,8,1512,5.2181069958847734

The professor's wealthy estranged son pays out of pocket for private care for his father feeling it is his duty to do so. He also attempts to score heroin to ease his father's pain.

 A very touching, funny drama ""The Barbarian Invasions"" is presented in French with English subtitles (although some of the spoke langauge is English during certain sequences as well). Director Deys Arcand touches on our fear of mortality and leaving things unsaid or unresolved with our own loved ones. Although this is a bout a man who is dying, he's full of life throughout the film indicating that Arcand's view on dying is that it's just part of the process of living.

 The film doesn't have much in the way of special features but does have an unusual hour long documentary on the making of the film. Originally shot for Canadian television, it's an unusual and thought provoking approach to a documentary. The unique approach he takes makes this more than a ""clips"" documentary. At one point the cast share dinner and their thoughts on their characters and the story.

2042330,5,B0001XAPWE,"Oh my. Get me out of here!

To begin with: It is a warm, funny, loving movie about a guy dying, surrounded, thanks to his (estranged--she kicked him out 15 years earlier, when she found out he had slept with nearly all the women in Montreal) wife, his (successful, rich, employed by a London bank as a risk-management expert--also estranged) son--by all his friends, his loved ones, and as much comfort as money and heroin can provide. But it is not just about him, and dying--as we all die, wondering, wishing we had done....things (my God! he was a teacher--and a good one too), but about the lives of the people who surround him, whom he brings together, who have, and develop, their own meaningful relationships.

Secondly, you love everyone in it--except for Pierre's bitchy wife--why didn't he stick with the girl he met in the message parlour in ""Decline of the American Empire""? But Pierre seems to love her, so perhaps, had she been part of the circle, we would have found things to love about her as well.

Third--oh, let's quit this numerical stuff--I wanted nothing so much as to go to Montreal after I had seen this movie. And I live in Berkeley! It is SO beautiful there. As for Universal Health Care, it may be far from perfect--but do you know where all those people lying in the hospital corridor would be lying here? ON THE STREET.

Next, the conversation, the yapping, as someone said, is exquisitely funny, or/and intelligent, thought provoking, informative (the ""pompier"" puns; the discussion at the last big supper about intelligence being national and intermittent, rather than being the property of individual geniuses---those attending, rivaling, and supporting Sophocles at the opening of one of his plays; ditto Michelangelo in the Italian Renaissance; the men who wrote the American Declaration of Independence);
Nathalie and Sebastien sitting by the fire, comforting each other---S's cell phone rings; he takes it out. Nathalie throws it in the fire. It says something--out of the flames-- about ""having a problem here."" They both start laughing. ""Think you're funny?"" says S. [There is litle spoken English in this movie--though the slang surrounding the purchase and use of heroin has many English words: dealer, junkie, overdose, etc.])

Remy (and thus I assume Arcand) has, for two movies now, had a pet theory: that the 20th century was not particularly bloody. After estimating, for the nun--oh she is wonderful!--how many people have been slaughtered in the last 100 years (by Mao, in the Gulags, in both world wars, etc.), says that a few centuries ago, the Spaniards, without a holocaust, without bombs, without artillery-- managed to slaughter 150,000,000 Indians--with an axe, and that subsequent powers had found this so inspiring, that they had slaughtered 50,000,000 more.

American films were great at some point in the past, but there have been very few good american films in recent years.  The Barbarian Invasions is a moving tale of the bonds of family and friends.  It reveals a harsh reality which none of dare face in our daily lives, a reality we fear when we wake late at night, a reality which silently haunts us, a reality which we will all face one day.

2042332,5,B0001XAPWE,"Les Invasions Barbares (barbarian Invasions) is an excellent film, directed by a master artist.  The
film is about so much more than a relationship with a son, it speaks to the universal struggle of
man facing his own mortality while taking stock of what his ideals and whether he has achieved
anything worth note in his life.  The final words from Remy's adult daughter (I won't spoil it) will
break any parent's heart.
It does not surprise me that some reviewers, who are less familiar with French Canada, missed the
important part of the point.  French culture within Canada is a huge contributor to our civil
society in general and to our art community specifically.  Remy and his friends were not just
mourning his coming death but rather all of the reality that has dampened their dreams from the
cultural, sexual and quiet revolutions of the 60's and 70's.
This film is a celebration of family, friends and in the end dying well.
Just a note for a couple of the right wing reviewers who were salivating over the negative
portrayal of Canadian medicare. I have never been in a Quebec hospital but I certainly have been
in ones in Ontario, and even the humblest was far superior to the one depicted in the film.  Most
hospitals in Canada are state of the art facilities.  I suspect that the director used a bit of artistic
exaggeration to make his point. It's true that Canadian hospitals are busy, because they serve
100% of the population, there isn't a 20% un-insured under-class here.
This DVD package comes with a 98 minute theatrical version as well as a second disk that is 112
minutes long.  The bonus feature (located on the 98 minute disk) is worth the purchase price of
the DVD all on its own.  Instead of the usual boring interview with the director and the light
technician, Barbarian Invasions brings the whole cast together at the cottage setting, from the
film, for a full meal with lots of wine and discussion.  During the discussion you will come to
realize that like so many French Canadian actors, these folks are real thinkers.  They debate
politics, society, film etc.
Barbarian Invasions proves that Canadian directors can produce film of a European calibre.  I
would highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates good, intelligent film!",1089936000,18,2272,4.770408163265306
2042333,5,B0001XAPWE,"THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS is a miracle movie. As conceived and directed by Denys Arcand this film is a brilliantly entertaining story, full of hilarious dialogue and situations, full of intellectual stimulation, brilliant metaphors and similes, full of probing philosophy, while standing as the finest examination of our society as it stands at the moment. The beauty of the film is that for all of the intellectual wealth it contains, it never bogs down with cerebral weightiness. The mood is consistently entertaining: the infinite messages contained are left as after burn.
Remy (and indelible characterization by Remy Girard) has lived a life of sexual freedom, intellectual pursuits (he is a Professor of History and defender of free thinking), and seems to have placed his family and wife in the periphery. Suddenly faced with a diagnosis of a rampantly aggressive and untreatable cancer, he rages against the world that no longer holds his tenets of civilization dear: he faces death having no legacy to leave the world he entered. His ex-wife notifies his worldly and wealthy Baby-Boomer generation son in his important office in London to return home, despite the fact that the son sees little point in rushing back  to the father who was never a father to him. The son Sebastien (in a sophisticated, engrossing performance by Stephane Rousseau) flies to Montreal and, in his manner of control, takes over, planning the care of this 'shameful father' in a manner that allows him to provide the best amenities while putting more emotional distance from his father. Money talks, and after Sebastien drives him to the USA for the best of scans and opinions only to hear that Remy will not follow-up by entering a US Medical Center, Remy is moved to a deserted floor of the hospital (grandly redecorated and staffed by Sebastien's conniving way with money bribes). Sebastien gathers the wildest assortment of Remy's friends, mistresses, and political/intellectual oddballs and gives Remy everything he could ask for - even satellite conversation with Remy's yachting-on-the-seas daughter. When the disease advances and the accompanying pain encroaches, Sebastien even arranges for heroin by coercing the addicted daughter of one of Remy's mistresses to supply the need. Eventually as the situation changes, Sebastien arranges for the entire entourage to move to a beautiful house by a lake outside Montreal and there the group eats, drinks, philosophizes, and entertains their old friend. At this point Sebastien and Remy are alone with their personal histories and disappointments and regrets and it is the playing out of how this is resolved that is the utter magic of this magnificent film. Though the ending of the film is implied from the outset, to spoil the final moments by revealing the actual moments of the story would be a disservice to the viewer
An added attraction on the DVD (in French and English with subtitles) is a filmed dinner with the entire cast (and to a person, this is a cast of gifted, virtuosic actors), discussing the movies, their characters, and more importantly looking at the Montreal that was the dream of the future when all of these actors were young and idealistic and now faces a stagnation and void that each sees as a threat to the future. These are articulate actors and their words and thoughts are intensely sensitive and informative. This added feature adds yet more depth in accompaniment to the film. THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS is a film to purchase for your private collection, a film to return to often as a reminder that living our lives as individual sanctities is the only way we will be able to maintain 'civilization' in this era of instant gratification and disregard for the past. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ON EVERY LEVEL!",1089936000,3,3771,5.062700964630225
2042334,3,B0001XAPWE,"Miramax's DVD cover does not mention the film's real subject matter, making it appear to be a romantic comedy when it actually depicts a man dying before his time of cancer. However grim that is in real life, Arcand doesn't succeed in portraying it with any real depth or emotional resonance. On one hand, this film is the usual middle-brow arthouse weepie about parents and children reconciling and celebrating life blah blah blah. On the other hand, it's the work of a bitter, somewhat reactionary old man who, like his characters, feels superannuated by a younger generation (the barbarians of the title?) who don't share his generation's values. This aspect of the film is much more interesting and enjoyable, especially the swipes at Canada's health care system, which all good liberal Americans are expected to envy. It is depicted as corrupt and falling apart, forcing the dying man and his son to drive to Vermont for a PET scan. The ending is undeniably emotionally moving, but any movie about terminal illness and death can't help but be. On the whole, this is a shallow but very watchable movie.",1089849600,7,1106,4.888297872340425
2042335,4,B0001XAPWE,"This is a film that realistically examines what is valuable in life. In my opinion this is a conservative, pro-capitalist film crafted by a disillusioned socialist/leftist - like me. The scenes in the hospital will resonate with all Canadians whose loved ones have been seriously ill, not just those in Quebec. The son's reaction to his father's plight are completely commendable and seem to me represented that way, without qualification. This is not a polemic however, no one is perfect, no one sits in judgement, save perhaps the viewer.",1089763200,2,540,5.078651685393258
2042336,4,B0001XAPWE,"I practically laughed my ass off at Denys Arcand's Barbarian Invasions, but you wouldn't imagine such a thing would happen...considering the plot. It concerns an old college professor who learns he's rapidly dying of cancer, and the bulk of the movie comprises his evasive and emotion-phobic son assembling friends and family to guide him through his last days. Of course, the successful and filthy-rich son is doing it more for himself than his father - the plethora of old friends provides him an easy way to avoid even being near his dying dad. And thus the refreshingly non-sentimental and wickedly funny Invasions goes on. The father is a marvel in the film - an old womanizer who happily expounds upon his sexual conquests (with his ex-wife and former lovers chiming in) and doing heroin to stave off the pain. His bedside companions come from all walks of life, and each provide a wonderful little contrast to the other characters. What you'll notice about the film, though, is that not once does it pander to tear-jerking effects, nor does it attempt to offer a squeaky-clean resolution. The quirkyness of the film tends to help it and hurt it - a subplot involving an estranged daughter of one of the old man's friends works better when geared toward the old man, not the son. Then again, the whole issue with the son never really comes to fruition, and I found the movie's last-minute resolution of that plot element schmaltzy at best. But I'm nitpicking - Invasions impressed me the most because it took me off guard with its raunchy humor and vibrant characters, and I enjoyed Arcand's insistence that all dying-of-cancer movies need not be 2 hour weep-fests. The Barbarian Invasions may not be a truly great film, but it's by all means a very good one. Considering most movies of this subject are manipulative pieces of crap, I'll take Invasions'  compelling absence of tear-jerking any day. GRADE: B",1084665600,9,1913,4.850152905198777
2042337,5,B0001XAPWE,"It is a great shame that in English speaking countries, foreign language films languish in art house theatres and rarely garner a wider audience.  ""The Barbarian Invasions"", based in Quebec and using French for most dialogue, falls into this category despite winning an Oscar for best foreign language film.
""The Barbarian Invasions"" covers the lingering death of Remy and the efforts of his often estranged son to repair past damage and encourage a final meeting with his friends.  In the process, the father and son become reconciled and learn humility from each other.  There is the evident truth that blood is thicker than water.
Remy's friends are an eclectic group although they can all be described as intellectuals except his son who, despite receiving a good education, reads no books and prefers video games for enjoyment.  This fact notwithstanding, the son is a successful investment banker based in London who is prepared to spend the time and money to ensure that his father's finals days are rich and comfortable.
To all readers of this review, please do not be discouraged by the fact that the film is sub-titled.  To dismiss a film for this reason is to deny access to a raft of great films.  ""The Barbarian Invasions"" is one such film.",1083456000,14,1253,4.886792452830188

The amazing script is simply extraordinary. All the cast is superb, specially Marie Josee Croze, winner in Cannes 2003 like best actress.
Watch this film and consider it from now a new classic canadian cinema.

His ex-wife calls upon his estranged son to return to Canada to help ease his father's last weeks. And what a job he does! It is raunchy and funny. Canadian heath care is often the brunt.

8017781,4,B0001XAPWE,"Remy has not led a perfect life.  He is failure as a scholar, a husband and a father.  Yet, as he lies dying, his estranged son returns and brings his family, friends, and mistresses together for his last days.  Surprisingly, the resentments have faded and his multiple mistresses chat freely with him about sex, love, and other things.  What made him special is his appreciation of them and of life.  He did not accomplish much, but he loved every minute of it.  His son arranges for him to have a private room, tests in America, and even heroin to kill the pain--a sad comment on the Canadian health care system.  Nonetheless, he decides [spoiler alert!] to commit  suicide by overdose in the presence of his friends.  This was clearly a political statement--but it did not ring true to the character's love of life.  Ironically, Remy and his friends' love of life leaves their children feeling neglected. The ways they compensate for this loss are more or less devastating to them, as movingly depicted here.  This film is very well done, and it lingers in the memory.",1500422400,,1071,4.704301075268817
8017782,4,B0001XAPWE,"This an obscure Canadian movie (In French with subtitles) that fascinated me when I first saw it about 15 year ago and once again when I viewed it last week.  It is a new twist on the conflict between father and son, between the old and new generations.  Specifically, the old generation are Boomers who have spent their entire lives in University and have fallen in love with every left wing cause they tripped over.  They long for the days of true Socialism and the impractical intellectuality that only an egghead could take seriously, and are petrified by what they think is invasion of their little world by barbarians.  They are personified by the hero of the film, a 60 something retired literature professor who has terminal cancer.  The new generation, the barbarians, are personified by the professor's son, a brilliant, but not highly cultured young man who is making a fortune in the financial world and whose politics are to take from the world what you and your family need by cash and chutzpah.  While his father hates technology, the son uses it adeptly to rescue his father from the hell that is the Canadian national health system and arrange for the old man to have a peaceful, comfortable, and dignified death.  As viewer, I sympathized with both characters, both generations, with the defenders of ""civilization"" as well as the barbarian invaders, but found myself routing for the barbarians (both times).  How you respond to this film tells you a lot about yourself, so prepare to feel either depressed or elated at the film's end.  But definitely watch it!",1483488000,4,1579,4.818518518518519
