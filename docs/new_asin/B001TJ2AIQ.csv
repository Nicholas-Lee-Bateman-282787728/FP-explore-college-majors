8341656,4,B001TJ2AIQ,I believe all of the Modern Drummer Festival DVDs are worthwhile for musicians to view. The more knowledge we acquire the better we become.,1434672000,,139,4.833333333333333
8341657,5,B001TJ2AIQ,"Wow, I just can't get enough time for this DVD to digest  it, I needed a full weekend to see it, and to (of course) take note of every tip this masters offers to you. Ndugu Chancler... is Amazing, so are Gavin Harrison & Simon Phillips.",1406073600,,236,4.130434782608695
8341658,5,B001TJ2AIQ,"I bought this DVD for the purpose of watching Simon Phillips' band, but I in fact it's over 11 hours of very inspiring material about fantastic drummers.",1397433600,,153,4.703703703703703

8341660,5,B001TJ2AIQ,"This is a great video!  Thomas Pridgen is frickin Rite On!  I also was introduced to several new drummers that tottaly blew me away; Todd Schukerman is AWESOME!.  One of my favorite drummers, Simon Phillips, is on here doing his magic front and center.  Very good video with lots of examples of jazz, funk, rock, progressive rock, and speed metal (Derreck Roddy).",1293062400,,363,4.806451612903226
8341661,5,B001TJ2AIQ,"Kudos to Modern Drummer for putting on this wonderful festival, and documenting it for all to experience. The production value is of the highest order, and the added features with the lengthy interviews are a real treat. Most importantly the fabulous playing by the greatest drummers in all fields of music is worth the price of admission.",1241222400,,339,4.964912280701754
8341662,5,B001TJ2AIQ,"The annual MD Festival has become a world-class event over the past twenty years, and this latest set continues to raise the bar for superior production AND musicianship.  There are at least four ensembles here, from intimate trios to full-blown bands.  While drums are indeed heavily featured at this show, other musicians will not be bored.  Simon Phillips & Protocol wrapped up the Saturday portion...good thing, because I cannot imagine any other poor band having to follow his group.  Phillips is one of those rare drummers with all the jaw-dropping chops one individual could be blessed with, while possessing a musicality that beggars description!  He is simply one of the best drummers on the planet, and surrounds himself with top-notch players.  This one performance alone is almost worth the price of this DVD.  Bill Stewart is present with his trio, as is Billy Ward.  These sets are always sensory overload for me...there is SO much information here; performances, interviews, etc.  For those who want blazing speed and chops, look no farther than Todd Sucherman  ( Styx ):  he does a phenomenal set, using a laptop for music to accompany him on two or three numbers.  The biggest thing I miss with this package is the inclusion of the latest ""undiscovered"" drumming talent from previous years. That said, this set will keep you busy ""woodshedding"" for a long, long time.",1237852800,3,1384,4.995633187772926
