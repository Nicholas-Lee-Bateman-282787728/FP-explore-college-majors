8674091,5,B00MQVRX4C,"Whether you have all the Gustafer Yellowgold albums or this is your introduction to the Gustafer lore, this is the Sgt. Pepper's of the Gustafer albums.  The whole album is very catchy, but my favorites are Secret Fox, Toothloser and We Got the Bite.  As usual, it is all ages but adults should especially appreciate some of the complexity of the album.  I don't have kids yet, but my cousins are all Gustafer fans and I can't wait to give them this new album for Christmas.",1416009600,,474,4.488372093023256
