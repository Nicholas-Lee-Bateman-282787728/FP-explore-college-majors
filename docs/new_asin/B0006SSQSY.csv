8042973,1,B0006SSQSY,"Interesting and significant in that it is Brian DePalma's first movie, Robert DeNiro's first movie, a very young Jill Clayburgh.  Very 1960s.  Beyond the cultural significance, it is poorly photographed and a disjointed tale.",1470268800,,225,5.588235294117647

8042977,3,B0006SSQSY,"Very loosely structured film, rarely featuring the now-well-known actors on the cover. But fascinating to see so many of them as they were just starting out.",1383264000,2,157,5.076923076923077
8042978,1,B0006SSQSY,Simple Awful. Don't waste time or money on this stinker. This is both DeNiro's and DePalma's first film. They are both lucky they have had long careers in Hollywood because this is not a piece anyone would want on a resume.,1377907200,2,223,4.463414634146342
8042979,5,B0006SSQSY,"This movie is such a classic!  I especially commend the acting talents of not only Robert DeNiro, but that young Judith Thomas!  She was robbed of her oscar in 1969 for her wonderful performance!",974332800,9,195,4.705882352941177
