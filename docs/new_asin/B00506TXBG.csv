4512903,3,B00506TXBG,"I should have looked closer at the distributor. Mill Creek has earned a reputation for putting out shoddy, slapshot work....and this is no exception. First off, the movies are labeled wrong. ""Heartbreak Hotel"" is on the side listed for ""Indian Summer"", and vice versa. Second, the box states that ""Heartbreak Hotel"" is in 1:78, which I was really looking forward to since I've only ever been able to get it in 1:33.  Well, the actual image on the DVD is 1:33. At least they got ""Indian Summer"" right in the 2:35 that it's listed as being.

I only give it 3 stars because I like both movies.",1305331200,2,590,4.5046728971962615

8450769,5,B00506TXBG,"David Keith is the only actor who has captured the essence and the spirit of the late Elvis Presley. He deserved the Oscar.
This movie is a real winner. All of the supporting cast is outstanding. Tuesday Weld is as wonderful as she was in one of
Elvis' greatest films, ""Wild In The Country."" I recommend this to everyone who agrees with the Smithsonian: Elvis was the
greatest entertainer of the 20th century. We will never see his like again in our lifetimes. David Keith is a remarkably fine actor.
I have never seen him in any film in which he was less than excellent. John Kinsey",1444348800,,583,4.457943925233645

8450771,3,B00506TXBG,"I gave this a three star because of the movie Indian Summer, I wasn't  crazy about this movie. I got this movie for Heartbreak Hotel.  I saw this movie years ago. I fell in love with it. David Keith was great in this movie. The singing in it, you could tell what songs Elvis sang from what songs weren't.  This is about  a woman that owns a run down hotel. She drinks and gets beaten up by her boyfriend. She happens to love Elvis and goes to see all his movies. She has two kids, a teenage son and a daughter that is afraid of the dark. The son sees that Elvis is coming to town and decides the best thing for his mom is to have a date with Elvis. The son makes plans on getting Elvis. He kidnaps Elvis with the help of his friends and the pizza lady that looks like Elvis's mom.  Elvis helps her son and daughter out with a number of  problems. The son gives Elvis a number of problems, which Elvis straightened him out of and in the end he told Elvis that he was still the King. I loved this movie.",1393200000,2,1001,4.005025125628141
8450772,4,B00506TXBG,"This DVD Double Feature from Mill Creek includes the movies INDIAN SUMMER and HEARTBREAK HOTEL. INDIAN SUMMER is okay, but I really like HEARTBREAK HOTEL.

In the first movie, INDIAN SUMMER, a group of campers comes back to their beloved Camp Tamakwa for a summer reunion at the invitation of the owner, ""Uncle"" Lou Handler (Alan Arkin). Though many were invited, only eight show up: Jamie Ross (Matt Craven), Beth Warden (Diane Lane), Jack Belston (Bill Paxton), Jennifer Morton (Elizabeth Perkins), Brad Berman (Kevin Pollack), Matthew Berman (Vincent Spano), and Kelly Berman (Jennifer Warner) and Ross' young girlfriend Gwen Daugherty (Kimberly Williams). At dinner, Lou reveals to the group that he intends to sell the camp and retire. He's old and just can't relate to kids the way he used to. The former campers who come for the week all have problems of their own. Some of them are involved in relationships with each other while others wish they were involved in a relationship with each other. Yet, none of them can believe Camp Tamakwa will be no more. Lou runs the former campers through the daily camp rituals and the group begins to bond. For a few brief moments they feel like they are really kids again. They learn, as do so many who attend summer camp, that though summer camp might not be Heaven on Earth, it can give you taste of Heaven and you'll never be the same.

The acting in the movie is solid and though the script is lightly wrapped in sentimentality, it's well written. This is an ensemble picture and often what happens in an ensemble piece is that one or two performers stand out above the rest and one or two aren't as good as the rest. That's not the case in INDIAN SUMMER. The ensemble meshes well and everyone has their own little moments to shine. You really get the sense that these adults were once childhood friends at camp.

The movie also features Sam Raimi (director of the SPIDER-MAN movies) in a small role as Stick Coder, the camp's resident handyman. Raimi has had huge success as a director, but people often forget he's a great comedic character actor.

Personally, I have mixed feelings about INDIAN SUMMER. Watching the movie made me think back to my own experiences at summer camps both as a youth and as an adult working at camps. The movie is well developed and there are some really poignant moments. Yet, the movie is forgettable; I felt good while watching it, but once the movie stopped, that was it. The best films do things to us long after the final credits role, whether starting a discussion, causing one to reflect, provoke a person to take action, etc. To me INDIAN SUMMER was just a movie and nothing more. That's really a shame because it has so much going for it. Of course, that's also what makes it attractable to a larger audience.

Overall, INDIAN SUMMER is a well-executed movie with a talented ensemble cast that meshes extremely well together. However, beyond a few feelings of nostalgia, it didn't move me in any way. It's a movie that like Indian Summer itself, provides a few brief moments of warmth in early fall and then is gone.

The second movie on this DVD is HEARTBREAK HOTEL. Written and directed by Chris Columbus (writer of GREMLINS, director of the first two HOME ALONE movies & the first two HARRY POTTER movies), HEARTBREAK HOTEL is a comedy with a dash of romance. It's a fictional story that takes place in 1972. Johnny Wolfe (Charlie Schlatter) is a high school senior who lives with his younger sister and his mother in a small hotel called the Flaming Star in Taylor, Ohio. Johnny has his own band and they are pretty good and he just wants to play some rock and roll. However, The Wolfetones have never been able to play at the largest gig of the year in Taylor: the annual high school talent competition. Each year the judges come up with some lame excuse about why The Wolfetones (Johnny's band) can't play. Johnny's mother, Marie (Tuesday Weld) loves her kids and is doing her best to raise her kids and run the hotel, but she longs for some romance in her life. Instead, she ends up dating dead-beats. She's also crazy about Elvis. After Marie's latest boyfriend beats her and sends her to the hospital when they are in a car accident, Johnny decides he's going to do something really special for his mom. He's going to get Elvis to go on a date with his Mom. At first Johnny's friends think he's crazy, but soon they are caught up in his crazy idea, too. Elvis is coming to Cleveland and that's where they'll make their move.

The first extended scene with Elvis occurs after his arriving at his hotel in Cleveland. It is here that we see an Elvis that is struggling and on the brink; he's a man on the edge who longs for someone or something to reach out and bring him back inside. In many ways, HEARTBREAK HOTEL is a movie about what could have happened. It makes wonder if something like this had happened, would Elvis have ended up dying in a bathroom floor just five years later.

Like many of Chris Columbus' pictures, HEARTBREAK HOTEL is a little movie with a lot of heart. David Keith portrays Elvis and he does a spectacular job. Keith doesn't look exactly like Elvis, but he embodies the spirit of the man before he was completely corrupted by drugs and alcohol. The Elvis of HEARTBREAK HOTEL is one that loves cheeseburgers, who is used to getting his way, but still tries to appease his fans. At the same time, he's a lonely and broken man who feels he's forgotten and perhaps lost who he really is. This is an Elvis that still has hope.  That hope is given a chance to blossom when Elvis checks into HEARTBREAK HOTEL. It's a feel-good place of second chances that won't always let you feel lonesome tonight.

There are no extras on the DVD for either feature.",1334448000,2,5772,4.5735009671179885
