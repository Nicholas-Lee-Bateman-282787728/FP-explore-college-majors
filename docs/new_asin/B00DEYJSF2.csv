5795598,5,B00DEYJSF2,"Robert Lepage's production of Thomas Ades' new opera ""The Tempest"" exceeded my expectations. It is a thrilling experience to watch and hear. Those who have enjoyed the stage and film versions will particularly enjoy it.",1382140800,,219,5.285714285714286
5795599,5,B00DEYJSF2,"Shakespeare usually has to be considerably reworked when adapted to an opera, meaning that it is necessarily condensed, streamlined and stripped largely of its poetry.  Having a kind of musical element of its own, The Tempest however would appear to be a work that is more open to musical adaptation than most other Shakespeare works.  Considering its scope and range that takes in comedy, family drama and political intrigue, but most notably having a supernatural and musical element that takes in the spirits of the spheres through Ariel and the baseness of the earthy Caliban, the whole drama taking place on a magical island of ""noises sounds and sweet airs"" - The Tempest would appear to be both a challenge and a gift for a capable musician.

Ads manages to integrate all the rich elements of Shakespeare's work wonderfully, not just accompanying the various strands of comedy, drama and romance that are rather compressed in the dramatic playing, but making up for the lack of poetry in the libretto by deepening the sentiments through the musical dimension.  It's not always the most melodic of arrangements, but it's wholly appropriate to the context of the scenes, never discordant and often quite beautiful in its symphonic sweep.  The most difficult element - from the point of view of composition, from the nature of the singing challenges and from the assault on the ears of the listener - is however the tricky characterisation of Ariel.  It's necessary that Ariel appear to be a spirit creature from another, higher dimension, and Ads expresses the pain of his captivity in the highest extremes of the soprano range.  It is by no means easy on the ear or even entirely intelligible, but it does have an otherworldly quality.

That however is just the most extreme example.  Elsewhere Ads shows himself capable of strong individual characterisation that not only enriches expression of each individual character but allows them to coexist and work together.  Simon Keenlyside (reprising a role that he helped create in the original 2004 Covent Garden production of the work) is a commanding presence that brings Prospero to life and brings a necessary degree of humanity to the part. Audrey Luna is simply astonishing as Ariel, as lithe and agile in her movements as in her voice (Lepage effectively keeping Ariel almost exclusively floating up and above or outside the drama as a mischievous but otherworldly sprite), and the casting of Isabel Leonard and Alek Shrader as the beautiful couple of Miranda and Ferdinand - the great hope for the future - could hardly be more perfect.  Leonard's rich and luxurious mezzo-soprano is wonderfully expressive with clear diction and real strength of character, blending wonderfully with Shrader's handsome tenor.

If the singing goes some way towards making a potentially difficult work more accessible, Robert Lepage's stage direction and Jasmine Catudal's clever set designs play their part in helping it all flow together marvellously.  The setting of the first act within a reproduction of the La Scala theatre certainly ties in with the notion of music, theatre, opera and even Prospero's claim to be Duke of Milan, but more than being notional, it provided a conceptual approach to the theatricality of the staging, with figures slipping beneath the platform of the stage and dropping into the prompter's box.  The Native Indian tattoos and markings on Prospero beneath his military greatcoat, with feathers woven into his hair, and the shaman-like appearance of the disinherited Caliban hint at some of the underlying themes in the work relating to colonisation and exploitation of native populations without needing to take this any further and over-complicate the progression of the drama.

With the composer Thomas Ads himself directing the orchestra from the pit, working to the strengths of the singing and to the movements on the stage, this feels like a truly complete opera production, one where all the elements work with and support the other to create that particular magic that only this particular fusion of music and theatre in the highest levels of opera can achieve.",1380844800,7,4148,5.1063515509601185
5795600,5,B00DEYJSF2,I saw this live and later HD. I was familiar with the Ades production through the CD. Keenlyside is remarkable as Prospero...Luna stratospheric as Ariel (and a hoot to watch)...rising singers Isabel Leonard and Alek Shrader a well matched couple. I have no qualms about blue ray (my set isn't large) but chances are it will be available in the future,1378512000,8,350,4.754098360655738
5795601,2,B00DEYJSF2,"The Tempest was one of the Metropolitan Opera's high definition telecasts, which I saw in my local theater and found to be a very fine, even brilliant, production of a very fine opera.  I would purchase a Blu-ray edition of this telecast in an instant, but Deutsche Grammophon has inexplicably decided to issue it solely in standard DVD format.  I will leave it to others to explain why a leading publisher would offer the public an inferior product when a much superior product is readily available.",1378166400,15,500,4.8023255813953485
8592723,4,B00DEYJSF2,"Strange music, but a very entertaining and enjoyable production. I knew Audrey Luna as a college student and it was fun to see her on the Met stage in such a wild physical and vocal role.",1483488000,,187,4.222222222222222
8592724,4,B00DEYJSF2,Tough going musically but a very intelligent production and Keenlyside as Prospero is one of his finest interpretations. The RSC in England should ask him to reprise the role in a spoken version of Shakespeare's last play.,1475798400,,222,5.027027027027027
8592725,5,B00DEYJSF2,"A fantastic production (at the Met, 2012) by Robert Lepage of a new (2004) opera which is I think one of the very few contemporary operas that will find a place in the repertory. Luna is incredibly virtuosic as Ariel, but Keenleyside as Prospero, Alan Oke as Caliban, and all the rest of a large cast and chorus sing and act Ads' music drama with utter conviction. The music is sometimes harsh but often beautifully lyrical - and both are needed for this fine reimagining of Shakespeare's last play.",1434931200,2,499,4.617977528089888
8592726,5,B00DEYJSF2,I'm biased.  Audrey and my daughter graduated high school together.  Were both in Fiddler on the Roof production in H.S.,1420243200,,120,4.95
8592727,5,B00DEYJSF2,"Great DVD and excellent delivery.
However, Amazon's lost ability to detect that  this DVD was already purchased once before in the past by same person and delivered to same address (as it used to be!), leads the purchaser to lose trust and confidence in what used to be a reliable Amazon operation.",1406419200,,298,4.730769230769231
8592728,5,B00DEYJSF2,"Let's talk about an original classic and a classic reworking of the original.  Thomas Ades is a baby, compared to the other composers on the arena.  He is also gay,  and as gifted as a contemporary Mozart.  I know the play practically from memory (English major, anyone?), and had already seen that other masterpiece adaptation  of it, ""Enchanted Island"", also from the Met.  Audrey Luna is simply stratospheric in the most difficult soprano role I have ever heard (Again, Mozart, by way of Cirque de Soleil).  Keenlyside is a force of nature as Prospero, but so is Allan Okb as Caliban.  Alex Shrader and Isabel Leonard are the dessert on a banquet of sound. It has left me breathless. Why has no one mentioned that Prospero, Caliban and Miranda exhibit costumes inspired by Maori culture?",1400716800,5,790,4.8
8592729,5,B00DEYJSF2,"Like this opera very much, good message, very good performance, music and good singers.  Of course Simon Keenlyside as always with his lovely voice and personality.",1392422400,,164,5.3076923076923075
8592730,5,B00DEYJSF2,"Thomas Ades ""The Tempest"" is the mystical, spirit filled, good vs evil side of Shakespeare's Play.  Nearly all of the mistaken identities and comedy are left out except for two characters who provide comic relief.  The use of a soprano as one of the two men suggesting cross dressing of one of the comic relief characters is the only bow to that side of Shakespeare's play.  The opera concentrates on the interactions of Prospero, Miranda, Ferdinand, Caliban, and Ariel.  The King of Naples grieves heavily and well for his supposedly lost son, Ferdinand.  Sebastian comes across well as the not so popular, nor gifted, scheming second son.

The singing is superb, in an obviously very difficult score. The harmonic jumps and the strange accents both Prospero and Arial make are well done and suit their characters.  It just is not easy to listen to.  Miranda and Ferdinand sing several lovely love duets.  Isabel Leonard as Miranda does a great job of contrasting her character to that of Simon Keenlyside, her father, Propero.  Alek Schrader portrays the exceedingly handsome, ethical, popular prince very well.  Alek even manages to sing well tied in a Crucifixion posture.  John del Carlo as the bass Gonzalo is fantastic, and his summary aria in the last act is one of the opera's highlights.  Even the chorus gets into the acting with their surprise at being clean and well dressed after the storm, the despair and fatigue after wandering the island, and their surprise and marveling at the sudden appearance of ""provisions,"" an elaborately set supper, candelabras and all, worthy of any palace.

The staging and costumes are marvelous, imaginative, and clearly indicate the nature of the characters.  Ferdinand in all white is every bit the hero.  Caliban in a see through black outfit, and Prospero, shirtless with lots of weird tattoos, are obviously the villains.  Ariel in a tight body suit of pale purple ruffles is as other worldly as possible.  The island is portrayed as mystical and makes a good backdrop, used very effectively in several different ways through the opera.

The orchestra does very well, leading the singers without overpowering them.  The composer, Thomas Ades, conducted.  He could have been a bit more formal, but the unshaven look with a loose tshirt looking shirt under a black coat is in vogue for conductors.

The production, by Robert LePage, is very well done.  Characters keep crawling out of prompting boxes and from under the raised portions of the stage.  The scene of Ferdinand being pulled by his arms through the middle of the floor of the stage is very effective.  The only scene I did not like was Sebastian backing off stage talking about dying. While he is feeling lost and has lost his heritage,  It is not made clear to the audience what happened to him.  The dvd quality is good.  The camera work is good with appropriate closeups of the characters.

Overall, this is a production well worth seeing and having in one's library of modern opera.",1391385600,13,2998,4.892857142857143
8592731,5,B00DEYJSF2,"It took me three viewings to appreciate all the nuances of this performance.  While I have not had the opportunity to read this play, I loved this performance. The singing is excellent and the sets are magnificent, as was the staging of the performance. This has become a staple in my DVD collection of classical music.",1387411200,,319,4.696428571428571
8592732,5,B00DEYJSF2,"Just about the best modern opera, ever? Thomas Ades is a great composer, and he sticks quite closely to the Shakespeare original. The staging is brilliant, and I have to single out Audrey Luna for (a) the most amazing virtuoso soprano work I have ever heard, and (b) bringing Ariel to life in a costume design and makeup straight from Lady Gaga. The entire cast is brilliantly chosen. If only there were more modern operas of this astonishing quality.",1383436800,9,451,4.7215189873417724
