8000840,1,B0000DFXVU,"This DVD depicting Shirley Temple on the cover is a deliberate deception. It's a lure to sell a 1960's version of Heidi.  It does this not only by not specifying the versions of the movies, but by implication: the Shirley Temple version of ""Heidi"", ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"", and ""The Little Princess"" were all products of the 1930's and could be reasonably classed together.  Also, there was a section of ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" where the image actually had streaks, as if the film were slipping.  The sound was often muffled. I've never been aware of either of these defects when seeing the movie on TV.  A shoddy product.",1107561600,35,624,4.803738317757009
8000841,1,B0000DFXVU,This is NOT the Heidi with Shirley Temple as the picture on the cover leads you to believe! That is the only reason I bought this DVD and I did not get the one film I wanted!,1105228800,21,174,3.72972972972973
