3028964,5,B000YH8V00,"I already had taped The Pride of Jesse Hallam starring Johnny Cash with some great songs, and had watched it a lot. I had only seen The Death of Richie on TV many years ago so it was great to be able to buy both on one DVD. This is not a double-sided disc, but both movies are on the same side. There is no menu or coming features. You put the disc on, and The Pride of Jesse Hallam begins. When it ends, you do nothing as The Death of Ritchie starts playing on its own. While this is an advantage if you want to watch both, or just The Pride of Jesse Hallam, it may be a slight problem if you only want to watch The Death of Ritchie. With The Pride, you follow Jesse from selling his farm in Kentucky and moving to Ohio so his daughter with scoliosis could be operated on, to finally learning how to do something he never had. Jesse enrolls his son in school and goes about finding himself a job. The one he finds is for a guy named Sal selling fruit and vegetables who happens to be the father of Marion, the assistant principal at the school Theodore (Ted) is enrolled in. When Sal finds out Jesse's secret, he talks his daughter into teaching him. When Jesse finds out his own son Ted is developing the same problem, he decides it is time both of them learned, and that is how the movie ends. In Ritchie, we follow the downward spiral of a boy who begins the movie getting high on drugs. When his parents are told by the court that he needs to be placed in a rehabilitation center, they choose to find him employment. While that works for a while, his druggie buddies pull him back into the drug scene. His behavior gets more violent and threatening, till the day he accosts his father in the basement with a knife, which ends with his death as is apparent by the title of the movie. Both leave me with totally different feelings, but the two movies work very well together. Not all experiences end happily and we need to keep that in mind. The path we choose affects how we live and die, and a contrast such as these give you would hopefully help some viewers make better choices in their lives.",1274659200,4,2100,4.213399503722084

3028966,3,B000YH8V00,"This 1977 movie is very dated by today's production standards.  Robbie Benson was really beginning to make a name for himself back then but I didn't find him all that convincing in this movie, particularly having read the book it is based upon before I saw the movie.  In the book Richie becomes more and more belligerent and disrepectful and given the content restrictions on language and such back then, Richie's behavior loses some of its impact.  The movie would've been far more believable and impactful if it had the license of really showing Richie as the book depicts him.

Ben Gazzara, as Richie's father George, does very well in this movie and is believable as a man who cannot express and connect with his own emotions, much less understand his son who is out of control.  Eileen Brennan as Carol, Richie's mother, isn't as good.  The movie just doesn't get at how ineffective she was in trying to mediate between her husband and their son.

The climactic scene where Richie threatens his parents with a weapon and George tries to back him off with his revolver is very gripping.  Does George kill Richie because he's genuinely scared of him or is he abetting his son's suicide?  In the end a grand jury refused to indict George.

I think this movie, were it made today, would be much better although I think it really shocked people back in the day.",1254355200,3,1362,4.6375

3028968,5,B000YH8V00,"This is a must see for anyone who knows of someone who struggles to come to terms with addiction. This film was based on Thomas Thompson's critically acclaimed May 1972 Life magazine article and subsequent 1973 novel ""Richie"".

Thompson's story of the Diener family and their battle with oldest son Richie is very accurately displayed in this made-for-TV movie. Benson brings to life the true embodiment of the shy and insecure teen Richie who longs to meet the approval of all of those around him.

The story of Richie Diener was one of the first to highlight the issues families face when dealing with a teen and drug abuse. This was all uncharted waters in the early to mid-70's when drug rehabilitation was very limited and in its infancy.",1209340800,11,743,4.751937984496124
3028969,4,B000YH8V00,"I saw this years after it's release when the High School teacher ran it for us.
It is a fairly decent account of parents and children drifting apart and never really being able to bridge troubled waters.
I always think of Robbie Benson as an Actor i enjoyed and i know that he is happy doing production work and other things in the movie world,but if he does appear in something and he still does at times,he is an actor that i always felt was sold short with a pretty teen tag for the girls and not much more,this could not be any further from the truth and you can tell he had the skill and ability to have acted in many parts.
It is not something that is always mentioned about this movie,but it was based closely on a true story.
The thing that rings most unreal in the end is Richie's father resorting to shoot him.
He was never very dangerous,just totally numb from drugs.
One of the lines that stayed with me was when Richie's mother asked him to cut out smoking those cigarettes,and he shot back(I cant,i can't do it).
Why he never had medical help is a real mystery.

I also read the book several times before I watched the movie. While I thought Benson was a pretty decent actor, it's just not this character. This is a grueling, and very sad movie.
