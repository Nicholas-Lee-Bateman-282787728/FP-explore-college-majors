I had to set my dvd player on my laptop to region 3 to play it.  If you don't yet know, you can change regions up to a maximum of 4 times.  Anyway, the movie is very sweet amd touching.  But is also about a deep themes such as true love and chance or fate.  I really liked the story and it left me thinking about how strong the desire for love can be and how chance happenings can have a profound effect on our lives.",1353888000,4,582,3.889830508474576
