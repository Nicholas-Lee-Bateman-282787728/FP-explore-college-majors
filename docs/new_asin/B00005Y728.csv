1675361,4,B00005Y728,"This is an intriguing glimpse at a vanishing tradition among a little known people in one of the world's most(harshly) beautiful and romantic territories.

This film deals with the same people, if not the same individuals, as the book ""Nomads of Western Tibet"" by Melvyn C. Goldstein and Cynthia M. Beall,&nbsp;] and the two complement each other nicely.  The book is highly recommended for those interested in more about this culture, and the photography, if anything, is even more stunning.

The film concentrates on four men as they mount their yearly expedition with pack animals to collect salt at a distant lake or salt-pan.  Formerly, many groups made the trip, and it was a mainstay of their economy.  Now, due to competition from salt gatherers using trucks, it is barely profitable and fewer and fewer make the effort.

The focus is narrowly on the trip and preparation, and the process of gathering salt once they've arrived, all of which is surrounded by centuries of custom and ritual (there is even a secret language spoken only on the salt trip).  But we learn much of the more general culture as it impinges during or before the expedition.  It largely could have been filmed a hundred years ago, though occasional telephone/power lines or a passing truck intrude jarringly.

Except for a brief comment at the end, the story is told entirely in the images and (subtitled) sounds captured by the camera.  The subjects do speak at length, for if not to the camera, and talk about much of what they are doing, but still some context (even a map) would have been appreciated. [An optional commentary track on the DVD would have been an excellent way to provide this.]  Even if the filmmakers were not to add a Western, anthropological, viewpoint (for instance, pointing out that when the women are not allowed to go on the expedition, this might have something to do with their being indispensible to the running of the main encampment), the exigencies of filming don't let them provide all the context that would be there for a person on the spot.  For instance, at one point there is a sequence where one of the saltmen ladles steaming brownish liquid into a small churn -- is this tea which he is mixing with butter in the Tibetan fashion, or is it yak milk, or ...?  We aren't there, didn't observe what went before and after, and can't even smell the steam.

Nonetheless, this is a fascinating look at this one aspect of the nomads' life, even if it lacks something in context and narrative connectivity.

Obligatory complaint: the subtitles are quite hard to read against the light tones of the landscape, which seriously distracts from watching the film itself.  Better technology for displaying them does exist.",1078099200,42,2731,4.815845824411135
1675362,4,B00005Y728,"This is a wonderful and touching documentary.  A German film entirely in Tibetan with optional English subtitles. The film follows four Tibetan Salt men as they make a month long journey to the salt flats to harvest salt for their tribe.  To the salt men the journey is a holy pilgrimage full of its own rituals and spiritual meaning.
They take a caravan of yak on its journey and reminisce about the past and how the price of salt has gone down and how they no longer meet as many salt men from other tribes.  They go over some of their legends and mythology with the cameraman to give us a better understanding of there culture and teaching.
The documentary is set so the Tibetans tell their own story to the backdrop of Tibet and its mountains and harsh weather.  The story is compelling and it leads you into lives of the salt men so much that you can appreciate their loss and concerns when one of the yaks falls ill.
The tradition of the salt men is a dying culture; one of the most poignant moments in the documentary is when the salt men arrive at the salt flats after spending weeks traveling t only to find someone harvesting salt and loading it into the back of a truck. The honking of the trucks horn sounds the death knell of the salt man culture.
I recommend this fascinating and compelling story.",1064793600,32,1311,4.404958677685951
7956746,5,B00005Y728,"""The Saltmen of Tibet""shows how four Tibetans travel with their yak caravan to the holy salt lakes in Northern Tibet, to harvest the precious salt. The visuals are breathtakingly beautiful.

Having traveled Tibet I have seen some scenes likes the ones depicted in the movie, however, the landscapes in Northern Tibet are even pristine, probably because nobody lives there, the conditions are too tough.

Most interestingly, the men are nomads who move around with their yak herds so the yaks can feed. They live in yurts which considering the high elevation with big temperature changes must be difficult. Yet all of them, including the women and younger people seems perfectly in balance with themselves, nature and their gods. This is one of the things that amazed we the most when traveling in the part of the world, everybody is always happy, nobody seems to be jealous, cranky, dissatisfied or have any other remotely negative feeling.

The smallest actions, like drinking tea with yak milk have ceremonial character, every second is enjoyed and valued.

Highly recommend, this is a stunning portrait of precious people, landscapes, and individual moments.

Profoundly beautiful, beginning with a Tibetan woman singing the traditional Salt Song passed down from forever. I bought it to be sure I get repeat viewings of this obscure document of a rare slice of Himalayan life.",1395792000,,319,4.714285714285714
7956749,5,B00005Y728,"Not only are viewers ""embedded"" with a welcoming and sincere group of nomads on their salt gathering journey, but the film opens with a sequence featuring a famous female ""Gesar"" singer.  This is a rare and fine piece of documentary footage over looked by other commentators.  The Gesar epic is perhaps the world's longest epic and it is the great epic shared among peoples in Central Asia in and bordering the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Himalayas. The nomads are entranced by the telling of an episode in song and verse.

Sad that this epic is little know to western audiences.  Time for it to come out of the shadows of time to thrill us all.  Hope more people will collect and thereby help preserve this film.",1392249600,,711,4.656

7956752,4,B00005Y728,"You'd think a 110 minute film about the nomadic salt collectors of Tibet might get a tad tedious.  How much can there be to tell, after all, about scraping up salt from a lake, bagging it, and carrying it back to the village?

Not much, actually.  So it was to the audience's benefit, and to the director's credit, that he let the camera do the talking.  In simple documentary style, with no narration and unobtrusive background music, the film crew follow a group of four men who make the annual trek from their summer camping grounds to Lake Tsentso to collect salt. We watch them as they plan the expedition, collecting yaks from members of the community that will carry back the salt, initiating a new member into their fold, and making the ritual offerings to propitiate the gods and ask their favor in making a successful journey.  The group sets out with over 160 yaks on a month-long trek across rugged and beautiful landscape, the struggle of the journey made all the more touching by buses, cars, and lorries whizzing past on a nearby road.  These men will be perhaps the last generation to collect salt in the traditional manner.  They seem to be aware of this, which makes their journey all the poignant, The Saltmen of Tibet all that more precious for documenting a culture in its dying days.

7956753,5,B00005Y728,"This is a very nicely done documentary.  No voice over, no attempts at sullying explanations.  The footage speaks for itself.  A strange issue with this documentary is the relative dearth of information available about who is featured in the film or where it takes place.  Perhaps this lends to the mystery of the characters and their journey, but to the viewer it's perplexing.  Another issue is the music which is occasionally added to the film.  It is mostly sparse and atmospheric, but it takes away from the authenticity of the experience.",1227484800,,544,4.923076923076923
7956754,4,B00005Y728,"Salt gathering and trade has been an important commerce of humanity in the past. Many mountainous regions developed their economy according to the possibility of salt exchange. Tibet in particular has a salt commerce (salt for grain) dating from pre-historical age. Salt was gathered from high altitude lakes (sacred lakes) and brought to the plains and to India by yak caravans. These long-lasting traditions are rapidly disappearing because of the opening of roads (truck transport) and recently of the Tibetan railway in high altitude regions. Recently two movies have been dedicated to salt caravans in Tibet: ""Himalaya"" by Eric Valli and this documentary by Ulrike Koch.
This important ethnological documentary follows for three months a small salt gathering caravan of four men in the Chantang region. The filmed period goes from the preparation of the expedition, with chants and religious ceremonies, to the trip, the salt-gathering and the return trip. The four men are followed in all their cumbersome daily activities and are left to speak to the listener without being interviewed. The camera is usually still so we are able to follow only what goes in and out of our visual field and this gives an impression of  reality. The landscapes are those of the Himalayan altitudes (over 4500 m) and the colours are spectacular. Naturally the pace of the documentary is very slow, but as others have noted, it is hypnotic and can be followed without too much yawning. The merit of this work surely resides in its anthropological value, but it can be enjoyed as an intelligent distraction to our only to easy life and we can think about it when we ask someone to ""pass us the salt"".",1153180800,4,1686,4.9787234042553195
7956755,4,B00005Y728,"Ulrike Koch's documentary The Saltmen of Tibet is really a remarkable movie, but I should probably warn you about its almost funereal pace. Though the film chronicles a long journey undertaken by four Tibetan ""saltmen,"" it's not a very dramatic journey. There are no life-or-death experiences to speak of here---except to a beloved yak---and there is no tension between these four Tibetans as there might be in a fiction film. Basically, some people might (maybe rightfully) find this film tedious.

I didn't. Koch is not aiming for high drama with The Saltmen of Tibet. I think this movie is meant to be an elegy of sorts: a requiem for a dying way of life. The Tibetan culture that is explored in parts of this film stands so steadfastly to beliefs and customs that might seem hopelessly antiquated to us today that watching them go through daily rituals or watching the four saltmen agonize over the fate of that precious yak gets us to reflect on our modern way of life. Whatever you may think after watching this movie about the way things have changed is, of course, your own personal reaction. Koch makes no judgments; she simply records, and expects us to watch carefully. And the stately pace helps to put us in a unusually receptive frame of mind. The result is strangely fascinating and hypnotically beautiful---and a little elegiac too. Modernization may be dooming this oddly touching way of life to extinction; after you watch this film, perhaps that thought will give you pause.

The Saltmen of Tibet may not be for everyone, and may not be a movie worth more than one viewing. Still, it is definitely worth seeing, for the fascinating culture it chronicles and for the reflection it generates in a viewer willing to think about the film's implications about our modern way of life.
