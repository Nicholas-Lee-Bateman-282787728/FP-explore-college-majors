8057212,5,B00094AS4K,"Loved, loved this DVD,
As a model photographer I enjoyed all the features & interviews,, and the overall layout is entertaining in itself.

I bought 2, gave one to a model, and may yet purchase another... as it's damn unique and , to me inspiring.",1308960000,,247,4.488888888888889
8057213,4,B00094AS4K,"Great, sexy and honest photos. Taken with no lighting, no big production and no super model. If you are into fetish photography this is a good product. But if you just curious the DVD contents is a bit slow and could get a bit boring. Enjoy.",1227398400,,241,4.260869565217392
8057214,4,B00094AS4K,Interseting DVD. Makes for good background during a dinner party. I feel Steve Diet Goedde photography is best in print and the DVD loses something in the translation. The interviews with the models are funny and reminds you why they are models. All in all a good value.,1140652800,,270,4.645833333333333
8057215,5,B00094AS4K,"""We often have fantasies that we're John-Malkovitvching though the lives of our favorite pornographers and erotic adventurers; though usually while eating Cheetoes on the couch and watching porn. Now we can continue that fine Fleshbot tradition with one of our favorite kinky photographers Steve Diet Goedde and his new DVD, ""Living Through Steve Diet Goedde."" Goedde combines classic photos with new material, model interviews and documentaries, and we get to see plenty of yummy Aria Giovanni and Dita Von Teese to boot. It's almost like being there ourselves, except we don't have to move around very much, which we like.""--fleshbot",1113782400,3,635,5.36
