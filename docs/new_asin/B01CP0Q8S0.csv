7685679,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"The Movie Review by Andy McKinney
Allegiant
 In this, the third episode in the Divergent series, the teen age protagonists get beyond the fence, the huge barrier that separates post apocalypse Chicago from what ever might beckon beyond.  Fans will know that the society in Chicago has defined factions, each based upon an attribute or attitude.  The Dauntless faction, brave and hearty, provides the police function, Erudite the thinkers and so forth.  The Divergent people are those with no faction, outcast and friendless.  In the turmoil depicted, a band of teens of assorted factions makes a break for the far horizons.
 The producers did spend a huge amount of money making a film that is mostly eye candy at the cost of heart.  If we did not already know and care for the main characters from the previous two films, we wouldn't care a trice what happens to them in this movie.  We do get to see the outer world, which of course we wondered about.  The high tech parts of the outer wold we like very much, lots of neet-o future tech to play with.  But the society seems to have slipped into a moral regression in the 200 years since the last big war wrecked everything.  By slipped, I mean plunged deeply into the foul nether regions of the human heart.
 But enough of that.  We have to get through this film in order to reach number four in the series, so complaining will not help us.
 Returning to her leading role we have the capable Shailene Woodley and the less capable but beefy Theo James.  Neither of them are strained very strongly by tough acting assignments, which is a shame in Woodley's case, she could handle a real acting chore if handed one.  We are not nearly as confident of Theo James' ability but the occasion doesn't come up.  Lots of other important or at least famous players back up the two leads.  Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer (also appearing by voice this week in ""Zootopia""), Maggie Q. and the beautiful Zoe Kravitz lead the female actors.  Jeff Daniels pushes on in a badly written role while Ray Stevens appears in a brief scene.
  The over complicated plot and uninspiring flow of action might come from the original novels by Veronica Roth or perhaps by the three other writers with their thumbs in the ink of the screen play.  Or perhaps by interference by the studio bean counters protecting their gigantic $110 million investment.  I can't blame director Robert Schwentke.  He after all also directed the previous ""Insurgent"" and to a much more satisfactory conclusion.  He also has directed the vastly entertaining ""RED"" and the well received ""The Time Traveler's Wife"".  I think maybe the studio just let the budget get in the way of the story, which at bottom is about teen age romance, teen age kids throwing off adult restraint and the survival of the human race.  It isn't about extremely cool future stuff, fun as that might be.  It is the story and the people that we want to see.
  I can award only a sub-par two and a half saw blades for ""Allegiant"" which  disappoints me.  The PG-13 film runs for a good solid two hours and one minute.  Even if I didn't much care for this installment, the fan base if so large that the producers are sure to get their money back.  It took in a very tasty $82 million over the three day opening weekend.
 One more movie in the series to go.  More story, please, next time.",1458432000,12,3357,4.564489112227806
7685680,5,B01CP0Q8S0,"If you love books, or like the series so far or are interested in seeing this film, just see it for your self, you'll probably enjoy it. I can say its WAY Better than Insurgent and though the film does have its flaws it is a very enjoyable film. Also, the film is technically Allegiant Part 1 with Allegiant Part 2 (Ascendant) out by next year but this film IS NOT one half of a full story like other Part 1 films are (ex. Twilight: Breaking Dawn)",1458345600,5,447,4.149425287356322

7685683,2,B01CP0Q8S0,"The movie was very good and definitely left you hanging. New in the box and wasn't damaged. The reason I knocked off stars was because the digital code is good in Canada ONLY. No where in the description stated that. No where. I only buy movies with digital codes so my family can watch them anywhere since we are always on the go. I am not satisfied with having a code I am unable to use.  If it said somewhere in the description that it was for Canada only, I would take responsibility and chalk it up as a mistake. But even having someone else look at the items page, he was unable to see it stated either.",1533859200,,609,4.161016949152542

All the other Divergent movies came with VUDU Digital Copies. I'm afraid to put the DVDs themselves in, I'm pretty sure it's all set to play in Spanish.",1531526400,,466,4.367816091954023

7685699,1,B01CP0Q8S0,"So my wife and I thought, ""Hey, it's a boring Sunday afternoon, I'm bored, whatever happened to that divergent series?"" So she got the popcorn ready with this amazing stuff I highly recommend it's called ""Kernel Season's White Cheddar seasoning."" Anyway, so I got the movie rented and we sat down and in about five minutes it goes from a dystopian world to this weird SiFi stuff that looked like it had a slightly better budget then some SYFY channel stuff. The actors looked like they didn't care and it showed. The main bad guy is Joey from Full House and not once did he say, ""Cut, It, Out."" Which if you were from the 90's you'd get that reference. I didn't read the book, but wife wife did an apparently they changed the ending which I understand if the ending of the book doesn't adapt well on screen and well, this ending didn't adapt well on screen either so really it's crap on a cracker for the whole movie.",1530144000,,917,4.4

7685729,4,B01CP0Q8S0,"I have to admit this was my least favorite of the Divergent series.

But - at the end I noticed, the very last minute of the film, something that I didn't see the first time I watched this, previously. And that made me wonder if there was another film too? I had assumed that there were three movies, just like there are three books {which I haven't read, or I guess I would have noticed the first time I watched this movie that the story hadn't been finished?} So, then I Googled it - and sure enough, there was SUPPOSED to be a third film to finish this series, but it was delayed, and now it seems that it won't ever be made. Which is a HUGE disappointment, since I loved the movies so far. {This one is good too, just my least fave of the three.}",1521590400,2,750,4.1020408163265305

The second movie strayed from the book but still kept a similar plot.

The third movie completely didn't follow the book besides the fact that a group left and tried to save Chicago.

If you watched the movies and liked them, don't read the books because ignorance is bliss. Although I understand why they'd change the ENTIRE ending to make it more satisfying for the watchers....",1515456000,,443,4.582278481012659

7685775,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"Went too far from the books, which went downhill after the first one anyway.  If you love the books, approach the movies with caution.  If you haven't read the books, watch the movies first and you will be pleasantly surprised at how good the books are (except the last book.  It's only okay.)  Theo and Shailene did a good job in the lead roles though.  A few other casting decisions were questionable i.e.  I didn't think the actress playing Four's mother was believable in the role at all.  Too young, and couldn't stand up to the strength of Four and Tris's characters.",1508630400,,573,4.5588235294117645

My hubby and I love the Divergent movie series and were sorely disappointed that they didn't finish the story. Apparently it didn't do well at the box office or subsequent sales so they scrapped it. This movie has something in it for everyone though: mystery, romance, and action. I liked it just as well as the other two. There are some intense scenes and one steamy one so I recommend it for older children. I so wish they had finished the story. Guess I need to read the books...",1506470400,,554,4.4411764705882355

To keep the movie time reasonable, they chopped things out, but the basic story was the same. Insurgent started fine, but so much was changed that it completely changed the love story.

7685897,4,B01CP0Q8S0,"If Divergent was a strong and promising start then Insurgent severely fumbled the ball. Fortunately as the story grows Allegiant picks up the fumble and dashes toward a touchdown. If you're like me you will sometimes get tired of the main characters getting their heads constantly turned around as was happening throughout Insurgent. Its still happening in Allegiant but we are given a much clearer picture by this movies end than in the previous installment. We are also given an initially cleaner relationship between Theo and Tris but the cracks are showing and they're showing not because they are growing apart but because of distrust, something that pops up in many relationships. Meanwhile Allegiant balances other power players such as Theos mom Evelyn of the factionless revolution and Johannas allegiant movement coming closer to open war. But the biggest reveal is spread out as the movies centerpiece and involves what lies beyond the wall and what or who controls Chicago from the outside, and why. Just as Tris is enticed to believe a story and doesnt know if its true or false, if she should trust or reject it, neither do we. And while we can sympathize with her decision at movies end, maybe well find that she made the wrong one? (I doubt it but its structured for this possibility and that makes the movie more interesting. Remember: a good lie has an awful lot of truth sprinkled into it.)",1490486400,,1409,4.850622406639004

After that it all deteriorated. I personally think that the main reason why the last film did not work is that the last book did not work and the ending was so disappointing that it is difficult to make that work.
Obviously this is my opinion.

7685942,1,B01CP0Q8S0,"I loved the first movie!  What a movie it was!  I saw it three times.  There were some changes from the book, but nothing that made it less than the book.  I've read all the books, and I don't mind revisions for cinematic reasons, but this was a complete rewrite and a very poor one at that.  I remember reading the book this one was based on and thinking, wow, this scene would be so cool and that scene could work so well.  None of it was in the movie.  What was in the movie was the characters in the book in a completely different story.  This is just wrong.  And the ending was one of the poorest endings I've ever seen.  A gas that is supposed to be a great threat is released, and moves quickly here, and slowly there and is visible, so it can be avoided (right).  It's just dumb.  I wonder what the author thought.  I doubt that she is at fault in any way for this atrocity.  I could be wrong, I suppose.
Do yourself a favor and just watch the first movie.  Again.",1487289600,2,972,4.068783068783069

7686033,1,B01CP0Q8S0,"(SPOILER WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)

Wow, this movie took the whole series down hard.  One of my pet peeves with movie series these days is when they completely change the character of one of the cast late in the series.  Here you have Triss suddenly change from trusting almost no one, to trusting a man she just met who is obviously separating her from the man she's supposed to love, turning her back on the only people she cares about for some ""work"" they are doing to help ""damaged"" people.

This movie just kept getting worse as it went on and sadly it did so poorly in theaters that they may not even finish the series.  What a rip off all the way around.  Started with a pretty good series, to not only try and ruin it, but after making millions off the first two, not even finish, terrible.",1483574400,10,803,4.355704697986577

The consensus was that this movie was beyond bad. Worse than the original.  Plot is stupid...characters are weak...shallow and just are boring.  This is a Facebook movie where there are lots of things said with...nothing being said....the overall story and acting are dumb, intellectually lazy....and just they type of movie you would watch ...only if zombies attacked and your VHS machine had broken.  You would seek refuge in your 8 track before looking at this stupidity. .  Yes...this movie is that bad...",1483574400,,651,4.881818181818182

7686170,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"It's okay.  My daughter loves these books.  Since I really haven't paid much attention to the previous movies myself, I thought I would just watch this one and see what it's all about.  It would probably help to start from the beginning and go back and watch this one again.  The acting is not bad and there is some great action scenes but it is a little hard to understand going into it blind without the back story.  Anyway, that is the reason for my rating.  Might try again if I ever watch the prior offerings.",1479772800,,514,4.302083333333333

7686184,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"Like most people, I read the books long before the movies were even mentioned. I enjoyed the books thoroughly and when the movies were announced, I couldn't wait. I'm not sure how others are, but when I read a book, I picture how I think things will be. And it drives me absolutely bonkers when the movie comes along with the title of a pretty fantastic book and it's an absolute (HORRIFYINGLY absolute!) flop--nothing like the book AT ALL. I'll agree that the first movie was pretty close to the book. There were a few characters that they should have developed to aid the plot line, but they didn't. Insurgent was still pretty good...Some details are changed, others left out completely and some of the special effects are bad. Then along comes ""Allegiant""....I'm being nice giving it a 3 star rating. I don't really feel like it deserves that. While the characters are the same, the plot line is nothing like book. This turned into a sci-fi movie 10-15 minutes in and there was no turning back. The special effects were pretty bad, too...You could tell when they were using a green screen and when something was fake. And then to find out that they are making a PART TWO?! Come on! While some may like this, I didn't. This is my own personal opinion...It strayed WAY too far from the book to be good.",1479254400,,1303,4.548936170212766

7686186,5,B01CP0Q8S0,"I like the movie better than the book; in the book she dies. I heard that they cut the book in half and were going to make a fourth movie, but I like how this movie ended in hope.",1479254400,,179,3.6153846153846154
7686187,5,B01CP0Q8S0,"I'm an avid reader and usually hate when movies divert from the original storyline... however, with this one, I was THRILLED!! It was entertaining, gripping, and held to the overall feel of the characters. I actually think they made the story (dare I say it..) better! I can't believe this didn't do well in box offices... Probably because most people hated how the book ended. If you hated the book, I think you'll actually like the movie... wink, wink.",1479254400,,454,4.7594936708860756

7686198,4,B01CP0Q8S0,"I love this series! My only beef with this movie is that they left it with an unfinished feel like they are going to make another, which means that once again, a three part book series is going to end up being a four part movie series. I understand the makers wanting to squeeze a little extra income out of it, but I don't think the extension was necessary.",1478908800,,358,4.202898550724638

7686201,2,B01CP0Q8S0,Movie is probably great but It was useless for me. I paid for the 48 hr rental and thought I would watch the #2 in this series first. Big mistake on my part. I figured the #2 would be free prime by now or at least a cheap rental. Nope I would have had to buy it for $9. My mistake for not checking. Did not watch it so I wasted $4.95. I will wait for another year. I learned a valuable lesson  though. Don't assume that Prime lasts for very long.,1478736000,,446,3.847826086956522

7686297,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"The standard set by the original is not upheld in this, the third in the series. I wanted to see the saga continue, rented and watched it but didn't really enjoy it. My feeling is it was relatively shallow and not particularly well acted and that's on top of it not being a very interesting story line.

7686377,2,B01CP0Q8S0,"This was not very good. After all the progress and growth the main character had in the previous movie she completely reverted in this movie. Tris who is supposed to be in love with 4 once they get to outside encampment she doesn't listen to him anymore and believes David.....huh??? After all Tris has been through so much and learned a lot then to act so foolish in this film seems like bad writing which I attribute to the greed of the studio. I'm sure the studio thought let's divide up the last installment into two movies to make more money but the story suffers in the end. Hopefully Tris regains her confidence and common sense in the next film instead what we got in this movie. David as a bad guy wasn't very smart or tough to be the villain. He brings Tris to the council where after one question she learns David has been lying to her the whole time. That didn't seem very smart on David's part that his lie came out so easy, then she isn't outraged at all just merely confused so they ride back to Chicago back together awkwardly. Then there is Peter who is constantly jumping back and forth between sides and betrays Tris yet again. The fact that neither side has gotten sick of him enough to kill him is baffling to me. I still like the storyline and concept but they need to do a better job in the next film",1476662400,2,1323,4.296

Given all three of those factors, if I had to choose again knowing what I know now, I would wait until it made it to Prime if I watched it at all.

I know that in general I think books are better than movies and in this case that could not be more true.  This movie really veered away from the book and was so different it really annoyed me.  Now, had I not read the books, I probably would have liked the movie more but I could not get past all of the changes from the book.

The cast in the movie was great.  I really love Shailene Woodley and Theo James.  I loved them in the first two movies and they were great in this movie.  It was just the story line that really bugged me.  So if you haven't read the books, you will most likely enjoy this movie but if you have read the books be ready for some major changes.  I know many didn't like the way the books ended, but I felt like the ending in the books had to happen.",1476144000,8,931,4.038251366120218

7686458,4,B01CP0Q8S0,"I had to go watch this movie series just to justify the mixed ratings I read.

Well, I have to say, In My Opinion, there was more going on in this movie that was unrealistic and slow than favorable / enjoyable moments.

So, personally, I won't hold fire against the comments that rated this movie below a 7. I actually would say they are right on target.

I have to say movie quality has certainly went down over the last 6 yrs. I'm beginning to believe many directors and movie industries are expecting movie goers will watch anything with engaging previews to suck us in and torture us with the rest of the movie being BAD.

I am a sci-fi fantasy type movie lover, loving the tech and all that stuff, however, there is a threshold as to what I enjoy watching when it comes to this type of movie genre and this movie just don't quite get there for me. Divergent followers or not, this movie fails for the length of time and plot it delivers to be enjoyable.

As stated before, I don't believe in rating movies terribly low, so I give this movie series a generous 6 without going into more details.",1475193600,,1098,4.336585365853659

Her brother/real-life-boyfriend received a much more prominent role,which took away from the story.  It created an odd rhythm.  The beginning of the movie was very slow.  I did not see the connection anymore between 4 and Shailene.  That being said after 15 minutes the story became interesting.  there was good technological ideas.  This is a series that could have gone so much further.

7686623,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"I am just going to say it - I enjoyed this film. Yes, it tanked in theatres, and didn't come off nearly as strong as the first two, I still found interesting plots/ideas/cgi. First off, I love when they 'dystopia' and everyone is pretty, showered, hair done, the perfect smear of dirt to represent the deplorable conditions they exist in. (meet my parents and you will know first-hand, the true rulers of the coming Dystopian Era). And how come everyone's clothes FIT and were perfect? But hey, suspension of disbelief, right?

Story, story, angst, story, action, whining, death, death mob, the pretty leads escape, the attractive bad antagonists follow... OMG 2 amazingly beautiful hidden cities... more angst and whining and guns. .. etc. Basically in a nutshell.

Yes, the two hidden-outside-the-wall cites were, to me, incredibly beautiful, in design and look. That flat near the top floor - mine, I planted a flag. However, with everything beautiful, there is always a deceptive undercurrent. Jeff Daniels (love) has that sweet-evil quality, though it barely reads on screen, sadly. Bunch of uptight worker bees bustling around some amazing Big Brother esque technology. Meh, cool. Seen it before, and better.

Naomi Watt (love) definitely not her strongest role. Stereotypical to say the least. Octavia Spencer (love) (whom most this film is geared towards will know her from The Help) is sublime. To me, she can do no wrong.

HERE, is where I found it interesting... although, poorly written for delivery. Tris passively challenges the main overlords. The line - 'human beings cannot be categorised' I found interesting. The TINY speech around it though, hitting on some very interesting ideas, was gone before you noticed and riddled with whiny angst. But the idea of factions, segregation, categories, exclusion, 'pure and damaged'... are incredible topics for a film geared to the generation beneath me (whose minds are opening twice as fast as my generation). Sadly, it was glossed over... until the final speech in the film by Tris. I am a composer/artist and as much as I like to wow people with pretty cgi, I also desire to have them leave considering things, ideas, perspectives. This collection of films nailed it in the first one, but failed in this one.

Apparently, there is a 4th one, whose budget was just cut in half. ugh. Talk about dystopian futures.",1473033600,9,2374,5.030534351145038

I do feel like this movie sets it up for the final installment, but just like the book I'm not to interested or invested in the antagonist of this part of the series. It felt as if the writer was just trying to continue the series. I will still watch the next film, but I won't have too high of expectations for it.

7686702,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"It should have been titled ""Divergent"", as it diverged almost completely from the book.

I was introduced to the series by watching the first movie, Divergent, which I liked well enough to read the entire series of books.  Frankly, I thought the book series was pretty good, but not really great, and so I wanted to see the movies, too.

The first movie was the best for me, and it followed the book fairly closely.  The 2nd movie, Insurgent, was not as good and it began to deviate from the book pretty quickly.  This movie, Allegiant, didn't follow the book at all.  With the exception of using characters from the book, it ran off on its own course and little was recognizable from the book.  What could have been a good story was ""Hollywoodized"" into a formulaic action flick with one dimensional characters and little surprise.  Quite a disappointment.  For those of you who have read the book and like it, I would rate this movie with one star for its lack of adherence to the book and the lost opportunities caused by that.

In all fairness to the movie though, when viewed as a completely separate story, it was reasonably enjoyable and the action moved along nicely.  As I said before, there were no surprises, the plot was formulaic and the characters shallow.  So, all in all, I'm comfortable giving it three stars over all.

Some of the other reviewers indicated that there will be a fourth movie.  I don't doubt it, as the ending surely left big enough hooks to give the idea that the producers consider that there is still some money to be made with this franchise; although, as others have said, if they had stuck more closely to the book, they could have ended it all with this movie.  If there's a fourth movie, I think I'll wait until it comes to cable to watch it, as it will very likely have little to do with the books' story and the story line they've taken in the movies doesn't grab me enough to make me want to pay money to see it.

So, in conclusion, those who have read the books will likely be disappointed with the Allegiant movie, but those who have seen the first two movies will probably like this one just fine.  Neither group will find this movie to be outstanding.",1472342400,,2199,4.471177944862156

7686718,4,B01CP0Q8S0,"OK, this is a tough one.  Let me start by mentioning that I'm more years than I'd care to mention beyond being a teenager, and this entire series seems VERY much aimed at teenagers.

Nonetheless, it's fun and entertaining.  Neither deep nor groundbreaking, but just SciFi that grabs your attention and entertains.  You kind of have to ignore the teen aesthetic here and just let it be what it is.  Then, despite it's slant toward the kids, it's better than just decent entertainment.",1472169600,,483,4.771084337349397

7686749,4,B01CP0Q8S0,"Because I had already watched the beginning of the series, I had to watch The Divergent Series: Allegiant.  I find it impossible to watch one movie and not the sequels, no matter what the quality of the original movie is.  I just can't help it.

I haven't read the books so I don't have anything to compare this movie to.  All I can compare it to are other movies like it and the previous ones in the series.  That being said, I guess I would say that I liked the movie.  They were all relatively interesting.  I feel like I had figured out this particular one earlier into the viewing than the others.  It seemed to be lacking a little something, but I am not quite sure what.
The acting was about the same as the other films.  Nothing spectacular, yet not terrible.
I watch a lot of movies, and I have to say that I am not a very harsh critic.  I enjoy movies for what they are.  I like escaping reality for a couple hours and enjoy the alternate reality that a movie presents.
Overall, I enjoyed the movie.  It wasn't my favorite of this series, but it was still an enjoyable to watch.  It is visually appealing and an interesting enough story line.  I would have liked to know a little more about the main city, but I suppose it wasn't entirely necessary in this part of the story.  I am curious to read the books now though.  I wonder what more information I could glean from the written aspect.",1471910400,,1400,4.266159695817491

7686759,2,B01CP0Q8S0,"The first in the series was quite good, the second mediocre but watchable, and the third (Allegiant) was poor (waste of money). The film starts slowly while the director tries to explain what has gone before and while we are where we are; and fails. There are brief moments of action and then the story looses its way. Many scenes have not been thought out and make no sense. One moment, the Director is all powerful and all seeing with amazing technological resources and next moment he is helpless and blind. The good guys who have very little exposure to any sort of modern technology, can in a few seconds become experts at operating complex high tech devices ( better than those trained on the equipment). The director (& his troops) controls a force field wall and then he his forces can't pass while the good guys escape.

Evelyn has taken over as the leader. Four is able to free Caleb and save him from punishment out of respect for Tris. Tris and Four and a few others are able to escape over the wall. Tori is shot down by Edgar while attempting to escape. The rest of the group make it over the wall safely and are rescued by the bureau. Meanwhile, Chicago is at war. David, the leader of the bureau, thanks Tris for opening the Box since she is the only ""Pure"" Divergent. David was attempting a plan to cure all of the ""Damaged"" people for centuries and had only succeeded at creating 1 ""Pure"" human being, Tris, in all of history. Over time, Tris starts to really trust David. Four decides to go visit The Fringe where he uncovers David's real hidden agenda. David keeps Tris and Four separated on purpose as a result because Four warns Tris that David can't be trusted. Tris doesn't listen to Four regarding that, at first. Later on, Tris is able to understand the reason David shouldn't be trusted. David is secretly trying to help Evelyn destroy Chicago's citizens by contaminating them with tear gas that can wipe the memories of anyone who comes into contact with it. Evelyn starts to release the tear gas but Tris is able to stop it's release at the last minute, thereby, saving the entire city. The film ends with Tris and Four giving each other a big hug without realizing that David is also watching from the background. Very entertaining Movie. Get this movie and see for yourself.

7686838,2,B01CP0Q8S0,"This was one of those films, where you say the line, ""the series had been really good but they made one film too many"".  The plot predictable, stupid and nothing we haven't seen in countless other films before.  The film also lacks action, the most exciting part is when they flee Chicago early on in the film.  We've got a lot of obvious filmed against a green screen stuff going on such as floating elevators and floating see through cars.  The first movie created a great young female character who used her intelligence to outwit opponents as well a toughness and determination, yet for this movie she's just standing in a glass room, sitting in the passenger seat of a glass floating car.  Then we have the character Four, who can fight ten highly trained guys at once, yeah right!  The main characters are told they've been being observed their whole lives with hidden cameras yet none bring up the obvious ""what, you watched me while in the bathroom, while we had sex,"" and other stuff you'd likely be just a tad angry about?  This movie also made the events of the first two movies kind or pointless and redundant.",1471132800,5,1122,4.58

7686982,1,B01CP0Q8S0,"Just finished watching ""Allegiant"" released by Summit Entertainment.
It would be an understatement to say that this third entry in ""The Divergent Series"" is a very poor entry in this movie series based on the third and final novel in the series.
Picking up just a few days after the events in ""Insurgent"" where it was revealed that the City of Chicago was part of a genetic experiment designed to create the perfect human being - which is Tris - Chicago is under lock down and martial law because Four's mother; who just happens to be in charge of the city now, is very much afraid the puppet masters who were pulling the strings behind the curtain.  So she allows public show trails and executions as a diversion to prevent people from thinking too much about going over the wall and exploring the vast unknown world beyond them.
Naturally Tris, Four, and their fellow rebels want to go over the wall and see what is beyond.
Tris, Four, and company escape over, but not without causalities.  Soon they are rescued by the very puppet masters who set up the Chicago Experiment over two hundred years ago after a global nuclear war.  The goal of the Chicago Experiment, and others like it, Tris soon learns is to prevent another global nuclear war by creating a genetically pure human beings that are incapable of pushing nuclear triggers.
A lot of the performances have the feel of being phone in.
Now as to whether or not ""Allegiant 2"" should be made. It may be a good idea to let this movie series end with this movie.
Not Recommended.

7686987,1,B01CP0Q8S0,"I read the book and really liked it.  Then I watched the movie and hated it.  It was like someone stole the writer's idea and then wrote their own totally different movie.  Spoiler alert:  In the book, Tris was the one who Four admitted was always right and that, if he had listened to her, it would have saved a lot of lives.  She's a strong and dominant character.  So what's this nonsense that in the movie he's right and she, like a weak little girl, leans into his shoulder and says she's sorry?  I don't usually recognize sexism, but this is pretty blatant.

If all you want a fast-paced action movie where everything turns out happy with an all's-right-with-the-world mentality, then watch the movie.  If you want a really good story of love, hope, friendship, forgiveness, loyalty, and sacrifice, read the book and forget the movie.",1470441600,,840,4.659863945578231

I had a couple problems with the story not so much the production which was very good. I just had a couple problems with the story because some things were ridiculous. Tris wished so much to be this special being that she would not listen to anything that four had to say. Guess what, he was right. I had a very hard time thru all 3 of these movies buying her as this very heroic figure. if it wasn't for four I hate to think what would have happened. The support cast and now with jeff Daniels are terrific. four's Mom is another power mad nut. I would have had to shoot her at some point. Myles Teller, cracks me up and all along you just never know about him. Ansel Elgort is excellent and so is Theo james. Shailene is also very good too, she has grown into this role.

Unfortunately shooting water guns at the television to try to speed up the action didn't work.  I lost the television picture, but I stuck with the remaining 90+ minutes in audio and was pleasantly surprised when the movie ended and I could move on with my life.  I give it two stars rather than one because I just can't do that to Naomi Watts- she works hard.  This cast delivered their lines as if a cue card intern was directly off stage feeding the actors on 2 word cards.  The book also was a convoluted mess of a plot, flawlessly etched into this cinematic gem (the gem being a broken opal).

7687189,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"I really have liked the Divergent series up until this movie.  I think they kind of lost it a bit and it wasn't near as entertaining or interesting as the previous two were.  It felt like this was almost a placeholder in the story line for the next movie.  Now, since this movie didn't do near as well as the previous ones, let's hope there is another movie so they can redeem this one and bring this movie series to a great conclusion.

Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't terrible but I don't think it was a developed and... involved?... as the previous movies.  Of course (SPOILER ALERT) one of my favorite minor characters Tori - Maggie Q's - was killed for NO REASON... Sniff Sniff, but that happens in movies, darn it!!

Maybe because they were bringing in a lot of new characters to the story and to advance the story line this is what needed to be done but it's missing something and I honestly can't put my finger on it for some reason and it's driving me nuts.",1469491200,10,971,4.3076923076923075

7687331,5,B01CP0Q8S0,"The third film in the Divergent film series, based on the books by Veronica Roth. The Divergent Series: Allegiant continues the story that began in Divergent and Insurgent. Following Jeanine's defeat at the end of Insurgent, the people of Chicago were ready to head out into the world beyond the wall after discovering a message from the Founders, but Evelyn (Naomi Watts) has other ideas and once again seals the wall and attempts to take over by force becoming yet another dictator. This causes a divide inside Chicago as the forces loyal to Evelyn begin a series of mock trials executing many of the people of Abnegation while those opposed follow the people of Amity led by Octavia Spencer.

Our main characters Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) rescue Tris's brother from the mock trials and head over the wall along with several others and soon discover the Bureau (ledy by Jeff Daniels) who hope to use Tris in finding a way of curing the imperfect (most of the people of Chicago) but in their pursuit of a cure they have neglected Chicago allowing it to run amok.

The film continues the great story and action seen in the first two Divergent films and the same great cast returns (Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Zoe Kravitz, Maggie Q, Naomi Watts, Ray Stevenson, Octavia Spencer and Daniel Dae Kim) along with newcomers (Jeff Daniels, Xander Berkeley, Bill Skarsgard).

The film ends with a cliffhanger which is to be concluded in a 4th film which may end up being a special TV movie if Lionsgate gets their way rather than releasing the final film in theaters as originally planned. This film was much better than people have given it credit for and it was the poor turn out in theaters for this third installment that is resulting in Lionsgate changing their intitial plans. Give this one a chance on home video and show Lionsgate that we do want to see the final installment.

Great special effects and post-apocalyptic environments are on view in this installment. A great third film for the franchise.",1469232000,,2054,4.793785310734464

Picture Quality:
Outstanding color draws you in from the opening scene. The  use of HDR is apparent and really brought out the deepest colors ever seen on my tv! 100% grain free and looks spectacular guys!

Story:
Building on the strong ending, the story picks up right where it left off..kinda. it omitts the part where all the people were running to the wall, and just starts with the main 4 characters on the wall. This flaw aside, the rest on the story is told with strong suspense and had my wife and I on the edge of our seats! Not to spoil any big moments but lets just say the ending was perfect! If you liked the last two you'll be glad to hear this is the best one yet! Im very pleased with my purchase. This is a must have with a very strong suspense story here! The reviews claiming actors looked bored and this film was lazy had me worried,  but they were clearly internet trolls as this movie rocked! I did not see this movie coming out this strong! Great story!

PG- 13 lies:
There is female rear and frontal nudity so if you have kids or value your marriage above average standards, skip or fast foward(without them looking of course) the contamination cleaning scene.  After that scene you're good for the entire movie.

Summary:
Overall, this movie comes highly recommended and awarded for just a fantastic experience! Absolutely buy it if you love the last movies, and even if you didn't this is great!

Note:
This is a movie, so if you read the book DO NOT compare the two stories, you will only upset yourself and ruin a fantastic experience. Just watch this as it is. Simply put this is great. ",1469145600,,1634,4.42

7687453,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"I don't want this review to come across as too negative-I did find the film entertaining, but this movie does deserve to take it on the chin a little-it earned that right fair and square.  A little background info first-I read the Divergent book series before the movies came along and found them entertaining but not mind blowing by any means.  I thought the first film was pretty good and true to the source material.  The second ""diverged"" (pun intended) from the 2nd book pretty drastically but was still a pretty decent film in its own right.  Now along comes the third film and the cracks are really beginning to show in this series.

  Because I like these characters I think I was able to forgive a lot of the films flaws.  But trust me, there are a LOT of flaws and they deserve to be called out.  First off, this book bares little to no resemblance to the source material outside of the setting(s) and a few key characters.  That being said, what is here from the book pretty much covers the entirety of book 3 which makes me wonder why a 4th film in this series is really necessary.  Where do they go from here exactly?  15 minutes more of this film would have easily covered the rest of the Allegiant book and ended the series.  Second, the plot here is paper thin, yet overly complicated at the same time and the reliance on unnecessary over-the-top special effects to tell the story instead of character interactions is the film's biggest sin.

  And now we come to it.  The biggest problem with this film is the special effects and that's why my review is titled as it is.  Wow and I do mean wow.  The special effects here are really, really bad.  This film would've looked amateurish even by early nineties standards.  The special effects are just horribly-easily the most fakey looking effects I've seen outside of original Syfy movies.  I think the effects here are only just marginally better than any given Sharknado film.  For a series as popular and mainstream as this one is-it's downright embarrassing.  And you want to know the worst part?  I would have rather had this movie scrap about half of the special effects shots and put more emphasis character development.  It also would've trimmed the budget down significantly something I heard that the fourth movie is being forced to do with this one underperforming as it did.  It all seemed so unnecessary as if the film makers were trying to wow us with this super science fictiony approach to Veronica Roth's world but forgot that characters and story telling are what make a movie good, not fakey looking (and completely unnecessary) drone discs and horribly composited space ships.  Oh the poor characters.

  The second biggest problem with this film are the characters.  No-it's not their fault, Shailene Woodley and Theo James do the best they can with what they're given, but there really isn't much for them to do-they are so underutilized so the film can just show you more piss poor unnecessary special effect scenes.  Are you a Christina fan?  If so, just know that she gets totally sidelined again just like in the last film.  Uriah fan?  He has a grand total of about 45 seconds of screen time.  So much for them injecting one of the best characters from the book series into the movies at all.  No one who hadn't read the books would even know who he is.  That's a shame.  Uriah was a great character.

  Like I said earlier, I still found this film entertaining and I'm able to overlook some of the flaws because I like these characters, but man this film feels amateurish.  One can only hope that with the fourth film needing to be almost completely new material that they can give these characters a proper send off.  It's a shame that this one lacks the effort and polish that the first two films had.  It really is a sloppily made movie all around.",1468800000,49,3843,4.577092511013216

7687468,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"Following in the footsteps of movie series like Hunger Games, this third installment of the Divergent sequel has been broken up into two separate movie parts with the second part of the Allegiant movie due out next year.  I am not familiar with the books of the series but I have enjoyed the previous movies of the series.  Like the two-part Hunger Games movie finale, I really think that part one of two of the final Divergent movie feels like they stretched out the story in order to make this into two movies instead of one.  There are lots of stretches in the movie that are slow moving and I really think the two parts could have been combined to make a really good finale as opposed to a part one that feels a bit lackluster in my opinion.  There are some slow scenes and there is a lack of action.  I understand that they are doing the build-up to the final movie but the build-up takes a long time to develop.  The cast are comfortable in their roles but there is little in the way of any further character development.  The special effects are well done for the most part as with the other movies in the series.  The story in Allegiant feels like it is almost a repeat of the opening Divergent movie.  Escape, find another place outside the wall that has a similar short sighted bad guy as the place they left and then work to defeat the bad guys.  Even with what I consider the flaws in the movie with it being slow moving and stretched out story, I did enjoy watching the movie, but I do feel it is a bit of a letdown as compared to the first two Divergent movies.  I just hope the final installment of the series really brings this part one and the series to a satisfying conclusion.

7687470,1,B01CP0Q8S0,"I don't know how people can rate this movie so highly.  It's rare that i go out of my way to rate anything, especially from the discomfort of a smartphone.  However, i will make an exception this time.  I came into the divergent series blind, with no prior knowledge and was pleasantly surprised.  The first two movies turned out great.  I was eager to find out what happened next.  What came next was a huge disappointment.  Upon release to blu ray, i was quick to purchase and watch(best buy if yer wondering).  Im glad i didn't make it to the theater for this one and i wish i waited for the bargain bin.  What plagues this movie is its consequence-free blandness and its predictability.  You can predict every action a good 5 to 30 seconds before its about to happen.  I didn't feel the least bit excited.  I like that feeling of wondering what will happen next.  This time around, i had to go without.  As far as checking it out for continuity purposes..  i get it..  but its like a movie u see once just to get it over  with vs a movie that hooks u while you're changing the channel.. making u stop to watch it over again..  its rather forgettable..  and this is only part 1?  Good god.  I guess a hero is only as good and the villain they're fighting.  One incredible villain was replaced by a mediocre one... and the feeling is lackluster.  Go in with a bunch of friends, if u want, at a couple bux a piece and at least u can all group facepalm at the end of the movie and rock paper scissors to see who gets to put the disc in the microwave.

Two: splitting the third book of the series, a book which barely made sense as a whole, into two movies was a fatal mistake. There was very too much dead space in the movie where almost nothing happened. Peter was meant to be comic relief but even he was tedious and obnoxious. Three: what the heck was going on with the special effects? The lighting was blown out and then filters added in on top making the green screen painfully obvious and completely distracting. With all of the recent superhero, dystopian, and scifi films there are plenty of examples of how to at lest attempt to make a totally green screen movie without it looking like a bunch of first grades were experimenting with Microsoft Paint. Parts of the movie were so unintentionally funny that I had to laugh out loud.

None of this even makes sense.""

I totally hate it...and not just because of the end.  I hated it long before that.  1. In the Allegiant book, Four was made less intelligent than he was in the two previous books.  Thankfully, the movie gave him all his IQ points back  *happy dance*.  2. That whole POV switch every chapter gave me a migraine...I couldn't even tell who the heck was talking, and at some point I no longer cared.  In the movie, the storyline was coherent and interesting...and had enough elements from the book to satisfy me.  I'm not a purist when it comes to Book-Movie adaptation.  I understand that some things get lost in translation, and not because the film-makers are lazy, cheap, or disrespectful to the source material...but there are time constraints, budgets issues, feasibility problems.  Honestly, some things just don't translate well. CGI can't do it all, and even if it could, does anyone really want to watch a totally blue screen movie?  I don't.  Likewise, 1st person books translated to film have a special handicap...the narrator character's thoughts???  Voice-overs are ok for a minute or two, but not for the whole movie.  So most of the thoughts are lost, no biggie if you ask me.  This is a rare instance where I liked the movie better than the book.",1468368000,,1420,4.661290322580645

7687609,1,B01CP0Q8S0,"Don't bother watching this movie if you've read the book (assuming you liked it). It deviates so far from it that the story is completely unrecognizable. There is hardly anything in this move that relates to the story in the book. The actors look bored, the script is crap, and the special effects are waaaay too over the top. And to think that there's still one more to go! I can see why they split HP into two, but for Twilight, HG, and Divergent it's just unnecessary. I'm glad I work at a video store and didn't have to pay to watch this drivel. I liked the first movie. The second was a little lame. But this one is just trash.

And just one random thought: When, exactly, did Tris learn to walk in heels? Not in Abnegation and not in Dauntless!",1468368000,2,750,4.28169014084507
7687610,1,B01CP0Q8S0,"Allegiant was IMO the worst of the three books; the movie followed suit and then some.  It's the worst of the three movies in the series, worse than the book it is based on, and one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  Using technical flash to cover a lack of plot or character development is a pet peeve of mine, and that's all this movie is.  They would have done better to stick closer to the book.",1468368000,2,411,4.049382716049383

True, they are VERY different from each other, and most book lovers are the ones who put down the movies for not being as great as the book. However, I love both! Shailene Woodey is the perfect Tris, and I definitely wouldn't have pictured Miles Teller as Peter but he's the best 'insert choice word here' that you have to love.",1468368000,,371,4.391304347826087

7687613,4,B01CP0Q8S0,"I watched this again last night and was pleased with the movie.  Thank God I am not one of those people that goes to a movie hoping it will be just like the book and then disappointed. I noticed that there was no Veronica Roth in the extra features and was wondering what her take is on the movie.
My daughter thought the movie series was done, but I had to prove to her that there is another movie in the works.  I'm getting tired of getting two movies where there was only one book.  I was with my daughter on this one though. If I didn't see another movie, it ended well enough to end the series.
I will probably not go see the last movie in the theater and just order the blu-ray so as to complete the series; although, I did enjoy this movie. The acting was first rate.  Jeff Daniels as a David was wonderful. He was a benevolent character that you will love to hate.  Naomi Watts is wonderful as someone that you don't like just because of her abandonment of her child to a monster.  Theo James is getting more liquid and less stiff (I could truly see him as a bond character), and Shailene Woodley is improving also; however, I think she is a wonderful actress as is proven in ""The fault in our Stars"".
I don't think I'll ever be able to watch another movie that Miles Teller is in and not dislike him just because he is so good at his character in these movies.  He is a character that you just don't like from beginning to end. While Ansel Elgort is fabulous as a brother Tris can't trust and doesn't like.  She loves him on principle, but doesn't really like him.  Amazing Dichotomy.
This is another Urban apocalypse series, but I like it. It is another in a line of movies that are a guilty pleasure to watch.",1468368000,,1720,4.219512195121951
7687614,2,B01CP0Q8S0,"As far as the movies go this was definitely worse than Divergent and Insurgent. And compared to the books this whole movie series is trash. However, the real mess up was splitting the final book into 2 films much like the Hunger Games did as well as Harry Potter. Now this is still an incredible series overall. But the movie seems to be full of filler that was forced in the split the book into 2. Even after the fact that they completely removed one of the secondary characters from the entire story.

I only suggest people watch this that haven't read the books and review wise I'd give it a 4/10. But am still highly looking forward to the final movie, it can't be worse than this was. It is important to note that this series as a whole was so fresh and inspiring from a story telling perspective that it is easily my favorite series that has come out in the past 5 years or so.",1468368000,,883,4.255952380952381

The rest of this felt like I was watching actors trying to act, and a movie trying to be deeper than it had the chops for.  Pretty disappointing end to a semi-decent franchise.

In my opinion, Veronica Roth is a pretty good writer, with a mediocre idea.  The films didn't even do that justice, however.  Waste of money.  Waste of time.",1468281600,,451,4.36144578313253

The third installment of the Divergent series sees our hero, Tris, escape with Four beyond the wall that encircles Chicago, to finally discover the shocking truth of the world around them. God, Im bored just writing that.

What did I think?

The first book/film was flawed but had enough interesting ideas to keep you engaged and wondering. Sadly, by the third in this series, its just incredibly tired and old. Theres nothing new or shocking in this predictable and two-dimensional story. There are quite a number of good action scenes but with a paper-thin plot not really holding it together?

I really liked the actors playing Tris and Four but even their acting could barely save this. I might have enjoyed it more if I didn't read the series. I like the movie Beautiful Creatures by itself but as a adaptation from a book, it was terrible.

two-part affair)
After the death of 'Jeanine' 'Evelyn' (Naomi Watts) has taken charge behind the walls of Chicago, little has changed, the
divide and rule continues.
'Tris' (Shailee Woodley) and 'Four' (Theo James) who want no part of 'Evelyn's' regime decide to make a bid to escape the
confines of the wall hoping to find a better future, they take 'Tris's' brother 'Caleb' (Ansel Elgort) 'Christina' (Zoe Kravitz)
'Tori' (Maggie Q) and reluctantly 'Peter' (Miles Teller) who had failed them before and surely will again.
The attempt to scale the wall and escape is fraught with danger as 'Evelyn's' soldiers try to prevent them doing so....
Beyond the wall they will find much desolation that were the aftermath of the holocaust of 200 years earlier, the four
remaining escapee's are rescued from their pursuers by a group they learn are from The Bureau of Genetic Welfare where
they are taken to.
The group investigate damaged-genes they'd created as they tried to modify to create a better society, and seek a way of
repairing the damage...
When investigating their four guests it is found that 'Tris's genes are truly divergent, the others prove to carry damaged,
the director of the centre 'David' (Jeff Daniels) wants to investigate and carry out tests to determine what had given her
the perfect genes....'Tris' accepts the approach.
'Four' becomes trained-up as part of the centre's military force...when on a mission he becomes very suspicious of the groups
intent, and seeks to share his thoughts with 'Tris' who in truth appears to be committed to 'David's' investigation.
However they will learn that 'David' though answerable to higher authorities at another centre, has down the years orchestrated
much of what takes place behind the walls of Chicago, and that civil-war between 'Evelyn's' Factionless and 'Joanna's (Octavia
Spencer) Allegiants was brewing, a fact that 'Celeb' had identified.
'Four' has to persuade 'Tris' to join him and return to Chicago to try and prevent the war......
Whatever the outcome you can be sure 'David' is not finished with his intent to continue his investigation concerning 'Tris'
All set up nicely for the final-part 'Ascendant' in 2017.
There are several decent action sequences along the way along with a great array of impressive special-effects.....
Another very watchable series

Four JOURNEYING Stars. In ""Allegiant"", the ""Divergent"" series, the storyline eventually expands beyond the wall. But the story initially picks up after the shocking assassination at the end of the second episode ""Insurgent"" and the invitation by a woman in a hologram message for citizens of Chicago to go beyond the wall surrounding the city. Evelyn has taken over, prevented access to the wall, and begins doling out justice. Tris, Four, and others decide to cross the wall and run, uncovering even bigger challenges and dangers ""out there"". This is not a stand-alone episode, nor are the other two, because much has transpired with regard to Janine and the Factions in the two preceding movies.

The second in the series (insurgent) was okay, but seemed very basic.  Although nothing will top the original Divergent movie, I thought that Allegiant was much better than the Insurgent.  I felt the second Insurgent was designed more of a storyline to set up for this and the final chapter.  I know it did not fare neary as well this time around with audiences, most likely because Insurgent lacked in several areas and lost some followers of the series in doing so.  My family, who normally see things on the big screen, waited to see Allegiant on Amazon because of the diminished excitement following the second film.

7687754,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"Insurgent left a bad taste in my mouth, but I wanted to see this trilogy through. Wait, it's not a trilogy? Indeed, they've pulled the Hunger Games trick on us, turning a trilogy into a tetralogy (look for ""Ascendant"" in 2017). Why not just stretch Divergent out into 13 movies? Let's see, assuming the present rate of one picture per year, that would make Shailene Woodley 33 years old for the 2026 installment where she finally defeats The Man or The Man Behind the Curtain (let's just call him David) or whomever they are fighting against.

A big dumb Hollywood flick consisting of mostly harebrained dialogue and countless unlikely scenarios, I am nonetheless rating this sucker at better than 2 stars due to:
- Loads of sci-fi gadgetry.
- Characters who can be forgiven for having a 4th grade vocabulary since many of the actors are just so gall danged easy on the eyes.
- A gooey, heartwarming sentiment of rebelling against divisiveness (not uncalled-for in our time of vicious divisiveness).
- Allegiant being perhaps vaguely prescient in a manner similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gattaca/dp/B000I8G5B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gattaca</a>.
- Shailene Woodley being a sterling actor, one who will eventually win more than just MTV Movie Awards.

Random thoughts re Allegiant:
- Naomi Watts, who plays Four's mom Evelyn, is 47 years old, and Theo James (as Tobias ""Four"" Eaton) is 31; this means Evelyn gave birth to Four when she was 16 years old (I doubt the book tells you that!!)
- Thankfully Peter was still around because he provides needed comic relief, as lame as it is (sure, he would get kicked out of open mic night in 2016, but beggars can't be choosers far in the future when humanity has apparently lost its sense of humor).
- Apparently if you are deemed ""genetically pure"" in the future, you get the privilege of wearing high heels (like Tris does) when going to meet with the New World Order bigwigs.
- Woodley's character is told, ""Please remove your clothes and place them in the incineration hatch."" Don't get your hopes up, this is rated PG-13.
- If you hear someone say, ""Welcome to the future, we've been waiting for you,"" get worried.

So who will like Allegiant? Liberals can get behind Allegiant because the movie's heroes aren't jerks, and folks who hate liberals should love Allegiant because there's a ratio of 5 high-tech assault rifles per each character in the flick (not to mention handguns and an assorted array of lethal devices handed out to anyone who wants them). Since everybody knows that liberals and people who hate liberals together make up 100% of the American citizenry, this means 100% of the population should like Allegiant!!",1466812800,51,2735,5.033112582781457

I'm not looking forward to the last movie due to how poorly this movie was written. (Though I haven't read the books, I would assume it is a problem with the screenwriters, studio and directors. Nobody in their right mind would want to put their name on or in a film like this; I feel bad for the actors.)

Scene:
""I think I hear an engine, someone is following us."" Cue car flying over ditch with angry looking antagonist glaring at protagonists on foot, and then a chase scene through a barren waste land where it rains red... but not in Chicago. (Like someone hobbled together Mad Max and Oblivion; but even after assembly via directions, a lot of lego bricks left over and something doesn't look right. Bad Script. Bad Direction. Bad Assembly.)

7687772,2,B01CP0Q8S0,"I feel insulted by the Divergent movies. Why? Ill tell you. When I was in high school, I desperately wanted to gain more friends and feel like I belong. It was unfortunate that I had to come across these feelings just as Facebook had taken over. This is where Harry Potter comes into play. I saw myself as Harry, rejected, in need of loved ones, and eventually finding a place where he is valued for who he is. So it was convenient timing that the franchise was at its peak in my teen years, the last of the movies premiering the same summer I graduated high school. But does this Divergent book series live up to reflecting those years the right way? I guess so. Does the movie series live up to my expectations? No way.

I get it, Tris is a hard worker who is trying to figure out where she belongs. Ive been there before along with every other teen. I guess Divergent stands out from other young adult novels by how it criticizes humanity and exposure therapy. Then again, these details ought to actually have some serious attention paid to them while bringing the books onto the screen. The most boring of all of them being Allegiant.

As far as the continuation of the series goes, its essentially Tris leading her friends out of Chicago, over the wall separating them from the outside, and meeting with the Bureau of Genetic Warfare, the outside organization that found ways to control human genetics. They have also found ways to control the people camping outside their city by kidnapping and erasing the memories of the children. This reality is not bad, I just don't care about this world in the same way I did about Hogwarts.

This movie wouldnt have sucked if you enjoy listening to painfully obvious messages like, is it better to kill a healthy child or a sick old man? Or, people are sheep. They need a shepherd, lest they be slaughtered. Or, Leaders make tough decisions to protect their people. Now look, they're all well-meaning philosophical statements, but hasn't The Hunger Games already done all this slightly better?

Not to mention theres so much lazy exposition through computers and characters saying their exact feelings in the most obvious way. Seriously, this series is 4% emotion and 96% exposition.

Thats really one of the only pluses of this teen franchise wannabee. The most excruciating part of this movie series, especially this one, is the acting. Although all the actors still look the part, their performances will stab you in the ears and eyes because of their absolute disinterest. All they do is put on one clueless facial expression, leading actress Shailene Woodley having the worst case of it. Her pale face turns intentionally spectacular moments into absolutely hollow wastes of screen time, she won't even rattle after hearing her life is on the line. Then there is of course more of her mega awkward romance with Theo James, two who you can tell she doesnt really like in real life. She barely even looks him in the eye.

The pain doesnt stop there though. The Whiplash star Miles Teller gives the most inexcusably annoying performance in the series. I cant put my finger on as to why, but every time the kid opens his mouth, I just want to strangle his neck and yell in his face, SHUT UP!

At least the new villain played by Jeff Daniels acts different from the rest, as he miraculously overplays the part, yet at the same time underplays it.

These dreadful performances make me seriously plead, why Lionsgate, why? Why get Robert Schwentke to direct? He showed no appreciation to what he was doing with the storys message of union within people. He rather follows the directing advice of George Lucas by telling his actors, faster and more intense. Except he took faster as in lets get this take done faster and more intense as in we should more intensely get our scenes filmed today so we can premiere this movie in six months as scheduled!

So, whats going to happen next? I don't think theres any reason to worry, as reading the books would prove more valuable than seeing these half-baked movies. The books bring some meaningful messages about how our thoughts and feelings create more safety than if we were without them, and how we ought to be unified in our diversities, not segregated by categories. So say no to cliques. We are one as a nation. While Harry Potter did add to my life as a teen by making me feel like I belong in a society of segregation, the Divergent book series also do a satisfactory job at teaching our current youth to ignore the governments declarations on segregation. Yet the movies, Allegiant in particular, insults Veronica Roths thoughts on America. So I won't be watching this ever again, and neither will you.

This is not a review of movie content, plots, twists and spoilers. This can be viewed as an open letter to studios as a lament of the marketing decision to shelve the 3D format. I have seen 4K content, and additionally, I own a fabulous SUHD 65 and a great upscaling blu ray, 3d player. No doubt there some great reasons to support 4K, although there are many tepid reviews of native 4K content. I will say, for my enjoyment, there is no equal to a good 3D experience, the depth of field, the sheer feeling of participation, the sense of presence that cannot be rivaled in a 2D format. There are many movies out there that clearly advertise 3D IMAX in theaters, but no longer appear as a home video option. Additionally I have no intention of upgrading, yet again, my library as I have done since the early days of home theater. 4K is an alternate choice, not an upgrade and lacks the immersive experience of 3D. Now, as you all must know, 2016 HD TVs no longer even offer 3D. What the.???
Not all movies, not even a close majority can be available as 3D. I get it. But I have laid out a tide little sum of high definition equipment and upscaling capabilities and I feel a bit betrayed but this decision clearly motivated by money ( isn't it always) with pretty much no regard to the consumer, who has funded your companys all these years, and this is the thanks we fans can now expect. My contribution goes back many years and many dollars. (who remembers laser disc special editions going for $100? Thats right, $100.!! Fox led that charge, Alien, Aliens. How about the Rocky Horror VHS price years ago. Thank you Fox! But looking forward, I do not advocate the demise or removal of 4K and know it is here to stay, thats fine, but please reconsider this decision 2D will always be 2d, no matter what. I personally would rather feel transported into a 3D realm of presence, and would sacrifice the option of seeing more pores on someones face or more fibers on a suit or how much shinier Iron Mans paint can be in a 2D world. My fellow consumers, please show your support and chime to studios and distributors as I have done to keep this format alive. Dont think your opinion has no value! UNITE!

7687781,4,B01CP0Q8S0,"""Allegiant"" tells the story of a young woman named Tris and her lover named Four who break away from a social-class of militants who have taken control of Chicago.  As the leader of the militants holds trials and executions of her opposition, Tris realizes that her younger brother has been deemed to be part of the opposition to the militant leader, and this causes Tris to go rescue her sibling and then escape from Chicago with her brother, lover, and friends.  As Tris and her band of refugees flee for new and unexplored lands that have recently been made available for them to access, the militant-class pursues them.

 ""Allegiant"" is the third film from the Divergent film series, and it is a good film for several reasons. Namely, this film is NOT a remake, nor is it a part-remake and part-sequel as a lot of films have been.  ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a remake of the original ""Star Wars"" but it is disguised as a sequel.  So was ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" since it is a remake of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"".  ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is clearly a remake of the original ""Independence Day"" film.  ""Ghostbusters (2016)"" is obviously a remake of ""Ghostbusters (1984)"".
The plethora of Disney films that were remade and are being remade is shameless; ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the best animated film due to its artwork, music, story with a villain looking good and the good man looking bad, and Belle actually being the hero because she gives the Beast the strength to fight and break his curse, therefore ""Beauty and the Beast"" should have been left alone.
 ""Return to Oz"" is also very good and dark because it is a faithful adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz books written by L. Frank Baum which are dark. Attempts to remake ""Return to Oz"" should end and instead pursuits of a sequel should be made that adapt the books ""Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz"", ""The Road to Oz"", and ""The Emerald City of Oz""
---this can be done as demonstrated by fan-trailers that can be found on YouTube that have been uploaded by Dorothy Lover; interested parties simply need to search the preceding titles of Oz books and type ""official trailer"" after the title: i.e. ""The Road to Oz official trailer"" is very interesting to view and reveals how to adapt the book into a film.
 And ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is a remake of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2"", ""Justice League: The New Frontier"", ""Superman: Doomsday"", and ""Wonder Woman (2009)"".
---at least ""Total Recall (2012)""  is good because the casting has better actors than the original, and ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" has a very good cast and compelling story that only partially remakes an idea from the second Terminator film for a few episodes but then ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles""  morphs into its own unique and captivating story about a mother training her son to fight a war which also has the story honor other philosophical source material such as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz books by clearly and cleverly referring to the novels written by L. Frank Baum.
----but ""Allegiant"" is not a remake, it is its own original story and unique film.

A secondary reason for ""Allegiant"" being a good film is due to its commentary about social-classes.  Unlike the Hunger Games series that is about government fighting factions---which has been done to death in films---""Allegiant"" and its film series focus on social-classes and determining how one can move between the social-classes and then use government to change the social-classes.  Therefore, ""Allegiant"" is more unique with its Sci-fi story because it comments on the validity of social-classes which not so many films have done as interestingly as ""Allegiant"".  But ""Allegiant"" is enthralling and is much aligned to the commentary about social-classes that is found in the good science fiction films ""The Matrix"" and ""Jupiter Ascending""---both of these good films also cleverly pay tribute to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz books, especially ""Jupiter Ascending"" since it is actually combination of several of the fantasy stories written by L. Frank Baum that are then made to look like science fiction.

Finally a third reason that makes this film good: ""Allegiant"" is not mindless action like Star Wars.  Whereas Star Wars just gives fight after fight with clearly identified good and bad people, ""Allegiant"" is more intelligent Sci-fi because the characters are not simply good or bad and this causes a viewer to be unable to accurately predict what will occur from a character.  Furthermore, because characters have complex personalities they do engage in philosophical discussions about a society's existence and that is what intelligent Sci-fi should strive for. ""Allegiant"" deliberates in such a manner and therefore it makes it a thought provoking film.

Thusly, since ""Allegiant"" is not a remake nor is it a sequel that ""captures the spirit of the original film""---viewers need to learn this new code from critics because that wording actually means the film is a remake---""Allegiant"" is good.  It has complex characters and it engages in philosophy, that coupled with its original story makes ""Allegiant"" a refreshing film to see as so many film studios bring on the remakes or release remakes disguised as sequels.",1464825600,9,5280,4.930101465614431
7687782,1,B01CP0Q8S0,This whole movie was fille with nothing. All the actors looked bored with their roles and the effects were pretty bad. Also the movie is very boring trying to expand the final book into 2 and this goes to show its not working out in that case. This movie is a let down.,1464134400,18,269,4.09433962264151
7687783,2,B01CP0Q8S0,"Heading into the third film based on Veronica Roth's best-selling YA trilogy, ""The Divergent Series: Allegiant"" has settled into its mediocre place in the genre. It's not quite a blockbuster like, say, ""The Hunger Games"" or ""Twilight"", but it isn't a disaster either. That divergence (no pun intended) is reflected in the films themselves, with the first one a dull talker that struggled to explain the complicated faction-based dystopia of the story's setting. The sequel, ""Insurgent"", was far superior as it ditched the bland stuff for more guns, more actions, bigger visual effects, more more more. With ""Allegiant"", the first half of the franchise finale, there seems to be no clear focus about what this film is supposed to be, and there's definitely not enough story to sustain two movies when it can barely carry one.

If you haven't seen the first two ""Divergent"" films then ""Allegiant"" is probably the worst time to become a fan because there's no attempt to explain anything, not that it would have made any sense. One of the biggest problems with Roth's series, and it has been amplified in the adaptations, is that the future society these characters exist in is utterly ridiculous and unconvincing. Shailene Woodley and the mountain-voiced Theo James are back as polished lovebirds Tris and Four, who have survived the attack by Jeanine and her plot to destroy ""divergents"". What are divergents? Ehhhhh, well, they're sorta like mutants except not at all. See, in the Chicago they live in, society was divided up into ideological factions. Divergents were able to rise above all of that and be themselves. Now in ""Allegiant"" the faction system is destroyed, but there's no peace because Four's mother (Naomi Watts) wants total control while a rebel group (led by Octavia Spencer) has splintered off.

Get all that? Well, there's more, and it involves Tris, Four, the devious Peter (Miles Teller), and Tris' back-stabbing brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) fleeing Chicago into a cheap-looking technological city where the Bureau of Genetic Warfare is being run by a mysterious man named David (Jeff Daniels) There they learn Chicago has been watched over by the Bureau, ""Truman Show""-style, in hopes of helping humanity recover from the effects of a genetic war. The whole thing is stupidly convoluted, but the details that could have helped flesh this world out are presented in a dismissive fashion. However, if you really need a reminder of the franchise's core theme of individuality, it will be explained to you ad nauseum in one of many variations on Leaders need to make tough decisions to protect the people. Worst of all, Tris is relegated to background duty as the most gullible person on the planet, a take on her character that fans of the strong-willed book version will deplore. It's hardly the only change the film makes from the books, too, and few of them add anything of value.

Normally these films are carried on the capable shoulders of star Shailene Woodley, but even she looks as disengaged as we are. The same goes for Watts, Daniels, Teller, and...well, it's hard to tell if James is bored because his expression never changes, anyway. Perhaps it's the green screen overload, the utter reliance on CGI that has the cast so listless. This is the second Divergent film directed by Robert Schwentke, and while the effects fit for ""Insurgent"" which was all runnin' and gunnin', the slower-paced ""Allegiant"" could have done with more tangible effects. Coincidentally, Schwentke quit the franchise after this, citing exhaustion. You can feel the cast and crew's fatigue permeating every frame of ""Allegiant"", and sadly there's still one more to go.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Divergent-Series-Allegiant-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-HD/dp/B01FGQG7CW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Divergent Series: Allegiant [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD</a>]",1463788800,23,3909,5.301612903225807

Critics may have not liked it but forget about them because they are stupid and dumb. From the first scene to the last, you are on the edge of your seat. For the people who have read the books, the movie has differences but takes the main ideas from the Allegiant book and puts them in there. Since the last movie is being split into two parts, you tell half of the story, so if you have only half of a story there will be more time left. And that's why they have the differences.

The movie did a great job at presenting the material from the book in a very visual way. Were there things left out from the books? Yes, because this is a different medium with a limited timeline. I thought a lot of the things they took out needed to be, like all the excessive FourTris bickering, though the tension was still there between the main characters. Also, I thought that they did a great job at explaining the GD/GP elements that the book did not do as well. And finally, they did a better job at making the supporting cast, Christina, Caleb and Peter more active in the story. Overall a great movie. It was too bad that the fans didn't continue to support it like they did the previous movies because it was really well done.

Allegiant is of course based on the third book of the Divergent series and is regarded by a lot of fans as the weakest installment of the series and their feelings towards this movie is essentially the same way. Allegiant is by no means a great movie but it wasn't as bad as what a lot of people label it as. It does have some good action sequences, above average performances, and a decent story. However, the story does have its flaws as it has a few plot points that don't make sense and a few aspects that left me a little confused. Another flaw I have is the ending, which left me a little disappointed as it doesn't quite work well with the movie's story. Like I said, the movie isn't great but I don't hate it like a lot of people do. If you liked the first two movies, you'll probably like this one.

7687794,2,B01CP0Q8S0,"If you've never read a book in the Divergent series, you may have actually liked this film, but as someone who read the series, and thought that Allegiant was the best book of that series, I am disgusted by what Hollywood turned in into. Entire storylines and major themes are just ripped out of the story, not to mention character mysteriously vanished without explanation, and where did all this technology come from? The bureau is supposed to be this weakly funded entity, not the premier power in the outside world, the whole thing just made me sick. After the first ten minutes, the film greatly diverges from the book, in a way that is incomprehensible to those who read it. The story, which is the final book but not the final film, takes place as people are racing to leave the city and are stopped by the factionless. Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her group knows that they must find out what is on the other side of the wall and launch a daring escape, which was far more difficult than portrayed in film. When they get outside the wall, the group finds out what the world is like outside of Chicago, and it's like nothing they could have ever imagined, and it's nothing like Veronica Roth described it in the book. I understand that Hollywood needs to fit entire novels into two hour films and inevitably somethings just won't make the cut, but what's missing here are major chunks of the story. Maybe they are saving it for Ascendant, which is due out a year from now, but even then they would be so out of order, that the film series just wouldn't make any sense. If you're a fan of the series, you really need to read the books. Allegiant might be one of the best stories you've ever read and when you see what Hollywood did to it, you'll be as pissed off as I am.",1459987200,85,1776,4.4176829268292686

I mean really escape as they climb Trumps' wall, however not without a casualty... PLOT SPOILER token hot Asian chick (Maggie Q) dies early. They make their way into the contaminated post apocalyptic world, moving into a plot giving me ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" flashback. Here they meet civilization as we await one more twist as there is too much time left in the film for they not to be one.

Except for Peter (Miles Teller) the acting was stiff. Jeff Daniels as Director David didn't add anything. I would have changed this up a bit and put in a flaky Woody Harrelson type of guy. The film had great ""1984"" style lines like, ""Your destiny begins today."" I kept attempting to get a theme from the film such as the role of propaganda and recreating the past for the betterment of a diverse society, but it was presented lightly if indeed it was meant to be there. Perhaps those who read the books could shed some light on the theme.

But, when this takes Tris et al. into the larger world, the plot has trouble keeping up with the larger vision. The action is great - I'm not sure where stunts ended and green screens took over, and don't want to know. but after that, it seems to flatten. Evil mind-control serum: got one. Machiavellian autarch, playing everything close to his chest: yup. Traitorous one-time friend: yawn, check that box, too. Cool guns'n'stuff: of course. None of those are bad things, but brilliance of script, direction, and acting can do what a master chef does: make ordinary ingredients into something truly memorable. Sorry, didn't happen.

In part, this movie seemed not to recognize that people might have missed or forgotten the personality clashes established in the earlier movies. Lacking (or forgetting) that background, I found myself with lots of WTF moments trying to remember why person X was such a jerk. There's a balance to keep, between dropping the novice (or the forgetful) into the middle of the conversation, vs. some big lecture on how we got where we are. It's a tightrope that can be walked, and often is. This fell off the rope a few steps in.

I'm sure there will be another in the series, and I'm sure I'll see it. But, given how much Divergent and Insurgent drew me in, this wasn't the continuation I hoped for.

7687799,3,B01CP0Q8S0,"We should be wrapping up another Young Adult trilogy (is there any other kind?) but I discovered that a fourth (!) chapter is in production, so this is Part 1 of 2. The faces and names are familiar, so it won't take much additional information to set the stage. Most of the big surprises were revealed in ""Insurgent,"" so Tris and Four perilously escape beyond the wall that encircles Chicago. Now our heroic band has its work cut out.

Returning from his ""Insurgent"" duties, director Robert Schwentke once again helms this non-stop actioner. Unfortunately, that's all there is: Action. Action, gunfire and blowie uppie stuff. The story is flimsy and convoluted, the locations are Computer Generated Imaging, and we in the audience are jaded. To me, the only interesting exceptions are a derelict O'Hare Airport and those gauzy translucent bags that envelope our principals once in awhile. Incidentally, Schwentke will not be coming back to direct Part 2; maybe he too, is weary.

Here is part of the cast:
  * Shailene Woodley (""The Descendants"") is Tris, the misfit who diverges from the standard attributes that would have allowed her to take her place in one of the five factions that made up her world. Now of course, all of that has been thrown into a tailspin, so she and her cadre of rebels must deal with it.
  * Theo James (""Insurgent"") Four has become central to our heroine's plans and now they are both in jeopardy. Unfortunately, his mother is partly to blame.
  * Miles Teller (""Whiplash"") They say ""everyone is worth saving,"" so Peter gets another chance... against our better judgment.
  * Zo Kravitz (""X-Men"") Christina has been with our heroine from the beginning and continues to be loyal and resourceful. I wish this lovely young actress had more to do but occasionally show up on screen.
  * Naomi Watts (""Undertaking Betty"") Evelyn has embraced the adage: Leaders must make hard choices. A last-ditch effort to secure her position backfires when she jeopardizes her own son.
  * Octavia Spencer (""The Help"") Johanna was a leader when her world was divided into factions. She is still a leader, only now her weapons are commitment and fervor.
  * Ansel Elgort (""The Fault in Our Stars"") returns as our heroine's brother Caleb. He has mad computer skills and is very bright, but he's not brave.
  * Jeff Daniels (""The Martian"") David is in an awkward position. His plans for the future center around Tris, whom he sees as a perfect human specimen. Problem is, she is also smart.

This is rated PG-13, so you can expect very little profanity, no sweaty bodies and only partial nudity. Unfortunately, this movie lasts for 121 minutes, that means we're stuck with over two hours of fisticuffs, running, shooting and blowing stuff up. Oh! and some icky orange smoke... Aarghhh!

These Young Adult series (""Twilight,"" ""The Hunger Games,"" and ""Divergent"") have brought us some outstanding young actresses (Kristen Stewart, Jennifer Lawrence and Shailene Woodley), who have managed to anchor their series, survive the rigors of super-stardom and, despite being saddled with twaddle like this, have begun to create respectable bodies of work that will hold up over the long haul.

Much of that has to do with the fact that this is only the first part of two films based on the last book by Veronica Roth.  As if that hasn't happened before.  And like those other films, e.g. The Hunger Games, this is nothing more than a money grab for the studios.  And like those other films, it is a weak entry.  And this series is no Hunger Games.

Still, I don't think it is as horrible as nearly every critic suggests.  I actually found it moderately entertaining in spite of some pretty bad performances by some pretty good actors.  There isn't a whole lot new here.  With Jeanine (Kate Winslet) being killed in the last film (Insurgent), the vacuum is being filled jointly by Fours (Theo James) mom, Evelyn (Naomi Watts) and Johanna (Octavia Spencer).  In a blink-and-youll-miss-it power struggle, Evelyn becomes the top dog in the hierarchy.  Four and Tris (Shailene Woodley) decide they don't like living in Chicago and decide to breach the wall (Donald Trump is taking notes I suspect) and head for unknown territory.  Along with a few comrades, Christina (Zoe Kravitz), Caleb (Ansel Elgort), Peter (Miles Teller) and Tori (Maggie Q), the group head for who knows where.

With Evelyns goons close behind, they are saved by some military types whose leader, David (Jeff Daniels), offers sanctuary.  As it turns out, even though Four and Tris are considered Divergent, that is special, only Tris is super special or pure.  You know, shes not damaged.  And I don't mean that in a sexual way.  So Tris becomes Davids pet subject and he only answers to the Counsel.  This setting is at the old OHare Airport.  Christina: Whats an airport? It isn't hard to figure out that David isn't what he seems and his motives are mixed, even if you haven't read the book or seen a trailer.

The film has some decent special effects and action sequences but that doesnt really set it apart from dozens of other films.  I think the problem with this Robert Schwentke (R.I.P.D.) directed film is that it is stale and well past its expiration date.  No matter how technically well done the movie is, it represents nothing new and at best, just sets up the last installment (due in June of 2017).

7687802,4,B01CP0Q8S0,"I read the book series and liked how Divergent was translated to the screen. I didn't care for the treatment of Insurgent, mostly because it didn't stay true to the book. Allegiant doesn't, either, but I am not disappointed. I will not divulge anything here (I hate spoilers), and hope everyone else extends the same courtesy. There are plenty of fan sites where you can go and gush over, or hate, the film. I think that, unlike Insurgent, the treatment of Allegiant makes sense. Considering where Insurgent left off, this is as good as it can be. By all means see the film and judge for yourself. I can be as cranky as anyone when a book I enjoy isn't translated to a film word-for-word, but I don't feel cranky about this one :o)",1458432000,4,731,4.462686567164179
7687803,1,B01CP0Q8S0,"So, here is my nonspoiler review of the third movie in this series. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I said it would be a NONSPOILER review.

I have never felt so compelled to write a poor review in my life. I usually won't even write a review if I can't give the author or the movie at least 4 stars. I believe that if the author sits down and writes a story to share it with the world, who am I to rain on their parade and say that it is bad? I have an opinion. Everyone does. Just because I don't like some movies or books doesn't mean others won't enjoy them. We're all different. With that being said, here is my honest opinion of #Allegiant...

If I could give less than 1 star, I would.

Wow! What a disappointment. The book pissed me off at the end. If you've read the third book in this series, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Total story suicide, IMO. However, the ending of the movie does NOT end the same way as the book. You think 'GOOD', right? Meh... I don't know about that. Not once during this movie did my pulse rate rise. It. Was. Boring. There was a lot of action in the book. The movie fell flat. Flat as a damn pancake. There were some cool things, like the drones and... well, that's about all. I could tell by the special effects that they spent a lot of money to make the movie. They just didn't pull it off. Whoever wrote the script needs to be fired, because WTF? If you want to waste your money to see it for the simple fact that you read all the books and have to see all the movies, too, go ahead. But if someone had told me what I'm telling you now, I would have saved the $30 I spent at the theater and the two hours I wasted to watch the thing. Don't say nobody warned you.",1458432000,2,1718,4.032258064516129
