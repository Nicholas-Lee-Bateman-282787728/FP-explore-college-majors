5169957,5,B008MIYKSU,"My dad was once telling me about the TV shows he used to watch when he was younger and he
mention Combat and told me that he used to love it at a child. I went online and found it here and
he loved it. I think this would make a perfect fathers day gift.",1359504000,6,253,3.618181818181818
5169958,5,B008MIYKSU,All I can say is: Fantastic DVD Collection to own if you're a Combat fan and the price was right!!,1358035200,2,98,3.95
5169959,5,B008MIYKSU,"I grew up watching the Combat series on TV and it is amazing how many years ahead of its time it was.  It takes you down to the human level of combat during World War II - the street fighting, hand-to-hand combat, and stress involved in facing danger and death on the battlefield.  The acting is superb - they just don't make these nitty gritty type actors anymore.  These guys all know and practice their craft fantastically.  They make the most of the technology of their day.  A must for all military veterans and those who enjoy war movies.  Great value for the money.  Buy this series - you will not be disappointed.  Hard to stop watching once you start.  Enjoy!",1356739200,15,668,4.454545454545454
5169960,5,B008MIYKSU,This collection is great for a fan of the show who enjoys the favorite episodes in lieu of other discs.  If you have other discs from the show you may find an overlap in episodes.,1356566400,,179,4.114285714285714
5169961,4,B008MIYKSU,"Where this set really shines is in showing how well Combat! portrayed regular guys just trying to survive the war. No glorious heros, in fact this set shows (in part) how much of a slog everyday life was -- punctuated by moments of sheer terror.

Why 4 stars and not 5? While I understand why the set wants to showcase some of the guest stars on one of the DVDs, it does so at the expense of leaving out several of Vic Morrow's, Rick Jason's and the other regulars best episodes.

Not to be missed: the episodes that Vic Morrow directed are motion-picture worthy.",1356566400,7,563,4.403846153846154
5169962,5,B008MIYKSU,"It is great for a "" best"" of...
Have the 152 episodes too
Gave a copy to a Vet of Korea too",1353024000,4,91,3.1818181818181817
5169963,1,B008MIYKSU,"""Combat"" is a great show and the episodes on this disc are the cream of the entire series and I loved them all. The problem is it turns out I already own these episodes because they provide no description of what the 20 episodes are and all of them have already been released. IF YOU OWN BEST OF THE SQUAD, BEST OF NEW REPLACEMENTS, BEST OF ESPIONAGE, BEST OF HANLEY, BEST OF SAUNDERS, you already have what's on this set like I do. The seller is ripping off the public by not listing the episodes so I'm giving fans of this series a heads up. What you basically get is the ""Best of Episodes"" in slim pack form which is great--if you don't already own these shows and ok if the seller told us that's what your getting--but they don't. If your gonna buy this set--buy it from importcds like I did--they rock as a seller.",1351036800,37,819,4.256410256410256

5169978,4,B008MIYKSU,"Yes, a great series and a memorable one.  Morrow was a fine actor and exceptionally well-cast for his role in the series.  A sad and unnecessary loss in the '82 Twilight Zone Movie  movie set accident.  The series' gritty realism and superb performances by many guest stars were a welcome antidote to the hi jinx from the usual historical Hogans Heroes or F Troop fare broadcast at the same time--even more so than other realistic war dramas like ""Rat Patrol"". Before films like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Combat presented heroism and serious human dramas in a tight, yet exciting fifty minutes that keeps the viewer's attention until next week 's adventure. Few shows broadcast today can even manage that.",1415318400,,702,4.923728813559322

5169986,5,B008MIYKSU,"I enjoyed this black and white television series back when it was on the air and I was a pharmaceutical salesman in central Texas.
A realistic look at life as an Army infantryman during the long and bloody march from the shores of Normandy to total victory over Nazi Germany almost a year later. June, 1944 to May 1945.
I realized as I watched Sergeant Chip Saunders and his squad of a cross section of American young men of the 1940s battle enemy soldiers why I had chosen Navy blue over Army olive drab for my war time service.
Sergeant Saunders was an expert with the famous .45 caliber Thompson sub-machine gun.
A sub-machine gun is a full automatic weapon firing a pistol caliber cartridge.",1404864000,,695,4.568
5169987,5,B008MIYKSU,I had to have this one. I watched Combat every week on TV when I was a kid. Still watch it today. Was really happy to be able to get some of the episodes on DVD.,1399766400,,161,3.5

5169989,5,B008MIYKSU,"I got this for my younger brother. We used to stay up late at night and watch this when we were young, and it was a favorite show of ours. He was a Vic Marrow fan, and I was a Rick James fan. This is a great compilation of episodes, and at the price, well worth it.",1395446400,2,265,3.6666666666666665

5169991,5,B008MIYKSU,"I started watching this show on METV on my cable network every night, and after a month, they took the show down to 1 day a week and it was on at 2 am, so I had to record it. My wife found this collection and got it for me for Christmas. Last week when our cable went out because of the -16 degree weather, I had something to watch. I am completely happy with this series of combat. The picture quality is excellent. As a matter of fact, I am in the processor of looking for more series that I can add to this collection. If you like the older black and white war series, I would recommend this series to anyone.",1389398400,3,612,3.983739837398374
5170021,5,B008MIYKSU,"Sgt. Saunders is the greatest philosopher / warrior since Marcus Aurelius.  He is a WW-II battlefield life coach who teaches us all with a few powerful words and many strong deeds how to face the world bravely and justly.  He is the epitome of man as a natural leader.
COMBAT! is the best television show ever made.  I watched it as a kid after school with my mother as she did the ironing.  Its depiction of WW-II and the life of a squad and their leader is realistic and compelling.  It is so much more than just a war show as the topics covered from one episode to the next run the gamut of human experience.",1382486400,7,611,4.232758620689655

5170028,5,B008MIYKSU,"You cannot go wrong buying Combat!  If you bought all of these DVD's separately it would cost over $40.  Combat! was one of the very best TV Series of the 60's.  They don't make TV like they used to.  This was a great series, and an unbelievable bargain.  I can't say enough about this series, great drama and music.  The Germans actually speak German.
