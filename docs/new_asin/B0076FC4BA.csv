5057497,4,B0076FC4BA,"Same review I had of Lamb's ""Drills Part II"" vid.
Plenty of good tips in here and it is filmed very well- lots of camera angles used.
Kyle isn't a desk-jockey theory guy.
I think his DVDs are great additions to a training library.

No 5 stars because of a couple things:
The flying bullet into a VTAC target and lightning graphics and macho metal music between chapters/drills takes up a lot of time.
These seques/buffers between scenes occur between every darn drill and last way too long.
A simple panel saying ""Drill 3-- the Bill Drill"" for 5 seconds would be fine.  Throw in some lighting if you really need to but 5 seconds is tops for a buffer.
Second peeve is that both my DVDs skip and get hung up in several places.  Probably not run off by a high quality DVD place?

Great content, great instruction and certainly recommended.",1387497600,4,836,4.480263157894737
5057498,1,B0076FC4BA,Very poor quality video. A must not buy. A bunch of students shooting boring drills. The way to film the sequences makes them uninteresting. Get Magpul videos instead.,1383782400,2,167,5.0
5057499,5,B0076FC4BA,Very informative video for anyone interested furthering their education/familiarity with a pistol. 5 star due to the content and directly to the point.  Makes you want to get out there and start practicing.,1354838400,2,206,5.242424242424242

8510885,5,B0076FC4BA,"Well done and well demonstrated pistol tactics.  Professional in quality of production.  The demonstrating individuals are real shooters, not actors.",1491609600,,149,6.4
8510886,5,B0076FC4BA,"Great dvd on drills and compliments Kyle Lambs books very well. I think this set is better than magpuls even if the production isn't as well done and itll cost quite a bit more for the whole set but Kyle Lamb isn't into putting out fluff and magpul was more about looking cool and being flashy, nothing against Travis Haley hes also one of the best and his other two instructionals from panteo are fantastic but from the hour ive watched of magpul id say they were much more about entertainment.",1473292800,,495,4.450549450549451

8510890,5,B0076FC4BA,Is a great start to learning drills and then taking to the range especially if you have a basic knowledge of defensive pistols.,1430006400,,127,4.565217391304348
8510891,4,B0076FC4BA,"The information is great, but two discs from Viking cost more and do not have as much total info as a set of four from magpul, but i'm glad I have both viewpoints to consider.
 The companies agree on several point but disagree on some things, and it's always nice to know when there are options, and know what the companies find to be a matter of personal choice, versus things they agree are absolute best methods,",1408579200,,415,4.3896103896103895
8510892,5,B0076FC4BA,Kyle Lamb's training DVDs are superb.  You really don't need to say anything else.  I have both tapes as well as the AR15 tapes.  Great stuff.,1392854400,,142,4.384615384615385
