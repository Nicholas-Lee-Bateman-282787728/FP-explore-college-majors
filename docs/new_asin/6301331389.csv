324953,5,6301331389,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out. I was 39 at the time, so I could see myself in the picture (a little). The next night I took three women from my office to see the picture. Two of them had just gone through a divorce, and the third -- one of my best friends and working associates -- had been divorced at age 35 by a man who ""went crazy"". It was fun seeing the picture with those three women and seeing their reactions. After the movie we went to dinner at a steak house together and talked about the movie and had a wonderful evening together. As a man I think I did those three women more good by taking them to see ""Middle Age Crazy"" than anything else would possible do for them at that time in their life.

The picture is a little dated now, but if you are a 39/40, man or woman or have been in a troubled relationship -- this is a great movie to see.",1108944000,10,879,3.938202247191011
324954,5,6301331389,"MIDDLE AGE CRAZY is one unforgettable movie and Bruce Dern is every ordinary guy just entering his own mid-life crisis. Of course not every man has a nutty wife like the loveable dimwit played by Ann-Margaret.
It is Dern's private thoughts portrayed so humorously which help to make the film memorable. My view of high school graduations will never again be the same. I give the movie five stars partly because it contains many scenes which are still indelibly etched in my mind even after twenty years.",1041465600,10,503,4.793103448275862
324955,5,6301331389,"While the style and times of ""Middle Age Crazy"" have passed, the essence of the message and theme are constant. This is a must see for every man entering his 40's, and any female who wants to understand him better. Beside the familiar surface story line, there is a deeper underlying message about aging, changing, and letting go of previous self images. Bruce Dern is excellent as a man entering into middle age with all the stress of being the focus of parent, children, and family problems, while attempting to retain his own identity. In a time when our society is dealing with aging on a larger scale than ever before, this film is more relevant than ever. The musical score adds greatly to this effect, and the whole experience is universally significant.",1017792000,4,761,4.7293233082706765
324956,5,6301331389,".... The story revolves around a Texas man turning 40 and all the changes in his life that go along with this unpleasant milestone. His father dies, his son refuses to go to college because he wants to marry his girlfriend, he needs to find a home for his now widowed mother, his business is growing too fast for him to manage and his wife is making a big deal out of his turning 40, even counting her orgasms by screaming ""Bingo"" to compare their sex life now with that of their high school days,by the way Ann Margaret still looks hot in this one. The dream scenes that Dern has are classic, the speech at his son's high school graduation will have you nodding in understood approval ""give them back their damn diplomas, give them back their silly ... hats and stay 18 for the rest of your life"", or the one where his son's girlfriend is coming on to him while the song Good Girls Don't is playing or the one where his dead father ""sentences"" him to be the daddy, everyones daddy for the rest of his life, and of course the killer Porsche 928 scene where he is blasting down the highway with a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader on his arm passing Corvettes and giving the finger to the Highway Patrol (now who has not daydreamed of that!).....; or to tell your boss to stick it up his ..., or scream aloud to the heavens ""I don't want to be the daddy""...well this movie explores every bad thing and thankfully every good thing that goes along with the infamous midlife crisis. I was 16 when I first saw this film and now I am 36...holy smokes I am about to become the Dern charcter, I'd better go find a Cowgirl fast and trade my Ford for a fancy foreign sport car! Enjoy the film.",988243200,25,1675,4.287066246056782
324957,5,6301331389,"Bobby Lee has it all - a beautiful, devoted, loving wife, a successful business, good friends.  Turning 40 is no big deal, until his wife makes it one by insisting he's better than ever, and trying to make him prove it.  Bobby Lee suddenly sees a life full of ""strings"" - everybody  wants something from him, except the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader.  He rebels  from the life of his ""needy"" family, buys a sports car, gets the  Cheerleader.  He comes to realize that the fantasy life he has imagined is  not all it's cracked up to be.  I felt this was an insightful look into a  midlife crisis that many men face.  Suddenly, they are  the ""dad""  and everybody is looking to them for the answers - answers they never had,  or needed to have, because dad had them.  Watching Bobby Lee go through his  crisis helped me understand and deal more effectively with mine.",938822400,7,860,4.487012987012987
324958,4,6301331389,"this is the tale of a man faced with mid-life crisis. This is an overlooked classic, probably because most yuppies were still in their twenties when it was released. Great performance by BRUCE DERN AND ANN MARGRET.",915235200,6,214,4.8108108108108105

7810973,5,6301331389,"WHY is this not on DVD?  This movie seems very dated now, but eventually all movies do.  How can a movie this well liked and remembered not be on DVD at a reasonable price?  Thankfully I own this on VHS but I no longer have a working VHS player.  Although the entire movie is good, those daydreams Bruce Dern have are what makes the movie...epecially the high-school graduation speech, which once you see you will never forget!",1483401600,,427,4.5064935064935066

7810977,5,6301331389,"1980 saw the release of Middle Age Crazy, which I was lucky enough to see in the theatre. Ann-Margret starred as a wife who was abandoned by her husband. The reality of turning 40 is showed nicely.",1395619200,,197,4.351351351351352
7810978,5,6301331389,"Middle Age Crazy starring Bruce Dern and Ann Margeret is truly an underappreciated masterpiece.  The film tells the story of a moderately successful man going through the mid-life crisis that all of us face, or will face if we live long enough.  The story is completely believable, and insets of the central character's (Bobby Lee Burnett) day dreams are hillarious.  When he is at his son's high school graduation, and he is watching the class valedectorian giving the same old speech about ""We are the future...""  Bobby Lee Burnett begins to daydream, suddenly it is him on the podium giving the speech, and he tells the TRUTH about growing old, ""stay 17 forever!""  Even today, after have seen it many times, I still laugh at Bobby Lee Burnett's wonderful daydreams and speeches.  This movie needs to be available on DVD, it is truly one that every good film library should have.",1320364800,,881,4.801324503311259
