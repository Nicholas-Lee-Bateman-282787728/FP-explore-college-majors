7961871,4,B000066752,"This movie kept me interested from the very beginning. Asaka Seto is gorgeous and displays a lot of talent in this movie. I found a couple of minor characters a little annoying. Also, Maybe I'm mistaken but in one scene the assassin looks to have her sniper rifle scope on backwards. Some people might lose interest with this movie because there aren't that many action scenes, but I think if you give this movie a chance you will like it.",1297900800,,439,4.5

7961873,5,B000066752,"An excellent film with considerably more plot and character development than some Hong Kong productions.  Asaka Seto steals the show.  Her performance has depth and subtlety, and if you don't care much about such things just enjoy the fact that she's totally hot! There is plenty of action, bullets, blood and even a few quick martial arts sequences, but in addition, this flick also features a suspenseful, well written and well directed story. Very few flaws overall and very much worth the price. Plenty of websites have good plot summaries if you need more, but fans of H.K. Cinema will not be disappointed, and if you're not a fan yet this one's a great way to get acquainted!",1047945600,4,681,4.762711864406779
7961874,4,B000066752,"Bullets of Love is a Hong Kong action movie that has many very tender moments and even a few funny moments.  Hong Kong action star/singer Leon Lai plays a Hong Kong detective who, along with his prosecutor fiance (Asaka Seto), fights a nasty Hong Kong gang.  When the gang has Leon's fiance killed, he retires from the police force and tries to live a quiet life with his family in a fishing village.  One day Leon spots a woman who is a dead ringer for his dead fiance, and he falls in love with deadly consequences (that's three ""deads"" in one sentence--not bad, eh?--Hey, it's a Hong Kong film.  You gotta expect this kind of violence in a review).  Bullets of Love has the action and tongue-in-cheek humor you'd expect from a movie of this genre, but Japanese TV actress Asaka Seto is so effective at being both brutal and tender she is able to play different characters with the same face.  The result is startling.  She fully adds an extra dimension to this very effective film.  This DVD version is in Cantonese and English with English subtitles, and includes a ""making of"" documentary.",1033862400,7,1094,4.603092783505154
