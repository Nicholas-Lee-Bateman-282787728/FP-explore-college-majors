861223,5,6304360967,"Randy Quaid always adds a certain essence to the movies he's in; a bit of odd-ball humor.  Since he's one of the main characters in this one, the movie is definitely altered by his presence.  It's a little 'dark' and a little unsettling - or at least would be if it were happening to you!  (How could it be otherwise when you're trying to sell a dead dog?).  But nonetheless, dark, humorous, and entertaining.",1109116800,3,409,4.486486486486487
861224,4,6304360967,"Caught this late night on IFC. Pleasant surprise... lot of fun to watch and Randy Quaid was really good. The humor keeps you drawn, and i spent the next three weeks waiting for the pressure cooker. You could certainly watch  a lot worse.",948672000,4,237,4.511627906976744

7869817,5,6304360967,"Animal lovers will certainly relate to the death and task of burying a pet.  Michael (Frank Whaley) is waylaid by eccentric cab driver Jack Cloud
( Randy Quaid) while trying to complete a task for his girl friend Sarah ( Christine Harnos) his life turned upside down.  What begins as a simple
favor will become a bizarre, all-night quest to bury her recently deceased dog, Jasper.
Michael's quest, however, is not over yet.  A suspicious policeman stops Michael from finding a resting place for Jasper in a peaceful park.  Only
Michael's unwanted partner, Jack Cloud, and one final surprise, will determine whether Michael will at long last be able to bury Jasper.",1428364800,,664,4.901785714285714

7869819,4,6304360967,"This is one of those Eighties surrealist urban dark comedies that seem to take their cues from Martin Scorsese's ""After Hours"".  It's certainly different and quirky but not as transcendant as I would like.  Regardless there's plenty of good stuff to be mined here.  The underappreciated Randy Quaid gives a terrific turn as a demented cabbie who's trying to help stockbroker Frank Whaley sell his date's departed pooch.  The varied schemes are amusing from trying to pawn the late Jasper to a Chinese restaurant to going to a voodoo priest to channel the dog's spirit.  The film is kind of saddled with a wooden perfomance by Christine Harnos as the ""pressure cooker"" who is outacted by Jasper pre- and post-mortem.  Noteworthy is this is a product of Handmade Films, George Harrison's outfit, and lensed by Frederick Elmes who is best known for his work with David Lynch.",1346544000,,872,4.8979591836734695
7869820,5,6304360967,Great off-beat comedy about a boy and his dog. Randy Quade is his usual strange self as a taxi driver willing to go the extra mile for his riders...Try the soup next time you eat out...,1302912000,,185,4.166666666666667

The movie is just okay, but DEFINITELY read the book.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cold-Dog-Soup/dp/0140121552/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cold Dog Soup</a>",1299456000,,274,7.59375
7869822,5,6304360967,"I saw this movie probably a year or two after its release (channel surfing on Dish Network).  I wasn't surprised to see Frank Whaley, an under-appreciated B movie regular, but when Randy Quaid showed up as an illegal taxi, I knew nothing would be normal.  If you're seriously into a predictable plot or a story line which follows some logical progression, forget it.  With every stop of his taxi, you're hoping to see some resolution, but it never happens.  What you remember is all the craziness.  I don't even remember how it ended, but I remember it was one of the neatest flicks I've seen in a while.  When I saw it on Amazon, I ordered it so quickly I didn't realize it was a VHS!  I'll figure out a way to convert it, or something - it's well worth the trouble.  To use a quote from Nationl Lampoon's Radio Comedy Half-hour:  Once you've seen it, you'll never be able to say you didn't.""",1274659200,4,893,4.396341463414634
7869823,5,6304360967,"I saw it years ago... Loved it then, and haven't been able to find it since. Was surprised to see it on IMBD & Amazon both, but wasn't a bit surprised to see it wasn't available.

If you get a chance to see this movie, DEFINITELY watch it. You will be in the small crowd of about 20 people who can then verify it's just not a weird dream the other 19 had.

Seriously...People look at you like you are nuts if you try to explain the movie to them, and they usually will deny it even exists.

I just noticed I really didn't talk about the movie: it needs to be seen to be believed. It is, however, very good, and quite funny.",1166486400,10,623,4.008064516129032
7869824,4,6304360967,Up at 2:30 a.m. I happened to find this movie on Directv.  If you like silly shows you'll get a kick out of it.  I laughed pretty hard at the ridiculous scenarios.  I love Randy Quaid too.,1162252800,3,188,4.027027027027027
7869825,5,6304360967,Happened across this movie late one night; it was a twisted funny ride. Randy Quaid plays a cab driver that takes a young man on an all night journey to sell a dead dog. Each stop they make is more twisted and hilarious than the last. At the start of the night the young man just wants to spend the evening with a new female acquaintance; only to end up having to get rid of the family dog in the middle of a city late at night. Quaid happens along and leads this movie directly into comedy history. Great ride.,1155340800,6,511,4.12
