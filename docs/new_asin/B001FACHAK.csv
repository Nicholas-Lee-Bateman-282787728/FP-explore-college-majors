8301386,1,B001FACHAK,"If I could put -1, I would do it, because it is such of empty movie, I am so fool, that I spent money on it :(
Seems like that movie was made by second year acting school kids, who saw the camera the first time. Empty, could not keep your attention longer than for 2 minutes, no idea or style in that movie.
Complitly waste.
Do not be like me, bought that movie with expectation, that title good-movie good. No way!...",1236297600,4,418,4.109756097560975
