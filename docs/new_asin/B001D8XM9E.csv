3527769,5,B001D8XM9E,"Hector says some strange things. Why would he buy a set by someone, and then complain about the fact they haven't competed. He also complains about the techniques shown. The wristlocks for example were very popular moves in catch wrestling. Many of the matches were won by their use. Anyone who knew anything about catch wrestling would know this. Basically his complaint is that on his catch wrestling dvd set, Cecchine is teaching catch wrestling.
Personally I don't care if an instructor is a great fighter or not. I simply care about the quality of their product, and The Lost Art of Hooking is the best I've seen. It's also true that some of the greatest trainers in boxing history never boxed themselves. Similarly Greg Jackson is one of the top trainers in MMA right now. He has no competitive record.",1292457600,6,808,4.73758865248227
3527770,5,B001D8XM9E,"What I'm about to say here is barely any better than what Lockflow had already said regarding ""The Lost Art of Hooking"" series of DVDs. What I can say is that this may be one of the best Catch Wrestling instructional DVDs out there, and ""Snap, No Tap!"" series (also by Tony Cecchine) may be better, although I haven't gotten that one yet.

You can definitely won't go wrong with this one. Do not listen to the slander being spouted by people who has lesser credential than Tony Cecchine himself, as you'll know he's legitimate when you see his stuff. You can preview some of them up at youtube anyway, so that you'll know what these DVDs contain.

Reviewer beware on ""Hector Rico"" fellow here, who gave a highly unreliable and uninformed review for not only this item, but also many other items he reviewed as well.

To those of you who want to improve your grappling game, Tony Cecchine's DVDs and instructions are highly recommended.",1267488000,11,935,4.620481927710843
3527771,5,B001D8XM9E,"Lots of controversy regarding Tony Cecchine. All frabricated by Jake ""the snake"" Shannon. Shannon trained with Cecchine at a seminar than tried to go into business with Cecchine and was refused. Cecchine had his own thing, why go into business with someone else when he didn't have too? Shannon proceeded to join forums under the name Jake Wrestler and somehow got Joe Rogan and Eddie Bravo involved. They proceeded to attack Cecchine's credibility. They said he was a phony who learned his Catch from watching Fujiwara's submission master tapes. The only problem is their respective styles are different. They also said he didn't train with Stanley Radwan and that the endorsement Lou Thesz gave Cecchine was meaningless. Shannon even went to the lengths of saying that Thesz wasn't any good. In fact an overated wrestler and not a catch wrestler. All of this, because he wouldn't go into business with Shannon. To this day Rogan and Bravo realizing they were used and lied to, have not apologized to Cecchine. He was almost ruined by this. What kept him from being ruined? His tapes! Flat out the best series out there on catch and submission wrestling. If your looking for BJJ, this ain't it! The previous reviewer complains about Cecchine talking too much? What's he supposed to do use sign language? He explains every move , position and most importantly the principles behind them. I've seen a lot of instructionals over the years and there is none better. All you have to do is go on youtube and see for yourself or go on any of the big forums and get a review. Lockflow does an especially good review. It's a shame he was born with a genetic problem in his spine because we lost out on seeing him compete. You can read the whole story about scientific wrestlings scam and their attack on Tony Cecchine at proteinwisdom, add the com . Just type in Tony Cecchine in their search engine.",1264032000,30,1892,4.736363636363636
3527772,1,B001D8XM9E,"Folks I've been in and out of dojos, been in street fights, since I was a preteen. I've seen MMA evolve into this juggernaut. The only reason I bought this was because it sounded like Lou Thesz taught this man. Was I ever fooled. So Lou Thesz got paid money to make a video where he says he's good friends with Tony. They're not good at trick editing. He never said word for word ""I taught him everything I know"" (nor imply anything similar). I somehow forced myself to watch the first 3 dvds. I looked more into him. He's never been in a tournament, any form of mma fight, or boxing match, or anything. All he does on his dvds is 1) makes fun of the Gracies/BJJ yet he does the guillotine, arm bar, etc and says he's modified the move. 2 He goes on for hours just name dropping/history ""George Tragos"" 3 If it's not some cheesy wrist locks its a variation of it. A variation isn't a different move. 4 there's no actual wrestling, no breaking down moves. There's nothing new here. There's only like 5 moves and variations of  them. He lives in a fantasy world. He fabricated everything. That ""Radwan"" showed him Catch. Who's Stanley Radwan? He goes under different names and trolls me. LOOK HOW ALL HIS REVIEWS MAKE FUN OF ME. There's other DVDs out there by ex champions. Don't pay attention to this lunatic. Look how he insists his video is best seller. There's nothing he does that could help you in any fight.",1261094400,,1413,4.393129770992366
3527773,5,B001D8XM9E,I purchased THE LOST ART OF HOOKING about 2006 and it is a phenomenal source. Tony's stuff works.,1448841600,,97,4.444444444444445
3527774,5,B001D8XM9E,I can't say enough good things about the teaching on these dvds.  Thank you Tony and bruce.,1444608000,,91,4.352941176470588
3527775,5,B001D8XM9E,"After watching the series a few times, I must say that Tony Cecchine is a great teacher who pays attention to the crucial details of a successful wrestling move. I look forward to watching The Lost Art of Hooking over and over until I have memorized them all and,  hopefully find someone to practice with, although that may be a longshot after they see some of these moves demonstrated on video. After twelve seasons of scholastic and college wrestling, I am glad to have found what I thought scholastic wrestling would teach me, true submission wrestling!",1409529600,,556,4.791666666666667

3527777,5,B001D8XM9E,"This is a superb video series.  While there are many top-notch video series on the sporting use of grappling, there are very few that focus on grappling for self defense and/or combat.  This video series focuses on exactly that.  Mr. Cecchine presents ""hooking"" techniques, which are wrestling moves designed to incapacitate or even maim an opponent very quickly.  Most of these techniques are unsuitable for sporting competition, as they can very easily result in severe injury.  However, in a self defense scenario, such techniques may become necessary to protect one's life.
Mr. Cecchine provides excellent instruction throughout the videos, covering important details and providing multiple camera angles to clearly show the techniques.  Mr. Cecchine is outstanding both in his execution of technique and his ability to explain the technique.  I strongly recommend this video series to anyone interested in learning about the non-sporting, self defense side of grappling.",1365897600,7,975,5.547297297297297
3527778,5,B001D8XM9E,"Wow! What a set of DVD'S! If you love grappling you must have this collection! Period!. Tony teachers you with his no nonsense approach how to get, keep and use the advantage of knowing these techniques for real world as well as MMA type competitions.
I was like a sponge soaking in all the useful nuiances of this somewhat forgotten art form. A real must have collection for a serious competitor or just anyone intertested in how to defend themself in todays uncertain world.
Highly recommended.

In or about the year 2000 I discovered Tony's Catch Wrestling "" Hooking "" and found my art was far from complete.
I now have a renewed interset in grappling and can't wait to teach it. I have added Hooking to what I do.
This art is awesome and tony is a great teacher who will go down in history as one of it's best.
Anyone interested in self defense should buy this.",1326153600,2,501,4.122448979591836
3527781,5,B001D8XM9E,"Do not even listen to anyone who would tell you Tony is not for real, or that Catch does not work. I have fought and later coached NHB for many years, and these are some of the most useful and devastating techniques I have ever used or seen. I am rebuilding much of my coaching around it. THIS STUFF WORKS!!!  TONY is the man!",1296432000,6,326,4.09375

I've been studying Combat Submission Wrestling for about six months and looking to learn more about Catch as Catch Can Wrestling from the old school perspective.  This is an excellent overview with some great detail concerning Catch as Catch Can Wrestling. The focus here is submissions and Tony delivers showing how to improve and enhance traditional BJJ submissions the Catch Wrestling way.  I loved the ""step over toe hold"" move from inside the closed guard (aka: top scissor position), the double wrist lock information is very good.

8292402,5,B001D8XM9E,"Tony Cecchine has a unique way of teaching his brand of catch as catch can and I must say I like it a lot.  Little things he teaches such as, adding the twist to the double wrist lock and top wrist lock are what I found particularly useful.  His two dvd's on ground control (included in this set) are definitely on the money.  This was my first ever instructional on catch wrestling that I bought and have learned a great deal from it.
