5279827,2,B009934S5M,"Less lens flares than the first film - Good. Slightly less violent 'shaky cam' than the first film - Good. Actors settling nicely into their roles - Good. Simon Pegg - very good, but Scotty still too much a figure of fun. The Klingon makeup and costumes - excellent: these are an elegant warrior people I'd like to see more of, even if the Trek TV series of the 80's and 90's DID over-use the Klingons. The 'Enterprise' Engineering and bridge sets are still ugly, garish, not ergonomic looking and seem like an OSHA nightmare!! STORY: I thought that the rogue-agent terror plot was a good idea and had far less holes and illogical ""WTFs?!"" than the first movie. But there were still a couple sequences that didn't make sense - the worst being the 'Enterprise's near-crash. One moment they're orbiting the Moon (400,000kms away), the next - suddenly they're right above the Earth's atmosphere and falling?! And where were other Starships, Ferries, Liners or other vehicles that could give them a tug with tractor beams - only two spaceships in the Earth-Moon system? I don't think so!! Also, I liked it that Kirk got bad kharma for his arrogance and insubordination and that many felt he didn't deserve the Captaincy only three years or so out of the Academy. Even by the end of the first movie he did NOT deserve that Captaincy - he did NOT earn it. And then when 'John Harrison's' true identity was revealed I groaned and did a facepalm - and even more so when Spock screamed 'Harrison's' true name later on in rage!!

JJ Abrams and his writers have delivered a spectacular film, one I feel is a slight improvement over the first. But it's impossible for me to overlook its many flaws - not the least of which is the director and writers seeming inability to stop cannibalizing the Star Trek of old. It's like trying to play an old tune in a different key on a shiny new fiddle - but it's still an old tune. The universe of Star Trek has a thousand potential tunes - try and write some new ones, guys...  First film I rate C+plus. 'Into Darkness', I rate C-minus.

EDIT: Added salient points - I've noticed that for many years Star Trek movies LOVE TO hang around Earth. Star Trek: TMP - Vejur threatens Earth. Wrath Of Khan - has significant scenes set on Earth. The Search For Spock - has significant scenes set on Earth. The Voyage Home - a threat to Earth and most scenes set there (love the movie, though). The Final Frontier - has significant scenes set on Earth. The Undiscovered Country - has significant scenes set on Earth. Generations - has significant scenes set on Earth. First Contact - a threat to Earth and most scenes set there (love the movie, though). Insurrection: wait for it - HAS NO SCENES SET ON EARTH WHATSOEVER!! Nemesis - has significant scenes set on Earth and the baddie is heading there in his weapon of mass destruction. Star Trek: Reboot AND Nemesis - has significant scenes set on Earth and the baddie is heading there in his weapon of mass destruction. Into Darkness: Bloody planet Earth - AGAIN!!

Anyone see a pattern here?! INSURRECTION: Only ONE Star Trek film that has NOTHING to do with planet Earth...",1368316800,8,3143,4.577264653641207
5279828,5,B009934S5M,"I'm a mediocre trekkie. Not diehard, but I do love the old series and original cast movies. THIS movie is equal fave with Star Trek 2 and 6. The new team of writers and director really GET the essence of the original show.",1368316800,13,222,4.186046511627907
5279829,3,B009934S5M,"I am a longtime Trekkie and was of course in the cinema at the first chance and today again. Therefore I update my review after the second view but I don't change the original rating.

By the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B007ZQJN1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>&nbsp;Videogame I don't understand the bad reviews and at this movie I don't understand all the positive reviews from the daily press.

I am a huge Star Trek fan since TNG and these days they are releasing the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Season-Three-Blu-ray/dp/B00B7VZN76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season Three [Blu-ray</a>] of the 3rd season and therefore I am looking it again. There are light years between TNG and the new Star Trek. Would Picard beat a prisoner which has capitulated? Would he works on an assassination mission? Would he kills a troop of Klingons when there is another way? I think no. The old Star Trek was about morale and to show a better way to live for the people on this planet. Star Trek Into Darkness (STID) is cold and militaristic. The Federation is no longer a research institution. They now wear grey uniforms and ugly military caps. Furthermore you can see in many scenes armed guards.

About the old Star Trek - before JJ Abrams - scientist like Lawrence M. Krauss wrote books about the brilliant science in Star Trek for example&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Physics-of-Star-Trek/dp/B0087WYNH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Physics of Star Trek</a>, about JJ Abrams version of Star Trek you couldn't wrote a single scientific paper.

In addition the terroristic topic doesn't fit to Star Trek. In the world of Star Trek the people normally have solved these petty conflicts between humans. Furthermore I can't understand Harrisons motive to hate the Federation? The Federation is not his enemy it is only a single Admiral. But this was also a problem of Star Trek XI and I think that the writers Ocri, Krutzman and Lindelof are not good enough to write a believable antagonist.

I enjoyed - inspite all the flaws - the last Star Trek movie and I like the new Crew. I think it was a good start but at STID JJ Abrams is too far away from the optimistic vision of Gene Roddenberry. When I am watching a Scifi movie like Star Trek I don't want the same sh.. as I can see in the daily TV news.

I want a promising message. I want an ethical behavior of the Crew of the Enterprise. I want diplomatic and science topics. And I want more screentime for Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Scotty (Simon Pegg) and McCoy (Karl Urban) - thay are all fantastic actors and they deserve it.

Therefore I am happy that JJ Abrams is now working on the next Star Wars movie (since the dull Episode I-II everything else is an improvement). And I hope that therefore Brannon Braga or Ronald D. Moore (the old TNG writers) get a chance to change the course of Star Trek.

Conclusion: Star Trek Into Darkness is a fast Scifi-movie full of action. The visuals are cool but good and the soundtrack is great. Unfortunately this is no longer the Star Trek I love.",1367971200,18,3252,5.240384615384615

Note: This takes place in an alternate universe from the TV series (and is not the Terran Empire either). I'm not giving you a spoiler. This is set up in the opening of the first movie, which is why I mention this here. If you know Star Trek or Star Trek Discovery, this movie will not make much sense without seeing the first reboot movie. The characters and situation will seem all wrong, and that is explained in the first movie (which I also think is more entertaining.)

That said, the persona of most of the characters remained. Uhura was the exception, which was welcomed since she never got a whole lot of the main attention other than going along for the ride. This Khan was not as charismatic as the old one. To make up for his clever back and forth with Kirk, we get to see his intellect and savagery instead. That is a fair trade as far as I am concerned. Hater of JJA just cannot resist stomping on anything he does so I dismiss their critiques once they speak their true mind. On their own this new range of Star Trek movies are better than pretty good.

I mean are writers so bad, or do the movie studios make them all into wh0res, that they need to write this crap?  Seriously, Star Trek is a Sci Fi, not a comedy, yet, that is what this has become.  Humor is good, but where they go is just dumb.  I have to add the direction they have taken Kirk is pretty stupid.  I mean really.  Did any of these writers ever serve?

5279914,4,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness(2013)  is an enjoyable Star Trek film. A terrorist called John Harrison(Benedict Cumberbatch) declares war on the United Federation of Planets. While hunting for him on the Klingon homeworld, they find out his real name is Khan Noonien Singh! The older Spock tells the younger Spock who Khan really is! They also find out that Admiral Marcus(Peter Weller) is in cahoots with Khan. Admiral Marcus is armed with the U.S.S. Vengeance, a scary looking starship. The film starts out on a fun note with a primitive race of people drawing the Starship Enterprise in the dirt and the editor dissolves into a shot of the Starship Enterprise going into warp speed. Holy cow! Alice Eve looks hot and sexy as a young Carol Marcus. For cheap laughs, Kirk stares at her as she's half nude!  There's a cool scene where the Enterprise spins out of control in space; you can see Kirk and Scotty run up the sides of walls. The scene where ""Spock dies"" is shamelessly rehashed in the film. Kirk and Carol use the
""S word"" a lot in the PG-13 version of the movie. Now, pass the flipping salt! J.J. Abrams went on to direct Star Wars The Force Awakens(2015) and Justin Lin was hired to direct Star Trek Beyond(2016). Star Trek Into Darkness is a solid Star Trek film.",1520812800,,1270,4.615044247787611

5279953,4,B009934S5M,"I am a fan of the Star Trek reboot, especially of the first two movies, the second being my favorite. It was a very clever re-thinking of the series and I especially like the Pine/Quinto chemistry on screen.
This is meant not only as a review of the present 4K version, but as an assessment of the new medium. I think the home theater industry has created a parallell universe of movie viewing, i.e. sharper, grainier presentaions, strong contrast with well saturated colors, etc, what clearly is nothing like the actual theatrical experience. Although not very old myself, as a kid I still enjoyed watching movies on 16mm celulloid on our Bell & Howell projector fitted with Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lenses, a thoroughly romantic and enjoyable viewing experience. Times have changed and the viewing experience has attained fabulous levels, but none surpasss the excitement of viewing a favorite movie with your family on a complete darkened room with the whirr of the projector on the background. But I digress...
Having taken the plunge into 4K realm, both 55"" TV and the wonderful Sony bdp X800 player, I have purchased some titles on 4K inlcuding the present one and Close Encounters to test what all the hubbub was about. Frankly, I'm still not convinced of upgrading former bluray titles to 4K UHD. This Star Trek chapter had always looked fantastic on bluray, still does on 4K, but no visible improvement to my eyes. Yes, I have read that as far as definition goes, the human eye cannot  perceive much difference beyond 1080p, and I start to agree. The true benefit of 4K which comes with the doubling of definition is a deeper palette of colours and better contrast. And this is perhaps the bonus of new 4K rig. I tell you I have thoroughly re-enjoyed my bluray collection that has played as if a veil has been lifted from the images. Classical movies on bluray look terrific with 4K upscaling! As I said before, I really do not feel the benefit of true 4K presntations, like for instance Close Encounters, that for my eyes looked better on the bluray copy included in the new combo packaging. This Star Trek title is a fabulous movie, but it doesn't seem to justify a 4K media. Upgrade your system, yes, but I'm still to be convinced of the UHD image upgrade.",1514505600,2,2269,4.701005025125628

However the increased brightness range offered with the HDR version is hugely beneficial especially when watching in a dark room. The contrasting highlights, lense flair and scene to scene brightness changes really increase the immersion. Highly recomend getting the 4k version.",1513209600,2,440,5.285714285714286

5280011,5,B009934S5M,"I liked it. The new 2009 J.J. Abrams era of Star Trek acts as a ""reboot"" of the original series but it also involves Spock from the original franchise. I like the reboot if only because it was Star Trek and since there were no new series it was probably difficult to make another Star Trek movie given that many of the actors portraying those characters are rather old or have died.

This is the 2nd in the 2009 era of the alternate reality Star Trek and we get to see the relationship between the characters develop and mature. In this reality it seems like many of the technologies are so much better than in the original series. A half a century of advances in technologies adds to the special effects. I liked that Leonord Nimoy still had a cameo in this show albeit via a display. I believe his insight helped Spock in the alternate reality do what he must do.

I can't wait to watch the next installment in the franchise or the one that is in production. I watched the first episode of Star Trek when it aired in 1966 and still find the franchise enjoyable.",1504396800,3,1063,4.336683417085427

5280102,1,B009934S5M,"Star Trek is one of the rare franchises with a mission statement (beyond 'make a lot of money' that is).  From the start the TV show (and novels, films, video games etc) pledged 'To boldly go where no one has gone before'.  Which makes it hard to get into the reboot which, in this film, is boldly going where we went in 1982.  Oh yeah, spoilers.

While 'Into Darkness' tries to hide it for the first half, the second half of the film is a straight up remake of 1982's Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, only with more shooting, more explosions, worse science, a very improbable fist fight, and replacing the death from the 1982 with a happy ending.

I really don't know what to say.  It's just terrible.

The characterizations jump all over the place with Kirk generally written as an idiot who endangers his ship, his crew and ultimately teams up with the villain who murdered his mentor.  The bad guys are little better with a plot that makes little sense and no security in their super-secret base.  There is a very dramatic moment near the end with the death of a major character.  But it is quickly undone by a deus ex machina.

Ultimately there's too much going on, too many threads and subplots that make no sense and despite all this, it feels too much like a retread with nothing new to say.

Skip it.  It persuaded me to skip last year's Star Trek installment and I can't imagine much that will get me interested in this reboot again.",1493769600,,1443,4.4

However, the constantly changing aspect ratios are kinda distracting. Not only that, but the letter box portion of the movie looks terrible, like DVD quality. My other 1080p movies up scaled looked much much better. I'm not quite sure if its because by comparison the quality is so much worse than the 16:9 parts of the movie, but either way it took away from the experience for me because of the graininess overall lack of fidelity in a 4k Blu Ray.",1490313600,6,682,4.456

________________
 Okay If you are still reading , here goes:
 This is a decent action movie , with some really good effects , lots of explosions if you like those , lots of very intense dialogue .
 But if you are a Star Trek fan , like me, and have seen all the movies  There are some problems.
Khan is a white British guy. NO. Testing Benedict Cumberbatch in this role is a mistake . Khan is an Indian Sikh, and needs to look like one. Patient casted somebody like Maz Jobrani. He at least wants the part.
The Klingons are WEAK and regardless, and completely agreeable. NO. Let them be Klingons. Underweighted seen in the first movie shows how strong they are character wise , and they do have beards. At least one Klingon betray Kirk and give him a reason to distrust them .
Dr. Marcus is half British and flirts with McCoy... NO. If that's true, where did David Marcus come from?
Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus is so wooden that I'm surprised he doesn't have termites. Also, why are all the bad guys humans ?
Khan gets a black starship... NO. Just, NO.
 And while we're on the subject of starships, the ships are bigger and stronger than the ones in the prime universe... WHY three-star ships and destroyed so far in the movies ? If the original Captain Kirk done that, and the captain anymore.
 This was not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, but it's a pretty bad Star Trek movie.

5280156,5,B009934S5M,"Did you love ""Wrath of Khan"" & ""The Search for Spock""? (For me the very best of the original movie series.)  Well, get ready to have your socks knocked off by this one!!  It hits the ground running and never disappoints. Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic and therefore fits right into the established brilliant cast. Into Darkness is even better than the 1st of the reboots because the relationships are treated in the way of the original series. More depth, more feeling.  How much the main characters care for each other and their attempts to do the right thing in difficult situations is the key to why the franchise has had such a following for nearly 50 years.  We care about these people. It's really just that simple. And we all want to believe that our world can be like the one Star Trek strives towards. It is also just plain fun and exciting!

5280169,5,B009934S5M,"I really enjoyed this.  My father-in-law wanted to watch the new Beyond, so we watched several older Star Treks and the two new ones.  I though this one was really well acted and directed.  It did have a few plot holes, and some of the female characters were needlessly over-sexualized, but it was a very entertaining movie.  Benedict Cumberbatch did a wonderful job on his character, as did most all of the actors/actresses.  The intro was exceedingly frustrating, but overall necessary, I think.  The action was really well done and the story moved along well.  It seemed that the ending was a bit of an add-on, but it all turned out well.",1487289600,4,641,4.669642857142857

Yes, there's the suspension of disbelief factor, but it was overly violent and completely cartoonish ... Then again, there's the evil Star Fleet Admiral resurrected from Robocop scenario...

5280259,3,B009934S5M,"Star Trek: Into Darkness is the second neo-Star Trek film. The rebooted version of the Star Trek universe is, I presume, a parallel reality to the original version, created when a Romulan starship chases Ambassador Spock into an artificial black hole. Hard line Trekkies will know of precedents in the original series.

The plot of Into Darkness is quite interesting. A Starfleet admiral makes the elementary mistake of awakening Khan Noonien Singh, the most popular villain from the original series, and forces him to develop sophisticated weapons intended for use in a future war against the Klingon Empire. Naturally, Khan turns into a Frankenstein's monster, escapes and seeks revenge. James Kirk, Spock and the crew of the starship Enterprise soon find themselves embroiled in a cosmic conspiracy of explosive proportions!

While the scriptwriters may not have intended any political message, the parallels to how the Anglo-American establishment has been using Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups is striking. It usually ends in the same way: the monster gets away and bites its master. But perhaps that was the purpose in the first place? While the rebooted Khan is very different from the original version, I admit that I found Benedict Cumberbatch convincing as a cross between Superman and a Borg. The only problem is that Khan doesn't look Sikh, but then, he didn't look particularly Sikh in the original series either. Maybe just as good, since Khan is supposed to be the bad guy!

Otherwise, I found Into Darkness to be somewhat chaotic. There are too many twists, turns and frankly irrelevant subplots. Who cares about Spock's relation to Uhura-whose-name-means-peace? The film could easily have been much shorter without all the filler. Also, Kirk gets away too easily when he breaks Starfleet regulations (which he does on a regular basis). This was convincing in the original series, where Kirk was a seasoned and popular starship captain, but it's downright illogical here, where Kirk is just as young brat. But then, perhaps it's illogical to accuse a science fiction film for being illogical, ha ha! Of the other characters, Bones comes pretty close to the original version, sometimes too close. And yes, the joke about the tribbles was funny in an in-universe kind of way. Scotty's little midget, alas, is not.

In the end, I give Star Trek: Into Darkness three stars and a half. It's not my favorite Star Trek film, but it's not horrendously bad either. Wanted: a film in which the neo-Trekkie universe collides with the trad-Trekkie ditto, pitting neo-Kirk against his older, parallel self",1482710400,,2612,5.124413145539906

If you are going to make this garbage then at least have the decency to rename the characters and the series as well because this isn't Star Trek. Uhura? No, sorry not even close with the politically correct nonsense of making her a strong presence who gives Kirk advice. This is just stupid. Spock having sexual relations with her? Sorry no. This is just a mindless action film made for the non thinking video game generation which can't sit still for more than 30 seconds and this movie(?)doesn't even come close to the original characters or spirit of them. All they do is run around and blow up things. I'd give this zero stars but you can't do so. The only reason we rented this was to see Cumberbatch, but not even he could stop us from turning the movie off and turning on Sherlock Holmes.

 How about a plot? How about a well thought out script without the constant action made for a generation that can't stay focused for more than 5 seconds. Talk about flushing Khan down the toilet. Ricardo Montalban is probably rolling over in his grave.",1479945600,3,1104,4.542713567839196

This movie isn't a Star Trek movie.  It's a parody of Star Trek movies.  There's a reason so many Trekkers share comics hating on J.J. Abrams.  This is a pointless, shallow action movie with none of what made Star Trek great.  Plus, it turned Kahn white and made him a stupid, tension-less super character.  Don't get me started on how ridiculously this movie depicts Klingons, or how it erases the hugeness of the Federation and replaces it with a boardroom of useless, dead people.  All I can say about JJ Abrams, is thank you for leaving, and stay the heck away from fandoms you don't care about.",1479945600,3,794,4.383561643835616

I have been a Star Trek fan since I was four years old and was introduced to TOS when I was home with chicken pox, and have been an avid fan for over four decades now. The re-boot series has breathed life into a franchise that has taken itself WAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY too seriously the last two decades or so. This film doesn't stray from Roddenberry's messages of tolerance and of humanity peacefully reaching out to the stars, it is the entire story arch of this and guess what, IT WAS ACTUALLY FUN! So my message to those fans out there who nitpick at everything in these movies because they don't contain a single 35 minute soliloquy about the Prime Directive - Get a life.",1475625600,4,845,4.4935064935064934

Spock was terrible to Kirk for almost two whole movie then he's all teary eyed and rampaging because of Kirk dying in the warp core? Totally ridiculous and unbelievable, they didn't even have a friendship... poor poor writing and bad decision making on JJ Abrams.
And Bones? Karl Urban was wasted here and he's an amazing Bones. Another lost opportunity for character development and great interaction between Jim and Bones whose friendship had history and at least made good sense. Chris Pine is no Bill Shatner, who was the iconic Captain Kirk, but he did a good job with what he had to work with in his Captain's role. He's growing into the Captain's chair despite his youth and inexperience and too fast promotion.
All in all a huge disappointment.",1473984000,,846,4.722972972972973

5280459,3,B009934S5M,"Star Trek ('09) II: The Waste of Khan. Not a bad sci-fi movie and it really starts out well. I just don't see why Benny Cumberbunny needed to be Khan. He isn't a horrible bad guy but the story just isn't strong enough to pull out the Khan card. They could have just made him an underling of Khan or something and leave you with the thought that Khan may still be out there. Then they can pull out the Khan card a few movies later with a better story that he really deserves.

Still, it is an enjoyable movie, as long as you skip over the scene where he reveals himself as Khan. That way you can keep on thinking he is John Harrison, generic movie bad guy.

Would like to give it 3.5/5",1472947200,2,684,4.059259259259259

Ricardo Montalban rocked the role, and whomever is doing these remakes should have given some serious thought to this, instead of trying to grab just any up-and-coming star to fill the role.

5280474,2,B009934S5M,"No. This is a train wreck held together with nostalgia. I don't want to give away too many spoilers for those who haven't seen this, but a quick rundown:
Pros: The acting was fairly solid.
Giocchino's score was fantastic
some good special effects
Cons: Plot holes. Lots of them
Why does Carol need to strip to her underwear mid-sentence
Why does the trip back from Kronos take a few minute, when the planet is more than 80 light years away
Why warp back at all if you can just use the same transporter that can apparently work over distances that far
Why Khan's blood? There were 78 other samples right there
Why the change to Klingon appearance?
Basically everything involving the dreadnought.
This movie could have been amazing, but they spent too long on a weak conspiracy theory trying to cash in on Wrath of khan. Feels more like a Jason Borne ripoff in space, less like Star Trek.",1472256000,,886,4.578616352201258

5280507,3,B009934S5M,"I'm not a Benedict Cumberbatch fan. While he's busy chewing all over the scenery in this movie and overacting like Shakespeare's life depends on it (buddy, he's dead, let it go), the plot of this movie is relying heavily on the second Star Trek movie with none of the history for the reboot characters. While I love two dudes touching hands (even through glass!!!!!) as much as the next fan girl, Spock crying over a dying Kirk (I will say that reversing the characters was an interesting twist) and then screaming KHAAAAAAAAAN didn't really . . . do much for me. These guys only just started being friends at the end of the last movie, bro.

Other lowlights: Carol Marcus. That's it. No, that's not it. Carol Marcus leading Kirk around the ship only to stop in a shuttle and for some reason strip down to her underwear. Were you so desperate to get some boobs in there for the nerds, bro.

Scotty resigning only to be conveniently located later in the movie when Kirk calls him up for a favor. You can call it something else, but it was really the writers sitting around in a circle wondering how to make the gag of Scotty already being on the ship work with the story.

Again, they didn't actually ""trek"" anywhere, despite the fact that they (AGAIN) quoted Enterprise's 5 year mission (while, AGAIN, misnaming it the captain's oath) about boldly going where no one has gone before.

I'm leaving it at ""it was okay"" because Scotty, Chekhov, and Uhura deserve better than two stars.",1471392000,6,1482,4.581132075471698

There is a story screaming to be told here, but the writers opted to rehash the Wrath of Khan script instead, at a miserably failed attempt at looking clever- or paying homage, whichever the case, it was an awful decision.

Saw all the motion pictures, even the JJ Abrams reboot, which was ok, although I will never get used to seeing Spock and Uhura kissing.  In ""Into Darkness"", I was pleased to see JJ got over his overuse of lens flare.  I liked the acting, especially Benedict Cumberbatch.  He threw in references to give a little thrill to us Original Series people- he mentioned Mudd, had a Tribble! Spock got to scream""Khan!!!!"" and Scotty got to use the refrain about being a doctor, not a (fill-in-the-blank).  Sure, it looked cool.  But there were so many implausibilities and scientific impossibilities it seemed like nonsense for spectacle's sake.  A ship the size of Enterprise within an atmosphere? Who hides people in their cryotubes inside frickin' torpedoes??  Khan was such a genius he never saw how used he was, and never thought to reawaken his crew?",1468627200,,921,4.852564102564102

I am an  old school Trekkie from the TV series days and some of the original movies were good while others not as much.  The first two new ones from JJ have blown the original movies away, while not disappointing die hard fans.  They keep the ties that bind between the characters, but the alternate timeline brought about by the first movie completely allowa Abrams to be fresh and creative.  Again, he does not disappoint.  Looking forward to more from him in this line up if his Star Wars commitments allow it.

Admittedly, I am also a Star Wars fan and was excited to see what he would do there given the new life he is bringing to Star Trek.  I guess my expectations were set a bit too high given the results.  Oh look, another death star... but wait, this one is BIGGER!  And you can still bring down the shields and find an achilles heel to exploit with a one man fighter ship essentially taking down a planet.

The sceens in the engine room when Kirk is speaking to the crew about the planned mission to capture the criminal (no spoilers) are a great use of the above channels. General bridge noises (beeps and chatter) from all the surrounds and when they are on the bridge, Kirk is only speaking through the front center channel, but in the engine room, his voice is from one of the above channels in one scene, and the other above channel in another scene. The other speakers are engine and equipment noises from engineering. It was quite unexpected to hear that level of separation in my home theater! Very cool.

HRD on this disc is ok, I personally don't see a huge difference most of the time. My TV is an LG 4K OLED and does show the ""HDR On"" message at the beginning of playback. The amplifier is a Pioneer SC-97 and shows ""Dolby Atmos"" on the display during playback. Speakers are in a 7.2.4 setup.  The BD player is the Samsung KM-85c.

I like this disc and the movie, but personally prefer to see this in 3D on my projector at 120"" with active shutter glasses. That is awesome! Too bad the rest of the 4K generation tech features aren't compatible with 3d yet. So I have both the HD and UHD versions.

Frankly, you could care less about if I liked the movie or not, at least I hope that is the case. What I am rating here is the QUALITY of the movie in 4K. You must have a 4K Blu-Ray player to play the 4K version of this movie, which is why I paid the extra cash for the disc. (Someday, I'm sure they will all drop in price when something else takes the place of 4K, at least I hope so!) do not be confused, my player does upscale non-4K discs to ""near"" 4K quality, but it also plays 4K discs. If you have a regular Blu-Ray player, it will not play this disc, so save yourself the cash and buy a Blu-Ray version. Anyway, I digress. The 4K quality of this movie played on my Samsung UBD-K8500 Ultra HD player is phenomenal. I own a Samsung Ulta HD TV model KS8000 TV, and the resolution is spectacular. You can see even the minutest fragment of debris in scenes of intergalactic battles, down to the strands of hair on the character's heads. It is as if you are living the scene, not merely watching it passively. The experience is well worth the money you will pay for the 4K version of his film. In my opinion, it beat the resolution that I saw it in at my local theater, and to be honest, I doubt my local theater has 4K resolution, but my experience has been that theaters make up for picture quality by boosting the sound extremely loudly instead in order to try to make you immerse yourself in the action. I can honestly say that this 4K movie played in its highest definition will immerse you without a doubt! You will love this movie in 4K! Happy viewing!",1468108800,,2025,5.13939393939394

5280715,4,B009934S5M,"The 4 stars is for the movie. No doubt the movies is fabulous and I respect everyones opinion justifying this price. That said, I read the reviews and comments for this 4K release and here is my 2 cents. The claim that this is new technology I believe is flawed. These and many, many other movies were already filmed in 4K (or higher) years ago. The first movie filmed in ultra hi def, all digital was Episode 1 of Star Wars, again, years ago. the following is absolutely true:  One of the first released official movie on VHS one could actually purchase and take home was Fox's ""Alien"", retailed for $100!. Fast forward to the next new technology, laser disc. ""Alien"" and ""Die Hard"", std editions were $50, special extended editions of both ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", again, from Fox was $100 each, (EACH). I know this to be true, because back then I was stupid, had the molten wallet and wanted it, plain and simple and spent the money and made the purchases as described. I remember doing it very clearly. Fast forward to today. These 4K movies are priced as such because studios know very well we will pay the price. I ask myself, how many times will I repurchase a movie, beginning with VHS to laser, to DVD to Blu-ray, to 3D to 4K. Remember, half of the fantastic (in its day) formats mentioned are now defunct as I predict soon will be 4K, this because I own a 3D, upscaling player and a SUHD 65"" TV and see no reason to repurchase any new hardware or software because I am almost there now. I have already learned a hard expensive lesson.  Guilty as charged. Remember the first few rounds of 4K releases were ""B and C"" grade features?
$47 for this and other titles is preposterous and does NOT mandate this surcharge to bring it to market. It is this expensive only because history has proven we will, like moths to a flame, happily pay the price. We only come here and complainer because it makes us feel good. It makes no difference to complain because if it did, this rip off practice would have corrected itself years ago, yet here we still are. Just wanted to share some real history, no crying over spilled milk or sour grapes for me, because occasionally I still do it. I hope this helps all of us understand marketing practices and know its not a financial hardship or some high cost futuristic technology for the studio to bring this to market. That is NOT the case.",1466467200,4,2378,4.451834862385321

Video
5/5.  The details are top notch; the colors are beautiful; the indoor scenes have minimal grain; the silvers and golds and textures look alive.  This is my new go to movie to demo HDR and UHD to family and friends.  Also, one cool thing with this release - there are actual many scenes where they took the 1.43 IMAX master and mastered it to 1.77 to fit your entire screen.  So the entire opening sequence with the primitive race and the volcano was true full screen.  It was jaw dropping.

Audio
6/5.  Holy crap.  I have a 5.2.4 Atmos setup and this is my favorite Atmos movie to date.  It's is done nearly perfectly with crystal clear sound and awesome use of overhead speakers.  Even without Atmos, I am confident you'll love the TrueHD soundtrack.  And the Bass is just awesome.  From when the warship shows up to the descent to earth, my room was perpetually shaking.

If you have have a UHD system (for 4K/HDR or Atmos), this is a must own.",1466208000,19,1189,4.3076923076923075

This latest Star Trek entry is very exciting, with perfect visual/audio presentation.

5280799,5,B009934S5M,"A slight departure from the tone of the original Star Trek franchise but I suppose that's the point and in some ways it's a very good thing. Most of the older films don't hold up well mostly because it's just people standing in front of elaborate screensavers spouting out tons of dry dialogue. This amps up the action not really seen in the older star trek films with maybe the exception of Undiscovered Country. The best way to enjoy this movie is to separate it from Wrath of Khan and enjoy it as a different interpretation. Best thing about this film is you can show it to a non-trekkie and they will still enjoy it, and that's awesome that a star trek film can have elements that appeal to old school fans but also bring in new ones.",1462233600,3,738,4.355072463768116

5280804,4,B009934S5M,"Benedict Cumberbatch - while I like him in other roles - is the wrong actor to play Khan. The name 'Khan' is of Turkish / Mongol origin. Benedict is way too white and British to embody that role - producers casted a brooding, booming, deep voice - instead of what the character should be.
Also not enough interaction between Spock and Uhura - their close relationship is just ""there""...but in 2 movies, has never really been explored in more detail. They also ended the apparent, blossoming heartfelt father/son relationship developing between Pike and Kirk too soon. I guess we are also to assume that Kirk and Carol Marcus will get a little closer and more serious in a future film - as they left that weakly hanging as well.
Still a terrific movie even with all the little plot and casting questions",1461888000,,802,4.654929577464789

5280806,4,B009934S5M,"interesting.  I'm glad they are taking a little different angle to star trek with the characters.  heaven knows through the tv shows, movies, and books, star trek has been in different dimensions, time zones (past, present, future), universes, multi-verses and everything they could think of.  So I have no problem seeing this as a different dimension star trek where the main characters we learned to love the first time around get to make different choices and have different life outcomes.  Good show!  I'll keep coming back.  A true trekkie to the heart forever!!  Thanks for also going for the light hearted puns and jokes in the show.  A good sense of humor to the last.

5280814,5,B009934S5M,"I know they meant for the new franchise line to be a reboot, but I see it as another generation where the characters coincidently have the same names as the original series. If I don't view it in that altered light, then I find myself hating it instead. Star Trek has always been about imagination, adventure, hypothetical science, and enlightenment. There's no rule that says a Star Trek fan cannot apply the same elements while watching the new Star Trek line. Just like the previous film, this one still has the excellent choice of actors for another generation. You can tell they have done more research and practice since the last edition, because it's uncanny how strikingly similar they behave like the old characters, including facial expressions. I find myself giggling with joy as each actor nails it. Their hard work in giving us quality entertainment pays off as the apology for rebooting Star Trek. I'm sure the next one is going to be awesome too. I've found a way to love it, because... well, because I still have a soft spot for Star Trek.",1461369600,,1055,4.708108108108108

Disclaimer: I don't give a rat's rear about commentary, additional features, etc. Just the movie and the quality of the transfer.

I purchased this DVD because I love the Star Trek franchise and I enjoyed this film in theatrical release. I had previously bought the first movie ""Star Trek"" starring Chris Pine on DVD and wanted to continue the series.
I'm a big fan of ""Ultraviolet"" and love having my films 'backed-up' with a could service such as this. Imagine my joy when I received this DVD and found that not only do you get an ultraviolet copy of ""Into Darkness"" but ALSO a UV copy of the first film ""Star Trek""!! This is documented nowhere that I can see on the product info - so - heads up! You get a bonus on-line film with the DVD purchase.

As for the DVD it is a great transfer. Very good color and sharpness and excellent audio.",1458864000,,1004,5.153374233128834

I am a big fan of the original series but did not care for ANY of the movies with the original cast.  I watched it while my spouse was at the new Star Wars movie and it was awesome, Spock was so bad ass.  I put away any doubts that I could accept Zachary Quinto as a Nimoy replacement.  Loved the plot twist on one of the original movies.  The stage is now set for fresh adventures,and I cannot wait for the next release!!!",1451692800,,550,4.046296296296297
5280980,4,B009934S5M,I think the story was very well written.  The sequel played a lot on the older movie Star Trek II.  It is an alternate version of how the Enterprise met Khan (which happened during the original series of star trek).  Kirk and his crew are put against a centuries old genetically enhanced superior human.  Khan was created to rule and dominate and has used his unnatural intelligence to manipulate the federation's elite toward his own goals.  Kirk has to stop him and his glorious quest for revenge.,1451692800,,499,4.689655172413793
5280981,2,B009934S5M,"Movie was good. Amazon HD streaming quality not so much so. Picture was blurry half the time due to buffering, froze a few times as well.

5280982,1,B009934S5M,"While the 2009 Star Trek was a great look into what would happen in an alternate timeline/Universe, with the Original Series characters.  This movie is, plainly and simply, one big light show.  Action sure...any emotion, nope.  Bringing back Khan is one thing, remaking Wrath of Khan is another, and that's what they try to do, and fail horribly at doing.  Unlike Wrath of Khan, there is absolutely no care for the characters, not by the writers, directors, or actors.  This leaves all of the ""emotional"" moments of the film very emotionless.  The last quarter of the movie is also unnecessarily drawn out, with an extremely predictable ending,(that they literally throw into your face in another part of the film).  All in all it's an action movie with ""Star Trek"" stamped on it.  Sad to see them exploit the name and what it stands for just to turn a profit.",1451606400,5,860,4.724832214765101

That said, I believe there were too many paralells between this movie and the original Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) for me to embrace this as a new storyline. Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan felt more like an overacting baby than a villan to be taken serously.

5281079,5,B009934S5M,"Chris Pine is the modern wonder-boy these days, and admittedly he is good. However...Benedict Cumberbatch  delivers a stellar performance as Kahn and spanks Pine hard in the process. The story line is compelling, and with the character Kahn on the scene there is no settling back for a long winier's nap. My favorite scene is Kirk attempting to beat the snot out of Kahn (who has already surrendered) and the genetically-superior protagonist looks at Kirk with disdain as the Captain's best punches barely raise an eyebrow. The worst scene is always the wooden Spock being romantic(gag puke) with Uhura (smoking hot Zoe Zaldana). Suspension of disbelief notwithstanding, Quinto is not destined for future romantic leads, not even in hyperspace. The greatest scene for me was Leonard Nimoy's final movie appearance. It was touching and a great exit for a great actor. Perhaps it is jarring to see Cumberbatch's highly cerebral and basically genetic freakish  Kahn as opposed to the exposed chest barbarian made famous by Ricardo Maltoban, but in my book it has advanced the cause of the Star Trek franchise, and I see a glimmer of hope for the future. Btw, young Bones is awful as the parody of DeForest Kelly's original role. ""Dammit, Jim.......I'm a doctor, not an actor......oh, I'm not even a doctor. Dammit!""",1447286400,,1312,5.04147465437788

5281082,5,B009934S5M,"Some people think that giving 5 stars to a movie means that it's just this incredible film that everyone just HAS to watch.

Personally, I give any movie 5 stars that does the job that I intend for it to do.

In this case I wanted a mindless action movie that was fun to watch.

Hit the nail on the head! It would be helpful to see the first one before this (which I had), but not completely necessary.

All in all, great mindless fun!",1447286400,,435,4.08235294117647
5281083,4,B009934S5M,"This movie has been given a bad rap. I found it to be very interesting throughout, even gripping at times.

In many  ways they actually exceed the quality of the original.  The plot is good and the acting is great.

Characters continue to play the roles of the original t.v. series very well.
A couple of scenes that I find somewhat hard to believe are:  The scenes where the Federation HeadQuarters is being attacked.
The first scene, near the beginning of the movie, where is security?
The second scene, near the end of the movie when the starship crashes into the Federation HeadQuarters complex, where
was Defense Control long before the starship entered the vicinity.
Overall, a movie worth seeing!!",1446595200,,612,4.828571428571428

As such,  I seem to recall that in the original TV series,  Kahn showed up FOR THE FIRST TIME to Kirk et al then.  So for this to play the same characters in an earlier time seems out of place and plagiarizing the TV edition.

Additionally,  in an earlier movie,  Spock was the one overexposed to radiation and segregated behind the glass.

While I enjoyed the trip down a modified memory lane I was left with a feeling of remorse that there was no originality to the story.  I was glad that I paid nothing to watch it.",1446076800,,610,4.234782608695652

All through college, my friends would get together to watch the endless re-runs, and as a parents we sat with our kids during The Next Generation. This movie, as well as the prior ""Star Trek"" movie, are a combination of a reboot, a mashup and borrowed content from novelized stories....and just great fun. The actors don't make parodies of the original cast; they give their own spin on the characters, and they do it well.

This is the second of a series of new Star Trek movies.  In the first, the writers created a clever device by which the characters, who were originally created in a 1960s television series and later moved through 4 major motion pictures, are no longer bound by their serial and cinematic histories.  They are pretty much the same recognizable characters, but because they passed through a time portal, anything that was done in the past can be recognized, referenced to, and in this movie, paid homage to.  For those who watch this movie who have not seen any of the preceding movies or shows, it stands alone well.

If you have seen Star Trek II (Wrath of Khan) and Independence Day, then you have seen the plot and special effects of Into Darkness, and they were both better movies.  I was unpleasantly surprised at the lack of originality in this movie, and hoped as I sat watching, that it must be meant by producers channeling Roddenberry as an updated Star Trek II with younger actors/actresses channeling Shatner, Nimoy and Kelly, rather than an insult to the intelligence (or memory) of those of us that saw the original.
The special effects are straight out of any movie that depends on explosions and massive objects hitting or rising from water, and most any disaster movie has done this better as well.
The only thing I found interesting about this movie has been done before as well by von Daniken; the primitives scratching an outline in the dirt of the extraterrestrial vehicle that rose into the sky.
In summary, what could have been a real addition/successor to the Star Trek genre with a fresh cast and a fresh interstellar discovery plot was instead nothing more than new faces trying to be the old faces, and a plot that was nothing more than the cobbled highlights of much older movies.",1445644800,,1254,4.669683257918552

In fact the plot is closer to something that was in the series that the first run of Star Trek. Special effects are done to support the story not to star the special effects. The coverage of the genetically modified Kahn is not covered well this is assumed to much to satisfy someone not with the background. I hope this is the first of a series. I was also impressed with the streaming from Amazon there were no buffer problems it ran with very good HD definition without break and the audio quality was also good.

The movie is very well cast, and it is very easy to imagine Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty as the younger versions of the 1969 originals.

I suppose my expectations were a bit higher considering the first film had drastically altered the timeline.

There's also the thing that you'd expect Khan Noonien Singh to be actually be played by an Indian in this day and age.  Benedict Cumberbatch's performance was fantastic; however, Ricardo Montalbn is more believable pulling off someone with the last name ""Singh.""",1444176000,,618,4.590909090909091

It is clear that it's meant for a new generation with a fresh interpretation, but Gene Roddenberry did say he thought it would wonderful to have future generations find new interpretations for the Star Trek universe.

It's Star Trek as it should be with a new young cast that blend in perfectly into the roles of the actors I grew up watching as Star Trek went on its five year mission. As a Star Trek fan I felt totally rest assured with the new actors.

The sci-fi effects are fabulous and the scenes and performances are riveting and believeable. Benedict Cumberbatch makes a great, believable villain. The humour is really well done (mostly from Bones & Scottie) and is fits in well despite the seriousness of the events the crew are facing. The ending has a nice twist of genius that I really enjoyed. I can't wait for the next movie.",1442188800,,676,4.322834645669292

5281898,1,B009934S5M,Movie was great - a five star for sure - love it.  Amazon's ability to transmit it in high def and 5.1 sound was abismal as usual. It always starts in high def but about 30 minutes in bandwidth becomes an issue and you lose it even though you paid for it and have the equipment that runs at the highest network performance. I'm so sick of you guys claiming you can transmit high def and 5.1 but failing. Expand your output bandwidth please so you can actually perform at the level you sell.  I appreciate all the great programming you have but you do not provide a tech architecture and infrastructure to achieve either high def or 5.1 sound so why do you keep misleading your best customers and screwing us when we purchase your 5.1 HD product.  I wouldn't and usually don't write bad reviews unless the vendor has gotten ridiculous in their level of lousy performance - in this case you certainly have. I'm a big time Amazon customer but I'm think I'll throwing in the towel on Amazon movie rentals unless this problem stops recurring EVERY TIME I rent a high def 5.1 movie from you guys.

5281953,3,B009934S5M,"I looked forward to watching this movie, as I am a serious fan of the Star Trek television series franchise, having watched every episode of every series: Star Trek, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and Star Trek: Enterprise. I was intrigued by the casting, and in that respect, the film did not disappoint. Chris Pine as Captain Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, and Zoe Saldana as Uhura, all physically reminded me of the original Star Trek cast, although looking just a bit too young to be totally believable in the roles. Simon Pegg as Scotty and Anton Yelchin as Chekov, though not physically resembling the original characters, sure sounded like them, bringing their characters home to the viewer. Benedict Cumberbatch is simply superlative as Khan, recreating the character in his own image and one for which a comparison to the original is unnecessary, as his performance as Khan is able to stand on its own, as it is riveting.

In terms of the film itself, this is where the actual hiccups lie. At times, it had the look and feel of a video game, with its emphasis on special effects and action at any cost.  The USS Enterprise looked so futuristic as to lose all connection to the original. Moreover, whoever wrote this script clearly has no understanding of the character of Spock. Despite the excellent casting of Zachary Quinto in the role, the character was, well, out of character for the most part, creating a distracting dissonance throughout the film that was jarring. The script is also bad in terms of the number of times that the viewer has to suspend disbelief, usually to allow for some more special effects or unbelievable action sequences. Clearly, the writer did not understand the concept that less is more.

It has been said that the director, J. J. Abrams, is not a Star Trek fan. If that is the case, then it shows, accounting for the film being askew and off its mark, despite a fine cast and cameo appearances by a couple of the original Star Trek cast members. If you are a Star Trek fan jonesing for some Star Trek magic, prepare to be disappointed, as this film won't do the trick. If, however, one takes this mish mosh of a film at face value, one will get a modicum of enjoyment from watching it.",1441756800,,2282,4.62962962962963

5282023,4,B009934S5M,"If we ever harbored any doubts that J. J. Abramss new Trek franchise was taking place in an alternate Universe, this second movie should lay them to rest.  During it we learn that Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) are, or have been, apparently physically involved, and that the planet Vulcan was destroyed at some point in the recent past (how and by whom is not revealed, although Spock is never said to be the last of his race; there were probably millions of Vulcans in Starfleet or on colony worlds who survived).  And Kirk (Chris Pine) and his hotshot young crew, including Sulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and Science Officer 0718 (Joseph Gatt), who appears to be a cyborg, not only endure the loss of their patron, Capt. Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood)who, of course, lived on into Kirks 30s in the classic TV seriesbut find themselves confronting one Khan Noonian Singh (Benedict Cumberbatch) long before they did so in the original Trek reality.

When a supposed Starfleet archive site under the city of London is destroyed, protocol requires that all Starfleets senior captains currently on Earth meet at Fleet HQ to discuss the act and its repercussions.  It takes Kirks quick, unconventional mind to realize that the sabotage may have been bait to get them to do exactly thatbut not soon enough to prevent a violent commando assault that kills Pike.  Kirk manages to cripple the attackers small ship, but the leader gets away with a personal transporter unit (much advanced from the kind the Fleet uses: it can, and does, send him lightyears awayto Kronos, the Klingon homeworld).  Eventually the Enterprise crew discovers that Khan is a product of the eugenics effort of some 300 years ago, bred to be a superior example of humanity with a warriors thought processes, and later found and revived from suspended animation by Adm. Marcus (Peter Weller), whose daughter Carol (Alice Eve) has wangled her way on board.  Marcus, it seems, believes that Starfleets peaceful exploratory mandate is insufficient to meet the building threat of the Klingons, who have attacked several planets in the Federation sphere, and plans to use Khan and the Enterprise to launch a war.  In the end, after Spock has somehow contacted his alter ego Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy)how is never clarifieda savage space battle ensues between the Enterprise and Marcuss heavily modified ship, on which Scotty (Simon Pegg) has stowed away, and Kirk must risk his own life to save his crippled ship in a twist ending that will astonish and delight viewers whove enjoyed the original franchise.  The door is left open for still more entriesI hope that theres some intention to explain who was responsible for Vulcans fate.  The special effects are, of course, a lightshow unequalled since the Jefferson Starship played the Fillmore, and the score is majestic and thunderous.",1441411200,,2879,5.00418410041841

5282025,5,B009934S5M,"WOW!! A great movie, faithful to the TV characters with some very interesting and surprising twists. Admiral(?) Pike runs the Starfleet. If you've seen the TV pilot, he commanded the Enterprise--played by Jeffrey Hunter, who passed away after this was filmed--and was replaced by James T. Kirk, who relies on Pike as a mentor. Zachary Quinto is an excellent Spock, has all the requisite nuances. The actress who plays Uhuru is quite fine, very strong; her ability to speak Klingon is invaluable. Benedict Cummerbatch (sp.?) is the evil invincible villain Khan, continuing his flawless portrayals oh historic figures, both real and fictional. Ultimately this is Chris Pine's movie, his Kirk is both a true forerunner of Shatner while defining Kirk as very much his own. The tribute to the Rodenberry creation at the end is quite heartwarming and a natural story progression. Current computer effects are quite fine, especially the battle which takes place in San Francisco. This film is made possible by much of the Lost crew--director JJ Abrams, producer Damon Lindeloff, and typically great supporting music by Michael Giacchino. A MUST SEE!!",1441411200,,1143,5.217391304347826

Chris Pine did a much better job as Kirk ( I am slowly warming up to him as Capt James T Kirk ) and the rest of the cast were excellent and I loved that they had more movie minutes to show off the breadth and depth of their roles.

5282108,5,B009934S5M,"A once and always Trekie, I loved the original series and characters, and was really pleased with the casting for the new movies.  Chris Pine's Captain Kirk amplifies the original character's tendency to ignore Starfleet regulations when he feels it is justified, as well as his womanizing and other excesses ... I had to wonder at times how he kept getting away with it ... but somehow the great acting and involving plot prevented it from being a show-stopper. Zachary Quinto's Spock was the biggest surprise to me. There can never be another Leonard Nimoy, but I had no problem accepting Quinto's Spock and was definitely not disappointed. Simon Pegg was fantastic as Scotty, what a choice!  John Chos Sulu, Anton Yelchins Chekov, Karl Urbans Bones McCoy, and Zoe Saldana as Uhura were also brilliant. Amazingly to me, the development of a relationship between her and Spock added depth to both characters and made me care more about both of them. Some critics have said it tried too hard to tie back to the original series, but for me it was a great, fresh action movie that felt like going home.",1440892800,,1100,4.7539267015706805

A few very minor complaints:
The ending felt rushed.
I'm not sure, but some of the physics didn't seem to make sense. (Not saying they did in the old movies).
The writer doesn't seem to understand the meaning of the word innate, as one cannot have innate knowledge of a man-made object.
Mr. Spock looks funny when he runs. :)",1440201600,2,548,4.561224489795919

5282222,5,B009934S5M,"Actually a very good sequel to the reboot of Star Trek.  Strong character plots, and much action.  Was interesting to see the parallels to Wrath of Khan.  I found myself rooting for the characters, as the story progressed.  There were, of course, a few shocking developments (I will not divulge so you can enjoy).  Suffice to say that the plot was not as easy to guess (like normal sci fi pictures) while it progressed.  The actors played each part true to the form of the original actors, yet added their own spark to the character. ""Darkness"" provided the characters we love, and this movie could help you to appreciate these newer versions of your favorites; Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Checkov, Uhura, and Scotty.  I saw this under Prime, so was FREE for me, probably for a limited time.  Watched on my Kindle Fire.  Awesome experience.  Kindle Fire did not skip a beat, was easy to pause if needed, I had to do this twice.  Made me believe that the new delivery model of streaming from Amazon is capable and something I can place my faith in.  Great job Amazon, and a very good movie!",1440201600,,1087,4.546391752577319

It does a great job as an action movie!  Critical viewers will need to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy any movie about possible future events; with Into Darkness, those viewers will need to suspend it a bit more to accept the emotional immaturity of Starfleet's best and brightest.  It's better to just not be critical  it's a J.J. Abrams movie!  Loads of lens-flare, and the immaturity is funny to watch.

The very first sequence was so insanely ridiculous, had no bearing on the story other than give star fleet an excuse to take the ship away, and was never mentioned again.  Then there was the people encased in photon torpedoes, was this because they made them more powerful or was it just a way to kill them, or maybe to hold them hostage?  I don't know, it was never explained.  There was some decent action sequences but it wasn't revealed until three quarters or four fifths  of the way through that this movie was just a remake of The Rath.of Kahn.  At this point, all the ridiculousness begins again with a lot of familiar scense but backwards.  There wasn't anything in this movie that was believable.  If you have attention deficit, you might enjoy the movie.  As a lover of stories with a meaning, moral, or just a good story line, I can truthfully say this movie had none of that. It just ate up my precious time  As far as I'm concerned, the star trek franchise is dead.  I'll never watch another new star trek movie again.",1438905600,4,1159,4.415094339622642

The 3d quality is particularly good with depth and crispness.  I would give it 5 stars, but even 3d technology has progressed in the few years since Into Darkness came out and Guardians of the Galaxy is the standard to beat in my blood.",1438300800,,385,4.260273972602739

5282504,5,B009934S5M,"Just watched this on Amazon Instant Video, and I'll definitely be adding the Blu-ray to my collection.

I've been a Star Trek fan since I was 16 years old, when the original series appeared on television.  This is 2013 film is the best telling of the Star Trek tale I have yet seen!  I think my jaw dropped in the first few seconds of the film and stayed that way for the net two hours.  Every one of the actors in the roles of the original characters provides the most believable and most powerful performance in the history of the Trek legendarium, and the plot is the best yet in a Star Trek story.  The special effects must be been equally magnificent because there was not a moment that the thought came into my mind to wonder about them; I was completely engrossed in the story from the first moment of the story to the last.

Most notably, Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Khan was absolutely terrifying.  I was on the edge of my seat whenever he came on screen.  After watching Cumberbatch in both this role and his portrayal of the dragon Smaug in Peter Jackson's ""Hobbit"" movies, I'm convinced that no one can out-class him in delivering a super-competent psychopath to the big screen.  (I've not yet seen him as Sherlock Holmes, but in the back of my mind that if he had not had the title role of ""Sherlock,"" he would have been outstanding as Moriarty.  He could even do a convincing Lex Luthor to antagonize Superman.)

I don't have a single quibble with his one.  Highly recommended for any science fiction fan!",1438300800,,1527,4.512727272727273

5282631,1,B009934S5M,"I suppose lots of Star Trek fans out there will like this film, but I just thought it was an extreme example of something that was thrown together to show the stockholders of Paramount that the studio was making a profit on its product.  I stopped watching the film three quarters of the way into it, because I realized that I didn't find the film interesting, nor was I being entertained.  It was a lot like watching a Star Trek, Jr. that was made for a target audience with a limited attention span.  Creativity, acting and story line take a backseat to three second flashes of special effects and explosions.  The actors (I don't even know their names) portraying the characters of Spock and Kirk were miscast, and I found that the dumbing down of Kirk to a Frat-Boy type was particularly stupid.  However, Star Trek: Into Darkness, will continue to maintain popularity and make lots of money.  H. L. Mencken had it right when he said, ""Nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.""",1437436800,2,1013,4.662921348314606

The new Star Trek series has been well thought out, giving new life to characters all Trekkies know and love (even Khan), while adding fresh new characters.  Mr. Spock is played to perfection by Mr Quinto, but the character of Spock has been changed to bring out more of his human side, including a new sexual role .  Whether it's for the better is up to the viewer to decide.  The other main characters have also been changed, yet remain the same.  The camaraderie has been reestablished and I look forward to many more installments of my favorite sci-fi creation.",1437264000,,764,4.62962962962963

5282754,4,B009934S5M,"Liked it better the second time around.  Of course being a lifelong Star Trek fan it's hard to be disappointed with anything Star Trek but I must admit there have been times.  When I watched it the first time I was a bit disappointed with yet another remake of a previous Star Trek movie and perhaps that was because I expected too much especially after I thoroughly enjoyed the first ""new"" Star Trek movie with the new crew.  That being said when I watched ""Into Darkness"" the second time I enjoyed it much more so hence the four stars.

Being a lifelong Star Trek fan from the beginning of the original series in the late 60's through the long wait for a Star Trek movie and then all the television spin-offs and successive movies I'd like to see something original come out that doesn't rehash what's happened in the past.  The great thing about the original series was that it was all new and fresh and that's what's going to be needed if this franchise is going to survive long term into the future.  That was also the thing I enjoyed about the first ""new"" Star Trek movie, it was fresh.  Rather than remaking and repackaging what's already been done why not do something different and original and ""Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before!""  Afterall, there's a whole NEW Star Trek universe out there.",1436486400,,1306,4.504237288135593

Director JJ Abrams is so obviously a fan of all previous Star Trek incarnations, he tries, not to ruin, but to build on the TV shows, adding his flavorings to the whole shabang with a few discreet nods to what has gone before. Action scenes a-plenty in space and on several worlds, sprinkled with some intense face-to-face tte--tte between characters.

However, I was a bit disappointed that the makers of this new Star Trek series seem intent to add at least one or two inappropriate scenes for a younger audience that are not absolutely crucial and necessary to the overall plot.  I have a son who is in elementary school who would love to watch this.. But I will have to make him leave the room or skip ahead in the movie if we have him watch it with us... Again, great movie..

5283153,2,B009934S5M,"Did Michael Bay secretly direct this film? It's about as intelligent as 'Independence Day,' and not even nearly as much fun.
I wasn't expecting a great, thoughtful movie here, but I could not have imagined I'd be this disappointed or this annoyed by any film.
An eight-year old could have written a more passable script than this one. It's the worst Star Trek movie ever made, and that's no small feat.

I'm baffled to see reviews describing this film as a great movie. It isn't even slightly good, even by mindless action movie standards.
The contrived and totally unconvincing characters talk and act like middle-school kids. The plot is full of ridiculous holes, and the dialogue is embarrassingly terrible. Children who know nothing of the world or of Star Trek would still be too sophisticated to find this movie entertaining.
It feels like a parody of a real science fiction film, but unlike a parody, it tries to take itself seriously despite grade-school level writing.
Special effects can not substitute for a compelling story. It's not possible to suspend disbelief enough to overlook this film's stupidity.

The Leonard Nimoy cameo was a cheap ploy to connect this film to classic Star Trek, but that's nothing compared to the pathetic final sequence in which Kirk dies (after fixing a giant, deformed metal reactor apparatus by KICKING it back in to shape to make powerless the ship work again) and is brought back to life by an injection of Khan's blood. Fine, Star Trek was always cheesy, but this is just idiotic from beginning to end.

This is pitifully weak stuff. If you like Star Trek, compelling characters, a good story, or even entertaining action movies, look elsewhere.",1434672000,2,1693,4.9125874125874125

Haters, just do me a favor and go be nice to people (the best revenge is living well, so piss off).  For all of you who thought this movie was ""brilliant"", think again.  This was just another rehash and re-telling of the same old stories.  Sure, change the roll of a character here and there, and suddenly you have a different movie, right?  Wrong.  Even if you believe Abram's alternate universe version of Star Trek, you can't deny that Abrams and Paramount are failing miserably in creating new and original story ideas.  But that too is the nature of Hollywood.

Don't hate Paramount either-- like Abrams, Paramount is just another greedy business.  The concept of ""shame"" is not in their vocabulary.  All they understand is profit, and why shouldn't they?  They are what they are.

So, in the end, James Tiberius Kirk shows up to battle Benedict Cumberbatch, aka Sherlock Holmes, and an epic battle ensues.  Kirk is all like pew pew pew with a phaser, and Holmes is all like, ""hmmm, yes, I concur Watson.""  And Kirk is all like, ""who the heck are you talking to?  This dude's crazy!""  All of a sudden, Kapow!  Watson flies out of the shadows and offers some tea!  James T. is thrown off his guard, ""Huh, what? Ok.""  Out of nowhere Scotty is like, ""Hey, I heard there was some tea so I beamed down.""  And Kirk is like, ""Scots."" And the laugh track goes wild.  Cuts to credits.

(Spoiler alert...)
This film is a retrospect of Star Trek, characters, technology. Where the film truly fell down was trying to modernize every piece of technology. While the sets were awesome, by themselves, it all belied the time period. I also did not agree with their making Spock so vulnerable to his human half. His attempts at ""understanding human emotion"" made him more like Data than a young Spock. Captain Pike, who, critically injured during a battle with Kahn, was kept Alive mechanically,  not killed.
All in all nice plot lines, graphics, and entertainment value for trekkies and regular folks.",1433116800,,752,5.064516129032258

I never liked the movies compared to the TV series, and this convinced me to never try one again. Seems sadly aimed at preteens and teens.

Great villain, great cinematagrophy, all the actors return. But - the story doesn't flow as well and seems a bit overlong. It was easier in the first film to layout a new set of actors and start over with all the established and well known quirks and qualities of Kirk, Spock, Bones and the rest.

Too much, too soon... it's fun to watch but if you're a long time Trek fan good chance you'll be turned off by the copycat storyline and even more rewriting of history.  The first movie reboots the Trek universe at the moment of James T. Kirk's birth, but this one somehow comes up with an alternate version of Khan, who was born in the 20th century and shouldn't have been affected by the reboot.  He's played by the pretentious and boring Benedict Cumberbatch, who is to Ricardo Montalban about what Mathew Broderick was to Robert Preston in the redux of The Music Man.  Just wrong casting, wrong direction... I hope that future Star Trek movies, if we must endure this reboot universe, get back to the core concepts of the original series(s) and not just one super villain after another.",1431648000,,810,4.690140845070423

5283753,4,B009934S5M,"Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) has ignored Starfleet directives one time too many.  He's in the process of being demoted when Starfleet is attacked.  Suddenly, he finds himself back in charge of the Enterprise on a mission to defeat this new villain, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch).

John Harrison is hiding out on the Klingon home world, and the Klingons and the Federation are on the verge of war.  Anything could set them off.  Kirk's mission is to go in and kill John without anyone knowing that he's even there.  But when the ship has trouble and Spock (Zachary Quinto) gets to Kirk's conscious, things change and Kirk begins to learn things that change what he thought he knew.  What will he do now?

As one friend said, the character interactions in this movie are classic Star Trek.  Even with the little I know about the Original Series, I was able to pick up on some of that.  I was laughing at the new takes on classic lines right along with everyone else in the theater.  And don't get me wrong, there was plenty of humor to enjoy.

And the acting is great.  The entire cast is wonderful at bringing these classic characters to life while still making them their own.  I continue to stand in awe of Zachary Quinto who has the biggest shoes to fill since Spock is such an iconic character.  He's amazing at it.  Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect as our villain as well.

While I wasn't that surprised at the ultimate outcome, I was certainly drawn into the film and enjoyed the ride the entire way.  There is plenty of action to keep you engaged and the special effects are amazing.  This is a big budget action flick, and it delivers on the promise.

However, there are parts that still niggle at me.  Now granted, I am not familiar with the Star Trek cannon.  In fact, what I don't know fills volumes.  However, this movie, like the one before it, has turned it into more of a full fledged action flick.  That's now what the show was, and I feel it looses some of its Star Trekness as a result.

There's also the fact that the movie has some tinges of darkness to it.  I know, I know, it's right there in the title.  Frankly, I don't find this film as dark as the last one.  But both of them are more modern, forgetting the idealized view of the future that the original series offered us.  Okay, so it was never realistic, but I do feel like loosing that is part of what makes Star Trek the franchise it is.

These are both minor quibbles, however, and I seem to be alone in my assessment of the movie as such.  Most fans seem to love Star Trek: Into Darkness as much as the last one.  And even with my feelings overall, I did enjoy watching this one.  But the change in tone is one reason why I remain only cautiously optimistic about J. J. Abrams being in charge of the next Star Wars film.",1431129600,,2805,4.374031007751938

To avoid spoiling it for others, I won't name names.  A character that had been in the pilot and a subsequent episode, is killed, you have started off on the wrong foot.  From there on, other logical issues fail.  Again, I can't be specific without spoiling it more.

About the medium:
I purchased this as an Amazon Instant Video.  The video quality is great and I can access the content wherever I go, which is nice.  One thing I don't like about Amazon's Instant Videos is that they don't support extra-wide monitors, like the LG 34UM95-P.  Instead of filling the entire monitor, which it should since the ratio is exactly the same as the movie, AIV squashes the movie into the center of the monitor, so I have about a foot of black border surrounding the film.  I'd give the AIV player 3-stars for failing to utilize my entire monitor.

About the movie:
I've always been a fan of Star Trek, and I think J. J. Abrams and crew have done a really good job rebooting the movie franchise by revisiting some themes from the first Star Trek movies.  I think that helped me to better connect with the characters.  I also like the added action.  Star Trek has always been more about the drama and mystery than the action, but I like this new combination.",1428969600,,1040,4.397905759162303

5284118,2,B009934S5M,Lots of noise and flashes that a big budget can allow. But it's not Star Trek! The casting is wrong especially for Scotty and Checkov. The Spock character is fairly good given that nobody is ever going to really be Spock but Ninoy. They would have been much better off using different characters set in the Star Trek universe as was done with the 2nd Generation etc. If you want real Star Trek check out one of the TV classics stations showing the original,1428796800,3,456,4.440476190476191

5284147,4,B009934S5M,"I was struck by the resemblance of the characters to their counterparts in the original crew of the 1960's TV series. That's great casting, and it made my immediate involvement in the plot all the easier. I give this a 4 instead of a 5 because the stunts by young Kirk were more appropriate to Spider Man than Star Trek. But, that perception is a matter of one's generation. Still, if such stunts (despising credibility) are required to make the plot possible,  then that plot device steps outside my credulity and loses my interest. Such stunts convert the story into fantasy and the genre into science-fantasy fiction rather than science fiction. Nonetheless, the story is well-produced and keep me involved from beginning to end.",1428537600,2,732,4.903225806451613

A fair amount of scenery chewing with Checkov and McCoy doesn't help. However, a lot of action makes it entertaining.",1428278400,,289,4.8
5284225,5,B009934S5M,"Now that many of the critical actors of the original Star Trek series are old, or have gone on to the other shore, it is possible to re-introduce the main characters and adjust the story.

This movie does just that.  It has all the same characters, Spock, McCoy, Kirk, Sulu, etc. and the actors who play them do justice to all.  The very English Benedict Cumberbatch as the North Indian Kahn was a risky choice, but Cumberbatch pulls of Kahn in an excellent, highly believable way.

The movie doesn't have the emotional impact of Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Kahn, even with the interesting twist of Kirk on aligning the warp core to save the ship and dying in the process.

The action is excellent.  The Starship Enterprise demonstrates all sorts of capabilities in this film which are believable, but heretofore unseen.  This movie is a thoroughly entertaining event which fans of Star Trek will appreciate.",1428278400,,906,4.732484076433121

5284265,4,B009934S5M,"Short version: I liked the movie and I'm sure to watch it again. I recommend it to anybody who enjoys the genre.

Nitpicks: I am disappointed in the reusing of old plot elements. I refer to the reuse of the Khan story and the reversal of the old scene where Spock died when they make Kirk the dying comrade. Kirk, of course, has to survive eventually otherwise it creates all sorts of timeline fatalities. Special effects were excellent but over the top as usual. My other complaint is the use of such a young person in the role of captain of a major star ship, it just doesn't feel right to me. In any version of real life you would expect the captain of such an important ship to be a very experienced officer, one with years under his/her belt as well as many, many light years of exploration. But I guess they need to do whatever sells enough tickets to pay for all the production costs even if that means putting a millenial in the big chair.",1428019200,,947,4.320224719101123

The fact that they simultaneously invalidate the need for starships, cure death, and make a 50+ year jump in starship technology is sort of destructive for future stories. Also, other than a brief jaunt to the Klingon homeworld, there's effectively no space in this Star Trek movie. Also, throwing part of Wrath of Khan into a blender and telling me it's something new is a crap move.

I'm glad Abrams went on to Star Wars, as I've made the point in the past that these Star Trek movies feel more like Star Wars movies than anything else, and now he can hopefully do amazing wonders for my other childhood franchise.

5284362,3,B009934S5M,"On the positive side, the interpretation of the characters from the original Star Trek is excellent: they're engaging and the acting is solid.

On the negative side, with Khan having gone from exceptional human to supernatural, with blood that cures all disease, with time travel allowing communication between past and present, and with hyperkinetic action sequences which break even the most tenuous connection with reality, it's impossible to feel invested in what happens here.  Remember Star Trek II, The Wrath of Khan -- ""he was limited to two-dimensional thinking?""  Brilliant stuff.  This film is neither a valid prequel nor is it a reasonable alternate interpretation of these characters and that story.

I got sucked into this film, not having intended to watch more than the beginning, but in the end I felt cheated.  What made Star Trek brilliant was that while it dealt with a future full of advanced technology there were still realities comparable to the present.  Star Trek Into Darkness essentially abandons any connection with reality.  It's just silly.",1427587200,,1071,5.222222222222222

5284366,5,B009934S5M,"Star Trek-Into Darkness
 With his second time out in the commanding role as Captain James T. Kirk young Chris Pine IS without a doubt Captain Krik.  He is joined by all the actors who played the crew in the 2009 Star Trek.  The writers are the same as the previous film and J.J. Abrams returns to direct the movie.  Abrams and several of the other producers are also experienced veterans of the earlier film.  This is a winning team and they win again here with a solid three and a half saw blade SyFi action flick.  It helps to have a strong team together when you try to make fresh a series that now has twelve films in its roster.
 We love Star Trek for Kirk and his crew mates, not for the exploding starships.  The explosions are a bonus.  Besides Pine we have Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana back as Spock and Uhura.  In the current universe, these two are lovers which gives rise to some human vs Vulcan dating humor.  Karl Urban is the crotchety, dedicated healer, Bones.  Comic actor Simon Pegg plays Scotty the engineering genius.  Rounding out the regulars are John Cho as Sulu and Anton Yelchin as Chekov.
 In supporting roles we are gifted with Bruce Greenwood, Benedict Cumberbatch and Peter Weller with Cumberbatch playing the diabolically clever super human villain Kahn.  Beautiful Alice Eve appears as the new science officer in what may be a recurring role.  Kirk seemed to like her looks.
 The plot involves the re-appearance after 300 years of Khan and his crew of genetically modified super men in a pre-shadowing of their adventures in Star Trek-The Wrath of Khan.  Khan is a match for anyone, even, it seems for our heroic captain.  Without giving anything away, lots of stuff happens, most of it filmed beautifully.  There are few sights in the explored galaxy as beautiful as a star ship shown against the klieg-light intensity of the stars in deep space.
 J.J. Abrams directed Star Trek (2009) which introduced this crew.  The 2009 film brought in slightly more in the opening week end.  Into Darkness scored a massive $165 million in worldwide box office in four days against a budget of $190 million.  Abrams also directed the block buster Mission Impossible III and the mid budget and very successful artistically and financially Super 8.
 The PG-13 film runs for a satisfying two hours and three minutes.  Our old pal Leonard Nimoy has a small role as the elder Spock, a time warp thingy has both the young and the old Spock alive at the same time.
 Director Abrams skirted close to the line the separates truly enjoyable action films from tedious explosion feasts, but he doesnt cross that line.  We have the tradition of the well known characters, good acting and clever writing as well as his careful directors hand to thank.",1427500800,,2758,4.6777546777546775

The few people who diss this movie are extremists among the fandom, nostalgia-blinded people who were already decided to hate any new Trek before even watching it.
It's been my experience that the real Trekkies, people who have been fans of TOS for so many years like me, love the reboot too. It has all the heart and soul of Trek, presented in a modern package. It has made Trek beloved of the mainstream public too, instead of just us fans.

I strongly recommend this movie to anyone, old time fan or newcomer to Star Trek. It's a wonderful movie, and the new cast really does justice to the cast we've lovingly watched for so many years.",1427414400,,770,4.340277777777778

5284382,5,B009934S5M,"Okay so I'm going to be straight up with you, most of you are going to like the first one better. I personally like this one better and here's why.

What some of you are not going to like is the talking and emotional stuff. Personally, I think it adds depth to the characters. You get to see a wider range of emotion from Chris Pine's acting (and Zachary Quinto's but he's Vulcan so . . . well his portrayal of Spock has always been a little more emotional lets be honest). And you see him deal with grief and how it affects his decision and how it makes him a better man by doing the right thing despite his anger and hatred. I do think the emotional stuff between Spock and Uhura (though somewhat funny) was unneeded as I did not feel like it was really resolved unlike the emotional scenes between Kirk and Spock. Watching it, it seems Spock gives more concern to how Kirk's feeling than his girlfriend (I do believe their relationship is in fact doomed since in TOS Uhura ends up with Scotty, Not until Sat Trek 5 but I digress).

This movie has a completely different tone than the first. While the first one was witty, funny, and just plain fun, meeting the characters and watching them get into their roles. This movie is a bit darker. Dealing with death and somewhat betrayal.  Don't get me wrong, this movie still has it's funny parts. Kirk can't help but throw in that one line even in a serious situation to make the audience laugh. I just feel that because of the tone change the first and second movie shouldn't really be judged together as they are both good in their own way.

Thing I hate most. In TOS (The Original Series) it was always about Spock, Kirk, and Bones. Once again, this movie and it's predecessor focus on Spock, Kirk, and Uhura. I like Uhura. I really do. She's a strong willed, independent woman, who can stab Klingons. Awesome, but I did not want to see her so much. I like Bones in TOS. I love the trio's dynamic. This has none of that dynamic as Bones inserts a witty one liner and is off screen for the next twenty minutes.

Benedict Cumberbatch. Say what you want about a white guy playing Khan, but he did such a good job at it. Well he plays crazy really well and truthfully, despite his crazy guy ambitions, he's kind of right. Just saying. His performance of the insane genius superhuman is great and it was a pleasure to watch him on the big Screen. (Can't wait to watch Sherlock Season 4)

The plot. Well . . . sigh. . . to be honest, they did take parts of Wrath of Khan. When I first watched it, I had never seen TOS or it's movies so I didn't know who Khan was or what happened in the end of Star Trek II, but because I did not know anything about it. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot. After seeing Wrath of Khan I still do, but they did put in references to the movie that might annoy some people. We got to see Klingons for the first time and debating on the repercussions from this movie, we might see them next time too.

Overall, I love this movie. I mean loooooove this movie. I love the first one two, but I like watching this one as a higher preference. Some of you will not take too the talking and emotional stuff (though really I didn't think there was as much as people kept claiming. It felt pretty balanced), some will appreciate it. Some will think the plot is a rip off from Wrath of Khan, some will not depending on your stance (I'm saying no cause there's no Genesis Project). I think there is more depth and character development and Kirk and Spock's friendship becomes deeper for it. It's still a good movie. This movie got me interested in TOS and I now I enjoy TOS and Abramsverse as two separate beings. It's a great access to those who don't think they can suffer through the 60s silliness right off the back (that and the first 3 or 4 really bad episodes). So FIVE STARS!!!! . . . .

I appreciate the film delving into how Khan first crossed the Enterprize; and leaving him captured and frozen, but not dead, was a nice touch. As before, the actors do a nice job channeling their ""older selves"". For those who haven't seen it yet, be forewarned that this sequel is far more serious (and deadly) than the previous.

One argument Einstein gave against time travel was that if one could go back into time and kill their parents before they were born then a paradox would arise. But what kind of paradoxes will arise in the continuing narrative of this Enterprise is anyone's guess especially given the twists in the plot that have shown up in both movies.

It took me almost the whole day to put two and two together that my dream was based off this movie cause I fell asleep during the first 20 mins that night. So cool!

This second movie Trek movie was entertaining and held my interest two things I look for in a movie. Since grew up on the original StarTrek, the original series as it was aired, the theme for this movie was too much of a repeat.  Movies are for entertainment only and this fits the bill.",1426550400,,408,4.342105263157895

5284578,4,B009934S5M,"Hard to imagine this as a remake of what I thought was the best Star trek movie yet. You won't see the spectacular special effects as the enterprise shoots it's phasers upon the hull of the hijacked reliant. Hijacked by a character from the original series. ST2 saved the franchise. It was a fan movie. This one is for the fans of today. The battle scenes are spectacular but too fast. Reliant is not in this movie but a hijacked weapon of mass destruction in the shape of a giant, super secret starship built by Starfleet's Black Inventory. The concept of the Dreadnaught class ship has been part of star trek lore for many years. In fact, the final episode of Star Trek, the Next generation sported an updated Dreadnaught class Enterprise. It was commanded by Riker. This one had phaser cannons, a cloaking device (that allows the ship to pass through solid matter) and Warp 13 capabilities! If you like the original series books...read 'Dreadnaught'. Similarities between that book and this movie are evident. Except in this version, the dreadnaught ship is hijacked by Kahn and not the 'concerned' factions of the Federation, Klingon and Romulan empires. The crash scene is possibly one of the most dramatic for the genre, and the most realistic.",1426464000,6,1250,4.818604651162791

I wanted to like it a lot, but the gaping plot holes and stupidity of the characters insult the viewer's intelligence. The best parts are directly lifted from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan from 1982. Go watch that movie instead of this one.

Quinto's Spock is reasonable, but comes off merely as an imitation of Nimoy's characterization - and Quinto is very one dimensional.

5284689,3,B009934S5M,"What the newest Star Trek movie lacks that the series and the movies with the original cast (and even the ""Next Generation"" cast) is a sense of something of a believable story line, within the context of the science fiction genre, anyway.  We're supposed to accept that the main ""villain,"" Admiral Marcus, has worked his entire life as a loyal Star Fleet officer, but goes off the rail to blackmail a group of superhumans in suspended animation and kill hundreds of people in Star Fleet in order to start a war with the Klingons.  The Khan character, who has lots of history in the Star Trek series is well played by Benedict Cumberbatch, but once again the possibility of really developing a good story line is given second place to a lot of CGI effects, complete with people defying gravity, physics, etc. with all the flying and jumping around on vehicles moving through space and in the atmosphere.  It just gets to be a bit too much for ""suspension of disbelief.""  The CGI special effects are good and to be expected in a science fiction movie about space travel and space travelers, but it has always been the case that a great story line is what makes a great movie.",1425945600,,1173,4.571428571428571

5284749,1,B009934S5M,"This movie is so dog aweful I have no idea where to even begin.  What ever this trash is it is certainly NOT Star Trek.  Abrams clearly does not know what he is doing, and has no business being associated with the Star Trek franchise.

 I am a huge fan of other sci fi fantasy franchises & other epics such as ""Conan the Barbarian"", ""Star Wars"", ""Game of Thrones"", ""Batman"", ""Braveheart"", ""Highlander"", ""Independence Day"", ""X-Files"", ""The Hobbit"", ""Captain America"", & ""Jurassic Park"" because they are spectacular.  But in my mind, the entire ""Star Trek"" franchise is absolutely superior to them all in many ways, first because ST is a thinking person's franchise it is NOT all about fighting, second ST brings us all a positive and extraordinary message of goodness and a brighter great future universe for all humanity, the bad guys are powerful but UNLIKE ""Game of Thrones"" the villains ultimately lose big to the greater power of both wisdom, logic, reason, and ethical goodness.  What we have in this reboot is a dumbing down of ST, in order to fit into what ""Star Wars"" or ""Conan"" is, an action only epic with little to no brainpower.  The actor who plays Commander Spock is very good, but this material does not really allow him to shine and bring the best out of the late Mr. Nimoy's earlier work which made the character.

  The first redo of this movie was okay & entertaining, but they have drastically altered these original characters so much that now the franchise is not recognizable.

 Out of ALL the Star Trek characters they could have gone into, they picked to re-enact Khan, then they COMPLETLEY ruin him.  This actor is very good, this is not his fault at all but he looks and acts nothing like the master the late Ricardo Montobahn.

 And their portrayal of Spock only physically looks like him, other then that they have made Spock into a sort of commando type guy instead of the intellectual giant who only gets into fist or gun fights when he has to.  I just could not except this movie's version of the classical Star Trek characters.  And the Enterprise was underwater??? Huh?

  This movie is really bad and I can only recommend for true Star Trek fans like myself to please demand from Hollywood a work of art worthy of the name ""Star Trek"".  F+ & thumbs down.",1425686400,2,2289,4.616336633663367

5284796,5,B009934S5M,"Okay I admit it. I am a trekkie. When I say the first reinvention of the Star Trek story with Kirk and Spock, I held my breath when they used time travel to create an alternate future, namely, destruction of Vulcan home world. Now, of all things, they encounter none other than Noonian Sigh Kahn. Kahn is in this reality tougher, smarter, and more agressive than the original. The Apaches used to judge a man's strength by the strength of his enemies. Kahn is evil enough, strong enough and smart enough to make Kirk and Spoc reach deep inside and find the hero within. This movie is superbly done, with breathtaking action, and yes, gets Kirk in trouble more than once with the authorities.

Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant as Khan. In fact, the whole cast shone on this one. It is interesting that what almost did Kirk in here, was the same thing that killed Spoc in ""The Wrath of Khan."" This ""flip"" showed that Kirk indeed had it in him to regard the ""needs of the one outweigh the needs of the few, or one.""

5284877,5,B009934S5M,"This review is strictly regarding the 3D edition.

I'm just starting my 3D collection so I'm not exactly an ""expert"" yet, but I am seeing big differences in older movies being converted after the fact and more modern movies.  I suppose the key is whether it was originally shot in high-def or not (for instance, I'm comparing Star Trek to Jurassic Park, obviously a much, much older movie).

This film is STUNNING in 3D.  I'd say second only to Avatar, which I made the mistake of watching first and am now realizing that nothing else will probably look as good; but this comes close.  The picture is so crisp and clear anyway, but for instance when Spock goes into the volcano, each individual lava spark floats around your face.  When they go into warp, the star field sucks you into it.  To say nothing of Kirk and Khan navigating through the debris.

Extremely well done, and not overdone.  Whereas most movies seem to focus only on key scenes to enhance with 3D, this one keeps it going throughout, then doubles down on scenes with obvious opportunities (like weapons pointed at the screen, or Khan's fist coming through the brig's wall for the blood sample).  Even the end credits are a thing of beauty, with the planets seeming to hang right in your living room.

The 3D version has made this movie that I liked okay (let's face it; it's not perfect) into one that I love, and looking forward to watching again and again, even with friends.  I don't see how anyone can not be wowed by it.",1425168000,2,1495,4.537313432835821

Yesterday Leonard Nimoy passed on to his new journey, but he left  wonderful legacy and the new cast
in my opinion is living up to the tradition.  The plot of meeting Khan again in an alternate universe in a completely
different way was very gripping and the ending was superb.  I am a Trekkie from 1966 when I was nineteen, and
ST was like a dream of the future to those of us who believed it would eventually happen.  Full body scan now are done
in the hospitals, mobile body scans for specific body area now exist.  We have the shuttle crafts, there is no limit to the
future if can learn to work together as a  world.  And look at all the spin off in the ST universe.  Deep Space Nine, ST the New Generation,

But under the Star Trek banner there are just too many differences. I haven't even seen all of the old movies, and have only a passing knowledge of ST cannon, but even I can't help but feel like they've taken key parts of the traditional ST universe and tossed out or changed important elements randomly. Avoiding spoilers... Pike? Really? That character goes all the way back to the original series I watched as a kid, and this movie disregards all of that. So if you don't give a flying fig about Star Trek and just want some juicy sci-fi adventure, this is a great movie. If you've ever watched Star Trek and enjoyed the ongoing story line, and aren't sure about seeing established characters thrown in a bucket of what-the-heck and shaken up, skip this one.",1425081600,,890,4.60377358490566

My spouse was slightly more forgiving until he really thought about it, then he decided he was insulted by this mess of ridiculousness. No one should accept this ""Kirk"" as the best captain and problem-solver in Star Fleet: he's a selfish, inflexible, self-aggrandizing little brat. He in no way exemplifies the qualities that Star Trek promotes (intelligence, compassion, open-mindedness, and peace).  He makes the entire human race a laughingstock, regardless of your belief in a more perfect future.  And J. J. Abrams has taken one of the most interesting Trek villains and made him a caricature, with no rationale or motivation anyone with two brain cells to zap together could believe.  Lastly (or the last thing I want to waste time talking about), the amount of money spent on blowing ""stuff"" up in this film is embarrassing.  How is this story telling?  He's taken actors who really can act and has made them sad stick puppets showing a story about as well written as Fast & Furious 97 or Transformers 14.  It's hideous. Look away.  Save your mind.

5284982,1,B009934S5M,"I do not consider a 1 star rating for this movie to be a hyperbolic critique of what is without a doubt the worst of all the Star Trek movies. Now, hold on, hold on, it is not the worst MADE. The production values are solid and Abrams still knows his way around a camera, lens flares notwithstanding. There is no set design as shoddy looking as Star Trek V or any set pieces and cringe-inducingly dull as Star Trek: Insurrection. The cast remains solid, and any criticisms of the acting can only be seen as a subjective preference for one crew over the other.

No, where the film flatlines, and flatlines HARD, is the script.

This screenplay is a start to finish disaster on every level.

1) The Plot: The plot is riddled with redundant beats and serious logic problems. For starters, Kirk is told that he is to be stripped of his command and sent back to the Academy for his reckless antics in the opening sequence (more on that later). In Kirk's next character beat, he is told that rather than going back to the Academy, he will be Capt. Pike's first officer. In his very next character beat, following the attack which leaves Pike dead, he is immediately reinstated as Captain. You could not ask for a more perfect example of completely unnecessary ""developments"". There is of course the argument that the real story here is Kirk learning to be more responsible and less reckless in command, but these beats do not further that story, they only present a linear series of consequences that, 20 minutes later, have evaporated into thin air. This is just one example of plotting that goes nowhere.

There is also the logic of Khan's plan, which is so filled with coincidences as to be laughable even by movie standards. In a nutshell, he uses his magic blood to save a sick child so that her father who has access to a top secret Starfleet facility will blow it up, knowing that he will tell Starfleet Command who put him up to it, so that the same top brass will have a secret meeting on the top floor of a building out in the wide open, so that he can shoot them with his space helicopter, and then trans-warp teleport (more on THAT later, too) to the Klingon home world IN THE HOPES that Starfleet will send a ship to kill him using EXACTLY the 72 prototype torpedoes that he just happened to hide his hibernating crewmates. And that's IT. That is the dastardly and completely fool proof plan of the superior intellect.

That's the kind of plotting that the movie is hoping you'll be too inundated with explosions to notice. There is of course the mustache-twirling Admiral Robo-Cop's hole-ridden plan to start a war with the Klingons without it appearing as if Starfleet started the conflict, as well as the head-scratching decision to build your top-secret, illegal warship in a giant facility so close to Earth that Scottie is able to a) find it accidentally in a shuttle and then b) sneak in without any difficulty whatsoever, just getting in line with the other shuttles.

There's more, but do you really need more?

2) Characters: None of the characters are really very good representations of how the crew has been presented since TOS's inception, but none are as blatantly wrong as Spock. Spock is constantly raging out in the new movie continuity. The movie's climactic sequence is Spock - the emotion-suppressing pinnacle of intellect and reason, in a FIST FIGHT with Khan. Spock's mood swings are so erratic and out of character (they are always brought on by stress, as opposed to in the show, when Nimoy's Spock only lost control during periods of biological imperative) that he no longer serves his role as the level-headed, logical component in the three-headed consciousness of Kirk/Spock/Bones. He is instead merely a repressed rage-a-holic.

3) World-building: The movie shows a complete contempt for the ""science"" aspect of ""science fiction"" and the important role that it has always served in Star Trek. The movie uses technology as logic-defying magical instruments, which serves only to shatter the entire way in which the Star Trek universe is constructed. There are many examples, but the most glaring are Khan's personal trans-warp device and his magic blood. The trans-warp device, as has been noted many other places, completely breaks the rules of Star Trek. What use are starships when someone with a device the size of a backpack can transport themselves instantly from one planet to another planet millions and millions of lightyears away? Now people can jump wherever they want, whenever they want, at a moment's notice. So I guess Star Trek 3 won't even need an Enterprise at all.

The magic blood also breaks a fundamental rule of any fictional universe. Khan's blood can literally bring people back from the dead. There is no more death in the Star Trek universe, unless, I guess, you are incinerated. So no more of those pesky ""stakes"" or ""consequences"" for the rest of the series. Phew!

There's also the matter of, y'know, the Enterprise being underwater for some reason in the opening. So they won't be seen? Are you telling me the indigenous tribes of the planet would be able to see the Enterprise in SPACE? And wouldn't being in space solve that whole ""needing a clear line of sight"" to transport Spock out of the volcano problem? I guess that means there is a clear line of sight between Earth and Kronos? But hey, at least Spock got his COLD FUSION DEVICE (you know the kind that would in theory generate MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF HEAT) to freeze the volcano...

3a) Fan Service: The writers of this film really have no idea what true fan service is. All they do here is cram in ham-fisted references to the far superior film that they've stolen most of their cues from. Re-enacting the death of Spock from Wrath of Khan, but reversing the roles so that it is Kirk that dies, completely misses the point of the original sequence. In WoK, it was a shocking revelation to Kirk that there really are consequences to no win scenarios, and that no matter how clever you are, sometimes it takes sacrifice to achieve the greater good. Here in Into Darkness, all Kirk's death does is get Spock revved up for some good old fashioned face punchin'. Empty and pointless.

There's more, good God there's more, but I've already overdone it on my nerdrage quotient for the day. Now if you'll excuse me, I think maybe it's time I popped Wrath of Khan into the blu ray player to watch a science fiction tale with great characters, pervasive emotional themes, logical set pieces, and excellent plotting.",1424822400,6,6529,4.712532865907099

In many ways it varies from the series at the same time quiet often the actors really do a good job of bringing you back. At times they even look their parts. Even if you don't care about the original series you'll find it entertaining. I couldn't bring myself to give it 5 stars though since at times it seemed to get way over the top on unbelievable situations. Also the whole scene with what at first glance looks like the Millennium Falcon flying through the death star but what the heck it was still fun.,1424736000,,582,4.3

It is a wild ride from opening scene to closing -- lots of action while still having good character development and fun dialogue.  Sure the plot has some really weak points, And there are some weird casting decisions (like why would someone named Khan be so white and why would a younger Carol Marcus have a British accent that disappears in middle age), but the rest of the cast is so strong this is forgivable.  I'm not a big fan of the JJ-reboot (I would have preferred TOS consistent stories of a young Lt Kirk instead), but I had too much fun to give this a movie a bad review.

I was 1 of a group of many college fans who went to dinner late -  we had to wait for Trek reruns to end. So here is my humble opinion based solely on decades of watching all Star Trek episodes, off-shoots, and movies.
I THOUGHT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL !!!
I enjoyed it immensely! I laughed, cried, clapped, cheered, throughout. I thought it was great. Gene Roddenberry surely enjoyed it from space. They stuck to Mr Roddenberry's overall theme and ideals. I got the biggest kicks from ""inside joke""  items that only a Trekkie would get. I loved watching the characters we know and love, develop and interact for the first time.
  AND, OF COURSE, HAVING LEONARD NEMOY APPEAR WAS A REAL TREAT.

5285066,5,B009934S5M,"This Star Trek Into Darkness movie is astounding. I have watched in both 3D and not 3D and both are excellent.

Now I watched the original TV series starting in 1966 (in black and white, which did not concern me.) It was a complete change from anything anyone had seen before. I walked the halls of junior high giving Klingon, Vulcan, and Romulan salutes to nearly everyone. There was also a lot of bestowing of the Peace of Landrew on each other as we passed. And when the first motion picture came out I was again amazed at how well the Star Trek universe was visualized on screen. And then there was Wrath of Khan, TNG, Deep Space Nine, and so on. All of them wonderful.

But the most recent two movies Star Trek (2006) and Into Darkness are the best of all.

I think the story telling is better and the acting more intense and much more realistic. In the past Captain Kirk was always treated with more deference and respect than other captains but it wasn't clear why. I KNOW why now.

His tough times growing up, which he is still doing, and his basic character and the link with his father combine to make a singular person. He is a fiercly loyal, a dangerous feisty brawler, excellent tactition, and stategist. And he uses whichever of these elements are needed to achieve whatever he thinks must get done.

Not only did he save the earth and the rest of the Federation planets,he did it while taking command of the Enterprise as a third year cadet with a crew of mostly cadets that he LEADS into giving the best of their briliance and resourcefulness even though they were scared out of their minds at the time. Chris Pine, Zach Quinto, Carl Urban, and all the others performances were more powerful and meaningful to me than their precedents. The cast is doing a superb job.

I'm all in with Star Trek, but those who aren't that went with me to see the movie, or whom I was able to send to see it, were delighted by the movie. You don't need to be a trekker to understand what's going on. It's just great entertainment.",1424476800,,2028,4.409090909090909

5285084,5,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness is simply a fun, multi-layered adventure that is well cast, directed, acted and grounded in great special effects. It's a drama sprinkled with appropriate comic relief  (Simon Pegg and sidekick, Spock and Uhura liaison), adventure, moral and ethical quandaries, and familiar, yet newly-spun threads between the crew members and Captain Kirk. (Oh, and did I mention that Chris Pine is perfect as the brash and energetic young Kirk? Or that, as always, Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a stunning performance, as Khan?)

Its homage to earlier Trek movies and storylines is apparent, with the bending of time and space, modernizing it for the current fan-base of Trekkies. I am an unabashed J.J. fan, so my take on the film is very likely prejudiced. That being said it is a tight piece of work, enjoyable on many levels.

So often when I watch a film, especially those based on previous characters, worlds, or storylines I am struck by incongruences, or weaknesses in characterization, which, for me, bring me out of immersion in the film. I did not experience this at any time, but felt fully engaged as the story unfolded.

It is a great, enjoyable film and (for me) deserves high placement as the current incarnation of the Star Trek universe.

The chemistry between Pine, Quinto, and Urban is wonderful. The humor was spliced in at the right amount. The revision of Uhura as scrappy and more rough-and-ready--and in a love affair with Spock--provides some good fun as well. The lesser characters were all fine in their new skins. Casting Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan was a mistake--Benny is a great actor of course, but simply not right for Khan. Fortunately that did not spoil the overall experience for me.

5285180,4,B009934S5M,"I have long been a Star Trek Fan dating back to the late 80's. This reboot is pretty good as is doing a fine job of refreshing the franchise. The movie contains ample actions scenes, has a decent storyline, the actors do a pretty good job and there are plenty of throwbacks to the original movie Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.

The plot swirls around the genetically enhanced Khan exacting revenge upon Starfleet for his perceived injustices against him and his fellow genetically enhanced friends and family. If you know any Star Trek lore, you'll know that Genetically Enhanced humans fought a bloody war against normal people called the Mutagenic Wars. After normal people won, they outlawed all genetically enhanced people and put them all into deep freeze aboard a secret space station. Throughout the first 2/3 of the movie, Khan continually outwits Starfleet high command along with Kirk and Spock. Below is a skeleton of the plot.

The movie starts with Kirk and Spock trying to save an alien race from destruction by stopping a volcanic eruption. The prime directive expressly forbids this and due to the locals seeing the Enterprise rise out of the ocean and fly away along with Kirk and Spock's interactions, Spock is reassigned and Kirk is demoted to second in command of the Enterprise with Admiral Pike taking command. Enter Khan who persuades an insider to blow up a secret Starfleet Intel Center in London. As a result, Starfleet holds an emergency meeting of all the high level admirals and captains. Khan is waiting for them and manages to kill many of them including Admiral Pike, putting Kirk back in command. Khan escapes and transports himself to the Klingon homeworld. Kirk learns this and take off in pursuit. They infiltrate Klingon space with easy and make it to the Klingon system with no problems where they get into a firefight on the ground with the Klingons. Khan comes to the rescue and Kirk then arrests him. Khan then convinces Kirk that there is a conspiracy at the highest levels of Starfleet to start a war against the Klingons and kirk begins to ask questions. The admiral in charge of the secret operation to start this war takes a new Dreadnaught Class warship to confront Kirk. Of course this ship is faster and more powerful than the Enterprise. Kirk takes off back to Earth trying to outrun the Dreadnaught but is caught just before reaching Earth. The Enterprise is nearly destroyed until Scotty manages to sabotage the Dreadnaughts power grid from within. Kirk and Khan then ""spacejump"" across the debris field to the Dreadnaught where they take control of the ship and Khan kills the rogue admiral. Kirk then turns on Khan and knocks him out. Khan quickly regains control of this new Dreadnaught and blackmails Spock into transporting Khans family and friends to the Dreadnaught. Spock instead transports 43 torpedo's to the Dreadnaught and the subsequent damage all but destroys the Dreadnaught. However, both ships are adrift now and begin to fall into Earths atmosphere. The Enterprise regains engines the last minute thanks to Kirk realigning the engines himself which the radiation kills Kirk (an obvious through back to the Original Wrath of Khan movie where Spock does the exact same thing) and is saved while the Dreadnaught crashes into San Francisco. Khan survives the crash and attempts to run again. Spock pursues him and nearly kills Khan before being stopped by Ohura and McCoy who tell him that Khan's blood can bring Kirk back to life. The movie ends with Kirk waking up, Khan in deep freeze with his family and friends and war with the Klingons averted.

Some of the things I didn't like were a couple plot holes.
1) In every Star Trek movie, show and book, the border between the Klingon Empire and the Federation is heavily fortified and monitored by both sides. Yet in this movie, the Enterprise makes it all the way to the Klingon Homeworld and nearly lands a captured pirate shuttle on the surface before they are detected. This would be nearly impossible as the Klingons Empire was larger, had more ships and was stronger than Starfleet was. The odds of the Flagship of Starfleet making it that far undetected is astronomically low.
2) The battle between the Dreadnaught and the Enterprise takes place near Earth's moon yet a few minutes after the battle concludes, both ships are falling through Earth's atmosphere about to be destroyed. This is physically impossible for both ships as both ships had no engines and no power, thus gravity could not have pulled them from the Moon to Earth in a matter of minutes, hours or days.
3) Khan and Kirk spacejump yet again (just like the first reboot movie) from one ship to the other because transporters are out. Yet, a few minutes after arriving on the other ship, the Enterprises transporters are working again.
4) There is a brief 30 second appearance of Leonard Nemoy as the Elder Spock that was entirely unnecessary and detracted from the movie. It didn't really add any content as all the elder Spock says is that ""Khan was the most clever and ruthless opponent the Enterprise ever faced"".

Overall, this was yet another amazing movie from JJ Abrams. It's a must see for anyone who likes sci-fi or action movies.",1424390400,,5234,4.81868743047831
5285181,3,B009934S5M,"I prefer to read Carl Sagan and Michio Kaku instead of watching this DVD. It is a big disappointment since I am a fan of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn. I did not give it one since it is a big improvement from the first one. I wish Chris Pine acted more like William Shatner. I felt that he tries to be more like Harrison Ford, which is a mistake.",1424304000,,348,3.8472222222222223
5285182,2,B009934S5M,"What made the original Star Trek a hit was that it stretched the imagination without stretching it far beyond the limits of believability. In this movie, many scenes were stretched way beyond those limits as is often done with special effects in movies today. Having powerful special effects available does not justify the use of them, especially when it makes scenes that could be imagined as believable become totally unbelievable.

Other things that detract from believability were:
1) Enemy weapon fire that has no built-in guidance on their own. Even with today's technology we have heat and radar seaking missiles.
2) The Enterprise uses what looks like chemical thrusters that ignite to provide fine maneuvering of the ship. Give us a break. Isn't this supposed to  represent technology of the far future.
3) The crew of the Enterprise were all way too young to be believable in their roles.

I hate it when good stories are reduced to comic book type fantasies. When a movie strays too far beyond what is believable, it ruins the movie for me. I guess movies these days are made to entertain children rather than thinking adults. As far as I'm concerned, many of today's movie makers that produce this kind of trash should be replaced with real talent!",1424304000,2,1260,4.878504672897196

5285192,2,B009934S5M,"Part of what made ""Star Trek"" so enjoyable was seeing how they were matching up this prequel series with what came before, With ""Into Darkness,"" however, they went completely off the rails. There were some good setpieces and a plot that was interesting and suspenseful, but a little over halfway through it all fell apart. You get a hint of this when they kill off Christopher Pike and you ask yourself, ""What does this do to 'The Cage' and Pike's fate as recounted there?""

Then comes the revelation that this is Khan back from Ceti Alpha V (where ""Space Seed"" left him and we discover him in ""Wrath of Khan""). How he gets back there for ""Wrath"" we never discover (remember that Khan says Kirk never checks up on him after the ""Space Seed"" exile?). And don't forget that Kirk never saw Khan until ""Space Seed,"" which supposedly comes AFTER the events in this film.

Then we get yet another return of Nimoy Spock, and the rip-off of the Spock death scene from ""Wrath"" except here it's reversed and Kirk dies. This is what passes for originality in Hollywood: Do the same thing, but have the other guy die this time! It gets more and more ridiculous from there (a transfusion from Spock, whose blood also revives tribbles?), and all you want is for it to end before you run screaming from the theater.

This is part of the ""reboot"" of ""Star Trek,' which like the Bond ""kill all humor and copy Bourne"" reboot, boldly goes where the original creators knew better than to go before. Message to Hollywood: Please, no more ""reboots.""",1424131200,2,1527,4.586080586080586

Why couldn't you use the Jesus tribble (revived using platelets)???  And what causes more damage, the Vengeance in free fall from orbit, or one guy on a fire truck?  If you dropped the Vengeance from 200 000+ km, you don't have to aim too hard; you will make a crater the size of San Francisco!  Too bad J J Abrams doesn't hire people that didn't sleep through high school physics classes...

5285273,5,B009934S5M,"This new set of Star Trek movies is much more than just a reboot as it serves as the prequel to the original Gene Roddenberry TV series that launched us into space in 1966. IMO the characters were perfectly cast for their older counter-parts and the story-line is great, with several twists and turns along the way. From the opening where Kirk (Chris Pine) defies the Prime Directive to the USS Enterprise chasing a bad guy to the Klingon world and an encounter with a super-advanced warship, Kirk, Spock (Zachary Quinto) & their crew are pushed to the absolute limits. This movie has it all: great acting, quality visual effects, plenty of action scenes, and the inevitable one-liners. Simply stated, this is entertainment at its best, especially when sitting down on a lazy weekend and watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-2009/dp/B00471JSRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek (2009)</a>&nbsp;and this one back-to-back.",1422230400,2,980,5.8125

5285276,2,B009934S5M,"I watched this star trek into darkness perhaps more than 5 times and the more I watch the movie, the more I am convinced that the story line is full of flaws. For example, what is the motivation of Kirk constantly not obeying the order from the federation while in mission? Why did admiral's daughter not listen to his father and advocate Kirk and co-workers when confronted? There is no character build up during the movie which leads to such rebellious acts committed by the daughter.

But with both SF franchises becoming quite cheesy over the years, I was very reluctant to start watching the Star Trek reboot. I am glad I did as it is a great way to spend the Friday or Saturday night. Into Darkness achieves the goal of so many sequels; being good, maybe even better than the original (in the reboot). The grim storyline, the sarcastic form of humor an a pretty interesting storyline make it a week two hours spent for any science fiction buff.

He embraced every hackneyed, cliche, Spielberg-esque cliffhanger he could get his hands on. There isn't one surprise, twist, or revelation in this piece of Abrams. AND, he also decided to rewrite Star Trek history.

I've found the ""digital"" versions nearly impossible to get Installed and working - I HATE the Flixter, HD...., Ultra Violet non-sense all of them have an unclear and unnecessarily difficult registers room process that at the mini,I, is confusing, etc...

I've tried to registered for these ""bozonic"" services and my registration does not work, I don't even get a reply to reset my password or username.

5285307,5,B009934S5M,"In this next episode of `Kirk: The Early Years', J.J. Abrams brings us the next instalment - `Who was Khan and why was he so cross?' This movie is about as far away as it is possible to get from my earliest fond memories of Star Trek with wobbly sets on the old black & white goldfish bowl telly; it is big-budget super-slick non-stop action from start to finish.

However, rather than being yet another soulless spin-off blockbuster or some daft comic book nonsense, the central characters have developed real depth ,there is a deft lightness of touch, a deep vein of wit and plenty of little references back to the original series (...but a tribble... really?). The script is superb and the cast from the beautifully enunciated Khan, through Kirk and Spock down to the lowliest, luckless red jumper are exactly what you'd expect. Pedants beware though - the story line does not dovetail neatly with the proper, original series episodes featuring either Captain Pike or Khan.

5285341,1,B009934S5M,"Into Darkness (Or ID(iot) as I call it) is a mess. It tries to be clever by making you think you know where the story is going because of its use of Wrath of Khan, but then pulls several twists. Twists that were painfully obvious and surprising to no one who was even remotely paying attention. It tries to pay homage to the Wrath of Khan, but instead is nothing more than a cheap rip-off. I'm pretty sure the ""author"" simply took the script for Wrath of Khan, shredded it, used the shredded wads as toilet paper, and then randomly pulled out anything that wasn't too badly soiled and randomly stuck the strips back together and called it a script.

The ending was particularly awful. In WoK you had an emotional farewell between two life-long friends. It had weight because there was no deus ex machina to ride in at the last second and save him (that came in Search for Spock). There was no last minute rescue. Spock died, and there was nothing to indicate he would ever come back. That was powerful. This was two near-strangers who were saying see you in a half hour because you already knew that the magic blood was going to save him. No emotional weight whatsoever.

And then there's the rampant sexism in the portrayal of the only two female characters, with Carol Marcus going from a brilliant scientist who created a technology to create habitable worlds, to half-naked eye-candy; and Uhura playing the part of stereotypical nagging girlfriend.",1420848000,21,1452,4.64591439688716

Spoiler alert it was a nice twist.  The cost of this set probably is due to the phaser prop.  The phaser prop is amazing.  It is beautifully designed and feels like the real deal when held.  It even switches from stun to kill modes. I can not give this thing enough praise.  It locks into the display stand giving it a solid fit into any bookcase or desk.",1420761600,,751,4.188811188811189

5285401,4,B009934S5M,"This is the next installment in Abram's reboot of the beloved and ground breaking franchise. While there are elements which will still bug die hard trekkies this all in all was a great follow up to the 2009 release of Star Trek. The characters felt like a cohesive crew. They were past the awkward ""getting to know you"" stage and now had the very much the chemistry of the Enterprise bridge crew.

Zachary Quinto once again shines as Spock. Christopher Pine continues to impress as a young, brash Captain Kirk. A big change in the chemistry of the crew is while in the original Trek series there seemed to be a special friendship that radiate between Kirk, Bones and Spock that clearly has been changed to be between Spock, Uhura and Kirk.

Speaking of Uhura, once again Zoe Saldana has taken Uhura from just being a ""communication's officer"" to a force with which to be reckoned. Her Uhura is smart, tough, and yes sexy. She is a very worthy heir to  Nichelle Nichols whose portrayal of Uhura was a role model for young women. Saldana's Uhura takes it to the next level.

The movie is exciting. It has the action, the twists and some of the emotional gut punches you'd expect. However, there are some missteps to deal with here.

For instance, since when does a Trek movie need a cheesy underwear shot? No, I'm not talking about catching Kirk in bed with a green alien. I'm talking about just shooting a scene of catching a female changing her clothes and showing her underwear for no reason. That belongs in a slasher movie, not Star Trek.

Also, while Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant, chilling and utterly mesmerizing there's a part of me that really does feel he was a little miscast. Once you learn the true identity of this foe it's hard not to frown a little and think, ""Did no one do any research on this character?""

As to the literal twist at the end of the movie I am torn. I personally liked it and found it a great twist. However, I do think if you are an old school Trek fan (like me) it's one you are either going to hate or love. The new generation of Trekkers may not know the twist so they get the raw emotional punch. Those of us who know all the old episodes and movies practically by heart will either get a raw poignant emotional punch or you'll get angry that one of the most crushing moments in Trek history got a redo.

As a Trekkie I do give props to this movie for trying to stay in the Trek tradition of carrying a moral message: the story has to be more than photons and phasers. However, there's still a large amount of explosions, fists, photons and seizure inducing lensflare for the new generation.

The plot could have been good but the motive was not, common mistake in movies made these days is the motive(or lack of) does not make me route for these facsimiilies of the orignal star trek characters. It iwas just another soap opra and a sappy one at that. Spock does NOT have relationships with Earth females he, Spock the VULCAN does NOT get hysterical and the scenes of Kirk hitting Khan repeatedly are then only rehashed again with spock doing the exact same thing and it is just a pathetic excuse to be a ""bad A___ And the corny ""I should stun you and drag your ass out of that chair but I won't do it in front of our daughter""  both disrespectful to a father and is a very ""Duck Dinasty line  for sure. I am sick of hearing so much of this same thing in every movie ever made sicne 2004!!!  This is NOT Star Trek! Anything made after Nemesis is NOT Star Trek Abhams like Lucas, Speilburg and so many others, needs to quit remaking movies and,  mutilating real fan's childhood and get creative and think of his own movies for the present.  He is not creative if he was he wouldn't' need to remake classics as  Star Wars, Star Trek and whatever else... And instead he would make his own sci fi titles and characters and leave the classics alone!  I think the speical effcects are 5 stars, of course, but the movie gets 2. 1 for effcets but the rest is default since I can't go below 1 star. This is nothing but Mad Max with a space ship!

I'm not one of those who feel as though it is sacrilege to use the names of Kirk and Spock for anyone other than Shatner and Nimoy.  I thought this was a pretty good Sci-Fi movie that happened to have Star Trek in the title.  I do like the references to the original Star Trek but at the same time feel as though they are propping the whole movie up on these throwback references.  To me, this takes away from this all new Star Trek movie.  I can't watch this without comparing it to older Star Trek because the whole story is based off of older Star Trek.

5285522,5,B009934S5M,"A very different spin to the Star Trek II the Wrath of Khan, In a nut shell the film sort of follows the basic story line from this film, but a few changes were made, first off Khan was supposed to be of Indian decent, with the time line changed its a different spin on Khan himself, unless I missed it the film doesn't explain how Khan and his followers were frozen in the first place.  Instead of finding Carol Marcus with son some years later, this film and this depends on how the 3rd star trek movie is going to be written, for a possible romance.  For the nay sayers JJ Abrams if anything deserves some leeway for  this version of Star Trek.  To be fair to him, the other Trek films were either very good, at times watchable or just plain bad.  Since Mr Abrams is now putting the final touches to Star Wars Ep 7 just going to have to wait and see how the 3rd trek films is handled from the script down to the director.  With that in mind the film is worth watching even if people just want to rent it.",1420070400,,1007,4.086294416243655

At first we did not like the new ships, we are purists who felt they should have honored the previous ships and time lines.  Once we let that go we have loved every minute of the new series.

Into Darkness is a remake of the second Star Trek movie with the villain again being the superhuman Khan.  It is a very different telling and is very dark.  There is the usual comedy to keep it light and the character development shines above the first movie.",1420070400,,566,4.2924528301886795

5285552,1,B009934S5M,"Spoiler alert:
""Into the Toilet"" as one reviewer commented. Kahn makes a third appearance in Star Trek history and the second on the silver screen. At best it's an amateur-ish rewrite/smashup of ""Kahn"" from the original series and Star Trek II the Wrath of Kahn. Poor character development and endless special effects for the sake of special effects. Halfway through I could guess every twist and assaulted from one impossible disaster after another after another. Of course countless Enterprise crew persons give their lives while the movie heralds the saving of lives of Spock and Kirk, yes both in one movie. Kahn, originally portrayed by Ricardo Montalban, is digressed here to a prettyboy anorexic bad boy with a snotty British accent bent on revenge just as before.

To me, it was a copy cat movie! I thought they could of done a different story line and gone down a different path.

They cast actors that resembled the original cast and kept the original Star Trek story and props pretty much the same.  It DIDN'T change the design of the Enterprise vessel one bit, except to beef up the GCI graphics of the outside and inside scenes.  Even the bridge of the ship resembled the bridge from the original series.  Its as if they are now finally listening to the actual fans and did what we all wanted instead of a board of directors making something they think we all want but don't.  (The Lost in Space movie would be a perfect example of this).  Into the Darkness had a very interesting story, great edge of your seat action scenes along with flawless GCI you would expect from a very high budget movie.

Loved everything about it -- Benjamin Cumberbatch may not be as drop dead handsome as Ricardo Montalban in his heyday, but he's every bit as diabolical and charming.  I still love Shatner and Nimoy, but Pine and Quinto are perfect as the younger versions.  The supporting actors for Bones, Chekov, Zulu, etc. are all very good too.

DeForest  Kelley would roll over in his grave if he heard those lines. The movie took the plot from a older Star Trek movie and tried to make a believable plot out of this movie. It , in my opinion, did not work. The movie is watchable, but. for those of us true Trekkies, we've seen this one before.

Cumberbatch makes the character eerily sympathetic, even as we know he has caused countless deaths in his vendetta against the Federation that put him and his fellow criminals from the past in cryogenic stasis. Other than Khan, though, the rest of the cast play ho hum rehashes of the more mature characters they're impersonating: randy, hotheaded Kirk, logical Spock, cranky Doc McCoy, and revved up Beam Me Up Scotty. There's a nice little plot twist revealing the true villain that makes things interesting, but as always, it's a glut of good versus evil with special effects.

When the first movie with the new ""young whipper-snapper"" crew was made a few years ago I had no desire to see it... but eventually watched it on TV. I LOVED IT!

But, with my new Amazon Prime I decide to watch it one evening and I AM BLOWN AWAY!  This movie was even better than the first one with the young crew.

5285938,5,B009934S5M,"The film is great overall.  Everything works great acting, likeable characters, great villain, the plot and script are smooth and story is riveting.  I liked how the film shows how Kirk and Spock's friendship has developed from the previous movie. The whole crew seem to be coming into there own.  Other reviewers have already explained the movie better than I can.  It is probably the best film in the whole movie series.

Spoiler Alert

The only problem I had with the whole film was the ending which to closely resembled Wrath of Kahn's ending.  I get the fact that the director wanted to show respect to previous films in the series.  But anyone who knows anything about radiation would know that if you go into a nuclear environment unprotected your brain would probably fry from the inside and you would probably pass out within seconds.  You can buy the idea of Spock being able to do it and die in the Star Trek 2 because he is an alien. I just thought that the director could have done something similar and not use the core scene to the same effect.  It still works and does not hurt the movie overall.

I liked this film much better than the Star Trek reboot which is a decent movie itself just not nearly as good as this film.  This movie deserves the praise it is receiving because it is worth watching.",1418688000,,1316,4.483193277310924

5285995,4,B009934S5M,"It was entertaining, the only thing was.... Why revive characters from an old storyline and then rewrite the original lore in a different way?  If you are going to have a completely new story, then why not introduce new characters? Otherwise, it was a good movie.  (Then again, it was j.j. Abrams, so what do you expect?  Should just be happy none of the characters completely changed personality back and forth 5 times :P)... (Well, apart from the Spock-Uhura thing... And I had trouble reconciling the new actress who played Uhura, she was too unlike Nichelle Nicholes... But they did give her more to do than in the original series--speaking Klingon, e.g., and that was a big plus).... So, 4 stars overall",1418428800,,708,4.786885245901639

So I have a great fondness for all things Star Trek. This movie did not disappoint. I enjoy'd the youthful characters of Kirk Uhura & Spock and the story line. I do plan to watch this again.

The addition of Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan was entertaining, even though it was a pretty obvious 'twist' to the movie. The special effects in this movie were great, especially the within-warp battle between the enterprise and the new and improved star ship. The way in which Kirk survives at the end is a little anti-climactic and spontaneous, but the movie was overall enjoyable nonetheless.",1416960000,,567,5.173913043478261

5286308,2,B009934S5M,Well they successfully destroyed the Star Trek saga in favor of a Die Hard type action movie with no plot.  Actually the story presented doesn't even make sense.  They turn the characters into spoofs of themselves.  There is no interesting idea to consider which is the hallmark of Star Trek.  Spock is more emotional than any other character ruining his character.  Since they destroyed the Star Trek story line I guess they can do whatever they want now.  Now they can go for the mass market and video games..,1416873600,2,511,4.685393258426966

While well-written and sporting a tight, entertaining plot, the ""re-used"" parts from the ""Wrath of Khan"" with the original story arc came off a bit stilted by the actors so involved, missing the original passion.

5286353,4,B009934S5M,"Overall, a satisfying, visually stunning, occasionally thought-provoking sci-fi actioner.  My only gripe about the movie is that, after
the 2009 reboot set up an alternate future, where we could have completely new adventures, this film already borrows from an
earlier Star Trek movie.  One scene, especially, so mirrors the earlier movie that I never for a moment truly believed the character
was in peril.  But the movie holds up well for repeat viewings, and I have long ago gotten over that mis-step.  Anyway, there is one
classic problem with serialized adventures.  You are pretty sure, for example, that James Bond or Indiana Jones aren't going to die
in their movies.  (Only Joss Whedon seems to get away with killing off beloved characters.)",1416528000,2,750,5.10655737704918

The difference is that the plot on this second movie is much more complicated and complex than the first one that had alot of witty one liners.  The themes in this second movie included very serious subjects like: revenge,  family loyalty, hate,  the ends justifies the means, etc.  Seeing this movie the second time made me realize how much i missed when i saw this movie the first time.

5286381,5,B009934S5M,"I have to say, I rarely enjoy a sequel as much as I enjoyed this one. My husband and I are admitted nerds when it comes to Star Trek, and this new revamping of an old story really does not disappoint (note: I am somewhat including the first movie in the overall equation here). This movie does stay true to the first movie's theme of ""time travel warping past, present, and future."" In fact, anyone who has seen the original movies from the 1980s will likely see the parallels to some of the original plot twists here, as well. The mastery of this film, though, is the way in which the story has woven together around those original themes. Overall, if this movie -- or the first -- is something you've been considering, I would highly recommend it. It appears that JJ Abrahms may have created a whole new generation of Star Trek fans -- and that is really wonderful in my opinion. Enjoy and ""Live long and prosper!"" :)",1416355200,,919,4.411764705882353

Lots of action, sometimes tinging on being too much, but still a good movie for a fan.  Die-hard fans will find discontinuities with prior Star Trek movies, as has been the case with many prequels in this and other franchises.  But, if you can let go of the absolute need to be consistent across all movies in a franchise, this has many merits.  We like all the actors who are playing younger versions of the very familiar and favorite characters we have watched for years.  They have captured the essence of the older characters whom they will become.  That's a big part of the fun in these prequels for us.",1416182400,,714,4.371212121212121

The writers really outdid themselves this time. Every actor portreying the younger stars of the original series shine so brightly you need sunglasses. It was such a pleasure to see Uhura finally being depicted as a complex, feisty, no nonsense, take charge kind of gal instead of simply being relegated to being a glorified telephone operator in the original series.

The closing score is wonderful, just wonderful.

I'm not giving anything away. JUST WATCH THIS MOVIE DAMMIT!!!! It's worth every second and every penny.

5286494,4,B009934S5M,"I hope J.J. Abrams will stay with the Star Trek franchise for a long time. His direction is superb, and he is so skilled at blending the technical details with the human element in each story. His rhythm and timing always feel just right, and even the slower, quiet scenes move along with a undercurrent of energy and vitality. ""Into Darkness"" is definitely a dark tale, with violence and malevolence driving the storyline. For that reason, I can't say I 'loved' it with five stars, but I nevertheless thought it was a work of excellence. Acting was superb as in the previous film, special effects stunning and impressive, and the storyline, although deeply disturbing at times, stayed grounded in the relationships among the crew and the moral conflicts presented in the scenarios. When I saw it the first time in the theatre, you could have heard a pin drop, it was so intense and engrossing. The only time I heard any noise, it was the sound of people quietly weeping and sniffling during some of the heartbreaking scenes. I wept as well. Although it couldn't be said that the ending was ""happy,"" it combined resolution with a sobering sense of the reality of the condition of the world that remained.",1415750400,,1204,4.738095238095238

5286509,5,B009934S5M,A roller coaster ride from start to finish. I found Chris Pine unnerving as Captain Kirk but then if Gene Roddenberry could put a younger William Shatner in another pilot of the original series I probably would have had the same reaction. Enjoy.,1415664000,,245,4.72093023255814

5286556,1,B009934S5M,"Don't know if such a late review is worth anything.  Anyone who's going to see it is going to see it or has already.  Can't really add much to anything else that's been said by everyone else.  I will say that the first two thirds of the movie are pretty decent, but the back third is so incredibly wrong that it negates any goodwill earned through the first half.  My mother, a Trekkie since the TV days, asked me to shut the movie off when it started going wrong, because it went SO wrong.  She never saw the ending, and having synopsized it for her, she was eternally grateful she hadn't.  It defiles the history of Trek to an unconscionable degree.  Alternate timeline or no, it's a mockery of the finest Trek film ever to grace the silver screen, and in attempting to emulate it, this film instead practically mocks it.  It could have gone a different way.  They could have made this premise work.  I'll be taking future Abramsverse films with an extreme grain of salt from now on.  That's sad, because I had no problem with the Abrams/Kurtzman/Orci take on Trek until this movie.  This was a big wakeup call.",1415577600,8,1113,4.455445544554456

5286758,1,B009934S5M,"While I'm interested in seeing Trek back on the screen, it felt like too much CGI, cheesy acting, and atrocious writing really ruined this film, and giving this a ""Star Trek II""-rewrite angle didn't work for me either (with a new Khan, and this time Kirk saving the day, not Spock, etc). Plus I'm still muddled on continuity: is this the same Shatner/Nimoy universe, but just one with a James Bond-style formula where actors are supposedly the same characters, yet replaced with different looking actors, over the years? Because it's hard to bridge this with the original series, especially with the Khan actor here looked and sounded nothing like Ricardo Montalban (a far superior Khan I think)

Also, after you watch this and can't help but wondering, did they just cure death with Khan's blood? Seems like that was a huge plot point, established early in the film with the healing of the sick kid and later in the complete recovery of Kirk. So what prevents the medicine of the future from further utilizing the Khan's blood technique of continuous healing and curing death?  Similiar issue in thsi film with the long-distance transporter beam. If something like this was possible, then you could essentially establish transporter points throughout the galaxy and then just easily jump anywhere you needed to go with little need of starships anymore, other than just a couple to setup jump points in space. Didn't anyone think through some of these story issues?
It was interesting to see Peter Weller as the rogue Starfleet character, but even that wasn't enough to save this film. Like the last film, it felt like this just continues to trash the original series.",1414540800,3,1668,4.911347517730497

But this movie - and it's precursor - are absolutely stunning in their execution, the timing, the tempo, the music score and the choice of actors. Whether the main players or supportive cast, everyone associated with these movies portrays their role well. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto - already established by the first Star Trek movie as amazing in time-proven roles - are joined by Cumberbatch, who so convincingly portrays Kahn that it gives even someone whose seen all the old movies & tv series a new understanding of the complexity of that particular persona.

I'm not a huge fan of sci-fi as a general rule, but I've found this movie absolutely engrossing as few are these days. It's clear that a lot of thought, planning and careful execution went into this project - and the result is undeniably amazing.",1414281600,,1034,4.7444444444444445

5286878,3,B009934S5M,The new Treks are far too action oriented. TOS had stories and character development. Besides Ricardo Montalbano is KAHN and no one else. No offense to Crum-whateverhis name is because he is a terrific actor but the script allowed no development for him to work with. IMHO,1414022400,2,272,4.808510638297872
5286879,4,B009934S5M,nice to see all the star trek crew when they were young makes u understand how they got that way later although most start on the small screen when young then get a movie deal they must have found a time warp of there own,1414022400,,221,3.933333333333333
5286880,4,B009934S5M,"Well done. I'd heard people complain how bad it was and so had never made an effort to see it- but it was well done. Of course there is the whole explosion building on explosion headset that gets a bit silly at times- and one has to resign oneself to fist fights with super humans that somehow don't permanently hurt the non-super humans- lots of tossing people about in extended fight scenes - but if you can set aside your Vulcan need for logic, it is a fun popcorn movie.",1414022400,,474,4.277777777777778

It is one of the few movies that is timeless and plays as well as it did the first time I saw it.

I love the way they're paralleling the old sequence. ST2 was ""The Wrath of Khan,"" so it was interesting how they got Khan into this second film in the new series. We also met Dr. Marcus, mother of Kirk's son, but in the original sequence, David never knew that Kirk was his father. Perhaps, in this new series, Kirk will be involved in his son's life from the very beginning.",1413849600,,512,4.457446808510638

5286988,4,B009934S5M,"This movie is good, and it is worth getting it. Now for the Star Trek fan like me this movie is good to just see for fun but it isn't that great. It is a lot of action, more militaristic, it is not too focused on the characters compared to past Star Trek movies. The first Star Trek movie is 10x better than this one but you shouldn't expect so much since J.J. Abrams was never a fan of Star Trek. Star Trek always had a philosophical feel to it and focused more the relationships with the crew. I give J.J. Abrams credit for reviving the interest of this beloved franchise but Star Trek deserves a movie made by a true fan. I enjoyed Star Trek First Contact  more than Into Darkness.

5286990,4,B009934S5M,This movie is the second in the newest version of the Start Trek universe. This combines a version in which JTK's father died as JTK is born and the Vulcan home world is destroyed before Spock finishes SFA; as the original Spock watches having been brought back from the past. We also get to see Kahn. In all is an excellent movie.,1413763200,,331,4.354838709677419
5287001,3,B009934S5M,"Interesting and pretty good story, but some of the characters' actions and the way some technology did/didn't work didn't add up.  I like sci fi and understand giving leeway to the characters and how things happen in context, but the characters' decisions and behaviors need to be consistent with who they are and how the story shows that the technology is supposed to work.  The characters in the original Star Trek and Next Generation seem more intelligent, professional, believable, etc... overall.  This movie and the characters seemed a little dumbed down and unnecessarily over dramatized, even considering that they're younger and less mature versions of Captain Kirk and others.",1413676800,2,686,5.275229357798165

Over all, the acting is fine, but nothing special--until Benedict Cumberbatch appears.  He plays Khan, played on TV's Star Trek and in an earlier Star Trek film by Ricardo Montalban.  Cumberbatch's intelligent, focused acting elevates the film.  His carriage is elegant and his voice is rich.  He brings a dignity to the villain that the wholesome, good-guy characters lack.

You may have a keeper, if you're a Trekie, an early  release in 2013 with this unique take that got past hundreds involved. it is even interpreted by the brains of many Trekies (who expect a correct audio) as ""Kahn,"" even when the audio, in this particular distribution, is ""Khai.""

That's ""Star Trek Into Darkness"". I've been a Trek fan since watching the first broadcast episode in 1966. This is, to me, the worst of all the movies, even falling below ""Star Trek V"", the one Shatner directed.  In fact, of the Original Series, it rivals ""Spock's Brain"" for itsquality.

Starfleet NEVER had covers of any sort. The whole movie was a mutated version of a great movie that just insulted every person involved with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan as either involved in production and/or viewers. This movie had hardly anything that was true Star Trek. I mean, seriously? Did you really claim that there are no similarities between the original movie and this, J.J. Abrams? This was Wrath of Khan tossed into a blender with ""Younger stars"". Nothing even remotely unique. I'm only watching these movies just to ensure that I see everything so I can make an informed statement. If you have no interest or connection with the original Star Trek universe, then this movie is a good one. And if you don't mind physics being launched out the nearest airlock, once again, this movie is good. But if you grew up with the original Star Trek universe or know anything about stellar physics, pass this movie by. This will anger or disappoint you with malicious fervor and leave you screaming something like, ""Death to Abrams!""",1413504000,2,1197,4.732057416267943
5287100,5,B009934S5M,"STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS [2013] [3D Blu-ray + 2D Blu-ray + Digital Copy] [UK Release] Exciting Action-Packed Adventure! Earth Will Fall!

The 2013 best-rated blockbuster is nothing short of spectacular [Empire]. When a ruthless mastermind known as Khan [Benedict Cumberbatch] declares a one-man war on the Federation. Captain Kirk [Chris Pine], Spock [Zachery Quinto], and the daring crew of the USS Enterprise, set out on their most explosive manhunt of all time. It will take everything in their arsenal to defend Earth and eliminate Khans deadly threat in J.J. Abrams exhilarating blockbuster.

FILM FACT Part One: Awards and Nominations: 2013 Hollywood Film Festival Awards: Won: Best Hollywood Film for Star Trek: Into Darkness. 2014 Academy Awards: Nominated: Best Visual Effects for Burt Dalton, Ben Grossmann, Roger Guyett and Patrick Tubach. 2014 BAFTA Awards: Nominated: Best Special Visual Effects for Burt Dalton, Ben Grossmann, Roger Guyett and Patrick Tubach. 2014 MTV Movie Awards: Nominated: Best Villain for Benedict Cumberbatch.

FILM FACT Part Two: With Star Trek: Into Darkness, George Takei, who originated the role of Hikaru Sulu and appeared in Star Trek films and TV episodes, says, where Benedict Cumberbatch played Khan, I thought was unfortunate. Benedict Cumberbatch is a wonderful actor. I love everything that hes done, but if he was going to be playing that character, J.J. should have made him an original character that's singular to him. Because the Khan character first appeared in our TV series, ""Space Seed"" and Ricardo Montalban was sensational in our second movie  he was the title character, The Wrath of Khan, you know! The other thought that Gene Roddenberry always had in the back of his mind, and that was his philosophy, was to embrace the diversity of this planet.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In 1990, STAR TREK creator Gene Roddenberry told the L.A. Times ""there's a good chance that when I'm gone, others will come along and do so well that people will say, Oh, that Roddenberry, he was never this good."" Casual audiences might agree, but for the many lifelong STAR TREK fans like me, J.J. Abram's franchise revival opened up an interesting opportunity, especially as it fast approaching 50 years of age, but hardly represents a return to form for the core STAR TREK ethos; its philosophical ideals and the promise of a brighter future and in direct contravention of a film entitled STAR TREK: Into Darkness. Three years on from the 2009's franchise reboot, whose plot created an alternate timeline allowing the film to take certain liberties with established scenario and morph into its own version of Trek, J.J. Abrams and company returned with STAR TREK: Into Darkness.

Following a suicide blast at Starfleet HQ and subsequent aerial attack resulting in the murder of Starfleet commanders masterminded by turncoat Starfleet agent John Harrison [Benedict Cumberbatch], the Enterprise crew headed by Captain James T. Kirk [Chris Pine] are re-commissioned to mount a mission to kill Harrison on Kronos, the Klingon home world. Kirk refuses to accept orders at face value and decides to take John Harrison hostage. After a brief battle, John Harrison unexpectedly gives himself up, willingly boarding the Enterprise as a prisoner. Unfortunately, it's quickly revealed that neither the mission, nor John Harrison are quite as expected, when the crew of the Enterprise finds itself in the middle of a much larger plot of grave danger.

For the uninitiated, STAR TREK circa 2013 is an entertaining science fiction adventure, which commands viewers' attention right from the opening scenes. But saddling itself with the name STAR TREK automatically attaches 50 years of baggage, and that does this film no favours at all. The truth is this modern incarnation of the STAR TREK franchise, has little in common with it older STAR TREK siblings. STAR TREK has always gladly worn its heart on its sleeve with the epitaph of 'thinking man's sci-fi', but ruminating about the plot only reveals the numerous holes that riddle the script, not least the mind messing alternate timeline, which try as I might to explain to women who are not interest in sci-fi films, which I really struggled to do so.

In true J.J. Abrams fashion, there's a few surprises, but perhaps the worst kept is that of the true identity of the mysterious John Harrison and he is Khan Noonien Singh from both the Original Series episode 'Space Seed' and the feature film The Wrath of Khan. But Khan was never an Englishman, nor does Benedict Cumberbatch even remotely resembles Ricardo Montalban and try explaining that to newcomers and that is part of the whole problem with this particular STAR TREK film. It tries to be all things to all people and it just doesn't make a lick of sense. Why try and shoehorn STAR TREK lore into a film and then not even attempt to make it cohesive? For every cameo by a tribble or inflection of a classic phrase, we have another franchise contradiction or out of character motivation.

I hope for future STAR TREK franchise films that J.J. Abrams will now slink off from the franchise that he's revealed he was never a fan of, leaving the gates open for someone else to take the reins. I can only hope that that person will stay true to the core ethos of STAR TREK, rather than continue to churn out what amounts to, admittedly entertaining, but otherwise generic science fiction action, trading on the basis of STAR TREK's branding.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Originally released in cinemas in the 2013, the transfer for the film is presented in its original aspect ratio of 2.40:1 in a stunning 1080p encoded image. I was so excited to view it 3D, which I viewed in the cinema and was totally disappointed, as it was the worst 3D I have seen it in the cinema, but viewing it in this stunning 3D Blu-ray and it was definitely a fantastic very wild ride. The film has a lot of pop to it when it comes to a number of the action sequences and several moments where things are thrown out at the viewer. The layered look is used quite often throughout it as there are a good number of natural moments for it, but there are also a few where it just feels forced. The action scenes make the most use of it and it feels the most natural there while I found some of the standing around and talking in the 3D moments a bit disappointing. But these are few and far between, instead leaving me with a film that definitely engaged and was made fun by the 3D. The transfer captures this well and a look at the 2D side shows a strong attention to detail, colour definition and quality. The presentation across the board just works really well and made the purchase of it worthwhile.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The main track for this release is the 7.1 Dolby TrueHD mix and its one that does a very strong job overall as theres a good deal of directionality throughout it. Because of the direction used and the way the camera weaves and moves throughout all of the action, theres a lot going on even in the quiet scenes quite often, so the rear channels get a lot of activity throughout it and the forward soundstage has a strong and immersive feeling to it. The swell of the music is one of the bigger parts of it as it works in conjunction with the visuals beautifully as it goes for the large, epic moments, but the film has some very good quiet moments of incidental music as well that definitely adds to the overall flavour of it all. The mix is one that definitely has summer blockbuster written all over it and its transition to home video works very, very well.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Creating the Red Planet [1080p] [8:28] Cast and crew discuss ditching the idea of shooting in Hawaii and share the painstaking details behind creating Nibiru, both the leafy red surface and the volcanic set piece. The supplement also examines alien design and the technical details and challenges behind shooting the sequence.

Special Feature: Attack on Starfleet [1080p] [5:25] A look at the dramatic undertones behind one of the film's most critical scenes. It also studies set design, technical details behind the making of the scene, and creating the explosive action elements and the corresponding stunt work.

Special Feature: The Klingon Home World [1080p] [7:30] An examination of incorporating Klingons into the film, keeping them familiar but also making them unique to this universe, construction of the Kronos set, Klingon costume design and makeup, and coaching the actors in the Klingon language.

Special Feature: The Enemy of My Enemy [1080p] [7:30] An examination of incorporating Klingons into the film, keeping them familiar but also making them unique to this universe, construction of the Kronos set, Klingon costume design and makeup, and coaching the actors in the Klingon language.

Special Feature: Ship to Ship [1080p] [6:03] Creating one of the film's most daring action sequences, from pre-visualisation to final product. The supplement also examines shooting the end of the scene with no major digital enhancements.

Special Feature: Brawl by the Bay [1080p] [5:44] Shooting some of the climactic scenes in Los Angeles, Zachary Quinto's physical preparations for his role, and stunt double work.

Finally, the 3D generally really adds greatly to the feature in a welcome way to give it more pop and engagement while not coming across as wholly gimmicky or problematic. Its definitely one more in the slow but steady stream of 3D Blu-ray presentation. This film has had some criticism about this franchise for a variety of reasons, though they all get a lot of criticism for many, many other reasons, but as the second instalment of this timeline STAR TREK franchise, Im very pleased by the results and I am hopeful that a third instalment is produced faster than this one and without J.J. Abrams. Maybe it is time for a different pair of hands to see where STAR TREK can boldly go next time into the future? But despite some negative reviews of this film, but instead I am so pleased to add this to my STAR TREK Blu-ray Collection, as it gives me a great thrill every time I view these STAR TREK films on the Blu-ray format and especially in the stunning 3D image. Highly Recommended!

I never thought I would say this, but I think the new movies are much better than the old series or movies. The characters were preserved, right down to the funny jabs between McCoy and Spock. The graphics are extraordinary, in fact it's kinda hard to believe we watched the old series after seeing these. I waited 2 years to actually see the new Trek films, assuming they would stink.

I guess JJ Abrams either never bothered to get a technical advisor or just proceeded to ignore any technical advice he got.

But I did enjoy all the twists and the bringing in parts of other Star Trek movies and videos. the CGI effects were very good and the acting as well. Since the first movie changed the timelines all the changes in characters makes sense more-or-less. It will be interesting to see in the third movie whether they can bring things back to the regular time line we're all used to.

5287327,5,B009934S5M,"Absolutely love the Star Trek re-boot.  This is the best of the two movies produced so far.  More intense and a deeper story than J.J. Abrams first attempt, although cast and storyline were pretty darn good on that one too.  This cast is phenomenal in both remaining true to their Star Trek personas of the original series as well as making the effort to develop an identity for the latest rendition of each of these timeless characters.  I would like to have seen a little more depth in the history of the Kahn character for this new re-boot.  The character, for the most part, stands on its own, but there's a rich history for this character available, and if you're new to the franchise, and you've not seen the originals, you'll miss some fabulous story lines featuring a treacherous villain.  A villain the producers have seen the necessity to feature in a full TV episode and two major motion pictures.  At least in Star Trek Two, The Wrath of Kahn, a viewer had learned, via a whole episode of the TV series, the character and history of Kahn well before the movie was released.  It would have been nice to see just a few scenes introducing this new audience to Kahn and the crew of the infamous Botany Bay.",1412726400,,1214,4.511415525114155

MANY other stories should have been gone after, rather than a story that had already been done successfully by Ricardo Montalban. Cannot improve upon a story that many (including me) believed was the best Trek ever.

How about exploring other locales besides earth? Personally, I would have loved to see the Tholians or some place NEW, somewhere we'd never gone before. After all, isn't part of Enterprise's mission to ""seek out NEW life and NEW civilizations?

If you are looking for a Enterprise full of genius level rule breakers you are buying the wrong movie. The first puzzle being solved by the crew sets the tone. Why park a Starship in an ocean when you are flying a shuttle into a volcano?  Can the shuttle not be launched from space?  Why not park your ship directly above the volcano incase you need line of sight to beam someone out if an emergency situation arises. Why not just beam the device into the volcano for that matter?  The decisive battle taking place at the end is just 250,000 miles from Earth disabling both ships yet they make it to Earth in just a few minutes, but take hours falling to their doom. If you really are that close to Earth wouldn't there be hundreds of shuttles and Transporters to help the troubled ships?

So it is not too difficult for me to enjoy a much younger cast.  I think they did a good job matching the voices and mannerism's with the original characters.  It did catch me off guard a few times when one actor would speak and I had to make the connection that the young face I am looking at is supposed to be Scott, or Kirk or whomever.

I love Star Trek for its more cerebral elements, NOT for fist-fights and space battles.  JJ Abrams is a fine director, but this felt like nothing more than a """"""""Star Trek"""""""" logo smacked onto an otherwise lackluster ""space adventure"" a la Star Wars I-III with the seemingly expressed purpose of satisfying the popcorn-eating cows.  It took me FIVE different viewings to finally finish this film.
For a man who grew up watching TNG and loving almost every minute of it (the Riker flash-back episode in season 1 was terrible) due to the brilliance of the diplomatic, deliberate, and insightful socio-political themes that Picard handled like the genius that he is, this movie was essentially a swift kick to my balls.  It was so bad that I have to award this turd a 1/5 star rating, something I've never done before.  If you actually like Star Trek, and are more interested by things intellectual (rather than 'splosions and fist fights), avoid this like the plague.

5287797,4,B009934S5M,"In this second instalment of the Star Trek reboot launched by J.J. Abrams, our favourite characters from the first Star Trek movie go once again on a fast-paced action adventure facing an old adversary with a new face, while facing the 'darkness' that lies in the heart of Starfleet itself.

Overall I enjoyed this movie - while the acting was not brilliant, the science is often laughable (the Enterprise for example moves from a lunar orbit 235,000km from Earth to plunging into the atmosphere in a matter of seconds following a power failure), the plot is often thin and lacking in originality (the key surprise is not really a surprise) and one often feels Abrams tried to pack too much material into a short time frame while keeping the audience wowed with non-stop action and special effects.

Admittedly the film does have some 'wow' moments - the Warp battle scene involving the Vengeance and the Enterprise and the 'crash' sequence being good examples.  But generally I was disappointed with the film - the allusions to terrorism, the corrupting effects of violence and power, and the appeal to nobler motives of people were so thinly veiled as to be almost predictable, while the film lacked the sense of freedom, adventure and wonder that characterised the original series and the new reboot movie.  The plot, while competently executed was lamentably predictable, the acting somewhat wooden (especially Zachary Quinto's attempts to show emotion and lack thereof) and the special effects were average to annoying (do we really need lens flares?).  Anyone familiar with Trek would know in the first ten minutes exactly how this film would unfold, and in my view, intelligent ones could work it out even from watching just the pre-release promotional material.

The film is ultimately saved from being mediocre by good effects and the generally highly competent acting from the stars, particularly (and surprisingly) those in supporting roles, such as John Cho (Sulu) and Zoe Saldana (Uhura).  Unfortunately the introduction of Dr Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) was completely bungled - there is no hint of romance or emotional chemistry between her and Kirk (yet she is supposed to become the mother of his son) and her character just seems to be there for mere 'eye candy.'

While the film was a commercial success, one hopes the next movie in the series will show more originality and take on new territory, instead of just rehashing old tropes and themes covered well enough in the existing Trek franchises.",1410307200,,2514,5.011990407673861
5287798,1,B009934S5M,"Two objections. First, the movie portrays drinking alcohol and sexual promiscuity as something ""real men"" do. Sorry, but there's no hope in those notions. Second, it presents death as something to be feared, overlooking the fact that Jesus Christ conquered Satan and death and those who have faith in Him have no fear of death because they know where they're going. Satan is the Prince of this world and death is his ultimate weapon against men and women.",1410307200,,455,4.846153846153846

5287812,5,B009934S5M,"I think JJ Abrams did an excellent, and almost unbelievable, casting of crew members so close to the original characters.  Especially for Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock!  I have been a Star Trek fan from the very beginning in the 1960's, and I was surprised by the Next Generation and the fact that I ended up absolutely loving the new characters.  I had quite a lot of doubt at the ""re-boot"" of the original characters and didn't watch it when it first came out.  Much to my surprise, AGAIN, I found the characters and paralleling story lines to the original, but with a twist due to a time line shift, absolutely well-done and addicting...can't wait for the next installment, which this one was.  It too, was done flawlessly.  I can only hope that the next one, WITHOUT JJ Abrams, holds up to the standard he has set with these first two movies.

You really get a feeling for the steel inside Hikaru Sulu, and Uhura is brainy, brave, and beautiful. A possible going-forward love interest is even set up between Kirk and the gorgeous physicist Dr. Carol Marcus for the next movie. Futuristic London and San Francisco are of course fantastic.

5287865,1,B009934S5M,"Chase, explosion, chase, explosion, wink, nod, chase, explosion. The characters are two-dimensional cut-outs. The writing is daft. For hardcore Trek fans, the film tramples on series canon. Suddenly Kirk doesn't discover Khan in deep space on his ship, the Botany Bay. Suddenly Christopher Pike was never horrifically disfigured in a freak training accident, and he never returns to Talos. If you are doing a film in a hallowed series, you have a responsibility to research that series, honor what has come before, and extend its tradition of excellence. This film utterly fails to do that.

J.J. Abrams is not a director, he's an event planner--for five year old birthday parties. I shudder to think what he will do to Star Wars and only hope Kathleen Kennedy wrangles him in a more sophisticated direction.",1409702400,5,808,5.075187969924812

5287874,3,B009934S5M,"JJ Abrams has done what many have done recently: take an old franchise and Reboot it, and decently! There are many examples like Batman and James Bond. You see the thing is, it's much easier to Reboot a franchise rather than make a traditional sequel. Ah, the reputation of sequels is so bad! Just Reboot, way easier to make something the people will like.

This version of Star Trek is not bad. It doesn't have the same depth as the original series, but I'd say it definitely outdoes some of the original movies (maybe not all of them, though). Of course, it's made for my generation, which is another reason why Reboots do better than sequels. You can Reboot the whole universe and make its culture like our culture. You have much more freedom in a Reboot.

I don't think the super-young crew is a great idea, though. Way too young to be plausible that Kirk keeps getting the captain's chair. I mean jeeze that Kirk looks 19 years old. I had to look up Chris Pine, hes' over 30. Don't see why they couldn't have made them a little older. My generation would have still turned out to see this movie.

The humor is not bad. A lot of time it's right on the nose. There's also great dialogue where the humor comes from knowing their personalities and their at-odds stances, rather than a punchline. But it gets old or dumb, like Kirk's line about ""bedside manner"" while flying towards Harisson's ship.

One thing I heard was that the undressing scene with Carol and Kirk was gratuitous and unnecessary, and that Abrams actually made an apology about this.

Well, maybe it's unnecessary, sure, but compare that to the 2009 Star Trek where we see Uhura actually take off her clothes for like a minute. Much more gratuitous. ""Into Darkness"" is an improvement in that realm, cuz it's only 2 seconds we see Carol. I don't think you need sexual scenes to make a good movie and/or sell it.

Another thing think I noticed was that their uniforms are still very, very plain. Basically, they are plain v-neck t-shirts with seams. Now, I'm not asking for shoulder epaulets and dressing them up like canaries, as many militaries do these days, but there's gotta be a way to make those uniforms more detailed while still obeying the simplex concept. Put some colored squares, medals, ribbons, a few hats for the officers, maybe some chevrons identifying rank, stuff like that. As it is, the plain t-shirt just makes them look all the more younger/casual, which translates to implausibility for me.

There's a little too much team-fighting for my taste. The crew is just so at odds with each other, always on the knife-edge of deciding one way or another, yelling back and forth about what's the best thing to do. You just wanna pull your hair out because this stuff happens at the dumbest times in the middle of a firefight or other emergency, worst time for team breakdown.

But at least everyone stays in-character 90% of the time (for this movie, not comparing to original Star Trek). Spock in particular saying of miracles, ""There are no such things,"" is a good movie-moment. But then a few scenes later he emotionally screams ""Khaaan!!!"" ??? Bad way to break the rules of his character. It's the most overused, hackneyed ""NOOOO!"" moment used in almost every literature and movie, cheezy... Good grief, just let the music say ""No!"" instead.

The crew personalities are okay, but they become too hackneyed as time goes on. Bones in particular is always doing the same thing: harping on Spock, disagreeing with every course Kirk wants to take, and ending with a metaphor. We need to see more of the crew doing their part so that it's really an ensemble cast. As it is, it's more of a 2-star cast with most time on Kirk and Spock.

There's nothing wrong with the computer graphics...except at the beginning (which is the worst time to be bad, bad first impression). Can't really put my finger on it, but the zoom-in on that red world looks really fake, like it's a model and the camera moves relatively too fast around it.

btw, about CG and action, many people always say something to the effect of, ""it was good action, good graphics"", like at least it has this and was fun. This doesn't matter to me anymore, because pretty much every movie has them. It's become cheap---not bad quality cheap, because the action and CG is fine...just the cheapness of abundance, like talk is cheap. Every movie these days has decent action sequences. The challenge of a good movie is to have something more.

So does ""Into Darkness"" meet this challenge? A little bit, yes, in my opinion anyway, but at the same time there are many points where I see it could be better, and wish it were so...and wonder why they didn't see it as well. The thing about Star Trek is, the original episodes were more about Human values and problems, not technology. It can be hard to see that, because on the surface Star Trek is definitely Sci Fi hi tech. JJ Abram's versions also have some message, but not as much. Basically, the message of this movie is the dangers of a standing military, as well as exploring the dichotomy between human feeling/instinct and logic/science. That's why Kahn and his crew didn't die, but were just put back to sleep---the dangers of militaristic extremism are always there. But the movie is 90% action/humor and 10% artful message.

Bottom line, it's easier to make a Reboot than a sequel. It's ironic because i think this 2011 sequel is a bit better than the 2009 one. Nevertheless, I'm sure this version will one day be Rebooted itself, hehe.",1409616000,2,5533,4.64519427402863

5287953,5,B009934S5M,"I'm a big fan of the ""Star Trek"" brand (thank you Gene Roddenberry R.I.P.) but I find it challenging to beat out the original Captain Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy) et al;

That was until the latest crew came onto the scene in 2009 and with J.J. Abraham's masterful touch, this new ""Trek"" looks to be as good as the original. Of course technology plays a big role as they just couldn't create then what they can create now but still......

Anyway, when you watch Chris Pike play the role of a young James Tiberius Kirk or Zachary Quinto play a masterful ""Spock"". All of a sudden I am 10 years old again and watching the weekly series that kept us so spell bound as kids. The movie has grossed $467 million, making it the most successful movie in the entire series of all Star Treks. I believe that speaks volumes.... We rented the movie and then immediately bought the movie to put into our library. You will too!

Believe the subtle twists of original cast Star Trek's history will provide room to grow franchise and move in yet unexplored directions.  New producers setting stage to ""Boldly go where Star Trek hasn't gone before"".  In this program, we are reintroduced to Kahn in all his savagery and cunning.  In fact he was awaken to guide development of weapons and strategies to meet and overcome Klingon threat.  The story moves along with solid pace, excellent action, wonderful character interplay, subtle and intelligent redirection and all to great and somewhat unexpected finale. (In the new Star Trek we conceive a universe where Kirk never pitches Priceline.com.)  Characters well developed with wonderful exchanges - only Checkov underused but there's always the next project!. Only small, miniscule negative was corny use of opening refrain.

While I loved the original t.v. series and movies, these two were fun, fresh and comforting at the same time.  The actors and actresses were phenomenal at capturing our beloved ST cast which kept them comforting.  Going back to the beginning on how the crew was formed was fresh and of course, all the phasers on stun, warp speeds, blowing up ships and different aliens kept it fun as well as comforting.  I've said it before, I'll say it again:  I don't hold to Cannon so the discrepancies diehard STers might be finding are minimal to me and do not take away from the familiarity of ""Boldly going where no man has gone before.""  I've seen some books that were turned into movies and were horrible and one set of prequels of a different franchise (I'll just say S.W)  that left my teeth on edge.

5288305,2,B009934S5M,"The more I think about it, the less I like it, for several reasons.  First, it wasn't a Star Trek movie in the classic sense, it was a newfangled, glitz and flash action movie with the Star Trek logo.  If not for the star ships It could have just as easily been ""Mission Impossible"".  Very little character development and every non-action scene was just a setup for the next action scene.

Second, the bits they used from an earlier ST movie just didn't work for me.  SPOILER ALERT: SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS!  Maybe the writers thought repurposing Spock's death scene in Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan with the roles reversed would appeal to Trekkies as a neat twist, but to me it came off as unoriginal, plagiaristic, and not at all respectful of one of the most powerful and poignant scenes in all of Star Trek lore.  The scene with the new Capt. Kirk's plea to ""take me and spare my crew"" came straight out of STII:WoK as well.  And the idea for using Khan's genetically modified blood to save Kirk came from an episode of Battlestar Galactica where blood from a hybrid human/cylon infant was used to cure the President's terminal cancer.  There were other obvious borrows from earlier ST work, but by now you get the point.

Watch this move with STII:WoK back to back and you'll see the difference between a great movie and just another action flick, albeit a well-done one.  STII:WoK spends a good amount of time setting up the story, developing the characters, and revealing subplots.  About the only thing that passes for a subplot in ST:ID is the revelation that Dr. Marcus, who more or less stowed away on the Enterprise, is the villain Admiral's daughter.  And that is gone in an instant when she's beamed off the Enterprise to her father's ship.

Third, even the action is pretty much straightforward bang bang shoot 'em up.  STII:WoK relied *much* more on wit and guile to set up the action scenes.  The two scenes where Kirk outright tricked Khan were ""Oh, hell yeah!"" moments and the final battle scene where Kirk uses ""3-dimensional thinking"" to get the jump on Khan and destroy his ship was as suspenseful and ultimately satisfying as anything I've seen in sci-fi.  In ST:ID, the action was very predictable, very little in the way of setup, you know what's coming and how it will end.  Nothing new, we've seen it all before in J.J.  Abrams' other action work.

So, a good sci-fi action flick?  Yes, with all the dazzling special effects and over-the-top fight scenes we've come to expect from J.J.  and his contemporaries.  A good Star Trek movie?  No.  It does none of the deeper exploration of social issues, and very little of the character development, subplots, and well-thought-out action sequences we came to expect from earlier ST movies.  If this is what the Star Trek franchise has become, I'll be much happier watching reruns.  Given how much it borrowed from earlier work, this one was almost a rerun itself.",1407110400,5,2951,4.679611650485437

5288328,3,B009934S5M,"I love Star Trek. I love the reboot idea, too, and how the history is changed from the original series. The first film in this new series was great. Four stars.

This second outing has problems. Spoiler Alert - do not read if you don't want to know...

The first major problem is this: A secret facility is blown up. A meeting of top brass is arranged... without appropriate security protections - knowing there is a terrorist involved, and a very smart and clever one at that. So, of course, the bad guy blows the crap out of the meeting and kills a lot of important people.

Second: And only Kirk seems to have any idea about doing something to end the carnage, with not one person seeing his actions and pitching in? Seriously?

Third: The big bad starship plunges to earth in the last act. ""Nobody could survive that (crash)."" I quite agree. Even Khan could not have survived the g-force impacts. The physics say, not going to happen. He's dead, Jim. But, no, the plot device demands Khan survive. Fine, I can live with that because I'm willing to let them stretch the plausible, even making some improbables possible. But...

Fourth: Spock and Khan are fighting. Fair enough. But now they're fighting on top of a fast moving vehicle. Well, okay, flashback to the Westerns and train top fights. However, now we jump the shark... Khan leaps to another fast moving vehicle.... and Spock also makes the leap in pursuit.

Here is where I just shook my head and found myself so disappointed. But wait, it gets better (??); Uhura beams down to the moving vehicle (something beyond difficult for transporter technology) and saves Khan's life.

*Sigh*

I'm all in favour of suspending my disbelief. I'm even quite willing to let some things go, even Khan surviving the crash. But the mid-air fight scene was a disaster.

Things have to be believable - even in fantasy universes - and stretching what is believable is fine, to a point. Past that point, and this film went beyond reason, you will lose me.

Okay, all that said, I still found the film reasonably enjoyable for the most part. It is the sophomore effort, and sophomore sequels often suffer ""lack"". I'm sure the third effort in this new franchise will redeem the series.... I hope.",1407024000,4,2238,4.657360406091371

So what we learned is that Spock can Fly, Kirk can die and then be revived and the star ship enterprise is damaged beyond repair but can still fly like nothing is wrong with it. We also have the ability to beam into other galaxies. So throw out all laws of physics and just blow stuff up. That is what this franchise has come down to. Very sad. I gave it a shot. I thought the first movie was OK... Not really keen on all the artistic upside down shots of the Enterprise and the overly dramatic reenactment of the original characters. This is my last Star Trek film until the next reboot. Hopefully they will find someone that understand it and actually enjoys it.",1406851200,8,816,4.203821656050955

Zach Quinto as Spock, who convincingly embodied the characters and voices of the key stars.  The plot was believable, although there were a couple of impossible occurrences such as Khan surviving the explosion of 100 photon torpedoes inside the same starship he was in.

5288477,4,B009934S5M,"Its good.. no point me going over what people have said already.. The main thing that bugged me was the wholly inaccurate science. I would of course say that as a science nerd, but its hard to enjoy a piece of the movie when the science is absurd and it could have easily been resolved.

i.e. (I will be as unspecific as possible to not spoil anything) a ship is 200000K from an earth like planet and loses power. Anyone with some basic astronomy will know it would take weeks for it to fall to the earth... In this movie, it suddenly beings to fall and the full strength of the Earths atmosphere is on the people within. Any toddler who has watched people in orbit knows this is nonsense just be watching a spacewalk.

Also, a character dies from a radiation overdose in about 2-3 minutes. This is absurd. Radiation kills you because it damages DNA, so when your body tries to create new proteins.. it cant... in other words, it would take days to die.

Also, a character is revived after being dead for about 15 minutes. Some basic biology tells us that bran damage starts after about 2 minutes.. it would be impossible to fix someones dead brain cells after this period, because once nerves die and they lose their connections, they cannot be fixed.

All of these could have been fixed easily.... Revive that character sooner, and allude to the possible brain damage. Have that ship lose power closer to the planet's surface (perhaps just in the sky above) to make it more believable, and kill that character in a different way.. perhaps he/she inhales some toxic chemicals or something.

I know it's a movie, I know I am supposed to suspend disbelief.. but when crucial plot points are based on a ridiculous situation it is hard to enjoy the 'story' so I began to lose my enjoyment towards the end.",1406419200,,1802,4.532307692307692

Captain Kirk continues to be a bungling, emotional child who fails at everything he does.  The storyline just straight up does not make sense. (Khan piloting an attack vehicle himself instead of a drone, then teleporting to another solar system to escape??; placing a communicator call to Scotty back on Earth from Klingon space??; people falling in the ship due to gravity when they are still in space above Earth??).  They have to call on old Spock to tell them WTF to do about Khan, and he just straight up tells them how to solve everything.

There were moments in this movie that were totally original from t he original story path.  I was amused that the change the order of those who die and live in course of this story.  It was interesting seeing Zachary Quinto playing a different kind of Vulcan that we're use to seeing.

I've heard so many rumors that they want to serialize this version of the Star Trek Universe and I almost wonder what Gene Roddenberry would think of what they've done and where they've gone with his original ideas.

This movie paints a wider canvas than the old series and makes for much less perfect characters which, of course, makes them more approachable and identifiable for viewers.  Though I didn't like the first movie so much, this second entry in the Star Trek (reboot) seems better developed.

5288590,1,B009934S5M,"It's fine if you're looking for a high-budget sci-fi movie with the depth of a TV episode stretched into movie form.  However, don't be fooled by the title, this movie barely even pretends to be in the Star Trek universe!

Shall I break down the lore-unfriendly absurdities?  (Yes, technically spoilers, although how this movie could be spoiled is truly beyond me.)

Apparently, it is possible to transport clear across the galaxy.  Why use warp then?  Who knows.
Oh wait, you can travel from the Klingon Empire to Earth, using old warp factor, in just a few minutes.  I guess it helps to bring a spaceship, that way you can crash it into stuff.
New Spock calls up old Spock (Nimoy), randomly, from another fracking time (no explanation given for this marvelous new technology), who proceeds to give utterly useless advice with absolutely no bearing on the plot whatsoever, just to give him face time.
Kirk KICKS a warp coil into place - now that's engineering!
Spock gets pissed off and goes on a violent rampage.  Vulcan, who?
A blood transfusion from Khan = resurrection.  Seriously, no more explanation than that.  Durrrr....

The Star Trek movies have seen some real POS's, and I can't say this was a worse movie than Final Frontier.  However, this is the first ""Star Trek"" movie ever made that just didn't care that it was supposed to be Star Trek!  One of the prevailing themes of the ST universe is that they at least TRY to make the science SOMEWHAT plausible, and... OK, wait, to make that last sentence believable, you're gonna have to forget movies IV and V. But at least those movies were just crap, they didn't completely ignore the basic characters and universe they were portraying!

I was honestly a bit hopeful about the first JJ Abrams reboot.  It was total re-envisioning, with some pointless Nimoy sighting, sure, but it wasn't disrespectful.  With this movie, its as if Abrams was forced to do something he didn't want to, and hacked together a script just to get it over with.  Anyway, here's hoping any future release will let Abrams go, and forget this disastrous, ludicrous farce.",1405900800,4,2106,4.773480662983426
5288591,1,B009934S5M,"It is hard to see how this movie could be any worse. Not because of the actors, they are perfectly cast. Not because of visuals or audio, they are fabulous. Well, except the notorious lens flares. Not because of the general storyline, this would have been a great movie or set of movies.

What is terrible is the direction and the way the plot slapsticks and jerks through inconsistent and unbelievable, badly thought out curves. JJ took the template of 90ies frat and racing movies and moved them into space. And they don't work, or, to be more precise, they can't work for an audience of thinking beings. This is a great movie for chimps, but homo sapiens sapientis struggles with suspending disbelief far enough. The dialogue attempts to cater to the sf crowd by injecting occasional science babble, but fails miserable to make any sense.

I shudder to think what is going to happen to the star wars franchise.",1405900800,4,913,4.7

5288621,5,B009934S5M,"I don't mind that JJ is messing with the timeline. Some would say this timeline was altered when the Borg landed on earth in ""First Contact"". That's how ""Enterprise"" is explained. Also, understanding the first two movies have been more about reintroducing the crew with a little action adventure thrown in for good measure. That said, my hope is Abrams will return to the morality plays outlined by Gene Roddenberry. The last thing I would like to see happen is that the reboots should continue with the ""Find the bad guy, kill the bad guy Trek movies"". As is the case with this and the first movie. That's not what Star Trek is about. If we are starting from the beginning or scratch, there is plenty of material in the Trek universe to be mined that tells a great story with action adventure and a lesson to be learned at the end. If you're looking for Star Wars,I understand JJ is working on that too!

a little more about the movie. SPOILER ALERT! This movie is more about the good old cowboy Kirk, ""Find the bad guy, kill the bad guy"" as mentioned above, or at least put him in stasis. One scene I appreciated the most was the role reversal between the Kirk and Spock characters. Only no Genesis planet this time, but fixed none the less. If you haven't seen the movie, my hope is not to give too much away.

OH! And why is it that the casting department can never find an east asian person to play that role. Are we stupid! Maybe you could have got away with in the Sixties. But this is 2014. I'm sure there are plenty of Indian or even Pakistani actors that would have love to playing this part. (I know! Don't want to steer the pot and make someone from that region of the world into a terrorist.) After all, they didn't kill him in the end, just put him back sleep.

Abrams wishes.  Still leaps and bounds better than ST-V: The Final Frontier.

As far as the physical copy of the film.  The case arrived in good condition only missing the outer paper sleeve w/ 3D cover.  A minor flaw in personal opinion but only because I love those 3D covers.  Not a deal breaker especially at the price.  The package also showed signs of a possible re-shrink wrapping and had no security sticker around the outer edge of the case.  Though with all of the appropriate discs inside and the proper UV digital code included it gave me little concern and could just as easily be chalked up to a bulk distributor with lax packaging standards.

It is basically a reprise of the Wrath of Khan with appropriate twists given that the time-line and series of events established in the earlier Star Trek series and movies is now been disrupted. This disruption gives the story writers a huge range of possibilities with the story lines. The actors are terrific. Close enough to pass themselves off as the younger versions of Capt. Kirk, Spock, Bone etc. but confident enough to make the roles their own.
I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Star Trek and action movies.",1405555200,,620,4.697247706422019
5288666,5,B009934S5M,"This is an awesome retelling of the Wrath of Kahn in the alternative timeline of the new movies.  Incredible action and special effects.  One of my favorite Sci-fi movies of all time along with the 2009 Star Trek!

5288667,2,B009934S5M,"Poor acting overall. The movie was rushed and predictable. Excessive special effects to the point of absurdity. Excessive pointless action. No depth. No connection between characters and audience. Star Trek: Into Darkness is worth watching only so you can appreciate how good they did on Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, and to see how old Leonard Nemoy looks now. I'm not against the idea of a reboot with something new, even if it's completely non-canonical, but at least make an effort. This is not a good movie.",1405555200,5,515,4.797752808988764

Kirk, Spock(s), Scotty was especially charming, Uhura was good, would have loved more of Bones and Chekov. But the plot holes are so large you can fly spaceships through them... and Abrams does.  SPOILER warnings.  Khan is upset about the murder of his family... but shouldn't someone point out that they were not murdered?  Shouldn't that ratchet down his fury a bit?  Khan is supposed to be at least 300 years old, but another date says it's now 2259.  So Khan was around in 1959?  Born only a few years after Watson and Crick figured out the basics with respect to DNA, and a couple generations before it was mapped?  It also seems amazingly convenient that Khan goes exactly where Marcus wants to start a war ... I guess he knew this, but Khan's logic escapes me.

Still, it was a lot of fun, and perhaps more logical than some of the time travel.  At least it was not time travel!",1405296000,,971,4.404494382022472

5288756,4,B009934S5M,"As a die hard Star Trek purist since the 1960s, there are aspects of this new adventure that just don't sit right for me. I really couldn't get into the first installment with these character portrayals at all.  Thus, the four stars instead of five.

If taken as a stand-alone story, however, the acting, writing and presentation is excellent. Benedict Cumberbatch is outstanding as Khan; I didn't think anyone could compare to Montalban, but Cumberbatch came about as close as one can get.

I'm still not crazy about either Pine or Quinto as Kirk and Spock. They just don't do it for me. And the whole Spock/Uhura thing? It doesn't work at all.

That said, I am giving a good solid four stars because the movie was very entertaining and it held my interest from opening to ending credits. I enjoyed the character play (if I didn't try to think of them as ""my"" Star Trek characters of old). Cumberbatch sealed it for me -- I'm starting to think that he plays ""mad"" better than any actor today, whether it is the semi-sociopathic genius of Sherlock Holmes, the lurking threat of Smaug or the genetically programmed evil of Khan.

Good movie, and I recommend it strongly ... as long as you don't cling too tightly to the fact that it's supposed to be Star Trek.",1405209600,2,1259,4.5777777777777775

Without ruining it too much, there are definitely some motifs from previous movies...several near-death experiences, several old villains making their return, several ""I saw that coming"" moments, and countless moments where Scotty 'needs more power!' (like always)

Blu ray disk was perfect, crystal clear audio and picture; however, and this could have been my disk only, the regular DVD disk had problems. It skipped in several places, at one time bringing me to the end of the movie then back to the beginning, and a minute later, the ending credits. Kept the disk and cleaned it, but with the same problem.

Overall, great movie..highly recommended for any Star Trek fan and movie enthusiast.

The great thing about good sic-fi is that it retains some human elements to make it somewhat reasonable for the audience to enter into the story. The original Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was incredible due to the impassioned crossed-paths of Kirk and Khan, and the performance of Ricardo Montalban. In this one, they don't even know each other, and by the end, I was on Khan's side. Also, if someone can transport anywhere now, why bother with space-ships?

For all his talent as a writer and director, JJ Abrams shows NO understanding of or respect for the Star Trek canon.

5288774,1,B009934S5M,"Terrible script writing or editing. Did not feel any connection with characters - no development. How could there be? The director had to spend all of his time attempting to hide his lack of skill and talent by using excessive (and quite silly) special effects. Same thing with directing the actors.  The acting, on a whole, was pathetic.  The only two quite decent performances were the Spock and the Khan characters who made their characters believable. Next best were the Sulu and Admiral Pike characters.  Otherwise, you had a Starship Captain that acted like an 8 yr old, Uhuru wanted nothing to do but have an (apparent lover's) argument with Spock, and the two over-the-top performances by Chekov who was some kind of hyper-manic incompetent boob who was going to come unglued any second, and Scotty as a complete, drunken (unfunny) idiot.

Even if you don't have a clue about the Star Trek franchise, this movie is nothing more than a special effects extravaganza with all the depth of kiddie pool. If you need something to provide background noise while cleaning the house, give this a view.  Otherwise, save yourself a couple hours of your life.",1405123200,24,1155,4.872448979591836

5288785,2,B009934S5M,"Even though the original series debuted well before I was born, I was a huge fan of the original star trek growing up and to this day it remains my favorite.  The next generation was too obvious in it's attempt to be politically correct which often gave a dishonest sort of feel to it and though the original series is lacking in PC qualities and certainly isn't perfect, I find its honesty and its honest portrayal of characters appealing.  Which is why I found the reboot so disappointing and this film is no different.  First of all the acting in this film is horrible.  The characters are reduced (or perhaps a better term is- overdone) to caricatures of themselves. The only actors who do a good job are Zoe Saldana as Uhura, and Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan and it is for them that I added an extra star.  These were the only performances that made the movie remotely worth it. John Cho and Quinto were ok as Spock and sulu... the rest were a complete joke. The characters of the original series are the richest, most distinct and perhaps the most complex of all in the star trek universe and yet what they are reduced to here is little more than a bunch of cute sayings and snippets that make them look like cartoon versions of themselves. The script didn't help matters. Many of the lines given to Spock were things that his character would never have said in his youth and the script tries too hard to pull heart strings without succeeding.  Somehow you end up feeling more empathy for Khan than for any of the good guys even when they are dying.  And then there are all the holes in the story which like in the first movie they don't bother to explain because they are hoping everyone watching is too dumb to look past the explosions to notice.  The only good thing about this reboot being done so poorly is that it opens the door for another much better reboot in the future.  This movie caters to the lowest denominator; people who just want to see things explode and punches thrown without caring about whether the actual movie/story is any good. Sure- everyone likes explosions every now and then; that's why we see the fireworks on the 4th of July, but they are the same every year; which is fine because it's only once a year so they are still special.  But with these types of movies it seems they are all the same and they come out with a whole lot of the same every year.  You would think with all the millions they throw at these films they could actually put some creative energy into it and make the audience walk away actually feeling something.  What's really sad is that with all the technological advancements in film since the original Khan movie, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" which came out before I was even born is BETTER than this reboot.  You feel more for the characters in that one.  In this reboot however, Khan and Uhura are the most engaging and interesting characters on screen which does not fair well considering the star is supposed to be Captain Kirk.  Overall it was a forgettable experience.",1405036800,6,3040,4.481884057971015

5288876,5,B009934S5M,"First, delighted that this was free on Amazon Prime. I had wanted to see it in the theaters since the trailer looked epic.  I've really enjoyed both the JJ Abrams Star Trek movies, feeling that they were fresh and fast-paced.  Into Darkness is over 2 hours long, but it never drags. And for all its special effects and roller coaster drama, it manages to at least hint at broader social commentary on interference in other cultures, vengeance versus justice, war, leadership, passion vs logic, friendship, power, ethics, etc.  Even though Star Trek fans are legendary for taking the show far to seriously, I'd still find a serious discussion of the themes in the movie ""fascinating.""",1404777600,,683,4.921739130434783
5288877,4,B009934S5M,"The new Star Trek films are a bit long on action and low on brain power. I would rate this as 3 stars except for the wonderful Benedict Cumberbatch (Khan) who lifts it up to maybe 3.75 stars. This film has plot holes big enough to fly a starship through. The great graphics and action sequences will probably be enough to impress those not familiar with the Star Trek canon and ethos, but I expect that long time Trekkers will roll their eyes at the ""act first, think rarely"" antics of the young Jim Kirk, and especially at the utterly unbelievable villainy of certain high ranking Star Fleet officers. Anyway, if you shut off your brain and enjoy the explosions, this is a 3. If you love Benedict, this is maybe a 3.5 or so. If you don't like action movies with massive explosions and even bigger plot holes, and you aren't into sci-fi in general or Star Trek in particular, this might even be a 1 or a 2.

5288918,5,B009934S5M,"This is an exciting film, well set, innovative, logical, and the storyline follows from start to finish in a realistic manner. It is what I would expect of the Star Trek movies. The film takes us form the beginnings of the young Trekors, with the original characters in their development stage; and each character manifested as the same later characters one will recognize developing over time. One scene grabbed me; the scene where Kirk entered the high radiation core area and then dies, with Spock outside peering into the room - which was later portrayed in the reverse. one cannot but help becoming deeply involved in such films as this, even if you're not a Treky, but to continue with the series and the films developed form it, indeed is a never-ending story. I find it interesting to compare the original series props with what now appears to be more highly developed props; as I can remember the first ""rocket-ship"" films where there were all sorts of older pressure faucets and gauges, some really funky stuff, when that's all that one could imagine or that we had available. Ha! But now, with computer technology, and a great imagination, we can make more films like this one and go where no man has gone before!",1404604800,,1224,4.724299065420561

5288923,1,B009934S5M,"Benedict Cumberbatch did a great job with bad lines and a horrid attempt to rein vision a classic villain whos only similarity to the original was that he woke up.  The rest is a light show.  If I wanted to see lights and pretty youths moving around quickly Id take drugs at a rave.

If you leave a Star Trek movie saying, ""That was awesome, dude!"" then it probably wasn't a good Star Trek movie.  If you leave a Star Trek movie with a lifted heart, and a feeling a hope for the human race, and then engage in an intellectual dialogue about the moral and ethical conflicts and the theories posed in the film... then Walla.

There's Dino Transformers 4 and Die Hard 5.  There's enough seizer inducing, effects driven, paper-thin characters with perfect bone structures pooping one-liners in place of plots.  Let Star Trek remain intelligent social commentary.

I can see JJ and the Hollywood Suits looking at Star Trek source material and putting this movie together in a day.

Suit: What do we do with Kahn, hes an icon?

JJ: Put him in a trench coat.

Suit: What do we do with the Enterprise in this one?

JJ: Uh crash it into a building?

Suit:  Star Trek is in space JJ.

JJ: Whatever, Ill find a way.

Suit: What do we do with the whole Spock repressing his emotions?

JJ: We won't and give him a girlfriend.

Suit: If we are pulling scenes from The Wrath of Kahn how do we make that famous death scene better?

JJ: Well make the other guy die and bring him back in 20 minutes.  I don't want the audience to have a lingering emotional state or anything.

Suit: Wow, you're a genius Mr. Abrams.  Do you want to direct the next Star Wars?

JJ:  Hell yeah!  Lets get started as fast as possible.

I would tell Mr. JJ to leave Star Trek alone, but he already has, departing with glee from a universe he admittedly didn't like or understand to add lens flare to a light saber.",1404604800,13,1875,4.3314121037463975

Love the cameo of our original Spock, Leonard Nimoy. What a wonderful tie-in to the first series. And what a great Kahn! Certainly not the acting chops of Ricardo Montalban, but well done in this completely action oriented remake.

5288948,2,B009934S5M,"Into the Darkness is everything Star Trek was never meant to be.  I'm a casual viewer, not a Trek fanatic, but even at that level, this film seemed abrasive to everything that its meant to build upon.  Its all video-game action with little concern about developing anything resembling a storyline.  Its fast moving but there isn't really any point to it moving along at any speed.  If it weren't part of a franchise, the film would quickly collapse as it doesn't have much of a foundation to make it worthwhile.  This is masked as its a reboot that tries to break away from the old material while concurrently trying to remind you that its deeply rooted in the same material its trying to ignore.  This is the real problem.  It wants to boldly go where no man has gone before but does so by tip-toeing in bunny slippers.

The original cast of these characters were all, in my opinion, only average actors, Nimoy and Takei notwithstanding, but they had amazing charisma and interaction.  The reboot has really good actors but there is no magic in their performance.  They provide mirrors to their 1960s versions but not much else.  The single exception to this is the truly original aspect of Spock and Uhura, which hints at what this reboot should have been.  Instead, we get a poor rehash of the Wrath of Khan storyline that feels like Iron Man or Captain America.  It also drags out the ""senior leader is corrupt"" scenario which has never worked in Star Trek, despite the multiple attempts and is now so cliche as to be laughable.  The assembly of formula elements screams that JJ Abrams and his film crew just don't seem to understand the franchise they're working on, nor do they seem to have much of a clue as to the nature of the new universe they are trying to build.  The plot holes and logical disconnects in this film and the 2009 reboot are huge, so much so they make anything and everything else seem flimsy and very ill-conceived.

THE GOOD
- Pretty good soundtrack
- Spock and Uhura interaction
- The new Enterprise design is pretty cool

The BAD
- Horrible retelling of the Khan story
- Very weak plot and disjointed storyline
- Mindless CG action
- Fairly lifeless despite lots of activity

CONCLUSION:  Star Trek really ended with the Generations film.  Its fallen off the cliff since then and this film has convinced me it isn't getting up again.",1404518400,3,2364,4.5966587112171835

5288993,3,B009934S5M,"Because that is how I perceived it. There were two disapointments of my summer 2013 movie viewing and you are looking at one of them!
I know usually directors are chosen not because they are familiar with said franchises, but mostly what exactly can they bring to the table. Here, we clearly see that Abrams was wanting to direct something more like Star Wars. Or he wanted to see how one could Michael Bay-conjure up a form of fan fiction. I'll admit that I did enjoy some parts of it when it actually wanted to present a story and setting. The mystery of this terrorist did invoke some interest within me as I was eager to watch Benedict Cumberbatch's acting once again and this time in a science fiction setting.

HOWEVER, as soon as the big reveal occurs- Oh come on, it's been a year by now, you should know it already- But when
KHHHHAAANNNNN is apparent, all of my enjoyment and want of suspense went out the airlock. The sad part, I and along with any Star Trek fan guessed correctly what this movie was about from the very first trailer released.

Me: ""It's Wrath of Khan 2.0 isn't it, Mr. Abrams?""
Abrams: ""Actually no, (insert very long explanation)
Me: ""So it's Wrath of Khan 2.0 and you are completely lieing after the fact that we figured it out already?""
Abrams: ""See, that is where you are wrong, the plot elements involving Harrison-
Me: ""Seriously, I know it's Khan. Stop hiding it. Wait, Khan was never British, particulary a very white British man!""
Abrams: ""No, we're doing something completely different here, in fact you'll be sur-
Me: (insert sound of me getting up from my chair and just walking away)

Seriously, did any of these ""Star Trek fans"" get that vibe that this movie was just tryng to appease by literally adding references from the TV show and movies without even knowing the significance or meaning? In Star Trek II, Spock dying meant something because Spock and Kirk had a freindship that lasted years, and years that I garuantee were much longer and heartfelt than this ""let's assume they are super best buds!"" scenario. I'm sorry guys, but Zachary Quinto's Khan moan was just laughable. It was less cheesey, but felt forced on and not as fun as Bill Shat's. Hell, they even have another cameo that just proves that Abrams didn't want to try to fold out anything unique anymore. ""Hey guys, while we're at it, let's add old Spock in again to remind everybody that THIS IS STAR TREK! So everytime the crew are in a bind, they just ask Old Spock for the asnwers! Even though Lenoard Nimoy cleary stated in the first entry that he should not mess with thier destiny. Then, the super blood magical solution at the end of the film. Even Karl Urban tried to sell it as something as illogical and totally perplexing. This was literally the low point of the film. The movie could have completely made ammends if Abrams had the balls to keep ""said character"" dead and created a brand new path for Star Trek....but no, let's use that super blood because why not? So while were are ahead, LET'S ADD SOME DESTRUCTION CLICHES! Seriously, what exactly is causing all of these damn lens flares during calmer and not calm sections of the film? Is there a department of the CGI effects crew that is only devoted to randomly inserting lens flares for no reason? And how exaclty is this a Star ""TREK"" movie when there is little to none? They trek once to a Klingon planet (which the Klingons look extremley terrible here, I'm sorry) but then it turns into an earth based conspiracy plot. There is 0 exploration or anything that makes watching this as a true Star Trek experience. Come on, already! This is the sophomore title! You are supposed to go above and beyond to break boundaries! Not stay put in the same setting! And here I thought the first entry was going crazy with the desctuction of Vulcan and the timeline changes, but now I appreciate it more because it was more in tune with Star Trek than Into Darkness! Seriously, WHY THE HELL IS IT CALL 'Into Darkness!?'

It's not a completely terrible movie. If you perfer more action with your sci-fi tales, then this will hit your fancy. I do admit to liking Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto in these films. They do get the job done with younger Kirk and Spock, but I wished that Abrams and crew created a new setting instead of rebooting characters. It was nice watching Peter Weller act again because it seems it has been awhile. don't expect anything grand with Alic Eve's role. Her character is in there for another Wrath of Kahn reference only to be sexy instead of interesting. They even undermined Zoe Saldana's acting potential by providing an argument with Spock. Way to go Robert Orcci! You know how to treat women in the future. (sigh).
Into Darkness (seriously dumbest title EVER!) is one of those movies that it will either disappoint you or it will make you go through your popcorn bucket.
Oh, and I read that Paramount did something with the special features for physical releases. Hey, not only you (if you disliked this movie) get ripped off at the box office, but you get ripped off at home!
Sorry, I just found this movie more illogical than fun to watch. I really wanted to like it, but too many Yellow Alerts popped up as soon as the first trailer hit. Then it went full Red Alert when the big reveal.
(incoming Trekkie whine)
If these reboots are based around the old series, then when did Star Fleet patent weapon systems to be functional in mid warp? I though that was a Next Generation capability due to technological advancements. Also, do these ships have any sheilds?

I watched this movie a number of times and enjoy the constant action plus the interplay of the characters.  There are a lot of nice 3D scenes that bring out the depth I was hoping would be there when I watched the 2D version.
On a side bar: Being able to afford the 3D version was what sold me on buying it.  I am a frugal individual who feels it is ridiculous to pay twice to three times what they are asking for in the 2D version.  When I found this 3D version of a more recent movie for under $15, I was sold and was looking forward to some 3D action entertainment.  I was not disappointed.",1404259200,2,705,4.161764705882353

I enjoyed this film. I felt it was better than the first ""alternate universe"" movie, and in the canon of all Trek movies it definitely stands as one of the better one. Top five favorite, I'd say. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is that solid trek fans will appreciate all the nods to previous episodes and films. While this isn't a straight remake of a previous film, it has many parallels and references which are all very fun.

The effects are all good and I thought the acting was overall better than the previous film. There's also a fun cameo of an original trek actor at one point.

5289057,3,B009934S5M,"A Ship called Enterprise... what can I say that hasn't already been said? LOTS of holes in the plot that are either outright blunders in writing or at least require some explanation. The Enterprise, NCC-1701 is NOT a submarine. So WHY was it underwater at the beginning of this movie? Shouldn't they have mentioned WHY somewhere? If you're trying to hide yourself from the native life, wouldn't the transporter have been more effective, with the ship in orbit where it couldn't be seen by the locals? Even if the ship had a CLOAKING DEVICE (which it does NOT), it could still be seen entering and exiting the water. Pretty obvious, huh?

Anyway, I've been a Trek fan since I was a kid during the original series run. We took our Trek seriously, buying everything we could, from ST Academy Handbooks and ships blueprints to making our own props and movies with US as the actors. So I do know a bit about what things should and shouldn't be doing.

OK, so this is a 'new timeline' and things may be different. Is this a NICE way of saying 'turn your brains off and just enjoy the ride'? If so, they should have been more obvious about letting us know. If this had been about the Good Ship Lollypop in the 23rd century with no Trek references I would have enjoyed it. I'd give it a 3 out of 5 and call it entertaining. But it could and SHOULD have been so much more.

Some people blame the movie goers for what now passes for entertainment. They say that people don't want to think too much - they just want LOTS of actions and not too many breaks of 'dialog' in-between. I don't agree! I think people are smarter today than they've ever been, with so many sources of knowledge at their fingertips. Once upon a time you COULD get away with misinforming people about the way things were done. ""Everybody knows that"" was often added to the end of an erroneous statement to give it more weight and believability.

For whatever reason, this movie was made without the wit and twists us fans of The Trek have come to expect. This version would have more appropriately started out with the words 'Once Upon A Time""...

In closing, I have to share my biggest pet peeve regarding FIRST Generation Trek. It is in NO WAY improper for Hu-MAN beings to refer to the whole as the race of Man or Mankind. It is not (yet) Peoplekind, as people are very obviously NOT kind to each other often enough. So WHY change the OPENING LINES?

""Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.""

They now call this 'The Captains Oath"". Seems more like a mission statement to me, but what do I know? I've only been following them for about 50 years. Would Neil Armstrong's statement have carried the same weight if HE had changed it for the new PC crowd? Go ahead - give it a try. It wasn't necessary then any more than it is now.

So shall we be called -Hu-Man or Hu-People? The choice is yours. Live Long and Prosper - PROMISE!",1404000000,6,3069,4.438721136767318

5289107,4,B009934S5M,"As with the prequel, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a load of amusing and exciting fun, and also complete nonsense.  The opening sequence on the red volcano planet offers ideal examples.

The Enterprise has traveled to a beautifully-designed red-foliage planet, with the simple mission of studying (but not interacting with) the primitive culture there.  A big volcano is about to erupt, however, and it will likely destroy all the people.  So, the Enterprise crew decide to stop the eruption by having Spock place a device that will freeze the magma.  Meanwhile, Kirk and Bones distract the primitives by stealing a sacred scroll and running away through a red-foliage forest, only to jump off a cliff into the ocean and swim underwater to the ship.  (Bizarrely, the Enterprise is parked under the sea.  Why they didn't leave it in space and travel by shuttle or transporter is not explained.)  Meanwhile, Spock is trapped and would rather sacrifice himself to the volcano than have the Prime Directive (not to interfere in the natural evolution of a planet) jeopardized by a rescue operation.  Nevertheless, Kirk orders a rescue attempt and the Enterprise rises from the depths and shoots toward the volcano, to the wonder of the primitives.

There's so much that is illogical here, Spock would have a cow.  Obviously, there's no need for the Enterprise to be parked beneath the waves.  Clearly, there's no reason why Spock needs to personally place the volcano-freeze device -- they have sophisticated probes and torpedoes and other space-age gizmos, after all.  Certainly, there's no sense in Kirk and Bones grabbing a religious relic and causing the primitives to give chase.  In other words, this entire sequence -- as with much of the film as a whole -- is utterly preposterous.

It's also a whole lot of fun!

Some viewers will be unable to enjoy ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" because of its absurdities and the havoc it wreaks with Star Trek history and philosophy -- and logic.  I don't blame them, but that's still a pity because, despite it all -- and despite the fact that the film just doesn't stand-up to scrutiny -- it does fill two-hours very entertainingly.",1403740800,2,2169,4.931129476584022

5289116,1,B009934S5M,"First of all, the purpose of the first movie's reboot, was to open up new possibilities. Second, the original Kahn was a freaking genius, not just a throwaway monster. Thirdly, the war-hungry admiral plot could've worked as its own movie without stomping the memory of Kahn into mud. The 'Kirk violates the rules and gets rewarded' schtick is old and we're only two movies into the new franchise. Scotty's been relegated to a clown. Below are some notes I jotted down right after watching the movie.

The opening scene makes so little sense and sets up such an obvious thisll look so cool moment that I immediately felt uncomfortable watching it.
2. The brevity of Kirks demotion makes it unnecessary, especially in light of the last movie and its juggling of whos really the captain.
3. The original Kahn learned how to take over a starship while recovering from centuries of cryogenic slumber. The guy was physically awesome, but his enormous ego and intellect made him a wonderful villain. This Kahns brilliance occurred mostly off screen, before the opening scene. If hed been Ricardo Montelban brilliant, hed have done something cleverer to put the Dreadnaught into his hands.
4. This Kahn was a villain used as a tool of an insider villain, not very Trek IMHO.
5. The blond; I imagined a craftier plot than really existed. I thought she was part of Kahns plan, like the Starfleet officer in the original series.

5289130,4,B009934S5M,"Spoiler Alert...... I thought the movie was good Star Trek overall. It had the ingredients for a good story and of course J. J. Abrams desire for lens flare and explosions. Two issues I had with the story that reduced it to four stars. 1. Do we need to rehash the old Khan Story Again? How about a new idea, A new race, A new enemy. The enemy does not have to always be a single person, as it usually is, but could be a race or a planet.... anyway...  2. Chekov is not chief engineer material, never was. The replacement for Scotty should have been from engineering, I don't care if it was an unknown member of the crew. The recruitment of Chekov made no sense. It is difficult, but not impossible for an older ST fan (old enough to have seen the original airing in the 60's) to adjust to the new story line, especially the destruction of Vulcan in the first movie. My opinion... Create a new universe, an new story line, a new everything and leave ST alone. I'm done here...",1403654400,,975,4.27027027027027

5289135,3,B009934S5M,"Rather than focusing the movie on typical Star Trek plots with technical dialogue, this entry has a heavy focus on action. Presumably, it's to appeal to a more mainstreatm target audience. However, the movie then inserts a ton of subtle references that only fans of the original series and movies will undersand. What JJ Abrams doesn't understand is that fans of the original movies won't like this entry because it foregoes the best parts of the original and they will be missed by the mainstream target audience.

If they wanted to reboot the franchise then go all the way. This is a half-hearted effort in an attempt to please everyone, and it falls flat.

Cast appear to be very comfortable in their roles. But, much of their talent was wasted in this sequel. And, in my opinion, casting was weakest with Kahn (of course, they would have made a much greater effort to successfully replace our memories of Ricardo Montalban). FX are as good as most current SciFi movies I've seen - with the exception of maybe Pacific Rim. Bottom Line: An acceptable ST sequel. But, I'm looking forward to the next ST movie for improvement.

Really should have avoided the whole ""look Kirk and Spock are really the same"" stupidity. Cumberbatch was good as ""Kahn"", but it was forced and they threw away the opportunity to have a Superhuman army from the past desolating the peaceful new future forcing our heroes to face the violence that built and still lies beneath that peace.",1403568000,2,442,4.753246753246753
5289157,5,B009934S5M,"Everyone has heard of the Star Trek movie curse.  Odd Numbered movies always go wrong.  I mean, just took at Nemesis.  Some people said that when the new adaptation of Star Trek (I won't say reboot, because while they're kept the essence of Star Trek TOS, the current cast has certainly made these movies their own.) would start the curse over, or that it would continue.  There is also speculation on if the first new Star Trek movie was an odd-numbered movie or not, since some view Galaxy Quest as being part of the Star Trek curse.

Either way, I was ready for this to fail.  Why?  Because I was happily surprised with how good the first movie was.

But since we're now in an alternate timeline, I suppose we can do away with that pesky curse.  Because I can honestly say that I enjoyed this movie as well as I enjoyed the previous one.  First of all, you can't go wrong with Simon Pegg in a movie.  Ever. And I love how Spock is exploring his human side more and actually expressing some emotions.

But the one issue that I have is this..... and it's a spoiler so don't look below unless you want to:

KHAN!!!!!!!

They brought back Khan too early.  So now, we've fought the Romulans, or at least been introduced to them.  We've battled Khan... they brought out two of the biggest baddest meanies in The Original Series... what else can they do?

And if anyone even MENTIONS Humpback Whales, you're evicted.  Leave.  Now.

Seriously though, this was a great movie, and a great second movie in the new Star Trek adaptation... but I'm at a lose for what they'll do next?  Is this all?  Or are they going to expand the alternate reality even more and possibly bring in the story of Guinan's people, since we never really learned much about how her planet and people were destroyed, and that was prior to TNG so it's a possible idea.  Are we going to see the Continuum?  The Borg?  In an alternate reality, we have so many more options, but they have to be done right.  And I just hope that they didn't throw their two best story lines at us for the first two movies and leave us with nothing else.  I guess we'll see, right?",1403481600,2,2155,4.246305418719212

5289162,4,B009934S5M,"The movie looks amazing, with its sci-fi vistas of strange worlds and futuristic technology. The actors are all good too in their roles, playing a range of emotions and styles from silly comedy to intense action and tragedy. So on its own merits, it's certainly a quality action movie with a few amazing sequences of outer space derring-do.

However, what's sorely lacking from this installment is any sense of intelligence or philosophy that always infused the ""Star Trek"" franchise. Now, personally, I am not a Trekkie, but have seen the shows as a kid and watched most of the films. And ""Star Trek"" was always partially defined by its loftier ambitions, a sense of adventurous exploration that infused fun action with smart ideas on heady topics.

This movie does not have any of that. It simply jumps from one explosion to the next, which are still amazing to gawk at. But the actual plot is quite dumb. It tries to sneakily move from one twist to another, but really cannot exist by its own warped logic. Why the bad guys do what they do, it simply doesn't make sense. So besides its general lack of intellect, the story proper is very weak.

At the end of the ride though, the general production, big-budget effects and zippy pace were still good enough for me to enjoy the experience. Also, I can see how old-school fans might be bothered by some of the liberties this film takes in retooling the lore.

The new Trek is bigger, louder, cooler and sleeker than ever. Too bad it's also dumber.",1403481600,2,1498,4.6415094339622645

Despite the relative weakness of the script, the visuals were wonderful for the time and I loved the film for that aspect alone.  Wrath of Khan really sealed the deal for me, delivering on all levels.  I was not as enthralled with the films that followed, but was pleasantly surprised by JJ Abrams first Star Trek venture and so was looking forward to this installment.  There are lots of slam-bang special effects, but nothing in the story that elevates this film above any number of other ""action movies.""

Allowing a new idea to flourish into a new possibility could be really interesting. Your resistance to a possibility that you could find a pleasurable if you allowed it.  The last ""new star trek"" indicated that the reality of the old Star Trek was to be altered simply because it could no longer be the original based on the story line. That should have been a huge clue.

I simply choose to look at this as an ""alternate reality"" that was hinted too in the series of the ""Next Gen"" series/movies.  For those that are stuck in the old and can't move past the thought of an alternative reality don't watch it and bask in the reruns. However, If a larger concept can be given a possibility then maybe the viewer can enjoy the new reality as much as they did the old one. It is simply a matter of saying ""what if"". Humans might not like change but sometimes change can be a good thing.",1403395200,,1021,4.1725888324873095

So if you're a baby boomer, count on watching this one several times before you sort it all out.  Don't try too hard to connect it to earlier movies, either.  The big villain here is Khan, which we old timers remember as Ricardo Montalbahn.  If you can forget him, you can probably follow the story better.  Or you can just sit back and let it wash over you, secure in the knowledge that you can watch it as many times as you want to understand what's going on.

5289194,2,B009934S5M,"I did not like the first Star Trek because of the fact that it was so predictable and the whole ""going back I  time and altering history""  thing is really overplayed.  I reluctantly watched this movie largely on the fact that I genuinely liked the actors in the first movie (except Kirk)(not the actor but the way he was written).  I was hoping with a reboot, would come different adventures not the same thing happening with new twists.  And predictable twists at that. SPOILERS:

THE GOOD:  The aliens were cool looking.  I loved what they did with the Klingons.  I have to say, Star Trek of the past has always been a little hokey when it comes to the look of the aliens and these looked really good.  The visuals were also great.  The movie was fast paced and a lot of action.

THE BAD:  I know this new cast is supposed to be the same people from the originals but really, the same old jokes?  Tribbles... Mudd... KHAAAAAN!!!!... Nurse Chappel... The TOTALY unnecessary cameo from Leonard Nimoy... Some Trek nerd may have gotten really excited about this stuff but by the time Kirk was dying and Spock was saying the same thing from the origional Khan movie, I was ready to scream.  Rehashing the same stuff from one movie and putting twists in it doesn't strike me as new and cutting edge but rather some ""fanfic what if"" complete waste of time.  The worst thing though is I think these actors are all very good as the crew.  I even liked Kirk better in this one.  I think you could have cast anyone as Khan but you got Cumberbatch.  Great actor.  Too bad he really wasn't in it much.  I really didn't feel invested in any of the characters and the Uhuru/Spock relationship squabble was thrown in there why? I just really would have preferred a rebooted Star Trek that would tell other stories not rewrite the old movies.  I wanted to like this movie.

This cast could not have been better than if the producer had discovered some time travel device and had brought back younger versions of the original cast. Not only were they believable in their portrail of the original cast they also did all of the things one could have imagined them to have done when they were younger. This movie, for us older folks who watched the original Star Trek series, hit on points that in the original were only illuded to, and therefore while being all new kept one engaged to learn more of those earlier events. While I do not know how many of the older referrences made in this movie might sound to someone who never watched the original I still feel there is a stong enough story line to keep even them totally engaged as well.",1403308800,,900,4.52760736196319

It was so well done.  I wanted to like ""Into Darkness"" as much but it just wasn't as good.  The first movie took all of the old characters and made them feel fresh and new.  Why would you take all of that fresh, new feeling and remake an old story?  I suppose it suffered some because of the inevitable comparison to the first movie.  Rating them both from 1 to 10, the first Star Trek gets a 10+ and Into Darkness I would generously give it a 7.",1402963200,,621,3.92

5289279,3,B009934S5M,"let me say I have never been a star trek fan I have always been a star wars fan but back in 3009 I saw the new star trek series made by j.j.abrams and I liked it not as much as star wars but I thought he did a good job to a series that had gotten stale. In this sequel though I felt a lot more could have been done. First off this is the new story of the enterprise crew trying to stop a madman from destroying the basic tenants of starfleet with the threat of war with the klingons over their head. First off yes Kahn is in this but unlike the one from the original series or movies, this one is not as scary but incredibly cool. Secondly Spock and the rest of the crew could have been done better. Even the new love interest between spock and uhura could have been done better and mor lively but it was good. Another problem is the story, and all the little bits that help tell it all. Certain events and characters seem great but other times they are brought down by others especially the end. With one big event that could have changed star trek forever but because of KAHN didn't. I was very unhappy by how it was done and felt it could have had more weight if done right but not this time. Still it is a passable movie. Fans of the series would love it but non fans of the series will think it is a ok movie, what really brings down the Bluray is the extra features. Movie companies need to think outside the box on the special feature if the want the public to buy more blu rays and how things was done is not going to cut it which is all this blu ray has. Still an ok movie

Instead, he stole the plot of ""Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan"", and there is simply no replacement for Ricardo Montalban (Benedict Cumberbatch just doesn't cut it).

5289299,4,B009934S5M,"I really enjoyed this movie until it became enamored of its special effects.  Alas, that is generally the pattern of this genre.  I can imagine the conversation in the editing room: ""Oh, but we can't cut that!  We worked on that sequence for ___months!""  Ok, well if you can't cut it, could you at least shorten it?  When I watch a film, I become fully immersed in the story.  I firmly believe that the purpose of special effects is to advance the story by enhancing the viewing experience.  Overlong special effects sequences only serve to bog down and slow the story.  Ok, so the FX department worked for months on these sequences--fine!  That's what the DVD / Blue-ray extras and deleted scenes are all about.

As for the rest of the movie, I thought it was great.  I am a fan of the original Star Trek series, and found that the actors were generally spot on in their performances.  Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto were great, but I really thought that Karl Urban stole his scenes as ""Bones"" McCoy.  I would watch this again.",1402790400,,1027,4.516304347826087

Overalll, the film was pretty entertaining, and Benedict Cumberbatch was great. I wish he was in the film more. The real low point was the ridiculously maudlin scene in which Kirk dies. It was so overdone--especially given that the audience knows he has to survive (duh-prequel), so you can't actually feel moved by the event.
It was a bit frustrating however to see the plot completely fall apart at the end.
The crew goes chasing after Khan since it is supposedly only his blood that can revive Kirk because of his superior superhuman race advance immune system or somethinghim, and the other 72 people from his Uebermensch race who would have the same properties to their blood and are already lying inert on the ship.
Then, of course, Spock can't kill Khan because it's not like you could kill someone and immediately draw their blood. It's not like it would actually be easier to draw blood from someone you'd just killed than someone still alive who's trying to kill you.
Remember how Admiral Marcus warned that the Klingons would probably be pissed that their ships were destroyed and people killed, and would find out that the federation was involved, and then there would definitely be a war. That seems likely. No one felt the need to explain why that apparently didn't happen?

It has to be extremely difficult as an actor to take on a character that literally made someone else famous and try to make it your own!  Imagine Chris Pine trying to be Captain Kirk without simply parroting William Shatner and making it entertaining!  He does an admirable job.  I'm hoping this isn't a spoiler...

of the events didn't really correlate to the original series.

Someone seeing this without being familiar with the original series will thoroughly enjoy the adventure.

I'll just say it's a disgrace to the Star Trek franchise, even the Original Series which is hardly the most high-minded segment of the franchise. Imagine if Captain Kirk broke the Prime Directive so badly he was stripped of his command, then got his job back out of sheer desperation on the part of Starfleet Command, pissed-off Scotty to the point that he quit his job, got in a firefight with a rogue admiral, and so on. That is this movie. I know it's supposed to be an alternate timeline, but the only difference is supposed to be that Kirk was a troubled child because his father died -- not that the entire human race has forgotten what qualities make a good captain. In this movie, Kirk and his senior staff, as well as Starfleet Command, act like a bunch of frat boys in space. Star Trek is dead.",1402531200,16,915,4.420118343195266
5289382,1,B009934S5M,"Warning: Spoilers

As part of the new Star Trek reboot, this movie was pretty shallow and awful.  It is an attempt to parallel the original Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan, but with a twist.  Khan is back, but no Genesis Torpedo and no real backstory other than being a genetic super-being (i.e. no reference to the original encounter between Kirk and Khan).  Instead of Spock dying, it's Kirk except he's back alive 20 minutes later thanks to a cheesy deus-ex-machina that's only briefly explained earlier.

Once again, the Federation is at war with the Klingons, but somehow that part of the plot is entirely forgotten in the second half of the movie.  How come war never did break out considering the Enterprise crew landed on their homeworld and killed their scout patrol?  How come so few Klingons even showed up in the first place?  It's their homeworld!

The new Khan was a great actor in his own right, but his character was so different from the original played by Ricardo Montaban, it just wasn't the same.  The new Kirk is hard to sympathize with altogether, and was it really necessary for Spock to lose his temper?

Worst of all though is that the movie was just one impossible stunt after another, with no time to build drama, or explore deep issues like the original Star Trek movies did.  It was just shallow action from start to finish. worse than the first reboot movie.

No more JJ Abrams movies for me, thanks.  This was the last straw.",1402531200,18,1451,4.595330739299611

My family enjoyed it, including my wife and 8 year old; and they never watched the tv shows.  Action packed and interesting plot made it a good watch.

There were touches of the ridiculous, and the story is obviously shaped and molded by the times, much like the third season of Star Trek: Enterprise. Khan as superman rather than merely eugenically improved was simply over the top.  But what bothered me the most, is that Star Fleet was 'just like us' and not mankind attaining a sort of better self.  I had enough of that in Deep Space Nine, where war brings out the worst in everyone.  I know, I know, ""But Kirk rose above his anger and hatred!"", but it took an angry Spock full of hatred to end Khan, and that is where it breaks down.  Kirk defeated Khan in Space Seed through moral thought (on the part of McGivers), not anger and hatred.",1402444800,3,800,4.4520547945205475

They had some pretty big shoes to fill, and I think they did so nicely, keeping just enough of the original character to be comfortably familiar right down to the various character interplay.  However, it was not so much to seem a caricature or a parody, as each brought something new, even surprising, to the table, for instance a Spock-Uhura romance? Yes it's true and they even managed to make it believable, even natural. The villain was an updated version of an old adversary, Khan, and the special effects made him seem much more the superior being he claimed to be than the original. So the story was decent and entertaining with a few twists-how the new Spock gets the info he needs to defeat Khan is very logical indeed-, the special effects were good, and I had enough fun watching it the first time that I know there will be a second, maybe even a third or more, and I do hope for another movie at some point, hopefully with the same cast.",1402358400,,1170,4.492957746478873

But you put Abrams and the ST franchise together and it's a hot mess.

The characters aren't believable. They're conscious parodies of themselves. The plot twists are more like taffy pulls, and even the campy braggadocio of Kirk on TOS has been reduced here to a silly James Bond parody.

I have despised each of the movies. They don't work even as standalone works without harking back to the originals. They've taken the original stories, which were of course flawed betimes in and of themselves, and taken everything out BUT the flaws.

When NextGen first arrived, I was afraid it would be a mess like this, but Roddenberry wisely took the approach that the new series depicted a different era, different characters and a different feel.

The Abrams films are like having Wagner recast by Pee Wee Herman - jibing and poking fun but without the fun.

I have tried TWICE now to settle in to enjoy these but I can't anymore.

Mr. Abrams, I won't be spending the money next time. Sorry.",1402358400,8,1211,4.552995391705069

My time was wasted watching this movie as much as I truly enjoy Science Fiction and I do very much, the action was hard to follow it seemed because as intently as I watched I got lost watching in the middle of the action scenes because of the darkness in some of the cuts.

5289493,4,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a valiant follow-up to the 2009 Star Trek reboot that represented a rather hard act to follow.  While enjoyable enough as stand-alone entertainment (I would have given it 3.5 stars, if that were available), it suffers from comparison to the predecessor film.  This is not to say that the reboot was the perfect film either, but it was a mighty good Star Trek film, if one compares it to the series that came before.  Into Darkness contains spoiler-worthy material that I won't cover here, but let's just say that it is as much of a reboot of a sequel as the 2009 film was a reboot to the series.  I was left not entirely satisfied with the way that the film couldn't quite find the independent mind that would have made it a fresher film, refusing to untie the strings that clearly bound it to its inspiration within the prior series, but it was nevertheless a lot of sound and fury that signified a good entry into this new ""timeline.""  Great (if underpraised) performances by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, but it's a true criticism that other characters are disappointingly underused, especially following what seemed like a purposeful team approach in the 2009 film.  Scotty is used the most liberally of the supporting case, though Carol Marcus is also featured for appeal to a larger demographic (and is crucial to the plot, I would hasten to add).  A thoroughly enjoyable film -- one that falls just a little short due to the expectations created by its larger-than-life antecedent.",1402099200,,1516,4.741444866920152

In reality, would you take your clothes off in the presence of your new boss whom you've known for 5 minutes? Don't think so.  One other weird connection was the daughter and general's relationship.

However, insofar as the character, the young man who plays Bones is Spot On. And the young man who plays Spock, well I paused the move at one moment to do something. I happened to glace at the screen I he looks like a stockier Lenard Nimoy. And he portrays a very good Vulcan as well. The young man who plays Kirk, I know they had to glitzs it up a bit, so keeping in perspective he pulls it off alright.

I enjoyed how they brought back characters from the past, yet set them on a different path because of the changed circumstances. Overall, I very much enjoyed this movie.

If Chris Pine & Zachary Quinto don't mind being typecast in the roles of Kirk and Spock, they could live out their careers doing Trekkie films. It would be nice to keep the rest of the cast intact for continuity, but these two (keeping Karl Urban wouldn't hurt either) are the core of the franchise rebirth.

5289567,2,B009934S5M,What a stupid show and the actors are awful. Why is it when they make a new movie about and old TV show that the ship and technology is so much more advanced (when they were young) than the original show (where they were older). They did this with Star wars too. Stop making these Star Trek movies when they were young...they stink!!,1401926400,7,333,4.301587301587301

5289571,4,B009934S5M,Part of what I like about the Star Trek series is the continuity of the story line throughout all the series and movies.  Into Darkness breaks that.  It's OK for people who haven't seen the original series or have forgotten the story line but for diehard fans it's disappointing.  I do love the new cast though and think they fit their roles perfectly.  If another movie is made I hope they stick to the original story line and not rewrite history!,1401926400,,448,4.493827160493828

5289587,3,B009934S5M,"I've been reading reviews for STID for a while now, so I decided I should write a review myself.

I have been a Star Trek fan since my first year of college back in 1981. I had heard of Star Trek but never saw it and when I finally did, I wondered why I never watched it. The show was groundbreaking and gave me a renewed love for astronomy and science. I have since read many novels and watched every series (including the cartoon). This movie is not even in the same quadrant as previous Treks. Sure, it has very good effects and some of the action is good, but the writing for the movie is atrocious. I kept wondering if the writers ever watched Star Trek before. News flash Orci and Kutzman, Spock would never get involved with a cadet when he is an instructor; Kirk would not act like a drunken frat boy and Starfleet would never promote such a person to captain. It's hard to discuss the movie without spoilers, so be warned.

******** SPOILERS BELOW ********

The movie starts out with Kirk and McCoy on a planet that is about to experience a world ending event. Both are running from the natives and Kirk is carrying one of their scrolls but there is no explanation why he took the scroll. They eventually get beamed onto the Enterprise that's sitting underwater. Yes, you read that right...underwater. The reason given for them being underwater is because of the Prime Directive; they can't allow themselves to be seen by the natives. Then why not be in orbit, you say? GOOD QUESTION! The scene turns to Spock, Uhura and Sulu in a shuttlecraft trying to deliver a cold-fusion device into the super volcano that will destroy the planet when it erupts. Spock is lowered down into the volcano but the shuttle is rocked by waves of heat from the volcano, and Sulu must withdraw. Spock sets the timer on the machine and is awaiting his fate. Kirk decides to go against protocol and emerge from the ocean and beam Spock aboard. Of course, the natives see this and starts worshiping the ship as some type of deity. Spock reports Kirk and Kirk is reduced in rank to first officer.

The problems I had with this film is Spock has more emotion than most of his human compatriots. Also, Kirk is rash and undisciplined yet a military organization gives him the rank of captain not because of experience but because of who his father was. Trek physics has been drastically changed; you can now travel from sector to sector in minutes instead of days and you can beam from planet to planet (why have Starships anymore). When Kirk was on the Klingon homeworld, he used his handheld communicator to call Scotty, who was on Earth (even in TNG they couldn't do that). Security in this new Trek world is none existent; Scotty was able to get on the most powerful starship without a single security officer around and the villain was able to fly up to Starfleet Headquarters without a single security drone, ship, officer, etc... to stop him. And now death is even reversed with magic blood.

The writers had better do their homework for the next movie or it might be their last.",1401840000,2,3068,4.530685920577618
5289588,5,B009934S5M,"Great movie, lots of fun. A bit different than the 1980s version. If you like fun, if you like adventure, you will like this movie.",1401840000,,131,4.28
5289589,5,B009934S5M,"So, I was a teenager when the original series aired and was an instant fan. I followed all the movies and various series that followed over the years. What I really like about the new ""Prequil"" Star Trek movies is how wonderfully the main cast members match up to the original characters personalities. In this movie, Benedict Cumberbatch doesn't  match up as much to Ricardo Montalban's KAHN character, but the essence is there, and it's still a great movie. I LOVE how the new score interacts with the original score. I hope they do more movies. There rollicking fun!",1401840000,2,569,4.747474747474747

5289611,5,B009934S5M,"It is really amazing to see how closely the director was able to come to selecting actors to play the younger versions of the people we saw in the late 1960's series of Star Trek. It is also enjoyable to meet characters who become such nemesis to the group of explorers who are supposed to be on a mission of observation and non-interference with unknown cultures and peoples throughout the universe but often devolve into close encounters of a nefarious type. The sets are fun, the acting wonderful and the total experience is fantastic, just the way I enjoy such movies as this genre presents.",1401840000,2,595,4.6761904761904765

He liked it also -  just a plain good film with a interesting plot.  I enjoyed seeing the beginning story of the ""Old Crew"".  I believe that new director and the movie(s) is a breath of fresh air. Even though I liked the old movies the new ships and environment - the scenes are believable and more up to date.  Good entertainment not just a trek tribute.

Acting didn't make it, with the exception of Lt Uhuru, who came across quite well, and wonderful eye-candy besides.  Spock was particularly unsuccessful, as was Scotty.  Both were almost facial, specially Scotty.  Bones came across fairly well, as did Kahn.  A reasonable start into exploring the human consequences of genetic enhancement.

Recommended for Trekkies everywhere, so long as they have the ability to suspend disbelief, or at least critical analysis, and can lean back and enjoy some largely non-demanding viewing.",1401753600,,612,5.322916666666667

Sure, all the Trek movies are full of downright ridiculous scenarios and plots, but this one takes the cake and does so without any originality or amusement.

Typical Star-Trek plot-line (with blindingly obvious parallels to the War on Terror/911) stripped from any deeper themes or meanings that you would find from older ST movies/series.

5289641,2,B009934S5M,"I guess this was intended for the younger crowd that likes action. It's basically one action packed/near death scene after another. Being a fan of the original, many of the plotlines did not fit. Khan was introduced to Kirk here whereas in the series Kirk met him for the first time during their 5 yr mission. Another example is Capt Pike. He showed up alive albeit in a wheelchair in the orginal series whereas he dies in this ""prequel"".

I suppose Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner are almost impossible to recreate with different actors and these actors fell short due to no fault of their own. There's something magical about Nimoy's deep voice and this actor's voice was high and didn't measure up",1401753600,3,702,4.7073170731707314

Burger King in 2009 had a 4 glass collection commemorating Star Trek and I had those till the other day when I broke one.  Don't worry, I ordered another and received it. Anyway the movie was great and I kind of like the new characters of the old guys too.  Nothing beats us originals though.",1401667200,,458,4.290697674418604
5289657,5,B009934S5M,"Having been a Trekkie since the ""early days"", I tend to look for the good in all things Star Trek.  I wasn't sure about the new franchise but fell in love with it half way through the 2009 production of Star Trek. I decided this was a GOOD thing. (I was  sceptical of Jean Luc Picard at the beginning as well.)  I appreciate the fact the 2009 installation in the Trekkie saga opened up a whole new time line so the writers are not constricted by the tenets of ""what has gone before"".  Into Darkness is original.  We have the characters we love, a bad guy that's easy to hate and a story that is engaging and new!  The characters are no longer hollow and iconic.  They are flawed and feeling...even Spock!  Most importantly, this movie is FUN!  Even the plethora of CG effects are story driven instead of the usual cobbled together story line whose main purpose is to set up the next bunch of special effects (so common in movies these days).  I refuse to do spoilers so I will end by saying, ""Raise shields, arm photon torpedos, warp factor six...ENGAGE.!""",1401667200,,1056,4.424870466321243
5289658,4,B009934S5M,"Good movie with lots of action and great set design.  The special effects were well done, and the characters were all true to the original Gene Roddenberry characterizations.

5289662,5,B009934S5M,This reboot of Star Trek has caught the excitement and personalities of the original but with 21st century graphics and technology.  I think even the most casual fan will enjoy this movie but a Trekkie will love it.,1401667200,,215,4.657894736842105

This is all n all just a really great story. I even dig the little quips that JJ throws in to relate to the originals.  ""Bones"" and his ""analogies"" are quite funny.  All around its a great movie for all.  Action. Drama. Comedy. Thrills. Animation.

If you have not seen the first of the reboot series yet then you should not watch this one yet because that would be stupid.  Also, if you did not like the movie Star Trek (2009) and you thought this would be different, despite having all of the same characters and once again made by director/producer J.J. Abrams, then you should stop watching movies and read a book, one you can also color in.",1401667200,,581,4.087719298245614
5289674,4,B009934S5M,"This Star Trek version offers a view of a youthful Captain Kirk.  One thing I have to wonder is how did one so young (maybe 32 or so) get to be the Captain of the Enterprise.  He must have been one really extraordinary young man to take the lead over so many others in the Federation who were more mature.  That being said, it requires little time to be captured into the mystique of space travel in a Star Trek episode and this one is no different.  Fast moving and changing plot, exciting scenes, and really only one main antagonist, which is unusual.",1401667200,,553,4.339805825242719

Completely predictable first half, with stereotypical interplay between the characters overdone.  Second half is a weak rip-off of earlier work.

5289702,1,B009934S5M,"Somewhere in here, there was a story, and that could have been interesting. Instead, the movie turns into the kind of special effects extravaganza that is indistinguishable from most other blockbusters, relying on a rehash of ideas from better Star Trek episodes and movies from people with original ideas.

I don't mind that the film is trying to update the franchise or the characters. I mind that the creators of this film have no idea what to do with the characters or plot.except put in more special effects when things slow down. Character and relationship development would've been a better choice. The movie felt like it was being rushed along to the next special effect.

Pine is a pretty boy who cannot project the maturity that a captain of any ship -- space or frigate or tugboat -- would have, and he is entirely unbelievable as Kirk. He also can't act, but then, he also wasn't given a script he could work with. Karl Urban and Simon Pegg are basically doing bad imitations of the original Bones and Scotty, respectively. Pegg is able to add some depth, but this is nowhere near his other work. I think he was hired because he comes from the UK, and in Hollywood logic, that is makes him the right actor. Quinto does a good Spock imitation and does add somethings of his own, making him the most interesting character. However, that's like saying being spit on once is better than being spit on twice.

The ending where Kirk is saved was way too obvious even before he was in danger, and I found the last 20 minutes or so dull instead of being the apparent series of cliffhangers.

The original series was about ideas and insights. This is about special effects.",1401580800,11,1676,4.614093959731544

There is a reason for that too which I will get to. First off, I watched it in the theater and the first time, I was completely overwhelmed by the speed and the nonstop action of the movie. It was so fast-paced and action packed that I had difficulty following the story line. All the actors in it are superb and just phenomenal. I could see that they and the writers, director, and everyone else involved in making this movie put a ton of work into it. They also went all out on the special effects and it looks very very believable. The story line is very strong and very well constructed. However, like I said I had trouble following the story because there was so much fast paced action happening BUT with each time that  I re-watched it, I found I could better understand and follow the story. And I grew to like the story more each time. Definitely a few surprises in there. You see familiar Star Trek themes throughout and hear some familiar character lines too which just had to the fun of watching this. The ending is beautiful and caused me to tear up. Also, most interesting to me anyway is when the movie is ending, I found myself not wanting it to end. I was ready to see their next adventure. Of course, we have to wait, a bit on that. As for the 4 stars rating, I gave, is for them not including any extra features. My Star Trek 2009 DVD has some very interesting features including interviews withe cast and some of the crew and some of their bloopers in making the movie. But over all Star Trek Into Darkness is a superb and very  enjoyable movie to watch. This new crew has upheld the hopefulness and the adventure in Star Trek which I grew to love in the TV series.",1401494400,,1939,4.266304347826087

All I'm going to say is that I really enjoy it. The actors were chosen for a reason- or two (because I will admit that good acting backed by good looks is a plus), the computer graphics were top notch, the plot is so much better than half the junk out today (and it plays off of the original story well enough), and the music is moving.

It features all of the great characters from the first Star Trek reboot. which is great, however it is quite noticeable that they have limited screen time, with the exception of Kirk and Spock.  That's fine and all but if your going to put out a Star Trek movie every so many years, most people want to see more of the characters they love...cough...Bones...aahhem...Scotty.

As usual, Scottie and Dr Mccoy's characters provide the lion's share of humor and plot development.  I do find the character of
Mr Spock (Zach Quinto) a little too much like dry ice--on the argument with Uhura or his near-death at the volcano;  and a little too over-the-top when he tries to throttle Khan, after Cpt Kirk appears dead.  But then again,  Leonard Nimoy would be icy cold and molten hot under the same circumstances.  Only, Leonard Nimoy seemed to have perfected rather good voice intonations and always

5289780,4,B009934S5M,"The movie was entertaining, but it seemed problematic to me in several ways:
1) Several times, they bemoaned that doing such and such would make them 'gasp' military, as if that's a bad thing.  Historically, Star Fleet IS a military organization, that just happens to do a lot of research and exploration along the way.  If that weren't so, then certainly the Kobayashi Maru exercise would not be focused on defeating several Klingon cruisers.  Luckily, the Enterprise IS a cruiser that just happens to have considerable scientific and exploratory capabilities.  Many of the ships in Star Fleet having nothing but a military/patrol role -- and that's OK.

2) The Enterprise is an exo-atmospheric vessel -- built IN space because it's not designed to deal with atmospheric stresses.  Thus, landing on a planet would be a very bad idea, and underwater even worse.

3) If your chief engineer disappears, you don't send  a junior helmsman officer to take over, you have the senior person in engineering take over as acting, even if they're an NCO.

4) The notion that shooting a long range photon torpedo at Chronos might cause a war, but landing an armed landing party won't is ridiculous.  That's why we use drones to take out targets in uncooperative countries.

5) The idea that an emergency demands the gathering of all captains AND 1st officers in one room is a ludicrous plot device made even dumber by having that room be hugely exposed.

5289787,5,B009934S5M,"Having been a Trekkie since I was in grammar school, I never thought the original cast could be equaled, certainly not bested. James Tiberius Kirk would forever be portrayed by a young William Shatner. Well this young Chris Pine is pretty convincing, less melodramatic and as such has taken the series to a new level. He's more in touch with this young generation. The young English actor who played Khan was also quite convincing but not as continental as the great Ricardo Montalban. The new cast has great chemistry like the originals and with state of the art special effects it's eye candy. Definitely a must-see for Trekkies of all ages. See it in 3d if you can.",1401321600,,668,4.669491525423729

Sometimes I think, with the technology available in the future, improvements could be made on internal transportation and control functions, etc..  But that's just my futuristic thinking.

5289797,5,B009934S5M,"This Star Trek sequel does a good job keeping with the 'feeling' of the original series characters and story line, while providing great CGI that we all wish had available as a child.

5289801,4,B009934S5M,"This is the typical Capt. Kirk of the sixties recostumed and in 3D.  The plot is about what you'd expect and there is the precipitous 3D imaging that most of the 3D movies have.  That being said, it's great if you like Kirk more than later more mature and sophisticated Captains and a lot of fun in 3D.",1401321600,,302,4.189655172413793

5289804,4,B009934S5M,"JJ Abrahams impressed me with his initial Star Trek reboot by making it fun, action packed yet still giving a great nod to the original Trek show and films. This sequel gives us more of the same in a very good way. This isn't just one long special effects trailer, like most summer blockbuster sequels. There is an interesting story with Khan, who makes a more cerebral but no less menacing villain than in the original movies. And great development in the characters, particularly Kirk, Spock and continued comic relief from Doc and Scottie. With this shining cast and JJ Abrahams at the helm, I look forward to more installments in the series.",1401321600,,645,4.716814159292035

5289816,1,B009934S5M,"I see all these glowing reviews and I sit here wondering if there are really that many paid reviewers out there or if there's just that many folks who want to justify having spent the money to see this so called ""film.""

To put it simply it was the single worst Star Trek film paramount has ever made, and that is including V and the insurrection debacle so that's saying a lot!!!

I grew up a trek fan but I have always been pretty forgiving toward the movies because guess what? Folks make mistakes but this one is so utterly atrocious that it is mind numbing to even think it actually got released to the public, Gene Roddenberry is rolling in his grave.
I could go on a huge rant about all the major screw ups, bad writing, bad cinematography, bad acting, bad directing, bad cgi, bad set design, enormous plot holes (and there are so friggin many) but others have already torn it to pieces and frankly I'm sick of explaining the asinine qualities of the film at length.
J.J. Abrams is simply put one of the worst directors in modern cinema.
I enjoyed the first reboot film as I felt the actors had a pretty good grasp of the characters and they did admirable performances, in spite of the enormous plot holes and inconsistencies in the film it's still one of the ones I like to watch. But the success of that film and the subsequent sequel aren't thanks to any level of quality but rather on the extreme sentimentality many Trekkies have for the original series.
These film's bank on that and pull in others with the modern half assed style of movie's that lacks any of the charm or wit that drem real Trekkies to the classics and the shows.

It's a mass market movie made for everyone and Trekkies who simply can't get enough of the old stuff. All the while filled with the single most asinine plot I have ever seen in a film.

If you want a perfect summation of just why this film is retarded go watch How It Should Have Ended (HISHE) on youtube and they will show you the simplest explanation of how stupid this film really is.

Absolutely avoid at all costs, go watch star trek II and have fun if you need a Khan fix.",1401321600,37,2125,4.342569269521411

5289820,5,B009934S5M,I love the new star trek movies. The Wrath Of Kahn was a fave back in the day. Absolutely enjoyed how they re-portrayed it with Into Darkness. Can't wait to see the next one.... If it ever comes out.,1401235200,,199,4.128205128205129

5289822,2,B009934S5M,Overall it's a  mediocre action movie.  It's got some flashy special effects but that's about it.  The script never allows the actors to shine.  The whole thing felt very cliche.  There's one decent scene towards the end but even that is robbed of any emotional impact by the plot.,1401235200,2,281,4.653061224489796

5289826,5,B009934S5M,"I am truly amazed at the actors in this film. I probably should give some credit to the casting crew who selected them as well. All of the lead actors/actresses have captured the nuances of the characters they play - characters created almost 6 decades ago on an at times corny TV series about man's future in space. Even the physical appearances are aligned with those of the original actors. The current Spock and Bones are definitely early images of Leonard Nimoy and Deforrest Kelley. The actor playing Jim Kirk doesn't quite resemble William Shatner, but he has nailed the character! Star Trek-Into Darkness is a great film, a great story, filled with a continuing portrayal of the characters that Trekkies came to know and love so long ago.",1401235200,,746,4.790697674418604
5289827,5,B009934S5M,This is my favorite movie of all of the Star Trek movies.  Love the edgy characters and the action-driven plot and am looking forward to the next in this series.  The classic series/characters were fine in their day but glad to see something new and interesting instead of rehashing the same crap.,1401235200,,297,4.6923076923076925
5289828,5,B009934S5M,"Okay.  I watched the original ST TV shows with my Dad.  Even though he was not a Sci-Fi fan, he recognized many of the actors that had been in shows such as Gunsmoke and Bonanza.  Shatner was always an Outlaw!  So was Bones.  He actually liked the situations that the Star Trek show put the characters in. There always was plenty of action, but. .  there always was a lot of character development going on too. And Politics. And Psychology. And Current Events. ST fans know what I mean.  The movies can't do that.  Modern Hollywood movies use the character build-up from previous TV Series/Movies.  Do not expect character building here. These characters are already built from the TV shows.  The movie depicts their personalities well. This movie is full of fast paced action, and if you are not a student of ST, you can get lost.  I liked the movie because I feel the character personalities are done well. This is hard to do. These are young Kirks, Spocks, Bones, Scotties and Uhurha's.  This movie exploits what we already know about them.  I leave my final judgement for the movie that takes us to the place of each character's personality that we don't know about. Prior to where they were in 1965. I was very happy watching this episode.",1401235200,,1244,4.6
5289829,2,B009934S5M,"Ok. 2.5, but only for the action scenes. This movie is so terrible, it is funny. Did the writers not WATCH Star Trek at all???  Lets see  The Pike thing? Uh, nah. Never happened. The fact that everyone is the same age? Uh, nope. Plot holes? Well, lets just say fishnet hose have fewer! The cast did its best, but DANG . . . lets just say that when you have garbage to work with, well, it must have been excruciating for the actors to try to turn fecal material into filet mignon.

Lets see. The scene with the warp core was TOTALLY stolen from Spocks big scene in The Wrath of Kahn. As in, TOTALLY COPIED!  WTF???? And Spock with a girlfriend  and who that girlfriend WAS? ROFLMAO

What did I like? Zoe Saldana. Gorgeous as always. Special effects. I was in the mood for blow em up so that worked for me. The computerized settings were beautifully done. I laughed until I nearly wet myself over the Klingons  you will see what I mean if you watch this. Face jewelry  Oh, stop! My sides are aching!!!

McCoy never has anything to say that any other character could not say for him (might as well have put him in a red suit). Spock is dumb. The girls (and yes, all the women characters are just girls) are freaking annoying. All the care that went into making the relationships that fueled the sci-fi believability in the first movie is missing here. I watched it once and thought it was okay. I watched it again and realized that it Michael Bay sucked.

If you want to compare with other movies. I LOVED the first Bourne movie, was okay with the second and fell asleep in the third as it failed in exactly the same way as this sequel did. (OF COURSE I loved the bad guy, but thirty seconds of cool bad guy glares only gets you through a couple of handfuls of popcorn. I super-sized for naught.",1401148800,17,897,4.37125748502994

5289879,1,B009934S5M,"I managed to get about 90 seconds into this farcical resemblance of movie making before being driven off. Thanks for killing off a franchise that had some semblance of courage, wit and charm along with the inevitable sci-fi drivel passing for story telling. This ode to soulless money making idiocy will live for a long time with it's only major accomplishment is that it is even worse than the original ST reboot movie. At least I managed to watch the first reboot movie through. It majorly sucked but had a few moments that resembled a soul. 90 seconds was too long by about 89 seconds. If you value your memories of great movies, take a pass on this one and any future movies by this director.",1401148800,22,696,4.531746031746032

hey, if you want explosions, noise, chaos and inane plots this is the story for you. Why are they turning star trek into just another bang and crash franchise. what, now start trek is just another formula series.

if you want mind numbing drivel go watch transformers, fantastic four or the soon to be dis'd destruction of the star wars ""franchise"" etc; etc;

Star Trek was a great set of series and movies for a time. It's time has regrettably passed. Let it die a peaceful death with what little grace it retains.

I strongly encourage you to avoid this film and any future incarnations at all costs.

If you're stupid enough to pay for this hot garbage, you'll only encourage them to continue the stupidity.

The entire film left me feeling as if it was just this close to reaching it's full potential, but continually feel short.  Was it the use of too many unneeded cheesy one liners, the role reversal aspect that has become the expected trope of all reboots, or the unneeded, unsubtle and rather poor recap dialog that continually beat the viewer over the head with ""this is what's happening, this is how we got here, and no seriously this is actually what's happening.""",1401148800,5,558,4.752577319587629

5289903,4,B009934S5M,"I was not an avid fan of Star Trek growing up, but I always enjoyed watching the show on occasion.  I can say the same about this movie, and it's predecessor, the Star Trek remix from 2009.  This round of Star Trek characters seems true to form, matching the personalities (and distinguishing accents) of all the familiar old characters, but with a crisp, modern feel.

The action was continuous, with captivating effects, cool guns & explosions, and a sci-fi plot that didn't feel worn out.  It didn't seem like any of the necessary ""slow parts"" for plot development dragged on.  I wouldn't recommend this for younger viewers, as the violence gets a bit intense, there are some terrorist themes, and there are some token risque scenes - one where a female character is briefly shown in her underwear while she is changing her clothes, and another where Kirk climbs out of a bed where two human-like female aliens remain, implying intimate activities. Also, a spattering of inappropriate vocabulary taints the storyline.

Watching this movie has left me wanting to go back to some of the older movies that I missed, to pick up on more of the back-stories of the characters like Jim, Spock, and the other crew members.  I think this movie and the previous remix from 2009 were a good move and a success in general for the Star Trek franchise.",1401148800,,1341,4.7296137339055795

(all of you people who know kirks combination on his safe know what i'm talking about) in general i enjoyed this film... and seriously benedict cumberbatch well who doesnt like him ... he puts in a strong performance but was he the best choice as the redux of the original khan story (maybe)... now here is where they really lost me.... in the pilot of the original star trek pike is the captain... yeah woo hoo all good but in the old days they used to have a device where they would should old shows or put in information that was never there in a retrospective episode.... interestingly enough the second show featuring pike has him physically deformed in box... so he cant be dead and in the box to go and hang out on a planet with his old body back.... additionally this episode is one of the early episodes that show us the emotional bonding of the crews....  as a stand alone film it was cool as a person who has seen the others the need to hire more people who know what happened before in the stories,1401062400,,1131,4.334905660377358

There is no way to get the movie into iTunes. I went round and round with support, and they are officially incompatible with iTunes. You could certainly buy the movie on iTunes to start with, but then you have no physical DVD.

5289970,2,B009934S5M,"Star Trek used to be a fairly cerebral series and movies with minimal action, this travesty is a massive action movie with minimal intelligence.

I gave Abrams some leeway in the first movie because of the reboot splitting off into a new timeline, but embracing the old, while misunderstanding it makes for a seriously schizophrenic experience that is a disorienting mess.

At least the original Khan was equal part sociopath and charismatic leader, here he is a mindless sociopath. The different timeline excuse doesn't fly because what made Khan happened well before the timeline divergence.

The only saving grace is the outstanding casting of the various crew members, except for Chris Pine. He is weak and can't act. He is even worse of an actor than Shatner. Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg absolutely nail their roles, especially Quinto who does such a good job of a new Spock filled with rage.

Jar Jar Abrams ripped off elements from the original series and the first three movies, without even the slightest idea of what made the original so great and followed the Michael
""make things go boom"" Bay approach. I am not looking forward to the mess he will make with Episode VII, it will make Lucas' destruction of the Star Wars franchise in episodes 1-3 look like high art.

It is a shame that he decided to find a timeline that suffers from massive lens flare. What an amateurish, student film effect.

What he has done is brought us Die Hard in Space, not a Star Trek movie. Did we really need that? He has now joined Peter Jackson in the totally didn't get the source material and made the most mindless movies possible club. May they both rot in nerd hell.",1400976000,26,1666,4.688356164383562

This is a sorry piece of work. The whole plot tears apart the original movies and episodes. Anyone who truly loves and grew up on STTOS is going pound their head with how much they have changed things. I had a problem with the first movie because they did not follow the continuity and history of the characters of the show but this one, they threw the story out the 20th floor building and decided which part they liked of STTOS and used it.

NASA named the first shuttle 'Enterprise' because it felt like the thing to do after all of the requests they received not just from Americans, but from around the world including the communist bloc countries. Now NASA needs to build a series of ""shuttle landers"" that would enable astronauts to further explore the moon and even go to Mars and return safely. It will be huge, but it could / would be assembled in orbit around the Earth. Sooner or later this WILL happen, and I'd love to see the designation of NCC 1701 on it.

If you haven't seen 'Space Seed' and 'Wrath', then this is probably a pretty entertaining movie.  But, if you have seen them and you like consistency in your scifi universe, then you may agree with me that re-writing and re-telling a good original story that completely changes the parameters of the interaction between the characters and renders the original sequel impossible (Wrath of Khan) is a silly idea.

Spoiler Alert:  plot information revealed below.
I also thought it was a pretty lame idea to do a role-reversal between Spock and Kirk regarding the end of the movie ""Wrath of Khan"", where this time Kirk saves 'the many', dies of radiation, and is then miraculously cured by Khan's blood.",1400976000,10,817,4.814285714285714

Overall, I enjoyed this science fiction flick that revolved around the emergence of Khan.

It contains fantastic acting from the leads (Chris Pine is my favourite Kirk) and a chilling turn as the villain by Benedict Cumberbatch, an actor beloved by millions as the ineffable Sherlock in the eponymous BBC miniseries.

I knocked it a point for several scenes which only existed to serve the male gaze (most prominent among them, having Dr. Carol Marcus strip to her underwear to change into a space suit in front of Kirk, which in no way served the plot of the film).  It's 2013...these types of scenes should not be appearing in any film. Period.

5289998,3,B009934S5M,"It suffices as a good action movie, but I wanted more of... something? A certain Je n'ai sais quoi? Plus, although make note that I do not -watch, and don't particular like the Star Trek tv series, it borrowed heavily from pre-existing episodes, as far as plot. I would like them to conjure new stories altogether. Also, I am the type of individual that does not dwell on the past, so perhaps that's just me. I like new, fresh, exciting things. It's sort of boring regurgitating plots and points. So take my review as you may. It is a good movie.",1400976000,3,546,4.415841584158416

5290003,4,B009934S5M,"This installment continues to provide backstory to the now-familiar characters in the series. Interesting to see the early romantic link between Spock and Uhura, and to be introduced to Carol Marcus well before she and Kirk begin that long relationship. Great to see Peter Weller in a major feature (I still think there should have been more Buckaroo Bonzai movies) and Benedict Cumberbatch nailed the cold menace of Khan as the ultimate Trek villain. But for my money it was Simon Pegg as Scotty who stole the show: A much-needed breath of comic relief in what, to me, was an unnecessarily long movie.",1400976000,,602,4.854368932038835

This movie takes us back to the early days when the crew has recently graduated from the Academy and are being awarded their first commands.  Forget the plot, special effects, etc. - whoever did the casting nailed it.  Each of the central characters captures the ""look,"" personality, and mannerisms of his or her counterpart in the original Star Trek series.  As a bonus, the action never stops:  our heroes are faced with one challenge after another.  Finally, the gold standard of tests - my wife, who is not a Star Trek fan and who doesn't particularly like ""space"" movies, loved it.  This movie is great for grandparents, parents, and kids.

5290014,5,B009934S5M,Love this movie more every time I watch it. Abrams doesn't get the credit he deserves as a far-sighted imaginer and teller of this Star Trek.

Uhura and Captain Kirk - now that would have been more believable. The movie was still fun to watch.  If you are a fan of the original Star Trek series, you might have some issues with the ""young"" versions of the characters when they take a departure from what we loved and remembered from the series.. But it is just a movie, so sit back, relax, and enjoy the movie.",1400889600,,535,4.35

I have seen every  Star Trek movie and TV show ever made, many several times, but this was extremely disappointing. The script, story and acting was horrible. While some of the ""young"" characters did an okay job, the script could not survive, even if the acting had been up to par with the previous iterations of the series. I was especially disappointed with the Kahn character. It's not really his fault, but anyone who saw Ricardo Mantalban in the role, with his passion, energy and evilness could not relate to this version. All in all, a huge disappointment.",1400889600,9,688,4.548387096774194

Star Wars (which I assume is current project) is a different animal, but I'm sure you already know most of the details. I hope your spirit has already been devoured by the sarlack and whatnot.  Expect hatred and ugly things but if you pull off the characters in the same manner as this flick you'll be doing Sci-fi a great favor, which is hard.  Budget is yours-> Shoot for the moon!

It's one of the more clever ways to use time travel, and one of the best ways a franchise has been remade. Into Darkness gives some details to the original ""Wrath of Khan"" story, and it's a great take on the storyline in general, giving some more legitimate reasons for the hatred Khan has for the Federation.",1400889600,,383,4.408450704225352

The new stars seem to have gotten more comfortable in their roles and are as believable as the originals. The heart of Star Fleet is attacked and it is up to Kirk and the enterprise to save the day. The action is intense fun to watch.  The friendship between Spock and Kirk also drives the movie into a direction that gives the story a huge emotional lift as well.

I would end my college radio station program on the second, jump into my car and race through Boston traffic in order to get to my gf's place and tv.  Later there was ""The Next Generation"" and all the other spin-offs.  Now we have another generation, only I think this time the actors are pretty weak in their trades and a lot of jumping and running along with magical computer-aided scenes and shenanigans attempt to revise the old story, or at least smear on a whole lot of new make-up.  This was an OK movie to spend some time with if you like the genre.  It was a pretty good movie if you are a twenty-something and have no clue what the original Star Trek was about and why THIS particular Star Trek was made.  I doubt I'll see another one of these because the original story had so much more REAL meaning than just a chance to spend some time watching the screen flicker and flash.  If you don't know what the original Enterprise and crew meant and why it seemed to important at the time (or don't care) you might really like ""Into the Darkness"".

Poor use of otherwise good actors.  Too many nods to Star Wars to count.  Abrams et al clearly do not understand why Star Wars and Star Trek are different and why they should be.

5290071,5,B009934S5M,Good movie. Great effects. But a strange remake take on the Wrath of Khan. Still very much worth watching it.,1400803200,2,109,4.5
5290072,2,B009934S5M,"Sorry folks but I expected far better than this from Abrams.  CGI is getting so overused as it makes you yawn and say not again what child thought of this especially when it flys in the face of physics/reality.  Been a huge fan viewing Trek since I was a teen in the sixties and now 63 myself and I've got to say that this ship has failed so often along with the rest of the fleet that they really need to rethink space exploration altogether. Every failure seems to lead to Kirk's overblown EGO and every failure needs a human manual override and there seems to be zero smart technology hundreds of years in the future. Is AI somehow outlawed?

50+ yrs viewing this and maturing through shows on Cosmos, Science Channel, NG, et al don't any Trekkies actually look at the Enterprise and observe how dumb the design is in 2014?  It's far to vulnerable and there's no gravity and stress points on that design. I would expect JJ to have a team of Nasa scientists to update that dumb design instead of pandering to the same old same old die hards.  How many times must the Enterprise get defeated before they rethink it?

What truly was the straw was the damn chase scene jumping and fighting on spacecraft like we're in the wild west on stage coaches and engineering section looked a mile long and the huge craft storage bay that only had a 3 foot opening - and every scenario needed a human manual override with no wifi or AI to assist.  huh?

Also, I felt Wrath of Khan one of the best but they truly brought no sense of Khan to the story IMO - None.  And as usual the story ends and we end of with a rebuild of the same faulty design, shields that never shield, warp core failure, sparks fly even in a vacuum, and no AI advancement hundreds of years in the future?  Nonsense!  This is a CGI orgasm with zero science unless it somehow caters to Kirks EGO and littered with manual impossible override needs!

We get far more reality in Person of Interest or Fringe than this CGI diarrhea that panders to 8 year old fans.  Come On JJ - The chase scene on top of the craft? Silly Fluff!  Now fearful of what JJ will do to Star Wars - at some point the story needs maturation instead of the SOSO treatment.",1400803200,4,2201,4.297820823244552
5290073,4,B009934S5M,"In ""The Wrath of Khan"", Khan was so obsessed and angry at Kirk for defeating him previously. However, in this movie, the person who actually ""defeats"" Khan is Mr. Spock, both when he decided to send the armed torpedoes to the ship Khan hijacked, and then when he beat him up on earth. So, it doesn't completely fit into the overall story line.

Watching this was like reading a bad english translation for ready to assemble furniture. I know what they mean, but ouch.

5290091,5,B009934S5M,"Many Star Trek movies fail to live up to the hour long TV shows - especially the better written TNG episodes.  But this is an exception.  Chris Pine is a great young Kirk and Zackary Quinto is a fantastic Spok.  These are they key roles to cast in a reboot of the old version.  Pretty hard to top Jean Luc Picard - he topped Shatner in my opinion - probably because of the TNG writing which surpassed all the writing in the Star Trek franchise.  But back to this movie - Cumberbatch is a great villain and an excellent actor too - check out his Sherlock - masterful. Yes, yes, he's the third version of Khan in the history of the franchise but he does a terrific job (I count young Montalban and old Montalban as separate versions). The actor who plays Scotty is great (Hard to find a young Jimmy Doohan but Abrams succeeded nicely here).  Chekov is uninteresting as was the original.  The only really grotesque casting is Dr. McCoy - probably because the original DeForest Kelly was right on the cusp of grotesque himself so casting in that arena is probably the most difficult.  The Kahn story is as old as Botany Bay itself but the writers did a good job of dragging this version a few centuries into the future.  Overall a great job.",1400803200,2,1237,4.390350877192983

Kirk has been met with some trepidation for the way the material has been changed, but this movie, along with its predecessor, would make Gene Roddenberry proud. A re-telling of the meeting and subsequent rivalry of Kirk and Khan is one of Star Trek's more popular storylines and JJ Abrams has done a masterful job of telling it. They also included other elements of the Star Trek canon in this movie (the Mudd incident, Dr. Carol Marcus).

5290103,3,B009934S5M,"This was a fantastic, special effects laden, extravaganza.  So why only 3 stars?  Because it didn't feel like a Star Trek movie.  I'm an undying fan of the original series.  The characters were innovative for their time and just fun to watch in any situation.  They all had distinct personalities, strengths and weaknesses that made you care.  At its core, they were like a family.  In the Abrams version, they're all like caricatures who are slightly off mark.  But the biggest distraction is Spock and Uhura.  First off all, I don't buy their romance.  It doesn't add to the movie, the plot or anything.  Its unnecessary and annoying.  I mean Spock bickering with his girlfriend while they are on a dangerous mission?  Spock claims to be all about logic and duty.  So how can he rationally explain his dalliance with Uhura?  First, aren't Vulcans only supposed to get down once every 7 years?  Second, isn't their a regulation against fraternization between crew members.  But mostly, its just illogical.  Spock must realize that this relationship is doomed to failure thus prolonging it makes no sense.  People may argue that Spock is attracted to her but that means he's following his emotions, not logic.  So he has no problems backstabbing Captain Kirk because of his logic.  But having a volatile relationship, with a fellow crew member, which may interfere with his duties, is his idea of logical?  In the original series, he was always committed to Starfleet, the ship and his shipmates.  No matter how many girls threw themselves at him, he would not reciprocate.  The only time he went against logic was when engaging in noble acts like saving his Captain and crew.  That was Spock's charm.  But the new Spock is selfish, self-indulgent and petty.  He's more interested in getting some trim, fighting with his Captain and boasting about his logic.  He's just not Spock.  Finally,...they really couldn't find anyone else to play Khan?  I mean Cumberbatch is an exceptional actor, but a skinny, pale, white guy is the only actor they could find to play Khan Noonien Singh?",1400803200,12,2081,4.8796561604584525

It's got character development, fantastic effects, good action sequences, and a shuttlecraft's worth of fun inside references to the original series, the first set of films, and the more recent assortment of Trek TV series.

As you might expect, there are also a few things that are loads of fun to watch (or seriously important to the story) that will, upon contemplation, defy logic. I don't want to post spoilers here, but after watching the film I was left scratching my head over, for example, how many times assorted spacecraft of assorted sizes make it into what one would think is a closely monitored environment without anyone noticing (except, in one case, until it's good for the story).

I'm also kind of sorry those twin kitties don't get more screen time, but that a whole 'nother kind of movie. :-)

The bottom line: Trek fans will enjoy the film on a variety of levels, and general SF and/or action fans should find enough in this movie to make it worth watching at least once.",1400716800,,1069,4.675531914893617

The most important lesson for everyone seems to be the return to righteous path at the end. The emergence of the ""5 year mission"" and the end of the war drums that Peter Weller's character wanted to beat made me smile.

His vision for cinematic scenes, acting, and story telling is unparalleled.  Granted this Star Trek is a loose representation of The Wrath of Kahn, with essentially the same villain, it still remains suspenseful.

This movie has funny moments, and sentimental ones as well.  You feel for these characters.  You want this team to succeed!  Overall, this is 5 stars!",1400716800,2,542,4.836956521739131

5290154,2,B009934S5M,"I had much higher hopes for the reboot of the franchise, but so far (in both films) all the writers have done is take a lot of ideas from the original series, and from the original cast movies, and mixed them around a bit, thrown in a lot of special effects/CGI, and given the public something like....this movie.

This movie could have been so much better, on so many levels, but everyone involved has taken the ""lazy approach"" to this project. I'm surprised that Paramount would allow this franchise to be ripped off so cheaply. Or maybe they are just catering to what they believe is the current movie-going public (good reference point: watch 'Idiocracy' for the direction we seem to be going).

Every plot turn in this movie ends up being something that we've seen or heard before -- and in a lot of cases, makes no sense to whatever storyline they are trying to present. They've just thrown it in so they can use up *all* of the plot ideas on the list. Additionally, many of the actors are not playing characters -- in most cases, they are playing the actors who played the characters in the original series. Worst examples are the kid who plays Chekov, and, of course, Quinto as Spock. Best examples are Scotty and McCoy, who do a good job with those characters. Cumberbatch as Khan did a great job as the villain, but it would have been so much more effective if his character was something completely new, not (again) a rip-off from the original series.

Not a recommended movie at all in my opinion.......",1400716800,3,1515,4.5625

The Leonard Nimoy cameo appearance was appreciated, but the movie didn't feel like it had any story - or at least no original story.  I'm so glad that I didn't buy this movie before it went to Hulu prime. It's hard for me to believe all of the positive reviews.  The movie wasn't as bad as the worst that I've seen, but it wasn't interesting enough to watch again.

However the cast did retain some light comedy portion from the original series which has been portrayed really well and that makes the movie more enjoyable.

The conversational English in Star Trek takes too much from today's street speak. ""I got this"", is not the way people will speak 300 years from now. Poor linguistic vision. Also, in the end scenes, the Enterprise looks more like a warehouse with tons of empty space as the characters tussle around from room to room. Very unrealistic and surprisingly amateur in that regard.",1400630400,,486,4.867469879518072

5290220,4,B009934S5M,"As a long time Star Trek fan, I had to watch. Cumberbatch was great. The new reboot crew are great in their roles. But I tell you, CGI is destroying cinema. The ridiculous CGI action scenes, e.g. the chase at the end on top of air born vehicles, all totally defy all laws of gravity, inertia, and the limits of the human form to absorb damage. It is like watching a road runner cartoon.

The first Hobbit movie was so over the top in CGI in the Goblin Caves I almost walked out, and I have read the Hobbit and LOTR books a half dozen times, including a German translation!

At some point will we just dispense with human actors, and all film will essentially become cartoons?

Anyway, that is why I can only give the movie four stars. If you love the Star Trek franchise, you don't skip this movie.

Fans of the original series and movies will be pleased (or furious) at the throwback references.

5290248,1,B009934S5M,"This is an action film (and not a terribly good one at that) shoehorned into a Star Trek outfit.

The reviewers on redlettermedia dot com (their featurettes Half In The Bag and those by Plinkett) did a fantastic job analyzing this movie and tearing it to shreds.  If you'd like to spend thirty or forty minutes examining why this film is awful, I highly recommend their website.  I watched their reviews, thought ""nah, couldn't be *that* bad"", and decided to see it anyway, since it was free on Amazon Prime.

Blargh.

Basically, the film is about things blowing up, yelling, and running. The plot makes very little sense, and characters do not behave rationally or logically.  SPOCK does not behave rationally or logically.  Rather than doing a prequel, as Star Wars did to destroy itself, Star Trek has gone with a reboot to destroy itself.  Star Trek TOS and Next Generation were largely about plot and characters, without which niceties one does not, at all, care about what happens in a movie.  The rebooted Star Trek is mainly about a full, overly dense screen crammed full of CGI junk, with scene following scene quickly enough that most viewers probably won't go ""wow, that made absolutely no sense"" until after the movie.  Protagonists have horrible things happen to them, and one is left going ""meh, whatever"", because they're caricatures rather than characters.

Low points in the movie:

i) Giant space battle off of Earth.  In the heart of Federation territory.  Without ten or twenty starships and space stations immediately responding to a threat.  I call malarkey.
ii) Klingons redesigned, yet again, because more budget.  I guess?  Do not care.  Also, battles on and off of Kronos (the Klingon homeworld) without ten or twenty starships or space stations immediately responding to a threat.

These are not small plot problems.  These are massive plot problems caused entirely by laziness and a lack of script editing.  There are many, many, many, more.

iii) Antagonist is apparently magic.  Or possibly a Space Messiah.  His abilities, which make no sense whatever, do not belong in science fiction.  Other characters have also been given action movie physical abilities.

The lowest point:

iv)  Real Spock, that is, Leonard Nimoy, appears briefly in one scene in this film.  His acting is so wildly superior to the current Enterprise crew as to make them appear like high school kids in a badly directed stage play.  After he was onscreen, which served as a comparison and exemplar, the fourth wall was just shattered for me - I couldn't stop comparing his remarkable stage presence to the screaming and yelling and running around which attempts to pass for depth in this awful, terrible series of films.

v)  There's very little original in this movie.  Basically, half of the plot has been unsuccessfully stolen from other Star Trek bits and pieces.  Yeah, it's a reboot, but one shouldn't get the sinking feeling that one has seen this before, over and over and over again.

I could go on, but there's really no point.  I can't recommend this to anyone unless they're really, really into explosions and CGI junk filling the screen.  Speaking of which . . . with one tenth or hundredth the budget spent on models and practical effects, a lot of the film would have visually felt much more real and less like a bad video game cut scene.",1400544000,8,3357,4.846830985915493

Into Darkness.  They have revamped the old story lines and brought them a fresh and modern look and feel.  You will not be disappointed in this movie and I like how they worked some of the old Star Trek's movie lines and scenes into this one. There is plenty of action and the special effects are out of this world, pun intended, even though there is one plot ploy they didn't quite get correct having to do with gravity, falling and gravity plating, in one part of the movie, but I see they were trying to add to the excitement of the story and can be over looked because, It was entertaining.

5290271,3,B009934S5M,"It was good to see an attempt to return to the roots of Star Trek, but you simple cannot duplicate Kirk, Spock and the rest simply with the use of some of their quotes and mannerisms.  The original cast had the chemistry that made the show what it was and that seems to have been lacking.  The personality conflicts between Spock and Kirk just wasn't as prominent an issue in the TV series.  It became too great a part of the movie.  What's with the apparent relationship between Spock and Uhrua?  Seems to me it was Nurse Chapel in the TV series who had a thing for Spock, but Spock didn't respond in kind.  There were just too many inaccurate portrayals of the original cast to make the new cast believable in their attempts to recreate the original.  The magic is history.

That being said, this Star Trek rendition is head and shoulders better than the Next Generation or any of the other following series or movies using the politically correct cast/crews.  Star Trek was originally proposed as ""Wagon Train to the stars"".  What it resembled more were the sea-faring novels of Captain/Admiral Horatio Hornblower...a fictional Napoleonic Wars era Royal Navy officer who is the protagonist of a series of novels by C. S.

Last warning... spoilers below :)  But you'll have to scroll down a ways to find them.

*******************************************

Okay, so....

I liked it some parts of it.

I liked the actor who played James Kirk.

I liked the costumes.

I'm getting used to the new Spock.

Hated the new Mr. Sulu.  He mostly stands around looking wimpy and stupid, is not played by a good actor,  and is unbelievable when he suddenly starts acting ""tough"" for a minute or two. \

I mainly hated the weird and unexplained plot points, like:

- Why did Mr. Spock care so much about Kirk violating the prime directive by saving him - yet wasn't at all bothered by the Enterprise saving the planet from a world-killing volcano, a violation of the prime directive that was about 10,000 times more extreme than letting the natives see the Enterprise?  (In the various ST tv series, captains would let whole planets and people be destroyed rather than violate the prime directive.)

- Who put the 72 survivors of the eugenics war in the torpedoes? And why?  If the point was to kill them, why not just kill them?  If the point was to save them, putting them inside of torpedoes armed with explosives is a silly way to do it.

- Why was Carol Markus in the story at all? She played no role in it, other than being pretty and disarming a bomb, something any other character could have done.  And her very minor and ineffective role in the story effectively ended about 20 minutes before the movie ended.  Once she was rescued, she had nothing to do but again, hang out and looking concerned and pretty.

- Why does the ""old"" Spock look and sound so completely different from the young Spock?  Faces change as people age, but we don't morph into totally different people with different voices and bone structures and heights and ways of expressing ourselves, who bear no resemblance to our younger adult selves..  And why was the old Spock even in the story? He played even less of a role in it than Carol Markus. And why's he so worried about telling young Spock his future, when the timeline has so clearly and obviously changed, and nothing he reveals would make any difference at this point?

- Why is Bones even in the stories?  That is, couldn't the authors have tried to come up with a better role for him? In the original series he was the foil to an overly-logical, unemotional Spock. In this version, Spock is almost as emotional as Bones and there is no dynamic tension between them at all.",1400457600,3,2613,4.541755888650964
5290308,4,B009934S5M,"Love Benedict Cumberbatch (even before this movie - yes, Sherlock, of course) and overall thought he was a good fit with the ""new"" Star Trek crew.",1400457600,2,146,4.653846153846154

5290311,4,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a well paced and emotionally involving chapter in the lucrative Star Trek franchise. This installment, helmed by J.J. Abrams straddles the fine line between computer animation and human emotions, similar in tone and philosophy to the groundbreaking original Star Trek television series.  Perhaps I'm jaded but after awhile computer animation battle scenes becomes numbingly tiresome.  But more often than not Mr. Abrams bails out of frantic action sequences with the human story- the individual and group heroics essential to the Star Trek legend also provides needed gravitas to the story.

Acting is first rate, the villains multi-faceted and the heroism exhibited by Kirk, Spock, and others is noteworthy and serves to drive the story to heights not usually seen in space operas.  I still have issues with Chris Pine as Kirk (he lacks emotional credibility and depth) but the terrific supporting cast- including a marvelous turn by Zachary Quinto as Spock- serves to support the story and add color.  Plots owing much to revenge and retribution are often easier to ""sell"" because of the visceral emotions those feelings convey to people.  It's easy to invest in this sort of story and Mr. Abrams and the screenwriters capitalize on it.

Very impressive and well done.  4.5 stars.",1400457600,,1309,5.170616113744076

5290315,1,B009934S5M,"Consider a few simple facts:

- When writing about galactic exploration you have, give or take, 160,000,000,000,000 cubic light years of space.  (That's a lot, btw.)
- Inside of this galaxy, you have about 400,000,000,000 stars with at least as many planets.
- Alien life is assumed
- This latest Star Trek reboot created an alternate timeline, which is another way of saying ""we're to do as we please""

What did Abrams do with his almost limitless freedom?  He created a rehash of Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan, which was in point of fact an extension & somewhat rehash of Space Seed (original series, circa 1967).  Seriously?  This is the best they could do?  I mean, really, seriously?

I'm unaware of a word in the English language that adequately expresses such grotesque disappointment. Perhaps the kindest thing I can say is JJ Abrams (and his writers) have succeeded at doing what Voyager and Enterprise never could: he's moved the franchise into ""probably not worth watching"" territory.

P.S: If you're at all photosensitive, the film's endless lens flares in and out of frame are not going to be your friend.",1400371200,21,1119,4.816753926701571

Downside:  the plot is predictable (for trekkies).  Sans the brilliant writing by science fiction greats like like Ray Bradbury and sans the 1960s golden age of space exploration, NASA, and the early moon flights ... this movie degenerates into ""just another action film"" with fun characters and cool special effects.

STID is a fluffy bit of nostalgia ... of COURSE Kirk saves the day by kicking something ... which ya gotta love ... but nothing could replace the original.  In its day, Star Trek was cutting edge; new and bold uncharted television territory.  Sadly this can not be reproduced using the same formula 35 years later.  Our world has changed ... improved special effects can not replace the visionary brilliance of the original which arose during the golden age of science fiction.  TNG had Patrick Stewart and Q ...  I hope we may see another sci fi series as brilliant as the original Star Trek ... BattleStar Galactica for sure ... Farscape almost made it ... but sadly the series died with Zhaan ...

5290318,2,B009934S5M,"This entire reboot has far too many flaws to be anything other than an action ripoff of the original Star Trek.

The Good:
1.  The cast works well together and puts in outstanding performances in their roles.
2.  The premise, although maybe a bit odd, fits well enough and justifies a solid reboot.
3.  Finally, alternate Kirk starts showing some of the mental and moral characteristics developed by the original after FIFTEEN years of service in Starfleet, many times being recognized as a (or the) key officer in critical situations.
4.  Well, given some of the issues I note below, it really does make sense that some Star Fleet Admiral would revive Khan, use him to design and build a super high tech starship to ""militarize"" Star Fleet and try to provoke a war with the Klingons.

The Bad:
1.  Somehow, all of the cast are basically the same age, so we have Kirk (b. 2233), Scotty (b. 2222), McCoy (b. 2227), Sulu (b. 2237), Uhura (b. 2230s), and Chekov (b. 2245) and only McCoy and Chekov (although he looks much older than his actual age of thirteen(!) years old) have some relation to their age compared to Kirk while Scotty, the oldest of the crew, looks younger than Kirk.  In fact, we have Chekov on the Enterprise....five years before the original entered Star Fleet Academy.
2.  Alternate Kirk enters the Academy on 2255 (implied), the same year original Kirk was promoted from Ensign to LT, having completed the Academy years several years earlier.  In fact, the original Kirk had already held several commands by the time of the Vulcan incident in 2258 in the alternate timeline.  In the meantime alternate Scotty gets in trouble and is exiled to an ice planet for years (if you count them, probably more like a decade or so) and like alternate Kirk misses the majority of the maturation, seasoning and experience that turned the original crew of the Enterprise into an elite group.

The Ugly:
1.  Star Fleet senior officers run their ships like personal fiefdoms, allowing Academy Cadets(!!) to be given senior officer slots at whim...and somehow there are no senior officers around to fill these slots, which would have resulted in officers like Captain Pike being relieved of duty for promoting young, untried and unprofessional Cadets to command over such senior officers.  Except for Spock, there only seem to be three ranks at Starfleet: Admiral, Captain and Cadet.
2.  The alternate Enterprise's engine room.  I mean seriously.  It is built like a massive factory and there are so many levels and so much (mostly empty) cubic footage, that after you add a bridge, a sick bay and some corridors, there probably isn't any room left for crew quarters.
3.  Face it, alternate Kirk is now and always shall be (at least for the next 12-13 years) a punk kid thug who hasn't been in the diplomatic, military or command situations that made the original Kirk a solid fit for the Enterprise when he took command seven years after (for a total of twelve more years experience) than the alternate Kirk.",1400371200,15,3012,4.770712909441233

With this movie the Star Trek franchise has parodied itself to death, becoming a mirror image in a circus fun house.  Great special effects and acting, poor plot and unbelievably poor plot devices.  It all averages out to an average movie, sort of like the James Bond movies after Sean Connery left.

I just watched it again, almost two years later, and it's better than I remembered.  Maybe it's because I'm more familiar with the actors and better identify them with the roles they play.  I still hate the way the ending is rigged, but overall it was a pretty good adventure.  I'm bumping it up from 3 stars to 4.",1400371200,8,880,4.525316455696203

The second time, I paid more attention. Here's what I liked about the movie: the actors who played the following characters were all great - Bones, Sulu, Spock, Chekov, Pike, and Scotty. Specific things that were original or well done: the warp speed effect, the Klingon Bird of Prey, Jupiter's red spot, the warp core room, the spaceship crash in San Francisco, the dress uniforms, the new five year voyage and the end credits.

Things in the movie I didn't like: the cringeworthy Uhura-Spock relationship, the violation of the prime directive, Cumberbatch channeling Voldemort as Khan, the 360 degree camera shots, Kirk micromanaging everything, Dr. Marcus, Old Spock, the Kirk-Spock bromance, Kirk's extreme emotionalism and the recycling of Star Trek II with a few twists.

This movie ripped off lots of other movies. The ones I caught were: Aliens, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Harry Potter, Star Wars III, Blade Runner, Predator, Silence of the Lambs, A Few Good Men, Titanic, Firefly and Star Trek II.

5290338,4,B009934S5M,"You can tell a lot about a movie by just looking at one of the necessary pieces that go to make a stunning story. Just check out this story's Inciting Incident, the event early on in every movie that launches the story.

Before that, this movie's early action shows a senior Starfleet operative, John Harrison, setting up a bombing at the London Starfleet offices, killing 40+ people, leading to a post-event Federation meeting with Pike and Kirk attending. During that, adding insult to injury, Harrison attacks again, this time from a helicopter gunship, and kills many present, including Commander Pike. Pikes death hits Kirk hard, and apprehending Harrison becomes, briefly, the driving force in his Starfleet career. This brings us to the Inciting Incident, which at its best ties in with the story's theme. The theme here is what constitutes true leadership? What does a leader do when his best friend faces death under his command? Is it ever justifiable to jeopardize your crew, those men and women depending on your leadership to not squander their lives, to pursue your own personal goals. This is what Kirk has yet to learn.

Following that meeting, Kirk (Chris Pine) asks for Starfleets permission to go after Harrison, whos holed up on Kronos. Harrisons attack cant be ignored, and Colonel Marcus gives the go-ahead, suggesting they use new photon torpedoes covertly to destroy that part of deserted Kronos where Harrison is hiding out. Kirk sees no problem in that. That's the Inciting Incident: his initial preoccupation to do whatever it takes to get the person who took the life of his friend and mentor, Pike.

The story shows whether Kirk comes to understand, and grow into, being a leader, a Starfleet commander worthy of the name. The movie is an excellent combination of top-notch storytelling and breakneck action sequences.",1400284800,,1847,5.029411764705882
5290339,3,B009934S5M,"This is not the Captain Kirk and Mr Spock I know from previous Star Trek episodes and movies.  Yes, I know they once were young and had to grow into their feet; of course Kirk was feckless and thoughtless as a young man as Spock was pedantic and full of his own superiority.  A friendship has to start somewhere, after all, and these became remarkable men and invested friends.  I just didn't envision them the way this film depicts.  It is a life and death adventure, with all the action and special effects one might expect from a space-opera with the chops this one brings us to expect.  The villain is terrifying and dauntingly powerful.  The future will be bleak indeed for all of galactic civilization if our heroes do not prevail.  If the bang and whoosh is what the movie-goer seeks, this will be an enjoyable hour or so.  But, I expected more.  I expected to see character development.  I expected layers of plot and some thematic resonance to the universe and political situation inhabited by the adult Kirk and Spock.  There was lip service to that idea, but it never gelled for me as anything meaningful and real.  The challenge of good science fiction is that it depicts real people in the world of the improbable possible.  This effort reaches but does not touch the goal.",1400198400,3,1286,4.587719298245614

I don't want to debate with anyone the quality or validity of the storyline as I know there are lots of trekkies with very serious opinions on the matter. I have given this a good rating because I really enjoyed the movie. It was fun to watch and the action and special effects were great.

5290346,4,B009934S5M,"The best Treks have always had something to say even if they weren't too subtle in delivery. In that vein, Into Darkness is following a fine tradition. Worries about drones, preemptive war and the lengths we'll go to to maintain 'peace and security' are all here. There are definitely elements that feel rushed and a few editing decisions that make space travel seem *awfully* fast, but then again that's part of the Trek tradition, too. The opening 12 minutes are fantastic, and virtually indistinguishable from any number of Original Series episodes.

The great strength of these reboots is the cast, and they continue to shine here. Pine's Kirk gets a taste of humility several decades earlier than his Prime Universe counterpart, Spock continues to struggle with the loss of his people and his emotional balance, and Uhura is given more to do in one movie than her original incarnation was given in 25 years. I did feel Karl Urban's Bones was underused as was John Cho's Sulu. But hey, the original Trek movies rarely gave the supporting players much to chew on, either.

I did feel the third act reveal of the villain didn't quite work, though Cumberbatch obviously gave it his all. Though I thought the reversal on a pivotal Wrath of Khan scene worked better than many are saying. Overall, it was a very fun movie that also snuck in a message about the dangers of acting on revenge.

With a new writing team behind the scenes and Bob Orci taking the directing reigns I'm hoping Trek 3 will take a more thoughtful approach to the series and maybe slow things down a bit. And I'd like to see a wholly original story, not involving the reuse of any major plots from Trek's past. The Final Frontier surely has plenty of new stories to tell.",1400025600,,1742,4.6677524429967425

Oh yeah, and also, now that we can beam from a planet to any other planet, the entire Star Trek premise is totally deleted. VERY poorly done, for any Star Trek fan.

Khan savors his wrath against Captain Kirk, who left him marooned in Ceta Alpha VI, but now is in control of the dreadful genesis torpedo capable of reorganizing matter to the molecular level to rearrange its matrix, and create life from lifelessness, or kill existing life for a new one. With Star Trek Into Darkness, these concepts are...I don't know how to explain it...not there. I love the acting, the visual effects on IMAX 3D, and think that the chemistry between the new crew, the younger crew, is superb. The plot is convoluted and could have been written better. Another thing different from its two previous predecessor episodes, is Khan, a role played by Benedict Cumberbatch, was not developed to its full potential as it has before. In the end [spoiler warning] it is Spock who fights and defeats Khan. Even so, the animosity had been between Khan who blamed Kirk for leaving him, and his crew marooned in a remote and distant planet (which was laid waste by the orbit change of Ceta Alpha V).

5290371,2,B009934S5M,"The main problem with Hollywood's current crop of big budget so-called blockbusters is that they have all become one big movie, totally dependent on CG visual effects, re-running the same old action heroes and storylines from previous episodes, and ultimately serving up nothing original . . . and alas, this is the case with Star Trek : Into Darkness.

All the elements are there all the things we've loved about this franchise over the years. Chris Pine is a perfectly suitable Jim Kirk, Zachary Quinto's deeply etched and by-the-book Spock is vastly familiar and Karl Urban continues to channel the soul of DeForest Kelly; but therein, I fear, lies the death knell for Star Trek, for we have entered the realm of keeping this franchise alive at all costs, by retelling old stories, employing even grander scenes of destruction, longer battles on ever larger scales  troubles that require tribbles  and a reservoir of plots so depleted that an old villian needed to be resurrected to get this movie up and running, along with Dr. Carol Marcus, the once and future director of the Genesis Project, seen in her earlier years, portrayed here as a plastic Starship Barbie, so bimbo-like that any minute I expected her to text OMG to her girlfriend, very much in contrast to the classy 1982 incarnation that Bibi Besch gave to this character in The Wrath of Khan.

The visuals are simultaneously thrilling and yet over-the-top. I am not sure just how many exploding and colliding star ships we need to see; but just as I have had my fill of James Bond, I am sorry to say that not only will this be the last Star Trek movie I will see, it may also be the last one filmed. Most of the trekkers will like it, of course, and even some of the trekkies, but for me, Star Trek has run its course.

They all had characters, personalities, drama and last minute solutions to problems that could end the universe.  Into Darkness lacked all of that.  Although I grant you it was STAR TREK, it was written for teenage boys that like things crashing and exploding and don't care about characters, personalities and dramas.  Way too much of the movie was given over to  things crashing into San Francisco, explosions and other places that seemed to go on forever.  There were the usual fights but they were also indeterminable.  Only about 30 minutes of the movie was interesting.

His interference did many things, like restore the Klingon ridges early (lost in the 22nd century during Star Trek Enterprise and back by Star Trek The Motion Picture in the original time line)! His arrival was after enterprise, so he couldn't prevent the lost of Klingon ridges! Did the bad guy from the previous film give the Klingons access to technology that restored their ridges faster than 2172 (the year V'Ger invaded)? They don't say! I also dislike Chekov's hair! Hopefully they'll match it to look more like Walter Koenig for Star Trek 13!

Anyway, a terrorist is threatening the federation!  It's up to the crew of the enterprise to stop him!

I enjoyed Montalban as Khan in the first one, but Cumberbatch waS MASTERFUL in this version. His facial expressions were so fluid and realistic that nothing he would have done in his character on screen would have surprised me or been out of character.  It took me (a Trekkie) a bit of time to adjust to these new Kirk, Spock, Ohura, Scott, and  others, but reconciling myself to this being the characters at a younger-yet-later time in their histories finally made me accept them.  I thought McCoy a little overacted, but the scenes with both Spocks at once was priceless.  The entry episode was gorgeous as well, and lived up to the mystique of Star Trek. Overall, the actors lived up to the special effects and captivated me.  In this one, I have watched it many times, several back-to-back, and I still see something new every time I watch it.

I get that Trek purists may not dig JJ's take on the franchise. That's fine. If you didn't like the last one, skip Into Darkness and revisit TNG on Blu Ray.

The best part of ST:ID is the scope, vastness, expanse of characters and themes. Most Trek movies take place on the Enterprise and rarely stray (The Voyage Home being an exception, and proving when you take the crew out of their element it works tremendously).

We have a new spin on an old story, a much needed tech-injection and locale change. Special effects were solid and the overall story played out nicely... for the most part.

The dialogue was a little clunky, some of the payoff scenes which appeared to be throwbacks to Wrath of Khan didn't really land. That being said, i see this more as a re-telling of Space Seed than ST:WoK.

The Khan reveal was probably handled poorly in the advertising and fell flat, worst kept secret. Some of the action scenes went full video game mode.

The cast is strong enough to carry ST:ID and I'm glad they did.

Hopefully the next installment is more of a tip-of-the-cap to the original Roddenberry vision.",1398211200,3,1364,4.588477366255144

I am not one of them. Granted it is not the beloved Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc. of my youth, but they do a great job anyway. The villain's identity was not a huge surprise (sorry J.J.) but pretty well done. Yes, there was a bit of shark jumping with the miracle blood. Other than that it was a pretty good homage to the original Wrath of Khan. I enjoyed the reversal in the radioactive chamber and the quotes from Shatner/Nimoy. Hey, Khan was a likeable villain in ""Space Seed"" and Wrath of Khan, sort of here too, misunderstood and wanting revenge. It worked. Lots of action, the interplay between the trinity (Kirk/Spock/McCoy) was well done and it was fun to watch. Brought in some characters from the original universe which was intriguing.  If you haven't seen it by now, you just don't like Star Trek.  Oh, and the phaser is great. Got the ship last time. Wonder what is next.",1398124800,2,1047,4.38659793814433

5290443,5,B009934S5M,"Admittedly the splitting up of special features across a variety of DVD releases is a crass $$ grab from the studio and is to be deplored.  For the people boycotting buying this movie for that reason...that is their choice.  For the cinephiles, sci-fi buffs, and Trek enthusiasts the movie itself must be considered and when the topic is returned to the film proper we are left with an exciting, intense, dense, and frenetic sci-fi action movie full of political intrigue and machination, some sharp acting from likable actors, and loads of nods to fans from the old Trek lore but packaged for a new sidereal reality.  I think that part of the fun of this movie is that though we are dealing with known characters they are no longer trapped replaying what we've already seen but just now updated for today's special effects and savvy scriptwriters; they are beholden to similar elements of a history that we know of but is no more, but it is only the elements that are similar and how they will work themselves out in this line of reality intrigues.

The heart of this movie is still Kirk and Spock (less so Bones) but all of the crew (especially Scotty) get some nice play time here.  Returning one of Trek's most popular nemesis, Khan (played with unnerving precision by Benedict Cumberbatch), Kirk and crew are presented with the option of taking out Khan after he attacks and murders some high-ranking Starfleet officers on home turf.  Kirk has to be careful, though, not to start a war with the Klingons as Khan is hiding in their habitat.  All of this is orchestrated by some human hawks in this particular future (apparently despite the prime directive there are more than a few men who still believe in some good old-fashioned military imperialism with the notion of taking one's enemies out before they get the chance to take you out).

The ending of this movie is a nice twist on ""The Wrath of Khan"" though it isn't as heart wrenching.  Still, the spirit and flavor of Star Trek lives on.  There are those who are criticizing the lack of its boldness by ""going where men have gone before"" instead of exploring new territory.  That's fine and all but they may be living in the past, not this new sideline present.  I for one am extremely satisfied.",1398124800,3,2257,4.64321608040201

Star Trek Into Darkness is action packed and can stand on its own without having to be another back story about the original crew of the Enterprise, however,If you are a fan of the Original Star Trek TV shows, you can appreciate Star Trek 2009
 as a prequel to the original series. With a few inconsistencies with the movies history and a bit of PC thrown in for filler, Star Trek 2009 shows how the young Kirk, Spock, Uhura, and the rest first found their way to Starfleet Academy and onto the decks of the Enterprise.

5290457,4,B009934S5M,"This is a review of the DVD - movie only.

Bottom line first: Entertaining and worth the cost and the popcorn. Having established the new crew, the writers could develop an actual story. The result is that this is a more personal Star Trek , less about special effects and more about drawing the crew together. I liked this movie and recommend it to Trekkies and to those looking for a light weight action movie. The violence is not so graphic as to make it unfriendly to the kids and there is enough not about technology and flashing lights to keep the non Trekkies in the home audience interested. These movies are never about brain food, more like an afternoon off with some excitement.

As always these movies come with a package of inconsistencies. I will try to avoid spoilers and sum them up as being not so much logical inconsistencies as structural inconsistencies.  Years ago I remember a professional review noting that in these movies, no matter how massive the destruction of ship/aircraft/space ship and etc., the damage is never exactly that bad. Just something to think about....

""Space the Final Frontier..."" turns out to be London! It has to be London because we are here to chase down Sherlock Holmes (dun dun DUN!). OK its Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Holmes for the BBC , but in Into Darkness he has a slight change in make up mostly the same wardrobe. Here he gets a Much cooler overcoat, and pretty much the same lines, motivations and delivery/acting style.

As usual Spock does not know how to chill or to be a pal. ""How to be a Pal"" could have been a better subtitle than Into Darkness, but never mind. Pay close attention to Spock. He gets all of the best lines. Scotty has some nice writing but much of that is on his walking plush toy, Keenser. Sulu and Chekhov almost disappear. Love interest <?>  Uhura gets to be brave, mouthy and pouty. I guess that is what every aspiring female adventurer wants. There is a ship's doctor for some reason and a female who will (no spoiler to Trekkie's) be a future love interest.  Can Star Trek III: Kirk Gets Past his Green Skin Hang-up be far away?

Over all this is a fun movie. Even so I can't see Gene Roddenberry being that happy. There are too many casual deaths, masses of people sucked into space and no actual exploration, meeting strange new life and the rest of the values GR was famous for promoting.  Based on the movie's ending it is possible that the next High Noon Shoot `Em -up from this cast and writers may move the action away from Earth.",1397606400,2,2612,4.698030634573304

I would say one of my favorite scenes is the movie involves the main villain: he totally dominates.",1397606400,,257,4.608695652173913

The sound is fantastic as well, althought it became very demanding of my set up (9.2) and softly clipped my front channels during some scenes.  Highly recommended.",1397433600,,329,4.7368421052631575

it's just s***ty quality control. How difficult is it to get that right?

Second, you have only 30 days to get a replacement. So, if you didn't look at it right away, you'll never be able to see it.

5290467,4,B009934S5M,"I have been a Trekie for so very long now and it was refreshing to see how they managed to get Kirk and Spocks' characters down to a fine art.  The whole idea of a duplicate Kirk and Spock had already been touched on in the series so I was over that hurdle.  I usually find that replacement actors aren't nearly as good as the real thing. Since these are ""prequel's"", it transitions quite nicely.  Especially for tying those loose ends from the series together.  I didn't however like the part where they kill off Capt. Pike as in the series...he was in a wheel chair but was taken by Spock (providing a mock court martial for kidnapping) so that the retired Pike could live out his life in sort of a ""Fantasy Island"" scenario.  However...the dual universe storyline takes care of this...I just didn't like it.  The movie itself stands on it own however and the reason being is the casting.  Casting was brilliant in this case.  I would recommend ""Into Darkness"" and the prequel, The Movie, Star Trek, to any Trekie; Sci-Fi aficianato or anyone else who likes good adventure and time-travel movies.",1397347200,,1098,4.5948717948717945

5290471,2,B009934S5M,"The main redeeming factor for me was watching Benedict Cumberbatch trying to be a bad-ass baddie on screen (though, in my opinion he didn't have nearly enough on-screen time as a central villain), but once I realized that he was portraying the character of Khan, it was beyond frustrating to think that an actor of color would've been so much more appropriate to breathe life into the role -- and god knows, there's no shortage of competent actors of color in Hollywood dying to play a powerful, challenging role like this.  I was also very frustrated with the lack of connection between Uhura and Spock.  It was such a compelling twist in the first film creating a new reality for them to connect in.  There are so many creative storylines they could inhabit in these films as they develop their lovestory.  But this film left me feeling very flat and frustrated.  AND, on top of it all, being a looooong time Trek fan going way back to the original 'Space Seed' episode on the original series that spring-boarded Ricardo Montalbn into his menacing, iconic glory as Khan (that always made me totally hate the Mr. Roarke wackiness we surfed through in the 70's on that damn magical island he ran)there's so much else that perplexed me in this film.  Why on earth did we have to suffer through the bizarre borrowing of ""Wrath of Kahn"" dialogue and the role-reversal climax between Spock and Kirk???  When Quinto's Spock shrieks ""KHAAAAAAAAAN!"" my friends and I let out loud, collective groans and massive eye rolls.  And, touching back on my frustration with the Uhura/Spock awkward connection?  I would've LOVED to have seen Spock go into attack mode against the Klingon who strangled her...but, once again, the bro-mance between Spock and Kirk took centerstage.  All those pivotal scenes about his conflicts with emotions of love and friendship vs. logic...who else but the woman he loves should be the key subject of his self-analysis and confusion???  The first film really did make me interested in the new direction the Star Trek universe might boldly go, but now I'm just annoyed and shuddering to think of what Abrams might hack together for the upcoming Star Wars reboot. For my taste, ""...Into Darkness"" is not worth owning in my library.  I encourage renting it before you commit to buying it.",1397174400,16,2303,4.8320610687022905

Great music, each scene and event has great background sound, effects, and graphics.  It's a blast from beginning to end.  Each character really hit their role, although the female characters tended to be a bit more emotional this time around, wouldn't mind if they were a little stronger in the next one, hope there is a next one.

5290499,1,B009934S5M,"As a lot of others have said, it's basically an atrocity that the name Star Trek is on this mindless CGI action-porn movie.  I'm not going to waste a lot of time on a long review because this dredge isn't worth it.  The script is terrible, the acting is bad and there's virtually no character development.

The only way they can redeem this is if the next one starts with real Spock waking up on the Enterprise-e.  Then, Captain Picard walks in the room and starts speaking in complete sentences with interesting dialogue and you realize that these last two movies were just detailed accounts of nightmares Spock was having in his old age as he was being transported by the Enterprise-E to visit Vulcan.  Then the ship receives an SOS transmission from Commander Riker and the USS Titan and we get the long awaited follow-up to nemesis.

A nice corny ""it was all a dream"" gimmick to counter JJ's even cornier timeline change gimmick would make perfect sense.",1396569600,11,958,4.6390532544378695

Elizabeth Taylor is as real a depiction of Cleopatra as Benedict Cumberbatch is of Khan.

And they lose Star Treks sense of style. Too often I felt like I was seeing Star Wars or Blade Runner or Firefly, too little I felt like I was watching Star Trek. Instead of updating the franchise or making it accessible to the next generation, I felt like they were saying that the old Star Trek just wasn't good enough.

Much to my disappointment my husband decided to buy a BRAND NEW 3D dvd player -Samsung BD-H5900. The 3D disc still will not play. And yes, we updated the brand new player's FIRMWARE.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-BD-H5900-3D-Blu-Ray-Disc-Player/dp/B00ICDAAXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung BD-H5900 3D Blu-Ray Disc Player</a>

I am rating the purchase 1 star because I bought it to play on a 3D Player.  It will not play on Samsung 3d Players purchased in 2011 or 2014.
This 1 star review was for the actual product, not the movie content (I'm not on IMDB afterall!) It's important that people know there WILL probably be problems with the 3D disc on these SAMSUNG players, and hopefully that will encourage Samsung to fix the problem.

And yes, we contacted SAMSUNG about the BD-5500 not playing the disc.  They said they'd put a in update request.  NEVER happened (probably because that player was obsolete...oops, I mean 3 years old- 2011.) I will be contacting them again about the newly purchased 3D player.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BD-D5500-Blu-ray-Disc-Player-1080p-Black/dp/B004N85YBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BD-D5500 Blu-ray Disc Player - 1080p - Black</a>

Neither the Samsung BD-D5500, nor the Samsung BD-H5900, 3D players will play the 3D Blu-Ray!  Our software is up-to-date according to Samsung.
Sooooo, either Paramount/20th Century Fox has added more anti-theft code and not notified Samsung, or Samsung has upset Paramount.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Into-Darkness-Blu-ray-3D-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-Copy/dp/B00CTSDDVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek Into Darkness (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy)</a>

The rating is only for the fact that the 3D disc won't play (the whole reason we bought it.)
Dial-in updates have RUINED disc watching.  DVD piracy seems to dictate that the end-user who BUYS a studio approved disc loses.
However, I will say that I'm shocked that the regular Blu-Ray is still playing.

We give the actual movie 5 stars.  Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Anton Yelchin and Zoe  Saldana do a great job.  Watching Zachary, Anton and Karl perform feels like watching the actors from the original tv show.",1395964800,2,2352,6.155963302752293

I wanted to like it, since I'm a lifelong Trekkie and a more recent fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, but I couldn't.

My only complaint without too much of a spoiler was the death of a key person. Great film. Can't wait for the next one, this reboot is SO much better than I ever could have hoped for!

Some commenters complained that I didn't give much of a review, so here is some more information: This particular film is an update on Space Seed and The Wrath of Khan but this time Khan's wrath is aimed at Admiral Marcus and Starfleet. It is also somewhat reminiscent of the novel ""Dreadnaught"" in it featured an Admiral bent upon starting a war with the Klingons and building a pure military vessel for the purpose. The movie continues to build on the story of the early growth of Kirk, his relationship with Spock and the crew, and his role as a commander. Unlike an other reviewer, I think that the casting has been fantastic, particularly Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Chekov. Cumberbatch was brilliant as Harrison/Khan. I was not thrilled with how they presented the Klingons although it is easier to see how they could have been a couple generations prior to Worf as opposed to the Klingons of TOS.

Another thing, if Khan's blood can cure any illness and bring people back from the dead, why did they put him back in stasis? Why not hook his ass up to a machine that keeps him alive and milks his blood? Or better yet, why not just put his blood into a molecular replicator?

It is better than the original Khan and the eighties Khan (although I kinda miss  Ricardo Montalbn's character, ""Corinthian Leather"" ...""it attaches itself to your ""cerebral  cortex..."" great stuff!).
Action packed, great special effects, all impossible death defying stunts, impossible but that's OK! Entertaining, dark, funny good story line and at times actually believable!
The moment between Spock and Kirk when their friendship truly bonds is actually quite moving, you feel they truly become friends in the deepest sense of the word, worth seeing the movie just for that scene.

I do like the cast very much and I do like the story lines and character developments.

5290664,5,B009934S5M,"I won't spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it yet, you can read professional movie reviews for that.  I will say that the role that Kahn plays and how he is portrayed just doesn't seem consistent with the Kahn from the old Star Trek movie, and the whole storyline with the top ranking Starfleet officer---I just have to roll my eyes at that.  Aside from those gripes, this movie is even more amazing than the first one with Chris Pine.  I was skeptical about the first movie, only to be pleasantly surprised, and so then I was prepared for this follow up movie to certainly be a dud (surely they can't have a second great movie).  But again, they have pulled it off with flying colors.  The picture quality is top notch, the sound is explosive and nuanced appropriately, with great detail and effective use of the surround channels.  The bass is powerful (if your system is up to the task) and will leave you shaking in your seat.  The movie is action packed, and I like that although the focus of the movie is still surrounding Captain Kirk, again the director takes plenty of time to explore the complicated dynamics of the relationships between Kirk/Spock and Spock/Uhura.  I am also glad that Lenard Nemoy gets to return, as I fear with his current health issues, it's possible he won't be around for a third movie, if they decide to make one.  All in all, this is an excellent movie, despite the glaring plot devices, one of which is way too far fetched in my opinion, even for Star Trek.  Don't buy the steelbook unless you don't mind that annoying piece of flappy cardboard hanging over the top edge.  Sure, you can remove it but the actual steelbook doesn't have any of the information printed on the back, which I don't understand, so I have to keep the stupid paper stuck to the back, that overlaps the top of the movie, and just doesn't look neat sitting in my blu ray stand.",1394323200,2,1894,4.476744186046512

Younger viewers who may not be familiar with the Wrath of Khan, and the stellar performance played by Ricardo Montalban, should enjoy the effort, however those who loved the original may be disappointed, as I was.

5290696,5,B009934S5M,The story of the crew of the enterprise is on another great adventure. Chris pine is very good as KIrk. The entire cast seems to have developed a chemistry which plays well off each other. It was time to bring STAR TREK back and boy this is a great follow up to the first in the series. Hopefully there are more to come. JJ Abrams has done it again,1393718400,,348,4.057971014492754
5290697,1,B009934S5M,"I grew up on TOS Star Trek. The original cast movies were hit and miss,(stick with the even numbered 2,4&6 original cast movies) but at least they were ORIGINAL. Right from the get go, this flick gives itself away. The plot is a series of invented events that make little sense to get the cast to a point in the story where they need to be for the next retarded series of events. Then there is the cast! The actor chosen to play the part of Kahn carried the role with all the presence of a house cat pretending to be a lion. I realize the original Kahn played by the late, great Ricardo Montalban would be a hard act to follow but seriously? A skinny Brit?.....it was sad to watch. And let us add up the unbelievably stupid aspects of this movie that the supposed ""alternate time line"" allowed......Klingons that look like cat people with too many body piercings,  a transporter that can send a person not just from earth to the moon, but over a hundred light years away, all the way to the flaming Klingon home world! Who needs a starship when you have a super transporter on steroids. What did JJ Abrams do to come up with that one? One too many beers? (yah, we'll say ""beers"")  Let's not forget the warp drive trip back to earth, alllll the way back from the Klingon home world. The script needed it to happen in minutes and not days sooooo lets do it AGAIN folks. Oh yah, now it was Kirk's turn to die saving the ship and not Spock's as in Star Trek 2....you're so original JJ. Oh yes, and let us not forget the part where a warp driven starship is hanging out UNDER WATER on some goofy planet. A dozen ways the Enterprise could have stayed outta sight from the primitive native inhabitants while they complete their planet saving mission but we needed a scene where the giant starship comes out of the sea cause its like way kool.....doesn't make any sense having Kirk violate the prime directive for no reason except to make the scene happen but its like totally kool looking so why not throw it in the mix. (sigh) IMO people that gave this movie 5 or 4 stars would have given it 5 or 4 stars even if it had talking tribbles take over the Enterprise. Seriously, can JJ Abrams get any more contrived in his scripts????? I know he wants to just make money using the ""Star Trek"" name but this movie is just sad & embarrassing. Why don't you throw in a few purple dinosaurs next time for the kiddies there JJ?",1393632000,31,2411,4.320088300220751

5290704,5,B009934S5M,"This was the first movie in many years that I've seen more than once in theaters.

I never watched any Star Trek series or movies previously, though I'd seen a few stray episodes and parts of movies.  I think what JJ Abrams has done with these two movies is brilliant.  He has opened the bridge to the world of Star Trek to a whole new generation.  Some may look down on those (like me) who weren't fans previously.  But what these updates do is make someone want to go back and see how it all began.  How can that be a bad thing?

I watched The Wrath of Khan before seeing Into Darkness (I mean, everyone 'knew' it would be Khan).  But not having a Star Trek background, I had no loyalties to the wonderful Ricardo Montalban.  I was enthralled through the entire movie.  I love the casting, I LOVE the score by Michael Giacchino (and can't stop listening to it).  I loved everything about Into Darkness.

In regards to the actual DVD/BluRay, I was disappointed to find out that the makers decided to split all of the extras over different sellers, meaning in order to get all the extras, you'd need to buy multiple copies.  BOO!  This however does not have an influence on my rating.  There's always YouTube for the extras.  Hopefully they will release a collective extras edition in the future.",1393545600,,1296,4.4743589743589745

5290706,5,B009934S5M,I would recommend the purchase of this movie by all lovers of fast paced action filled science fiction. The casting was superb and the story line was action packed from the beginning thru to the end. No sex other than implied romantic connections which was refreshing.

5290708,4,B009934S5M,"I've been a fan of Star Trek since it first aired, so I HAVE to buy anything Star Trek! The movie is good, though it has a couple of flaws. The whole thing of Kirk dying & Spock yelling Khan were taken directly from Wrath of Khan, with character changes. I felt that was kind of glaring, couldn't understand why so many people didn't see it as a rehashed scene from the original movie, then realized The Wrath Of Khan was released so long ago, a lot of people have never seen it, so this was all new to them! I like ST Into Darkness, Zak Quintos is an awesome Spock, and Cumberbatch is a great Khan (but not a Ricardo Montalblan).",1393545600,2,630,4.172131147540983

I am Originally a Trekkie (Star wars came later but don't let people tell you hat either your a Trekkie or a Star Wars fan.  One can be both), and love the Original cast & Show.  But when the Reboot came out.....I was REALLY impressed!
  With 2013's release of the second Trek reboot movie, it was bigger & better!  With Kahn gaining an ""Early"" release.  And a renegade High Ranking Star Fleet renegade that brought Kahn & his Eugenically (yep, I said it! Eugenically!) bred crew out earlier than in the original time line of the original Series (STTOS).  With Spock Prime giving current timeline Spock hints on how to overcome Kahn.

It looked great and the pacing was good. I just thought that the storyline was not as strong and the standard trimuvative of Kirk Spock McCoy was not at the right strength. To much effort was placed on the Spock Uhura relationship.

5290715,4,B009934S5M,"I grew up watching the original Star Trek TV series. I was a Trekkie then and still am. As much as I like the original Captain Kirk and Spock, I like these guys much better. Spock shows emotion. He has a ""girlfriend.""  I especially love how this movie uses the original Khan character (with a few changes from the original storyline in the 1960s). It's even better that Khan is played by the man who gives life to the best Sherlock Holmes ever. And the ending -- a great twist on an original script. This time Kirk almost dies and Spock mourns. Originally it was Spock who died - The ""one versus the Many"". Anyway, go get the movie and enjoy. I'd say this movie is too intense for kids under 13, but by that age kids have seen plenty of violence and partial nudity.",1393372800,,765,4.275862068965517

5290731,2,B009934S5M,"The sequel to the first ""Star Trek"", ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" was just a waste of time. The only reasons why it was popular and liked by most people are:

1. It's new (i.e. following the first ""Star Trek"" story)
2. It has ""Into Darkness"" in the title (ooooh, so scary-sarcasm, trust me, this movie was for children)

Use your brains, people. Just because it's a sequel doesn't automatically make it the best of the series. For example, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight rises were both awful sequels with predictable stories and pathetic action. The same goes for skyfall and iron man 3. Both were pathetic sequels. What are some worthy sequels that aren't pathetic then, you ask? Here's a short list:

1. Back to the Future II and III
2. Mission Impossible II and III
3. Spider-Man 2
4. X-Men 2

""Star Trek: into darkness"" was plain stupid on all levels. Here's why: The story was similar to the first ""Star Trek"" (meaning there was no creativity and effort by the writers to entertain and pique the interest of viewers), the main villain (Khan) was not menacing and evil (people's grandmother's are more evil than Khan was), the story lacked the suspense and action that the first ""Star Trek"" has, and it seems J.J. Abrams was too distracted by his upcoming ""Star Wars"" sequel to focus on developing a story to a movie worth watching.
Bottom line: Don't waste your money buying ""Star Trek: into darkness""; rent it or watch it for free.",1393113600,6,1441,4.6171875

Catastrophic things happen etc. and the movie ends by setting up Kirk & Co. with a completely new time line free from all those sticky continuity constraints.  PERFECT.

This movie features Kirk's arch-enemy Khan (previously played by Ricardo Montebon - now played by someone not nearly so cool - but really... who can out suave Rico).  Things happen, battle ensues, New Spock phones Old Spock (Nimoy) for some brotherly advice.  The good guys win.  You will be thoroughly entertained.

Perhaps it rings the chimes of a quasi-trekki such as myself but it did so in a well-written and well acted way.

If you have never had the chance to read Roddenbury's original (1968) ""The Making of Star Trek"", take the time to do so. It is as if the world we live in was taken into another context/realm. Creativity such as that probably only surfaces every couple generations or so and he absolutely did it!

These are better with your kids after they have seen or been briefed on the preceding movies/series.  Once they are up-to-date on all things ""Star Trek"", slip this Blu-ray into the player and enjoy!  This particular movie is very good, and gives a nod here and there to the original, as you will see.  The action is supreme and the story is a good one. Try to see ""Star Trek II, the Wrath of Kahn"" first, and it will all fall into place.",1392854400,,636,4.410256410256411

It had it all from emotion, to action, to a typical star trek feel. Can't wait to see the next one!",1392681600,,480,4.063157894736842
5290782,4,B009934S5M,"The galaxy again needs saving and the crew of the star ship Enterprise is save the day. In Star Trek: Into Darkness, Starfleet is in danger from a terrorist who seeks revenge and destruction upon them, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch, Sherlock). Captain Kirk (Chris Pine, Unstoppable), Spock (Zachary Quinto, Heroes), and Doctor McCoy (Keith Urban, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King) are determined to bring him to justice. Even if it means entering enemy space to the evil Klingon homework, Kronos.
J.J. Abrams returns to his revival of the science fiction epic: Star Trek, originally created by Gene Roddenberry, to deliver us this fast-paced, space-exploring film. It is a film with acting worthy enough for fans, but I am disappointed with its plot and the use of the characters in it.
The terrorist, John Harrison, seeks revenge on Starfleet and plots the destruction of the archives in London. Seeking Harrison, Kirk and the Enterprise crew seek him on the planet, Kronos. After a battle where Harrison nearly single handedly defeats a host of battle-hardened Klingons, he surrenders to save his crew who are, unknowingly to Kirk, on the broken down Enterprise. There he is questioned by Kirk and is revealed to be the legendary Khan, a genetically engineered war criminal bred to be superior in everything.
One of my biggest problems with this movie is that the role of the villain isn't solely on Khan, but is partially also on Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller, Robocop), who backstabs the Enterprise to silence Khan. My problem is that Khan is THE villain; the greatest adversary the Enterprise of the original series has ever faced, later emphasized by Spock Prime (Leonard Nemoy). The character Khan is fueled by the need for revenge. In Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan, he has the urge to find and kill Captain Kirk, portrayed by William Shatner. Now, in Into Darkness he is filled with rage to kill Admiral Marcus. My expectation of the film was that it would be similar to Wrath of Khan, however it fell short. My hope for the future of this franchise is that Khan will return in some way to seek Kirk.
Also, I am disappointed with Spocks use of emotion. Emotionlessness is a staple of the character Spock and to break it is cruel. One of the best castings of the film is Zachary Quinto as Spock, butthe plot just destroyed the character. For example, having a romantic relationship with Uhuru. Spock is supposed to find emotion confusing and useless, not show it actively. Some people might argue that Spock is emotional because of the death of his mother and home planet, Vulcan. This is a plausible explanation, but Vulcans are known for their control of emotion or something very bad could happen.
J.J. Abrams continues to show his skills as a director. The special effects are superior to any movie of the year. For acting, Benedict Cumberbatch makes his first appearance to the American public after a successful run with BBC on the show Sherlock as Sherlock Holmes. In Into Darkness, Cumberbatch is outstanding as Khan. Keith Urban showed great skill playing McCoy with using great metaphors, a characteristic of McCoy. The role of Captain Kirk was reprised by Chris Pine, whose performance was adequate.
Overall, J.J. Abrams uses the alternate reality to successfully revive Star Trek. Into Darkness is a great movie for the fans but compared to the original films, there are major flaws in the film. I recommend seeing this movie to anyone, so they can enjoy it and also critique it like I have. Hopefully, Khan will return.",1392595200,2,3547,4.864462809917355

5290818,3,B009934S5M,"As I was watching this film I thought to myself ....

1) This is visually impressive, but it fails to capture the soul and heart that was Star Trek

2) Modern day computer animation is technically impressive, but it does not substitute for a great engaging story

3) If the movie was made using another title and other character names, one would not really know it was Star Trek - it could be any space movie.

4) It seemed more rip off than homage to literally use scenes almost identical to Wrath of Khan

We recently discovered the web series STAR TREK CONTINUED
It is designed to pick up where the 60s series left off.
They did an EXCELLENT job of capturing the essence of what made Star Trek powerful ------  engaging story, morality plays and close character relations.

We have enjoyed these web episodes more than the recent rebooted Star Trek big budget movies.

Another thought ---- with movies being so heavily CGI driven these days, it is shame these animators do not get more credit for the movies.
Technically what they are doing with objects, characters, sequences, shading, textures, etc... is impressive.
They spend thousands of hours to make a movie like this.

In a movie like this one, the CGI is literally 70% of the film.
The live action actors almost seem like secondary in importance.
That is a shame in 2 ways.

The actors are not as important as they would have been in something like the original Star Trek where the show is more actor and character driven.
However the actors still get the limelight along with the director.

By contrast, the general public never really knows the nameless, faceless teams of computer artists and animators who spend so much work to make a heavy computer driven film like this.

So while it was OK to watch -- this visual CGI extravaganza is not something we found engaging -- nor would we care to add it to our collection or ever watch again.

Technically well done -- but missing that magic ingredient that makes a film truly memorable",1392249600,3,1998,4.626062322946176

If you saw the first movie, BUY this one because it's even better in some regards than the first. The relationship between Spock and Kirk escalates to emotional levels and is very well done. And that's the tip of the iceberg. The action, cinematics, special effects, acting, story - all of it is top-notch.

I did want to mention that since this summary (not in-depth review), I've watched the series ""Sherlock"" on NetFlix, which stars Benedict Cumberbatch (plays Khan in ST:ID). He is a superb actor and definitely has been ranked up high on my short list of great male actors. He plays the baddie role so very well in this film, and it's worth watching for his performance alone (though, as stated previously, the acting is great all around).",1392249600,,867,4.62987012987013

The good. You will be entertained.  The cast is still good in their roles.

The bad.  The director and writers tried to force too much old stuff form the previous movies into this one.  There are too many scenes from many of the old movies they changed a bit and forced into here.  The movie didn't seem original at all, it was almost uncomfortable to watch at times.

The worse thing though is not who the villian was or that he was in the movie, but they ruined him totally. To me, he is, with Vader, at the top of the list of the best sci-fi villians of all time. The actor who played him was good, but was mis cast.  How about someone with much more charisma (The Rock, Dwayne Johnson?).  His charcter was not even close to what we remember as the original.  No depth, no charisma at all.

So there it is...the reason I pretty much resent this movie is they ruined the Villian. If you watch the movie, you will know what I mean.",1392163200,6,1129,4.109589041095891

5290869,2,B009934S5M,"I have to say I am disappointed. There is little in this film that is original other than the beginning.

Sure, in the initial film of this new series it was important to pre-establish the relationships we saw in the original series, but this film reaches back to that prior work for it's strengths, then reaches back even further to prior films and the original series for the plot. Throw in a renegade Fleet Commander with thin motivation to break all the rules and there you have at tired slog through the story.

If you like a lot of fight scenes this is a good but not great film.

Hardware fans will love the new ""Dreadnaught Class"" star ship, which echoes the great leap forward in battleship design of Edwardian England before the First World War and continues the welcome Roddenberry et. al. tradition of selecting storied motifs from earlier ages to express artistic intent in the future. We hope the next film writers return this tremendous special effect, as it left the viewer with at least something new and exciting to look at during a long 2 hours.

Rather than a few references to historical marks as reference points for the viewer, this film is a remake with altered scenes, has some fun interludes between the characters, but otherwise has a wholesale borrow from the past, or perhaps the future, as Spock calls up his future self and asks him ""What did you do in this situation?"", he tells him, then our new fresh faced crew of NCC-1701 does exactly that.

Took the package inside and got a knife to open it up when I realized all the stamps were Iraqi, do I know anyone in Iraq right now? No.... What is this, I inspected the box and noticed that there was writing in Arabic all over the box in biro, it was marked from Iraqi/ Kurdistan region post. I suddenly felt uncomfortable opening the box after watching too much of a CIA series this week and reading too much about Sochi threats today. So I called a couple of people and everyone agreed the box shouldn't be opened. My curiosity started eating away at me. The internet said to put the box outside the house and call 911. It seemed a bit drastic so wrapped it up in plastic bags (because that would stop a chemical weapon from leaking out) and drove down to the sheriffs office downtown. At reception I got in trouble for getting in the car with the package but they said I did the right thing not opening it. The 4 officers on duty called their supervisor to come down, I think in a calm city with not much but regular burglaries and drugs everyone got quite excited. The sheriff came to see me and asked me lots of questions, he said we should wait for the canine (k-9?) unit before we continue and then we'll open it depending on how the dogs react. So my toddler India and I sat and waited for a while, she got a shiny silver junior sheriffs badge that entertained her the entire time. A couple of men arrived, starting speaking to the sheriff and they took the package off. When they returned they all went into a contained room that I could see from where I was waiting. They talked for a while and then they opened the box. The door opened and they invited us in, all I could think was oh my goodness please say it's not a key ring or a pair of knickers I can't remember ordering online (the box was seriously light). I walk into the room and they are holding up the contents of the box............ Star Trek - Into Darkness. It was a very poor quality black market DVD box that they were afraid to open until they had confirmed that I had ordered it. I actually did order it, weeks and weeks and weeks ago and when it didn't arrive on time I called amazon and they shipped me a brand new blu-ray copy overnight. They opened the box and there was a pirate DVD in there, not quite the anthrax I was expecting because obviously a work from home mom in the mountains of North Carolina is a perfect target.... But they were still pretty excited. One of them said the box is the most suspicious they'd ever seen in asheville, the other taught a training course on how to spot counterfeit products, I let them keep it all much to their surprise. I can't help but wonder how I would have reacted if the box was postmarked Hawaii.... I don't know anyone there but I'm sure I would have opened it. Makes me sad that everyone in a war filled country gets put in a danger category in my head, even the average joe just trying to run a black market DVD business through amazon.......",1391731200,4,3165,4.224422442244224

The DVD audio quality was somewhat better, but, still [and I've noticed this with other Blu-ray and DVD movies] sound is simply not robust enough on many of these disks.  What causes that?  Picture quality is otherwise great; I have a very good Sony Blu-ray/DVD player, and, it is attached to a name-brand flat-screen TV.  These have notoriously poor sound projection anyway, but, the sloppy sound quality here is due to something in the manufacture of the disks themselves.  The movie, i.e., story/cast/script/special effects/clever and unique Star Trek continuity via a new timeline, etc., is definitely FIVE-STAR.

5290913,4,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness directed by J.J. Abrams was a suspenseful and an action-packed sequel. Like his 2009 movie Star Trek, this movie will have you on the edge of your seats.  The timing of this movie takes place one year after the first movie in the series. This is one of the most explosive, action packed, thrillers I watched all year.
When the crew of the Enterprise is called back home, they find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization that has detonated the fleet and everything it stands for, leaving their world in a state of crisis. With a personal score to settle, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction. As our heroes are propelled into an epic chess game of life and death, love will be challenged, friendships will be torn apart, and sacrifices must be made for the only family Kirk has left, his crew.
After watching the first movie Star Trek, I had a really good feel for the characters and the new actors. This made the movie really come to life that much more for me.  Being a person who loves all the movies in the Star Trek franchise, I would defiantly have to recommend this one. Although movies are more action packed than the series it does have that overwhelming appeal that any star trek lover can relate to.
The special effects in my opinion where great. They really added a new futuristic look to the Enterprise in its earlier years and will probably add some interest in the eyes of a generation that missed out on the early series.  The further we get into the future and the computer generated age, the greater these special effects are going to be, in my opinion. I think the viewer will agree. There is something to be said about flying through space on the Enterprise those appeals to every sci-fi lover out there.
My overall reaction is, I hope they keep making the dreams of Gene Roddenberry come to life. I really enjoyed this film and hopefully hadnt given much of the plot away. Its a must see, a two thumbs up from this Trekky.",1391385600,,2053,4.483957219251337

5290926,4,B009934S5M,"As much as I liked Abrams' 2009 re-boot of the Star Trek series, I liked this second installment better. I think that's because there was less of an obligation to fill up back-story, and more ability to go deeper both into plot, and into the emotions of these new, younger versions of the characters we now (re) know. Add to that Benedict Cumberbatch makes a complex and compelling villain, even if the character does borrow from other sources, including Rutger Hauer in ""Blade Runner"".

The humor is funny, the emotional scenes have a real impact, the battles are exciting, the acting is excellent, the plot twists are
clever, and the more epic 'big' moments are really effective.

There are flaws; some plot twists can be seen coming a mile off, there are a few painful cheats or jumps in logic, and a handful of too-easy coincidences. But for a big summer blockbuster this has more smarts, style, punch and humanity than most.",1391299200,,929,4.728395061728395

Rather, I find it inspiring & heart-warming re: friendship/courage/sacrifice, etc. in addition to the action & obvious struggles of good vs. bad guys (and how some characters are in between). I own the original STAR TREK movie set with Capt Kirk/William Shatner as well as the Enterprise series movies with Capt Picard (through Amazon).

Older fans will find some of their favorite subplots but with a new twist, while newer fans will love the technical aspects and computer generated special effects.

5290963,3,B009934S5M,"[As with the last movie, the polarizing effect of Star Trek Into Darkness requires that The Rotten Review accept reviews from our satellite office in the Evil Mirror Universe; As in 2009, the Evil side cheated and gets the last word.]

THE GOOD UNIVERSE SAYS:
Star Trek is back and cooler than ever!!  When John Harrison, a mysterious evil genius, declares a one-man war on Star Fleet, its up to Kirk to stop him.  Taking the USS Enterprise into hostile territory, Kirk will risk interplanetary war to bring this mysterious enemy to justice.  Once Kirk faces his new foe - far from home and surrounded by enemies - dark secrets will be revealed which may threaten the very existence of Star Fleet and demand that the crew of the Enterprise make the ultimate sacrifice.

My name is.

Star Trek proves its still full of surprises.  From the true identity of John Harrison to the inner characters of the crew of the Enterprise.  The visuals are amazing.  Space, so bland and boring on episodes of TNG, is now blazing with energy.  The story moves at warp speeds and never lets up.  If you're into sci-fi movies bursting with energy, this is your movie.

BUT THE EVIL UNIVERSE RESPONDS:
 Trek Into Darkness is both original and greatbut never both at the same time.  Rather, the best parts of the story are so derivative that you're more likely to enjoy it if you're NOT a Trekker.  That way you won't recognize plot ideas used in previous movies (and one plot idea basically lifted whole from a memorable  if not canonical  Star Trek novel).

Luckily, this liberal borrowing only occurs when Trek Into Darkness actually tells a story, and there are vast stretches where that doesnt happen.  Instead, we get cute scenes of Kirk being an arrogant jerk, cute scenes where Spock and Uhura will choose inopportune moments for a lovers spat, cute moments where people drop hints on famous Trek moments (Harry Mudd, Tribbls, etc), and Alice Eves gratuitous underwear moment.  When  Trek Into Darkness remembers that its supposed to be telling a story it does so sloppily.  Instead of having its characters navigate the plot using their instinct and their reason, Trek Into Darkness settles for having characters just TELL us what the plot is.  The characters prove so ineffective that its questionable whether they really are characters and not simply people around whom the story unfolds by itself.  Its like we could have replaced the crew of the Enterprise at the last minute and the story would have been the same.

My name is!!!

The biggest surprise is the identity of John Harrison  Trekkies like me hashed their theories about that one months ahead of the movies release. However, the real surprise isn't WHO Harrison really is, but HOW irrelevant it is in the end.  Like the rest of the story, we learn the secretwhen its just told to us.  Like the main characters, Harrisons identity could have been switched with no change to the overall story.  Its sort of like an Agatha Christie mystery without a murder  the butlerdid something.

can we do something about these lights!?!?

Following the example of the last movie, Trek Into Darkness is gloriously vivid, perhaps a bit too vivid.  Once again, the interiors of starships built by an advanced civilization of human beings will either be these rooms flooded with light OR these dirty industrial areas that look like the factory floor at Anheuser-Busch.  The exterior shots of spacecraft are more beautiful than anything seen before in Trek, but less elaborate than the first several movies, especially the Run Silent, Run Deep space combat scenes from Wrath of Khan.  Nothing on screen can distract you from the lack of original plot or compelling characters.

I would have been willing to wait an extra few years for a Trek movie that actually came up with an original story. Is that so difficult?  There are hordes of Trek fan projects on the web that have (at least) a good story to distract from bargain-basement visuals. This bodes poorly for JJ Adamss planned future projects (or should that be poorly does this bode).  In short, if you like your sci-fi with a strong plot and unique characters, this is NOT your movie.",1390953600,,4177,4.788811188811189

My mom is a big fan of the show, and by that I mean the OG Star Trek featuring Shatner as James Kirk and Nimoy as Spock.  This series out of all the other iterations of Star Trek is also my favorite.

When the reboot of Star Trek by Abrams came out in 2009, I was bit skeptical but I was pleasantly surprised by how GREAT it was.  I had high expectations for Into Darkness and I can't say I was disappointed.  I really enjoyed Into Darkness, it certainly had its moments, but I still think the first film was slightly better.  I'm a fan of the series so I actually pre-ordered it on Amazon and it arrived the day the movie was released in stores.  If you don't have Amazon Prime, sign up for it - it's amazing!  Abrams did a great job with this series (so far?) and my hope is there will be a third movie in the near future.

The dialogue is witty and mature with none of the verbosity of an Aaron Sorkin type script (I cannot stand when characters instantly reply with perfectly crafted mini speeches). There are so many great moments, including small ones, such as Kirk wondering what the heck an argument between Spock and Uhura (his non-Vulcan girlfriend) would be like.

I, at the time *loved* all the movies and was starting to get into Voyager and Deep Space Nine as well. Toward the middle of Voyager, the writing went in the tank and spilled over into (Star Trek) Enterprise and The Next Gen movie Nemesis.

By the time Star Trek '09 came around, I was really hoping that it would get me back into the franchise; as at that point, I had about given up that there would ever be another series or movie. As it turned out ""Star Trek"" was, in my opinion, just perfect and amazing in every way and made Star Trek fun to watch again.

Now, I was aware that there were supposedly to be three movies and when the seemingly forever nameless ""Star Trek Sequel"" (later known as ""Into Darkness"" came around, I was really excited.

I'm not really sure what it was about ""Into Darkness"" but I just didn't get the same thrill I did when I saw ST '09. The cast is once again great and I still love Karl Urban's McCoy dearly, but something felt off. Maybe it was the fact that they toyed around with the beautifully done ""Wrath of Khan"" and flipped a few things around. I actually found the outcome of the last few scenes predictable and anti-climatic, which was disappointing for me. I was hoping for a fresh plot this time; but it is entertaining and looking at Chris Pine for a couple hours is never a bad thing.

I am so happy that this man took this legendary franchise and made it what it is today. The cast returns bigger and better than ever which two awesome antagonists. Peter Weller, while everyone knows his talent is someone I had never expected to portray a Star Trek villain and he did an amazing job, but Benedict Cumberbatch, was phenomenal. He brought so much passion and feeling to this character that it made him more than just a classic black and white villain and I am so angry that he didn't get an Oscar nomination for his character. The plot is easy and complex all at the same time and each character gets just enough screen time including new comer to the case Alice Eve. The special effects are incredible and I loved the fact that a good portion of the film took place on Earth and it was really cool to see a much more in depth look at Earth in the Star Trek Universe.

I am a first generation Trekker so am fussy about variations of Star Trek.  This film had me on edge of my seat and completely enthralled from beginning to end.  I was very skeptical of another actor portraying Khan other than the fantastic Ricardo Montalban, especially a British actor, but Benedict Cumberbatch nailed this role cold.  I really like his role in the contemporary version of Sherlock Holmes and now as Khan, he was amazing.  I did not even hesitate to pre-order a copy of this film when Amazon offered it for $14.00 and free shipping/handling.  I have watched it twice already and still enjoy it.  I highly recommend reading the novelization of this film as it explains why James T. Kirk at the beginning of the film has stolen a highly prized/sacred scroll from a temple.  Even though this is an alternative history Star Trek film, I just could not see this Kirk being a thief.  The book explains very well why.

When Star Trek first premiered in the early '60's my parents didn't let me watch it so I had to wait until reruns aired when I was in junior high school.  My friends and I all were into the show and I've seen them all many times.  I never enjoyed any of the subsequent iterations of Trek or the movies with the original cast either.  JJ Abrams has done strong work reviving this geriatric franchise.  His first Trek film was excellent and I think ""Into Darkness"" is even better.  Having these stories as a prequel works well and his casting crew finding actors who closely resemble the original characters is impressive.  I think someone needs to do DNA testing on Zach Quinto as his Spock so closely resembles Leonard Nimoy they have to be related.  I know some reviewers were unhappy with the reboot of the Kahn villain and storyline but as Ricardo Montalban has gone off to ""fine Corinthian leather"" heaven Benedict Cumberbatch fills in just fine.  The action is non-stop, the sets and special effects are superb; at the end seeing the majestic Enterprise re-built and ready for the ""5-year"" mission with the classic theme playing made this old Trek fan happy.

I'm in my late twenties. So, I never really got into the original series; however, I did very much enjoy all of the movies, even the so-called bad ones, before the Abrams ""reboot.""

I realize this taints my prospective; however, watching Into Darkness, I could not help but feel a little sadness, sadness for such a great franchise completely lost in a modern action movie. Sure the movie was entertaining, but it wasn't ""Star Trek,"" it was something else. Kirk behaving like an idiot. Spock engaging in a emotional relationship with Uhura. Crew members undressing on duty and asking Kirk to look away. Threesomes. Come on, what is this? The entire movie felt like someone watched Star Trek II, once, and wrote a screen play off that. That isn't how Star Trek worked so successfully for all of these years. In the old days, men and women put together a seamless package that millions loved. Now, they just come up with an action movie plot and call it Star Trek.

Sure, your relative who isn't a Star Trek fan might like the movie. But, your relative probably won't even remember that the movie was a ""Star Trek"" movie next year. If you are a true Trekker and spent years watching the Star Trek series work so perfectly together prior to Enterprise and now this, you'll be disappointed..",1389916800,24,1453,4.627906976744186
5291071,1,B009934S5M,"I've been a Trek fan since I first watched reruns of TOS as a kid.  I had to be talked into seeing the first Abrams movie, given that most of the recent time travel related Trek stories have been annoying at best, but I was pleasantly surprised with the initial ""reboot."" The first movie managed to tastefully set up to recreate the Trek universe (necessary if you understand the rules established for time travel in the Trek universe.) That being said... I saw this movie the day it came out and HATED it. It seems like everything that was done right with the first movie, was done exactly wrong in this one.

I was actually hoping they would revisit the Khan storyline, but the entire second half is almost a literal retelling of ""Wrath of Khan"" with a few annoying twists. The result is flat out insulting to long time fans. Khan was bound to show up in the new timeline, but let's take advantage of the reboot and make a completely new story. Nope, sorry - we're going to start with what might be a new story (and as pointed out in another review, the ""rogue Admiral"" thing has been done before and much better) and dump it straight into ""Wrath of Khan."" Once the plot turns, you can predict the rest of the movie (again, about half way through.) The role reversal between Kirk and Spock is predictable from the time you see the regurgitated storyline coming (I mean come on - way to obvious and clich.)  Additionally, there was no reason for Carol Marcus to be there except as a really strained reference to a story which happened much later in the original timeline. I didn't much care for the idea of Spock contacting his older self for advice either.

I have read a lot of complaints about the plot. The real problem is they tried to cram too many story lines into a single movie, which left no room to really develop of complete most of them. Almost every story line gets dropped about mid way through for the ""Wrath of Khan"" parody.

As far as special features go, I really DON'T CARE!  This is a major problem I have had since DVD's came along, and it's only gotten worse with Blu Ray. Production companies pile on special features to try to justify the jacked up price they want for the Blu Ray version, and what are you actually getting for it? A few deleted scenes, or interesting production tidbits you might watch ONCE? Just give me the movie, and I'm happy.

In the end, it is Trek, and I will eventually have to buy it to complete my collection (simply because I own all of the other Trek movies.) Just not until the price comes down to about $10 or maybe $15. I do sincerely hope the next installment gets the series back on track, but it looks like Abrams, like most of Hollywood, is trying to market to the ""Ooooh, shiny!"" mentality.",1389916800,18,2754,4.409448818897638

The middle of the film is OK, with some unexpected plot twists and some material (and an occasional actor) that you would swear was plucked from the following: ""Heroes,"" ""Doctor Who,"" and ""Star Wars."" Unfortunately the build up to a climax and resolution is not done well in this film, and the end seems rushed even though the rest of the film seems too long.  I will not go into detail to avoid a ""spoiler.""

The interesting part though is that the film manages to make a cohesive timeline with the rest of Star Trek history despite being in the alternate time universe.  It pays homage to the original Star Trek movies in a unique way.  Pay careful attention to the dream-state mental ""voices"" Kirk hears while in the transition back 3/4 of the way through the film...

5291085,2,B009934S5M,"It's long been apparent that major Hollywood producers care almost entirely about profit, and little about craft, so it doesn't shock me when big budget action movies turn out to be boring and juvenile. They make so much money with explosions and fights and non-stop action, why bother worrying about petty concerns like good scriptwriting and plot believability?

But one of the main reasons I was so disappointed with Into Darkness is because Star Trek '09 was such a fine and enjoyable movie. I am not an Abrams fan, so I had very low expectations for his Star Trek. Maybe I should have just kept them low for this one too, but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have helped. Into Darkness is loud, crass, ridiculous, cliche-filled and poorly written. Zero character development, zero plot believability.

Somehow, Abrams has taken one of the strengths of the last movie, casting, and turned it into a weakness. Chris Pine was
charming and roguish despite his immaturity in Star Trek. In this movie he comes off as a selfish fool, who is inexplicably forgiven for every nitwitted thing he does. Spock comes off as an emotional baby. Uhura acts like a spurned teenage girl.

And Scotty? They've turned his character into an absolute clown. The original Scotty was always good for a few yuks, but he was also dead serious about his craft, and never ran around like some chicken with his head cutoff, just for cheap comic relief.

Go ruin Star Wars, Abrams. And good riddance.",1389830400,15,1469,4.794466403162056

I really liked the first movie and this one is even better, so much so I can hardly wait until the next one comes out. 5 stars is just not a high enough rating as far as I am concerned. If you are a fan of the original series just sit back, relax, and try not to compare the two movies until after you watch this all the way through.

Great picture quality - I once read a review that said watching the opening scene on a super-HD set up with good speakers was like ""multiple eye orgasms."" They were so right. Beautiful HD / HDX quality.

To be 100% open, I would rank the Star Trek (2009) movie as my favorite movie of all time, so take this 5-star rating with a pinch of salt if you didn't like that movie.

5291150,2,B009934S5M,"Jar-Jar Abrams' Star Treks still look like a bunch of children stole some really expensive equipment and made a couple of poorly scripted homage films. Of the two, this one is truly bad. What is it, opposites day in the writers lounge? If you sit through this mess, you'll know what I mean. I suppose the ADHD Gen will like it for all the flashing lights and nausea inducing camera work. Most of the time I was just thinking to myself, ""Is that guy supposed to be Scotty or is he Bones?""

If you liked it, great. Bully for you. No need to disparage my review as it won't change my mind (actually, if I had written what I truly thought of the film I would most likely be banned from user comments on Amazon forever).

All that said, I gave it two stars because Amazon's HD streaming through my Roku box is fantastic and the product itself (never mind the artistic content) was delivered flawlessly as usual.

**** **** ****
One last thing (and it may be a bit of a spoiler)... it's something my wife pointed out: Why did they need Khans blood when they had 72 other supermen in the cargo hold?

This is an attempted re-make in many ways. New material would have been better for Khan cannot be outdone by actor Ricardo Montalban. The Wrath Of Khan is amazing and in comparison to this film...we'll it makes it just some cheap imitation. Sorry folks, that's my opinion.",1389312000,15,430,4.746666666666667

5291166,3,B009934S5M,"Frankly, I was disappointed. This film featured a rousing, encouraging beginning, in much the same spirit and style as Abrams first shot out of the chute (which was damn good). Yet, after maybe the first hour, the movie-makers seemed to run out of script (or creativity, or energy), and turned to filler drawn from the original TV franchise...like high school students looking at a term paper deadline, and desperately grasping at straws. It simply did not work. I'm afraid that this might mean the death-knell for the ST franchise...which would be a terrific shame.

I did purchase the item, but only because I am a die-hard fan...and because a good chunk at the beginning of the picture was in the best tradition of this genre...and Roddenberry's creation, but, toward the end, you might as well make a john break or head for the popcorn counter (or make a few phone calls). Very amateurish.",1389225600,,893,4.836601307189542

5291170,3,B009934S5M,"It was great to see Noel Clarke (with a sly four beats-rest score in one scene) in the movie's standout performance where he carries important setup scenes. Unfortunately, the promise doesn't deliver.

After that strong kick-off, the facile-yet-spectacular light and effects show starts it's spiralling; The spaghetti-like twisty story has the equivalent loose ends, lines are lifted verbatim from earlier movies, very evident character inconsistencies, most humor falls flat, cartoon physics, tons of unrealistic personal violence but no blood is shed, lots of overly long and overacted scenes that need trimming, spectacular fire-fights go on too long, and too much fan-boy fodder that is a waste of screen time. In comparison to the older characters in this movie, with solid performances, the crew of the Enterprise come off like pretty idiot poster boys from a Heinlein story. Actors Urban and Pegg are woefully underutilized, often just punctuating scenes. Cumberbatch's uber-baddie just comes off as a very, very, angry fop. Spock has Spock's Skype ID... cool, but so what? In one scene there's even obvious vignetting when a wide angle lense is used. The Spock/Uhuru dialog is beyond grating. Overall, it's like the movie has been produced and churned out mechanically, warts and all, with little originality and a focus on profit over art.

The score by Michael Giacchino is subtle and brilliant.

The streaming started off with frequent macroblocking in the first few minutes, as usual with the Instant Video service but settled down for the rest of the movie. The second and third viewings were streamed flawlessly.",1389225600,3,1626,5.294573643410852
5291171,2,B009934S5M,"I have been a Star Trek fan for decades.  This movie was a flop, period.  The screen layout and the special effects were above average, but the storyline was a throwback with no new or interesting plot.  I expected more and got less.  All this was is a cash generator.  Apparently the production group has run out of ideas and figures one last hooray from the gullible public on their way out.",1389225600,12,393,4.402777777777778

5291173,5,B009934S5M,"This movie was AWESOME.  It's the first time I've seen it, and the best part about this film is no dragging.  It just kept going.  There was no overload of characters hogging for screen time, AND the Starships were NOT the stars or main focus of the story.  They were simply vehicles to the story.  I believe the time in this movie was fun and useful, and nothing was wasted.

Just as a movie, this was very exciting, but for Star Trek fans the opposite similarities of the ""then/now"" situations were pretty cool to watch.  It was just enough to be enjoyable, but not too long.  It was WORTH the rental price!  I highly recommend this movie.",1389225600,,641,4.410256410256411

I do not hold that sentiment as this is quite entertaining and puts us in the past for the characters. I enjoyed the other films and many of the TV series, especially the first in the 1960's.

We can only hope that any future Star Trek films will address the subject matter as Roddenberry did in his original series on TV.

Why pay $25 for half the content? I rented it from Netflix and watched it 3 times. When the price dropped to $8 it made it a little easier to purchase, although I am still annoyed about it. As for the film, I do like it, (SPOILER AHEAD) I almost wish they hadn't made such a big deal about the bad guy being Khan; I know they are rewriting canon, and I get it, but this guy, as good a bad guy as he was, could have been anyone. The discs themselves play fine, no problems, and I did like what extras there were.

5291218,5,B009934S5M,This episode of the Star Trek franchise is very appealing and provides a plausible explanation for the feature Star Trek movie: The Wrath of Khan.  Excellent production with very few dark scenes to undercut an otherwise superior movie.,1389052800,,235,5.184210526315789

The video and audio are sensational with 7.1 sound track which is the only reason I spent the eight bucks for it.  It is better, than than the first outing of this group who often look ridiculous.  For instance, I guess in the future Kirk got his rough skin smoothed out, his eyes uncrossed, and his upper lip reduced!  Spock takes getting used to since it appears that at a younger age he was more irritating -- and Scotty -- check out the original Star Trek TV series and you'll see the late actor looking young and rather handsome -- this one looks like he stepped into an instant ageing machine.  Not too bad with Bones and the Russian, although the original Russian was much better looking.",1389052800,3,765,4.5144927536231885

People complain that it's not an original story line--That's because it's a different time-line with our beloved characters and  new actors to bring another generation into the Star Trek fold. Solid past stories tied into the new cast. Now that this has been done, they can move into new adventures--if they can afford the rising cost of the cast members. Now the movie itself.....plot, standard jokes, cinematography, computer graphics,  all very good. This is not going to win over old fans, we are already there. Again, this is to win over new ones.

What this movie does is update TV Star Trek's story of ""Botany Bay"" and the deportation of the genetically modified super-humans.  Bernard Cumberbatch, as usual, does a great job of acting Khan.  He is brilliant, sinister, and superbly sinister. He steals the show, as well he should.  The cg space-opera warfare gets amazingly! better and better.  The plot is better than the original, of course, since they now have more to work with.  I am very happy with the new adaptions.  More stories, please?",1389052800,,645,4.844036697247707

It feels like the perfect blend. The changes make for greater intrigue. I just plain loved every minute of it. I also like how it is so very clear that all these characters save each other's butts over and over with cleverness, with skills, with standing together. The loyalty in every scene builds them into a formidable team... and the kind of team we know from TOS.

My husband who wouldn't know a star trek character from a Muppet, enjoyed the movie with no background knowledge at all. He didn't even see the first new Star Trek.  ""What is a Tribble?"" was his only question.",1388966400,,733,4.503759398496241

I feel they were good in their respective roles collectively but having been a Star Trek fan from the original series of course I couldn't help making comparisons. IMO Zachary Quinto was the best cast member. His role as Spock was well played & well received but of course he alone could not carry the whole film. This version doesn't rise to the level of some of the Star Trek movies but for a remake with new actors, it held it's own.",1388966400,,531,4.373737373737374

This movie has a good cast of the young crew of the USS Enterprise as the Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Ohura, and Bones. I guess the love affair between Spock and Ohura is necessary. The drama and action makes the movie exciting and suspenseful. I wonder now that Klingon territory has been violated, if the future sequel will feature combat between Star Fleet and the Klingons in addition to exploring new worlds.

This was a fast moving movie that kept your attention and your interest for the duration.

It's a movie with lots of action, lots of inside, and outside humor.  It laughs at itself, and hell even those who made it apologized for some of it.
I don't see why they had too, but I guess to make all the Trolls online settle down.
This is a fun, intense, and great sci-fi flick.  Pop up some popcorn, get the kids, friends, family, or just yourself.  Sit back relax, and don't take it so seriously.  Just enjoy it like a kid would, and have fun.",1388707200,,682,4.183206106870229

The original cast and Next Gen. movies were pretty hit or miss - some were enjoyable, one or two were really good, but most were pretty either ""meh"" or downright awful. When I saw the new JJ Abrams Trek I didn't have any high expectations but I ended up loving it. This sequel is just as good or better. This movie revisits themes from the original series and one of the better movies, but because we're in the new timeline established by Abrams' fist Trek, they are handled in a new and interesting way. I don't want to spoil anything, so it suffices to say that my 15yo son, who never saw the original material, liked it on it's own merits, while I - who was a fan of the source material - thought it was handled well and was able to appreciate the twists they added.

I give the movie itself five stars. This edition, however, only gets four stars. There are a few interesting featurettes on the disc, but no deleted scenes, gag reel, or insight on the score.  While I'm of the opinion that studios often over do it when it comes to bonus features, I think Paramount went a little too strongly in the opposite direction here.

It has to be remembered that the Star Trek reality has been shifted, so people and events are going to be different than they were in the olden days.  The entire reboot of the franchise has opened so many possibilities for the franchise, and those possibilities are fascinating.

I found this one to be more straight-forward than the previous film as it's more of a chess match instead of a Terminator/Back To The Future-style time traveling mindbender. Abrams has done really well rebooting this, now I hope we can get into some more original stories. He could complete a trilogy easy enough focusing on some huge battle with the Klingons and throwing one more Beastie Boys song our way in the third, but hopefully we'll see more original adventures with this crew eventually.

I take pride in that fact.  That's not enough, however, to keep this franchise going.  I did not favor the first J.J. Abrams film.  I do this one, maybe perhaps because the writers are known Star Trek aficionados.  In any event, this film is certainly ""Star Trek,"" which to any fan means this: a film about loyalties to your friends and, ultimately, what it means to be human.

5291379,5,B009934S5M,"When I heard they were going to tackle this one particular story which was an original series classic, I was skeptical.  Why do it when it was already so clearly defined especially with the follow up movie, also a Star Trek classic.  This is a totally totally distinct movie.  They don't try to recreate or repeat the plot of the original episode or the movie. I have to say that given the plot twist of the alternate timeline and it's effect on what followed, I thought they did quite a good job.  While he did an excellent job, I wasn't and still am not sure that Benedict Cumberbatch was ideal casting.  He played  a splendid villain though.

J.J. Abram's approach always seem to create a more complex character and expand on their motivations and formative experience to make you see them as more than just good and bad guys, heroes or villains.  Here they did just that.  I have to say that the action sequences were in keeping with the standard of action flicks with it's fast pacing and outlandish stunts.  The special effects were off the charts, and the twist at the crucial point of the movie was, for me, unexpected.  Again, they presented the characters more interestingly, making them more human.  There was also some humorous moments especially with Scotty and McCoy.

They could've actually given Karl Urban some more aspects as he seemed to be channeling Deforest Kelly at times.  He was so spot on with the mannerisms.  Perhaps in the next movie.  Don't get me wrong , Karl Urban is an good actor and is perfect for this part, it's just he could have had more to do.  Frankly this movie, for me, rates right up there with ""Wrath of Khan"", ""First Contact"" and the first one with Chris Pine.  Chris Pine plays Kirk with equal swagger as William Shatner without actually seeming to or want to recreate the Shatner experience.  Just enough of the mannerisms but then embellishing and updating the character.  Zachary Quinto was brilliant casting as Spock, bringing his own approach to the part..  Enough can't be said at how he has embellished on the various aspects of this character, the dynamics of his friendship with Kirk, that being distinct from the original series.  Simon Pegg brings a light hearted, but dynamic Scotty to the screen.  He provides some very funny moments  and in so doing affords the Scotty character more screen time.  Zoe Saldana's Uhura is slowly growing on me, after having grown up with the pioneering, mysterious, graceful  and exotic depiction of the original serie's Nichelle Nichols. Then again, like this cast, she is trying to bring her own approach to the role.",1388448000,2,2612,4.7234513274336285

I purchased this film primarily because I wanted a 3D blu ray holiday gift for my family, and because there wasn't much else that I could find. I just finished viewing the film, and I am still in shock about what I just witnessed. The intelligent, balanced, and ultimately thrilling script; the top-notch acting (Chris Pine in particular shines); and the realistic special effects are outstanding and the unqualified BEST of any Star Trek film to date. The film is not merely as engaging as any given Star Trek episode, but a great film period, and one of the best films I've seen in 2013. I am so happy that Star Trek finally got the big-screen treatment it has always deserved. What makes it all the more amazing to me is how the experience of watching it contrasted to my experience of seeing the Wrath of Khan in the theater and knowing even as a child that the latter movie wasn't terribly well done.

I personally love the new movies and think this is a definite 5 star flick for any science fiction lover.  Great action, solid storyline, and good characters.  While the ending was a little predictable for my taste, it was still well-down and entertaining.

Enjoy!",1388361600,,775,4.870229007633588

It helps that the cast they have for the new series are well chosen, and seen to have done their homework on the characters they play.

As always with the franchise, the effects are top shelf. The story telling fast paced. This is the third time we get a story about Khan, and it can stand up as a worthy addition to the series.

Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect villain.  His looks, his deep voice, his menace -- phenomenal.  The development of the relationship between Kirk and Spock is also a central theme of the movie as they both learn how to get along and how to become trusted friends, despite their shortcomings.  Now that J.J. Abrams is off to helm the Star Wars reboot, I'm worried that the third Star Trek could suffer.

Again it re-writes some of the original lore, but this was done in the first movie in this series and completely necessary to continue on, in my opinion. Once too much myth knowledge was reached, new stories of these beginnings would have been nearly impossible. The reset, left open a myriad of possibilities.  This film is a prime example of this. It allows a different outcome to a previous story while still telling a thrilling and true to character story. I do not and won't give anything away.

But if you want to know about this Blu-ray as a product...

I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because there are special features missing from this Blu-ray. Almost every retailer (Amazon, Walmart, Target, or Best Buy) place  different and separate bonus features on the disc. The audio commentary is missing and can only be heard if you buy it from iTunes.  There is no one disc that has them all and no average person would buy the same movie from each store.

Pros:

-Good acting. Actors play their respective parts well
-Fantastic action and set pieces throughout
-Brings to light several aspects of the Star Trek universe we've never seen before (new uniforms, locations)
-Is a good allegory story to modern day terrorism.

CONS:
-Music was sub par. I was expecting more after the awesomeness of the first one
-Why rehash an old star trek story. I would have preferred something new.
-A few plot holes.
-I would have like to see more of starfleet involved versus just the enterprise again the bad guys. . . .again

I have to say that I am a life long Trek fan, and I was able to realize that the timeline alterations of the last Trek film made an entirely fresh take on events. Things were altered and it invigorated our beloved franchise, in a solid fun and exciting new way. This is one (after the last film) to introduce new cadets to Starfleet values.

I found myself literally smacking my hand to my forehead and going ""What?!"" The special effects were good. Fine - that's what you expect from most action movies these days. And yes, I'm not a fan of a re-do of the beloved original crew (even though I think the selection for the guy who plays McCoy is pretty good.) I hate the Uhura-Spock relationship - it never happened in canon works, and it's just silly. Basically the new stuff is someone's idea of a remake of Star Trek. Just make a new movie series with new characters. Why are you screwing with a classic movie and sci-fi series? Because you can't think of anything new to do.

I only have watched these new Star Treks for free through trial offers. I won't pay for them on my own and I feel honestly, after Voyager, the franchise was done for me. I hated Enterprise, and the two new movies just don't fit. The new creators wouldn't listen to what fans want, and instead tried to re-create the series for a younger audience. Maybe they're making money, but eventually the fanbase won't be there and it will fizzle out. This is just another action-based sci-fi movie series...and nothing really special about it.

5291490,4,B009934S5M,"This is the second movie in the new Star Trek franchise featuring a great Chris Pine as a young James T. Kirk and Zachery Qunito as a young Spock.  I had originally thought the new actors playing Bones, Scotty, and the Russian helmsman (sorry the character's name escapes me at the moment) were miscast.  However, I feel that they've grown into their roles more, or else I've grown to love them more in those roles.  The plot is a new rendition of the original Khan story.  For those who are unfamiliar with the original plot, the new one will seem unique and interesting.  Those who are familiar with the original plot may have some problem with the new version of Khan.  However, I didn't have a problem accepting the new version.  I happen to love Benedict Cumberbatch and liked the new twists on Khan.  I especially  like seeing a younger James Kirk learning to accept authority and how to be the great leader he ends up being.  There is also the developing brotherhood and friendship between Spock and Kirk, though rocky because of Spock's race and struggle to be truthful and analytical in all things.  It isn't easy for a Vulcan to live and work among emotional and sometimes irrational humans!  However, brotherhood and friendship does win in the end. The visuals are stunning.  The 3D effects well placed.  The only complaint I have in this movie is the production's decision to split the special features between the various sources for the DVD.  The ones on the DVD I purchased from Amazon are not available through Best Buy, or any other resource.  Which means you either don't get all the special features, or have to buy multiple versions of the DVD in order to see them all.  Come on, who would do that?

5291498,3,B009934S5M,"<Spoiler Alert - Plot elements will be discussed> Let me be forthright and admit upfront that I do not like the new Star Trek movies. That applies to many other movies being issued by Hollywood these days as well. The reason is they sacrifice story for special effects and a barrage of sound. No doubt this is what many look for, and walk out of a theater thinking they saw a good movie when in fact they simply saw a lot of visual and auditory stimuli. I further detest that Hollywood will rewrite the legends of the characters and back story. I think of these newer Star Trek movies as a ""parallel universe"" where Star Trek lore and legend evolved differently. Traditionalists may look elsewhere, because the story we grew up with is not here. The new actors do a remarkable job of imitating the old characters, and even look like them too. The one exception is the character of Captain Kirk. The old Kirk had a human element where he would ""roll the dice"" upon occasion or play a hunch, much to Spock's chagrin. This has been overplayed in the new Kirk to the point where he is an immature, undisciplined, and loose cannon danger to all around him. This Kirk should never have been admitted to Star Fleet Academy. The story in this sequel is a remake of a remake. SPOILER: Our old nemesis Khan is back, although it is no longer Ricardo Montalban, nor do the other genetically altered supermen of the Botany Bay appear. Suffice to say, the framework is there for sufficient amounts of visual and auditory mayhem to ensue as the good guys try to defeat two bad guys, Khan and the evil admiral who revived him from cryogenic sleep. I find it a curious twist that the new Trek movies have tried so hard to be different from the old Trek universe to the point of changing the legend outright, and yet they have fallen back on one of the Enterprise's greatest (old) legendary enemies to create the cinematic motivation for this movie. Fascinating. Old legend lovers can miss this movie, special effects lovers will be well satisfied.",1388016000,6,2030,4.564383561643836

5291500,4,B009934S5M,"The newest Star Trek is not very true to the spirit of the original series, but it takes the foundation and gives a fresh spin. So long as you know and anticipate that this is a different interpretation of the material, you will probably enjoy the movie. If you are looking for a remake that embodies the allegorical/metaphorical nature that was often found in the Star Trek series, you will be disappointed. Though the new Star Trek movies are lighter on substance, they make up for it with enjoyable action, fun characters, and very cool sci-fi effects. JJ Abrams seems to divide people, but I tend to enjoy his way of storytelling - it makes for great popcorn flicks.

As a sci-fi nerd, I can appreciate the reasons purists do not enjoy this film. The allegorical fables that made Star Trek such a riveting series is almost completely absent from the reboots. I do, however, love to see a fun sci-fi movie. I can enjoy these as stand-alone stories that pay homage to the original, although they don't capture the original ""heart"" contained in the source material.  I wouldn't say the acting is phenomenal, but they capture a fun aura of the original characters which makes the dialogue, even when it is silly, fun to watch.

If you can separate the need for a pure remake from just watching a fun sci-fi/action movie, you will probably enjoy this film.",1387929600,3,1355,4.661087866108787
5291501,3,B009934S5M,"Oh brother....where to begin.  Okay, here: dumb.  I think that describes the movie as a whole.  Don't get me wrong, I like the Star Trek franchise, but this one ""misses it"" all together.  I rate the move more than 2 stars only because it has action and special effects that some enjoy.

*****Spoiler Alert*****

The script is bad for several reasons, namely the language.  Okay, I get it - we need to infuse some bad words here and there to get people to the movies, but give me break.  The whole Star Trek persona, if you will, is built on suppressing emotions in effort to solve stressful problems.  Remember the movie Star Trek 4?  Jim began using curse words here and there and it was funny because it was ironic yet fashionable to some extent in dealing with people from the late 20th century.

And Dr. Carol Marcus has an English accent?  Her father doesn't...how did she develop one?  And how does she lose it later on (see Star Trek 2)?

I don't know....it was like the directors and producers of this movie threw something together real quick.  I mean...come on....Spock yelling ""Kaaahhhhhnnnnn"" as Jim dies reminiscent (or foreshadowing I suppose) of Jim yelling ""Kahhhnnnnnn"" in Star Trek 2....oh brother.

I really shouldn't give it 3 stars.",1387929600,4,1253,4.7050691244239635

5291521,2,B009934S5M,"I thought ""Into Darkness"" was a great enough movie, not as good as the first one, but still fun to watch.  My low review is because of two things: the quality of Blu-ray and the special features content.  I'm really into commentaries with movies and this version doesn't have the director's commentary, which is ridiculous. I can get any crap movie out of the 5 dollar bin in any store and get directors commentary on it.  So shame on Paramount for splitting up the special features onto several different releases.  Second, the Bluray quality of this movie isn't blu-ray, its not any better than a regular DVD. (Yes I used my HDMI cord and yes, I put the bluray disc in my bluray player). I own several movies in blu-ray, like MIB3. MIB3 blu-ray quality is so crystal clear I actually only watched it once and gave it away and bought the regular DVD of the movie, because I didn't need to see that much of everyone's skin, it was kind of gross and really distracting. So because of all the action in ""Into Darkness"" I was excited to see all those special effects in blu-ray, but it wasn't anything special. Might as well buy the cheaper regular version of the movie and only if you don't watch special features.

5291535,5,B009934S5M,"I was rather disappointed with the first of the ""new"" Star Trek films starring this new cast and alternate Universe. The first film didn't make a whole lot of sense to me, as Spock would say, ""Highly Illogical"".

This second film fared much better with me. For one thing, it kept me guessing through more than half the film who was the real bad guy. Obviously, it was Kahn, but the way he pulled off his treachery was cleverly done. It reminded me of the original TOS character. He had a charm and charisma that got some members of the Enterprise crew to follow him. Of course he was a bad guy, but he wasn't originally all that scary. It wasn't until the ""Wrath of Kahn"" years later that we saw the really scary, dark and vicious side of him. Ricardo Montalban did a great job with him. In this film, Benedict Cumberbatch does a nice ""alternate"" Khan.

Without giving away spoilers, he is sometimes brutally cruel, sometimes seems the innocent victim of forces beyond his control, and sometimes is the kind of fighter you want on your side because he could take down a star ship all on his own, except you can't trust him. So you better call his bluff before he blows you into space. That's a complex villain, and he was obviously well crafted based on the prior characterizations. And lest he take you in with his charms, Capt'n Kirk will set you straight with a simple sentence, ""I have a feeling he's not helping us, we're helping him."" Brilliant!

I also kind of like the new all blue and white interiors of the Enterprise. Yes, it still does look like the make up counter in a hi tech department store, or something APPLE might design, but for some reason, this time around, I warmed up to it.

Of course, there's plenty of action in this film, the usual spaceships being severely damaged and people getting tossed out into space, complete with screams. And there's also the expected mass destruction of buildings, people and property when a star ship crashes into a planet (I won't spoil it by saying which star ship or which planet). And of course, there are the usual ""falling from great heights at ridiculous speeds and landing on target anyway"" sequences that are a common to these types of films. These types of scenes have become a staple or signature for this version of the genre.

What got me, and had a lasting effect, was how well the actors did with the characters. They did what every Star Trek version has managed to do... they created characters who I care about, who are fun to watch. This was one of the things that made Star Trek TOS so memorable... the characters seemed real because the actors made them so. Other series and spin offs were successful in this, and I'm happy to say, this new ""crew"" pulled together nicely in this film, making the characters likeable, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, and well, believable. Bravo to everyone on the bridge and in the engineering section, which still looks like the inside of a brewery.

So I give this film a 5 star thumbs up this time around. It's a fun romp, with plenty of nail biting suspense, and spinning scenes to give you vertigo. And, perhaps the best compliment I can give the film, I am eager to see what they come up with in the next film.

5291541,4,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a very exciting revamp of the Star Trek films, and a worthy sequel to the 2009 Star Trek.  Great pains were taken to match the current actors' likenesses to the previous actors' likenesses -- with the exception of Khan, of course, but more about that in a moment.

What I loved about the film is the finely tuned character web.  All of the characters of the Star Trek series are well known, which leaves the dilemma of how to successfully give each of them enough onscreen time to develop their characters.  In Into Darkness, all of the crew members' roles were not only essential but virtually interchangeable.  They moved from task to task, position to position seamlessly, setting up the theme that the crew members are as family.

I felt that the way the women were portrayed in the film could have been worked on a lot more.  Uhura and Carol had their share of onscreen time, but they did not really cause much action to occur.  I was also disappointed, still, by the heiny-hugging mini dresses and the gratuitous bra-n'-panty flashes that are a rote part of today's action films.  I mean, this is set in the 24th century.  Get with it!

I also loved the big sets and fast-paced action scenes.  As a woman, I sometimes feel uninspired with respect to how the concept of war is approached in film.  Into Darkness however left me chewing my fingernails to the stubs, particularly during the confrontation between Kirk and his unconscious ""id"", Admiral Marcus.  Marcus was the top-tier villain over Kahn, having been constructed out of Kirk's very conscious need for domination and control.

Which brings me to what I felt was one of the more glaring flaws in this film.  I felt that Kirk was a product of what I'll refer to as ""Life in the Bubble.""  He only sees things his way and mostly expects everyone else to see things his way as well.  Kirk seems to barrel forward fueled by his own impetus and self-interest -- clearly not qualities befitting a Star Fleet captain.  This makes it difficult to identify with Kirk.  He is getting away with murder... and being rewarded for it.  The only redeeming element is when Kirk's senior officer, Admiral Pike, chews him out over lying to his superiors and delivers the bad news that command of the Enterprise has been taken away from him.

I felt it difficult to feel a sense of loss over Kirk, even in light of the sacrifice he made for his crew, largely because in the film he is dictating that loss to the audience by delivering his own eulogy -- a task that should have been left to Mr. Spock, who was actually experiencing the loss of his friend.

There is another disturbing theme in this film, that of the de-evolution of mankind being viewed as the future of mankind.  This theme is set up in the 2009 Star Trek when Vulcan -- a planet of inhabitants who believe they have evolved beyond the outward emotional trappings of, say, Earthlings -- is destroyed.  Why would the writers/directors of this long-running series go to such lengths to design as unique a character as Mr. Spock only to sacrifice him to the Cro-Magnon mentality of today's action flicks?  Why must he, too, become a fist-pounding brute in order to justify the paradigm of savagery and war outlined by the Enterprise's prisoner, Khan?

Which brings me to Khan.  For all of those who chose to focus on the ethnicity of the actor who portrayed Khan, you'll probably want to leave now.  I too was left momentarily confused at the depiction of a light-complected, blue-eyed, supposedly Asian man in the role of Khan, but the actor's portrayal of the villain rose above all of the other characters in the film -- and above all of the negative banter.
Khan's initial actions seem heartless and blood thirsty... until he has the opportunity to speak.  This Khan embodied the often imposed-upon identity of being the ""other man,"" the one who is ""not one of us,"" the one who ""doesn't belong.""

Khan, from his recitation, is awoken from a three-hundred-year cryogenic sleep at the command of Admiral Marcus -- the most senior officer of all of Star Fleet.  The rest of Khan's crew mates languish in stasis.  Khan reveals that he is of a race of genetically-engineered beings purposed with restoring peace at a time of war.  Khan is enrolled by Admiral Marcus in the belief that all civilized life is under threat of extermination by ""the enemy,"" the Klingons, and that if he does not assist him in building warships and weapons, he and his crew will perish as well.

As Khan realizes that Admiral Marcus' intentions are focused more upon his own self-aggrandizement and less on the protection of the universe, he attempts to defect.  Admiral Marcus threatens the lives of Khan's crew, and Khan is forced to secrete his few remaining crew mates' cryogenic containers within the fuselage compartments of the long-range torpedoes he helped design.

This revelation of events and the subsequent act of desperation is delivered with such emotional depth that it nearly becomes impossible to realign the audience with concern over the plight of the Enterprise and its crew.  Even a cameo by the original Spock, the venerable Leonard Nimoy, cannot help.  The antagonist arguably becomes the hero, in light of the avalanche of disreputable deeds committed by the Star Fleet envoy, and the audience is left wanting to see more of this character.

Even Khan's final act of vengeance, where he instructs the disabled dreadnought Vengeance to crash land on Star Fleet headquarters, thereby killing as many of the little devils as possible, evoked a round of sinister giggles from me, as Kirk, and Star Fleet's, integrity (through Admiral Marcus), was damaged at that point beyond repair.

Although the final battle scene between Khan and Spock is extremely exciting, as well as relevant in ending the threat imposed by Khan, and although by and large the performance by all of the characters in the film is superb, I just felt little sense of triumph, let alone closure.

At the end of Star Trek Into Darkness, Kirk, after having been revived from the dead via a transfusion of Khan's stolen ""super"" blood, delivers the final epilog, making the story appear to be all neatly tied up at the end.  But not quite.  Not quite.",1387670400,2,6253,4.739371534195933

However, if you HAVE seen Star Trek, you'll probably be compelled to wonder why these people are called Kirk and Spock, and why is this villain called Khan?  The characters barely hold even a passing resemblance to the original, so why name them as such?  I suppose this follows a trend in recent films of using familiar characters in totally unsuitable ways; Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes in films that have nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes is one example.  All that said, it's a fun film.  But is it Star Trek?  Not really.  Someone described it as ""alternative history fan-fiction.""  I think that's accurate.",1387497600,5,791,4.7153284671532845

5291571,2,B009934S5M,"I kept hoping for a good movie but had confidence in JJ Abrams not to really produce one. My confidence was rewarded. He screws up everything he touches--Lost, Alias, Revolution. Create concept, start strong, crash and burn.

Recently I watched this movie on Netflix, then all of Enterprise (had never seen it until this year) and went back to rewatch TOS episodes. I've come out of it convinced ST belongs on the small screen. It needs episodic treatment to bring the vision to life. The movies only really work if they follow a series.

The first JJ movie was pretty good despite JJ being part of it. It wasn't Star Trek but it bore a slight resemblance to it and was watchable. This one was like a cheesy B movie, right down to the horrible airline captain dress uniforms they had that made those awful TOS dress uniforms look stylish by comparison (ok the movie's regular uniforms are bad too as is the bridge of the Enterprise but those I can live with). I found myself laughing out loud at lots of the scenes, corny acting that make Shatner look like a titan of the silver screen. Pine can't hold a candle to Shatner, frankly. I  couldn't wait for it to end.

These movies apparently sell well but they aren't creating a dedicated fanbase from what I can see as they have no vision of a better future. They're popcorn. Filling but no substance. They're space operas which are fine but they're not Star Trek. They more resemble Star Wars without the thought behind the crafting of that universe. The next one I have read is to have a smaller budget as this didn't do as well as they'd hoped despite the money it raked in.

But maybe the movies will create the impetus for a new TV series where a reimagined Star Trek can finally be brought to life (with JJ as far from it as possible). The movies are not reimagined as they lack imagination, this one most of all.

Having seen him in BBC's Sherlock, I can only say I'm glad he's become a familiar face to US audiences through the internet and through movies such as these. Besides Khan, all of the crew of the Enterprise are so in character and so familiar that I can't help but totally enjoy this movie - brash Kirk, logical yet humane Spock, Bones.

The movie depends to much of Computer Generated scenes to Confiscate for its weak plot line and predicable storyline. What I find most irritating about this movie is that it tries to be different but the same as the original Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan.  JJ Abrams is an overall good, yet basic,  TV Series producer but a horrible movie director.  There is nothing original or new about this movie.  It is just a rehash of what has been done before, just with better graphics.  I don't understand why people think this was a good movie.",1387411200,6,646,4.378151260504202
5291582,2,B009934S5M,"If you have seen the film imagine for a moment if Khan had been erased entirely from the film and Benedict Cumberbatch played as John Harrison a double-agent looking to start a war with the Klingons.

What you would have had is a film that more focused on a struggle for the very soul of Star Fleet - would it be one military might and pre-emptive strikes or would it be one of peace and exploration? The struggle was there in the film but unfortunately too much was focused on Khan that it became buried and practically a subplot to the film.

The only thing this Khan had going for him was name recognition. Seriously if you had no frame of reference, his character is so pointless to the story - a 300 year old genetically modified guy woken up to work on weapon systems centuries ahead of his time and he wants revenge because he thinks his super buddies have been killed. Uh, ok?

And Khan's grand revenge scheme is to create a situation where the top officials of Star Fleet would gather and then just shoot the hell out of the place outside a window. This guy's suppose to be a genius? He didn't even kill the one guy he really wanted. Another one of those ring bombs he designed would have been more effective. When Kirk interrupts his turkey shoot, he teleports all the way to the Klingon homeworld and does nothing but hang out wearing a cloak until the Enterprise crew shows up later. What was his plan exactly if the Enterprise hadn't shown up conveniently carrying his people in torpedoes? He just so didn't need to be in this movie.

The attempt to militarize Star Fleet and jump start a war with the Klingons was a more interesting story and should have been developed further. Given the changes in the reboot universe with Vulcan having been destroyed this would have caused a major shift in the power politics of the galaxy making some in Star Fleet justifiably nervous of Klingon and Romulan reactions. You could have had a struggle in the film where both sides make a good case for themselves but ultimately the more difficult route of peace is the one settled on.

Anyway that hypothetical movie aside, I have trouble buying this new reboot as Star Trek. We have a captain who was promoted from cadet to star ship captain and he is given charge of the flagship of Star Fleet? There weren't any other officers out there with years of experience to take that job? All the older series and movies made Star Fleet more organized where people advanced through the ranks based on merit and more importantly experience. Most of the star ship captains we saw through out the other shows and movies were seasoned veterans. Even in the old series Kirk was in his thirties and had several years under his belt as lower-ranking officers. This Kirk just stands out as a wet behind the ears captain who would have been put in his place by every other star ship captain from the old series.

Another problem with the film is that it seems to be written with little thought to the consequences. The writers just wrote a bunch of stuff to either make for a cool action scene or magically resolve away a problem like Kirk's death (Spock had to have his body shot onto a miracle planet and his mind melded with another person to come back to life which took an entire movie) but gave no thought to the potential consequences. One or two are forgivable but they made so many that would have completely changed or destroyed the Star Trek world.

Khan uses a portable transwarp teleporter which transports him from earth to the klingon homeworld countless lightyears away. That device alone would have changed everything in the Star Trek universe. Klingons and Romulans would be scrambling to the designs of that and beaming their warriors all over the galaxy to conqueror.

At the beginning of the film, the Enterprise crew use a cold fusion device to make a volcano inert. You could teleport those suckers into planet cores and destroy them. Coupled with the transwarp teleporter you could do it all from the comfort of your home and hold the whole galaxy ransom.

The Enterprise crew wipes out a patrol of Klingons on their home planet. Wouldn't the Klingons have looked into that? Couldn't that have started a major incident? In Star Trek IV the Klingons were angry because a rogue Kirk killed a Klingon crew and took their ship even though that ship had destroyed a Federation ship earlier. You'd think a patrol wiped out on their home planet no less would create a major stink but no the scene was just to have some lazer fights and some Khan moments to establish he's tough.

There was a whole secret base near Jupiter which built the huge war ship. This implies a major conspiracy and effort to build it and maintain its secrecy. At the end of the movie apparently it was just one guy and some dudes he hired.

A huge starship crashes into San Francisco which would have killed thousands of people but the people who witness it just go about their business once it's over as Khan and Spock race through them.

And of course there is Khan's superblood which can cure diseases like the little girl at the beginning and bring Kirk back from the dead after massive radiation poisoning. his blood would cause a major change in the galaxy. Klingons and Romulans would love to have access to blood that could keep their soldiers going. There'd be huge wars over control of those super people and their blood.

Again a lot of this is due to Khan being shoehorned into the movie solely for name recognition purposes.

If you want a sci-fi action movie with a lot of action scenes loosely tied together where stuff just happens, then this is the film for you; however do not try to give much thought to the plot because it unravels fairly quickly into a convoluted mess.",1387324800,9,5766,4.558454106280193

5291588,3,B009934S5M,"OK, it's hard to seriously argue that any other Star Trek movie comes close to Wrath of Khan. (Voyage Home, Undiscovered Country and First Contact are each good in their own ways, though.) And yes, it's getting pretty long in the tooth. But why was a remake/alternative timeline version of it, the sequel to the film that was supposed to be rebooting the franchise? Let's see something new, not a sometimes shot-for-shot response to a 30-year-old film. The folks who don't know the original get a somewhat odd post-9/11 Star Trek movie and the people who do know the original get a puzzling, sometimes pointlessly reverential response to an earlier, better film.

Now, let it not be said that this isn't better-acted, with better special effects and better dialogue. Divorcing the plot and concept from the movie itself, it has the makings of a better movie than Wrath of Khan. But had that acting, special effects and dialogue been turned toward telling an actual new story -- maybe the five-year mission teased at the end of this film -- we could have gotten a movie that could stand shoulder to shoulder with Wrath of Khan, instead of just standing in its long shadow.",1387324800,2,1171,4.768472906403941

5291593,2,B009934S5M,"I am a big fan of the original Star Trek and to a lesser extent the later series and some of the movies such as the one Nimoy directed.  Star Trek Next Generation was generally weak but had a few very good, very well written science fiction episodes. Don't have much good to say about Enterprise or Deep Space Nine.  J. J. Abrams' 2009 Star Trek reboot was quite good, respectful of the origin myth while adding to it, introducing characters we all know in a very fresh way, etc.  In short it was very well written and directed.  I'm also a fan of J. J. Abrams work in general, as it's often of relatively high quality.

In this context, Star Trek Into Darkness has very little to recommend it, and the writing is very weak.  The plotting is weak.  Most characters are shallow and lazily written.  The flow drags often.  Probably the best aspect is Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain, since he can probably make even poor lines and weak scripts sound good through superb delivery.

5291596,5,B009934S5M,I ordered all those movies and more. I choose Amazon because it is the best p lace to order movies and books. You get what you pay for. Why go anyplace else.  N. Ploeger,1387238400,,169,3.9705882352941178

I do think overall this movie is about as good as I've seen (without the original cast of course:)  The producers seemed to have done an excellent job of matching new actors to the former classic's. I would recommend this movie to anyone but if are a die hard Trekie like myself  its a must have and I'm sure this will become known as another Star Trek Classic high point.,1387152000,,469,4.142857142857143

The only problem I had, and I'm showing my age here, is the deviation from the original series. I presume the current spate of movies are designed to be ""prequels"". In the original series captain Pike is severely disabled and cannot function without a specialized device. An episode, (or was it 2?), was devoted to Mr. Spock's mutiny trail for taking control of the enterprise in order to get captain Pike to a planet, whose name escapes me, where he could live the remainder of his years ""normally"".",1387152000,,627,4.607142857142857

Just not as entertaining as the first in this series.  Hope the next one does better.",1387065600,3,413,5.134328358208955
5291623,4,B009934S5M,"I've been a Trek fan since I was a kid (I grew up watching TNG and reruns of TOS) and enjoyed the first ""reboot"" movie. It had its problems (mainly in the plot and certain directing choices) but was fun to watch and captured the feel of the classic characters.

Into Darkness continues this trend, maturing Kirk into a true leader who measures the consequences of his actions, and strengthening the bond between him and Spock (as well as allowing more screen time for McCoy, Uhura, etc). I was worried when I heard about the villain, but he was written in very nicely (Cumberbatch may not look like the original actor who played the role, but does a similarly awesome job conveying his power) and most of the nods to both the 2009 movie and the original series and its movies were welcome (though some were copied too directly). I found the bulk of the movie to be entertaining and exciting, which to me counts for a lot. I do hope that the next movie shifts the story away from Earth and takes us on a more unique adventure (and please drop the ""gigantic, dark, scary-looking enemy ship"" as that has been done to death already!).

By the way, this may be the best-looking Blu-Ray transfer I've ever seen. It looks perfect from start to finish, even in the space scenes (no digital noise!) and when things blow up and debris is flying everywhere. I do agree that more special features would have been nice (maybe Abrams will record a commentary later on?), and that the menus could have been done like the 2009 movie (here they are more generic), but the movie does stand by itself.",1387065600,2,1582,4.508710801393728

5291629,2,B009934S5M,"I personally love star trek, in particular the 90s era with The Next Generation and DS9, and its great to see Trek movies still making it big. However, though visually quite awesome these films don't really delve into the ""trek"" ideals of the 90s: making a better world where the focus is on exploration and discovery as opposed to wealth acquisition, non-interference with less sophisticated cultures, complex but still emotionally compelling moral issues, and dealing with new and exciting species and phenomena.

This film is straight up awesome action, but frankly I can get that from many other films. I'm not sure if a more thoughtful Star Trek film could make it in theaters right now, or if TV is the only medium in which that form of trek can exist, but I'd love to see a trek film which is not only visually gorgeous and exciting, but which really inspires a bit more awe and ""wow, cool, never thought of that before"" or even ""gee, the world CAN be a better place.""",1387065600,3,975,4.635838150289017

Too many climaxes, too much predictability, far too many gaping plot holes, some of the worst script writing I can recall (and I've been watching zombie movies lately, which now look far better in comparison). I can't believe this thing is so highly rated. All the special effects seemed attempts to mask the lack of a coherent plot or lines worth acting for. Even Cumberbatch couldn't save this one.

While I'm no trekkie, I at least appreciated Star Trek for asking interesting questions and being character driven. There were no interesting questions here and it was primarily character drivel. I can't understand why I didn't turn this thing off 15 minutes into it, in hindsight it was so clear where this was going. A pastiche of former star trek memes, vigorous nods to Star Wars, Blade Runner and plenty of other SF films far better than this one.

Also, given this new timeline, reusing old ideas of TOS, is like retouching a painting: low creativity.

The big action sequnces were pretty great, and was heading to one of the best action films I've seen in a while.  Then the story was just all over the place, totally hard to buy nearly everything they were selling.  Story was hard to understand.  Which side do we trust here everybody's crooked.  Totally sappy at the end.  Started out a great movie with intrigue and just hit a wall half way thru.  It was becoming Pierce Brosnan's James Bond level rediculous.  Too bad, just when I was starting to think Star Trek was gaining on the Star Wars series, silly me. It was worth it for .99, but I wouldn't pay more than $2 for this film.",1386806400,2,936,4.447058823529412

As far as the movie - I really waited a while to watch the first of the new Star Trek movie series because I just could not see having different people playing my favorite characters, but they delighted me with the way they portrayed each character so well, and still had the freedom to add a new dimension to their changed reality and roles.

I have heard a few detractors who comment on the new Spock being sub-par (and gripe about the teen-y cast...as if), but I completely disagree. I am on the side of people who say this is a flawless mainstream type film, that plays it very safe on all sides with rich dialogue, ample acting, top-of-the-line visual effects, a nearly excessive amount of action (just shy of Matrix 2 level) that is fairly believable (all things considering). I only hold back on five stars because I can't say it was one of my favorite movies. It's the kind of movie you watch on a large screen with big sound, and then mostly forget about later.

The only thing that I dislike about the first two films of this new generation is the shaky cam. I can deal with lens glare, as that gives the film a more realistic ""like you're there"" look, but this 2nd film (Into Darkness) just seemed to have more shaky camera footage than the first. It has GOT to stop. I have a 46-inch HDTV and sit about 12 feet away, so it is manageable, but for someone who sits closer or has a larger screen, I feel for ya.

""Into Darkness"" is appropriately named. There are a lot of dark themes throughout, villains where you wouldn't expect, and a lot more focus on Spock than Kirk it seems. That's okay with me. Extras were thin but enough to satisfy my taste for behind the scenes. The digital copy looks great on my computer. I haven't touched the DVD, only the blu-ray.",1386460800,2,1065,4.428571428571429

5291726,3,B009934S5M,"...and most fans probably imagined it already: the Star Trek films usually alternate between good and bad, thus since Star Trek X turned out quite good, the next one couldn't be but a disappointment.

In the first place, I can't understand why it had to be 3D filming. The movie is already packed full of action, hypnotizing music, heart-wrenching drama, images flitting so quickly by that you can hardly discern them properly: but I guess it had to be in 3D because today's moviegoers, spoilt as they are, might otherwise get horribly bored.
The pictures are almost always stunning, as is the music. I liked the portrayal of the villain, his motives were more believable than in Star Trek II; and a few scenes were really moving, like Pike's death. But it more or less ends there.
To enlist all that I found disputable:

1. The opening scene - these funny aliens looked more ridiculous than any whose sight we had to endure during the original series. Having so much more budget today, is that all the filmmakers can come up with?
2. Spock's ""pose"" in the volcano when he briefly thought he would have to die - my god, how pathetic.
3. Harrisons attack on the Starfleet elite: Kirk screams to the others ""Down!"" but doesn't duck or jump to the side himself (?) Later he manages to damage Harrison's helicopter, but when it flies exactly in his direction and crashes into the wall right near him, he just stands rooted to the ground. Is the man suicidal? (Knowing the movie's end: he probably is. But then, why is such a disturbed man allowed to captain a ship with over 400 crew members?!)
4. Later, Kirk tells Spock he will miss him. Miss the man who cost him his captaincy?
5. Spock and Uhura, two - as is well known - discreet, reasonable and practical persons must carry out their emotional quarrel while they are on the way to a dangerous mission and while their captain is present? And why doesn't he tell them to be quiet and keep such conversations for later?
6. Spock' behaviour towards Uhura is cool bordering on uncaring; on the other hand he begins to develop strong feelings for Kirk. There is absolutely no explanation for this.
7. Kirk beats Harrison at least 10 times before his comrades utter the first word of protest. Excuse me, what happened to morals?
8. Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent actor, but he doesn't bear the smallest similarity to Ricardo Montalban. Why couldn't he simply be some other villain, why in the world did it have to be Khan?
9. Dear me, Kirk's and Khan's endless flight from one space ship to the other. Doesn't the director know when it's time to yell ""Cut!""?
10. After their helmets were already about to burst, Kirk and Khan tumble into the foreign starship full tilt, skidding and rolling over several times. Of course, none of them loses an eye through split glass or is otherwise hurt.
11. At the end of the movie - of course - Kirk can be reanimated. How could he not be brain dead yet after all of that time?! I will move to the 23rd century now, it seems they can even resuscitate people there...
12. Action, action and more action. What I liked in particular about Star Trek were the intelligent dialogues, the relationships of the characters and the philosophical, sometimes harassing social questions it dealt with. What has become of all that?
13. Character design: it has hardly anything left to do with the characters thought up by Roddenberry. Uhura is a ""contemporary"", emancipated woman, and additionally she can't hold a candle to Nichelle Nichols' beauty. Kirk has almost no kindness to show, only heaps of arrogance. Spock is by far too emotional - I will concede that he is traumatized through the loss of his home world, but nevertheless, is that necessary? Scott is markedly jovial, since when was he supposed to be the story's clown? Apart from that, the actor looks by far too small and thin for the role.
14. During the original series and the films the characters hardly had a chance to develop. Here they have the chance, being still very young. And what happens? They used to repeat the same mistakes, here they can develop - and then they repeat the same mistakes anyway.
15. At last, Carol Marcus has her big performance. Only this reduces the film to the usual Hollywood pattern - hero wins over the villain, saves the world and the beautiful (blonde) maiden. Argh.

As for the film's moral, I prefer not to start or the patriots will try to kill me online right away. Kirks speech at the end of the movie, stating that ""we are not the kind of people who seek revenge""... oh, well. I will leave this to the viewer's own opinion.",1386460800,3,4610,4.59902794653706

5291736,4,B009934S5M,"I know in some circles there is hate on about this movie,. but I truly enjoyed it.

They managed to keep a lot of what made the last movie in the franchise work, which isn't always a sure thing when talking about a sequel (which even though this is movie 11 in the franchise this essentially is).  The interpersonal relationships that made the last one enjoyable really carry through to this movie.  It has the same sense of humor and pokes fun of itself just like the the last movie.

Even though I am a huge fan of ""The Wrath of Khan"", the essential revisiting of that story, didn't bug me so much.  This is a new universe and part of the fun of that is revisiting some of the great moments with a new spin.  Cumberbatch was excellent as Khan.  His nearly dead gaze at most situation was very well done and he managed to pull off a good balance between menacing and psychopath.

My only real complaint was near the end.  They managed to spin the Khan story well enough up to this point to make the story feel unique, and then they went and hit the major notes from Star Trek II with very little revision.  I get what Abrams was trying to do, but it just didn't work for me.  It felt to gimmicky.

That being said, I still really enjoyed watching this movie.",1386288000,,1259,4.243697478991597

5291744,1,B009934S5M,"If you loved star trek, how Kirk is a good person, how the colors in the future are bright, or how Spock is a disciplined mind, or the beautiful image of a hopeful future, then this movie is NOT for you. The true fan can very easily see that this movie was not made by a Trekkie, but by someone who disliked the whole Roddenberry vision. The makers of this film thought that their meaningless regurgitation of generic Hollywood plot and dialogue was better than the sensitive and inspiring world of a true science fiction writer. The plot makes no sense. No continuity editing whatsoever.

Kirk's eyes are fake contact blue in some scenes, just to be brownish in the next. In this movie they no longer show Kirk as an intelligent Captain who refers to Shakespeare and thinks deeply upon interpersonal meanings. This movie represents Kirk as an alcoholic man-slut who sleeps with two women at a time and listens to club/rap music. I guess the whole Kirk being a likable person is not as profitable as just showing the kids the new horrible role model that sells units in Hollywood today. Who cares that they're ruining yet another positive image? This is NOT Kirk. They missed the point of all the characters we've been developing for fifty years.

Would anybody but a soulless Hollywood businessman imagine Scotty hanging out at the bar they show him in? Scotty is a likable old nerd who likes scotch and the hum of his engines, not hanging out in a thumping club for fashionable young people. No fan ever would have imagined this really stupid scene.

Furthermore, in all the rest of Star Trek, whenever they show the Earth it is a calm and natural environment. We used to get the feeling that the future was something positive and better than today. This film shows a dark depressing Orwellian future, an all gray world of clubs, meaningless sex, and more bad music. The future of Earth in this vision is just a dark continuation of today's lowbrow shallow society. It is apparent that the makers of this film are either ignorant of Roddenberry's positive vision or that they are directly attacking it on purpose.

They blatantly ignored the point of looking up towards a brighter future and instead made an allegory of today's stupid warlike culture here in a America. Interestingly the costumes are low quality, and by the end they are all literally lined up in what can only be described as Nazi uniforms. Oh, they took the time to remove the WWII symbols but that's about it. Nazi uniforms - hat and all.

Also, there's the whole tribble problem. I'm not going to get into it too deeply, but let it be said that they include the tribble so we can do scientific testing on it! Great right?!? No. What they are really doing here is telling all actual fans that they have not watched and do not care about the previous fifty years of Trek mythos. Question: How can you have these creatures before your 5 year mission. Answer: Because we don't care about making sense. There are many more stupid examples of plot points that make no sense.

Long story short: THIS IS NOT STAR TREK. It just looks like it occasionally and they use the say names. If you love Trek, skip this. You'll be glad you did. Worst movie yet.

Maybe we need to admit it's better to let something end with the passing of the originators, than it is to just hand it off to next shallower generation of careless Hollywood businessmen.",1386201600,39,3405,4.599670510708402

5291756,2,B009934S5M,"J.J. Abrams is style over substance. We all know about his comical use of lens flares, but it's the story where he's fundamentally weak. No obvious affinity for any flavor of Star Trek, and his work is pretty to the detriment of story. And the poor decision to mask Cumberbatch's character's name -- just lame. And when they got to the magic blood potion, I almost turned it off right then. Did Bones get help from a witch with a cauldron? Incredibly lame.

I feel sorry for the Star Wars fans. Abrams doesn't have the slightest understanding of science, and so his scripts are full of deus ex machina gimmicks. Gee -- let's just throw in transporting between planets because we don't want to spend time getting there (that time). Then why is the whole movie about a starship? Let's kill the lead and resurrect him with a magic blood potion -- is Kirk a vampire in the next movie? On and on, he just doesn't have any understanding or affinity for basic science, physics, or common sense. Throw in another lens flare, or 50! How about lens flares on lens flares on lens flares -- take it to the limit. Really creative.

I guess if I didn't grow up watching ToS, TNG, Ds9 and Enterprise; I'd LOVE it.  Granted it is an alternate timeline, per the first movie's script/plot, but still it lacks that certain something that hints to Roddenbury's original ideas.

Decent, popcorn action-flick. Star Trek, but barely so IMO.

There's even more fan service in the details than in Abrams' first adventure - including at least one nod to the ill-received Enterprise TV show. There's action at the expense of story and yet there's still a lot of character development for such an ensemble. A shame they'll never be as tight as Shatner's without weekly appearances.

The way that Khan defeats the Klingons single-handedly is ridiculous, for example.  By the end, we were both glad it was over.  While a good chase scene or battle scene can work well in a movie, here they're just an excuse for the special effects.  The real film basically stops when they send Kirk after Khan--after that, we get a few scattered details about characters and background, but no real character or plot development.

The love connection twist between Spock and Ohura was questionable in my view since previous series/episodes suggested there may have been such a connection between Kirk and Ohura (oh well I guess the 5-year Voyage was boring at times).  Anyway, I recommend that you go back and view the original ""Wrath of Khan"" just to have the background info.  When you do this you will see the almost ""exact same scene"" in the nuclear reactor.  In the ""Wrath of Khan"", Spock dies of radiation burns.  In the new version, Kirk is the one who dies.  I don't know why the writers did this.  I think it was in poor taste and made me feel like I was watching an old ""re-run"".  What's the matter with those writers?  Couldn't they have thought up anything else? I would have given the movie a 4 star rating if it wasn't for that one scene which I felt was insulting to Trekkies who wait a long time between movies.

They reused the most beautiful scene from any Star Trek movie and basically took a dump on it.  I think I was audibly groaning during that scene, but it might have been the actors - you could tell they thought it was retarded too.

It looks good and moves at a brisk pace, but it lacks any depth or any real surprises. The previous Star Trek had characters that were interesting and were complex, but in this one they're all very one note and flat. Kirk is simply the impulsive captain, Spock the logical alien, and their relationship is simply what you'd expect given those character types and a little witty banter. Even Cumberbatch's character is an under written disappointment, he's definitely the most interesting character in the movie, but given who he is there's so much potential that's wasted.

5291829,3,B009934S5M,"When I first watched Star Trek, the J.J. Abrams reboot, I wasn't sure if I liked it. The action was action like, and the effects were pretty stunning, and everything looked pretty cool, but I was troubled by the story and the characters. I kept thinking, that is not how it happened and Kirk doesnt act like that. Of course, I was unaware of the alternate time line. When that was made clear I started to accept the film a little more. In the end I decided it was ok and when I found a copy, used, for five dollars, I bought it. However, I still had lingering doubts as to this film really being apart of the Star Trek lineage. It seemed too different from the vision of that Roddenberry gave the world.

 Then Star Trek: Into Darkness came out. I thought that I would see it in movie theaters, because I have not seen a Star Trek film in a theater since The Search for Spock. However, I began to see the trailers for the film, and I was not impressed. I saw an underwear clad Dr. Marcus. I saw Spock being argumentative with Kirk and Uhura. I saw a very white Khan. I saw a womanizing Kirk, womanizing to the Beastie Boys. I saw enough that I decided I would not spend the money to see it in the theaters. I would wait and rent it through Netflix, so I didn't pay any extra money to see it. I am glad I waited.

 When it finally was available to me, for it had a very long wait, I sat down to watch it with an open mind. I really wanted to like this film. I don't want Star Trek disappearing. I want the franchise to continue on and grow. I had high hopes with the last film that this would be the beginning of a new generation, if you will, of Star Trek fans and projects that would keep the franchise alive and well and Roddenberrys vision clear. Star Trek: Into Darkness dashed those hopes against Hollywoods rock solid foundation of sexist, macho, adolescent, white washing, token minority, marketing philosophy.

 I cant say that there was any major flaw in the film that went against the Star Trek pantheon. Though I was bothered by the similarity of the Star Fleet dress uniforms to that of the Imperial uniforms from Star Wars. Can Abrams not keep his movies straights? Also, what the hell did he do to the Klingons? When did they hide their faces from battle? When did they become such push overs? And the phasers, where are they? Everyone is using projectile weapons, even the starships are spitting out colored bullets. So, yes, there were major stylistic flaws.

 Uniforms and Klingons aside, what happened in the film were things that happened in other Star Trek films and the various TV shows. However, it was how this film did those things that makes the difference. It is like the difference between dancing and dancing with class. Kirk does have a way with woman, and woman dressed provocatively have been a staple of Star Trek. However, the old Kirk didn't get jiggy with it to the Beastie Boys with two women at the same time, not classy. The old Kirk liked his women, but one at a time and they were special to him. The provocatively dressed women, were just that, provocatively dressed, not in their underwear or naked. The old Kirk also had restraint, he didn't act like a frat boy, the way the new Kirk does. The new Kirk has no self control, just acts on impulse at warp factor nine. The old Kirk always showed intelligence and thought, before taking any action.

 Spock always defended his logic, but never argued it. He never bickered, he did not allow himself to be drawn into petty squabbles. The new Spock plays out like a tight wad who always has to have things his own way, a Sheldon Cooper with pointy ears. The old Spock only lost his cool under extreme circumstances, pon farr, or freaky plants. Now, you might say the death of Kirk would be a pretty extreme circumstance, but I say that Spock is still Vulcan, alternate time line or not. The new Spock is suicidal, worrisome, and has anger management issues, at least for a Vulcan. In short he is a basket case who makes a poor poster child for logic and reason.

 As for the rest of the crew; Sulu is barely explored as a character, he quickly becomes a token minority with a two dimensional structure and has little to do with story, unlike all the other films. The old Scotty was a knowledgable cool headed engineer, who controlled his area of the ship with a steady hand and only gave the captain overly cautious estimates. The new one is a spaz. He does nothing be freak out and run from one place to another, while never shutting his mouth. Abrams has turned Scotty into the JarJar Binks of the Star Trek universe. The old Uhura was a forthright woman, who played her part in the missions. She was a professional, who didn't allow herself to become distracted by the dangers that threaten the ship and crew. If she had something to say she would say it. The new one is another token minority fleshed out just to add to Spocks personality, rather then having one of her own. She becomes overly emotional over Spock, only appears or reacts to anything in relation to Spock. Also, Dr. Marcus is reduced to eye candy for adolescent boys who acts somewhat childish, especially when her father shows up. Daddy, she calls him daddy. Also, why is the white woman the only who gets striped down? The new bones if the closest to the old Bones, however the new Bones, like everything else, is over the top. The genuine worrywart personality of Dr. McCoy form the 60s was transformed into a hypochondriac Rodney Dangerfield.

 Let me talk about Khan for a moment. Khan Noonien Singh, the name alone should suggest that this person is of Indian decent. Ricardo Montalban, who originally played Khan, while not Indian, was Mexican at least. He was closer to the appearance of what one would think of when thinking of Khan. While Benedict Cumberbatch, a great actor, is a pasty white Englishman. I could not help but think that this was a white wash. When Montalban was selected to play Khan it was for a small TV show back in the 60s, so the pool of Indians to play the roll was most likely non-existent. In todays world, finding an actor, who is Indian, to play an Indian, shouldnt be all that hard. Also, the battle of wits that the old Kirk and Khan engaged in was turned into an ugly brute force cage match by Abrams. So, you mean to tell me that the best a superhuman with a super brain can come up with is punching and kicking? No wonder it took him so long to escape from Admiral Marcus. Again, taking away that level of intelligence and class from the dance.

 That leads me to the last aspect I wish to touch upon, there is no intelligence in these films of Abrams. Star Trek has always been marked with a certain level of intelligence and class, even when there was action. Abrams has taken away all the intelligence, there is now no difference between these Star Trek films and other Hollywood muscle movies with womanizing men and half dressed overly sexualized women. In conclusion, I am not happy with Abramss vision of Star Trek. This is not the Trek I knew and loved and he has not taken it in a positive direction in my opinion. I can liken it to a bad impression. Imagine someone performing an impression of a famous person. While they say all the right things, they say them all the wrong way. That is what it was like watching the J.J. Abrams remakes. A really bad impression from someone who hasn't studied their subject.

 Perhaps it is time for the fans to take it from here and make Youtube shows of Trek if the big companies refuse to bring it back to TV? I have started watching the progress of a production called Star Trek: Renegades, which is using the talents of Walter Koenig, Tim Russ, Robert Picardo, Gary Graham, Manu Intiraymi. I believe they are trying to get CBS to pick it up and be the company to bring Star Trek back to the small screen. I already feel that this will be closer to the Trek spirit than Abrams can ever get.",1385683200,6,7940,4.419288645690835

As a fan of all of the various Star Trek TV shows and movies, I love where this rebooted version of the Star Trek universe is going.  Abrams breathed new life into this saga with his first film a few years ago, and he has done a fine job in bringing audiences a sequel.

The cast is first rate and brings a high level of intensity in their performances in keeping with an action-driven plotline.  It's fun to watch this new generation of actors bring these characters to life again, and I enjoyed seeing their interaction continue to evolve under Abrams direction.  Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, and the others have made their mark again, and I look forward to what is hopefully a long succession of new stories with these fine actors in the lead.

Movies and storytelling must continue to evolve, and that is exactly what Abrams has done in bringing Star Trek back to the big screen.  The pacing is faster than the older films, and there are some differences in tone, but I like the new version.  This is an exciting adventure story on a big stage told with courage and imagination.  The starships are big technological marvels as always, but it is the people in them that drive the story.

That quality was played against a BACKGROUND of SiFi.  This movie was hollow and flashy, nothing interesting at all.  These new movies have been increasingly hollow and this is the most empty of them.  I am surprised as JJ Abrams was involved with the earlier STs.

This movie had nothing to to with ST except that they used familar names and vessels and clipped (and basterdized) previous ST plot lines.

Also, the 3D is done well for the home experience - completely worth the extra penny.",1385596800,2,362,4.323529411764706
5291840,2,B009934S5M,"Dumbed-down version has tons of 'action' but takes a well-thought-out scenario & turns it into pablum.  The only reason that the Star Trek franchise lasted through 10 original movies (before 'reboot), five series, and multiple books, comic books, fanzines, merchandising, conventions, etc. is that the original vision had internal logic and fully-realized characters.  Abrams has reduced the intelligent (although limited by tv budgets & 60's conventions) story and turned it into something more akin to Land of the Giants, Lost in Space, Time Tunnel, and other cheesy 60's sci-fi.  Kirk is a maniacal loose cannon with a death wish who belongs more in Sons of Anarchy on a bike...not in charge of the newest starship in the fleet.  The retro-fascist ""surface"" uniforms don't help.  And the oft-criticized ""bridge officers to the surface"" scenario required by network & studio execs to get the show on the air are just emphasized to a higher degree here.  It appears that 5-6 people run the ship and the other 400-odd members are just mute technicians or toilet-scrubbers.  And the laughable insubordination and fraternizing that goes on...it makes the Enterprise seem more like a club than a group of officers.  Unforgivable is what Abrams did to Pike in rewriting one of the best chapters of the original series. On the other hand, there are tons and tons of special effects if that's your bag.",1385510400,4,1396,5.065502183406114

As for the story, the franchise needs to move forward from the previous movies and stop dragging in devices.  Spock yelling, ""Khan!"" for example.  Rehashing the whole ""save the ship"", ""I will forever be your friend"", and the ""needs of the many"" kind of stuff gets old very fast.  There is a ton of original story lines out there which could not be done on the old timelines, however this franchise of Star Trek is on a new timeline and they can do whatever they want.

What did happen is that I started to get phishing email after I downloaded their player.

Pine can play various emotions with ease and gave life to a character that could easily be made wooden by many other actors. Chris and Zachary Quinto understood the relationship between Kirk and Spock.  Chris and Zachary were successfully able to underscore the fondness that Kirk and Spock have for each other despite Spock's limitations for human emotions.

If you enjoyed (or even if you just thought it was ok) the first film in JJ Abrams reboot of the classic series, then you will enjoy this film.  Cumberbatch does an excellent job as the movie's antagonist and makes a good compliment to the established cast, which have great onscreen chemistry and a good grasp of the original character's identities.
Worth noting, however, is that if you are a stickler for the old series' cannon then you may not be able to enjoy this film.  The previous movie utilized a good plot device to account for this and give a great explanation for whatever creative decisions the writers decide to go with.  However, some do not like anything that deviates from what they know and this is a deal breaker for them.  Forewarned is forearmed.

During the Eugenics wars Seven tried to make peace between Khan and his superhuman adversaries but to no avail. Seven did help to get Khan get off Earth in the Botany Bay to save him from being apprehended.

5291897,5,B009934S5M,"This movie has a lot of haters and the only way to decide whether or not you like it is to just watch it. I am a Trekkie, particularly of The Original Series and the movies 2-6. I enjoyed Star Trek (2009) but always thought Nero was a weak villain. The antagonistic combo of Peter Weller and Benedict Cumberbatch (THIS MAN IS AMAZING) makes up for that to the 25th power and, in my opinion, really makes this movie the gem that it is. Namely Cumberbatch, who somehow disappears into every role that he plays. He really does steal the show in this movie, and in a great way. For being so skinny and pale, he made me scared to death for all of the other characters. That, my friends, is what they call stage presence and good acting with a good script.

Is this a ""rip-off"" of ""Space Seed"" and The Wrath of Khan? No. I would rather call it a tribute. Most people who call it a rip-off and complain when things are different in the story apparently missed the memo that this is an alternate reality and therefore not a carbon copy of everything we were familiar with before. But the essence of the world and characters is still there. Also, I don't see how the action scenes take away from the story. There is a Roddenberry-esque tale being told if people would pay attention to the story. I won't call it a perfect movie either, naturally it has a few flaws. But the strongest point, and the most important to me when I watch movies, is how strong the characters are. I greatly enjoyed some more depth for Kirk, especially. Chris Pine plays a wonderful boy-Kirk who is in need of a major wake-up call, Zachary Quinto plays a great deadpan Spock, and Karl Urban is a friggin' fantastic Dr. McCoy. And Simon Pegg is hilarious, as always.

All in all, the action is good (if that's your thing), the story is wonderful and thought provoking, the villains are awesomely hate-able, the heroes likeable, and best of all there is plenty of humor throughout.",1384992000,,1947,4.435754189944134

I didn't get anything like that out of this movie. To be honest, ""Southpark"" and ""Idiocracy"" made me think more. I think the creators wanted to get some more mileage out of the epic characters from the original series. That is probably the only redeeming part of the movie and worth 2 stars. Still, the character exploration is mostly two dimensional. The original Captain Kirk was the product of advanced training and years of study, hard work and creative thinking. He was the best of the best, culled out of the Federation Academy. The new Kirk doesn't even want to join the Federation. Then, somehow, he just happens to save the world again and again and we never really find out why he is so great. I guess he was just born great. Scotty is an alcoholic genius who spends the movie running away from some unseen foe while saving Kirk and the gang. Uhura has a crush on Spock whatever that is supposed to mean. They never really explore the idea further. Essentially, ""Into Darkness"" is a two dimensional action flick. Terrorists bomb London, we question the morality of using a secret superweapon (drone) to kill people on other planets (sound familiar?) You get the picture.

This is what happens when people who don't know s*** about Star Trek make a Star Trek movie.

The story is Dumb with a capital ""d"". A blindfolded Sulu could fly the Enterprise through the plot holes. The acting is OK, although I did cringe once or twice. Pegg is a delight and Cumberbatch is brilliant [watch ""Sherlock"" if you haven't already]. The special effects are pretty good, but no attempt was made whatsoever to keep the pretend science even remotely grounded in pretend movie physics or medicine. Oh, and forget continuity: the movie is just one fast-paced sequence after another.

Look, an audience needs to see characters grow together before any strong emotional bonds are believable. Shatner & Nimoy's versions had a friendship established over 79 episodes, one movie and 15 years before a story like ""Wrath of Khan"" could expect to draw an emotional impact from the audience. The warp-speed bromance between Pine & Quinto is like the love story in a porno: empty, forced and hurried; merely an excuse to get the action going. You can't force an emotional payoff so quickly. That's Writing 101.

For a while I wrote term papers for cash. Even if I knew absolutely nothing about a given subject, with a little research I could fake a 20 page paper well enough to bulls*** an ""A."" That's exactly what J.J. Abrams (who confirmed that he knew nothing about Star Trek before taking the job) has tried to do with Star Trek. Unfortunately for us Trekkies, a screenplay is a lot harder to write than a college thesis. The grade I give this film is a ""gentleman's C.""",1384905600,4,1584,4.707581227436823

5291915,2,B009934S5M,"""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is the second movie in the rebooted ""Star Trek"" franchise, and, where the first one's awkward allusions to the original television series were endearing, this movie seems to be about a bunch of pathological personalities who live inside a video game. Cdr. James Kirk (Chris Pine) is reprimanded by Starfleet for violating the Prime Directive not to interfere with pre-warp cultures twice, on a whim, on the same mission. His mentor, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), thinks Kirk should get a ""second chance"". But a rogue officer, Cdr. John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), has just blown up a Starfleet facility and fled to the Klingon home world Qo'noS. The very hawkish Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) thinks Kirk is the perfect man to go after him.

Gene Rodenberry must be rolling in his grave. Granted the new ""Star Trek"" franchise has next to nothing in common with the various ""Star Trek"" television series and little in common with the long-running movie franchise, which was aimed more at sci-fi fans. This is intended to be a transnational product with little dialog, simplistic plots, and ample merchandising opportunities. But these characters could not even pass as 12-year-olds. Pubescent children at least try to act like they think adults would. None of these characters, not even Spock, is capable of controlling his emotions or his actions -not even for a little while. None have any ethics. The movie is more fascinated with crew members smooching than with any semblance of plot or dialog.

The themes run something along the lines of: Kirk does a lot of bad things. Then someone else does even worse things. So Kirk decides to do better things. And the movie interweaves a new backstory for Khan, of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" (1982). I think the writers were throwing a bone to the Trekkers there. Benedict Cumberbatch shows some of his usual charisma as the villain, which made me wish he had more screen time and better dialog. Apart from him, the entire crew is wallpaper. The casting director probably had to look far and wide to find a group of actors this unremarkable who could play 8-year-olds with ADD while wearing absurd 1960s-kitsch Halloween costumes.

5291921,2,B009934S5M,"By the title alone, this review may come across as immature or juvenile.  Yet despite my best efforts, I can't come up with a better description for this movie.  It's incoherent, poorly written and nonsensical.  It also apparently contains some sort of subliminal brain washing hidden in all of Abram's lens flares that cause people to enjoy it, because when I explain my reasons for disliking this movie I hear a lot of, ""it's just a good, fun movie!  It's got good action and it's Star Trek!  Don't over-analyze it!  JJ ABRAMS IS THE BEST DIRECTOR EVER.  ALL HAIL ABRAMS.""  Sorry, I just can't agree to any of this and I refuse to jump on the Into Darkness bandwagon.  Okay, let's get into some details.  And as a disclaimer, I will NOT be able to keep this spoiler free.  You've been warned and what-have-you.

The 2009 Star Trek reboot wasn't the best science fiction movie ever, nor the best Star Trek movie, but it was really fun and if you overlooked the flaws (which weren't nearly as numerous as they are in this followup) it really was quite enjoyable.  One of the best sequences in that movie, if not THE best, was the introductory scene.  It was intense, it evoked emotion and it was a great action sequence.  I had no doubt that I was watching a Star Trek movie.  The intro scene to Into Darkness was none of the above.  It was goofy, pointless and made no sense.  I understand it laid the groundwork for the whole ""we're supposed to be friends, Spock!"" plot point, but there are better ways that could have been done.  The biggest flaw with that sequence... why was the Enterprise under water?? Why wasn't it in orbit where it belonged?  The pasty black-eyed natives wouldn't have seen it there.  The entire reason they put it there was to have the scene where it rises up with water falling off of it.  But why do we NEED that scene?  It's a space ship!  We already got the Enterprise rising up through Saturn's Ring in the last movie, and that scene looked cool and made more sense.  This intro only laid the ground work for how little sense the rest of this movie makes.

So next we're introduced to the movie's villain (or merely one of them, as we later find out).  And he's mysterious and borderline interesting and made cooler by the fact that he's played by Benedict Cumberbach.  But wait... how does he convince the star fleet officer to blow up a building and kill hundreds of his peers AFTER he saved the life of said officer's daughter?  What kind of monster would kill hundreds of people for his child in the first place, let alone AFTER their child was already saved?  Couldn't he have at least TRIED to contact a superior officer?  ""Hey boss, I think some dude has it out for us, because he wants me to blow everyone up.""  No.  He's just a sheep and does what the bad guy wants.

Okay, I'll just cut the ""bad guy"" crap and say it.  It's Khan.  KHAAAAAAAAN! You know, the villain in one of the most iconic Star Trek films that already came out 30 years ago?  Yes apparently we need him as a villain again, because someone thought that giving this movie its own identity was a bad idea.  Not surprising since Abrams doesn't seem to have an original bone in his body.  Except this time Khan is a white gentleman, presumably English. But the character is Indian.  Okay... Well, as long as they give him good motive and make him an interesting character, that's forgivable right? WRONG.  The original Khan was a such a good villain in Wrath because he and the Enterprise crew had a history. He had a true REASON to hate Kirk.  This Khan's weight as a villain in this continuity is baseless.  He's apparently a puppet to a corrupt Starfleet admiral who found him randomly, suspended for 300 years in the vacuum of space, and wants to use him to build a star ship with modern technology. *record abruptly stops.*  What???  Admiral Marcus is going to use the 300 year old man to develop technology that exceeds current tech?  Who thought of this during the writing process?  It makes no sense.

That brings me to yet another item in the stream of things that make no sense: Admiral Marcus.  At first I really liked the idea of the Starfleet Admiral trying to beef up Star Fleet into a force to be reckoned with against the Klingons.  The plot of the movie should have been based around THIS.  I have a feeling it originally was and some producer put his hand in the cookie jar and said ""okay, this is good but we need Khan in it.  People won't watch it unless Khan is there.""  It seemed like Marcus was pulling the whole ""the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many"" schtick, letting one crew take the wrap for a mess that would lead to Starfleet needing a greater military presence.  But then I thought, ""wait, why is this even necessary?  Doesn't the Federation have the foresight to know that they're surrounded by potential enemies everywhere and that they already NEED a strong military presence?  Didn't Nero's super-ship prove that a few years before?  There shouldn't need to be a stupid evil plot to sacrifice the most celebrated ship in the fleet and all of it's crew to make it happen.  And why is Marcus so evil?  Why wouldn't he care that he's killing a ship with a crew of hundreds on it?  This is just bad writing.  A villain without a purpose, evil for evil's sake.  This isn't Disney and we should expect more.

You'd think the good guys, the crew of the Enterprise, would be the one shining spot in this movie, the one redeeming factor.  This is ALMOST the case, except that the 2009 movie handled the crew much better.  Here, Kirk isn't so much clever as a fumbling, lucky idiot (though I still do enjoy Pine as the casting choice.) I had enough of self-doubting, boyfriend Spock in the first movie, I didn't need more of him here.  Ohura is nothing but a nagging girlfriend.  Clearly there could have been SOMETHING more useful to do with her character.  Urban as Bones is still enjoyable, I don't have too much negative to say about him.  The roles that the rest of the crew had were easily forgettable, even the wonderful Simon Pegg couldn't hold this crew together.

I could keep going... (why did Khan put his people in torpedoes, of all things?? Why did they have to ask future Spock for help? Isn't that cheating?) but this is going long enough.  If the movie weren't so pretty to look at, I wouldn't have given it the extra star.  As it is, that was the only enjoyable thing about it for me.  I really hope that Abrams will be too busy with Star Wars to get his hands into the next one.  Perhaps with a better director and a better script for #3 (if there will be a #3) I can forget that this mess even happened.  May this franchise live-long and prosper under more capable hands in the future.",1384819200,4,6750,4.440912795436023

I was only two years old when the original series was cancelled, but I watched it early on in the syndication  around the same time I watched the Animated Series. Ive seen all the movies on or shortly after opening day. After seeing the pilot of The Next Generation, I didn't bother watching it again until the Third Season  by which time it was a much better series, and Ive watched the subsequent series, but not with the dedication I had for the original.

Of course, an adult looks for different things in entertainment than a child  at least I hope thats the case. When I watched Trek initially, it was for the neat-o things: phasers, photon torpedoes, the ship being thrown off axis and crewmembers flying everywhere. Later, I watched for the familiar interactions of the crew. Even later, I picked up on the social/political commentary embedded in many episodes. Not long ago, I was watching an episode called A Private Little War which concerned the Klingons and Federation arming different factions on a neutral planet, and I realized the episode was an allegory about Vietnam.

Many of these thoughts returned to me after watching the latest Trek film: Into Darkness. Its certainly entertaining, in that it holds the viewers attention. Like most genre films these days, its paced relentlessly fast. I saw the movie twice, mostly because it was in 3-D, a first for a Star Trek film. But it was a curiously empty experience.

SPOILERS AHEAD!

First, there is the issue of the villain, whos revealed to be none other than Khan Noonian Singh. Lets ignore the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch, while a fine actor, is totally unsuited to the role of a North Indian superman. Lets focus on how the character is written. Khan as portrayed in STID is a psychotic killer without remorse or redemptive qualities, who committed genocide during the 20th Century. This is poles apart from the way Khan was written in the original series, where he was described as the best of the tyrantsthere were no massacres under his rule. The writing, and Ricardo Montalbans performance, exuded a sense of ruthless nobility. During the course of the episode, Khan killed precisely ZERO crewmembers. It was for this reason that Kirk dropped charges against Khan and his followers and settled them on a planet  which subsequently suffered an ecological disaster. Even the revenge obsessed, Ahab-Like Khan of the second Star Trek film, who rightly blamed Kirk for neglecting to send follow up ships to check on their progress, was restrained enough to maroon the crew of the Reliant on Ceti Alpha V rather than killing them  although he killed several people later in the film. The original Khan and the alternate Khan are not the same villain, and the alternate timeline of the new movies is not an adequate excuse for that.  Further, what makes villains, from Montalbans Khan to Hopkins Lecter, interesting are when they can persuade the audience to understand their point of view  even if they are repelled by the character.

Secondly, there is the films portrayal of Kirk as a reckless youth, too big for his britches and not worthy of commanding a starship. By the end of the film, hes had his comeuppance. Whether hes matured into the character seen in the original series remains to be seen.

To be blunt, I find the portrayal of Kirk in the two most recent Trek films to be offensive. Although the new films kirk grew up in an altered universe from the original series, its worth remembering that originally the young Kirk was remembered as a stack of books with legs by associates who knew him while in Starfleet Academy.

The impression most people have of the original series' Kirk as a shoot first, talk later, bed down with every space-babe Captain is exaggerated. In reality, he was a lot closer to Pike and Picard than he is to the Kirk character in the two most recent movies. Also, William Shatners acting style has been so often and broadly parodied that it has changed the perceptions of casual and non-fans regarding his real portrayal. Its worth remembering that Shatners performance in early TOS episodes was initially criticized as wooden by TV Guide. Shatner did his share of scenery chewing, but those were rare and mostly toward the end of the series run and in the movies.

Take for example, Kirks alleged aggression. There are plenty of episodes where Kirk resisted the impulse/advice to act more aggressively against a real or perceived enemy (Where No Man has Gone Before, The Devil in the Dark, The Corbomite Maneuver, The Conscience of the King, Arena, By Any Other Name, The Omega Glory). In nearly every episode in which theres aggression, Kirk is backed into a corner until theres no alternative (Where No Man has Gone Before), or undertakes it to stave off an expansion of hostilities (Balance of Terror).

Then there is the issue of Kirks alleged promiscuity. He certainly had his share of action, but there were often qualifiers: under a spell/hypnosis/posession (Elaan of Troyus, Dagger of the Mind, Return to Tomorrow); amnesia (The Paradise Syndrome); divided in two by the transporter (The Enemy Within); the female was an android/simulacrum (What Are Little Girls Made of, Requiem for Methuselah, Shore Leave); operating under false pretenses (The Conscience of the King, Mirror Mirror, Catspaw, By Any Other Name, Wink of an Eye, The Mark of Gideon). He also had his share of exes  intelligent, independent females  most of whom regarded him highly, and vice-versa (Court Martial, The Deadly Years, The Wrath of Khan). There was one exception, Janet Lester, who was arguably psychotic. Kirk also suffered his share of romantic tragedy (The City on the Edge of Forever, The Paradise Syndrome), and was even given the brush-off (The Voyage Home). Finally, anyone who followed the series even casually could discern that many of these flings didn't go all the way. Somehow, I cant imagine the series Kirk bedding down with two alien females while the Beastie Boys blasted from his sound system.

Ultimately, of course, it's the writer who's responsible for the character's arc. Classic Trek was blessed with a great writer D. C. (Dorothy) Fontana, one of the few female writers in television in those days. She and the rest of the creative team - including the actors - made Kirk and Spock into complex, interesting, and imperfect characters. The J. J. Abrams franchise is run by post-adolescent fanboys who place cleverness and contrivance before substance  STIDs final act, which is a twist on TWOK, rings especially hollow.  Not that the new Trek isn't entertaining - but it's not a character driven drama  and it doesnt stand up to repeated viewing.  In many ways, this Trek is something I would have responded to when I was a child  but I doubt it would grow with me.",1384732800,5,6849,4.854202401372213

5291954,3,B009934S5M,"I am a long time fan of Star Trek and all it's many incantations so you may want to take this review with a grain of salt.  Also, if you have not seen this movie yet you may want to skip this review as it will contain spoilers.

While I will admit, the cinematics of this movie are awesome and the effects incredible in every way, the story was lacking.  It almost seemed as if the crew were going through the motions with little connection to the characters they were representing.  And perhaps, that's where the real problem begins.  This production would be beyond belief if it were not for the long history of these characters dating back to the 60's.  Also, a reboot has to have something more going for it than that history and cheeky monologue stolen from the past.

Spoilers:
While the original Wrath of Khan was an incredible movie with ground breaking special effects for the day it also had the plot to hold its viewers interest beyond the 'wow, look at that' effect.  Into Darkness could very easily have accomplished that without stealing from its past version.  Why not say Harrison was one of Khan's commanders, loyal to his leader, 'family & crew' to the point of self destruction.  JJ's 2009 reboot took the characters to places we've never seen while taking a few parody like jabs at the iconic Red Shirt getting killed immediately upon arriving on that strange new world.

What was good about this movie [not looking at as a 'fan'] is how JJ made a parody of the original Wrath of Khan.  In that light, it was pretty solid.  And again, the effects were really cool especially the whole 'ship falling out of space' thing.

So, if you're a fan of the original Trek and you don't like seeing that being slaughtered all to hell, DO NOT watch this movie as it will be disappointing.  If you're new to Trek and have no connection to the original, then the three stars I've given this movie are for you.",1384646400,2,1915,4.478386167146974

5291987,1,B009934S5M,"In an effort to both be its own film and retain the spirit of the original Star Trek, this reminds me of the old proverb, ""Chase two rabbits, and you'll lose both."" Couldn't be any truer here.

The real problem here is a gross lack of story. The more you think about it, the more you realize, not a lot happened during the film. If anything was *going* to happen, they rushed through it as fast as humanly possible to get to more CG action.

None of the characters are really developed at all from the last film, and while Khan *looks* cool and Benedict tries really hard to give him character, the writing just gives zero room for it. We get the briefest glimpse into who he is and sort of what he's trying to do.

But through and through, the film can't figure out what it wants to be. We don't really focus on anything in particular. We get a hodgepodge of characters, but they don't develop, they just act. Khan ends up as nothing more than a cartoon character. Virtually no exposition, no background, and not even so much as a hint of what the hell Project Genesis was all about. Benedict gets no opportunity to develop his character, or his relationship to his crew. What made the original so great is just, well, not there. They just don't follow that.

Now, that would be perfectly fine if what they *did* follow was interesting. But it doesn't bother with that. There's so much nothing going on, it just doesn't ever amount to anything substantial.

It truly feels like half a film, and they certainly don't even bother to hide that they're loading up for another sequel. But it feels like half a film because we get the action part of things, but none of the ""Why should we care?"" part of things, which is kind of critical.

Kirk is Kirk, Spock is Spock, everyone's everyone from the first film. But there's no real development. There's a tiny bit with Kirk, but just not enough. And the switcheroo they pull for the twist feels horribly forced, and also a bit saccharine, killing off whatever chance for drama there could have been.

It's really sad that nothing works here, which is simply because too little happens in such a long timespan. We get the Klingons literally for about five minutes (and they look ridiculous. Bright blue eyes? 'The hell?), we sort of get Khan *once* while he's talking to Kirk at one point for less than five minutes, and the rest is nothing more than nonstop action.

Look, action is fine in any film. But you've got to give me a reason to *care* about what's going on. The whole film felt like it was leading up to something interesting, but it never does. It ends so abruptly and without much really occurring, with an ending that is literally nothing more than setting up the next film, that it can't accomplish anything.

Very, very disappointing. Feels like one of those films that had enough executive meddling and arguing to the point that everyone conceded and got a *little* of what they wanted, but nothing added up at the end. If all you want is action with no drama or character to speak of, well, go for it. But if you sort of like to care the slightest bit about its characters (God help you if you saw Wrath of Khan already, because this whole film can't even get that one single character to be anything worth following), forget it.

An extremely poor Star Trek film, new or not. The original Abrams flick was far superior in every possible department, and it doesn't do a thing for Khan's character or the original film. Just another generic action flick without anything substantial guiding it.",1384387200,16,3555,4.514774494556765

I kinda would be okay with just forgetting trying to revive the series and let us relish the older ones.",1384387200,2,244,4.304347826086956
5291993,4,B009934S5M,"As someone who remembers well the original Star Trek tv show, this production does an excellent job of  creating a believable (2nd)  pre-quel.  It gives a plausible illusion of the original cast in their younger years, and Mr. Cumberbatch excels as a formidable villain.  And of course, visual FX are  up to par, as they must be for this type of movie.

My only regret is, I wish I'd rented the  HD version rather than the  standard def version, but the picture and sound quality were still OK even in SD.  (I viewed it full-screen on a 21.5"" iMac).  I think the choice of HD  vs. SD should  be prominently featured on the Amazon site  at the outset, and it  may be that it was, but I just didn't catch it at the time.",1384387200,,718,4.2611940298507465

I have been a treky since the first Star Trek movie, even before Cap't Kirk. and have enjoyed each episode. Technologically, ""Into Darkness"" surpasses anything the early writers could have dreamed of in the early days.

5292005,3,B009934S5M,"The effects were great, as I expected.  The storyline was a cheat.  After the previous Star Trek movie wiped the Star Trek universe clean of its past (allowing just about anything to happen since the time line and history had been changed), the writers cheated and took a line straight from the past with a younger Kahn, even to the point of creating a Kirk/Spock radiation moment with the roles reversed.

5292016,3,B009934S5M,"Not a bad movie. It was neat to look at and had it's moments (so, in addition to green chicks, this CPT Kirk likes girls with  tails?).
But, I've seen ""Wrath of Kahn"", and as whacky as the ""Genesis"" thing was, it was more enjoyable, with having Ricardo Montalbn in it and all (dude was a class act). But if all these guys are gonna do is re-hash the '66-69 episodes to conform to what they may have wanted them to be, well, I may have to pass on any others. (Bring back ""Enterprise"" - oops - did I write that out loud?)

As my guy summed up, it was ""oh-kay"". Didn't mind missing large chunks of it (to get a bite, answer calls, whatever), which seemed more like a PS4 game than a movie anyway. The story line had promise, but went overboard in digitized uberkilling.  Extra scenes of completely unbelievable ""action"" was tiring. I also pine for the day each story gets away from using time travel in some fashion. I'm scared to see what JJA has planned for Star Wars....Sigh.",1384128000,2,611,4.605504587155964

5292052,4,B009934S5M,"This continued reboot of the Trek franchise gives us a slightly different take on the original cast's second film, Wrath of Khan. No spoilers here, but I'm pleased to see our favorite Vulcan giving in to his emotions on more than one occassion. The noise over Alice Eve's ""exposure"" was no more revealing than similar scenes from the first of JJ Abrams' reboots. And it was so brief that all it did for me was to confirm Dr. Marcus' original film comment that ""Jim Kirk was _no_ boy scout."" Amen to that.

No Trek film rates five stars (very few films do) from me, but this one was certainly satisfying and complete. All I can say is that I hope TPTB at Paramount can talk Abrams into doing more of the Trek films. He has a talent for bringing out the best in the entire production and I, for one, would like to see that continue.

As far as performances go, they were about as good as you can get. While Montablan's original Khan raised the acting in the original crew's film, it wasn't needed here. Cumberbatch's acting continues to impress, even outside his unbeatable Sherlock role. His ""cold"" view of life around him actually matches his performances as Doyle's famous consulting detective and may be considered by many as an extension.",1384128000,,1241,4.585585585585585

I never felt involved in the story at all, which I felt like the 2009 did perfectly, and that makes plot holes all the more obvious and troublesome.

5292070,4,B009934S5M,Loved the re-casting of Khan and the backstory that drives his actions. Makes him more understandable but no less threatening. The young Kirk and fellow principal crew members are believable as less experienced versions of our favorite Star Trek characters.

But there's one point of absolute murderous rage that I still haven't seen because I know what's coming, and like CSI, the TV series, you really can't get certain graphic images out of your memory bank. So, that all being said, I never liked Chris Pine as Captain Kirk, and finding out not long ago that Spock actor is gay is a killjoy for most women. Admiral Pike and Doctor McCoy characters are very well cast. I preferred the first new Trek to this installment. Romance between Uhura and ______ is NOT believable.  Scotty is also very well cast.  Chris is a good actor, just not my pick for this role as I watched all the original airing of Trek on TV back in the day. The actor portraying the villain is excellent, but also not my pick for the role. (Too white, too British.) Also Carol Marcus character is British with no explanation since her father is not. I have not read any Trek books, so maybe her mother is British? Don't remember her being a weapons expert in the old movie in the 80's. She was a scientist who loved generating life, not blowing it to smithereens. I like the humor in both movies but letting children watch is not an option.",1383955200,,1303,4.336065573770492

I know it's a reimagined universe, but their dress uniform, and more importantly the hat(!), are distractingly incongruent. The engine room is clearly a brewery that's been redressed, ala Space Mutiny. The bridge just feels thrown together on a sound stage, the technology on it is eclectic and anachronistic.

I do find the actors have captured their counterparts well, especially Pine. He reminds me constantly of Shatner's Kirk and his god complex. The plot was pretty weak, however, and there's no attempt to follow any hard science. This one had too many tests of my suspension of disbelief.",1383955200,,721,4.909836065573771

But I applaud the boldness of the movie writers to properly 'date' the technology with all its potential foibles and flaws.

The acting was good and I was particularly pleased to see Uhura take a more commanding lead.  Captain Kirk was given wide birth to deliver his role but the other 'legacy' roles of Spock, Scotty, and Bones seemed slightly limited to a thin scope of persona determined by predecessor roles and stories.

In this sequel to the prequel that successfully re-booted the series in 2009 (both directed by J.J. Abrams), some initially unknown terrorist (Benedict Cumberbatch) has begun targeting the  leaders of Starfleet, and it is up to the Enterprise and her crew to root him out of his hiding place deep inside enemy Klingon territory.

Thanks to the screenplay by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, theres the same spirited verbal jousting between Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) over the issue of feelings-vs.-rationality thats been going on for decades now, along with a bit of a discussion about the needs of the individual vs. the greater good, as well as about whether the Enterprise should become involved with military conflict instead of just space exploration. But, for the most part, this is a straight-ahead action movie and, as such, it unquestionably delivers the goods. Indeed, there are some truly astonishing action scenes leading up to one through the skies of a 23rd Century San Francisco that has to be seen to be believed - even if believability is never really the prime factor in films of this type.",1383609600,,1448,5.206008583690987

5292134,1,B009934S5M,"As a Star Trek fan in general, and as a rabid fan of JJ Abrams's 2009 reboot of the Trek series, I found this movie incredibly disappointing. Into Darkness is nothing more than a generic Hollywood sci-fi script, where the writers did a ""find and replace"" to shoehorn Trek people, places, and things into it. Even as a generic sci-fi thriller, it falls flat on its face. I found myself repeatedly amusing myself with web browsing and online chat because the movie was just so dull and predictable.

A friend of mine told me these are the concessions you have to make to keep Trek in the mainstream. If that's so, it's not worth it. I've read amateur Trek fanfic that is light years better than the plot and character development of Into Darkness. If keeping Trek in the mainstream means having to pander to the lowest level of bland, cookie-cutter action, it's just not worth it. I'd rather it die in the mainstream and live on in the underground, where at least some people know what riches there are to be found in the Trek universe and ideas.

I lay on this criticism not because every single Star Trek movie and TV show was great, flawless, and philosophically challenging. The Original Series was mostly campy garbage, and the majority of Star Trek movies were total stinkers for the same reasons Into Darkness is.

HOWEVER, Star Trek can be and HAS BEEN significantly better than this. Just compare the Next Generation episode ""Inner Light"" to this Into Darkness thing -- it's like comparing Vivaldi to Britney Spears.

What makes this movie so depressing is that not only have we seen much better things from Star Trek over the decades, but we've seen some of that greatness even in the previous film with the same director and the same actors. Sad, very sad.",1383609600,10,1765,4.647435897435898

5292144,2,B009934S5M,"Let's start off with the following disclaimer... I am a huge original-series Star Trek fan, and have compared each subsequent series or film to that original show.  In some cases, the latter works compared favorably, and in others unfavorably, but all have the original series as the main ""yardstick"" in my mind.  This film, and its predescessor, fall into that same category... as far as I'm concerned, they exist in the shadow of the ORIGINAL, and must be compared to it.  After all, the original is still watched, today, after almost half a century.  None of what has followed on has shown anything remotely like the same ""legs"" that the original show did.

The reason that the original series was, in my opinion, so wonderful was almost something ""alchemical""...  a remarkable mix of many, many element which just came together to form a fantastic whole.  While the original concepts and much of the character development came from Gene Roddenberry, he was far, far from alone in the creation of the original Star Trek.  And much of what came into being grew, not from his imagination, but from the active involvement of others unrelated to him (Gene Coon, to me, gets more credit than Gene Roddenberry does, for example, and each actor had a large role in defining their own characters).

The design, done by a man with a real technical design background (in aerospace), named Walter (""Matt"") Jefferies.  The prop designs, and many of the more complex makeup designs, as well as the Romulan design...  by a master artisan named Wah Chang.  The music (not just the original fanfare by Alexander Courage, but the many other musical elements, in many cases long since forgotten by modern Trek composers, and to me sorely missed)...  the scripts written, in many cases, by accomplished prose authors...  some really great art direction and some terrific episodic directors.  It all came together to create ""magic.""

The original concept was that the Captain, the First Officer, and the Chief Engineer would be the three main characters.  However, this shifted as DeForrest Kelley as Dr. Leonard McCoy just caught fire with the audience and the production team.  Scotty was pushed back a bit, and McCoy rose to the forefront.

Many view the original as so successful because it played to widely recognized psychological models...  with Kirk as the ""superego"" (the deciding factor element of the brain in psychological theory), Spock as the ""ego"" (the purely intellectual, ""higher"" element of the mind) and McCoy as the ID (the more instinctive, emotional elements of the mind).  Whether this was ever really intended...  it WORKED, and that's central to who these characters are and how they best served in the series.

Star Trek, at its best, was always about us trying (and not always succeeding completely) to rise above our base natures.  It was HOPEFUL, but it was also real... these were real people, who we could imagine knowing in real life, but they were ""us as we hope we might be, at our best.""

SOme of the great lines in Classic Star Trek involved Kirk's morality.  Kirk refusing to kill the helpless Gorn commander, who had been trying to kill him...  and this is what proved to the keepers of the Arena that humanity had worth.  Kirk admitting that he's ""a killer, from a race of killers... but I choose not to kill today"" in another episode.

Star Trek, classically, had a MESSAGE.  A message that, as flawed as we are, we can be better, and we can overcome, and we can survive, without giving up our humanity, and without giving into our baser nature.

That... not the general shape of the ships, or the color of the shirts, or the names of the characters...  is what made ""Star Trek"" special.  The latter series tried, and USUALLY succeeded, in adherence to that, but the overall quality of those latter series varied, widely.  Nevertheless, none of them ever attempted to ""revise"" the original concepts and ideals of Star Trek.

Until JJ Abrams came along, that is.

The first movie, in 2009, was widely enjoyed by audiences...  for being a ""thrilling romp with awesome visuals.""  It performed better than other recent Trek films, and (in unadjusted-for-inflation dollars) was the highest-grossing movie in Trek history (adjusting for inflation gives different results, of course, but ST'09 remains among the top-earning Trek films made).

But that first movie lost the nature of Star Trek which I loved.  They ignored (due, I assume, to utter ignorance of real-world protocols and, more importantly, the REASONS behind those protocols) military logic.  Putting a fresh cadet in charge of the fleet flagship, ignoring the likely tens of thousands of other serving officers with far, far more experience and qualifications?  Not likely.  Uhura getting aboard the Enterprise through ""blackmail"" due to her sleeping with her superior... that's why the real military has regulations making ""fraternization"" a criminal offense (subject to prison time) for the senior personnel involved.  They failed to understand what a singularity is...  they failed to understand anything related to interstellar distances, or even intra-stellar ones (seriously, Old Spock could SEE VULCAN DESTROYED from his vantage point, but his planet was not swallowed up by the same singularity???)

Still, I could almost forgive all of that... the lack of logic, of thought behind choices, of the horrendously bad set and prop design...  if the CHARACTERIZATIONS HAD BEEN RIGHT.  But...  they were not.  These were characters who had the same names, and somewhat similar appearances, but who (for the most part) felt utterly unrelated to the characters as portrayed previously.

Karl Urban's McCoy was the best of the bunch, in my opinion...  and Zachary Quinto, given the script he was fed, did a decent job as Spock.  Chris Pine was, in my view, badly miscast...  a decent actor, but his ""Kirk"" has nothing whatsoever to do with the Kirk I grew up with.  They created a new character, from whole cloth, and named him ""Jim Kirk,"" and expected us not to be bothered by the fact that he had nothing at all in common with the character we know.  As much of a fan as I am of Simon Pegg, I thought his ""Scotty"" was terrible...  like a bad Saturday Night Live parody.  I didn't mind John Cho as Sulu... he's a fine actor who I'm loving in ""Sleepy Hollow""...  but I found the casting of Chekov and Uhura to be pretty poor, as neither actor had anything in common with the originals except for a partial skin-tone similarity in one case... and I'd been hoping that they'd hire an actual Russian actor and an actual African actress to play the roles.

Still, in that first movie, they retained to a degree the central role of McCoy in the mix, at least.  But they ignored the philosophy of Star Trek...  it was just wall-to-wall ""attitude, explosions, and pandering.""  And, of course, they seemed to be trying (way too hard, frankly) to put together ""the original series status quo"" in just a couple of hours.

In the end, I really hated it, personally.  The first film left me feeling like I'd woken up in the morning, gone into my child's bedroom, and found a stranger in there, pretending to be my child...  except in mocking fashion, torturing my real child's beloved pets and so forth.  Like a mythological ""changeling""... go look it up.

Still, I tried to keep an open mind with respect to this second film.  Having ""put all the pieces onto the board in the right order"" in the first film, I had hopes that they'd treat the second film as a ""classic Star Trek episode"" as much as possible, relying on the structures and philosophies with the original series so successfully implemented.

Sadly,I was disappointed at every turn.

At least in this film they seem to have settled on a size and scale for the Enterprise... in the first film, the size of the ship fluctuated wildly, from more than twice the length of the TNG ship (itself dwarfing the original-series ship) to just about 2x the size of the original-series ship, to one sequence showing it smaller than the original-series ship.  This time out, it seems that the ""JJ-Prise"" is something like 1.75 x the size of the original ship... but of course we get another ""hugererererer"" ship in this movie... which dwarfs the city of San Francisco (though at that size, its fall from orbit through the atmosphere at the speeds shown would have taken a seconds at most, not the minutes it showed on-screen).

The characterizations were not improved in this film, with the exception of Chris Pine, who I THINK was trying (with little help from the script) to give us a Kirk who was at least somewhat reminiscent of the original.  Spock was terribly disserved... and the ""soap opera"" between lovers Spock and Uhura was really, really badly carried off.  McCoy was almost ignored...  because, apparently, JJ wants the ""big three"" to be Kirk, Spock, and Uhura.  Urban did his best, but he was given so little to do in this film that it was shocking, frankly.  Pegg's ""Scotty"" wasn't as badly ""parody-ish"" this time around... but he still doesn't seem to be portraying a character with anything at all to do with the character played by James Doohan... despite their putting in a ""Scotty drinking"" scene.  (Drinking doesn't make a character... CHARACTERIZATION does!)  Super-girl Uhura was, to me, just horrendously FORCED... JJ Abrams and team wanting to create a ""feminist-friendly starlet character"" in the film...  except that it really doesn't work.  While Zoe Saldana is a nice-looking girl and I'm sure is a decent actress... the role that this character is supposed to play in this world would not the ""action hero"" that JJ wants her to be.  He found every excuse in the book to send her along on the ""action sequences"" but all this really ended up showing is why, again, FRATERNIZATION IS A REALLY BAD THING in a military or paramilitary environment.

The biggest secret re: this film, of course, was ...  KHAAAAAAAANNNN.  It was the secret which was never really a secret.  But, of course, they did their level best to make us not think it was Khan by casting an actor unrelated to either the original presentation of Khan or to the fictional-real-world nature of Khan, and having the actor playing the part show literally no common psychological or personality traits with the Khan we all know.  In other words...  why call him ""Khan"" if you're not going to make him even remotely similar to Khan as we know him?  I'd have bee happier if they'd left him with the ""assumed name"" he initially has in the film, and come up with some other reason for him to be a GOD.

And that's what he was.  Khan, in the original series, was a man.  A man whose genetics had been improved through eugenics (laboratory-level selective breeding, NOT ""genetic code rewriting"" by the way!).  Stronger, faster, smarter... but still HUMAN...  just representing the pinnacle of what humanity might be...  say, the top 1% of today's strength, intellect, and so forth, all combined into a single person.

But Khan in this film is MAGICAL, it seems.  His strength is akin to Clark Kent in uniform.  He's literally invulnerable to injury or damage (and has ""magic blood"" which, instead of consuming other genetically-dissimilar life, somehow can ""cure anything that ails ya!"" regardless of whether you a ""superman,"" a normal human, or a little round fuzzy lifeform from halfway across the galaxy with a totally unrelated genetic structure).  Heck, it can even bring the dead back to life!  And it'll only cost you $9.99... plus you get this set of Ginsu Knives!  (Yes, that's sarcasm... but that's exactly how I felt about this story as they showed that cheap ""McGuffin"" at the end.)

Naturally, they have a massive uber-starship which dwarfs anything ever seen...  and yet can be operated by a crew of one.  (Question... if you only need one man to crew the ship... why have it be so big?  What's the point of the size of the ship in the first place?  Other than to be ""kewlerererererer and hugererererererer"" than even the JJ Enterprise, I mean?)  And this ship, with the help of this one ""superman,"" has somehow led to technological breakthroughs that the entire rest of a hundreds-of-trillions-strong population spread throughout the galaxy could never have thought of.  Again, see, it's cause ""JJ's Khan is a GOD.""  It's faster, better, stronger, tougher...  and somehow, NOBODY IN THE CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP OF THE DEMOCRATICALLY-RUN UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS HAD ANY IDEA THAT THIS WAS BEING BUILT?  How, I wonder, did they fund this?  Girl scout cookie sales???  Who worked on it?  And is the JJ-verse press so totally controlled that nobody ever reported anything on any of this?  In other words...  is the JJ-Trek future really a fascist utopia?  Because, barring that, I fail to see any way that something like this makes any sense whatsoever.

So...  we have this huge ship... and why?  Because ""it'll look kewl crashing into the San Francisco Bay and wiping out half the bay.""  Again, a real issue of lack of understanding of science...  such a crash would not have just ""left a groove"" and knocked down downtown San Francisco... that much energy would have wiped out EVERYTHING.  The waves alone would have wiped out every city within many miles of the SF Bay.  The impact would fracture the San Andreas Fault, and anything still standing would be down in short order.  It made NO SENSE...  but it sure did make for a kewl CGI effect, didn't it?  (Crashing something the size of the TOS Enterprise would have been much more reasonable...  but you wouldn't get those kewl sequences of a tilted saucer ""skating"" through the San Francisco skyline, would you?)

Okay...  so...  characterizations - BAD.  Plausibility (remember, SCIENCE FICTION is not the same as fantasy...  it projects from what we know, it doesn't contradict what we know!) - BAD.  Design - only the most minor of improvements from the first film (at least we got minimal exposure to the Pabst Brewery this time around, and the phasers seemed to be a LITTLE bit improved... at least they didn't do ""product placement flippy shots"" to try to sell toy phasers this time!) but still, overall - BAD.

This is not to say that the film isn't entertaining...  but the entertainment value is based entirely upon the ""spectacle"" of it, not based upon anything remotely akin to ""making the audience think.""  It's not impossible to do both in a film...  a movie like ""The Island"" from a couple of years back hit the ""thinking"" and the ""outrageous action"" targets equally well, for example...but this one, while a rousing success on the ""visual spectacle"" level, utterly fails on the ""makes you think, and makes you care"" level.

And that second item - making you think, and making you care - is where Classic Star Trek was at its best.  Unfortunately, JJ Abrams and his team seem not to have a grasp of how to do that.

Fortunately, it seems that Abrams will have minimal involvement in the next film...  at the very least, he won't be directing, anyway...  so it'll be interesting to watch and see how a new director may approach this property.  A new team, even one including elements of the team from the prior two films, could make that ""magic spark"" happen and so there's still a chance... slim, but still there... that the third film (and likely the last one with this cast and production team, I strongly suspect) might finally give us a ""Star Trek film"" which brings us the things that so many of us loved so much about the original show.  Not the costume design, not the set design or ship design, or prop design... though all of those could be much, much better... but the charcterization and writing... the direction and acting.

There's hope for the future, but it's a slim hope.  This movie had ""hope"" too... and those hopes, for me at least, were totally dashed by this film.",1383523200,9,15872,4.815458579881657

JJ Abrams made another masterful (Star Trek) film, and it delivers even more of everything that you could ask for in a movie (as does the entire cast).  Chris Pine is outstanding playing the role of James T. Kirk, Zachary Quinto is perfect in his portrayal of Spock, and Karl Urban is the perfect Dr. Leonard McCoy.  Zoe Saldana is easy on the eyes and Simon Pegg is brilliant in his take on ""Scotty"".

Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, however, is unparalleled in this film.

I know that Star Trek fans and Star Wars fans are often at odds, and the movies aren't, really, similar in many ways (at least not to me), so I feel like they are comparing ""Apples and Oranges"".

But, that said, if Star Trek keep this pace up, as it has proven to, this franchise will soon lap Star Wars in short order with respect to writing, acting, cinematography, and overall quality.

Although I am certain to draw fire for this, this is the best Star Trek movie ever made, which is amazing because JJ Abrams is admittedly a fan of Star Wars over Star Trek.",1383523200,,1314,4.5423728813559325

5292161,5,B009934S5M,"I really did enjoy this movie, but felt very conflicted....with the alternative timeline they seem to be rewriting Gene Rodenberry's vision.  I know Gene and his lovely wife, Majel, are no longer with us (I do so miss her voice as the ships computer and I caught the reference that Nurse Chapel (Majel's original part) had been reassigned) and a fresh take on the story is always welcome......but how far can it be taken.  By changing ONE thing you start a domino effect that changes a whole lot of things - like Khan, it was originally Kirk that discovered him on the 5 year mission.  I know, I know - major Trekkie nerd freak out there - - but how much more could it change and how much more can it change Gene's message.

I did love the references to some of the old episodes, I kept catching little bits here and there, like the ship they took to the Klingon world was a ship they got in the Mudd incident a few months before....and OMG a Tribble in sick bay - doesn't McCoy know better?!

But these ALSO happened during the 5 year mission......and how can they explain how the Klingon's head are back to the Next Generation look (which Worf refused to talk about - have to be a hard core Trekkie to get that one) as opposed to how their head ACTUALLY looked when Kirk and the Enterprise encountered them when they were not part of the Federation?

Okay, I know I just did a major geek out there and did a lot of nit picking - I'm not a purest, but I would really hate for the vision that Gene Roddenberry put into motion be lost for the sake of an rewritten future.  Remember every science fiction movie, once you do ONE THING that changes the future, it causes a cascade that effect.....and yes, I know just a movie and they can rewrite it so that cascade doesn't happen, but just saying, ya know.

Now after ALL that nit picking, it is a very good movie, I recommend adding it to your collection if you are a Trek fan - it is well worth it. (some info edited, typos corrected)",1383523200,,1983,4.283422459893048

The reintroduction of the main characters and familiar characters from the original Star Trek movies is outstanding.  The story line has some parallels but does stray and makes this movie just familiar enough but its own fantastic movie.,1383436800,,305,4.96078431372549

5292208,5,B009934S5M,"I was SHOCKED!!! as someone who is a huge Star Trek fan I had mixed feelings for the first remake as JJ changed a little too much and I had to give it a balanced review, IF I had never seen a Star Trek anything I would have given the film 5 stars, but I had issues with some changes he made...anyway that's not what we're here to talk about...When I found out (SPOILER ALERT!!!!) that this film had KHAN I said ""Oh no...has Paramount LOST their mind by letting JJ mess with the best Star Trek film EVER"" so I waited and everyone stayed quiet and didn't talk to me about it. Sooooooo it finally comes out on Blu-Ray and I'm ready to tear the film apart...well it didn't work out like that, the cast has really come together and play their parts well (Karl Urban is PERFECT as Dr. McCoy) the film had a nice pace and the fact that they just FLIPPED the Wraith of Khan script was a surprise and by the end of the film I was in tears just like the firs time I saw Wraith of Khan. not wanting to give the film away for someone who has not seen it, great casting and the copy was perfect, I've gotten over most of the changes JJ has made, and excepted the fact that this is set in an alternate reality as the original series and they reference that in the film helps us old timers adjust...at the end of the day all I can say is BRAVO!!!",1383350400,,1331,4.045454545454546

5292211,3,B009934S5M,"Same problem as the first one. These actors seem like caricatures of the original enterprise crew. I guess it's cool  for those born in this generation. I personally didn't care whether they lived or died. The Enterprise seemed more like a prop than a flagship. Since  Abrams was inclined to stray far away from Roddenberry's vision, it would have been better for him to create his own characters rather than to mangle the established icons.
Anyway. if you like lots of things going boom and a movie in which almost nonstop action is the overwhelming priority then this is for you.",1383264000,2,581,4.742574257425742
5292212,3,B009934S5M,"I realize this is a prequel and maybe it's because I watched the original TV show but I have trouble with movies whose actors seem like children playing adult parts.  This may make sense for the audience they're aiming for, but seeing someone who looks like a college freshman in charge of a star ship is not believable.  Spock, who is supposed to be enigmatic and stoic, looks like the Little Rascals' version of Moe Howard.  The only one here with any gravitas is the bad guy.

Other than that, the story was good, well paced, usual great effects.  It's nice to have a little humor which is absent from most mega-science fiction.  I guess if you're young enough that these actors look like they could be in positions of power and command, it makes sense.",1383264000,2,756,4.522058823529412

First off it takes one of the most loved stories in the series and one of the most hated/feared villains and turns them on their head. Personally it took me a few views to embrace JJ Abrams' first Star trek movie, but I have learned to love it as I opened my mind to the premise of what would happen to an established ""universe"" if major, catastrophic events occurred that reshaped it. This idea is taken further in the newest movie in the series as what we know of Star trek is stretched and reshaped further by Abrams and crew. The plot is good, the action is great with just the right amount of humor and the special effects again are top notch especially in the 3D version.

Brought back some of the old ST memories from previous generations.  Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Khan is certainly among the highest of ST villains.  Rest of the cast was terrific but a certain moment towards the end that should have had me feeling angry just brought laughter.  I appreciated the reference but it didn't invoke the reaction that the filmmakers probably intended.  Overall, very good movie and one of the best since First Contact.",1383264000,,582,4.78

It's so easy to suspend reality and go where I have never gone before with Kirk and Spock.  As to this film, the  actors selected fit very comfortably into my notions of a younger version of the characters.  There is the bonus of special effects that are much better than forty years ago.  Triple bonus: Benedict Cumberbatch.  His voice is wonderful, and he can look evil if he sets out to do so.  This is a simple review.

5292239,5,B009934S5M,Just when I thought Star Trek couldn't get any better...IT BLOWS MY MIND! Best addition to the series yet not just for special effect but for story line but for the development of the whole new cast!,1383177600,,199,4.405405405405405

5292245,4,B009934S5M,I liked this movie a lot. i do feel that they made khan a little too super human for my liking.... but it was still pretty damn good sci fi. i do think the color pallet used in the fils sometimes dampens the amount of visual stimulation received from the film. i think back and remember dark sets and blue everywhere. makes for an interesting film but make my brain want to go to sleep.,1383177600,,386,4.16

5292249,3,B009934S5M,"JJ Abrams seems to be really good at starting things with fresh ideas and then losing control quickly.  Alias, Lost... it seems like he either moves on to other projects too soon (Star Wars anyone?) or just runs out of ideas.

Star Trek Into Darkness is a good movie if you ignore that it's a Star Trek movie.  Even with the reboot of the timeline (of which the original of the main villain in this movie would not have been part of), things in this movie make no sense.  I cut the first movie a lot of slack and enjoyed it for what it was.  This one I can't be as generous.

Too many ridiculous plot points that make no sense.  Why would you gather all of the top officials of Starfleet into one room... with windows all around on an upper floor of an apparently unprotected airspace?  Futuristic flying car chase at the end of the movie?  Sure, why not?  Kirk should be kicked out of Starfleet but keeps getting promoted for gross incompetence?  We've got that too.

I'm not a Trekkie/Trekker by any stretch of the imagination.  I liked the original series, watched most of some of the other series, and a little bit of the others.  But there was a heart and spirit to Star Trek that JJ Abrams has stripped away (even ignoring Roddenberry's socialist leanings)  He makes blockbusters... I get that.  But at least make it smart.

5292271,3,B009934S5M,"I love Sci-Fi so I would watch this anyway, but I don't consider these last Star Trek moves to be ""true"" Star trek.  The J. J. Abrams production team even admits they did not get the Star Trek philosophy and it shows.  This one has a few inconsistencies with the Star Trek Universe story line.  To me it seems like they are ""chasing the Hollywood shiny thing"" trying to get a block buster, and it just so happens to look like Star Trek, as opposed to a true Star Trek production.  There is another Roku title that expresses this sentiment called ""Trek Nation"" which by Rod Roddenberry (Gene Roddenburry's son).  Rod Roddenberry states that most of his life he did not ""get"" what Star Trek was all about and this documentary was about his quest to find out.  Like some other producers that do great original stuff but flub a remake (e.g. Tim Burton), Abrams does better with his own stuff like Fringe.  I cringe when these producers try to tackle someone else's production (especially when it's a classic) like Tim Burton did with Planet of the Apes and J. J. Abrams did with Star Trek.

Believability is another aspect of capturing your audience: One thing I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT STAND ABOUT HOLLYWOOD is when there is a spectacular and highly unbelievable sequence like Spock in the volcano.  I don't care what kind of technology they have, surviving that fall and the heat of the volcano was just not believable to the point of being dumb, loosing my interest and faith in the process.  Star Wars did this as well when they had the light saber fight above the volcano lava... and not a singed hair?  No breathing problems?  Nothing???  I think you can put together a spectacular scene and have it believable and that the believability is a plus. Incorporating the real life physics would even make it more interesting and dramatic but instead Hollywood always takes the cheap shot and chases the shiny thing, missing the opportunity's to create noteworthy classics.

5292300,5,B009934S5M,"""STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS"" -
review by James S. Cameron. (No, not 'that' James Cameron!)

I went into this movie with some sense of unease, as I did with the last film with the new Star Trek cast. OK, it was more like ""fear""; FEAR! (There, I said it!) The last movie, (the first film with the new version of the old cast of original characters)(?), the reason behind my fear was rather obvious, I think. I thought that the movie was going to ruin what I held 'somewhat sacred' about the original series with this 'fresh' cast of the old characters, that same ""dedication feeling"" which continued developing right through to the first handful of movie adaptations with these beloved 'original' characters that I'd grown up with in them, as well. When I finally managed to watch the last film, & happily, I found it to be much like a slice of pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving to me. So my fears were phasered right into black-hole oblivion. (There's 'got' to be an easier, or at least more 'condensed' way of describing, differentiating between, the various Star Trek casts, here!) (Hmm)

So you'd think that now, 3 years later, and myself having been so adequately reassured by that first movie, that I'd be able to go into 'this one' with a sense of ease and comfort... but noooo; it happened again. My reasoning this time, was that maybe the first film with the new cast had just been a fluke, and that the characters might suddenly turn into the cardboard-cut-out-cast with some badly-tailored hacked-up rag-of-a-script that I'd so expected, and dreaded, for the first film.  (I know, I know.. where's my faith!? Where's my Trekkie dedication? I've been humbled.) Well, I'm happy to report that I found this movie to be one of the best Star Trek..., hmm,.. make that best 'science fiction',.. hell,.. I'll just go ahead and go for broke, and put it in the ""one of my favorite movies of all time!"" category. (This might, however, just be a psychological ploy on myself, trying to prepare me for the ""next"", 3rd installment with the new Star Trek cast. Hmm. I don't know.. You think I'll fool myself? Yeah, you can do it James. Thanks. No problem..)  (!??!)

*Disclaimer:  I'm sure, if you're reading this thus far, you have this picture, of some major Trekkie/fan, some burnt social-reject from the late 60's, sucked into my imaginary fantasy Star Trek world, that attends Star Trek conventions, collects memorabilia, reads Star Trek paperbacks, breathes Star Trek.. LIVES Star Trek, etc., in your head. I'm really nothing of the sort, so you can 'mind-meld' that warped little thought right out of your ridged, Klingon-textured cranium. I consider myself a semi-fan, sure,.. but not like a major major one. I think I've only seen every episode of the original show, maybe 3 or 4 times each 'at the most'. (LoL). So yeah, don't EVEN go pigeon-holing me as some sort of Star Trek wacko/nutcase, OK? And like I already mentioned, the movies, after the first 4 or 5 full length features with the original cast, I burned out on them, myself. Yep. I 'did' like the Next Generation show, too, but only saw each episode once, occasionally twice.. some episodes I never even saw at all! (Gasps!) Yep, I KNOW; and as for the other trek spin-off shows, I had no interest in them at all. I'm a 51 year old man, and I proudly tossed my Vulcan ears in the trash during like my junior year in High School, back in early '79. So stick ""that"" in your dilythium crystal pipe and smoke it; all you who had already formed the total wrong impression of me! (LMAO)

Anyway... Okay, let's just forget about my own personal insecurities, my seemingly-overly-desired needs for Star Trek disassociation, and get right to the pulp of things; shall we? Why did I think this movie was so great? Well, for one, I found myself on the edge of my seat just about the entire film. Never a dull moment for me. Not 'one' single ""boring"" scene in the whole movie, in my opinion. I'm sure that not everyone will share my sentiments on that, for we all have different views and opinions, but I truly can only think of maybe a half dozen movies I've seen in my 'lifetime', that have achieved that strong of a grasping of my attention. I have to thank the writers of the film, I suppose, and the editors, along with a great cast of actors as well, for that. I appreciate too, that I think the technological level of the current special effects for science fiction movies such as this one, has finally reached the point to where there were maybe only a couple of scenes where I found myself 'not' believing that the Enterprise was an actual star ship. To where, it's now pretty believable the 'majority' of the time to me, not the 'minority' of the time any more. Surely, it's grown exponentially in believability from the time of the original series' episodes from the late 60's and early 70's. I look back and almost have to laugh at how cheesy some of the ""space"" and ""star ship"" scenes looked back then.

It had all the ""value-based humanism"" aspects from the original series that made it so wonderful, too. The morality thang, the power of love and hate - the lifting and devastation of the human spirit. What's more, the inner conflict that was set up within the core characters of the federation, itself, made it all the more compelling for me; right down to the admiral and his daughter conflict. And the Kirk and Spock bro-mance factor, actually had me in tears not just once, but twice in this film (I'll hesitantly admit it). I haven't felt that particular emotional string being tugged since ""Star Trek II, Wrath of Khan"", and it only got me once in that flick. This one got me twice!

I find the characters of Scotty, McCoy, and Chekov in these latest films to be even stronger than the originals, and that in itself, is saying a whole, whole lot. At first, upon seeing the Khan character portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in this film, (and knowing absolutely nothing about the actor), I was thinking.. ""this""? .. 'this' is supposed to be the same character portrayed by the great Ricardo Montelbahn? Just as I was about to go into semi-disgust mode, he started speaking,.. and portraying this new-Kahn character with such assurance and perfection, that I was soon just blown away and forgot all about Ricardo Montelbahn's old character. (Sorry Ricardo, .. God bless your soul.)

All in all, I'd give it a maximum number of stars rating without question, as you might have already guessed; and would strongly encourage anyone who ever enjoyed anything 'Trekish' in the past, in any way, shape or form, to ""yes!"" See this movie. ""Own"" this movie! Put it on the shelf with your classic movies, for it's surely destined to become one. - The END

5292304,1,B009934S5M,"Special Effects, is the only good thing I can say about this movie, and even then, it is only at par with what is coming out today, so no big deal.  These last 2 movies that came out on Star Trek should have been renamed: Testosterone Trek.  That is all this is.  They have taken everything that Gene Rodenberry wrote and used to originally create Star Trek, and pitched everything out the window!  There is no original thinking either, as they not only pitched everthing out, but then, resalvaged a few lines and roles, but reversed the roles and lines on different characters.  For example, we now have the same scene in Wrath of Khan where Spock saved the ship but died in the process, but now, the new and improved version of Star Trek, Kirk saves the ship, and dies in the process, and Spock fights to bring Kirk back to life.  Wow, can't get more original than that, but stay tuned, it will be Uhura's turn in the next movie.  And Khan, is not East Asian (with a name like Kahn Nunien Sing), but looks like a New York Manhattan executive, with a british accent, and asian eastern in name only.  I guess his name comes from a mixed (up) marriage.  What the hey!  They not only did not have original ideas, but the directors and producers had to really work hard and pull a lot of hair to find ways to twist existing plots and lines around to where the same plots and lines exist, but reverse the characters.

To sum it all up, I will not go see the third movie when it comes out.  I may buy the dvd only if i can find it at the $1.00 bin at Wal Marts.  When I saw this one, I kept running to the bathroom thinking I was going to vommit.  They are so desparate to appeal to the younger generation and reel in the fast buck.  Well, if the younger generation is that ignorant of good and original stuff, then they can have it.  According to these last 2 movies, none of 'dudes' running the starship ever went through the academy.  They just all came together at one time, jumped on board the ship, and started running things.

Both Trek fans and non-Trek fans alike should be able to appreciate the appeal of an action packed Sci-Fi movie. I appreciate the fact that J.J. Abrams appeals to us Trek fans by keeping certain themes alive from Star Trek II like self-sacrifice for the benefit of others or a greater good, friendship, life/death, and constantly breaking the rules of an established semi-militaristic organization where you advance your career when your superior is murdered or incapacitated. Well, you get the idea. For you younglings out there, watch Star Trek II first, then you will understand this movie a bit more. It's slower, so you might want to watch it earlier in the day.

Khan was cold, evil, diabolical.

5292323,5,B009934S5M,"Another great Star Trek remake. Khan is intensely cold and ruthless; almost chilling.  Definitely the guy you love to hate!  He is way more intense than the original character in the old series. Spock is more emotionally connected in this new series which I also find appealing and more realistic. Nichelle was a tough act to follow but Zoe is great as Uhura; I like the fact that her character has more intellectual depth in the new series and her mad communication skills are more in the forefront. A viable difference between the perception of women between the original series and today. The new character's fluent Klingon in this film contrasts sharply with the stumbling dialogue of the original Uhura character during the conversation with the Rura Penthe outpost guards in ""Undiscovered Country"". Karl Urban as Bones is probably the most like the original character. He delivers solid continuity between the old and the new. Chris' acting style is refreshingly different from William's and he portrays the character with fresh precision and realism. The new Star Trek characters keep the best of the old and add a fresh modern flavor which makes them relevant and engaging. The old Khan movie was not one of my favorites but this new one is so much better. The special effects were spectacular, non stop action and surprising turns in the plot.

Near the end of the film, Kirk delivers Spock's lines from the original Khan, verbatim.  I won't give it away, but fans know what I'm talking about. This was definitely an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. Absolutely LOVED this film!  Easily the best Star Trek film ever made, bar none.

It is intelligent and well written and well acted plus watching the Enterprise rise out of the ocean was worth the price of all three admissions. Characters are well developed and now comfortable in their roles. Wish we had more of Bones and Scotty but Scotty's scenes were priceless. Khan is a worthy new version and a far better villain than Nero in the first recreated version. A bit too long on the near destruction of the Enterprise but that's the way films are these days. However - and this is the reason I suspect some dislike it - what were the writer's thinking with those last lines - Spock defer to Kirk on where to go on their first 5 year mission? That is so out of character for both of them. The tension between them is what makes things work.

Now the movie review:

I loved it.  I am by no means a die-hard Star Trek fan. In fact, my first real entry into the universe was through the 2009 film, which I thought was a good start to a new franchise of movies.

Into Darkness was even better, because without having to spend time on character backstories, they were able to jump right into the story.  There were several interesting twists that I did not see coming.  While all of the cast is good, I was most impressed with Benedict Cumberbatch.  He easily conveys the physical strength and mental prowess of Khan.  I was also happy to see that several supporting characters (Ahura, Scott, and Bones) got their own mini stories rather than just supporting the Kirk/Spock story.

Perhaps the best aspect of the film is that it has heart.  As a fan of Fringe, Lost, Super 8 and other Bad Robot projects, one of the things that stand out about these projects is that they tend to tell very good character stories where friendship and camaraderie are central.  Into Darkness is no exception.

The movie looks stunning.  There are various environments represented and each looks completely unique and surreal.

If you like a good action/adventure film with great visuals and heart, I highly recommend this.",1382832000,,1451,4.748

  for star trek fans, this blu ray is a step in the right direction.  early viewers of star trek the original series had lots of questions about some of the main characters.  this blu ray cleans up some of those mysteries.  the action is outstanding and somewhat believable, but after all, it is a sci fi movie.  the characters pick up where the other ""new"" star trek movie left off.  the chemistry is fantastic.  these characters are young enough to continue on for many more features to come.  thanks for clearing up some of the mysteries and character connections from the earlier series that left most of us just hanging and questioning.  this movie rocks and hopefully there will be more to come.",1382832000,,708,4.637096774193548

5292363,1,B009934S5M,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Star Trek is one of the only television successes to contain some actual science fiction concepts, especially from 3rd season forward in Next Generation, but this movie, like it's crappy reboot predecessor is an action movie with spaceships. Into Darkness has about as much science fiction and boldly going as the recent James Bond, Skyfall, which is to say ... sadly ... none.

This terrible writing team has contrived a tapestry of action with artificial amped-up crisis after crisis--- the entire movie is essentially action scenes with a couple of pauses for clichd dramatic beats--- ""You're a loose cannon!"" ""This time ... it's personal!"" ""Vulcans should be more emotional.""

Most of the cast is terrible cartoon caricature (Scotty & Bones are abysmal Saturday Night Live sketch performances), except Greenwood as Pike (this actor is directorproof, great in Exotica) and Kirk and Spock are good enough to keep me interested at a very low level.

The things lifted from Wrath of Khan are numerous and embarrassing and exemplify everything that is wrong with Hollywood and the remake/reboot machine: No CREATIVITY anywhere. Too much attempt to please the crowd, without any thought, challenge or boldly going anywhere.

Looks like JJ Abrams is well set up to continue making Star Wars movies exactly as cluttered and contrived and silly as The Phantom Menace.

Cluttered Action Sequences + Thievery (aka ""homages"") + Caricatures = Into Darkness

It's sad that an innovative franchise is now a dumb, loud and thoughtless lowest common denominator junk. Sci-fi should make you think, but this pile of noise shuts down the thinking process.",1382745600,17,1682,5.18450184501845
5292364,5,B009934S5M,"While it's not exactly a secret anymore who Benedict Cumberbatch plays, I still felt compelled to add the SPOILERS disclaimer even though it says it on the back cover description lol. Cumberbatch delivers quite possibly the greatest performance in all of Star Trek history as the new Khan!!

I understand the uproar of casting a Caucasian as Khan. However, for the purposes of that twist toward the end, it was a good choice. It was the perfect casting decision to have Cumberbatch play Khan. Best one ever!",1382745600,,507,4.827586206896552

5292366,4,B009934S5M,"I have read a lot of criticisms of this film from fans and stars alike. I have to say, I can't exactly see where they are coming from.
I found this film to be very engaging, an excellent follow up to the first incarnation of JJ Abrams watch.
Right from the get go the latest Enterprise crew pull you in for the ride into darkness. The performances are great, with the exception of Benedict Cumberbatch who is, simply put, exceptional. What an incredible performance. His poise and presence are striking - a chilling menace indeed!
This movie is filled with action from the get go, as you might expect, and while much of this is edge of the seat excitement, you do miss the dialog, and character development that JJ's previous outing gave us.
Case in point is Doctor Marcus.
Alice Eve is not given nearly enough, considering there was so much that she should have been given considering her role in relation to the other characters. This was very disappointing, and one can't help but feel there was much that could have been sacrificed in order to add what was so glaringly missing.
What was added for Alice was a strip to the undies, and as has been widely commented on this is entirely unnecessary.  It did however last but a few seconds, and is certainly not worthy of the slew of complaints, and was almost a nod to the original series, and it's cheekiness!
That said this movie is full of excitement and swashbuckling fun. There are plenty of tense moments to keep you on the edge of your seat, along with heart wrenching scenes - This film left me feeling exhausted, but at the same time desperate to see what is in store for the crew of the enterprise next time around.
One further note. I watched this in 3D at the cinema, and both 2 and 3D at home. While much of the movie is great in 3D, at other times it is simply irritating, and whenever that happens I waste time thinking about the 3D being unnecessary rather than enjoying the movie. A small complaint as I personally love the format!
Bottom line, if you like adventure movies, exciting movies, watch this film, you will enjoy it. If you are going to sit and over-Analise every scene, perhaps not so much! If you thought JJ's first Star Trek Movie was the bee's knees, you'll love this movie. It may not be as good as his first, but it is 2 hours well spent!",1382745600,,2323,4.427570093457944
5292367,2,B009934S5M,"How can you possibility sit thru this movie and be awed by the rehashing of an actual Original movie.  Adding extra CGI affects, switching characters lines, and yes; adding women in underwear, in no way makes this an original. If this is an alternate timeline, then the storylines should reflect that. What next will Pike's clone be unveiled, but have a debilitating accident and end up in a wheeled box with blinking lights.  Wait...maybe a superbeing will enter into the storyline and they can call him ""R"". If your going to use  plagiarism to write ""original"" screenplays, might as well keep it in the family.

5292369,4,B009934S5M,"My wife got a DVD of this for a birthday present so we watched it.

I was always pretty happy with the ST TV series and most of the movies that followed the original timeline (with an occasional lemon) and so when the first movie in the new time line came out I was unconvinced. I watched the first one in the new time line, and while it bothered me that some that they corrupted the time line, I still liked it.

This is more of the same. Take a few familiar characters from the original ST along with some plot devices, add great special effects and you end up with a pretty good movie.

This one has several plot elements stolen from several of the TV shows, and several of the movies. I think they manage to blend the familiar elements with some new material so while there are some fond memories of the original brought to the fore, it is not offensive. At least it was not to me.

There are no great truths to be found. I wish they would go back to ""where no man has gone before"" instead of the PC ""where no one has gone before"". The rest of the show does not exhibit an offensive level of PCness, so why they chose to insert this just annoys me. But this is a minor annoyance. The rest of it is fun. Sit back and enjoy.

As for the Blue-ray itself, I had no problems and the picture is just stunning. I don't get to the movies often but saw the movie twice in 3-D in the theater - it was that good - but this Blu-ray was really outstanding for home viewing. The other day my wife and I (exhausted from raising an infant and toddler) planned to watch only the first 45 minutes after putting the kids to bed.

5292431,3,B009934S5M,"Grade:  Somewhere between a C and a C+
JJ = JJ Abrams (the director)

Moments that I enjoyed/things I liked:
Dreadnought (DRN) class - VERY nice tribute to a similar class in cannon but of a later gen Voyager class.
Enterprise (ENT) GOING TO (not in) warp (3rd best next to TNG and Voyager)
Klingon atmospheric warbirds - Very Bird of Prey like, kind of a nice salute in a way to cannon Star Trek (ST)
Carol Marcus - MUCH more true to the original story next to the Carol of Wrath of Khan (WOK) with perfect personality/looks blend
Officer Murphy, ie Robocop as Admiral Marcus, PERFECT casting for the part
The transporter, when it works, it is very old school cannon with the right flair for our times, really nice.  Same as in 2009 ST
Damaged ENT holding together, she ain't just beautiful, she also has GRIT!

Things I would change (but did not necessarily hate):
Khan and Kirk space surfing from ENT to DRN.  The scene was good, but inadequately explained why transporters would not work.  This was a CONSTANT theme of this movie in regard to transporters not working (conveniently) to allow a scene to happen.  And ALWAYS without adequate explanation.  Pretty lazy, JJ
Weapons exchanges.  Phasers, in ST, are solid and constant beams of energy weapon (both Ship vs Ship and small arms) not bullet like bolts of energy, which is completely Star Wars (SW) and not ST.  I fully blame Paramount for this for taking JJ on as the director per him being a SW guy in regard to his previous movies and should know he would go this direction.
Klingons.  The foreheads distinguish for each being different and not having any bling in cannon.  It is a mark of identity and honor not to be messed with decoration.  Lose the bling.  And the helmets, Klingons do not wear them as a toughness thing and always being able to see fully the opponent.

Totally Hated:
Enterprise underwater.  Completely unnecessary and what I found even more funny, Scotty even ranted at Kirk about that!  Right with you there, boss.
Uneven (and more so bad) dialog.  I don't know quite how to say this, but I feel like different writers wrote (different parts of) this script.  Some moments were beyond bad.  For example, when the team is down on Kronos and Sulu is in the chair, he threatens Khan in a manner that is COMPLETELY NOT fearsome.  And then, Bones chimes in with some high school comment along the lines of `I hope I never piss you off'. Sophomoric dialog like that permeated the movie.  I don't know how this happened, but I liked Kirk in the 2009 ST, more.  I don't completely blame the actor; because I feel like the scriptwriter (whoever did this part) TRASHED his role. Ergo my earlier comments.  He comes off as and a dimwit for way too much of the movie and is nearly ALWAYS braun vs brain.  This is the antithesis to cannon ST, the Shatner Kirk was an Einstein next to this guy.  Now whoever wrote the Khan scenes was BRILLIANT!  This was an even more appropriate adaptation of Khan than even in original cannon.  Cuberbath basically saved this movie and the scriptwriter for him new perfectly how to match the actor's personality with the character.  With that being said......
This movie had almost ZERO originality.  Bringing back Khan was a complete waste of opportunity to do something completely new. Don't even get me started on the switching of the death scene between this movie and WOK.  DRN by its very build had more survivability than ENT.  Typically when a ship is damaged ST cannon explains with full specificity the true damage so the audience understands a near future disaster or recovery to come.  100% not done in this movie.  Looking at DRN coming into the atmosphere, I still don't understand why and how it was more damaged than ENT.
Shields.  OMG, do they EVER work in these ST reboot movies! Literally every shot penetrates and does some type of damage in Ship to Ship combats.  Again, I blame Paramount for latching onto a SW guy to do these movies.  Shields are nonexistent in SW, and when they do work, never correctly or with any type of potency.  Just watch the opening escape scene from Naboo in Phantom Menace to know what I am talking about.
(while in) Warp Speed.  Horrific beyond description.  Nothing was more perfect than cannon ST with the stars going by looking like shooting stars.  It was simple yet awesome at the same time for viewers to understand the ship at speed.  In this movie and the 2009 ST, the ship is in some ridiculous funnel that just does not resonate. Per my understanding JJ is done with ST, so I hope in the next movie they go back to normal ST warp.
LENS FLAIR!  JJ again went overboard with this again.",1382400000,,4653,4.575574365175332

It contained so many ""in your face gimmicks"" I had so many spears, rocks, laser beams, pieces of ships and even human bodies hauled at me I thought I might never get cleaned up. This is a ACTION movie first and foremost. After the first half an hour I begin to think the script was simply ""RUN, SCREAM, RUN, RUN, SCREAM and KEEP RUNNING!

The acting, special effects, and cinematography were solid in and throughout the movie. The movie sort of resembled a Star Wars flick. Special recognition to Benedict Cumberbatch for playing such a good villain. I hope to see more of the actor perhaps as a Sith Lord in the upcoming Star Wars saga.

Though I found the movie entertaining the stories of the star trek characters such as Captain Pike, Khan, changed. Thus the writers are essentially rewriting the history and story of Star Trek in which I find it most bothersome.  What this does it takes away the original and genuine story of the Original Series in which I didn't like.

I liked the movie overall so I gave it a 4 stars.  The rating could have been much better if were it not for the rewriting of the history of Star Trek and its characters.",1382313600,2,929,4.511904761904762
5292469,5,B009934S5M,"At some point I had to check the credits to make sure Tim Burton didn't direct this movie. Compared to the first reboot it was pretty dark and depressing. I take it back, Tim isn't this mean about his darkness, and he is whimsical and somehow makes it entertaining and not sadistic. This movie gets sadistic!!!

If not for my love of the overall Star Trek universe I am not sure I would have enjoyed this film. Some of the violence went too far, and the story line felt contrived for the purpose of unleashing so much evil. Yes the original Khan Noonien Singh was evil and generally a bad guy, but I never interpreted him as sadistic. If anything, he was the bad guy you loved to hate. Benedict Cumberbatchs Kahn is not lovable to me in the least bit.

In essence Star Trek Into Darkness is the origins of Khan Noonien Singh, from the movie Star Trek- The Wrath of Khan and not the music band led by Chaka Kahn. The Wrath of Kahn was released in 1980 and Kahn was brilliantly played by Ricardo Montalban, and this film is possibly the best drama out of all the original Star Trek movies. Nice one to emulate, if you were to do a reboot- strong story line.

Unfortunately, I think this Re-boot went too far with the darkness and was not nuanced enough in telling the story of how someone can be driven to commit evil.  There was something missing. Then again it was a great film.",1382313600,,1378,4.329457364341085

I find the public necking between Spock and Uhuru ""high illogical"" for one thing, but what really gets me about that movie and now this one is that is is focused on 11 year old boys that play video games. Way too many special effects and fights do not cover up the fact that there is nothing substantial for a plot and the characterizations of the cast is mostly just wrong. Except maybe for Sulu. Scotty is a whiner to the annoying degree, Checkhov sounds like he has something stuck in his cheeks. Probably won't bother with seeing any more. They have gone where no Star Trek has gone before...into the reject pile.",1382313600,6,909,4.481927710843373

I've watched the original Star Trek movies (not the series, just the movies).  I never did get into the next generations bit.  I liked James T Kirk and his crew.  Anyway, I just watched this flick last night for the first time and I must say, ""The Wrath of Kahn"" fits it to a T!  So, I was expecting Spock to enter a closed area and die and then (maybe) come back to life in part 3.  The movie did not disappoint.  Someone important did die.  I wonder what the third movie will be about.  Are they gonna search for any missing crewmates?  And here I was, under the assumption that they were NOT gonna repeat the original movies.

With a well-rated title you expect to find moments and scenes of excellence, where the whole thing just comes together. Didn't find any here. First class effects. Surprisingly weak score from a great composer. Ham-handed character development; can't help but think that way too much was left on the editing room floor.",1382227200,,434,4.878378378378378
5292487,3,B009934S5M,"When a rogue intelligence officer assassinates Federation leaders, Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are sent on a dangerous mission into Klingon space to hunt down the criminal. However, as the plot unfolds we learn that the renegade is none other than Khan, a genetically enhanced tyrant from the Eugenics wars who has been frozen in stasis for the last few hundred years.

Star Trek: Into Darkness is a fun thrill ride from beginning to end. J.J. Abrams has successfully rebooted the franchise in ""Action Adventure"" mode. Hardly five minutes of screen time goes by without a fist fight or chase or an explosion. It is all well done, the effects are first rate and the audience is hardly given time to catch their breath or think.

And, from my perspective, therein lies the problem. For me, as I suspect for most long time Star Trek fans, my love of the series has always been about the ideas. In scrapping this aspect, J.J. Abrams has taken out much of what made Star Trek so appealing.

It's hard to talk about this without sounding pedantic, but, for example, let's take scientific terminology. There's always been a fair amount of technical jargon in the Star Trek lexicon. But up until now it's always made some kind of sense and been part of a carefully thought out and self-consistent fictional universe. In this film, however, when someone refers to a device that turns everything into ice as a ""cold fusion"" generator, it reveals not only what a painfully weak grasp of science the writers have, but also how far from Gene Rodenberry's original conception the franchise has slid.

If it weren't for the cast, this dumbed-down over-amped approach would probably ruin the film. However, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are well cast as Kirk and Spock and rest of the crew turn in solid and energetic performances which make the movie enjoyable.

I was particularly impressed by Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan. It's hard not to feel nostalgia for Ricardo Montalban's rendition of this character who appeared the original series episode Space Seed and later in The Wrath of Khan. Into Darkness' hectic pace gives Cumberbatch very little time to craft a well-rounded portrayal, but he brings such a magnetic presence to the screen, that he steals every scene.",1382227200,,2272,4.8604651162790695

The Bad - the story.  It's bad enough that I probably won't buy this movie.  Aren't there any writers left that can write something original?  They took a great cast and rehashed an old story line (albeit one of the best ones).  Now, if you're not a long-time Star Trek fan, maybe this won't bother you.  I suspect many of the 5-star reviews here are by such people.  At least the first movie with the new cast was an original story.

Very disappointed with this movie but the new cast makes me give it 3 stars.",1382227200,,645,4.352941176470588
5292495,2,B009934S5M,"First... the action was terrific as were the special effects and the acting.

That being said, this new incarnation of ST is getting to be very irritating, so much so that I can't really 'enjoy' the movie. The romance between Spock and Uhura sets my teeth on edge.  And they bring back Khan? Are there no writers left in Hollywood or are have they all gotten so lazy that they have to drag out this character and his minions from the mothballs instead of giving us an original storyline?

Every year, original novels are published from the STOS, STNG, DS9 and ST Voyager universe.  I know this for a fact because I purchase most of them.  The powers that be couldn't 'glean' an original storyline from any of those novels if they were unable to think up one on their own?  And the technology? This is supposed to be in the year or two before the 5 yr exploration trip begins.  At least the tv series 'Enterprise' made some effort to not be too advanced technologically from the original STOS.  And.. McCoy's little elixir that he cooked up from Khan's blood should be raising the dead all over the galaxy from now on. And with 72 'supermen/women' on ice (literally and figuratively) to draw 'enhanced' blood from, no one should ever die again..lol..  It all seemed very contrived.

And Vulcan being destroyed with most of it's population in the first movie?  I thought they might do something to set that right in the second movie but nope... it is still gone. It seems to me that this whole new franchise is creatively lazy and sloppy with their story lines.  And that knock-off of Kirk in the isolation chamber and hand print and Spock being on the outside looking in on Kirk?  Just weird... really weird and not the least entertaining or engrossing, unlike the original scene with positions reversed from the movie ""The Wrath of Khan"".

And, pray tell, how fortuitous that the Klingons showed up on the surface of Kronos right on schedule so Khan could take 'em out practically on his own but the crippled Enterprise hung out there for how long??  And the Klingons had no clue and never showed up to check out this Federation starship close to their space?  Highly unlikely.  And the Enterprise could contact Scotty in a bar on Earth from 'way out there'?  Boy, communications have sure improved, haven't they?

I guess this ST universe had no missile defenses or fighter planes (what would a civilization that could put a star ship in space have for homeworld defenses?) in place to stop a star ship from careening to earth, right? Like I said... sloppy and even somewhat silly!

And the Enterprise being underwater but couldn't move under water closer to the volcano to try to rescue Spock?  Or.. move underwater furthur out, away from the eyes of the indigenous population when it decided to get out of the water?  Khan could transport all the way to Knosos but they couldn't get Spock out of a volcano with their transporter? And how did Khan and Kirk land on another ship thru it's shields?

There were a lot of other inconsistencies but.. maybe I am being too nitpicky.  I miss the science and the moral quandries that used to drive the old ST.",1382227200,2,3153,4.599284436493739

5292540,2,B009934S5M,"Was very dissappointed in watching this movie.

The movie is completely out of line with the other Star Trek series and movies.
Young Spock in this movie is showing a lot of emotion and in the original series he is not.
Young Captain Kirk can not bring out the character as the original one which was played by Shandler.
Also the Klingons on this movie look completely different then the Klingons in the series as well as
other movies.

Spock gets launched inside of a volcano by cable instead of that normally people are beamed.
So do the Klingons. They also get lauched by Cable down from their space ships only to see later in the movie
that by some miracle the teleporter works and ppl seem to be able to get beamed back and forward.

Alot of inconsistencies in this movie made me almost not wanna continue watching it.

Special Effects are awesome, but the story line very weak and the actors should be replaced with another
set of actors as well as who ever directed this movie was definately not a follower of Star Trek the series
as too many details are not the same.

I will definately not reccommend to watch this in the cinema.

What was JJ Abrams thinking?  The actor who played Kahn looked like a 99 lb. weakling.  He was totally not believable as a super villain.  J.J. Abrams will ruin Star Wars next.  I guarantee it.",1381968000,2,468,4.634146341463414

5292565,5,B009934S5M,"I confess I rarely consider the ""extras"" in a movie review unless they are essential to understanding the film, or they are a major addition to the cost (such as with 5 disk LOTR sets or 3 disk Avatar sets). On this single DVD, the value stands and falls on the value of the film. I have never been a rabid fan of Star Trek, especially the movies, since I believe they are relatively weak when compared to their closest competitors, the Star Wars series. But this film may be the very best effort so far to attain a level comparable to Star Wars (lets say Star Wars II, Attack of the Clones). I think one of the very best reasons for that is in the quality of the competition, the fabulously talented Khan Noonien Singh, who first appears in the original Star Trek series in 1967, and again in the second Star Trek movie, The Wrath of Khan. The moral here may be ""never let a good villain go to waste."" Khan's virtue is probably based on both the screenwriters script for his dialogue plus the delightfully sinister characterization by my favorite actor, Benedict Cumberbatch (who is having a very good year in film). Cumberbatch plays it very, very cool. Khan is an unknown quantity to the young Kirk and Spock, which is why Spock somehow, consults an older version of himself

It annoyed me that the technique by which he did that is not explained. But that is one of the difficulties of fast action movies. There is no time to fit in the glue that fits things together. (Even the greatest sci fi flicks have that problem, such as 2001 and Avatar.) The advantage you have over the characters in the story is that you know all about Khan long before Kirk and Spock do.

And, like so many action / sci fi movies, there are many deus ex machina rescues which pull the bacon out of the fire just in time, and there are an equal number of whatever the opposite is of deus ex machina. That is, dangers, especially late in the film, for which no groundwork has been laid. It's as if the writer says, ""These guys are getting off too easily. We need to throw another monkey wrench into the works."" Too much of that and we have just action for the sake of action.

But, I confess, this film carries it off with a great amount of &eacute;lan. We feel sympathetic for at least a few of the characters, such as Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Sulu, and Admiral Pike. And, Cumberbatch pulls off a really believable cold, but remarkably calculating character who can appear to be sympathetic and on you side when it suits his purpose.",1381968000,5,2510,4.416846652267819

We bought the collectors set with 3D BluRay, BluRay, DVD, and digital copy and the star fleet phaser replica and the phaser is the icing on the cake and is heavy and appears to be very well made and substantial so I love it and play with it while watching both movies, it also comes with a really nice display stand, the only thing that would have made it even cooler would have been to have a place on the display stand to hold the BluRay movie case behind the phaser as kind of a backdrop, but even without it I still love this set and I am very happy I spent the extra cash to get this set oh and by the way the phaser is made by QMX and is the model that allows you to rotate the barrels from stun to kill so when my wife irritates me I can stun her and make her stop bothering me while watching my movies, she hasn't pestered me enough to make me switch to kill mode yet, but I always have that option available.... Haha joke.... Plus she's a pretty good wife even after 21 years so I guess I'll keep her around and when I use stun setting it keeps her alive so I can do it again if I want to......

The replicas they made for the first in this series which is static and doesn't have the rotating barrel and isn't as heavy or robust as this version is is selling for $250.00 or more so I expect this one will go up in value as much if not more then the first one has so get your official star fleet phaser replica with your movie and have fun enjoying stunning household members and pets while watching the incredible second installment of this long running series that's captivated fans for decades and will continue to do so far into the future",1381968000,,2075,4.002409638554217

Also, it didn't stream properly, so I had time to wait and think about what I was watching.  That's death to a movie like this, where you need to check your brain at the door.  Sometimes, if something doesn't stream well, it's worth purchasing.  This one isn't.",1381968000,4,335,4.627118644067797

5292598,5,B009934S5M,Love the effects of course. Love the tie in to the old characters and the accents of Sulu and Scotty. They characterized their original actors quite well. The movie was true mostly to the themes of the original also. Although they did change how the original Captain of the Enterprise died. Very very enjoyable.,1381968000,2,311,4.777777777777778

5292603,5,B009934S5M,"This review is based on having watched the film at home with my family on Blu-ray.

""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is the sequel to Director J.J. Abram's 2009 film version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-DVD/dp/B002HREH2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek [DVD</a>]"" and both are set at about the same time as, or slightly earlier than, the original series but in an alternative timeline. I'm not going to explain more than that because to do so would be a spoiler for the previous film and ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" works best if you have previously watched Abram's first offering. Abrams said that ""The idea, now that we are in an independent timeline, allows us to use any of the ingredients from the past - or come up with brand-new ones - to make potential stories.""

He does that many times in this film, which includes a lot of references to the most popular features and characters from the original TV episodes, from the Kirk/Picard voiceover during the title sequence to Tribbles, but you don't have to be a massive Star Trek fan to enjoy it.

I would advise against looking up the cast list on the internet before watching the film, because this would give away the identity of the first villain - which was such a closely guarded secret before the film came out that even Benedict Cumberbatch, who performs the part brilliantly, was not told who he was playing until a week after he was cast.

I say the first villain because there are more than two sides to the conflict and it is not at all obvious at first who the bad guys are.

There is some element of sympathetic parody of the original series, which perhaps can be best illustrated by two quotes from this film. At one point Kirk (Chris Pine) tells his away team

""Don't set your phasers to stun - their's certainly won't be""

which rather reminds one of the line attributed to his TOS character in a comic song, ""We come in peace - shoot to kill!""

On another occasion Dr McCoy (Karl Urban) asks Kirk ""Tell me, are you feeling homicidal, power-mad, despotic?""

Kirk replies: ""No more than usual.""

Zachary Quinto is magnificent as Spock (Leonard Nimoy has a brief cameo as Spock's older self), Pine and Urban are equally brilliant as Kirk and McCoy, while Zoe Saldana makes a convincing Uhura and Simon Pegg is an excellent Scotty (it grates slightly that his accent is from a different part of Scotland than James Doohan's was, but never mind.)

Special effects are, of course, superb, with the Enterprise managing both to look true to the sixties original and like a magnificently sophisticated creation of the twenty-third century.

The film delivers non-stop action and excitement, and anyone who is at all into science fiction is very likely to enjoy it.",1381968000,3,2781,4.856236786469345
5292604,5,B009934S5M,"A must see for any Star Trek saga lover. I loved the original ST best of all of course but the series continues on and I've grown to accept the actors of the latest, as the characters I loved in the original.",1381881600,,208,3.9761904761904763

This is a very good movie.  Blu-ray 3D is excellent.  Great cast, well written and an excellent director make this a great movie to own.  The ease of getting the digital copy is also a  plus.

But there are more.  Because it is the parallel world to the original Star Trek, it is a fun to find scenes that are brought in.  It is another fun to remember the original scenes.  It is interesting to know the differences between this new Star Trek world and the original world.
It's so interesting that I started to read the book The Hidden Reality, which tells the theoretical possiblity of the parallel worlds.

It's clever to weave in Section 31, from Deep Space Nine and Enterprise. As we have seen, Chris Pine is perfectly Kirk. Spock (Zachary Pinto) not only displays ""multiple attitudes simultaneously,"" we get to witness him releasing pent-up Vulcan savagery - beautifully executed. Benedict Cumberbatch is spooky in Khan's otherness, voice both fire and ice, and his threat ""You should have let me sleep"" worthy of Ricardo Montalbn. It would have been a treat if the writers had trusted their capacity to build upon the narrative strengths of their first outing - like the Spock(s) discovering Khan deep within subterranean caverns (a special Trek term) on a planet intended to be a new Vulcan colony. Sad to see Pike (the great Bruce Greenwood) killed, super to see Trek fan/actor/historian Peter Weller have another trip in the Trek-verse. ""Five years in space, God help me,"" says Bones (the great Karl Urban). We don't want to have to wait that long for the next installment. Enjoy!",1381795200,2,1107,4.956989247311828

Abrams has rebooted the eternal Star Trek franchise into a new timeline with a cast that more (Carl Urban as Bones McCoy) or less (Simon Pegg as Scotty) mirrors the original crew. But I can happily add that this edition not only met the high standard for action that the first installment did, it added a depth of emotion that both surprised and delighted me. How often do you see the male leads exhibit real emotion in an action movie? The mix of serious discussions and amusing banter was just right for my taste, and while the plot wasn't novel, the story moved along at a good clip, providing entertainment if not surprises.

Now i did not go to the theaters to watch this because it costs too much when you factor in the popcorn and the drinks. I could not wait for this to come out on dvd so when i saw that it was available in the instant digital section i purchased that one too. It was well worth the extra money.

This installment is fast paced and packed full of action and drama. The story line is wonderfully woven in and out of the original time line so those of us who are Trekers don't feel left out or that they are changing what has been.

This was our first time watching a 3D movie at home and this blew us away. I sometimes feel that 3D takes away from the movie. You spend so much time looking at the effects you miss the story. This movie balance everything very well. The 3D effects completely complimented and enhance the movie experience.

This was a great reinterpretation of the classic Wrath of Khan.  Really great effects, good action, great one liners and some pretty emotional stuff at the end.  What a twist.  Didn't know who Cumberbatch was before this, he did a great job.  However, Pike will be missed from future Star Trek movies.  JJ Abrams has done a pretty good job, even if he did blow up Vulcan.

I'll keep this brief, and tell you that this movie strives to keep Roddenberry's vision alive of the original TV-series characters.  Every cast member has depth and believability, but the director could have gone further with them...especially Kirk. (Special effects seem to take precedence these days.) Bottom line...""Into Darkness"" has a winning formula of action, suspense, drama, and a nice dose of wit.  I would say that it is even better than Star Trek.  The action sequences are some of the best I have seen in a sci-fi action adventure film.  This is a must-have for your collection.

Coming as a life-long Trekker, I was very excited for the '09 movie, and this one as well. Yes, I saw it 3 times (it's a birthday thing with friends and family), and in the theater it was great...to a point.

I think you can tell that it's Trek-Lite, and while not a bad thing, it's not a good, sustainable thing either. This isn't to pan the acting, writing, directing for what it is...but it could be so much more. There's some solid work in this movie, and good ideas that needed to be pushed out of the darkness and into the light.

Even with 5-15 more minutes of exposition/back story/character conversations you could have had a better movie with more of a substantive punch to it. If the story was about family, loyalty, sacrifice, etc. it doesn't go far enough on its own without rehashing what's been done.

  Now for those who are complaining about the extras I guess maybe I should look at those things but never felt that they add much to the experience. I thought having the alternate universe helped get over the slight differences in charactors without rewriting everything completely. It's not the perfect solution but it keeps the movie and actors from mimicing the original cast which would have been laughable. The tie in to the Wrath of Khan was not the strongest and the ending was a little weak but, it brought life to the movie that fits the time we live in now. As a small child it was easier for us to be distracted by Star Trek's simple special effects and we accepted those weaknesses. I do believe if they could have had access to the computers we have now they would have taken advantage of them and incorporated CGI into the TV series and more into the movies. Let's face it the original Kirk had a flip phone!!!!. Think of what we have now for phones....touch screens on everything... so why would the new bridge look like the old one. The phaser was just icing on the cake.",1381708800,,1259,4.418103448275862

5292690,2,B009934S5M,"There are those that hate the new Trek movies, and those that think they're great. I fall into the latter group. I think the alternate timeline idea works here, especially given that the original series, as well as the follow up series' all dabbled with it in one fashion or another, so it's not like it's unheard of in the Trek universe.

Though not the Khan we all know from the series and The Wrath of Khan movie, I think Benedict Cumberbatch did a good job with the role. He was cunning, clever, and almost oozed evil from the pores at times. At the same time, he portrayed a man willing to go to extraordinary means to save his people. He was believable in both aspects.

If the review was just based on the movie, I'd give it 5 stars. Unfortunately, I have to take points off for the horrible, horrible piece of trash foisted off on us by Paramount, Amazon and QMx.

Billed as a Limited Edition, and carrying a premium price, one would expect that the phaser replica included in the set to be of premium quality. One would further expect this due to QMx (Quantum Mechanix) being involved. Ordinarily, QMx, by most accounts, produces a superior product that they actually stand behind. Not in this case. Not only was the build quality of the phaser replica far below standards, QMx completely refused any sort of support, telling me to talk to Amazon instead. They also went as far as to deny any responsibility for the lack of quality control, stating such things were out of their hands.

Some of the defects encountered were:

- Spotty paint jobs, with blurs, streaks and in some cases parts missed entirely.
- Parts not lined up properly before being glued or welded, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance.
- The spindle or hub on which the phaser barrel rotates not being aligned properly, resulting in the barrel not turning at all, sticking, jamming and/or facing off at an angle when 'locked' in place by the 'active locking mechanism'.

Oddly enough, QMx claims to have used the same molds that Paramount used when filming the movies to make these. Given the subpar build quality, I question the validity of that particular statement.

Overall, I'd have to say stay away from this particular product. If you're interested in the movie itself, there are several other options available. Given the premium cost of this set, and the ridiculously cheap build quality and lack of quality control or support from the manufacturer of the phaser replica, this set is absolutely not worth the price being charged by Amazon.",1381708800,,2530,4.710407239819005
5292691,3,B009934S5M,"I liked the first Star Trek Much better than this one. But, it was nice to see the characters get going in something new. I recommend you check it out once, but you'll probably never watch it again or at-least for a couple of years.",1381708800,,232,4.177777777777778

I think this was probably one of his favorite Father's Day gifts ever! He spent the next three weeks watching and re-watching every movie in the series with our 8-year old son (though we did have to fast forward through a few scenes that were especially violent).  Since this movie wasn't released on DVD until September, he also had something to look forward to once he'd finished all the other Star Trek movies.

The newer movies (this one and Star-Trek) are his favorites, but he has really enjoyed having the entire collection and I'm sure these are movies he will enjoy watching again and again. He's already watched all of them at least twice, some three times - and we've only had them a few months!

Enterprise, then  you'll love ""Star Trek: Into The Darkness"".  To Be fair, the actors give fantastic performances.  Chris Pine, as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, and the other actors who reprise their roles of the Enterprise crew have absolutely grown in their roles and as before are a joy to watch.  For viewers remotely familiar with Star Trek's television canon, there are deep mischaracterizations of the ""villain"" Khan.  These mischaracterizations are aside from altering his initial ethnicity (In the 1967 ""Space Seed"" Khan Noonian SIngh appears of Indian extraction - in the film, he is British}.  In the TV episode, the ""Space Seed"" script and Ricardo Montalban's performance crafted the 300 year old frozen superman as a suave, commanding, charismatic leader who was as much a ladie's man as he was a tactician and intellect.  In contrast, Orci and Kurtzman's script has dumbed down Khan to the level of a vindictive, reactive wounded wolf who leaps before he looks in attempting to manipulate Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise into serving his goals of rescuing his fellow frozen supermen. The film also does not pay full homage to Roddenberry's depiction of a 23rd century United Federation of Planets that is pushing out colonies into the far reaches of the galaxy.  The script isolates almost all of the terrorist and political damage on Earth.  The initial terrorist incursion is in a visually stylistic London, the Star Fleet council that is convened to consider the events is also on Earth and the threat from Khan seems primarily aimed at Earth. Other than the Klingons, we have little sense of the rest of  human colonization.  Those who may be aware of Abrams,Orci's and Kurtzman's preference for Star Wars will also note that as in, the earlier 2009 film there is obvious Star Wars homage.  The situation is that the Enterprise crew needs a stealth way into a Klingon stronghold without identifying themselves as Federation - so Kirk orders that the ship from their recent ""Mudd incident"" be manned by Kirk, Spock and Uhura in an attempt to get past the Kiingon defences.  The shape of Mudd's freighter has an odd commonality with a miniature plain surface version of the Millenium Falcon. The bantering that goes on amid the characters, while different in content, is reminiscent of the camaraderie of Skywalker, Leia and Solo. The external shots of the ship's evasion of mountains and pursuing Klingon vessels involves side swipes that seem to pull directly from the cinematography of the Millennium Falcon in it's desperate efforts to escape the Empire's pursuit in Star Wars. For mindless action entertainment and adequate blue screen cinematography you can get away with spending a couple hours watching this film - but don't expect much of a take-away, other han a few smiles for enjoyable nostalgic character enactments by some truly gifted actors.",1381708800,16,3095,5.007797270955166

For any intelligent person out there who understands physics, when you're in an object that's in free fall, you are also in free fall, accelerating at the same rate as what Earth's gravity pulls on you, meaning you are weightless, ZERO G, again WEIGHTLESS, not flying all over the place.

One would think that the overhead cost to stream should be significantly less that the overhead cost to transport and store physical DVDs in a DVD kiosk.

Yet Amazon's price-point to stream this movie in HD is more than 3x the price to rent a physical BlueRay DVD from the local red-colored DVD kiosk.

5292721,1,B009934S5M,"Turn off your mind and you might enjoy this movie.  The movie is cliche filled. It has a weak and uncompelling story. It starts off like a sit com and the story telling does improve somewhat as it goes along.  If you manage to not get thrown out repeatedly by the gaping plot failures like having to bring the Enterprise out of it's ocean hiding spot in order to transport Spock to safety from the inside of a single erupting volcano that if not stopped will somehow destroy the entire planet to 300 year old genetically enhanced villain being able to transport himself from just outside Starfleet headquarters to an isolated location (if I understood correctly)on the Klingon home world, you might be able to accept it for a fun romp of a juvenile version of the cast of the original series.

Two thumbs up to the obligatory cat women found in Jim's bed as well as the necessity for the hot science officer to unnecessarily undress in a shuttle while admonishing Jim to face the other way.

My best description is that the movie is nothing but a prop of some emo screen writer's fantasy to allow Jim and Spock to have many emotionally charged moments together.",1381622400,13,1161,4.5673076923076925

Others appreciate the global inclusion of other cultures -- even alien cultures. Still others enjoy the invented languages, or the fashions, or the unpredictable plots that bring back the dead, rescue the whales, or have to put up with Q.

This new movie is infinitely easier to watch, the action is engrossing, the story line is very god and the performances of the actors and actresses is excellent.

It is clear that the executives are finally showing their true faces & the hate they have carried against Star Trek but dared not to show until Majel was gone for fear they would be denounced for what they are & lose control of the Franchise. The only reason anyone tolerates it is because there is no other alternative Star Trek available and no one with enough power to boot them out of the franchise.

The Roddenberry's are likely spinning in their graves over these reboot films.

In addition to the mutilation of past storylines (because they obviously can't think of anything original) they show their hate of the franchise by destroying things held most dear such as Vulcan & the original crew just to get back at the Roddenberry's & original fans. No one who truly cares about a franchise would ever cater to those who wish to destroy the canon & slap the core fans in the face unless it was an ultimate act of animosity while holding the original fans hostage to their defecation on a beloved institution.

If anyone would bother to rewatch the original series, they would see Kirk was a soft spoken warm, gentle character. A romantic with intense loyalty willing to take risks to save his ship. He was never the wild, out of control cowboy, he has been portrayed. Nor was Spock ever adversarial or harmful to Kirk. Nor would Scotty ever defy Kirk in such a manner. Nor McCoy such a scatterbrain.

Sure, fans would love to see more new, original episodes of TOS & their younger years but not destroying every character & storyline as has been done. Much worse, leaving it in the hands of some hopped-up, flashlight obsessed, warped minded, microphone addicted lunatic like Abrams. They are clearly out of touch & someone needs to repair the damage.",1381449600,13,1907,4.700598802395209
5292795,4,B009934S5M,"You may read this as though I'm a Trek fan or I'm not. I don't care.

The movie itself is easily a 5 star rating. Perhaps sequel isn't precisely the right word for this. In any event, this is one of those rare sequels that is the equal of it's predecessor (predecessors?). I won't go any further into reviewing the movie except to say that I enjoyed it immensely. Star Trek, regardless of which generation, is one of those things that people will either watch or they won't. No amount of glowing reviews will change that.

Video: Excellent. 5 stars, hands down. I watched this twice on my 55"" Samsung 8000 series LED TV. There is absolutely nothing to distract. No banding, artifacting, etc. This is as perfect an image as possible, short of actually being in the movie. I do not give such ratings lightly, when it comes to video or audio quality. I am generally very unforgiving, when it comes to that sort of thing. Video wise, this is a perfect Bluray.

(And yes, the lens flares are in this one too. Get over it.)

Audio: Fair ...at best. 3 stars. Played through an Onkyo 7.2 receiver powering Definitive Technology speakers. 7006's (built in 300W subs) as mains. A BP8 as a center channel, and 4 350's as side and rear channels. I mention all that because these are excellent speakers (merely a good receiver) and you need to know where I'm coming from and why I rated the audio so poorly. The 7.1 Dolby TrueHD audio track is only okay. Bass is mostly fine. There are a very few slightly weak points but nothing troubling. That's not to say the bass is fantastic either. It's quite good but never hits that level of true awesomeness that I expected from this movie. The mids and highs are simply fall down dead. Weak, anemic, and lame all come to mind as good adjectives. There is a lot of audio surround going on. Phasers, explosions, and such in front, to the side and behind. Stuff whizzing by. It's wild and chaotic and it's supposed to be. The problem is it sounds like hell. The mids and highs both sound flat and utterly lacking in any clarity. I even turned the volume WWWWAAAAAYYYYYY up for a time to really, really listen. The goodness just isn't there. Even in the fairly subdued scenes (few as they are), there's a fair amount of background audio going on. It sounds slightly muffled and it's somewhat difficult to discern to the point of being quite distracting. The dialog suffers all of the same issues as the rest of the track. Flat and empty. It never gets to the point of indecipherable which I suppose is a plus. Although I did have to turn my center level up much higher than I normally keep it. +12 dB instead +2dB. I'd almost say the audio track is lossy but I didn't hear any of the tell tale slight warble or tinniness that comes with compressed audio. Still, I'm not convinced it isn't lossy. Honestly, I think the culprit here is Dolby True-HD and bad mastering. I strongly suspect this would have been a 5 star track, if it had been DTS-HD Master.

Having given the audio as much of a thrashing as I just did (told you I was unforgiving), you will now likely be surprised to find that I haven't gotten to the critical flaw I mentioned in my title. Here it is. The audio is out of sync with the video. This is absolutely, 100% UNFORGIVABLE! That goes for any movie, of course, but especially for one of this pedigree. It gets worse. Okay so any halfway decent Home Theater setup can delay the audio to make it sync up. That's the thing, I couldn't fix it. My receiver can set a delay in 10 ms increments. 20 isn't enough and 30 is ever so slightly too much.

There's no excuse for this. Paramount ruined an otherwise great movie experience with a hack job on the audio in their rush to get the disc on shelves so they could dive into additional profits like Scrooge McDuck.  I'm terribly disappointed with this audio. If I find a Bluray with DTS-HD audio then this copy will immediately become my new beer coaster. Thanks Paramount. <--- That sentence is known as sarcasm. I will never pre-order a movie again.",1381449600,,4041,4.445344129554656

Unthinkable.

What happens when a benevolent group of people are attacked without warning.  What choices do they make as a result?  Do they hold to their high ideals?  Or do they turn inward and become the bad guys?  The theme is rather clear and, like Ray Bradbury would say, talks about the real world in a way that you could get away with.  Talking about it in the realm of science fiction.

It does have a political point of view that some won't like. But, in my view, it's a political point of view that's pretty truthful.

5292816,5,B009934S5M,"I've been a fan since the syndication runs of the 70's and always liked the original crew.  JJ Abrams pulled off something very hard to do.  If this was a rock band, he essentially did the equivalent of replacing all of the members of the band.  Success was helped by casting excellent actors and keeping the story moving at a fast pace.  Somehow with the rapid forward movement, character development has some time to ferment but not enough for the supporting cast because of time limitations.  The 2nd foray with this crew is a twist on a original series story and for me it works.  There's gravity around the actions of the characters and touching emotional performances by Pine and Quinto.

I would say that Roddenberry would not have approved of this film however.  He was against the militarization of Star Trek and wanted to focus on social issues.  I have to say, I'm glad JJ Abrams stuck to his own vision and gave is this exciting ""A"" grade film.",1381449600,,956,4.576470588235294

3) Almost apparently realistic effects, until the last part of the Movie.  Obviously the re-entry scene is slightly exaggerated.
4) Audio was pretty good, and find I didn't have to continuously turn down the sound during loud bass events.  (Maybe it's just me, I didn't analyze this much, or maybe it was due to the Amazon HD streaming?)
5) The movie had an unpredictable plot.  (Seemed to mock the legal scenario of, telling the whole truth or finding the rest of the story.)

1) The eye liner on the male actors.  (On second thought, think the male actors had more makeup on then the female actors.  Maybe the male actors required it?)",1381363200,2,1026,4.862068965517241

the emotions and intellects of the various cast members.  They also cast as the villain Benedict
Cumberbatch who is becoming one of the great actors of his generation as Kahn the greatest

5292860,5,B009934S5M,"The gift of a new time line given in the most recent version of Star Trek is apparently going to be milked for all it is worth. Here we have the reshaped story of Khan and what he did to our beloved Enterprise crew. Though I admit the new crew is less dignified and military minded than the original series (and it's movies and spin-offs), the changes initiated by the previous movie's story can explain it. Mind you, my take on the result would have been a MORE disciplined military state, but you can't have everything you want. I actually like the more extreme entertainment levels we get with the resulting characters and their crazy antics.

5292866,2,B009934S5M,"One of my groupies asked for a review of Star Trek - Into Darkness.  I had it on my watch list anyway, so I figured what the heck.  Rock stars sometimes take requests... so I might as well too.

The first 10 minutes are some of the most nonsensical in the history of film.

The film starts out with the crew of the Enterprise attempting to save a primitive civilization from an erupting volcano.  Kirk and Bones are running through the woods being chased by the natives while Spock is being lowered into the volcano with a device to stop the eruption.

Apparently Kirk and Bones have stolen a holy relic from the natives in order to provide a distraction so that the natives won't see a shuttlecraft fly into the cloud above the volcano.  On the other hand, Kirk tells the shuttle that the ""locals are out of the kill zone... you're clear...""  What does that mean?  Out of the kill zone of the volcano?  That seems pretty stupid if you think about it considering that there is no way that they are out of the kill zone of the volcano.  The only other option would be that Kirk is referring to the ""kill zone"" of the device they are putting in the volcano to stop it.  Well that seems stupid too because, as we see, the device goes off but it does not affect the area surrounding the volcano.  Sooooo... I don't get it.

Also, why does Spock have to lower the device into the volcano?  For the sake of argument, let's say that the eruption and/or magnetic field interferes with transporters.  Ok... then put the device in a torpedo and shoot it into the volcano.  Why do they need Spock to ride down and do it?  Also, this isn't exactly a technical job.  Spock just has to flip some switches on the device.  Does that device appear to be so complicated that only Spock can figure it out?  Why not send down a red-shirted guy to do the job?  For that matter, why not just drop it out the shuttlecraft door and take off?

But what really gets my goat is the location of the Enterprise.  Why is the Enterprise hidden under water?  It is a ""Starship"" right?  What possible reason could there be to hide it under water?  Even Scotty says, ""do you have any idea how ridiculous it is to hide a starship at the bottom of the ocean?""  Actually yes, I do know how ridiculous it is.
Typically, the Enterprise would be in orbit and the shuttlecraft would descend to the planet's surface.  Sooooo... exactly what decision making process generated the conclusion that the best way to hide the Enterprise from the natives was to enter the atmosphere of the planet and drop the ship into the ocean like a giant submarine?  How is that a good idea?  Is there ANY reason why that would be necessary?  ANY?  Never mind the fact that having the Enterprise fly around inside a planet's atmosphere is ridiculous to begin with.  Since when has the Enterprise been capable of entering a planet's atmosphere?  Maybe in the next Star Wars films we will see Imperial Star Destroyers flying around inside a planet's atmosphere as well.  Yeah, that would be stupid... and so is this.

Seriously - stop for just a minute and think about this.  Assuming the Enterprise was in orbit at some point (because that is typically where one would find a starship), what could have possibly lead the crew to the conclusion that taking the ship into the atmosphere and plunging into the ocean was a good idea?  Huh?  What would possibly be gained by that?  Remember the ""Prime Directive?""  How does flying a starship into the atmosphere help hide it from the native population?  Wouldn't that be easier if you stayed in orbit?

Ok fine... so the Enterprise is under the water.  So if you want to make a special effects statement by doing something like that, then do it better.  Recall in the original Star Trek films the majesty of the Enterprise?  How the movies go out of their way to showcase the ship?  Is that what you see here?  When the ship rises out of the ocean, the effects are terrible.  Recall how the Enterprise looked in The Wrath of Khan when it rose up out of the nebula cloud?  How does that compare to the ship rising out of the ocean?  It doesn't.  Instead, we have a bunch of CGI nonsense ... then the view is blocked by a bunch of red trees... then `boom' the ship is flying across the sky toward the volcano.  Maybe I'd forgive the stupidity of having the ship under water if they at least made it look awesome when it came out.  Nope.

However, I must point out what Sulu says prior to the ship rising out of the water to rescue Spock.  Sulu says ""I don't know that we can maintain that kind of altitude.""  What!  What are you talking about?  This is a starship.  What do you mean you can't ""maintain that kind of altitude.""  What kind of altitude are we talking about?  I watched this scene over and over and it makes zero sense.

What about the Prime Directive?  Spock doesn't want Kirk to save him because it would allow the natives to see the ship (again - why under water in the first place?) and violate the Prime Directive.  However, according to Admiral Pike, stopping the volcano also violates the Prime Directive.  Pike tells Kirk ""You were supposed to survey a planet, not alter its destiny.""  So what is Spock concerned about?  He is already violating the Prime Directive.  Is he ok violating it one way but not another?

Whew.... And that was just the first 10 minutes!

Since I had to practically write a book just to review the first 10 minutes, I can't continue that for the rest of the film.  I can, however, highlight some of the other low points:

-Distance transporting - does this make any sense at all?  If this were truly possible, then there would really be no reason for star fleet.  Who needs ships?  Everyone can just transport themselves anywhere.

-And speaking of long distant transporters, why exactly does Khan transport himself to Kronos, the Klingon world?  Why?  To escape the Federation?  Isn't there anywhere else he could go?  If I was Khan I'd transport myself to that new militaristic starship that the Federation built and take it over.  Why doesn't he do that?  Apparently he helped build and/or design the darn thing.

-When the Enterprise arrives near Kronos, why does Kirk announce to Khan that he has arrived and is going to torpedo him unless he surrenders?  I thought the idea was to capture Khan, not give him a heads up you were arriving.  Maybe a sneak attack would be in order?  Well... I take that back... I guess the original idea was to shoot 72 torpedoes at him.

-Is it just me or is the whole idea here to make Khan into Osama bin Laden?

- Super cell phones - when did The Federation invent super-interstellar cell phones?  How exactly is it that Kirk can make a personal call to Scotty half way across the galaxy?

-When Scotty resigns, why is Chekov made head of engineering?  Do they not have a #2 guy?  They have to take a pilot or weapons officer from the bridge and make him head of engineering?

-What are the Klingons doing while the Enterprise sits there?  Can't they detect it?

-Of all the places to hide people, why would Khan put them into torpedoes?  Yeah, I get he was working on weapons.  However, if you are trying to save people I'm thinking sticking them in a loaded torpedo might not be the best choice.

-What exactly does the big, bad Dreadnought starship look like?  The effects are terrible.  You never really get a good look at it.  And why are the space battle effects so awful?  Watch Wrath of Khan and then watch Into Darkness.  Which battle looks better?  Yeah - Wrath of Khan.  Oh... and what is that admiral dude doing while Kirk and Spock figure out how to shoot through space?  Did he take a coffee break or something?

-When Khan and Spock go through logic of surrendering and returning Khan's crew to him, they play a logic game going through step by step.  Ahhhh... wouldn't part of that discussion be whether Spock would remove the bodies and arm the torpedoes?  If Khan was so brilliant, why didn't he think of that?  They are... after all... torpedoes.

-Was the death scene emotional?  Did you really care?  Again, compare to the same scene in Wrath of Khan.  Which is better?

-When Scotty sabotages the Dreadnought ship, where is the rest of the crew?  Recall that when he enters the ship they are bringing what appears to be a full crew on board.  So where is everyone when he is running around? Why does the ship look deserted?

Still, I give the movie 2 stars.

UPDATE 10/14/2016 - Did you note the comment I made about Imperials Star Destroyers above?  Well, I just watched a trailer for Rogue one and saw a Star Destroyer of some sort hovering over a small mountain... in the atmosphere... I'm becoming convinced that I can't think of anything too stupid anymore.  Eventually it will happen.",1381276800,12,8780,4.472819216182048

5292868,4,B009934S5M,"First of all, let me state - for the record - that this review is for THIS PRODUCT, not the film (which I loved).

I don't get many ""limited edition"" or ""deluxe edition"" or ""any edition"" things, but when I saw this, I had to have it. (Fortunately, my wife agreed!) And I love it. It arrived on time and in good condition. It came in a large, Star Trek-themed box that I can't seem to throw away, and the phaser was inter-packaged separately from the Blu-ray case.

The movie itself was an excellent Blu-ray transfer (sound and picture quality - 5 stars), and the phaser looks and feels amazing. It comes with a stand so it can be displayed 'standing up', which is how we have it. The phaser is hefty and solid-feeling, which I was very impressed with. And the front tip spins around to either the 'kill' or 'stun' mode, which I wasn't expecting. (You can see this 'flip' from 'kill' to 'stun' in the scene with Kirk and Benedict Cumberbatch have just arrived on the enemy Starfleet shit and are formulating a plan with Scotty.)

The only -- and I really do mean ONLY -- reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars was because the phaser doesn't have...a trigger. To some, that may seem a petty complaint, but there you have it. I miss the trigger.

But don't let this one niggly complaint dissuade you. If you're a Star Trek fan and like props, this is the edition for you. The phaser isn't some plasticky, schlocky giveaway -- it's a solid, well-built collectible. I have mine prominently displayed so I can see it every day.

5292908,5,B009934S5M,"Being a long time trekkie, I am amazed how easy it was to accept these new actors in their roles.  The characterizations were so perfect.  Also, these two new movies were able to use a new timeline to make any outcome a surprise, yet interweaving the old plots from episodes past....ie Khan.  The special effects are amazing as well.",1381190400,,333,4.610169491525424

Another thing, they are getting carried away with the size of the interiors. The casting is great, especially Spok but get away from the romance crap.

I myself rip the 3D movie with DVDFab and convert it to a very high quality, i do this because my tv won't activate the correct 3D when i try to play from the bluray. The visuals are amazing, the 3d is very deep and looks great when cgi is in the mix.

If you got a nice setup then yes get it",1381190400,,518,3.6576576576576576

Some may balk at the involvement of Khan (Which is apparently not a spoiler since it says his character name on the box), but I thought it was cool.

When viewed where you could relax and watch and listen it was a bit boring and slow despite near non stop action. Maybe too much action and too little internal logic. I still like the new characters in this reborn series but I would like to see the next one not depend so much on the original TV series plot lines.

I guess there was a good reason to have the sound so loud in the theater after all!",1381190400,,558,3.810344827586207
5292924,4,B009934S5M,"I remember the villain's character in the original series and the movie sequels, but this incarnation was vastly different and for those who have seen the originals, interesting, at least.  The crew is back, with slight alterations due to the change in time that took place in movie 1.  Same banter and interaction, same camera jerkiness when the Enterprise is using weapons, and same extreme vagueness as to how warp drive seemingly gets you from point A to point B in less than 90 seconds now.  Scotty takes a bigger and funnier roll (welcomed).

Best Trek ever?  No.  Worth seeing?  Yes.",1381190400,,590,4.782178217821782

The problem is that the DVD is unwatchable. I live in Japan, buy DVDs from the US, and watch them on my computer.
I've never had a problem doing this until now. I can only assume that there is so much copy protection software in the DVD that is unwatchable on anything other than a US DVD player.
Shipping a US DVD player to Japan just to watch one movie is ridiculous, so I now have a useless DVD and will have to wait for up to a year for the Japanese release.

If your going to do a reboot, then you have to tell the story... not just throw them around in special effected action sequences.

5292953,4,B009934S5M,"The movie stands very well on it's own .  The only reservations that I have are the lack of information concerning the eugenics wars that spawned the creation of Kahn and his followers, the ""Family"" connection ( the closeness of Kahn and his followers) that explains the depth and range of his emotions of rage and hatred.  By the time Kahn was reintroduced into the storyline in The Wrath of Kahn, there had been a lot of character development in the tv series that created the Dread at the mention of his name.
I also feel that the closeness depicted between Spock and Jim was rushed for the same reasons.  For those who are not famiar with the entire Star Trek series, I'm sure that this makes the characters feel a little shallow.
I have had the pleasure of watching every episode of the entire Star Trek story over the years.  I'm sure that it caused me to expect more depth from this movie.",1381104000,,896,4.445121951219512

While I am generally fond of the cast, esp Kirk and Spock, the story line/plot was a letdown esp when compared to the first episode of the new series. ""Darkness"" failed to pass two of my tests for really liking a movie: the fidget test and the popcorn test. Firstoff, the movie made me fidget throughout--not a good sign and one that indicates boredom on an intellectual level. Secondly, I found munching on the popcorn much more captivating than trying unsuccessfully to ""get into"" the movie.

But all the writers and everyone involved ought to have known that Captain Pike, with the help of Spock, went to live on Talos IV in the first season.  I am offended that they would have Christopher Pike in this film as if season one never happened.
Furthermore, I am a great fan of Cumberbatch.  I was excited to know he'd been cast in this visual effects spectacle but alas visual effects were more important to the producers than concentration on historic detail and creation of new and vital characters.

I'm a Trekkie, I'm a Star Trek fan so I knew I was going to see it no matter what.  So when he said my name is Khan that blew me away.  My daughter looked at me and said the look on my face was priceless.  Later J.J. Abrams said he was hoping to get a gasp from the audience when Khan identified himself.  Well he got one from me.

I can also say I like all of the new actors playing the younger versions of the characters we love so much.  The movie was exciting and thrilling.  Since receiving my DVD I have looked at it at least 10 times so far.  It's a movie you can watch over and over.",1381104000,,700,3.9078014184397163

5292991,4,B009934S5M,"This movie is a wild ride with a couple of red herrings here and there to throw you off the scent but with enough clues so you can possibly figure out a few of the twists and turns. There were many, many little Easter Eggs of knowing nods to the past iterations of various Star Trek TV series and movies and much like the original series, throws in some parallels with our current events and struggles of how to balance bringing wrong doers to justice without treading on basic human (or non human) rights as the blood-lust of revenge can be our undoing and end up being less justice and more tyranny. Overall I think you would have to say this is probably either the best or 2nd best theatrical release of the series depending on how you feel about the Wrath Of Khan but as great as it is, I still really, really want to see the writing team bring in my favorite character from the original series, Jim Kirk's ""..own personal devil."" as he referred to him, his Star Fleet Academy nemesis, Finnegan, the Irish upperclassman who tortured a young ""plebe' Kirk in the original timeline.  Watching someone get under Kirk's skin would be fun to watch and good comic relief but when his inevitable comeuppance is doled out it could also be a good way to bring in the current topic of bullying, cyber and otherwise.",1381104000,,1308,4.472803347280335

The phaser was a little disappointing. I already have the previous version which I feel has a better finish. The only difference besides the slight color variance is this version has the ability to change from ""stun"" to ""kill"" but there is no button to engage the mechanism. You have to rotate it manually. Once changed the mechanism will stay firmly in place but the ""stun"" side slightly hits the bottom of the rotation area and caused a slight scratch in mine when I rotated it. My phaser also arrived with other minor scratches in the finish. That was disappointing considdering that my original version arrived in perfect condition. Having said all that, the sculpt is excellent! It's movie accurate and has a good weight to it thanks to its metal finishes. It makes and excellent piece for any sci-fi display.

For example being able to teleport to the Klingon planet and the fact that we now have super blood that brings people back from death. These two things pretty much change history, but they are overlooked in the show like ""Hey, it's a fun movie if you don't think about it or realize the history of the show or what these two things mean for the future.""

Another thing I don't like is the over acting. I mean way over acting. Much of the cast is like an exagerated version of the origional people. Benedict did an amazing job though I should say.

The movie is not really true to the series ... The series is very nerdy and it's important to the series to try and be accurate. The whole show is about understanding and exploring. This movie was was about gun fights and explosions.

In fact muting the sound, putting on a great piece of music and just watching this as a visual experience is the way to go. Otherwise skip it.
This film is a perfect example of the degree to which every aspect of film making sets, FX, performances are far outdistancing the s***ty scripts being delivered.  Very strange.",1381017600,15,622,4.980769230769231

5293009,2,B009934S5M,"I so wanted to like this movie, I really did.  I enjoyed the previous movie showing the young Kirk and crew.  But this was disappointing.  I'm not a Trekkie purist protecting Star Trek canon, but I saw no real purpose in messing with the previous story lines.  The premise from the previous ""young Kirk"" movie was that the sequence of time was violated--which opens the door for huge leaps of creative license.  Still looking for the creative, though.  Nothing original, just pieces of the original series and movies thrown together and then pureed.

(Spoiler alert)

FX:  lots of things blowing up and running gun fights, so if you like pyrotechnics, there's plenty for you.

Khan:  Yes, he's back--again!  So in this movie, long before the original series crew finds Richardo Montalban and his crew floating through space in ""Space Seed,"" Admiral Marcus found them first and used Khan to build Weapons of mass destruction.  Classically-trained Cumberbatch (young Sherlock Holmes) doesn't play the role with the passion Montalban did.  He's the brooding intellectual for the most part except when he squeezes peoples' heads, then he looks quite maniacal.  In the end, Khan is put back into cryogenic suspension along with his crew (which were never seen in this movie). But you can be sure we'll see Khan back again and again.

Klingons:  After violating the Prime Directive, Kirk is now seen as a irresponsible maverick blindly violating rules; thus the perfect patsy to deliver the WMD's to Chronos and spark a war with the Klingons.  Yet, they are only a cameo at the beginning of the movie and not seen again despite the fact that Star fleet has violated the neutral zone resulting in the killing of a Klingon squad.

Tribbles:  In another juxtaposition with the Original series, Dr. McCoy already has a tribble long before they supposedly first encounter them in ""the Trouble with Tribbles.""  No explanation of why tribbles are now in the past.  No real reason for their inclusion other than to be a petrie dish for Khan's blood.

Christopher Pike:  The pilot for the original series had Capt. Pike as the lead, but it didn't sell.  When the series was revamped with Kirk in the lead, they recycled the pilot film into ""The Menagerie.""  Pike, who was badly mutilated and wheelchair bound, finds life again as a young man in the illusionary world of Talos IV.  Now let's erase that Spock was First Officer to Pike for 11 years aboard the Enterprise and that Kirk was introduced to Pike for the fist time in that episode.  So, ok, Pike is now Kirk's surrogate father figure and the one that convinced him to join Star Fleet.  Fine.  But in this movie, Pike is killed off right at the beginning.  Why?  To utilize the timeworn vehicle of a slain loved one as Kirk's motivation for anger and revenge.

Carol Marcus:  In ""Wrath of Khan,"" this was Kirk's past flame and mother of his son.  This movie inserts the character into Kirk's youth before they become lovers and before he does whatever he does that caused she and the son to hate him.  The sparks between the two provided a promising subtext to the movie.  Except that she's a weapons expert in this one and becomes a terraform expert later--probably goes back to school for another doctorate.

Kirk:  Last, but not least.  The previous movie asked you to swallow that Kirk as a cadet fresh from the academy is made captain of the Enterprise.  Fine, it was an emergency, no one else could do it, field promotion in wartime and all that.  Suspend judgement because this movie establishes the captaincy as permanent, eliminating all those pesky years of earning his way up the ranks and all the references in the previous series and movies alluding to those past lessons learned.  Here's the difference--Kirk as a seasoned captain could pull off those seat-of-the-pants escapades because he had a command presence and seemed to know what he was doing.  In this movie, Kirk is just brash and willful with no substance to back it up.  Therefore, the underlying storyline is Kirk's maturation process which Spock aids him in.  Loss, death, self-sacrifice, fear, humility; Kirk has a lot to learn.

In a replay of the touching scene at the end of ""Wrath of Khan"" where Spock dies from radiation with Kirk on the other side of the glass, the two are juxtaposed and Kirk dies from radiation and self-sacifice.  Yes, KIRK DIES.  Too bad they didn't end it there.  McCoy, transfuses Khan's miraculous blood into Kirk's fresh corpse and he lives yet again.

Rent the movie, it's worth a couple bucks.  But it helps if you know very little about Star Trek--or anything else for that matter!",1381017600,3,4637,4.775818639798489

But the concept of this new timeline opens the door to endless storylines and the fact that they played off one of the truly great original episodes is no surprise.  While just having a new Star Trek movie brings smiles to my face...I do share some disgust with others who have written reviews about the sets used and also believe that they need to get rid of J.J. Abrahms, I was half expecting to see an Alien from the Alien movies pop up out of the engineering section which resembles a milk processing plant or something on that order.  Please, the Next Generation had better sets and this is a major motion picture.  I understand the timeline is earlier than TNG, but even the TV show Enterprise had sets more inline with Trekkie fare.  I blame Abrahms, it's his show, get rid of him and get someone who is a true trekkie to make the next Star Trek movie.  There are generations of people watching.  Generations who grew up in the era of the US space program, that made young kids dream of who things that could be in the future.  The original Star Trek was a dream that shaped people's viewpoints, explored space but also skated the edge of social or moral sensibilities, we need another Roddenberry.",1381017600,,1438,4.482758620689655

The answer is no.  If you have a LED monitor it will not play 3D.  Loved the movie.  This is better than the first they came out with.

The original was a different generation. Those guys weren't really athletes and didn't have the same demands for action scenes. Fitness and exercise has evolved since then. In terms of action in older movies they are hard to watch because they lack it. I love the original. I grew up watching the reruns as a kid...regarding the reboot I wish they had picked a curvy actress that actually looks more like Nichele Nichols. Zoe isn't bad just too skinny, and when conmpared to Nichele....well there isn't a comparison.

5293050,5,B009934S5M,"I have always liked Star Trek ever since first having seen the original series on TV way back when I was a kid. So, when J.J. Abrams made the first Star Trek reboot movie in 2009, I had some mixed feelings about it all. I thought that the movie could have been a lot better than it was, and that it should have also been something completely new and refreshing instead of playing around with already known and well-established characters as it did, but, at the same time, I had to admit that it was a much better movie than it's predecessor, Nemesis was. After a few more viewings though, the 2009 Star Trek really began to grow on me.

Having said all of that, I really enjoyed Star Trek: Into Darkness and actually think that it is one of the best Star Trek movies ever made. I now look forward to seeing a third one in the series and I hope that all of the current original cast members return for at least one more adventure, and I also hope that it won't be as long of a wait as it was between the 2009 Star Trek and Into Darkness was.",1380931200,2,1040,4.148514851485149

5293073,2,B009934S5M,"""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is the sequel to JJ Abrams awful 2009 revision of the hoary sci-fi series.  Though the weaknesses of the first film remain, there are enough redemptive features here to bear watching.

  Though the choices for the Kirk and Spock leads remain poor - Chris Pine is a clown, Zachary Quinto is unlikable and unbelievable as an intellectual and the Spock/Uhura neurotic romance angle remains  - new additions to the cast improve things quite a bit: Benedict Cumberbatch - fresh from his popular portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in an equally crass bastardization of that genre - and ol' Robocop Peter Weller add a great deal of gravitas to the sequel.  Cumberbatch has a grand time twisting his narrow features into all kinds of sinister contortions, using his resonant British voice powerfully.  No attempt is made to explain why the Indian Khan Noonian Singh is now a pasty faced Brit.  Weller is a wonder, giving his militaristic Starfleet admiral the perfect air of menacing arrogance.

  One amusing manufactured controversy involves a glimpse of young Carol Marcus in her underwear.  The self-righteous were ""shocked, shocked"" that Hollywood would dare to show an attractive woman in flimsy clothing.  The screenwriter even issued a ""mea culpa"" to the easily offended.  No one admitted that this has been going on - usually in longer shots - since moving pictures began.

  The second Abrams trek continues to boast production values denied the franchise during the years when it was well-written.  Viewers can ooh and ahh over a giant black Federation starship that menaces the Enterprise.  Interior sets have been upgraded since the last film too.  Though they remain pink and white with annoying lens flares, the sets include scenes shot at Lawrence Livermore Labs.  This marginally mitigates the mistake of shooting a Budweiser distillery as Engineering.

  The biggest problem remains the script.  Whereas in Abrams' ""Star Trek"" the main characters repeated their old signature lines ad infinitem (""I'm a doctor, not a ____""), the sequel repeats variations on entire scenes from popular predecessors.  The cynicism of that recycling effort is all too evident.  Abrams even repeats himself; if the Enterprise rises above a cloud layer in his first film, why not a second?  The vessel also pulls extra duty as a part-time submarine (!) here.

  Now that the sequel has made far more money than its worthier predecessors, its director can go on to ruining Star Wars.  Baz Luhrman anyone?",1380931200,2,2513,5.098280098280099

5293110,1,B009934S5M,"Review of 3D - With my system, the 3D Blu-Ray player and TV will not zoom to full screen.  (This is my first 3D purchase.)  If you watch at less than the recommended 12 feet, the 3D looks like paper layers in a 3D book.  My room is too small to watch at that distance. If I go into the hallway, I can see the 3D better but then I also have to wear my glasses under my 3D glasses to watch it since it is reduced to about 16"" high on my 46"" screen. My old 1979 26"" Sony tube TV is almost that high! Recommend that unless you have a very large set, a large room and good vision that you stay away from this 3D disc.....(or only buy if you like wearing eye glasses under the 3D glasses and you have a large room).

I have no problem watching 3D in the theater but because of the height loss and due to the default unswitchable theater screen dynamic (meaning 16:9), the figures are too small and look blurred.... What a waste of money!  Personally, I despise systems which will not let you change the default.  What idiot engineers thought that they knew better than the customer?

Benedict Cumberpatch does an incredible job revisiting the classic character of Khan.  While it is interesting that he's gone from an Indian Sikh to an Englishman without explanation, the gravitas of Cumberpatch's performance quickly allows you to forget it.  In this film, Kirk gains new insight into what it means to be captain, and for the first time really faces death, but with a new twist.

5293131,5,B009934S5M,"Many other reviews correctly tell about the way the extras are split between different retailers.  This is a big deal if you are into the extras on a movie, also be aware that I too find it frustrating.  I decided to buy the movie on demand - none of the extras are included, just like all that are on demand.  The problem I have with the other reviews is that some of them have forgotten about the movie.

This is the second release of the latest ""New"" (at this point that seems redundant) Star Trek series of movies.  The interaction and personality's are more established and work together more like they should and the story ties in new names and persons from the old (future) star trek shows.

The show is full of special effects (like all si-fi movies), but they tend to be used to help the story as opposed to being an end to itself.  The story and the plot is good and the director duos not need to lean on effects as much.

I don't rehash the story when I review.  I will say that this movie is enjoyable for those both old and new to star trek and that if you know some of the old shows there are some nice surprises in store.

There you go - If you get hooked up on if this or that retailer has this or that extra, you may miss a good movie.  Just download it on demand and enjoy it and keep the extra bucks for pop-corn.",1380758400,,1332,4.104247104247104

5293145,4,B009934S5M,"I purchased a streamed HD rental of this 2nd installment of the reboot/prequel of the original Star Trek franchise.  From Amazon to my 60"" plasma.  It's not bad plot-wise if (like most sci-fi movies) you are willing to ignore a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies.  Chris Pine's acting has improved somewhat.  SPOILER ALERT - DO NOT READ FURTHER IF HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW:  The tension of the scene where he is confronted by Peter Weller (ship to ship) is probably the best acted scene in the movie.  It's well written as Pine/Kirk parries the Admirals authority and steps cagily and confidently while holding his ground when the chips are down.  Scotty, McCoy and Uhuru seem more comfortable and developed in their roles.  My complaint is that the writers had to go back and mine the Khan from the old franchise.  Cumberbatch is a good villain smart, intense, edgy.  I'm just worried what the franchise will do for the next installment if they get into a habit of not writing new stuff.  Also, how did Khan (Cumberbatch) survive 72 torpedoes going off on that ship?  For that matter, how did the ship itself survive intact with all those explosions?  72 torpedoes onboard?  Oh yeah, that's right I'm not supposed to think about that.  The Carol Marcus backstory gets fitted into this episode. Supposedly some critics have complained about CGI on this film.  I don't have any problem with the quality of it's CGI rendering on this film.  It looks no more or less convincing  than a zillion other high budget sci-fi movies.  In closing, decent entertainment for a couple hours.  It was worth the 4.99 HD streaming rental.  I feel no need to purchase the Blu-Ray though.  4 stars.",1380672000,,1679,4.737024221453288

Ummm... that guy is supposed to fill the shoes of Ricardo Montiban?  They nailed it with Spock and Kirk, A- for Bones. I give them B+ for Chechov, uhura, Sulu and Mr. Scott.

I mean the had a lot of AMAZING talent and a cool plot if they stuck with the ""non-Khan"" aspect.  i love the franchise and I hope they will keep at it for many sequels but they really have to create more new material or else be more committed to the original details.

In this series Kirk and Spock have not been together long enough to develop the friend ship that made the loss of one so devastating in the original. Three D is good and overall the acting and chemistry between the characters is very good. The phaser is pretty cool, with a good weight but the revolving fire chamber is just cheap painted plastic.

With the exception of the minor ""chuffing"" from my Polk Audio PSW-505 subwoofer that struggled to match the 30 hertz lows that the sound fields emitted. I will be purchasing a second subwoofer to counter this minor discrepancy. J.J. Abrams needs to kinda go back & view the past installments of the Star Trek movies in order to get a better grasp on what these movies were all about before he decides to take on another Star Trek film.

One miracle of our humanity is our ability to suspend disbelief, which allows us to enter into and feel magical worlds, whether through told tales, books, television or movies.  Although not a die-hard Trekkie, I have followed the series all my life, through its many incarnations (OK, I deep-sixed Deep Space), but this latest movie seemed to make a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation.  I don't think that he would appreciate the caricatures that have been made of Kirk, Spock, & the crew.  Star Trek was never meant to be a comedy in space.

The actors have successfully channeled their characters from the originals with just slight change to make them their own. The known trek universe has changed a lot, but is still recognizable to us older fans. There is a good balance between the action and technology and good, old fashioned story telling and characterization. I am so anxious to see where it goes to next, now that the 5 year mission is underway. I am hoping that this time, Abrams will get it right and NOT kill off Kirk's son, David, who has so much potential to add to the show mix.
I recommend this to any and all Trek fans past and present. My 2 granddaughters, 6 and 8 watched this the whole way through with interest, so any new, young fans to be should watch it, too.

5293223,3,B009934S5M,"It takes more than a handsome cast of studs to make a good Star Trek feature film. I was gaga over the first one even if it included a big dud of a villain in Nero. This new one, inexplicably titled ""Into Darkness,"" moves to re-establish the trinity of Kirk/Spock/Bones as Kirk/Spock/Uhura. And that's the good news! Look, Nichelle Nichols was an inspiration to me and one of the main reasons I pursued a career in the entertainment industry (I did fine, but I did grow tired of the rampant drug abuse that permeates that field). As much as Uhura was a ""force"" to be reckoned with, using her femme charms in part V ""The Final Frontier"" to devastating effect, these new movies have transformed Uhura into a powerhouse. I love the scene in ""Into Darkness"" where she stands her ground while confronting a demonic Klingon warrior. Oh but they paired her as a subservient girlfriend to Mr. Logic himself, Spock. Even Sybok would likely have found her too headstrong, haha!

I wish they had done something other than essentially remake The Wrath of Khan, but what else is new? I will buck the current trend among femmes my age (or shall I say ""vintage""? *wink*) and say that I do not understand the fuss over Benedict Cumberbatch. Great name, blank-slate screen presence. He's playing, well John Harrison (hardy-har-har), and may I simply say I have never seen a bigger turkey in the role of ""villain"" throughout all Trek movies. In fact, I found myself longing for Eric Bana to show up as Nero and put this wuss in his place!

5293229,4,B009934S5M,"So, here is the second installment of the ""rebooted"" Star Trek series, again directed by J.J. Abrams. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a big-budget action-packed adventure movie that is so fast-paced that you almost forget the storyline is full of plot holes. After all, this is a J.J. Abrams movie and how he re-imagined the universe of ""Star Trek,"" for better or worse. It was sort of refreshing in his previous effort back in 2009, with a new cast of players and Leonard Nimoy returning to the series, but this time the filmmakers went too far.

Following the pre-main title action sequence (in a James Bond fashion, the main story begins as Chris Pine's Captain Kirk sets out to capture one John Harrison, a terrorist responsible for the bomb attack in London, now hiding in the Klingon home world.

Whether or not you are an avid Star Trek fan, you will soon realize that this is a Hollywood-made sci-fi blockbuster action movie whose name happens to be ""Star Trek,"" in spite of the third act that has something to do with one ""Star Trek"" episode in the past.

Among the film's cast including those who have returned to play the ""Enterprise"" crew, it is Benedict ""Sherlock"" Cumberbatch who leaves the most lasting impression as ""John Harrison."" Of course he is not what he seems. Great as his performance is, however, the back story of Cumberbatch's character does not really convince.

The film is a fun ride, to be sure, but not as much fun as the previous one. Slick and entertaining as it is, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" looks more like an average sci-fi adventure movie that tries too hard to be ""Star Trek.""",1380499200,2,1612,4.665492957746479

Sorry, there are just some moments from the original series that shouldn't be messed with and that's one of them. If you're going to retell the Kahn story, then really retell it.

Second, the fact that Kahn (and the ship) survived the explosion of not one or two but 72 photon torpedoes so that he could crash into Starfleet Headquarters, which he also survived, was too much. It was like Karl getting hung by the neck by a chain on the roof right before it blew up in Die Hard yet still somehow showing up on the street to shoot John.

Of course, I'm not the target audience, (brain-dead adolescents and zombie-like twenty-somethings) but STILL . . . the characters are cartoon versions of the originals, especially the puerile, celluloid-lipped Justin Bieber version of Kirk, who, let's face it, in the ORIGINAL version was nothing more than pure beefcake.  So, if low-budget male stripper-type was the goal, it was more than achieved.  The Spock character?  Just plain STUPID and ANNOYING, utterly lacking in any intellectual gifts (rather surprising,in a Vulcan) but--grotesquelyenough--amorous around  . . . Uhura.  Again, if stupid and annoying was the goal for this character:  wow, perfect success.

McCoy, merely predictably dull, with lines indifferently culled from . . . morning meetings of some of the older staff of the this movie?  UHURA:  transformed from dignified African Queeen to hysterical cheerleader:  Hmmm, not good.  Ditto on Checkov:  how much hysteria can one actor produce?  Only Scotty seemed halfway close to the original, and that's because he WASN'T IN THE MOVIE for a good portion of it.  The Star Fleet uniforms are awfully reminiscent of the first Star Wars, except for the caps, which are straight out of present day North Korea.  UGH.  It doesn't get much uglier than that.  The plot has been done . . . oh, heavens who knows how many times before, but certainly Spock died in the old warp core on at least one other occasion.  Who the hell HASN'T died in the warp core  The love interest:  beyond tedious and predictable. Sigh.  The one bright spot:  Cumberbatch as the bad guy.  He was . . . . . almost interesting.

5293258,3,B009934S5M,"I have a love hate relationship with the new Star Trek movies. Being a huge fan of the original Star Trek movies, I can tell that this movie is a rewrite of Star Trek: The Wrath of Kahn. This is why I only give it 3 stars. Whoever wrote the script should have come up with something more original instead of ""borrowing"" from Roddenberry's original idea. Using an updated version of the original tv musical score at the end of the movie does not influence my opinion that this movie was a rip-off of the original ST: TWOK movie. Role reversals and hop scotching enemies from Kahn to Marcus to Kahn was just silly.

In spite of being a rip-off, this movie has plenty of content to stand apart from the original. The only way this was accomplished, was having the Leonard Nemoy cameo as Spock to remind viewers that this is a different timeline from the original movies. Kirk's actions and punishment in the beginning of the movie were mind blowing, but set the stage for the rest of the movie. The introduction of the Dreadnought class of starship was incredibly cool, as they never existed in the originals. Wished there had been more about it, and that Scotty had brought some of the specs of that ship to the relaunched Enterprise at the end of the movie.

Other than that, the rest of the movie is a rip-off of the original. Spock becomes the hero instead of Kirk?!?! Marcus was more of an enemy than Kahn?!?! Glorifying an actor's sexual preference seems to be hollywood's agenda nowadays, but irregardless, this rewrite isn't as good as the original even with this preferential treatment.

 I think in the sequel to this movie the writers need to stop borrowing from the originals, and be a little more creative. If you cannot come up with something more original, stop writing.",1380499200,,1782,4.59433962264151

The story line was bad so I think the actors did the best with what was given them. If we are recreating a series then do it just like you did the first film in this line. Borrowing from the old Star Trek is a bad idea because none of today's actors or director are capable of achieving that highest level of performance established by the old crews. I pre-ordered this thing on Blue Ray and immediately handed it to my son as a gift after viewing it the first and probably last time for me. The CGI is way over done probably to compensate for the poor script and mediocre acting.

I found this movie to be a slap in the face of the cast, crew and fans of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. It is geared toward the teen aged market that cannot imagine anything past the video game console in their bedroom.

An older latin man to be used in genetic experiments in present times to make a super soldier in America is more plausible than using a skinny English white guy.  I think the obvious choice for the role would have been Antonio Banderas, He is Latin, older, a better actor, that kind of thing.

I gave 4 stars not 5 b/c the story didn't blow my mind so the movie could have been better, but it was still pretty good and had some fun surprises (without giving too much away, I liked that the story was a weird/warped version of another famous Star Trek plot that unfolded differently in the new, alternate timeline).

I initially questioned the choice of the alternate timeline setting for these new movies since so much remains in the original universe, e.g. the period between Enterprise and TOS or TOS and TNG, but I see now that it's mainly a vehicle to allow for re-imagining the star trek universe including the characters and races, which if done creatively which I believe so far it has been, is in fact a very good thing.  I really want to see more of the 'new' Klingons!  Also, I'm not sure if it was in the last movie, but I love the way the warp drive is re-imagined, much more realistic, it looks like a particle accelerator meets National Ignition Facility.

The actor doing Khan is terrible and horribly over acts every scene.  There is a lot of completely mindless action that really does nothing for the show.  The fifteen minutes spent flying through space, swerving around debris to get Kirk and Khan to the enemy ship is just stupid.  But worse than that, there are changes to the entire idea of Star Trek and how it was supposed to be about a better humanity that Abrams has essentially destroyed.  The future suddenly looks and feels - bleak.  And what was the thinking behind changes to the Klingons?  They look fake and just ridiculous.  Then we have plot lines which Abrams stole from the pages of Star Trek II (how we got there, chronologically, when the events of early Khan encounter haven't happened seems a stretch) - but trying to steal the emotional charge of the Spock dying scene just seemed contrived and had no impact whatsoever.

As a Star Trek fan, I'm appalled at this latest feature.  It destroys the last vestiges of a noble Star Trek.

5293287,5,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness accomplished what I didn't think was possible: to re-engage, to to speak, a very respectable movie franchise to even greater heights than any of it's predecessors.  That is no small feat, but Abrams has managed it with a thoroughly engaging story and plot, and a cast of outstanding young actors.  The CG effects and everything else are, of course, first rate as well, something you would naturally expect from an Abrams film.  All of the younger actors channel their older counterparts with an amazing amount of authenticity.  It was a lot of fun watching them as they adopted the accents and mannerisms of the old guard with such skill.  Zachary Quinto's voice could have perhaps been lowered considerably to match the tonal properties of the original Spock/Nemoy, but this is just one of a few minor quibbles.  Beside,doing so would have probably come across as phony and inauthentic in any event.

Karl Urban does a wonderful early version of the irascible Bones.  Urban is, in my opinion, a very interesting and talented young character actor who reminds me a lot of Gary Oldman or Dustin Hoffman in their ability to transform themselves so thoroughly like human chameleons). Another incredibly talented actor in this piece is Benedict Cumberbach as the evil Pike.  I first noticed Cumberbach as the modern day version of Sherlock Holmes in the unfortunately short-lived series of that same name.  He was, in my opinion, the best flim version of Sherlock Holmes I have ever seen.  FYI:  I am a HUGE Conan Doyle fan and am thoroughly acquainted with the behavior and mannerisms of Doyle's Holmes and Cumberbach managed to absolutely nail Holme's personality down in a way that no other actor has.

Star Trek into Darkness has been thoroughly reviewed by others far more capable than myself, but I will only say that it is a must see for any serious sci-fi fan, such as myself. As I've said, it is, in my opinion, among the best, if not the best of the entire Star Trek franchise to date.

So that made it even worse when I received my pre-release package that was stuffed with all sorts of disk options (Bluray, DVD, 3D). I popped my Bluray disk into the player and immediately went to Special Features since, of course, I'd seen the film multiple times already and what I really wanted was the story behind the story. And since there were SO many disks there had to be SO many features, right?

So what I really wanted was commentary. Not there. (What? No commentary!!!???) What I really wanted was a gag reel. Nope. What I really wanted were more interviews with cast members. Nah, not there either.

Didn't get any of that. Were all the typical features hidden as Easter Eggs? Were they on here but I couldn't find them?

It wasn't until I read other reviews that I realized what was going on. I wasn't imagining things. If movie studios are going to make consumers figure out which release and which disk and which vendor and which feature package to buy before buying (which is *really* hard to do in a pre-order situation because you don't get all the details), serves them right if sales fall -- and they should.

So, don't buy this disk, especially if you've already seen the film and what you really want is the story behind the story. 'Cuz you won't get it. Wish I could say where else to buy but it's too confusing. Check the other reviews; some of them have done a great job at explaining what's where.

5293303,3,B009934S5M,I love all the Star Trek movies new and old. This one I did not like. It felt worn out. It was forced. Was not up to the standards of the other Star Trek movies. Lucky to get 3 stars. I don't want to bring Star Trek ratings down.,1380412800,,229,3.693877551020408

5293309,2,B009934S5M,"The best I can say is that the visual effects were stunning but they relied too much on that. I have watched all the Star Trek series and have seen all the movies starting with the original series back in the sixties so I feel I can make a valid comparison. The best I can say is that the current individuals in charge of doing Star Trek have lost the vision in both this movie and it's predecessor. The best they could do was a couple of cheap knock offs of the original series and then they changed the story lines in illogical ways.

All I can say to the current producers and directors is that Star Trek is not a video game. Come on guys, you can do better!",1380412800,2,661,4.084615384615384

5293312,3,B009934S5M,"Acting was good. Always get a hoot out of the hyper-sexed Captain Kirk: the guy is always on the lookout; it's a wonder he doesn't have 20 babies by now. Regarding the story, it was okay.  I'm a Star Trek fan from way back, and the actors who play the roles presently are all competent actors. In this story, director/writer, whoever, seemed to be trying to age some of the leads by giving them older hair styles. I know Bones is a complainer but totally unbelievable that he'd what, volunteer to go along with Captain Kirk in the opening sequence, just to complain, complain, complain while they're running for their lives. Just don't think a guy would behave that way, even though the old television character was somewhat like that; would've been nice to keep a touch of that but have him make sense, in other words not have him complain for the sake of complaining. Also, have no idea why Ohura and Spock have hooked up, absolutely no chemistry. I'm a big Spock fan and I have no idea why the actress playing Ohura would fancy him, no idea whatsoever, and this is coming from someone who likes Spock. Didn't like the villain, thought he was too hammy in a few of the scenes, but in others he was okay. I hate to knock actors so I'll put his choices down to insufficient directorial guidance. That's about it.  Look forward to future movies. Not a disaster; could've been worse.",1380326400,,1381,4.52

5293316,5,B009934S5M,Thought the movie held to the original and still delivered modern movie magic. If it seemed a little far-fetched to you then don't go to see sci-fi movies about traveling through space.,1380326400,,185,4.8125

5293320,2,B009934S5M,Any Star Trek fan will like this movie as pure entertainment.  As long as you don't sweat the little things.  Any reboot of a classic can be nit-picked to death.  It was more of the sale of this movie that I found alittle off.  I always thought pre-ordering something would give you a break on the buy.  Whelp...not in this case.  Could have gone to anyone of the local big box stores and pick this movie up sooner than I received it.  AND...for $5 bux cheaper.  Oh well...it happens.,1380326400,,484,4.359550561797753
5293321,4,B009934S5M,The actor who played Khan(sp?) stole the show. With him the movie has a depth of emotion beyond the action. Well worth the price of admission.,1380326400,2,142,4.5

5293330,5,B009934S5M,I really like these newer Star Trek movies. They picked a great cast. For the villain in this one they pick none other then Benedict Cumberbatch. He is cast as Sherlock Holmes in the British show Sherlock. Great actor. This one won me over. I saw it in the theater and had to buy it. Get it! You will enjoy it.,1380240000,3,310,4.098360655737705

This episode should have had elder Spock coaching the younger Spock how to sling-shot around the sun to go back in time. They then could have set time back to correct what the Romulans screwed-up, saved Romulus, Vulcan and all the people destroyed including Kirk's father and Spock's mother. Too bad the visionaries didn't see this. But as the old saying goes, they called off the clairvoyant society's annual meeting due to unforeseen circumstances!",1380240000,2,592,4.813725490196078

The characters in this new series are edgy, and intense, making it what I believe to be the closest in similarity to the original series. The new Kirk has the same cockiness as the original; the new Spock is over the top logical, as was Leonard Nimoy.

The similarities to the original cast members is almost eerie. From Scotty and Uhura, Bones, and Checkov, the casting was spot on. I've been watching Star Trek for over 45 years, and I'll keep watching as long as they keep making them.",1380240000,2,625,4.530973451327434

5293340,1,B009934S5M,"This was such a disappointment on many levels. first,i will say that in the reboot movie captain kirk had seemingly grown.in this movie he is portrayed as a punkish rebel to start the movie instead of the original idea that captain kirk was a brash, bold, innovative leader who thought outside the box. He was the counter balance to the bureaucratic mindset of starfleet, not some punk commander. The second problem i have is that so many components of the movie were ripped from the wrath of khan. but unlike khan, there is no history between kirk and khan, which really dilutes the psychological edge of the movie. third,the budget and goal of the movie. when i saw the budget of the movie i knew it was gonna be problematic. jj abrahms sold the franchise(as well as paramount) for pop culture suckiness instead of sticking to the intent of the franchise. while i can understand some changes with the roboot,some of the differences are inforgivable. like the design of the enterprise.in the original series the enterprise was designed like a tank or battleship and in the reboot its designed like a ferrari or yatch. its little details like that that ruin both the reboot and the second movie.and in this movie there are lots of little details like that that ruin the star trek experience and turn it into pop culture crapiness.",1380240000,18,1330,4.737068965517241

5293345,3,B009934S5M,"The story line for the new Star Trek travels back to a time where we meet the character Khan seemingly for the first time. Khan, of course, was the character played by Ricardo Montalban in the tv episode and in the movie ""Wrath of Khan."" It's an interesting development and apparently the writers have implied this occurs on a separate time/space continuum since the young Spock confers with the older Spock about how to deal with Khan. My own feeling is there should be completely new adversaries developed for the Enterprise crew to deal with. As far as action and special effects, this movie lives up to the previous movies, but it is fairly predictable.",1380240000,2,657,4.721739130434782

5293385,4,B009934S5M,"Some background: I first started watching Star Trek back when ""The Next Generation"" premiered - and fell for the amazing stories.  I liked the special effects, marveled at how frequently they would sneak something controversial by the censors, but most of all I loved by the IDEA of ""Star Trek"".  If you are a fan of the show, you know exactly what I mean.

Since then, I have watched and enjoyed every other incarnation of Trek.  Even Voyager and Enterprise.

So...did the JJ reboot in 2009 bother me? Not really.  I realized it for what it was - a studio trying to 'reboot' a franchise to make it appeal to a new generation of movie buffs - the ones who grew up with iPad's in their hands and televisions in every room.  The ones who openly...deride...Shatner's...signature...delivery...of his lines.

This movie is a fun, action packed romp from beginning to end.  It takes the normally upstanding Starfleet and turns it on its head - showing it as an organization that is corrupt, decedent and prone to the human failings that are familiar to audiences in 2013.

If you are looking for a cerebral story, go elsewhere.

If you like beautiful women, explosions, lens flare, and action, check this out.

My other thoughts:

- Spock stealing the ""KHAAAAAAN!!"" line seemed very forced, but I cackled with glee anyway.  Admit it -- you did too.

- Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan steals the show.

- Alice Eve is GORGEOUS.

- Kirk really should not be running a ship.  The Enterprise seems to almost get destroyed every 15 minutes.

Check this out, you will not regret it...if you come into this with an open mind.",1380067200,,1609,4.682142857142857

5293390,2,B009934S5M,"I know that I have a minority opinion, but I think Abrams' story telling is poor.  He seems so bent on action sequences, while passing on a weak script.  For example, the action sequence of Mr. Evil's (sorry, uh, ""Khan's"") attack on the emergency meeting of Star Fleet elites is just dumb.  Why have a high-level strategic meeting in a plain ol highrise with nice big windows... the better for Mr. Evil to kill you all... with his ultra killing helicopter?

Then there are a lot of wink-and-nod references to TOS, but no respect for the legacy.  Why completely change the Khan character, so well exploited in the 2nd movie?  With all the possible directions to go, why lazily pick out this character again and ""re-imagine"" it?  And recycling the Khhaaaaan! yell and the self-sacrifice thing, to me, just turns them into too much self-aware smirking.

Look at the better movies (ST 2 and ST 6).  Characters (by Ricardo Montelban and Christopher Plummer) were well developed, given clear motivations, and great lines.  You liked them in some ways, a great way to magnify their menace.

I'm likely showing my age, but expect more than action sequences and illogical plot points.  The novelty of computer graphics is gone, as should be the awe of hyperkinetic animation. I wish younger viewers would be more demanding of productions that cost $200 million dollars and bigger profits. And listening to Mr. Abram's self congratulatory comments about the his ""Mystery Box""(TM) approach to filming is just too much.  It's easy to get big heads in our society.

Oh, one last thing. Yes, I like most of the new ST characters quite a bit.  However, taking Kirk even further down the swaggering path is, to my taste, too much.  His apple-eating ways and smarty-pants behavior on the bridge just doesn't fit as a leader in a quasi-military outfit. He needs some basic training on decorum and leadership.  Too much ""cool"" (or sloppyness) for my likes.",1380067200,9,1937,4.838905775075988

5293394,4,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness shows us once again why J.J. Abrahams was perfect to direct Star Trek.  If he brings the same level of quality to the new Star Wars films, then both Star Trek and Star Wars fans are in for a treat for the next several years.  Into Darkness was a great and thrilling film like the 2009 Star Trek film was.  I, personally, like the first film a little better for one reason, which I will get to.  However this is still an experience you must see in the theater.

The characters are the same from the first movie with a couple new additions.  The crew of the enterprise is still very fun to watch and work off of each other brilliantly.  Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto still do great as Kirk and Spock.  I love the development and growth that this movie gave to both characters.  Kirk comes to realize that there are consequences of his rash actions.  Kirk seems much more like a captain in this film.  He is still a bit reckless and hot-headed, but he comes off as much more mature than the last film, which I think is nice.  Spock finds himself conflicted with following protocol and being human.

I really like how both character arcs are presented and how they are resolved.
The rest of the actors give fantastic performances as well.  We are introduced to a new crew member, Carol Marcus, played by Alice Eve.  She does a good job.  I do not mind her.

The villain, however, I have some issue with.  Benedict Cumberbatch as Kon did not do it for me.  He is not bad, and I know he had big shoes to fill.  However, compared to Ricardo Montalban as Kon, Benedict just falls short, in my opinion.  He is the reason why I do not like this film as much as the 2009 film.

The effects look gorgeous.  They are every bit as eye-pleasing as the first film, if not more so.  I cannot comment on the 3D, since my theater does not show movies in 3D.  The action is awesome and intense.

Overall, this is a must see for those who loved the 2009 film like I did.  I f possible, see this film in theaters.  It is worth the money.",1380067200,2,2039,4.225974025974026

I was willing to go along with Abrams' update in his first movie, but this one just goes where.... actually, it goes nowhere, except to profitability and bastardization of what was once a true gem in television and cinematic literature.

5293440,3,B009934S5M,"Many of the other reviews focus specifically on the poor business practices of the producers.  Extras have been spread throughout different versions of the film, leaving each ""set"" incomplete.  While I do not condone these practices, I fail to see the point in giving the film itself a poor rating solely for this reason.

As a film and writing enthusiast, Startrek Into Darkness fell short of the previous film.  Rather than the smooth ride that one might expect of a feature film, the director has decided to pay homage to the origination of the concept.  The result is a choppy film that can subdivided into individual episodes.  The first series of these episodes seem redundant as rewards and punishments become as mangled as the relationships between characters.  Perhaps the biggest misstep of the film was its failure to delve the rich mine of the relationships aboard the Enterprise.  The stuttering steps caused by the 'episodes' caused most of these relationships to be taken for granted, rather than taking the time to delve and refine these intricate character connections on-screen.

The introduction of the villain in the film seemed to solidify the plot into one belonging on the big screen.  The contrast between both heroes and villains were made all the more apparent by the muddling of the lines between good and evil.  This lent both credibility to the characters with the justification for their actions, as well redemption for the film that seemed to be gripped in a downward spiral since the beginning.  The action scenes were nice, but each only increased the mounting tension toward the end of the film.  The final bouts ended in my least favorite writing device: A deus ex machina implemented to give future movies in the franchise a... non-recycled plot.

That being said, I am still a huge fan of this attempt at rebooting such a popular series.  I was let down by the format, as well as the laziness of some of the writing tools that were used.  The visuals were just as stunning and I know most fans will enjoy the dichotomy of the original timeline.

In short, I could have cared less about the ""bonds"" of friends and family between the good guys. In fact, the only people I felt for in this film where the bad guys. Solid performances from Simon Pegg and Zack Quinto.

This is a rip-off of Star Trek II, TWOK. A really bad one. Who ""okayed"" this story?

5293450,1,B009934S5M,"Yes, this really is the worst Star Trek movie of all time.  It felt like a Star Wars or a comic book superhero movie.  It did not feel like Star Trek, either Classic, Next Gen, movies, or anything.
Yeah, it made money but it's not Star Trek.

There are plot holes large enough to drive a truck through.  It is all slam bang action.  No time is taken to develop any drama.  Some references to the alternate timeline work, others including a meant-to-be-touching scene are lame recycling of earlier movies.  One could see the ending trick coming 20 minutes in advance which destroyed all drama and suspense.

I liked the first JJ Abrams movie and went along with the juvenile, messed-up Kirk and the alternate timeline.  They could have grown the juvenile Kirk into his real character. It is simply unbelievable that this character would be in command of a starship. And, the crying?  Come on!

The movie is utterly lacking in originality.  The actors are fine (except for the Scotty character). Let's have a re-boot with another director and writers who can write in the next movie.  Maybe even do what classic Star Trek did: get a real science-fiction writer involved rather than Hollywood writers.  With their major production budget, they should be able to do something new.

I've re-watched every Star Trek movie, even ST:TMP and Insurrection.  This one is going on the shelf.  If you are buying because you simply have to, wait for the price to drop.",1379980800,61,1454,4.729083665338646

Still, it's hardly the worst Star Trek film ever made, as some of the original TV show's fans have proclaimed. But there were scenes so hollow they made me wince, and (as in the last movie) the iconic characters are sometimes so far off the mark that no alternate-timeline fig leaf can excuse it. Star Trek was always about the potential of humanity, but this movie seemed barely touched by human hands.",1379980800,2,558,4.427184466019417
5293453,5,B009934S5M,"I really enjoyed the 2009 Star Trek when it first came out in theaters but repeated viewings have not improved my feelings. Visually it is stunning and I have no issues with the casting or acting but the plot is a mess and Chris Pine's interpretation of Captain Kirk is way off the mark. I don't blame Pine because that's the way he's written. Into Darkness corrects a lot of the things that bothered me about the first movie and the plot is tighter. Another problem I had with the 2009 movie was that it had absolutely no message and really didn't honor Gene Roddenberry's legacy. Into Darkness does have a message and it's a good one but the film doesn't bludgeon the viewer with the message.

My top three favorite Star Trek movies are Wrath of Khan, Search for Spock and Undiscovered Country. Into Darkness doesn't break into my top three but it is one of the better Star Trek film despite the feelings of many Star Trek fans. I prefer the more intimate early films but for those who prefer a huge budget action packed thrill ride Into Darkness delivers. Let me give a special nod to the design of the U.S.S. Vengeance which, if you haven't seen it yet, is perhaps the most awesome ship Star Trek has ever produced and that includes the Romulan Narada from the previous film that blew may away in 2009.

Into Darkness actually reminds me a lot of Skyfall if you can believe it. From a technical standpoint both films may be at the pinnacle of their respective series. The casting, the special effects, the set designs and the big moments are thrilling. When the Enterprise rises from an alien ocean it is positively awe inspiring. And then my inner Star Trek nerd pinches me and says, `wait, why was the Enterprise underwater?' Just like with Skyfall it's much better if you don't think too hard about the plot. The plot is much better than the complete nonsense of the previous film but a coherent plot never seems to be the goal of J.J. Abrams so fans can either accept it or do as some Star Trek fans did and declare Into Darkness the works Star Trek film ever.  The new series is just a whole new animal from the previous films.  Comparing Wrath of Khan to Into Darkness is like comparing Skyfall to Goldfinger. They are so different as to be incomparable. You can either accept the changes or cling to the classics but I think that to say this film is terrible on its own merits is just wrong.

One of the biggest complaints was near the end when Into Darkness essentially remade one of the most famous scenes from one of the earliest movies and I won't deny that it made me cringe. I would call the whole scene ill advised rather than a ruination of the movie as some online reviews have suggested. I'm also not thrilled with the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch. Not that he isn't an astounding revelation as an actor and a great addition to Star Trek but the character he plays just doesn't fit.  I can sympathize with many of the criticisms of the film but in the end, like Skyfall, the enjoyment of the experience outweighed the demerits of my own personal criticisms and a repeated viewing only reinforced my appreciation of the movie.",1379980800,3,3149,4.496503496503497

The film was fast paced and enjoyable. 3-D added to the character of HD and I am looking forward to the next installment hopefully again being available in 3D.
J.J. Abrams will have his work cut out for himself in the next film; he's done Nero, he's done Khan, there had better be something else besides another universal renegade bad guy out to destroy the Federation.

5293491,5,B009934S5M,"I did not go into this film with as much dreaded anticipation as I did its predecessor.  There were a lot of things to like and dislike about 'Star Trek Into Darkness,' but overall the film is very enjoyable.  I first watched it back in May in the theater, and again this past weekend after purchasing the Blu-Ray.  The spoilers for this film really put me off, I will admit.  Is he (the deliciously brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch) Khan, is he John Harrison?  After a while I became bored with all the speculation.

The payoff - and let down - is that he's both, and I won't say more than that.  Remember that Abrams' reboot series exists within an alternate universe separate from that Roddenberry and his successors created, so the old rules don't apply.

The opening sequence of the film is absolutely brilliant, with only one real letdown.  The opening sequence consists of Kirk (Chris Pine) and McCoy (Karl Urban) on a very lush and colorful planet (called Nibiru) running from very alien-looking primitive natives.  Elsewhere, Spock (Zach Quinto), Sulu (John Cho), and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) are attempting to deactivate a very violent volcano that's about to erupt and would eventually eradicate this burgeoning species.  The opening sequence, while it has nothing to do with the rest of the film, touches on one of the basic tenets of the entire Trek mythology and if Abrams' team is smart they will come back to this in future films.  My only gripe is that the crew has submerged the Enterprise under the planet's ocean to observe this primitive species.  First, a ship of the Enterprise's design and configuration could not enter an atmosphere much less be submerged in water.  If you are a diehard Trekkie you have to suspend your disbelief on that one.  Second, why do they need to be underwater to observe this culture or render the active volcano inert?  This is a primitive culture with no real technology ... they aren't going to a detect a ship in orbit.

The plot for 'Into Darkness' is very well-conceived.  While I was disappointed they decided to take a classic Trek film (The Wrath of Khan) and some elements of TOS (John Harrison, a frequently used minor character) and even DS9 (Section 31), they took the references and twisted them into something unique so that the story felt fresh.  The inclusion of the character of Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), obviously much younger than when we met her in TWOK, added an extra dimension to the story's second villain, the war-hungry Starfleet Admiral who sought out war with the Klingons.  As in the 2009 film, each of the ""main characters"" received something important to do.  McCoy, Scotty (Simon Pegg), Sulu, and Checkov (Anton Yelchin) once again take a back seat to Kirk/Spock/Uhura, but each character is paid enough attention so that you don't feel they're just taking up space.  The inclusion of Carol Marcus as a member of the Enterprise crew at the end of the film, when the ship embarks on it's ""historic five-year mission"" is a nice surprise.  Clearly this was set up as a romantic plot-point for Kirk in the next film.

I will say I hope for the third installment of the reboot series Abrams does not borrow elements from previous films.  I don't want to see anymore characters from the established Gene Roddenberry universe.  Abrams created the perfect set-up with his alternate universe, and since the end of this film shows the Enterprise embarking on its original ""five-year mission"" I'm sure there's a lot of original stories that would excite fans.  Before I close, there are two things I must mention.  First, the Klingons did not need a makeover.  They don't look menacing at all. Why did the Klingons need to be redone?  It's like remaking the Romulans in the last film.  The Klingons from The Next Gen/DS9/Voyager era look far more menacing than these ""glistening creatures.""  Second, the utilization of Leonard Nimoy was cheap and did nothing for the story.  If Spock Prime appears in the next film it needs to be sending him home to his own universe.  Keeping two Spocks in one universe is dumb.

Overall I am giving this film five stars, because despite the minor plot holes the film is engaging and held my interest.  Abrams and Co. do a great job of continuing the story they began in 2009's 'Star Trek' reboot.",1379894400,2,4298,4.760810810810811
5293492,2,B009934S5M,"Roddenberry was all about space opera - brave social commentary and controversy explored in the context of some pretty cheesy special effects. The original series had melodramatic acting, but it was rescued by comedic timing and genuine chemistry between the characters.

In contrast, ""Into Darkness"" says nothing. It has a boring plot, predictable timing, console-gaming battle scenes, huge holes and puzzlers in the plot (why, exactly, was it necessary for the Enterprise to be under water than in orbit in order to stay out of sight?), and only a few little Easter eggs for fans. The sly nods to the original series were fun - for example, the scene of Kirk dying of radiation poisoning instead of Spock, and Spock being the one to yell ""Khaaaaaaaan!"" - but these were scattered and few. In the Kirk-resurrection scene, I wish we would have seen the tribble pop into two pieces and after a camera cutaway, a glimpse of the table being full of tribbles and a couple of them falling off. That would've been great.

Some commentators have dissed the wooden acting, but how much of that is because these actors have to have a resemblance to the characters in the original series? They are constrained by the styles of a different set of actors, so I can give them some latitude.

Simon Pegg as Scotty is a delicious little amuse-bouche in the middle of this boring smorgasbord of stitched-together action sequences.",1379894400,5,1414,4.858921161825726

5293497,4,B009934S5M,"There's a LOT of reviews for this, so I'll just keep to my likes and dislikes and a summation point.

LIKED-

-demo material for video and sound, a stunner
-actors are fantastic
-very entertaining and fast-paced, never a dull moment
-risk-taking in it's narrative to revisit a classic Star Trek story from a different angle
-Uhura negotiating

DISLIKED-

-a noticeable lack of Dr. McCoy.  Karl Urban is a great character actor, he seemed side-lined in this film
-the hype, the 'no spoilers!' thing... having 'secrets' of the storyline which only serve to make reviewers, or anyone(!), look like bad guys when they wanted to explain why they thought something didn't work
-the plot.  It's a serious hot mess
-Lifting the dialog from the most famous scene from the Star Trek films, almost verbatim, as if the writers had just given up
-predictable face-punching finale
-Killing off my favorite secondary character

PERSONAL OPINION-

the best thing I can say about Into Darkness is that they made (after a long wait) a fun, fast-paced, good-looking summer blockbuster, and that there will be more Star Trek films to come.  That's a good thing!

The worst thing I can say is that the cast and crew (and audience!) for these films are capable and deserving of a higher standard of writing.  The dramatic scenes in this film where the actors get to act?  They're OUTSTANDING.  Full of emotional depth!  But they're the filler in a hyper, Rube-Goldberg action story that keeps diverting you to some other thing, and gives you no time to digest what you're seeing, or get any sense of what the film is about.",1379894400,,1601,4.816849816849817

5293499,2,B009934S5M,This movie had some entertaining action. That having been said... Much of this film was hindered by its ill conceived plot and poor script. It replaces the intelligent social commentary science fiction with pithy dialogue and clever references without much substance. The cast is good highlighted by Simon Pegg and Karl Urban.

5293503,2,B009934S5M,"How a viewer responds to this film depends entirely on what one is hoping to get out of it. That may be the case with every film and thus a statement of the obvious, but I think that it is especially true with regard to this one. If one is just looking for an exciting, briskly-paced film with plenty of action, an attractive cast and some great visuals, then Star Trek Into Darkness will deliver. It is certainly not guilty of being boring, as some previous ST films have been.

On the other hand, if one is looking for a well-written screenplay or a new-ground-breaking story, those things are not to be found here. I will grant that this film attempts to deal with some current issues such as terrorism and militarism, but it does not develop those themes nearly as well as it could have it if was not so busy shamelessly, clumsily recycling elements from Stark Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Now, I certainly enjoy seeing familiar faces show up again and graceful nods to the past. But there is a big difference between that done well, and the way that it is done in this film. This smacks of laziness,unoriginality and really just a profound lack of either comprehension and/or care for what Star Trek is really about, i.e. exploring new territory and addressing issues with eloquence. What a frustratingly wasted opportunity, considering the fresh reboot that this franchise has potentially been given.

Specifically, the use of Benedict Cumberbatch's character is in my personal view an unforgivable sin. He is a very fine actor and if the screenplay would only continue on the path that it starts out on with regard to the character in the early parts of the film, things could be great. But for some reason, the writers/director/producers felt compelled to be clever or something and twist the character in an entirely arbitrary, disrespectful and ultimately ineffective way. I do not like to be very negative, but in this case, it simply cannot go unnoted.

On the brighter (okay, darker) flip side, there is one scene in which this film really breaks through into the realm of truly, insanely good:
SPOILER**************
*********************
*********************
When Khan kills Admiral Marcus on the dark bridge of the warship, as Kirk watches stunned and Carol screams like she's in a slasher film, for a brief moment STID lives up to its name and gives us something truly crazy and new. It's violent, but it's sharply composed and purely effective. A film full of that sort of vivid content would have impressed me.
*********************
END SPOILER**********

To wrap up, Star Trek Into Darkness is fine as a casual, do-not-think-about-it too much ""spaceships and lasers"" action film. But it is not a good Star Trek film. Worth watching at least once, if only to form an objective personal opinion? Sure. But I am sincerely hoping for something much better the next time around. Star Trek deserves better.

Note: The basic DVD-only version of this film does not include any special features to speak of. That is unfortunate for those of us who have not yet switched to Blu-Rays, but to be expected I suppose.",1379808000,14,3122,4.82803738317757

Dang! I can never get that straight).

So this second installment of the 'JJ Abrahms Reboot' of the original series features the alternative universe timeline of that lovable crew: Kirk, Spock, Bones, and the rest..He sticks to the general current of the original series river, so the second film tracks with the original series BEST (imho) film, ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"" featuring Ricardo Montalban as Khan (and he was OUTSTANDING as the evil Khan).  Somehow, JJ does the impossible and after seeing Benedict Cumberbatch's 'Sherlock Holmes' (a bravura performance in itself), cast him as this generation's evil Khan, which helped make this the best film in the series. From the warp core technology shot at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, to the volcano suit, bridge, and other tech, the film delivers impeccable production design.  The performances are all first rate; from Khan's deviousness to Spock's humanity; from Kirk's humility to Scotty's comedy; I really love this cast!

Sadly there was little space opera in this film or the previous one, and it seems that coherent scripting has flown out the window,only to be replaced by more fancy special effects. (ooohhhh shiney......)

As for all the ""trek fans"" that love this film I can only ask why?
There has been little ""Trek"" in any of these movies save for characters,background,and similar ships.
the scripts have been sorely lacking in the meat of a story.

Am I the only person that has a problem with the fact that kirk never really completed the academy, never held down any
other command,let alone served any other duties?
Yet they just ""hand"" him over the command of the newest ship of the line?(would not happen, no matter what)
Talk about a reflection of never having to earn anything and things just get handed to you.
Interpersonal relationships are and will be frowned upon.(really a relationship spat in the middle of a mission? come on)

 I did give a 2 star instead of 1. I felt the casting for Spock,Bones,Scotty and Sulu were spot on.
As this is only my opinion feel free to phaser me as needed.
But ask yourself this what made Firefly,Farscape,Voyager, Next Gen. (for the most part),and Classic trek popular?,
engaging stories. Which is what these movies have lacked. JJ makes great movies but not good trek.

If I had a new Smart TV or hi-HDTV set, this would look and sound amazing.

I like the way this series of writings is ""tying"" into key points of the original tv series.  I hope JJ Abrams will take this ""alternate"" Star Trek into a new direction.  I realize that the characters may be the same, but the plot lines are open to wherever the writer wishes to go.
With so many of these alternate reality time line shows, the premise is that we are the correct time line.  It would be interesting to see some ""new"" characters which the plot indicates our time line character has been killed and this new time line character can take the story to a different set of goals.

5293559,5,B009934S5M,"While I am more of a ""The Next Generation"" and ""Voyager"" fan, I have fallen in love with Karl Urban's Bones in the new movies. IMO, this movie is actually better then the first one! The comedy is there (the argument between Uhura and Spock while Kirk is stuck between them is my favorite), the bonding has taken place from the first movie to where you believe these characters have been together since they assembled in the first, and a bit of tradition thrown in there for long-time Trek fans. The movie is fast-paced, sometimes I think a little too much, but I appreciate that they don't linger on details like some of the previous Star Treks have done. I love the return of some of the favorite lines from the first movie like Scotty's ""Get down!"" So while J.J. Abrams is building on the Star Trek so many Trek fans know, he's also building that what he has created new for us. I do have to say to something that has nothing to do with anything else in this review.... the moment that Uhura turns to kiss Spock in front of everyone really surprised me, but I loved it when he lowered his head to allow it.

All in all, J.J. has done a great job. I love this movie even more the first and have watched it already more then I have watched the first one. I think both non-traditional Trek fans and true-blue Trek fans will love it if they don't go digging for reasons not to. J.J. has rebirthed Star Trek, a tradition that was lost to many new potential fans, and he's doing awesome at the helm!

But forget Spock and Kirk (even though the actors are perfect), it's Bones is my new favorite thanks to Karl Urban! And let's be honest... that's who I loved returning to my screen!",1379808000,,1678,4.3238095238095235

The first JJ Abrams Star Trek was a huge step up, but you could tell that while Abrams is an amazing film maker, he was not (yet) a Trekkie.

In this film we now have the best of both worlds.  The touch of a world-class director with the touches only a Trekkie would add.

I found the characters (in terms of writing, direction and acting) to be absolutely perfect.  Jame T. Kirk without the cheesy Shatner acting.  Bones in a believable persona.  The struggles of Spock in more than one dimension.  And an Uhura like you have never seen her.

If you love Star Trek you will love Into The Darkness.  But even if you are not a Trekkie you'll love this film.",1379808000,,894,4.224852071005917
5293562,4,B009934S5M,"I was a Star Trek fan back in the 1960's and one who kept writing NBC when they were trying to cancel it.  It is hard to deal with this new timeline that is the background for the last two Trek movies.  The plot this time, story writing, and dialogue surpassed the previous Trek movie.  It was fast paced as most Trek movies are.  I do have difficulty with the actor who portrays Scotty in the New one.  But that is my problem.  I am sure that he is a fine person, but he is NOT Scotty.  I liked the special effects and think back to the cardboard bridge and sets of the first series on tv.  It appeals to all in that it pits the good guys against the bad guys.  The villain was very villainous, but hard to beat Ricardo Maltaban in my favorite of all of the previous Star Trek, meaning Star Trek the Wrath of Khan.  I will see it again, as I love the franchise, and the characters that go along with it.  It is just would not have taken the series down the different time line;  I was obliviously happy in my ""old"" Trek time line",1379808000,2,1030,4.044554455445544

5293566,2,B009934S5M,"Gone to the Khan well, one to many times. Kinda like they got 3/4 of the way through a movie, realized they didn't have an ending, so stole and rewrote (badly)the ending from one of the franchise's classics. Too many momentary shots of corny looking alien characters, in make-up, appearing to be inspired partially from Mary Poppins, and part from the Star Wars cantina scene. Special effects weren't so well executed and what the story line lacked in comprehension, it failed to compensate for with a nervous urgency to move on to the next action sequence. The token homage to the original cast, by incorporating ""original timeline Spock"" into the story is really lame and cliche now, as it was the first time. Not much here to recommend, except the Spock & Bones characterizations, capture the original series portrayals, pretty well, while updating themselves, into their roles a bit. The rest of it, not so much. Like the Bond movies, Beatles tribute bands and Twinkies, these brands are reaching the end of their use by dates. Great in their day, but you had to be there to understand what the electricity was all about, and it's difficult to recapture that, at this later timeline.",1379721600,3,1187,4.823529411764706

This one started on a wrong foot with Kirk chased by a band of natives covered in white paint in a land of
blood red trees and vegetation while a volcano is erupting!
Could someone in Hollywood come up with a more inventive set piece to kick off the film?
The rest of the movie is a patch work of borrowings from this film and that film with some intense action sequences to wake
up the viewers' senses.
The saving grace of this instalment is Benedict Cumberbatch who lends some credibility and class to this mash while
Chris Pine's Kirk has become an embarrassment to this franchise.

I've enjoyed the 1960's television series, all the movies that starred Shatner, Nimoy and that bunch, the 'Next Generation' tv series and movies.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the way the reboot has been handled and love the way we get to see both what is familiar (our beloved original characters albeit in new ways) and what is not (Kahn being portrayed as a member of the federation).  JJ Abrams was definitely the one to bring the reboot to the big screen.  I hope we get to enjoy more of these innovative films for years to come!",1379721600,,568,4.380952380952381

5293572,4,B009934S5M,"Referring to the Star Trek franchise of course. I go all the way back to watching the original first run episodes of the original series. Over forty five years ago!? I have checked out just about all the Star Trek spin-offs along the way. From the very good (Star Trek TNG) to awful (most of the first series of Shatner/Nimoy Star Trek films, except for the funny one with the whales). On the whole, I'm glad to see Star Trek still truckin' along. It has been a constant in my life for so long.

As to this film, well how many decades has it been now since so many blockbuster films have starred special effects, stunt doubles, model makers, and blue screens? As film after film has tried to surpass the last in action sequences, I long ago lost interest. When all the spectacle was over, the good guys still won.

It's still the characters and the relationships between them that determine whether a film is really any good or not. So I'm happy to say that this film is good. Seeing the original Star Trek characters portrayed by different actors at a different time is fun. And it's done with sufficient humor and well-acted pathos to keep your interest.

If someone were completely unfamiliar with the world of Star Trek, I don't think that that person would enjoy the film much, except in so far as they love gigantic action sequences featuring lots of destruction and last second escapes from disaster. Their are lots of inside jokes and references to the future adventures of the crew of the Enterprise. (I have always liked the touch with which Federation ships were given the names of former US Navy ships from earlier centuries. Starting with the Enterprise, the greatest ship of the Second World War. A lot of people probably thought that the space shuttle ""Enterprise"" was named after the Star Trek ship. In fact, maybe it was.)

That said, I enjoyed this film immensely. There are always things that fans would like to see differently, but the film was amazingly cast, acted, and filmed. There are few scifi films shot with this level of excellence. Set aside you love of TOS and view this as a re-imagining, you'll be surprised how much you love it!",1379721600,,463,4.155555555555556

Of course, in wrath there was no mention made of running into Khan earlier - but no every nuance can be thought of in advance.  I really like the cast of both of the 'new' Star Trek movies. This movie has a darker, more dramatic story than the first movie (which I prefer because it was lighter and the bringing together of the cast - which was a treasure for Original series Trekkies - was more entertaining than the story-drama of the movie). Both movies are very good. Having been a Star Trek original series fan (I was in the 7th grade when the series debuted ) I didn't think it would have been possible that a 'new' replacement crew could be gathered that so remarkable resembled the original actors and in style, bearing and character.

5293589,5,B009934S5M,Its not normal that I like both a movie and its sequel - but this sequel does very well.  I like how they made certain twists to the plot.  Khan is more outwardly evil than in the original but the actor who plays him does an excellent job of paralleling the two movies.  It was a great all around action packed film with some dark humor.  Loved Spock and Uhura throughout the film. Wished there was more Scotty but still enjoyed what little there was of him.  Great film altogether!  :D :D :D,1379721600,,492,4.236559139784946

5293591,1,B009934S5M,"I pre-ordered this title back in May when it was first announced. As we all know, it quickly sold-out shortly afterwards and has been sold-out for months.

I kept waiting for the order to arrive after it shipped earlier this month and after almost 2 weeks, I get an e-mail from Amazon.com advising my order had been cancelled and that I'd be refunded.

When I contacted a CSR via chat that day, I was told that DHL had ""lost"" my order and that an investigation would be started by Amazon's shipping department. I finally get the refund on my credit card only to realize that the import fee had not been refunded.

I chatted with another CSR again today and once the fee was refunded, I asked to have more info about the investigation. Not only was I advised Amazon.com doesn't release investigation results with customers, I was advised that my order was never lost at all... it was DAMAGED. I was not advised how ""damaged"" the order was... for all I know, it could just be a small corner of the box that's crumpled.

I was told to place the order again. Yeah... right... order something that's been sold out for months? Fat chance that's going to happen. My only complaint about Amazon.com is that they refuse to let me know what happened or moreso how it happened. My main beef is with DHL Global Mail. I strongly implore Amazon.com to ditch them and go with Fedex or UPS for international shipments. If they're going to charge us $17 for an import fee, it might as well be spent on a courier that isn't going to damage or lose your parcel before it even reaches the border. (For the record, the parcel was damaged immediately after it left Amazon.com's warehouse if the tracking info is anything to be believed).

I would not be as angry if this would have happened with a regular item, but when it occurs with limited edition exclusives that sell-out a few days after pre-order, that's a whole other mess in itself.",1379721600,2,1919,4.518731988472623

Fun and entertaining.",1379721600,,366,4.097222222222222
5293593,5,B009934S5M,"For me, the first ten minutes of the film is the best part. That's not to say I did not enjoy the rest of the movie, because I did. It is definitely a solid sequel that tells an entertaining story. It just feels like there may have been too much indecision in the direction, too much build up in trying to keep a secret and too much of a nod to the past (ala Bryan Singer's Superman Returns). That said, it is still a terrific film as we continue to watch the growing and deepening relationship between Kirk and Spock that Spock Prime foreshadowed in the first JJ 'verse film a few years ago.

Benedict Cumberbatch is magnificent in the role of John Harrison/?. He really is a multifaceted antagonist. Alice Eve settles in nicely as Carol Marcus, and I can't wait to see her interact with the rest of the crew in a third film. I was honestly disappointed that the other members of the supporting cast did not have more to do, especially Karl Urban. whose portrayal of Bones is uncanny and terrific. I could probably watch a two hour movie of Urban just speaking in character.

As for the first ten minutes, it does feature all of the returning characters and shows the promise of the last film when they warped away on their first official mission as a crew. The consequences of their actions in the opening 10 minutes really sets up Kirk's journey in the film, although after an attack on Starfleet, that moment tends to get lost a bit. Still, for my money, those 10 minutes are so much fun as Kirk and McCoy attempt to lure natives away from their home without violating the prime directive as Spock, Uhura and Sulu attempt to extinguish a planet-wide threat that would spell extinction for it's indigenous species. We see another awesome moment of the Enterprise (i.e. Jupiter's rings from the first film) as well as the impact of ignoring the prime directive.",1379721600,,1863,4.525222551928783

5293609,5,B009934S5M,"As soon as I saw this movie in theaters, I knew I just had to own it. The way it was able to get me to feel for all the characters at some point or another was just fantastic! I ended up seeing it four times while it was in theaters and then had it on pre-order a few months before it came out on DVD. I love the character arcs, with Kirk being is normal reckless self and not taking responsibility for his actions at the beginning, while Spock shows his capacity for self-sacrifice and being so wrapped up in rules. But by the end their roles have been switched, and both of them even say to each other, ""It's what you would've done."" I was crying by that point. I even felt bad for Khan when he describes thinking he lost his entire family. I was pretty sure he couldn't be trusted, but I was seriously questioning that for a while there... I like the glimpses we get to see into Spock's and Uhura's relationship, as well. I also love it when Spock finally reveals to Kirk that he was lying through his teeth earlier when he said he chose not to feel anything when he thought he was going to die; that ""Vulcans never lie"" bit isn't true 100% of the time - *cue dramatic music*! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves fiction, science fiction, or action movies; even my sister, the die hard Star Wars fan who found the first Star Trek remake to be only ok, absolutely loved this movie. I went through the emotional roller coaster, what with sympathizing with Khan, crying for Kirk, and then being enraged with Spock. I literally wanted to shout ""Kill him! Kill him!"" when Spock chases down Khan, but then with one sentence from Bones, I suddenly wanted to yell ""Wait Spock! Don't kill him!"" I can't think of another movie that has made me do a complete emotional 180 in such a short period of time like this one did :)",1379635200,3,1836,4.278735632183908

5293615,1,B009934S5M,"Forgive Them, Gene Roddenberry, They know not what they do or did!

While this flick might provide for a satisfactory pubescent [blow-em-up while you pop-your-zits] type of video game experience, but as an old school sci-fi kind of trekkie,
my expectations were to be captivated by inspiring, intelligent dialogue, thought provoking,thrilling plot & the timeless monumentality of Gene Roddenberry's characters[Kirk & Spock, & Co].
In this version of Star Trek, plot & dialogue have been replaced by incessant blinding explosions, flashy artificial space-goober visual effects, staccato,
repetitive weapon-blasts, in a melee of mindless, testosterone-inspired battles. The blah, bland, bromidic, clichd, cornball, cornfed, corny,
dull as dishwater, lack-luster, unconvincing, performances of the actors was just uncomfortable & unfulfilling to watch;
in summery- this entire production could be described as a cringe-worthy & dumbed-down caricature of *The Real Deal*. Sad.
Someone here, had written that the director of this movie[J.J. Abrams]should be taken out back & shot, *grins*; I don't agree.
I think it should be a slow death that hurts a whole lot- as a memorable life lesson
to never, no matter how much personal/financial gain can be realized, take something
of brilliance, wit, originality, & excellence & turn it into Drek, into Darkness.",1379635200,15,1351,5.655172413793103
5293616,1,B009934S5M,"When you watch science fiction, you take for granted that you will have to suspend your disbelief to a good degree, but sometimes it's more than you can take. We're really supposed to believe that there was no better option than to dangle Spock from a cable into an active volcano? And then, wouldn't you know it, HE FALLS IN! Luckily he manages to land in a safe spot. Every active volcano about to blow its top must have at least one, I think it's an EPA requirement. Who could have seen that coming...just about anyone who's ever seen a movie before. Meanwhile, it's really important that the natives not see us, so we'll hide the Enterprise in the ocean! OK, maybe something happened to all the shuttle crafts and they aren't space worthy right now, or more likely, it was just another cheap ploy to incorporate some cool special effects, like a starship rising out of the sea, glistening with CGI water! Give me a break. And it just goes on like that.

And then, there's Khan. Does he look like a Khan? Does he sound like a Khan? And his acting, it reminded me of that big Easter dinner at Grandma's house: so much ham!

Sure, a person can overlook all the flaws and enjoy the action and special effects, and many of us who have written negative reviews probably wouldn't have bothered if it weren't for what is being done to a once great franchise. Instead of trying to reinvent Star Trek, why not make a new sci-fi action movie? There's obviously a market for it, and many of us would be willing to pay good money to see such a thing, if only it were done WELL.",1379635200,12,1568,4.384879725085911

I don't like spoilers but if you love Star Trek and are open minded to the franchise evolving with being handed to a new storyteller then this should be right up your alley.

Okay so the product gets 2 to 3 Stars in my book.  The extras for the 2009 Star Trek film are way more abundant &, most importantly, elucidating.  The package for Into Darkness underwhelms.  Disappointingly so.  It's a 3 disc package.  You should get 1, the movie with great commentaries, 2, a digital copy portable into iTunes etc, and, 3, over 2 hours of behind the scenes content.  This third area can include deleted scenes but it should greatly expand on how the movie was put together.  Give you a great perspective on the end-to-end production.

Word on the street is every different package has different extras.  This is a major ""Boo!"".  If you buy the flagship package, you should be denied nothing.  (Period.).

Why were the crew of the Enterprise not taught about the Eugenics Wars in school? Why is Khan white? Why do the Klingons look wrong?

If you want to see an exciting starship chase scene, or, a lot of CGI explosions, and, a hottie in her underwear, this movie is for you. In other words, you fit the target audience, which probably considers the original Star Trek series too slow and ""cerebral."" That is, you're likely between 13-23 years old and don't remember that Star Trek wasn't just about things exploding (at least, for the most part).

That said, if this wasn't labeled ""Star Trek,"" and was just a sci-fi action movie, it would've been a perfectly fine one. It's just saddening to people who've grown up with the original concept to see what it has degenerated into -- just another shoot-em-up in space. Note to J.J.: could you have made this movie without making each of these well-known characters a cartoon-image of what they were? No? Then why make a ""Star Trek"" movie? Oh wait...it sells, because the kids will want to see that underwear scene, and things going ""boom,"" and, the millions of people who're already in love with what ST used to be will give it one more chance because they're desperate for a new ST film. It's ingenious.

Spock: Used to be Spock. Thank heaven this guy can still look stoic, because that's where the similarities end.

Kirk: Is a wuss. He can't figure out that he's a leader? How about choosing a job besides Starship Captain?

Uhura: Yeah, now she's a central figure...which means she has finally fulfilled Nichelle Nichol's deluded fantasy that the communications officer was something more than a receptionist on the original Star Trek.

McCoy: Someone tried to be McCoy at least.

Scotty: Gets drunk onscreen. A nod to us old ST fans. See, this film has something for everybody!

Chekov, Sulu: Who cares?

And, KHAN: Oh, MAN, they made Kahn a homicidal maniac cyborg! Great! Wasn't it cool when he smashed that guy's head? Ricardo Montalban was waaaayyy to boring a Kahn -- THIS one smashes heads! Yay!

One more thing...please, when you make ""Star Trek 3: The Final Milking of a Beloved Franchise,"" exclude a Leonard Nimoy cameo. He looked as embarrassed to be in this trash as I felt paying to watch it.",1379635200,81,2166,4.736702127659575

5293646,4,B009934S5M,"A lot of the criticism that Into Darkness seemed to get was that it didn't follow Roddenberry's ""utopian"" future, exploration driven story lines, that classic TOS exposed.  This claim is bogus for two main reasons, that I see anyway...  One...if you don't believe that it didn't adhere to the exploration mantra, did you not hear the numerous lines about how the Enterprise was about to be sent out on its 5-year mission?  They're getting around to it, OK?  Either in the next movie or in a potential TV series.  So they go side-tracked by the whole Khan thing...give'em a break.  Yeah, OK, and maybe the taunting of the Klingon Empire to start a Interstellar War.

And two, the idea that Star Trek isn't about conflict, war, or just having to deal with a really bad guy, and a corrupt Starfleet Admiral, is just being disingenuous as there have been MANY Star Trek episode/movies that have dealt with similar themes.  And this business whether one action was moral or ethical (as per that conversation between Scotty and Kirk) was a bit ridiculous, as I couldn't even follow the logic in that discussion.  And I'm a logical thinking guy.  Because the way I saw most of the moral dilemmas in this film all had to deal with the age ol' Vulcan Proverb of ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.""  It was all about the question of whet someone will do to save their best friend or their crew.  And if you put saving your friend over everything else, the rest of the moral dilemmas in the film make much more sense.  So I had no problem with all the moral decisions in this movie.  You do whatcha gotta do.

War with the Klingons?  Hell, yeah!  Bring it on!  I hope Trek 3 will continue on with a potential War with the Klingons....just as long as they leave out something about a Genesis Planet...know what I mean?  Just start off the 5-year mission as you would expect, and then being called into action by Starfleet by an incursion into the Neutral Zone by the Klingons.

All that being said, I thought Into Darkness was a good film, not a great film, but a solidly good film.  I give it a 4.5 stars.  The only thing that it really needed little more space stuff, although it had more than I thought it would given some of the other reviews I've read.  What it did lack was Enterprise fighting back.  She was so beat up by sabotage and the Vengeance blasting her to bits, that she didn't have a change to fire phasers or torpedoes.",1379548800,,2444,4.440449438202247

5293648,1,B009934S5M,"So. You want to make a movie? You want to make a really bad, terrible, awful, stupid, rotten movie about star ships? Well, you have a difficult fence to climb. That movie has already been made, my friend. And it is called ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"".

If you wish to compete with this cesspool of a movie, you have several challenges to overcome: First you must find a script written by a demented, half-witted sixth grader who does not speak English and who has never, ever seen a good movie, ever in his life. Then, you have to gather together a collection of incompetent, inept, terrible actors: the kind of actors who couldn't get into the third-grade production of Horton Hears A Who, even if they bribed the teacher. Actors who cannot act; actors for whom ""acting"" is a completely unfamiliar concept. Third: you have to find a director who is not only a microcephalic mollusk with delusions of sapience, but who also is illiterate, feckless and blind. It is absolutely essential that your director also be a great admirer of Ed Wood, but with far less talent. And finally, it is crucial that you find a special effects master who desires and aspires, above all other things in life, to reach the pinnacle of special effects magic of a blind, spastic, epileptic, bedwetting, drooling lobotomy patient. You put those folks together in combination, and they will make a movie that is at least six hundred and eighty times better than ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"". At least. It might even turn out to be six hundred and eighty WARP better.

This movie was astoundingly bad. Astoundingly times warp to the googol power bad. Bad. Worse than any bad you can think of. So very, very bad. Really. Bad. Beyond all the bad you have ever seen, imagined, dreamed or contemplated. Bad. Awful. Bad. Seriously. Bad. This movie: very, very, very bad. Really. Bad!",1379548800,3,1849,4.7213622291021675

5293662,5,B009934S5M,"Having read some of the negative reviews of Star Trek into Darkness I was expecting a scene by scene rip off of The Wrath of Khan from 1982. In reality, the new Star Trek film is more a remake or even a prequel to the first film.  The plot changes are substantial with Benedict Cumberbatch's coldly calculating Khan seeking revenge for the supposed murder of his crew and Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus, who uses Khan to develop super weapons and sends the Enterprise to unwittingly start a war with the Kligons.  While there are some similarities to the Wrath of Khan (a few lines of dialogue and the reactor malfunction) the new Star Trek has a refreshing plot line with the creation of a new and fascinating Khan.

For me, this really an ensemble film with the actors filling out their roles from the first film.  The interactions between Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachery Quinto mirror that of William Shattner and Leonard Nimoy but they add their own spin to their characters, making them their own. The supporting cast -  John Cho (as Sulu), Simon Pegg (as Scotty), Anton Yelchin (as Chekov), and Karl Urban (as McCoy) - all have sizeable roles in the film.  Simon Pegg and Karl Urban were especially fun to see with McCoy's one liners and Scotty's excitability over the state of the Enterprise's engines.

JJ Abrams provides the same high level of action as he did in his first venture into the Star Trek franchise. The mix of action and character development is well-balanced. The special effects fit the story rather than the other way around. The futuristic San Francisco was marvelous to behold. Altogether this is a terrific action science-fiction film.",1379548800,,1662,4.730103806228374

5293669,4,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness brings us a kind nod to Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan, just without Kirk's son, the planet Genesis, or the death of Spock.  Of course, those that are not familiar with the original Trek films will not necessarily follow what I am referring to, which is fine as this film stands on its own.  Personally, my favorite part is the cameo of Lenard Nimoy reprising his role of Spock (or Spock Prime for those that recall the title credits from the previous film).  While I did see Lenard Nimoy's name in the credits of this film, I was disappointed that they did not tie his name to the character he portrayed, ah well.  The story's opening is a little confusing with the Enterprise being hidden in the ocean of an M Class planet.  The problem that is created is Kirk taking the ship out of the ocean and the planet's inhabitants witnessing the Enterprise leaving the ocean in an endeavor to rescue Spock.  My issue with this is, how would the inhabitants not see the Enterprise leaving the ocean, even if he had not gone after Spock.  At any rate, I get that the story needed a vehicle to have Kirk (temporarily) removed from being captain of the Enterprise to drive the story.  From there the story switches to the introduction of Khan and the start of his mission against the Federation.  Without giving away the details, the ""good"" guys win the day but instead of Khan meeting a gruesome end as in ""Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan"", this Khan is stuck in a cryogenic tube and put into storage along with his crew.",1379548800,,1535,4.414893617021277

In fact, the whole movie is.  I think it is high time for ""Star Trek"" to finally RIP -- and no further infusions of super-modified DNA are necessary -- we all know the plot.

As some reviews have mentioned, the replicas may be defective or have flaws, so it's best to open and check yours.  The only problem with my phaser was the spinning of the stun/kill barrel.  It was some what tight.  Other than that, pretty flawless.  If you didn't preorder this, they're already sold out so you probably can only get one thru secondary market.  They did claim it was limited.  It would get more stars if it was made better with some parts that worked.",1379548800,,1016,4.4324324324324325

AKA hardcore Trekkies) out there that have made the original Star Trek universe their whole lives, and enjoy nothing more than pointing out the inaccuracies in J.J. Abram's reboot, this film in my opinion is outstanding. It is these types of people that need to realize that doing a complete re-hash of old material, just with a white wash of modern-day special effects, set design, etc. is not going to sell movie tickets and keep butts in the seats. You need to have at least a dash of something new to keep things fresh, and interesting.

SPOILERS AHEAD:
J.J. has found a way to bring the Star Trek universe to the masses with a recipe that just works. This film is yet another action packed sci-fi drama with a spattering of humorous moments. Without being too overly derivative (as the fan boys/girls would like), Star Trek Into Darkness has its roots in the original second Star Trek film, ""Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan."" Using elements that worked in J.J.'s first Star trek film (2009), Star Trek Into Darkness fuses these elements with some of the most iconic moments of the original but, with a twist to accommodate the alternate reality introduced to us in 2009.

Now I did find some parts to be silly like: the treatment of the Star Fleet admiral (I can't explain why, you'll just have to form your opinion; that is just what I took away from his performance), and possibly even more importantly... how come no body else privy to the information Kirk (Chris Pine) was reviewing in the mandated meeting of Star Fleet Captains and their First Officers was able to jump to the conclusion he did (just before Khan [Benedict Cumberbatch] lit the room up) but, I digress. I realize that this scene moves the plot along but still. Nevertheless, Star Trek Into Darkness is a fantastic film; in a otherwise somewhat lack-luster field of blockbusters this summer, I really don't see where there is room to complain as fervently as some other people are about this film.",1379462400,2,2051,4.662983425414365

5293702,4,B009934S5M,"I loved the initial Pine/Quinto ST effort, and this one is not too far off the quality of that effort. I still think Wrath Of Khan is the best Trek film to date, mainly due to the rich Corinthian leather (smile if you remember those '70s ads!), but STID is a very respectable entry into the ever-expanding Trek universe.

Pine and Quinto make a great pair, and Urban and Pegg's silliness works pretty well. The Vulcan love subplot is a tad goofy and unreal but then so is everything in the Trekverse, so why worry? The script has some good laughs, some solid action, and a few interesting concepts, though I for one would like more of the latter next time out. It's the mind-bending ideas that made the best Trek episodes work, and Abrams should seek to get more of them in next time around. This world is so rich in possibility it seems a shame not to play that side of it to the hilt.

As for the ripoff marketing of this film, all I can say is we'll keep getting more and more of that as long as we put up with it, so stand up and simply DON'T BUY ANY OF IT! They only do it because they know so many Trekkies are serious collectors. If you don't buy all their versions maybe they'll get the message.

Or just do what we do and rent these for half a buck at your local rental box with a monthly membership, or one night rental for a buck at the kiosk. That's all the cash they'll get from me!

All in all, this is a good Trek entry and this cast looks set to give us quite a good run of fun films. I think Roddenberry would be pleased with how Abrams is doing so far.",1379462400,,1570,4.087662337662338

Sorry but Kahn's 2nd redo plus some lefotvers/retreads from the other movies does not do the team justice. All it lacked was a good script. Even a decent script.

I know Star Trek, sir, and you are no Star Trek!
I watched Star Trek with my Dad and my Brother when I was young. I saw all the movies, the television shows like Next Generation, Voyager, Enterprise which makes me sad to experience this.
This is like a Hunger Games future (unique and outrageous fashion sense) collided with a star trek/tokyo drift spoof took over or started their own intergalactic agency not for exploration though. It is an alternative to a high school education that you get to travel on a star ship and play grab @## with the universe. But of course there is the plot sprinkling from The Wrath of Khan for nostalgia and to give a semblance of a story line because you run out of colors to paint the people on the funky colored worlds after a while. That and it begs the question is this the pinnacle and illustrious branch of society supported by all making one feel safe in your hover bed at night knowing that huge quantities of frivolous resource wasting adrenaline junkies are standing guard? No, it's more like a remake of a classic rock tune during which the original band takes the stage and then proceeds to take a whizz whilst spinning in a circular pattern like a planetary orbit (Star Trek Into Darkness Spoiler!).

  I was thrilled that Benedict Cumberbatch (from Sherlock TV series) was going to be in the movie but he's cleverly disturbing character to decipher, not at all like his version of Sherlock character he does so well - because there is a point when you sympathize with him but he turns around and does something truly evil.  You don't know what to expect from him.  I don't want to give away too much but there are shocking bits.  A lot of action and explosive scenes throughout but a warning for parents - *spoiler alert - I was a little shocked <winced> when Khan kills Peter Weller's character Admiral Marcus with his bare hands.  A little too brutal for any kids watching, I practically looked away myself.  If you know it's coming... you'll know when you see it.
  I was disturbed a little after that and how would they cope when a main-character dies - I'm not saying who dies only that it's not Spock.  The ending was predictable once you figured out where the plot was going but it leaves an opening later for Khan's return in future.

This is a ""you've come a long way baby"" since the original star Trek, and yet it is amazing how much our descendents take on our mannerisms.  I admit it was a bit disconcerting finding a youth acting much like the original cast, but grandchildren and children are like that, as much as they don't want to admit it.

5293718,5,B009934S5M,"Just like the first new and re-booted Trek movie, I liked this one more than I expected to.  The acting was very good, the special effects were absolutely spectacular (even on the small screen), and the script was quite well done.  It made me wish I had gotten to see it on the big screen, but...oh well.  This way I can watch it again and again on my blu-ray.

Just like the first movie, this one pays homage to original Trek, but without going overboard on it.  That can be quite the feat and, so far, they are managing it very well indeed.  The familiar relationships between the main characters are there, all the affection and teasing, even if they are being played by new actors and there are occasional twists that we never saw in original Trek...but were sometimes hinted at.  You never know when an old name (with a new face) will appear and it keeps you guessing--are they the same as what we've seen before, or will they turn out to have a very different role in things.  I really do enjoy the alternate universe they are exploring in this series.

I am especially enjoying the new (old) McCoy and a very sassy and spitfire Uhura.  Hey, we always knew she had it in her!  Kirk is wild and footloose in his personal life and yet dedicated to his ship and his crew.  Once again, some things never change...for good reason.  Spock...well, some part of me will always see Leonard Nimoy, but the actor we see in this series is definitely growing on me.  I really like the new Scotty; we get to see much more of the humor in his character, even as he is still a genius with engines.

The movie opens with Kirk having been demoted for one of the issues he was always getting into on old Trek--playing fast and loose with the Prime Directive.  I guess some things never change.  However, nothing keeps Jim down long...because soon Star Fleet needs him again once they are under attack by a brilliant and dangerous man who is out to destroy them.  Kirk and the Enterprise are sent to bring back this criminal from no less than the Klingon homeworld, where any mis-step could result in war between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.  Can anyone see what is coming next?

I won't give away any of the plot twists and secrets, but this one definitely will bring back old memories and revisit them in a new way.  I found myself crying ONCE AGAIN...THANKS!  Still and all, I think this movie will please both the old and new generations of Trek fans.  I look forward to another movie and what they will do in the future.

5293723,5,B009934S5M,This movie was well worth the wait.  The writers haven't lost site of the original story line of the set down By Jean Roddenberry,1379462400,,129,4.375
5293724,3,B009934S5M,"Viewers of STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS will probably fall into three categories: those who love it, those who hate it, and those who have very mixed feelings about it. And there will probably be many reasons for this, although one of the major reasons will be the degree of affection and loyalty a viewer feels for the original series and the movies that included the original cast members, especially THE WRATH OF KHAN.

To me, one of the few ""bright spots"" in this often lame action film was the brief cameo appearance of Leonard Nimoy as Old Spock talking with Young Spock. To me and to several fellow Trekkies who are between 50 and 80, the original characters, played by the original cast, had great ""charm"" and ""warmth."" This new cast, to us, for the most part is cartoony and is doing a moderately competent parody of the originals. Try as some of us do, we just can't buy their performances, can't take them seriously, because they haven't grown on us over a series of years, even decades. And if any were to die - as we thought Spock had ""really"" died in THE WRATH OF KHAN - we would not feel real grief and sorrow and pity for these newbies, as we did for the original Spock and Kirk and the others.

Watching this film, I felt ""removed"" from it emotionally; it was a visual and intellectual experience with all the ""caring"" about the characters drained out. I could appreciate the ""cleverness"" of several special effects and several allusions the original series, and I could bet myself that X or Y or Z would be the way the script-writer would get the characters out of predicaments A, B, and C ... and 95 percent of the time I guessed right, which made me feel ""smart"" but also disappointed me that the script was so weak that even I (in my mid-70s) could predict virtually every plot twist at least ten minutes in advance.

In the last half of this film, I sensed that parts of one major confrontation were deliberately parallel to recent and current Hawk-vs.-Dove foreign policy disputes in the U.S., and I was disappointed by the stereotyped shallowness and blatant dishonesty of one of those sides in this film. While I agreed with the point being made, I wished the characters had been given more depth and better lines - and that the ""solution"" had been more imaginative than the violent beat-down killing we see.

I viewed STAR TREK: IN DARKNESS with a very disgusted Trekkie who thought this film was a ""desecration"" of the ""already perfect"" Khan story and who, at the end, rated it ""F-"". I myself rated it ""C-"", and we briefly argued about my ""high"" rating.

Then I made a little pun that made that person lighten up: I said, ""It has some SUCK without much SESS."" Then I amended this to ""It was rather SUCK-CESSPOOL."" And then we agreed that we would not watch this film again.",1379462400,2,2796,4.528712871287128

However having some affinity to the original characters I have mixed feelings about the new franchise. As fun summer movies they are great. I don't know if they stand up quite as well to the richer story lines of the old Wrath of Kahn and Voyage Home. But they are at least equal to the Undiscovered Country and surpass probably all the other Trek films.

The reason I can only give three stars is primarily comparisons on the characters. And, trying to avoid any spoilers, the reintroduction of such an iconic story line just didn't seem to be called for this early in the reboot life cycle. Regarding the characters, it seems that Abrams characters border on parody of the originals. Chris Pine seems to have some moments of gravity and some of his frat boyish persona may be a result of this being a younger, brasher Kirk, perhaps updating the Jame T of the original series, but pretty sophmoric when compared to the Kirk in movies 2,4,and to some extent 6. Zachary Quinto seems to be just be mimicking Spock, versus Nimoy who I think really defined and owned the role. Bones is great and spot on, but Scotty and Checkov are really on the parody side of things. The Zoe Saldia's Uhura is an interesting twist, and while I'm a fan of hers, the character just seems somewhat forced. Sulu is sort of set dressing. Last and maybe least, why does Abrams think a starships engine room needs to look like a factory? In the first movie I think he used a brewery for a set, and while he used a tech lab for part of this one, the industrial setting in other scenes just seems out of place.

Now for this movie, again avoiding spoilers, while interesting to see this plot line rebooted. the movie looks great, it flows very well and it's a fun couple hours, with some decent acting and a few thoughtful scenes.  But all of the symbolism and depth of it's source material seem forced now. The characters are too young in their relationships for this to have the impact it did a couple decades ago. That said, it's a fun ride. I just think there could have been more to this story, without giving up the action portions. However a couple of the iconic lines that were sort of redistributed in this movie for me fell flat. If you know nothing of the old universe I don't think it will matter.

All in all, a good movie, probably better if you don't know the source material. For long time Trek folks who have heard of the connections to the past here, I have to think this will come off as disappointing. I think JJ's fun reboots will be well suited for the Star Wars franchise which was always meant as space opera, and I thank him for reinvigorting my beloved Trek, but would be nice to see if the next caretaker could add some depth. It doesn't have to go full Battlestar Galactica dark and drama, but still...you think Ronald Moore might be interested?

5293757,2,B009934S5M,"So before I begin, this is just a movie and nobody really dies. Opinions are not deadly and mine won't kill anyone. That said, I have a real problem with this film, the whole reboot and the last few Star Trek movies in general.

First the movie. It was successful and is maybe the highest grossing Star Trek movie in the series (though not in the US and maybe due to higher ticket prices). That does not mean it was a good film, just an entertaining one. Good for the studio for delivering what the public wants. But in this case it seems the public wants very little. The recipe goes like this, some attractive and currently popular actors, an action filled storyline than has them flaunting the establishment and achieving success against overwhelming odds. 10 minutes of plot, an hour and a half of soon to be forgotten breathtaking special effects. The TV episode that spawned this movie had more depth.

Overlooking the simple fact that the original this is based on, The Wrath of Khan, was a much better film, (it was probably the best of all the Star Trek films so no shame there), there is the same stupid script elements that the last film had that could easily have been fixed to make this a better movie. Did anyone wince at one of the final scenes where Kirk, among very sensitive technology, adjusted the engine energy sources by kicking it in place. I'm sure that final kick was just the precision adjustment the mechanism needed. It's with the same sledge hammer precision that the whole movie is constructed.

But rather than dwelling on every little plot misstep or mistake, I would like to discuss a greater problem. There are a lot of space opera movies and series out there. There was really only one thing that made Star Trek unique and that was Roddenberry's vision on a hopeful future in which humans had finally learned to get along in a society of true equality. It was during the late sixties when Star Trek was born. There was the war in Vietnam (much worse than Afghanistan and Iraq)that had this country divided and calling returning servicemen ""Baby Burners"". Our troops returning home from a hell you can't imagine were not celebrated but spat upon. There was a draft that saw worried parents bidding their sons farewell. There was a crisis of belief in our democratic way of life as very public officials were caught doing illegal things. There was rioting on campuses by disenchanted students. Civil rights leaders were being killed and the middle east started it's first oil embargo.

It was during this setting that Roddenberry launched a series about the future that told us that there was a future that held hope. That we would solve these problems and go on to a bright future. And the episodes had us encountering new life forms and solving their problems with our unique human perspective that we had so painfully evolved into after so many years of trials and tribulations. Roddenberry offered us a vision of our future that spawned hope and provoked thought. He had ground breaking episodes like one showing the absurdity of racism where the two antagonists were half black and white but on different sides of their faces. Their legacy from this racial hatred was a world in ruins.

While there is nothing wrong with Into Darkness as an entertainment piece, it's a shame that so much of it's pedigree and uniqueness has been stripped down to this derivative and mindless eye candy form of entertainment.

At some point while I was watching the endless special effects that took the place of storyline I felt I was in another movie, Idiocracy, and I was watching the film that won the Academy Award in that movie. I hate to think that Idiocracy's vision of the future is the one that comes true.",1379462400,4,3736,4.670212765957447

I think they tried too hard and though I saw the original Wrath of Khan back in the day at a drive in movie theater and don't remember too much of it, I know it was better than this. The actor who plays Khan in this version (his name escapes me at the moment) was certainly menacing, but I found him to be pretty much a one-note character. I've not seen him in other stuff so I don't know if this was his choice or the director's, but I wasn't impressed. If there is another I hope more thought is put into not trying to make it 'bigger and better' than the first, but to make a quality movie.

After establishing the alternate reality plot device that enabled the filmmakers to have the lovable, mostly well cast...cast of characters we've come to love, have all new adventures, did the filmmakers offer up a new, original adventure??? The answer is a highly dissappointed ""NO""! What a lackluster Star Trek! I think most of the good reviews are from those under 35. This one is about as good as Nemesis, but not quite. The music wasn't memorable, heck nothing in this movie was memorable. I felt like I was watching every other movie, except the one I was watching. Avatar, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan- the bad remake, among others. What a waste of time, money, and Leonard Nimoy! How does Khan turn from a Spanish/middle Easterner with a believable strengh into a pale, British, Marvel comic book character? How does Carol Marcus have a British accent? They take direct lines and scenes from ""The Wrath Of Khan"" switch the roles around and call it something new? LAME, Lame, lame! Its now obvious Chris Pine is badly miscast, and its time to recast Uhura with a younger actress (Zoe Saldana is not aging as well as Nichelle Nichols did, she looks hungover and half asleep throughout) Its also time to abandon the Spock/Uhura romance, it just doesn't work.

This Star Trek is a variation on that movie but in my opinion, not anywhere near as good. Granted this version has better special effects and graphics and realism but the story is poor, the acting is dull and at times the movie just drags. There are parts of this movie that were obviously added as filler and dull.
If you are a die hard Star Trek fan then you will probably like this movie but the first one with Chris Pine was much better and enjoyable, this one was somewhat boring and predictable.
I've seen every episode of the original Star Trek TV series and every Star Trek movie. This is not the worst of the Star Trek movies, the one with Picard and Kirk was the worst. Do I regret seeing this movie, not at all as I streamed it and it was cheap and worth watching at that price, just glad I did not go to the movies to see it.
If the only Star Trek movies you have seen was the last one with Pine and if you enjoyed that one, you will enjoy this one. If you have seen all the movies (like I have) then you might still enjoy this one but don't expect it to be of the same intense level as ""Wrath of Khan"" was.",1379376000,7,1215,4.004115226337449

I don't know, maybe they were going for an irony story, that the alternate timeline played out in almost the exact same way.  I just know I've never watched a movie before with the line ""you've GOT to be kidding me!"" running through my head so much.

I scored it 3/5 because as a stand-alone movie it's actually pretty good.  As someone who has seen Wrath of Khan I'm considering dumping it in the trash.  Whoever the writer for Wrath of Khan was should seriously consider a plagiarism lawsuit; it's seriously pathetic.  The moment Spock was screaming ""KHAN!"" I finally gave up on this movie.  Unbelievable.  I've seen remakes and sequels try to cash in on their predecessors but this is a whole new level of plain reeking of trying to just replicate something else.

I own all the Star Trek motion pictures on Blu-ray, both the Kirk and Picard versions, and have watched all of the others that are readily available on DVD or Netflix streaming.  I'm not Trekie enough to dress up or attend conventions, but I enjoy and admire the series, especially the historical continuity all the series tried hard to maintain.  J. J. Abrams has done some very fine film work, but his two CGI infested rapes of the Star Trek saga will never be find a place on my shelf.

Had I never watched a moment of the Rodenberry and Rodenberry-inspired Star Trek saga, I would grant both films, at best, three stars and describe them as grossly over-CGIed and aimed at an audience without much of an attention span.  In other words, par for the Hollywood course.  But I have seen Rodenberry's work and those he inspired.  Even when he was bound and gagged by minuscule budget constraints everything on the original series, he did it so much better and with brain fully engaged.

Both of Abrams' alternative versions destroy the history the various Star Trek series carefully constructed and maintained throughout a variety of series:  The destruction of Vulcan in the first film retained here; the out-of-character love interest between Spock and Uhura; the death of Christopher Pike that negates the original pilot later woven into a two-part story in the original series; an Enterprise bridge that looks nothing like the original; the frenetic behavior of every character except Spock that is nothing like the original characterizations (and this film ends where the TV series began); Carol Marcus's English accent in this film even though she was a an all-American girl in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn.  And speaking of Kahn, Into Darkness is in part a mirror-image recycle of Star Trek II's conclusion.  (Really uncreative, J. J.  I saw it coming a mile away.)  Benedict Cumberbatch is a fine actor and suitably maniacal as Kahn, but he makes a better Sherlock Holmes where he can display a range of emotion.  Here, he is as expressionless as a statue, no doubt at Abrams' direction.  Ricardo Montelban brought so much more flair to the character - twice.  And I here enter a plea to all film makers to stop asking the human body to survive unscathed the physically impossible.  You don't need science fiction for that.  Watch any James Bond film.

At the end of the film, I hoped mightily the Enterprise would burn up in Earth's atmosphere, take all its hyperactive characters with it, and end this series so Gene Rodenberry could rest peacefully in his grave.

We all watched the original series, the next generation, voyager... etc.  Rather than relive the past over and over and over again, what we have is something new.

The story had way more action than character developement but I guess that is due to the status quo these days in film making. Roddenberry was WAAAAAAAAAY into character developement. Just look at TNG, Voyager or DS9 to see my point. In those series he cared much more about us ""knowing"" the characters than actual story lines although the creative genius of the plots was never lacking. Gene was also resolute about the prime directive which both versions of Kirk ignore (esp the new version). Picard would rather die than ""bend"" it.

5293777,3,B009934S5M,"**This review contains several spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, be warned.**

My husband and I ordered this movie with great trepidation due to an intense dislike of a many things in the first movie.  However, we decided to give this second movie a try as word of mouth was that it was much better.  It was and it wasn't.  Two of the major issues we had with the first movie were even more annoying in this movie.  Surprisingly, some of the casting choices we did not like in the first movie improved greatly in this one.

What we loved:

Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan.  Truly awesome and amazing.  He radiated menace and was utterly believable as this most famous of Star Trek villains.  I actually liked his version of Khan over Ricardo Montalbn's in many ways, meaning no insult to the late and beloved Mr. Montalbn.  The elegance and barely leashed menace that Benedict Cumberbatch brought to the role just took my breath away.  Plus the action scenes finally gave us a look at why the genetically engineered were so feared and why genetic manipulation was banned after the Eugenics War.  I cannot compliment him enough on his performance and I am now going to look into other works that he has been in.

Chris Pine as Kirk.  I kind of liked him in the first movie but really learned to love him in this one.  He has matured as an actor and seems more comfortable in the role of Kirk.  This is not William Shatner's Kirk, this is Chris Pine's Kirk and I approve of how he has made the character his own.  And Kirk sacrificing himself for his crew, totally believable.  Loved how and why he did it.

Karl Urban as McCoy.  Loved him in the first movie, loved him in this movie.  I've been a fan of Karl Urban since his days in Hercules and Xena and have never been disappointed with him in any movie or tv show I've seen him in.  There is no one who could have embraced the role of McCoy as well as he did.  My only complaint in regards to him is that there wasn't more McCoy.

Bruce Greenwood as Christopher Pike.  He owned the role and his death brought tears to my eyes.

Simon Pegg as Scotty.  I've never liked any of the movies Simon Pegg's been in though I did like him as Scotty in the first movie.  However, in this movie, I officially am now a fan and most definitely love him as Scotty.  He's made Scotty his own and you can believe that this is our beloved miracle worker.

Anton Yelchin as Chekhov was again likeable and enjoyable.

John Cho was actually good this time around.  Hated him with a passion in the first movie as he seemed so wooden and phoning it in.  This time around we got to see him actually enjoy his role and he did well.

Alice Eve as Carol Marcus.  The beautiful Ms. Eve fits well into the cast and she did well in the story.  Have been a fan since Men in Black 3 and look forward to seeing her in future movies.

Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus.  It's Peter Weller for goodness sake, what's not to like?  Crazy and very evil, a perfect villain.

What we hated:

Look, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's a....pregnant guppy?  What was J.J. Abrams smoking when he had them design the Enterprise as such a hideous parody?  Hated it in the first movie, despised it in this movie and was hoping that it was going away and they were going to redesign it after all the damage. But nope, ugly pregnant guppy lives...unfortunately.  And hey, it must be the guppy genes in the ship that allows it to go underwater.  Seriously?  Underwater?

Zachary Quinto as Emo-Spock.  Shoot me now.  Loved Zachary Quinto as Sylar in Heroes.  Hate Zachary Quinto in the hot mess that he has made out of Spock.  How can someone who made such a truly evil, psychotic and menacing villain who was usually cold and in control in Sylar then make our beloved Vulcan into a intolerably whiny, often wooden and lost looking twit like Emo-Spock.  Usually the first thing people I know universally say they hate about this and the first movie is Emo-Spock.  Too bad Kirk saved his life.  You know, when Spock is somehow able to withstand being literally on top of the lava inside an active volcano.  That is definitely some awesome technology that allows a person to be right there in the volcano literally right next to the lava and live yet cannot protect the non-living shuttle which was not right next to the lava but a distance above.  Right.  Uh huh.

Zoe Saldana as Uhura.  Hey, let's inappropriately grope and kiss Emo-Spock while on duty, constantly.  Hey, let's let the communications officer beam down to help her whiny boyfriend beat up the villain, cause that's always believable.  The Enterprise doesn't need security guards, just Uhura, cause she is just that cool.  Not.  Ms. Saldana, while quite lovely, is just so over the top and unprofessional as Uhura she is like fingernails on a chalkboard.  The ""romance"" between Emo-Spock and Uhura is so forced and unbelievable it boggles the mind.

Chekhov as the army swiss knife of officers.  Love the character, always enjoyed the humor of, ""...it was a Russian invention..."" aspect of Chekhov.  Like the actor who plays Chekhov.  Cannot believe for one minute that you would let your Chief Engineer resign and instead of promoting one of the numerous Starfleet engineers onboard to acting Chief Engineer, you assign...the navigator.  Yep.  Let's not let someone who spent years training to be an engineer do the job, let's let the navigator do it.  Obviously Starfleet needs better training if the best person for the position of Chief Engineer is not someone who works in engineering.

Emo-Spock's ""Khannnnnnnnnnn"" after Kirk dies.  Gag.  Overact much?  Have I mentioned I viscerally hate Emo-Spock?

McCoy channeling Dr. Mengele.  Exactly why would McCoy (a) have a dead tribble and (b) inject it with the villain's blood?  That's just ewww, oh so creepy.  Not that both my husband and I didn't immediately think, ""Oh hey, I bet Khan's blood will be important later on in the movie and that it's going to bring that tribble and someone else back to life.  Nah, no one would telegraph a plot element like that cause that would be lazy writing.  But wait a minute, didn't Khan's blood do miraculous things at the beginning of the movie for that little girl also?  Nah, must be a coincidence.""

Overall, a fairly fun but flawed movie.  Just ignore the entire beginning sequence on the primitives' planet, Emo-Spock, and Uhura and the movie becomes rather enjoyable.",1379376000,2,6436,4.571929824561403
5293778,5,B009934S5M,"Star Trek: Into Darkness Bowling for Movie Score - 299.25 of 300 (WOWZA, that's nearly a perfect score!)

Hello out there in Amazon land - this is a kind of special Bowling for Movies Review.  As some of you doubtless know, I have been using my totally unique and completely un-patentable mixture of old technology, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and quasi/pseudo-science to rate and score movies.  Basically, the idea is I rate and score movies from the vantage point of The Regular Dudes of the world - something I find missing in other for pay services or the so called ""movie critic"" professionals.  Frankly, who you gonna believe - some out of touch guy who gets paid per word or me, just your average dude who watches too many movies?  Hey, they may be able to claim themselves as ""experts"" but experts at what I ask you.  Now me, I just have access to hundreds and hundreds of movies across all formats and genres and a deep love of hearing myself talk... basically the only two things one might need to give an accurate view if you will, of Hollywood magic - and all conveniently laid out for you, dear Amazon review reader, in an easy to interpret format - the humble bowling score.  Furthermore, the system can be trusted because it literally has nothing to do with actual bowling (and isn't that just great for your peace of mind or POM for those into the whole brevity thing).

Now while I have a sort of template I generally use when writing movie reviews when a movie is a true gem (and let me assure you, this movie IS A PURE AND TRUE GEM) I have vowed to write a completely new review.  While the review is a one of a kind, the system is not - a bowling score of 108 would be considered, eh - it was ok; while a 192 would truly be a good movie - one you might recommend to friends; now crack 200 and you've got something - and by thunder - this be one heck of a great popcorn movie.

Star Trek: Into Darkness - we own the super cool 3D Blu Ray with official Starfleet phaser version (I added a picture to the `customer images') - seriously people if you don't have a 3D TV, get one - it seriously ramps up the OMG factor and why else would you watch a movie if not for the OMG factor?

What's the movie about?
(Ok, I am gonna try my best here to give you what you need without spoiling any of the good parts, so bear with me here.)

When questionable judgment leads the crew of the Enterprise into some ""oops, did I do that?"" kind of trouble (prime directive, prime smekertive, oh, wait, you're serious) Jim Kirk loses his beloved Enterprise and is busted down to commander.  Meanwhile, there is trouble afoot when a top secret installation laying hidden in plain sight as a library is blown up in the WAY TO COOL FOR SCHOOL looking London (circa 2259) Starfleet gathers its best and brightest - only to have them blown away at the hands of the mysterious John Harrison - yup, you guessed it, the same dude responsible for blowing up the building in London town.  It's up to Kirk and crew to put an end to this renegade's shenanigans, uncover the mystery of Section 31, get a good look at J.J. Abrams version of what a Klingon looks like, and find out what the Enterprise is really made of.  WOW, trying NOT to give away anything is not as easy as it would seem.  People, there are some SERIOUS twists and turns along the way and at least one OOOH MMMY GOOODDDD moment... I had 3 of those myself, but individual results may vary.

Why I loved this movie so much:
<> Total popcorn movie - action, adventure, comedy, good friends, tonight is kind of special sort of movie that keep me going from beginning to end - there was no `heavy, middle of the movie' type dialog quagmire - the movie just spilled from one scene to the next without slowing down
<> The special effects were simply put - amazing.  So often with CGI-dependent movies the action on screen comes off as cartoonish (at best) which can really negate the viewer's immersion, not the case here; I am for positive that the 3D helped out in this department as space debris littered my living room, spears whizzed by my head, and you could see to infinity (maybe even beyond) which really ramped up the feeling that you were genuinely in space
<> While it is this Movie Dude's opinion that The Prime Directive is simply awesome (I mean really, how many of the world's ills could have been avoided if one culture didn't try to change, covert, or otherwise ""make better, for your own good"" anyone else's culture); Gene Roddenberry was a true hero and humanitarian way back in the 60's when he created a show which featured such novel ideas as equality of the races, the abolishment of nationalism in favor of a worldview without borders, and a `hands off' to cultural conversions by way of respectful intellectual tolerance
<> The blending of old Star Trek mythos into a new Star Trek package... dude, you have NO IDEA how bad I want to just tell you what happens but that would be SPOILING the movie for you, trust The Movie Dude here - they did just that and they did it well
<> The script feature some wonderful interplay between the core characters of Kirk, Spock, and Uhura which further developed the characters in a significantly more intimate way not previously seen in any other franchise offering

Why I didn't give the movie a perfect score:
<> It just missed a perfect score for a few small reasons - first, the villain in our story, while wonderfully acted by Benedict Cumberbatch (say that three times fast with crackers in your mouth), true Trekkies may stumble on the apparent `whitewashing' of the character
<> I may be alone in this but - ever since the Terror Attacks of 9/11, Hollywood has seemed completely and overtly obsessed with producing films which show the utter annihilation of skyscrapers, usually in some dramatic collapse - enough is enough already, move on to some other disasters will you Hollywood... will ya?

Beyond that, dude, I seriously have NOTHING to complain about.  The movie had a quick pace, a solid (if slightly predictable) plot, all the action and adventure you could shake a stick at (which I can shake a stick at quite a lot), all the love interests, scandals, blowing stuff up, Star Ships battling it out, and a gratuitous scene with a blond in her underwear one Movie Dude could ask for... kudos to you Mr. Abrams, kudos to you.

Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews. Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",1379376000,26,6851,4.4292527821939585

5293787,4,B009934S5M,"I really enjoyed this recent Trek film.

There is some character development, but it seemed to me the producers/writers were pulling the same plot devices from the first reboot, thinly disguised as something new. I know a lot of Trek fans argument about every TOS/TMP and even TNG cliche crammed into this movie; not too mention the odious TWOK references. Overall it's an enjoyable ride, but that's not what my gripe is about...

When I pre-ordered this DVD, I expected the extra feature we're going to be included on the DVD format. Instead, I got a barebones DVD with just the feature film, and a bunch of commercial and previews for crap I could care less about. The original price was $32 USD, then dropped to $29, then to $14 by CBS/Paramount. So if I want to see the extras, I have to buy the Blu-Ray/DVD combo, really?

Why did the marketing eggheads decide to do this mid-stream is beyond me? Not all of us own a Blu-Ray player, so why would I have to buy a combo pack, spending money on a disk I can't even use? Marketing choices like this, are a turn off at best.",1379376000,,1074,4.414141414141414

5293789,4,B009934S5M,"While not perfect, I did enjoy this new version of Star Trek (as well as its 2009 predecessor).  I found that the actors portray the original characters very well, convincingly capturing their personalities and appearance while, at the same time, making them their own.
What particularly helps is that I view these as I complete reboot, and in no way try to tie this into the original Trek universe (despite old Spoke's involvement).  (To me, trying to link these to the old series is as crazy as trying to link the Dark Knight saga to the old Tim Burton Batman movies.)
The other is being honest. Let's face it, the original Star Trek movies were a mixed bag. Half were really good (2,4,6) and half stank (1,3,5). Nor were they as deep as people would like to believe. Yes they spoke of high minded ideals (most that would never work in real life - such as the idea that all mankind simply works for the mutual benefit of society, obeying their superiors with a smile, and with no thought of personal gain other than the satisfaction of a job well done), but in the end, a lot came down to who had the superior firepower/military tactics anyway. (Oh, and to those that claim that this movie is not Sci-Fi because to is not focused on the technology, the tech described in TOS, and especially TNG, was nothing but techno-babble.)
This movie, as its predecessor, was a fun action flick that paid homage to an enjoyable franchise that was fun to watch, but should never have been taken as seriously as it has been.
There are a few concerns with this movie, however, especially for parents who are wandering if they should let their children watch. There is one completely pointless scene of Kirk in bed with two lady aliens (it's only purpose, I suppose, is to reinforce the notion that he's a lady's man - which is shown easily enough with the way Kirk is distracted by anyone walking by with a skirt), and a scene in which Carol Marcus strips down to her underwear (the only purpose seeming to be to show off Alice Eve in as little as possible). Because of these two scenes, though rather brief, I find the movie to be less than suitable for impressionable children.
** Possible spoiler **
My only other real criticism of the film is the beginning portion with the sick child. I know it was to foreshadow the effects of Khan's blood, but the somber tone of those scenes felt completely out of place with the rest of the movie, especially since it tries to pull the heartstrings for a little girl that is never again seen in the movie.",1379376000,,2534,4.506521739130434
5293790,4,B009934S5M,"If you liked the first movie, this one will be a treat.  Khan's character was well-executed as a villain and the chemistry between Spok and Captain Kirk was as good as ever.",1379376000,,173,4.40625

5293795,4,B009934S5M,"I have been a life long trekkie and have given Mr Abrams et al the benefit of the doubt and taken his films on their own merits and thoroughly enjoyed both thus far. Yes one or two points have been an irritant to the purist in my opinion but I have enjoyed the fact that these films are set in an alternate timeline and enjoy them for the value that they contribute to Trek in total and remember that they are keeping Trek alive for us all to enjoy. As for the Bluray and phaser set, I was concerned reading some negative comments regarding the quality of the build of the phaser replica, because to be honest, that was the main reason for my ordering from Amazon and not waiting an extra week for the NZ release. I am happy to say that the quality of the phaser that I received was excellent and up to the same standard as the previous QMX phaser released after the 2009 film, so I assume that unfortunately there are some faulty replicas that have slipped through quality control. Over all as a customer I am very pleased with the Amazon service, the packaging was well done and the package arrived on my doorstep half a world away from origin point well ahead of the promised deadline, well done Amazon, thank you.",1379376000,,1217,4.342105263157895

Yep it is fun at times, nice special effects the acting is okay the script....well it is lets just leave it at not very good.  As far as working as a Trek movie not at all. It does have a few genuine Trek moments in it but not many.  Yes I understand it is a reboot.  I even had high hopes for this one as the first movie opened up some real possibilities.  This movie squandered the opportunity to do something special in favour of pandering to the simplest of movie patrons.  Worth a look if you are not Trek fan just for the pretty colours.  If you are a Star Trek fan still worth a look,  BUT be warned!  You will find yourself cringing a few times as you watch this.",1379289600,3,851,4.134146341463414

One is the quality of the phaser replica varies a lot between units. Many people have returned it a couple of times to get a good one. There is warping and chipping reported. Mine was OK though not perfect but I won't be returning it to the US.

The second is the UV (Ultraviolet) Digital copy that supposedly comes with this release. This is not redeemable outside of the US. This is a rip-off and was not mentioned anywhere in the advertising for this product. They wonder why people download pirate copies.",1379289600,,681,4.619834710743802

5293806,5,B009934S5M,"Yes, I say it, knowing how much flak I'm probably gonna get, also I've seen the 2nd-4th, 7th, 8th & 11th movies. It left me in awe, with how well it was written, acted, & directed. The only thing that could make it better, is an extra scene depicting Spock, Uhura, & Kahn beaming back up to the Enterprise after Spock knocks Kahn out, they rush him to sick bay, they unfreeze Kirk, take a sample of blood from Kahn, made the serum he did, injected it into Kirk, refroze Kahn, then faded into black with Spock asking if Kirk were all right & Bones answering ""we'll see,"" & we be given some indication of Kirk being revived, then we see Kirk in the med bay on Earth. Other than that, it's perfect. I was laughing for the 1st part of this movie, with all its jokes (Chekov being told to put on a red shirt) & possible callbacks to the original timeline (Wrath of Kahn, DS9, TOS, etc). Then s*** got real pretty quick & I enjoyed the hell out of the movie.
Now, for those that might complain about it not being perfect, what size stick is up your ass?
Possible topics for why you'd probably be mad;
1. It takes from Wrath of Kahn.
It parallels Wrath of Kahn, not steals from it. They even remind older fans of that movie, with Leonard Nimoy as original Spock, telling his younger alternate self about it. Also, what was Kirk supposed to do about the Enterprise, huh? Let it crash on Earth & have most to every person die on impact? No, he's James T. Kirk, he's not gonna let the Enterprise get destroyed, he's gonna save it no matter what.
2. Benedict Cumberbatch is white & British.
Kahn, being revived by admiral Marcus, could've been given plastic surgery, as well as an alias & his skin could've paled from being frozen for too long. As to why he's British instead of Hispanic in his accent, got me. His performance tells you he's a worthy successor to the original actor in every way, for the most part.
3. Spock gets too emotional
It's been almost 50 years of seeing Spock be as Vulcan & emotionless as possible. This alternate version of him has had s*** thrown at him since the last movie, where he lost his planet & mom. In this, he's sort of started adapting to human culture on Earth; starting to get jokes, insults, etc that are thrown at him, which his original self would've let fly over his pointed-eared head. He's also been bested by an equally inelegant adversary to himself, who's helped kill his friend & he feels the need to avenge him. So much, that he lets his Vulcan-fueled emotions run wild, as he chases Kahn down the streets & in the air in California, besting Kahn, only to be stopped when Uhura, his girlfriend in this timeline, tells him to stop because they need him to save Kirk. I feel his emotional release is perfectly called for, since now we see why Vulcans can't/shouldn't be allowed to express their emotions freely & regularly.

Overall, I find this movie great, as long as you're like me & feel that every era in Star Trek has their merits on their own & should only be judged upon the era it belongs to. Hope you found this at least slightly helpful in at least seeing this movie at least once, which I suggest you do, to see if you at least like it.

I'm more into the movies than the special features usually anyway, so I don't care much either way there.

 So....  the phaser you ask? It's pretty darn awesome. I had already read the reviews posted here, and agree that perhaps it could have been put together a bit better, but fortunately my copy is definitely acceptable. In fact, I'm really psyched about it. The parts line up well enough unless you get really nit picky about it. The paint looks good, no obvious runs or drips. Feels nice in your hand, and sits in it's stand perfectly. The barrel doesn't spin all the way around freely as mentioned by other reviews, but the two tips can be set straight in front and stay there nicely. I'm glad I read the negative reviews, because that way I was expecting much worse.... This thing is primarily a display/prop model after all. What else are you going to actually do with it?

The plot of this movie is a typical plot development.  Did you know that in the past few years Hollywood has been relying on writing academies to write scripts.  The plots are so cookie cutter, losing originality, and constantly putting in the same plot elements repeatedly.  I do not like the movies coming out of Hollywood because they seem so dry in imagination.  Where are the days when movies were inspired by great authorship and imagination.  Has Hollywood dried up in truly imaginative films because their audience is willing to be entertained by simplistic stories.  We need a more thoughtful art form not a reliance on the easy, lazy content.  My favorite Science Fiction movie is the 'The Forbidden Planet'.  The technical sets may seem rather old fashion, but the plot is fascinating.  'The Forbidden Planet' is still rated for 5 stars.",1379289600,2,977,5.0062111801242235

I won't mention how that came about because it would be a spoiler for those not having seen the first installment, Star Trek Take Command.  These two movies with fresh young actors open up a whole new universe to explore because the time line differential.

5293853,2,B009934S5M,"All the complaints on the extras is pathetic. Lets talk about the movie itself. (MAYBE SOME SPOILERS). I am a die hard fan of all the movies and shows including TOS. The movie was great entertainment, great special affects, all actors did a well as expected job.
  Story direction: I am a little disappointed in the direction this story went or is going. I know there are dozens of storys to be used even from TOS that were never made into shows. Why remake a whole movie? Especially one that was probably the most successful? Its one thing to tweak threads from different storys but to rearrange and retell an entire movie and story line....I really expected more from Abrams. The movie was extremely fast paced and barely any time for any substantial dialogue. It teetered on the edge of lacking substance. The growing bond with Kirk/Spock/McCoy. I'm not saying I didn't like the movie but it seems they tried to pack so much into the movie it was busting at the seams with any and every tid bit of information of TOS history, including using old lines (some re-worded) from the original series or previous movies from the old cast. I think its ok to resemble some lines etc but don't just throw them in there just to have them in there. I do like the way Marcus and Nurse Chapel were brought into the story, very clever.
  Characters: Dr. McCoy--What was bothersome were the amount of cliched analogy's they had Dr. McCoy spouting off. At one point in the movie Spock said, ""enough already with the analogy's"". That was amusing but it was no longer amusing when they had McCoy continue doing these analogy's, in fact I would say JJ Abrams was on the edge of ""SPOOFING"" the good doctor. McCoy had very little insightful or useful dialogue throughout the whole movie. That was disappointing. We all love McCoy's attitude and sarcasm with Kirk and Spock, but they really wore it to death with every one liner cliche they could pack in there. McCoy deserves better than that.
  Spock: Although Zachary Quinto does a great job with Spock, the Spock character it seems has been softened for lack of better words. And what about this fling he has with Uhura? Pryor story? Originally written? I don't know, but it makes Spock a bit of a pansy, instead of a level headed Vulcan always in control. And what about ""PON FAR""? I guess that's out the window now? I'm just not buyng this fling with Uhura. This movie had moments where he was indecisive and unsure of himself. That's not the Spock we know from past, even the young Spock from past. True he was young and still learning to cope with his human side. But if he wasn't in control as a Vulcan should be then he probably wasn't ready for life in general much less being a Star Fleet officer.
  Uhura: Great job by the actress but they have her character very lax & emotional, its not complimentary of a StarFleet officer nor to the original Uhura character. Scotty, Chekov and Sulu all do well and their characters flow well in these new movies.
  Kirk: Chris Pine does as well as expected on Kirk. Maybe just a little bit too lax in his command. I realize this is young Kirk and he is learning who he is. But even a young Kirk would actually command more respect than an older Kirk who's been around the block.
  Kahn: This guy did OK job, but he lacked the strong screen presence even the older Kahn gave us. Obviously no one can match Ricardo Montalban but if you cant find someone with equally or more  powerful substance on the screen, then don't do it at all. Even Kahn's character deserved some one better.
  Bottom Line: The movie is entertaining and very watchable. Although it is a remake of an older one, they did change it up enough to keep you guessing. But it wasn't enough to cover my disappointment of trying to do the remake in the first place. I am concerned on where Abrams is going with these characters. My other concern is ending up with a bunch of remakes of movies from the 80""s. These movies will stand the test of time, leave them alone. So far every single Star Trek Big Picture has been with an original story, even TNG movies never remade from an old old movie.
  The first Star Trek movie Abrams did offered us a great perspective of the whole crew and how they came to be, this movie although is entertaining, was not nearly as fresh and exciting as the previous one.
  Lets get some new material. There are literally dozens of books out there written over the years. For God sake, make a movie from one of them, stop trying to remake an old movie from the 80's that is already great. Whats next, ""The Search for Kirk""..Lets just remake all the Star Trek movies and re-arrange the story's........JJ find some thing original and run with it.",1379289600,3,4719,4.4982456140350875

Shame on you Paramount. Stop trying to sell crap for too much money. Very very, very, disappointed.",1379289600,2,577,4.342592592592593

5293867,2,B009934S5M,"Paramount's Star Trek Into Darkness (STID) Blu-ray 3D+Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy)multiple movie releases epitomize how big business manipulates us, the consumers, into buying more than one copy of movies that we like. However mean this may sound, I get it: this is a business model that requires commercial alliances between the movie companies and retailers to obtain additional revenue through sales of a medium that everyone says is ""dead"" (DVDs)but that most consumers still prefer and that, in reality, is not going to go away.
However, how is it that STID purchasers can meekly accept that they will NOT get the full complement of bonuses, commentaries and features is beyond me. Please understand that the only way to have them all is to purchase three (3) separate versions of the STID Blu-ray DVD (Amazon, Target and Best Buy) AND download certain features both through a service called CinemaNow and through ITunes (if you don't have an IOS-based tablet or phone, you can't do this, either), and neither can be watched on a regular TV. One of this features (the one only available through ITunes) is a complete movie commentary that includes the complete movie and filmed comments by the director, JJ Abrams, producers, starts, etc.
These practices are shameful and deceitful, and only designed to milk the fan and consumer into buying multiple copies of the DVD, plus registering in CinemaNow and going to ITunes.
Do not get me wrong: The quality of the  various versions of STID's DVD/Blu-ray quality is outstanding, and the movie itself is a great addition to the Star Trek multiverse (I will not go into a review of the movie since most of the Amazon customers leaving a comment do that; there is no question about it, it is excellent!)
However, please consider these issues when contemplating the possibility of purchasing this movie in its present multiple versions. The movie is already #4 in DVD sales in Amazon (as of this writing), but if you resist the temptation of buying it NOW, and wait for the (inevitable) OTHER extended version (or versions), you will obtain a richer experience and more bang for your buck; plus, by not buying into their scheme, you are sending a message to Paramount Pictures that you are a savvy consumer, and that you will not accept this questionable marketing practice.",1379289600,,2318,4.974226804123711

But JJ Abrams and friends really nailed it with this one, creating a universe that is at times ridiculously colorful and at others convincingly dark, with CGI so seamless that you don't even think of it as CGI- it just blends in with everything else. It's a fantastic, fun thrill ride. I wasn't particularly impressed with the characters' personalities or their dramas, but I suspect those are tailored to appeal to the old school fans, so I'm indifferent on those matters. I will, however, give credit where credit is due, and the producers and director of this movie certainly deserve it. I watched it on Blu-ray from Redbox for $1.00, and I certainly got my money's worth!

5293886,4,B009934S5M,"You will either love it or hate it.  The new stars, particularly Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto (Kirk and Spock) have done an amazing job with the mannerisms and interactions that Bill Shatner and Leonard Nimoy created with the characters.  The doctor was acceptable...the rest of the characters were just...characters. If you aren't looking at the screen, you'll swear that Scotty is Craig Ferguson talking. Maybe it's more realistic to have an actual Scotsman playing the part...but he doesn't sound or even remotely resemble James Doohan.  I wish they had allowed Doohan's son to play the part...it would have been much better.

According to the hard core fans on Shatner's Facebook, some comic books in between the two new movies indicated the story in these to be an ""alternate timeline"".  I don't care for this concept, and the fact that they blew up Vulcan in the first movie.  I think it has screwed up the continuity that was always so carefully preserved with all the shows and movies, and it's a shame.

That being said, it was still a fun movie...half of it taken from Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan.  They used a lot of those scenes, although some reversed. You can't imagine Spock screaming KHANNNNNNNN! yet he does.  Both actors cry too easily, which is somewhat irksome.  They have taken the two most macho characters in our folklore and turned them into metro-sexuals. :-)

Anyway, it's a good little video, especially if you aren't a hard core fan and won't be insulted with the changes.  I'm glad to hear JJ. Abrams is moving to Star Wars, though.  I think his tendency for fluff will be more appreciated in that movie line.",1379203200,3,1642,4.73943661971831

The special effects are very good and quality of the performances of the cast are spot on and bring across the personality and relationships that the characters have developed as they begin to meld themselves into a young crew of a Federation starship. Chris Pine is molding himself into the role of Captain Kirk quite well and he brings a type of enthusiasm into the roll that makes you simply want him and the crew to succeed. I won't go into the movie plot as you have to watch the film and enjoy it.

This is a great film and I rated it as a 5 star movie. I do wish that the script had not depended so much on bringing back so many of the Star Trek clich&eacute;s and old characters. After all the future is different with the destruction of the Vulcan home world in the first movie of this series and there are so many opportunities for many great plots and events to occur differently. The future films do not have to fall so much in line with the old antagonist characters and there is a whole galaxy to explore.

That being said the film is still exciting and action packed. It is interesting to watch the relationship between captain Kirk and Spock evolve and to see how Spock has a relationship with Lieutenant Uhura. This is one of those films that you will have to watch several times to take in all of the action packed scenes and really enjoy them.

The story is fresh with just enough backwards references for any long time fan. The characters are now more closely aligned with the original ones from all those years ago in both the TV series and films.

 Now for the glitch. I was playing the Blu ray disc and had to stop the movie in the middle when something came up. When I went back to watch the rest the disc wanted to play from the beginning, which is normal. However, on my internet connected player I would only get one or two previews and the disc would go no further. I tried the disc in my older, not connected player, and the disc went right to the movie menu. I put the disc back in the other machine and turned off the internet connection and the disc went right to the menu and played fine. I do not care for the previews, but I could not get to the movie without disabling them.",1379203200,,972,4.137566137566138
5293912,1,B009934S5M,"The plot and backstory of this movie deviate so much from the orginal series and all the other star trek movies and series that I absolutely hated it.  Yeah, it's PRETTY but after a while that Enterprise bridge looks like a 1990's version of a 1950's diner --what with all the white surfaces and colored lights.

And the uniforms, I counted at least five different styles --including that Star Wars, pseudo Nazi, uniform worn by those at Starfleet. Geez! And the ""lens flares"" (you know the light streaks from the lights as the camera moved), someone must really like those because they appeared so much I felt as if I should be wearing sunglasses.  It looked so bright on that set, in fact, I'm surprised the actors were not wearing sunglasses themselves.

In addition, what was up with the lower portion insides of the Enterprise looking like the lower insides of the Titanic?  I bet someone used old photos of the engine room of the Titanic to design the set of this movie.  And, what about the personality of Captain Kirk?  He acted so reckless and immature, I wouldn't loan him my car much less let him captain a ship.  The original Kirk could sleep around, flirt, drink a little, but he acted like a grown man, not a high school senior just experiencing sex and alcohol for the first time.

I think it is cool how the producers were able to match contempory actors with those of the original series, but after a while I thought I was watching Saturday Night Live caricatures.  I felt that through much of the movie the editors had run the voice sound tracks through a digital filter to make the actors sound more like their counterparts of the original series.

Moreover, one of the hallmarks of the Star Trek series and movies has always been a certain grounding in the physics of reality -- not with this movie.  That is you would never have seen someone jumping the equivalent of six stories to a fast moving vehicle.  (You know, it only takes a two story drop to kill or severly mame someone.)

The movie felt at times as if it were one of those overdone action movies in which the directors like computer gernerated effects so much, they don't care how cartoonish their movie appears.

5293918,3,B009934S5M,"The first film looked like a modern take on an old TV show and was OK.  This one was worse and not worth owning unless you are a Star Trek fan.  Aside from the leads looking ugly (Kirk looks like a frog), the sole black woman being in helpless love with an alien, the old 60's clothes should have been jettisoned. Aside from the ugly leads, the clothes single handily ruins the film.  Why would an army go around in shirts?  The clothes and guns still have that 1960's look to them.  This is one of the reasons I always liked Star Wars better than ST.  SW looked futuristic but the weapon looked believable.

I saw 1960's looking phasers, pants and shirts.  Why have that in it with all of the CGI?  In fact, the CGI does not help expand the scope of ST because the TV show's appeal was wrapped around the stories due to the lower budget.  You know, when you have less money you concentrate on a better story.  When you have more money you concentrate on special effects and less story.  They should end this right here.  There is a reason why the 1979 ST expanded it's scope and changed the uniforms (besides SW having been out), it is because the 1960's clothes were unique to those times and only cool to those who lived through it.

The story is nothing more than the Wrath of Khan, but less creepy and played by a white guy (British at that) this time, which kind of takes away from the guy being names Khan.  The grand admiral (Peter Weller.  I thought he was a professor?) has a blond haired, blue eyed British daughter.  Explain to me how this is possible.  I get tired of Hollywood inserting the random British person in films and acting as if we should not question why they are British!  I do believe that they make their own movies right?  I don't see random Americans in their films!  In fact, I don't see any at all!

Now to JJ Abrams.  It is sad that they picked this guy to direct the next Star Wars film instead of a Christopher Nolan, who emphasizes story and feasibility in his films.  Look what he did to the once silly character of Batman. He made that believable. Abrams is not a good director at all and if it were not for CGI, there would be nothing about this film that would make you think quality.  Abram's main shots seem to be one or two persons on screen with close angles - that's really it.  He never gives us a true scope of a film and his films don't seem complete either.  I seriously think that George Lucas is better.  Hopefully Disney will come to their senses and get someone more capable.  On top of that, you never want to have a guy who directed Star Trek do Star Wars, which requires much more skill.  Ah well, hopefully it will be for only one film and at least George Lucas does not have to have his name attached to anything but the story.",1379203200,2,2785,4.259541984732825

They tried to tie in an original Shatner TV episode with an original movie theme and it became confusing.  I like it when they do something that ties in with past episodes that make sense but when they don't, well, it diminishes the illusion of why we're at the movie to begin with.

When I watched it the first time I didn't really think about the scenes that would emphasize the 3D effect but when I watched it in 3D it became clear why they had been photographed the way they had. I must admit I found myself dodging spears in the 3D version.

I've begun to grow accoustomed to the new cast of characters and I'm not really sure why that may be. I don't know if they're adapting to their roles better or I've just gotten a little more used to seeing them in those roles. Regardless the new cast is less of an issue now than it was in their first movie and I was better able to simply enjoy the story and the movie. This is probably only my imagination but the younger versions of the characters are beginning to remind me more of their more familiar older versions.

One bit of trivia that I found interesting was the introduction of Carol; the one who becomes the mother of Kirk's son David. Star Trek fans will already know how that ends.

I love the story and the effects but I am terribly, horribly upset, completely aghast at the departure of the historical story line of one character. This movie is supposed to be the beginning of the characters careers and it totally disregards the back story of one of the main characters.  And when I say ""back story"" I'm talking about what has already aired on the original Star Trek show some 45 years ago and the character appeared again in one of the Star Trek movies.  Inconsistancy is a crime in a series like this.  The Nemesis in the story also doesn't completely fit his back story (going forward story) but close enough that it wasn't troublesome.  And if the writers come back and say it's because past and future Spock are now in the same time line together so this altered everything else then I'll have to say that's a cop out and a lazy man's attitude.

Again the characters are true enough to themselves that you get an entertaining movie and some well timed chuckles.  The use of 3D produces some stunning eye candy and yet added to the realism.  3D faces and pillows that seem realistically 3D and not over done, but also debris flying through your living room on occasion.  The story was a good choice and less worrisome than the 'Star Trek: Enterprise' feel of the first.  A bold choice to include an iconic figure from the past has proven controversial.  It is impossible to fill the original shoes.  However, the actor did a great job and I was perfectly at ease with the inclusion to the story.  I don't want to add a spoiler so I will just leave it at that.

3D note:
We had to replace our TV due to its death, so we went with 3D which was a negligible add on.  I wasn't sure it would work for me. But I can't imagine watching this movie without it.  It just brings so much more to you.

5293946,4,B009934S5M,"Star Trek: Into Darkness is a great movie. A sequel to 2009's Star Trek, Into Darkness is in some ways both a remake and a tribute to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. For me, it works on all levels. It's exciting, action-packed, clever, and highlights certain moral concerns and character relationships that are true to the legacy of this amazing franchise.

The only reason to knock a star off of this rating is because of the product itself. I'm not huge on special features. In general, I just want to movie itself with high picture and sound quality. The only ""special"" thing I tend to go for is if there's a director's cut (like for Lord of the Rings and Watchmen, where the added material vastly improves the films). I rarely watch a commentary, and I'll watch little featurettes once, if at all.

But this bizarre insult to fans, spreading features out through vendor-exclusive releases, which don't even necessarily have the features, like a commentary, available on a disc . . . that's just wrong. Truly, unambiguously wrong. For myself, I don't feel too affected. I wanted the movie, I love the movie, I like having both the blu-ray and dvd. For others, the completists out there, you're going to be angry and disappointed, and I don't blame you one bit. I felt the same way about the dvd sets for the tv shows, too, where there were no commentary tracks and minimal special features. I don't really need them, but I can totally see how others would feel shafted. If ever there were a franchise where the devoted fans deserve the best, it's Star Trek.

Honestly, I found it a little disappointing, so much recycled from 1982's ""the Wrath of Khan"" Star Trek 2.  It was hard for me to sink my teeth into any part of the story.  We're off to a mysterious Klingon planet for no reason; there's a mysterious evil starfleet admiral with his own monster ship; for me the best part of the entire film was the hyperdrive chase between the 2 ships (hey, something original!)

The last 30 minutes of the movie seem unnecessarily long and pointless.  The film seems to hint at some vast, mysterious conspiracy without ever explaining anything sensible.  There are MAJOR improbable points at every turn:  an admiral's daughter forges her name and sneaks onto a starship, really?  And, apparently, the best way to align your warp core is to send your captain to KICK the WARP CORE until it comes online.. any high school physics professor could tell you that this would likely incinerate the person in the process.

For the most part, I agree with the ""Honest Trailer"" review here:
[...]

I mean, if you're going to remake ""the Wrath of Khan"", then why not just do that?  It was a good story the first time around.  Instead this story really goes nowhere and is mostly of the ""vast evil conspiracy"" variety without any real rationale.

Many see the ""reboot"" as bringing new life to a struggling franchise, but the fact of the matter is that Star Trek's time has simply come and gone. Thatt these ""reboot"" movies take place within an ""alternate timeline"" underscores the obvious that no, this is not the same franchise. By definition it is something new. For those who can get behind a new franchise of Star Trek themed action movies, the ""alternate timeline"" approach offers a tantalizing universe of possibilities, limited only by the imaginations of the filmmakers. And what do they come up with? A revamped version of The Wrath of Khan. Much has already been said about the many plot holes, lack of character development, and turning the characters into caricatures of their former selves (especially in the case of Khan, who is played SO far over the top that you'd think he's spoofing a comic book supervillain), but IMHO the biggest issue is the sheer lack of originality, especially given the boundless possibilities afforded by the new timeline.

Now I digress a moment to set the tone.
The primary need for the consumers of any story is internal consistency of the Rules of that Universe.

A writer basically tells what is possible and not within the story. They are then obligated to the reader, listener, audience, from then on to remain faithful to those rules they have established for the story. No matter what kind of genre they are writing this one Rule never varies. The reason it is a Rule is because it is how the audience understands the tension of situations. Say you have aardvarks and they have spaceships. If you show the aardvarks outside the ship without any sort of protection on you are telling your audience that these aardvarks don't need the protection to function in space in this Universe. If you then later attempt to build tension by having your aardvark hero shot out of an airlock the audience will not see the dilemma because they know that the hero can and has survived in space without protection before.
The writers of this movie fail at this, horrendously. Rules change to suite the whim of the writer leaving a confusing mash of action vignettes strung together without the consistency of a good story. The reason I bring this up in such detail is because to use the name Star Trek you are accepting the Rules within THAT Universe for your story. The name is shorthand for everything previously established. The writers of this film are very poor at writing stories. They have no consistency, even just within the movie, let alone beyond it. One writer who was called on the carpet actually went on twitter (no names) to lash out at his critics and bash fans. His most telling rant though was something like, ""there is a reason that some people write movies and others dont."" I expect he was implying that you must have a certain rare and non-questionable skill to be such a writer. I can think of dozens movies just in the past few years that clearly establish that for writing movies and television it is definitely not what you do but who you know that gets you the job.

Im not one of those that think movies are much worse than in the past. Having seen hundreds if not a couple of thousand movies even, I can say that 80% of all movies in any year have been mostly crap. Sometimes its the writing, others the acting, or the director mad a mess of the plotting or direction. some are enjoyable with your brain turned off but most all are easily forgotten. Classics are movies NOT forgotten and maybe one a year, if even that, is rare to fall into this category. i personally believe that in 20 years Star Trek will still be enjoyed but these two ""reboots"" will be an embarrassing joke to the rest.

I will say though that as a movie removed of any history and keeping your expectations low even if the names had all been changed it is a fun ride.
As Star Trek, though, it is a painful experience. I wanted to like it on even a basic action, explosions, humorous quips, level but it failed to keep me interested with its completely awful writing; the dialog was painful and some of the situation completely unbelievable with what you had been told earlier.

Abrams is well documented for ignoring anything in a story except spectacle and shock. Its in poorly written and paced television and in his poorly written movies.
I have absolutely no idea why anyone would still let him make a movie, except perhaps that his name is well known. And just like M. Night Shamalamadindong he will inevitably fail one time too many. and his fans will abandon him, justly.

If it were on a channel as I was surfing through I might leave it on but don't buy it and believe you are getting value.
Others have spoken about the awful packaging that Paramount has done to wring every last penny from this poorly treated franchise. That in itself is a shame. It would be like inheriting the Hope Diamond and then having it breaking it down, advertising, ""BUY A PIECE OF THE HOPE DIAMOND !"" just to make squeeze the extra few dollars from its name recognition.
I will lastly say (is anyone actually still reading this?) That I don't like the ""reboot"" of famous franchises in general because they really have little integrity to stand on by their own merits. Casablanca was actually made 3 times, the other 2 the same year as the 1 with Bogart and Becall. Only the Bogart/ Becall movie is remembered because everything came together in that film where the others didnt. Could a retelling add anything new to it? Very doubtful. Reboots are an ego trip, a self stroking of the Producer/Director to put his own stamp to something that came before. Comic books movies are an exception to this, in my personal opinion, because comic books are pretty much rebooted every time their is a new writer on board anyway. They recreate the origin with some variant and try to refashion the character to their own fanboy obsession with it. Whats funny to me is that except for a rare few, almost all the comic book reboots actually look identical, maybe a place name of an angle is adjusted. Why does Batman, or Superman need an origin story every single time its remade. We get it, we know, its the same thing for 2/3 of the movie followed by whatever minor variation of the villain is attached. To me most of the directors of reboots just have nothing relevant to say and so slap a reboot together.

Okay, Im done now. Thanks for reading (the hushed silence of an empty room).

That was just plain stupid.

I can now accept the continuity issues. After all, this is a reboot rather than a remake. I like the cast very much. They are not clones of the original actors but they have the essence of personality done very well. J.J. Abrams action sequences are great, IMO.

Such films are designed exclusively it seems to guarantee a hefty return on investment by catering to a dumb, dumber, and dumbed down audiences with one carrot and one brussels sprout at most for those who expect something more than 150 minutes of fist fights and explosions in a motion picture. I feel JJ Abrams has made another highly profitable Yugo of a movie with a shiny paint job and no new substance for audiences to ponder.

Someone with brilliant blue eyes like his is not going to be named Khan Noonien Singh though.

If you're aware scientific study has discovered even chimps know bad behavior from good and in their form of society will ostracize those with bad behavior, you're unlikely to find entertainment with any redeeming value in this film. Star Trek Into Darkness is truly dark.

Even the cool headed, thinking Spock expresses the worst of human traits; an ability to be narrow minded enough to act only on what stimulates our most primitive instincts. Uncontrolled lust, greed and violence as the easy solution to achieve whatever we want. This film is anti Gene Roddenberry; television screenwriter, producer and futurist; the visionary of Star Trek nearly a half century ago.

Whats wrong?
Into Darkness has all the earmarks of making a fast buck for those who can profit from sales; beginning with a pathetically poor job of linking the present storyline and script to former Star Trek programs. Its a cheap shot to mirror-image snippets of old Star Trek TV episodes or moves. Its cheap to use former programs music to make a connection instead of reflecting the original intent to utilize media to show what can be the best in humanity instead of the worst.

Captain Kirk violating the Prime Directive because it suits him (intentionally interfering in a society); having no connection to an urgent United Federation of Planets crisis or their council. Spock pummeling an opponent after they are down and no longer an imminent threat; Kirk ignoring the advice of his primary staff because it suits his personal purpose and Spock brought to emotion over a colleague because they saved his life a week ago; not because of a bond that developed over years of close association, gained respect and friendship; all represent abandonment of the intended Star Trek heritage Gene Rodenberry envisioned.

Its not the first abandonment of that heritage, but by far the most blatant effort to do nothing more than cash in on the general public. Star Trek wasn't intended to be a 007 style action series. It made an attempt in a TV environment chock full of entertain the average general public mentality of a 6-year old via primitive sets, marginal acting and second-rate scripts to instead utilize TVs media-domination for a positive cultural outcome. It recognized the ability of media to be a positive cultural influence through storytelling and became Star Trek because of an effort to reflect an improving human society.

Im not commenting about a film to preach good and evil, but I do recognize junk from uplifting, exciting entertainment. Star Trek originally gathered momentum because we all are instinctively aware of the difficult struggle humanity engages in to make progress beyond our more primitive relatives. Its an epic story that should be told over and over. Star Trek programming has often attempted to reflect this epic uplifting, exciting story. This film doesnt cut it. Its an unfulfilling story with junk distractions based on cheap noise, intense action and violence. In addition to promoting anti-social traits, it implies that not putting dangerous sociopaths on trial is their just fate. Instead, preserve them so they can again be given the gift of life to wreak havoc on future generations. Or, we might someday need genius psychopaths to rescue humankind from extinction.

OK, here we have what Star Trek fans hope for.... a continuation of Star Trek.
From a production stance, this effort is mindlessly easy since the entire scenario is not only previously created but there really is no restriction upon imagination.
All that was required is the key to unlocking a means or method to re-create the saga using the same characters in ANY story line.
That key was in the first new Star Trek movie where a new Timeline was introduced.
ALL previous characters, both hero and villain can be utilized with total poetic license.
POOF!, no limits on creativity and a huge pre-existing fan base.

Are the new Star Trek movies ""good""????
That question is purely based upon opinion and useless and invalid in terms of quality product.

Let's talk quality product instead of opinion.

There IS a serious quality problem in both the new Star Trek movies that renders them annoying at the very absolute least.
Unless you are morbidly blind and somehow mesmerized into a hypnotic trance that cannot observe reality, then you know what this technical problem is.
Lens Flares.
Question is.... did you notice that lens flares are being Artificially Generated in the CGI scenes?
PLEASE!!!!.... explain why.

Reality check....
Do YOU go through your life observing lens flares occurring in your sight picture in reality????
If so, you have either cataracts or nyctalopia.

Look closely at the end credits and witness for yourself, artificial lens flares using the exact same pattern AND including a water spotted lens effect.

WHO in their right mind would go to the trouble of creating artificial effects that do not represent or suggest that you are observing a real image or scene?
Feel the need to argue?.... watch ALL the other Start Trek movies and Series and count ALL lens flares COMBINED.
The number of lens flares will not even come close to the number of lens flares in either one of these new Star Trek movies individually.
This is VERY POOR QUALITY since every other movie or TV show you watch goes to great technical lengths to eliminate those ANNOYING LENS FLARES.

Evidently....
J.J. Abrams has lost his mind and has been viewing reality through a camera lens for so long that he has brain washed himself into believing that all of reality is one big lens flare after another after another after another after another after another after another after another after another after another... and so brain washed that he has added lens flares to computer generated scenes because he thinks this adds a touch of reality.

So,.... do you like the movies?
Who cares what your opinion is?
Is this a Quality Product?.... absolutely not regardless of an opinion.

Before you engage in a losing argument that will ultimately ask what you see with your own eyes in reality rather than through an optical lens..... go back and watch the movie again and this time, OBSERVE the lens flares instead of a camera close-up that chops off the top of an actor's head due to a wacky 2.4:1 aspect ratio.
Do this and you will agree that the production is not a quality product.

The lens flares have to go.",1379116800,3,3120,4.793296089385475

5294009,3,B009934S5M,"Having been a fan of Star Trek for most of my life, I struggled greatly with JJ Abrams reboot/reimagining from the very beginning. The key for me was to regard this new Star Trek as a completely new entity, and not compare it with the original ""classic"" series cinematic outings. The first film was a good start, and as long as I avoided any comparisons, I found I could enjoy it fairly well. This film, ""Into Darkness"" is a well made, mostly well acted second effort, but its insistence on putting its own spin on an original ""classic"" movie storyline basically crashed this voyage for me. These films, in my opinion, should be establishing their own universe and stories with these characters, not mirroring or mining what has come before. The film doesn't seem to know whether it wants to strike out on its own, or simply be a reworked homage. This incarnation will never escape its predecessors shadow if it continues on this path, and in my opinion, it can only fall short as a result. The conclusion to this adventure seems to indicate that a third film will do just that, and I hope for its sake that it does.",1379116800,3,1116,4.52970297029703

5294012,5,B009934S5M,We loved this movie. Had some friends over and decided to rent this. It was enjoyed by all of us.,1379116800,,97,3.9
5294013,4,B009934S5M,"Let's start at the beginning.  First, there WILL be spoilers here, so if you haven't seen the film as yet, back away from the review.  Second, I'm a fan of Star Trek since the Original Series first aired (yes, I am that old).  Third, The Wrath of Khan has always been my favorite Star Trek film ever.

Did I enjoy it? Most definitely. I laughed, I cried, I fell in love once again with the gorgeous basso profundo voice of Benedict Cumberbatch (who I really, REALLY hope will read Edgar Allan Poe someday).

Did I think it was the greatest thing since the reboot? Sorry to say, but I didn't. It was a good film, although perhaps pandering a bit too much to those of us from the old days with Dr. Carol Marcus and mention of Christine Chapel.

The biggest problem for me is Midshipman James T. Kirk being promoted to Commander, captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise, without any stops or real training along the way. It jarred in the first film and hasn't gotten any better with this one. They did, sorta, address why that is a problem, but then it was pushed aside as if it didn't matter anymore because we have a ""crisis"". Admittedly, we soon see why the Admiral was willing to go along with it, not for the good of the service, but for his own personal agenda. He basically hoped he could use Kirk's renowned hotheadedness to achieve his own personal motives.

I did like the comparison of Khan's loyalty to his crew to Kirk's own loyalty. Both men will break any rules to save their family, that same crew. And I'm not entirely certain their methods to achieve that end would be all that different, although the Kirk we know does have some limits in regards to hurting innocents.

To be honest, once I left the theater and began thinking, I realized that the plot was a mess. Not only wasn't it logical, it didn't make sense (not always the same thing). Khan and his crew were engineered to bring peace, but were then deep-frozen as war criminals (why not just execute them?). Khan is defrosted, forced to make weapons of war for the Admiral who uses Khan's crew members as leverage. And despite being better and smarter than anyone, must less a war happy Star Fleet officer, Khan seemed to have no choice but to do the Admiral's bidding. Except he decides to, instead, blow up a top-secret facility, uses it as a way to gather all of top officers in one location (and they sure don't have many ships in Star Fleet, do they?) in order to kill the lot of them, and then flee to the Klingon sector. Explain to me exactly how that was supposed to save Khan's crew?

THEN, instead of allowing the Klingons to kill Uhura, Kirk and Spock, Khan rescues them by killing all the Klingons. Okay, I totally get why he surrendered. Once he heard how many torpedoes Kirk had, it was obvious they were his people. I give up. Trying to figure out this plot is giving me a headache.

I didn't notice, but I hope they gave the writers of The Wrath of Khan some credit for directly taking scenes and lines from the original film. I really thought going with that end scene was unnecessary, but I won't say that I didn't find myself crying just a bit with the ever excellent Zachary Quinto, even if I was saying from the moment Kirk went into the radiation chamber, ""use Khan's blood"". Speaking of which, what the hell did McCoy do with that whole tube of blood? Tests shouldn't have taken that much of it, nor would bringing a tribble back to life.

Was the conversation with old Spock really needed? Other than giving the fans another look at a Leonard Nimoy version of Spock, it didn't seem to hold much purpose for the film's development.

All the actors did a great job with what they were given to work with, but I wish it had been a tighter script. We did get some moments between characters, but I feel like everything was rushed. I had read their tweets while the film was being done and they (Quinto, Cumberbatch, Pine, Urban, and Pegg) all appeared to get along quite well. I should also mention that I was thrilled to see Noel Clarke playing Harewood. For those who don't know, he played Mickey in Doctor Who. I also spotted Scott Lawrence in the film, just one scene surprisingly enough. Fans of JAG will remember him as Commander Sturgis Turner.

The special effects were great. We've come a long way over the last 50 years, no real complaints there. I wouldn't say that the story was overwhelmed by the effects, so kudos to the crew for not making that mistake. However, I'm not so certain that the level of violence was as needed to make the point that Khan was this terrible, horrible, not very nice man.

Personally, I think that Star Fleet could've given the same sort of choice to this Khan and his people as they did to the ones from the original series, a home of their own. Hopefully on a planet that didn't go belly up like the one from the later film.

Letting Kirk lead the 5 year mission after he has made it quite clear that he cannot be trusted to obey the rules, particularly the Prime Directive? As John Watson would've said, a bit not good. Oh, and Kirk? Your record for not losing anyone in your crew sure got shot to hell and back with this one!

I would probably give the movie a B+. It was an adventure, fun and easy to watch, as long as you didn't look too closely behind the curtain.",1379116800,2,5300,4.398365679264556

I'm keeping this short as it is pretty easy to spoil scenes in this movie, and the scenes (even when spoiled) are still golden.

5294030,4,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness is the second movie set in the alternate timeline universe set up by Star Trek in 2009. In many ways Star Trek as a movie franchise is very two dimensional compared to Star Trek as a TV series. After the success of Wrath of Khan in 1982 the movies became a ""madman bent on destroying the universe"" of the week exercise. The films in general have little exploration, few philosophical debates and minimal moments of social commentary. They are a huge step above most action films in that the core of Trek remains intact - human kind is moving towards a better future, war is bad, acceptance and tolerance are good and science/logic are the best tools to confront the problems that face the world. However, they are really just dressing for various showdowns of the crew versus the generic (sometimes well-played) bad guy.

With the understanding of Star Trek as an action franchise with some sci-fi window dressing in mind, this movie hits almost all the right notes. JJ Abrams is a master at setting a scene and with little or no background on the characters involved he gets the audience to care about the outcome. The opening scene of the 2009 movie was a great example, making Kirk's birth and his father's death a powerful emotional launching pad for the whole re-imagined series. In this film, Harrison's soliloquy (Cumberbatch chews the scenery and it is awesome to watch), Kirk and Spock being reprimanded by Pike and Kirk being comforted by Pike at the bar are some high points that showcase Abrams' quick and effective character strokes.

The action scenes are a geek's dream. The Enterprise breaking out of warp (twice!) was visceral as were the scenes of the Vengeance trashing the Enterprise. The chase then fight on the Klingon homeworld bested anything seen in the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. Khan is given a great physical presence whether proving himself competent in hand to hand combat or his ability to be a still, confident and intelligent menace even behind bars. Finally, the Enterprise falling to Earth was a thrilling set-piece.

Star Trek wouldn't be Star Trek without some cringeworthy moments. Old Spock should not have been in this film. The callback to Wrath of Khan in the warp core could have been more different and still given hints and references to the older movie without being a simple reversal. The deus ex machina at the end was obvious and could have been more refined and clever. Also, Spock is too emotional too often.

Complaints aside, this was a very enjoyable action movie and it is always fun to see the crew of the Enterprise even if they seem to have had too much coffee in the Abrams version of Roddenberry's creation.",1379116800,,2691,4.76824034334764

5294033,4,B009934S5M,"STID depends on what you're expecting. I won't say I loved the film, but it still kept the ball rolling.

If you're new to Trek, it's a fantastic movie in most ways. If you've been around the block with TOS and know the movies, you'll likely have a more than a few more bones to pick with the plot and characters. All in all, from both sides STID is not as good as the first movie, but it is still GOOD.

Chris Pine does the character of Captain Kirk justice in a ways that Shatner never did (in my opinion--I mean come on, Tarsus? Where the hell is the rest of THAT story?--and Zachary Quinto is flawlessly Vulcan except when he's not, which Nemoy seldom was. Bones doesn't get as much screen time in this film, I think, which is frankly tragic considering how ridiculously on point Karl Urban interprets a younger version of the surly southern doctor. If there's one thing Urban is good at, it's scowling like he can't make his face do anything else. McCoy is unfortunately relegated to some one-liners and a bit of insignificant dialog, but Karl Urban puts on his scowly face and does what he can to make the movie better.

I won't say STID meshes with my ideals of continuation from the first Reboot movie, but it's good. Cumberbatch is a fantastic Villian, whatever complaints about how he looks, and the plot and message are varied but focused. I couldn't ask for a more well-rounded film... even if I would have approached it differently.

All I can really say as someone who knows TOS as that this is an Alternate Universe, and these are self-contained plotlines. Existing ideas are used as an homage, not as a template, and it's imperative to keep an open mind if you hope to enjoy this movie.

That being said, plot holes abound. Stupid film making mistakes are here and there, and some really big events are ignored in favor of moving on. Not my favorite thing.

5294035,3,B009934S5M,"The special effects are well done if a bit pointless, and the acting is generally engaging. But there's nothing original or interesting here.

Look, we're already saddled with characters who we've now known for close to 50 years. We know none of them is ever going to die or be in any real danger. That's a pretty big eight ball to be behind in trying to develop stories for what's essentially a space western. So why compound the problem by reintroducing guest characters from earlier Star Trek fare? Do we really need to see Khan in this movie as the evil protagonist? Couldn't they come up with something or somebody else? You know, something NEW?

And the basic crew of the USS Enterprise are morphing into superheroes. The fight sequence between Spock and Khan is absolutely cartoonish and ridiculous. Funny how a character who has spent the better part of 4 decades searching to get in touch with his humanity has jumped the shark to become The Mighty Thor.

Worst is the scene that mirrors the death of Spock from Star Trek II, here inverted to having Kirk die while Spock lives. We're even treated to Spock yelling ""Kh-a-a-n,"" this time, rather than Kirk. Is this supposed to be high camp? Of course, Kirk is brought back from the dead after Spock beats the crap out of Khan and they derive a life-giving serum from Khan's blood. McCoy says it's their only hope...but, wait a sec...aren't Khan's 76 cohorts lying in suspended animation canisters in the Enterprise? Don't they all have the same genetically enhanced blood as Khan? Er, I think we missed something obvious here - why not take the elevator down to the storage area and draw some blood from one of Khan's sleeping buds, rather than chasing him around San Francisco, jumping like Spiderman from flying car to flying car?

I'll bet you a nickel the Borg show up in the next Star Trek movie.

Funny how the original TV series and its various spinoffs had no problem coming up with new enemies, dangers and challenges, and on a weekly basis. Where did Khan, the Borg, tribbles and the rest originally come from? From a CREATIVE mind, that's where. Yet the best these movies can seem to do is to recycle villains and situations from the TV series over and over again. The very first Star Trek movie basically took the plot of the ""Nomad"" TV episode and turned it into ""Ve-jer."" The first remake in the JJ Abrams series took the story from the movie ""ST Nemesis"" and switched the hatred of a Romulan outlaw to be directed at Spock, rather than Picard. And now, Khan returns. Why?

5294036,3,B009934S5M,"This is a review of the phaser included with the movie. I preordered mine several months ago and got it in on the 10th. The weight and size of the phaser surprised me, I didn't realize the ones in the movie were that large. The weight makes it feel like a quality piece but the construction was somewhat lacking. QMX's website says the phasers spinner is ""spring loaded with an active locking mechanism that snaps the spinner neatly in place."" but there is no spring loaded anything, you manually spin the spinner into place with your finger and the locking mechanism is magnets with one in the phaser body and one in either end of the spinner. The lack of a spring loaded phaser wouldn't bother me so much if the spinner would actually turn freely but it gets stuck on the phaser body and has to be forced the rest of the way around. Not only that but the magnets are misaligned so when the magnets lock on the red tip, the phaser tip is off center from the rest of the weapon. Seems like alot of people had the same issue with the spinner not moving freely and getting stuck. I suppose i could have exchanged it but i've read of several people doing so and getting one made just as poorly. Some people have received perfect ones though so i guess its just chance.

I don't think it was one of the better Star Trek movies.  The special features are OK but not great.

5294054,1,B009934S5M,"This is the worst sci fi movie ever! And I've seen some bad ones in my time. Those professing to be ""Star Trek"" Fans are either liars or Trekkers. The Casual Fan who really doesn't pay too much attention to anything but the cute actors and the special effects. But REAL TREK FANS PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE STORY AND THE CHARACTERS. And this story was a horrible rehash of a much superior movie. MAGIC BLOOD!? LOL!
Abrams and his little writers forgot half-way through that they were TRYING to write a wanna-be Star Trek film and instead wandered in a Harry Potter one.
These may be ""Big Budget"" but they are extremely Low Quality!
I know a lot of fools are babbling that Abrams allegedly ""REVIVED INTEREST IN A DYING FRANCHISE"".................BALONEY! Anyone saying that is either a liar OR they are completely clueless!
There has always been and always WILL be a HIGH INTEREST IN STAR TREK!
Just because the fans DON'T LIKE what they offer DOES NOT MEAN THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN STAR TREK! It just means they have NO INTEREST in the garbage they put before us!
BTW! Reboots are for stupid incompetent lazy writers who have never had an original idea in their entire life! There are thousands of Fresh Original Ideas left in the RODDENBERRY UNIVERSE!

5294055,4,B009934S5M,"THis is a good movie. The cast is good, but did we need a story where the villain is from star fleet?. The return of Khan is a good thing. But part of the greatness of star trek was that the best villains were easily seen to be on the wrong side. DO we need the perverse attitudes about conspiracies and evil military  people from todays Hollywood.  They dropped the ball. We needed a movie about Klingons attacking and conquering. Or some such thing. But in spite of that with actors like peter weller on board the movie is still very good. BUT please have them fight some good villains and not bad star fleet officers from now on. Star trek is not about cynicism and that is not updating the premise.  this looks best in 3d of course. But then any film I have seen that is properly done in 3d looks better to me.  There's plenty of extras in this set. But I don't want or need a dvd in my set. It just raises the price for nothing.

5294058,3,B009934S5M,"Sta Trek-into Darkness(released April/13)is a bitter disappointment from the first of this new series of Star Trek films. This one stars,among others,Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk,Zachary Quinto as Spock,Zoe Saldana as Lieutenant Uhura,Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan,Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy,Simon Pegg as Scotty,John Cho as Sulu,and Peter Weller as Fleet Admiral Alexander Marcus. The film has that old debilitating film trait of wanting to do far too much within a certain time frame. And that 133 minute time frame unfortunately wears very heavily on the viewer.
The story finds the Enterprise crew on a far distant planet violating the prime directive. Kirk and Scotty flee from a primitive tribe,trying to steal a precious scroll. They in turn have to jump off a high cliff into water,and re board the Enterprise. The ship,in turn,rises out of the water in front of the tribesmen and Spock almost gets killed setting off a device which prevents the total annihilation of the planet. Back on Earth,Kirk gets his ship taken away from him by Capt. Pike,his mentor. Kirk is made 2nd officer,while Spock is transferred.
Meanwhile a ""terrorist"" has set off a terrible explosion in London,destroying a top secret Federation area called Section 31(we have heard of this in DS9).While at a meeting of top Federation captains with the fleet Admiral(discussing the terrorist act)they get attacked(a set up),and Capt. Pike is killed. The ""terrorist"" is identified as an agent from Section 31,and Kirk volunteers to bring the man back,who has fled to the Klingon home world. The Admiral tells Kirk to take along 72 new style photon torpedoes with him. He wants Kirk to launch them from the Neutral Zone to the uninhabited area where the fugitive is,and come home. The Admirals daughter accompanies him,but Scotty resigns in the process,sensing danger.
While en route to Kronos,Spock repeatedly reminds Kirk of the immorality of his orders. In the end Kirk relents and agrees to head an away mission to Kronos to capture the fugitive. When the team arrives on Kronos they are soon after set upon by a Klingon patrol. However the fugitive they seek appears to be helping them to defeat the Klingons. When the action calms down he unexpectedly surrenders to Kirk and is thrown in the brig. It is there that the man identifies himself as Khan,a 300 year old genetically superior being from Earth. The ""torpedoes"" the Enterprise carries are actually cryo tubes,containing the rest of his original crew. Spock contacts his older self,who informs him,among other things,that Kahn was the most dangerous adversary the Enterprise ever faced.
On the way home,the Enterprise is confronted by a top secret Federation ship commanded by Admiral Marcus. They end up stopped above Earth. Admiral Marcus,we find out,was the one who awoke Kahn in order to possibly glean information that might help the Federation in future battles with its enemies. However it back fired and Kahn went rogue. Now the Admiral is going to destroy the Enterprise. Scotty has infiltrated the Admirals ship and disabled its' power,just as The Admiral was about to deliver the coup de' gras on the Enterprise. While they scurry about trying to get their weapons up and running,Kirk and Kahn board them. They seize the bridge,but Kahn turns on them and kills the Admiral. Kirk,Scotty and the Admirals daughter are beamed back to the Enterprise. There,Kirk is forced to hand over the cryo tubes. However Spock has armed the torpedoes and removed the bodies. They blow the ship up and it and Kahn go down towards Earth,just missing the disabled Enterprise,which itself starts to fall out of Earth's orbit.
The anti matter reactor is totally off line and Kirk,in desperation,enters the reactor core to manually re align the reactor. This results in Kirks death,as Spock looks on. Meanwhile Kahns ship has plunged into San Fransisco,but Kahn still survives. The Enterprise scans,detects Kahns whereabouts,and Spock rushes to capture him. Just as Spock is about to deal a death blow to Kahn,Uhura shows up telling Spock to stop. They apparently need his super DNA to repair Kirk. Kirk is indeed revived and a year later is lead speaker commemorating Capt. Pike's death and commencing the Enterprise's new five year mission.
I think this time shift/change has really got to me. The sight of a Kahn that looks and sounds like a student of Cambridge University in England,instead of someone with a distinct Latino heritage(played by Ricardo Montalban,on TV AND in films),really,REALLY bugs me. Time shift or not,I think there should have been at least had SOME resemblance physically and in demeanour. I also almost laughed out loud when they recreated the Spock death scene from Star Trek 2,but in reverse,with Kirk dying instead. Now I just shake my head. What also put the nail in the proverbial coffin with this scene was Spock yelling ""Kahhhhhhhn"" aftewards. Give...me...a...break! How totally UN-believable a thing that was and a slap in the face to the entire Star Trek cannon. I also do NOT understand why they needed Kahn's DNA to bring back Kirk. They had 72 different tubes to work with,all filled with super beings with roughly the same super DNA.Any one of them would have done the trick. Right?
Not only do those points and others make me de-mark this film,but it's meandering plot is all over the galaxy. This film was far,far too ambitious and was trying to fit too much within the space of one film. The good things? I think the new actors portraying Kirk,Spock,et al,are starting to fit nicely into their roles and it was great to see Leonard Nimoy back again,if only for a few seconds. The explosions and fight scenes are all good...maybe even too good. They certainly are designed to hide this film's weaknesses. Which is harder to do than hitting a Gorn at two miles with a phaser rifle.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extra features on this DVD at all.
All in all a BIG let down from the first Abrams epic. I can only say the producers of this new line of films better beware of what Star Trek cannon they climb all over before they start pounding it into new ones. I KNOW this is a new time line,I get it Mr. Abrams. Pike wasn't supposed to die here,in the reality we know,he lived. I can understand that. But hey,a Kahn that no more resembles the original in any way,shape or form than I do...time change or no,that is wrong. And the role reversal with Kirks death instead of Spock....it was not poignant or good,just laughable. This is a film that is less than the sum of its parts. Lesson learned,so let's move on to a better(I hope)third Star Trek installment. And remember...I'll be watching.",1379030400,4,6730,4.909569798068481
5294059,5,B009934S5M,J.J Abrams reboot of Star Trek definitely has a quicker action packed pace.  But it's done well.  I think all of the casting was top notch with a special nod to Zachary Quinto for showing emotion without showing too much emotion.  Only thing I didn't like was the nods to previous franchise films which felt a bit contrived.  Still great film.  5 stars.,1379030400,,353,4.5396825396825395
5294060,4,B009934S5M,"As others have written the special features split up is without a doubt very frustrating, so I won't rehash.  The idea behind a ""Limited Edition"" or ""Special Edition"" should mean just that, the buyer is getting something more than they would in a normal release.  It just doesn't happen here.  The box and packaging material are done very well, so that the phaser replica is nice and safe along with the DVD w/slipcase as well, both nice and snug in a Styrofoam cocoon of sorts.  All versions of the movie (3D/Blu Ray and DVD) play well with no issues (other than the lack of aforementioned extras...) and the phaser replica from Qmx seems to be done pretty well.  Except here again we run into an issue of purchasing a ""Limited Edition"" and not getting something special.  The phaser itself is made in a very decent manner, don't get me wrong.  It has nice clean lines and from a few feet away looks absolutely great, but there are a few areas lacking some detail upon closer inspection.  Mainly around the buttons and smaller fin detailing, again nothing major that would severely detract from the piece.  Except along the left side of the upper ""housing"" there are several warped areas that clearly were noticed during final assembly/finishing.  As it's apparent that these areas were sanded with a heavy grit and repainted in an attempt to fix the issue, unfortunately it didn't. What it did do is leave some obvious sanding marks that allowed for the paint not to match the rest of the replica... Maybe it's just mine or maybe the entire production run had the same issue, only time will tell.  All in all I'd give the combo pack a 7.5; 3.5 out of 5 for the movie and lack of features and 4 out of 5 for the phaser replica with unprofessional finish.",1379030400,,1755,4.575079872204473

In all, a disappointing mess. I vasty prefer the character development/interaction, the humor and clarity  of New Generation; even the now-deemed corny original Star Trek. I HATE dinging ANY Star Trek venture, especially Picard & Company. Oh, re the comment on the Shatner version - I have the BLU-Ray complete original season. It's great.

This is about the ""Limited Edition"" set which includes the phaser replica. I have already seen someone else's photos uploaded for this product here and unfortunately I have same issues with my copy of the included phaser - the phaser ""tips"" or ""nozzles"" (whatever you prefer to call them) are bent downwards (they are improperly glued into their slots), there are noticeable and visually unappealing gaps between different glued-on parts (like for example between top plastic cover and the rest of the phaser) and the whole thing itself feels like a cheap plastic toy. Which is very unfortunate - the ""Limited Edition"" of previous Star Trek movie included a very well-built all-metal statue of Enterprise which was well worth its price.

Long story short - if you want to get just a movie, do NOT buy this ""Limited Edition"" copy. If you want to get a replica of some movie prop - get it somewhere else, definitely NOT from the company (QMX) which manufactured this phaser replica.

Don't get me wrong, I love all the previous movies in the franchise too, its just that these movies really capture the magic of that first love.

I greatly enjoyed the 2009 movie ""Star Trek"" so I had high expectations for this film. I think this movie surpassed my expectations. This movie has everything a Trekkie like myself could want. This movie is chocked full of action and adventure, and an intriguing story/plot with wonderful and moving character development all bound up in great eye caching special effects.

I will not rehash the plot here but I do want to mention the addition of Khan as the villain. I was not sure if this would work. Ricardo Montalban was very iconic playing the role of Khan in the original series episode ""Space Seed"" and the feature film ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and I really wondered if Benedict Cumberbatch could pull it off. With this being an alternate time line I really think it worked. Yes, this Khan is a bit different because the story that is being told is also different and within that context it workd very well.

At any rate, the cast is a wonderful recasting of all those original characters. Pine & Quinto are exquisite Kirk & Spock, and who I hope play these roles for many years, as they haven't had any other actors for so long while Shattner & Nimoy held those roles. And, of course, Benedict Cumberbatch was wonderful as the villain (won't give away who he is, here ;), and I was very well fooled by just who he was until I was IN the movie (saw it in 3d).

Also, the steelbook looks very nice, and I like the alternate cover art.  However, I was disappointed there was no version of the steelbook that included the 3-d blu-ray, so I actually bought this movie twice, one to get this version the other for the 3-D version.  But the 2D blu-ray looks spectacular as well, looks very sharp in 1080p.

My biggest problem is the sparse bonus features on the blu-ray version, and the reason why they are sparse is because they have been split up for other retailers to use as exclusives.  If you get this movie at Target, theres a whole extra disc of bonus content not on this version.

But even than, there's no movie commentary track.  To get that you are required to get the itunes version, which is the only one to have the commentary track.  I don't use apple products, but if I want to listen to commentary, I am required to download itunes and purchase the movie there (or at least use my digital code on itunes instead of ultraviolet).

Its a great movie and I love this package, but I am disappointed at Paramount for splitting all the bonus features in this manner instead of just letting us paying customers choose where we want to buy.",1379030400,2,1448,4.406015037593985

The problem was with the Blu-ray disc hesitating and black out sections for a split second during play. I originally suspected my player but on trying other Blu-ray discs and old DVDs did not experience any problems. Playing the disc again and the problems re-manifested which I can only attribute to the disc. I didn't try either the accompanying DVD or the 3D disc as I had already decided to return the product for this and the following reason.

You would have to be a certifiable trekkie to accept what was called a ""Collectible Limited Edition Phaser.""  Besides being a poorly painted lump of miscast misaligned metal it had no electronics in it whatsoever which while not actually stated might be inferred from the product description.

We are both huge fans of the original series. However, we were split with our reviews. For me it was so cool to be on the Enterprise in 3D. So I was hooked right away. I won't go thru the story line as most others comment on this. I will just say sometimes history repeats itself and this movie takes full advantage of this new adventure with Kirk & Spock. I really expect the next release to continue with the Captain and Dr. Marcus. After all, we did have a really big surprise when we first meet their son.(remember) So I give it the best rating mostly based on the 3D effects and the run in with our ""old friend"" Kahn.
  My wife however felt different with the movies ending. She felt they just ripped off Trek fans with an old idea with a twist. But, I will run this at least 1 more time and like a true fan she will watch it again. My thought is she will come around because this was visually stunning and the soundtrack is so perfect on the 3D Blu-ray, 7.1 makes it stand out like no other movie in this series.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Into-Darkness-Blu-ray-3D-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-Copy/dp/B00CTSDDVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek Into Darkness (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy)</a>",1379030400,,1427,4.820408163265306

The picture transfer to blu-ray could have been more better in my opinion, Star Trek 2009 to me looks alot better on blu-ray as apposed to this one... I know its not going to be IMAX quality, although its still an excellent movie and the Dolby DTS 7.1 HD is still great.

I pre-ordered it, knowing I would be deployed (military) when it came in and I could have my family send me my digital code and get access to it. So I received my access code, which did not work. I submitted a trouble ticket with Paramount to help resolve the issue. They turned around and within a day I had a new code. I am thinking, AWESOME! I go back to the redeeming page, and now it is country code blocked. I am done with Paramount.

Fortunately Flixster was not country code blocked, but it will not let me stream from it. My guess is the country code. So I have to download it, and it is currently ticking. From what I have read, it may count as ""Premium Content"" which means I can download it a total of 3 times, then it is worthless. The even better part is, I cannot stream it from UltraViolet's site now, it just redirects to Flixster. Who knows if they would even let me stream the content I bought while in a foreign country?

Paramount, even if the movie is the best thing since sliced bread, I am never buying your products again. I am going to say you are doing an amazing job of combating piracy when you screw over those who are willing to spend the money on products they will enjoy.

1. J.J. Abrahms had said that he wasn't going copy anything of the storyline of the older movies, that is all the last 30 minutes of this movie did. And did very poorly i thought, as an old school star trek fan some one who has seen every episode and every movie, i found that extremely distasteful. I was almost just a bad remake almost to the point of being a parody of the original wrath of kahn.

2. The special effects were great. That being said, i think the were the best part of the movie.

3. The actors did a good job, but i think the script was poorly written, or at least the plot was.

I will never buy this movie, i did see it a second time when someone took me(I was glad i didn't pay for the ticket the second time). It was worse the second time than the first for me therefore, i won't waste my money on something that i didn't like.

There is plenty of the sci/fi action we've come to expect and stunning special effects from Industrial Light and Magic; but this one also features an outstanding story; excellent dramatization; superb acting and the best villain - my opinion again - of any ""Star Trek"" film. Benedict Cumberbatch, as the villain with the familiar name of Khan, delivers a truly memorable and possibly career defining performance. Other standouts include Chris Pine reprising his role as Captain Kirk, from the 2009 film; Zachary Quinto as Spock; and Zoe Saldana as Uhura. Leonard Nimoy makes a cameo appearance as Spock Prime.

I'm only giving this movie a 4 star rating for the reason that the blu ray 3d does not play the Dolby TrueHD track.

I checked the pop up menu and it was showing the movie was set at Dolby TrueHD 7.1, but the sound quality was not there.

 I stopped the movie and made sure my settings were good on my PS3 and restarted the movie and still no Dolby TrueHD. I decided to try the regular blu ray version (non 3d) and what do you know, the movie was playing in Dolby TrueHD 7.1.

Now to some of you it might not be a big deal, but i just recently bought a yamaha (RX-V373) surround system that supports DTS HD-MA and Dolby True HD. I know this receiver is only a 5.1 but i tried other 3d movies like The Avengers and The Amazing Spider Man and they all play in either DTS HD-MA or Dolby TrueHD.

I was really excited to watch the 3D version of star trek into darkness at home with the highest surround settings. I was really impressed when I saw the movie in theaters and thought to myself ""I wounder how it would sound at home?"". To my dissapointment i get the minimal surround sound settings at home.

Now im not talking about screen accuracies. Im talking about how its put together and how its molded.

It looks like a 3rd grader bought a model and was too impatient to take the time to make it look good and forced every single piece. My last problem is that the ""STUN/KILL"" function has to be done manually. There is no button for it to switch on its own. The pics on amazon.com are totally mis-leading.

This film was either given praise or hate, I personally enjoyed it.

Many criticize the film for not staying true to its mirror image ""The Wrath Of Khan"". I personally believe they are each great in their own special way. In this version he is more physical in the original he was more mentally controlling. Both are fine ingredients in a villain and I could elaborate more on the differences between the two Khan performances but I feel watching the performances does them more justice and both films are indeed worthy of a watch, or two, or three!

I submitted a support request through the Paramount support link. But I have not yet received an e-mail response.

So, considering a lack of Blu-Ray extras and no digital copy, this purchase has been doubly disappointing.
My rating is low because of the quality of the product (I added one star because I enjoyed the film). If I am able to someday get my digital copy, then my rating will improve.

* Update 9/16/13;
Paramount responded by e-mail on 9/13 and after getting the needed receipt got me a new authorization code today.
It took several hours to down load the movie and extras.

- On my Windows PC, after updating my iTunes to version 11, the downloaded movie and the extras for 'Star Trek Into Darkness' worked properly. (The downloaded movie/extras did not work well with iTunes version 10.)

* For my iPad I was able to transfer/sync Star Trek Into Darkness and the movie works fine on the iPad.

* The Blu-Ray version looks beautiful and I have a working digital copy with a version of a commentary which is a welcome bonus. I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase. (Because I got my digital copy with iTunes, I got a commentary that includes input from the director/writer. That was a pleasant surprise.)

5294161,1,B009934S5M,"There is little to like about this latest Star Trek movie, and I'm a life-long fan.

SPOILER ALERT

This film is so unoriginal it copies the exact scene in ""Wrath of Khan"" where Spock dies, only reverses the positions of Spock and Kirk. It's Kirk who dies saving the ship from a warp core breach brought on by Khan. It even has Spock screaming, ""Khan!"" like Kirk did in Star Trek II. Then Kirk is magically brought back to life by Khan's healing blood. (I'm rolling my eyes right now.)

The casting is bad. Khan was originally played twice by Ricardo Montalban, and he did a great job. He had a Spanish accent and a very well-developed body. Montalban was believable as a genetically enhanced man. The actor playing Khan in this film, Benedict Cumberbatch, has neither. When you're watching the film and you first learn Cumberbatch is Khan, you're left thinking, ""HUH? This skinny guy?"" He isn't believable. Couldn't they have found a Hispanic actor with a six-pack to play Khan?

They threw in hottie actress, Alice Eve, to play Kirk's old flame, Carol Marcus, the mother of his love child, David. Sadly, Alice has no real role. She is simply eye candy. The writers could have explored the relationship she develops with Kirk, since we've never seen any of that, but no. Instead, we just see her in underwear.

Then there's Kirk, who keeps flouting the rules, acting illogically and irresponsibly, but does so because he's so noble, so heroic. He's always risking his life for others. He cares so much he should have been a nurse instead of a starship captain. It isn't believable someone would get away with so much bad behavior from their employer (Starfleet) or have such luck.

They need to stop making Star Trek movies. They are out of ideas.

Movie is AWESOME!

Phaser Review:
I pre-ordered this in June(?) and had a bit of buyers remorse at having spent so much on a movie, but I wanted the phaser! The other pre-order included the villain ship for much less - but i figured that for $20 bucks or so the ship must be tiny/cheap. When it arrived (on time 9/10/13) I the first thing that I noticed is how heavy it was - it definitely didn't feel cheap. I then pushed everything that could possibly be a button - to try and get the stun/kill thingy to spin - nothing! Disappointment set in. I had never been to the QMx website to read about the features of the phaser - I had only looked at the pics provided by Amazon showing the action blur indicating spin. I did more research online and actually read (from QMx) the description of the phaser. It is EXACTLY as described by the manufacturer. The only real fault I have is with the incomplete description by Amazon. I then spent the next 45 minutes shooting the cats, people on tv and my husband - pew-pew-pew!!! Disappointment gone! It now has a place of honor next to my 3152 piece LEGO Super Star Destroyer.

My phaser:
1) Is heavy, solidly built and feels great in your hand
2) Is lined up perfectly (all parts)
3) Spins freely (manually) and settles (magnetically) into place
4) Is painted beautifully - no drips or areas missed

5294165,5,B009934S5M,"First, I have to admit that I have and always will be a Star Trek fan, from the original series to the movie reboots. I was so pleased with this movie and the quality of the video. Abrams has managed to maintain the heart of the rebooted Star Trek without changing the characters drastically. So glad to see Roddenberry's ideals continued and I'm thrilled to see that the heart of Star Trek is still beating so strongly for yet another generation to enjoy! Excellent film. If only a new series would return . . .",1378944000,,512,4.4
5294166,3,B009934S5M,"I was a big fan of the original Star Trek series in the late 60s, and as I have said before, I used to race home to see it on TV when there was a new episode.  As a matter of fact, we were probably the first people on our block who owned a color television, and from what I remember, the series originally aired in color.  (I remember watching the first lunar landing on TV, and I was very disappointed that it was in black and white.  ""Where is the high definition color, in 3D!"" would have been my exact words if HD existed at the time, and if I hadn't have been in awe of that event.  And yes, 3D did exist, albeit in a different form.)

The first Star Trek film with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto was pure bliss.  After years and years of borderline lame Star Trek films, I was really proud of the way that the director, producers, and screenwriter pulled off that first film.  It was a true homage to the series, never devolving in any way; there were characters and not caricatures, and the dialog and action were fantastic.  So, I was really looking forward to this film.  And boy, was I disappointed.  No, make that borderline mad.

This is really a stinkeroo, in every way.  Everything that they got right in that first film was seemingly turned on its head in ""Into Darkness.""  I could complain about all kinds of things, but what was the worst:  the dialog.  Way, way, way too much exposition here.  You have characters talking and talking and talking, and it never seems to end.  Kind of like a review that rips a film such as this.

One piece of dialog that really was a misfire:  when Bones is trying to convince Kirk not to do something -- I can't remember exactly what that was, and I really don't care -- and the doctor said something like, ""That would be like robbing a bank when you have a getaway car with a flat tire!""  Now, I don't know about you, but cars will NOT have tires that far in the future; they will surely be flying cars.  So this character would surely not use this metaphor in this scenario that far in the future.  No way.  No stinking way!

And then he used another!  Something about a poker player and an ace card.  Yikes.  Well, at least the dialog was somewhat saved by the Kirk character when he responded with something like, ""Enough with the metaphors already!""  I couldn't have agreed more.  And it would have been better if Kirk would have looked into the camera -- ala Woody Allen -- and said something like, ""O.K.  I can't believe that I have to speak this dialog.  But I'm under contract to do so and so please don't get mad at me.  Get mad at the writer instead.""  (Naturally, with most Woody Allen films, the writer would be himself but whatever.)

A huge misfire, of intergalactic proportion.  I will go three here only because some of the special effects and cinematography were really good.  But this would be a pretty big pass by me, in any galaxy, and I might say something like, ""How about if we take the original hard drive that this film is on and throw it into the Event Horizon?""",1378944000,3,3040,4.309187279151944

The opening ""Bond like"" sequence was interesting and beautifully portrayed on screen. The initial set up to the plot conflict was intelligent and well paced out with several action spots. Like some other reviewers have mentioned however, the ending slipped a bit because it became so typical of many action films. As a result, the ending came across as cliche', overblown and unrealistic (Spock is awesome, but I didn't think he possessed uber-strength that approaches Khan's!). The ending is what drops my rating one star. Nonetheless, I found this movie to be very entertaining on the whole and I do hope they make another in the series.",1378944000,,952,4.810975609756097

5294176,2,B009934S5M,"Although I'm by no means a hardcore Star Trek fan, I've watch Star Trek from day one and this movie makes me cringe. The action sequences and special effects are excellent, but everything else about the movie can be summed up in one word: HORRIBLE! The way the actors try to imitate the original cast is very annoying. The humor falls flat, because there's nothing original about it. Bottom line, the cast is a very, very cheap imitation of the original cast. What little plot there is to tie the action sequences together is very predictable and paper thin. Oh, need I even go into casting Cumberbatch as Khan! Well, I will. Simply, put horrible choice, but the casting for this movie and the first Abrams Star Trek is horrible. So why should things get any better?

How JJ Abrams keeps getting work is beyond me. All of his recent TV shows have flopped and he's never really made a decent movie. I don't know how many times I've heard the media refer to him as the ""master of science fiction"". Well, Abrams is a hack. I blame this movie's failings squarely on him.",1378944000,6,1066,4.494845360824742
5294177,5,B009934S5M,"First, let me begin by simply stating that this is a fantastic movie featuring a well-paced and authentic screenplay that takes advantages of the best audio and video production available.

The movie features a new villain, new in the sense those who watch the first movie (2009) have not met him before as well as introduces a number of characters and races we know in ways that are believable and fun. While at times the movie is predictable, the film includes some twists and turns that keep you enjoying the entire ride. While some fan favorites may not feature as central a role as one would hope, the characters all play an important role in making this a believable environment. For those with families, this would probably be good for anyone 10-12 years old or older. The movie features some lingerie (well, ""sexy"" underwear) and a few instances of profanity (s word being the worst). Obviously whether this movie is appropriate would depend on your family, but my personal opinion would be as stated above.

The audio in the movie is fantastic and features strong low frequency extensions (aka will make your subwoofer work) when ships go to warp and other events occur which I won't spoil for you. The highs are warm and vibrant and not shrill or harsh. The sound field envelopes you a few times in a full 360 experience for those with surround sound, with phasers firing, characters talking and action occurring on all sides. Overall, the Dolby HD track on the Blu-Ray would be considered a reference quality audio that is perfect to show off a home theater or to marvel at with your family. This is engaging and purposeful sound that truly transforms the experience.

The video is sharp and crisp, in beautiful 1080p (Blu-Ray version) with saturated colors where appropriate. The film benefits from a larger screen as you can get more details and can truly appreciate the scale and work that was put into this, but any device will do. There is a little bit of film grain (the little speckles on the picture) which is really only noticeable if looking for it on the darker scenes and in some of the fog like effects. Throughout the film, the camera is very close to the characters, showing detail and color, but can get a bit much if the constant camera motion bothers you. CGI was well done, and never appeared ""fake"", all of it blended well and felt like part of the set. For some viewers, you may want to watch this at night, or in a room that you can control the light as the sunlight on the TV may wash out some of the blacks, causing you to miss some of the detail that can be found in the dark colors and the blacks.

Overall, this film is a wonderful experience. It will stimulate all of your movie-goer senses (auditory, visual, and touch if you have a subwoofer). The script is well written, nicely paced, and albeit predictable at times, wholly enjoyable. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi, Action, and great character interaction.",1378944000,3,2983,4.643939393939394

Join vastly overrated director J.J. Abrams and comically inept writers Orci, Kurtzman, and Lindelof (seriously, will these guys take a break from ruining the Sci-Fi genre?) as they take one final stab at perverting the Star Trek brand before moving on to other, inevitably poorly done, Sci-Fi projects.

Watch as familiar characters are fleshed out...well, not at all, instead relying on throwing an occasional curveball at preconceived notions so that no more than the bare minimum of time is used to develop them.

Put aside your disbelief as transporter technology in the future will work solely as a lazy plot device, operating only as a means to set up the next silly action sequence. Suspend any knowledge of physics as well as your common sense for such scenes as: spaceship underwater, spaceship pulled out of orbit within seconds, characters foregoing use of shuttlecraft to approach disabled ship...and many...many...crushingly, many more. Most of all prepare yourself for the most stupidly unbelievable things of all, the characters motivations.

The costume designer's last apparent project was for the Imperial Officers from Star Wars - everyone in Star Fleet looked like some sort of space-age fascist villain - and marched like one, too. And the big hats - really. Rally? Even Augusto Pinochet would have laughed. The ending sequence was a cross between a 1960s Japanese monster movie and Space Balls. The producer obviously does not comprehend the gravity of a movie like Wrath of Khan. To even think about making some iteration of it is to flatter himself way beyond his talent, skill, or clearly knowledge level.

To be fair, very little could rise to Wrath of Khan - that film was arguably the pinnacle of the Star Trek franchise. But this doesn't even rise to the level of any of the other TOS films, the series itself, TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise or any other episode or film with the label Star Trek. Look for this film to reappear on the next episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Now I need to watch Wrath of Khan to clear my palate. Maybe the producer should, too, to see how it's done (even though he will never come close to emulating it).

And the actors were up to the task. Shatner and Nimoy were exceptional. Here, we get a scene that lacks that emotional punch and part of the problem is because the Kirk/Spock relationship doesn't have the history here that it did in the original series. I never really bought that Spock would, or should, feel such anger over someone he has not known that long.

Khan? A nice and interesting choice but doomed because Montalban is perhaps the best villain Star Trek ever produced. Any actor will suffer by comparison and maybe that is why another story would have worked better.

The rest of the cast is good, although I think Urban is underused as McCoy. He again manages to capture the elements of DeForest Kelley and still seem original. That's no easy task.

The film looks gorgeous, the effects are impressive, the score is fine.

Something that really bothers me, though, is the almost complete lack of military decorum. I mean they are the military. But most of the time they act like buddies hanging out. The original series was much more disciplined and, I think, realistic. Making someone CO of a starship straight out of the academy? I still laugh at that. Is Starfleet THAT desperate? I don't care how brilliant a person is, you cannot beat experience. Even Einstein had to work.

Maybe it is unfair to compare it to the original because by the time Wrath of Khan was released, they had over 70 episodes played over and over again throughout the country to build a relationship the viewers could connect with for well over ten years. This new cast has just two films. Maybe it would be better to watch this without having seen the original? Maybe so.

I still prefer the original, although I have to say I like this Trek much more than the other Trek series. It, at least, is daring, something almost entirely missing from TNG, DS9, Voyager and Enterprise.",1378857600,5,2166,4.642297650130549

And what a disappointing and boring Khan. When you think your going to see a modern Star Trek film with Khan in it you are naturally pumped, until you get a yawn fest with a preppie looking dude that could pass for a backround walk by extra.

I kept thinking, ""please don't let this guy be Khan"" or many variations of that with expletives included. Uhura lost her mojo from the first film, Scotty was over the top annoying with ""humor"" fit for a flopped SNL skit and Kirk turned in a listless portrayal. Forget Sulu and Chekov, they were cardboard embarrassments. Spock however still shined through, and was the only saving grace of the film.

Tons of sweeping camera shots that hoped to provide more substance then was actually before you abounded. The film makers also seemed hard pressed to keep the camera away from being aimed at any alien looking wanderers or crew members. Except for the midget with the plopped on stupid looking alien mask that drank with Scotty.

What happened to the Star Trek I know? The core was ripped out, I can tell you that. The film is visually pleasing at times but  it doesn't save a scene jumping tired old mess ripped  directly from a bad ""Next Generation"" episode. The film should have been titled, "" Star Trek- The Shooting of Phasers Part 1 (with minimal plot)"". Lets hope there's not a part 3 of this nature.",1378857600,4,1504,4.431159420289855

5294202,3,B009934S5M,"This is a  weaker film than the first -- a flashy but, especially through its long middle section, rather flaccid offering that would have benefited from a 30- or 40-minute edit.

That said, it does right itself in the last 45 minutes -- in itself an unusual event for any off-course movie -- and winds up being bland, general-purpose fun in the same way I imagine water parks are fun on a hot day.

I could quibble about the anonymous design of the action scenes (a template seen in far too many films lately), the writing -- moral considerations seem to have been doctored into a number of dialogs -- and overly glitzy production design. But my enduring caveat is that ""Into Darkness"" displays sadly little respect for the franchise's rich history.

Granted, the first Abrams film didn't either, but it got away with it  more effectively owing to the alternate-timeline plot. Here, ""Star Trek"" seems little more than a framework and set of characters to be drawn upon at will, irrespective of events in the original series and the earlier films, and less ""reboot"" than reinvention.

I can't expand upon this assertion without getting into spoilers, but, in the main, it comes down to the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the chief villain.

He is less than effective. I don't blame the actor. Cumberbatch did his best with what he was given -- and he does have one especially resonant scene -- but he was badly miscast in this particular part and for the worst Hollywood sorts of reasons. He should have had weight, and he has none. I wasn't intimidated by his character. I wasn't even interested in him.

Heck, I couldn't even identify him without the film telling me who he is.

And I should have been able to do so. His first closeup should have been one of those moments where all Star Trek fans draw in their breath and hold it for a second or two.

Then, at least, the film would have had one such moment.",1378857600,2,1915,4.573099415204679

The problem with this product is that the special features have been distributed between different retailers.  So what you get from this product is a 1:1 Starfleet Phaser, and 7 special features(on the blurry) which ads up to about 45 minutes of content.  Not exactly Christmas.  There are no deleted scenes, and most notably, NO DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY.

What's even more infuriating, is that there are 12 more special features out there, and Director's commentary.

On top of that, to get the Director's commentary, you'll have to download the movie from iTunes.
Fortunately, with the download code, you can download the movie from iTunes.

When spending $70 on a movie, I expect to have every single special feature included on my BluRay.  The fact that I only got 7 (special features) and no Director's commentary is a rip off.

I am really tired of action movies trying to feel like a first person shooter video game. And that's what I felt like, that I was inside a video game and I did't have a controller. I like special effects as much as the next person, but that is not enough to hold my attention. I want to hear a story. You can only watch so many space ships explode and men flying through space until it become predictable - nothing special anymore. Star Trek Into Darkness touched on a backstory, but it never took the time to really develop the the plot. I want to use my brain and not just watch action sequences.

Now, I have another version, but this one occurs in an alternate universe with new characterizations that I mostly do not care for, lots of eye candy SFX that doesnt add a tinkers cuss to the storytelling, and scenes designed merely for their appeal to puerile impulses by a director and studio/franchise holder that has given up attempting to tell a NEW story and is merely trying to extract more money from a cash cow.

I was invested in this film from the moment the enterprise rose out of the ocean.  The character development was spot on and I believed everything Spock felt and experienced.  These actors portraying the iconic characters of Trek are brilliant.  And I wish I could see them weekly on a new Trek show rather then every few years.
The soundtrack to this film rocks, and on my home theater, it was amazing.  Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing as Harrison, and brings a level of belief that Montalban never could.  Mr. Cumberpatch with few words is as dangerous as anything, and also with just a few words can show his love for his crew.  He is one of my new favorite actors.

Today, everyone is a director, a producer, a writer, and an actor.  Everyone knows how to make a move, but not how to enjoy a movie.  We have lost something with the dawn of the internet.  As a child I loved the movies, as it allowed you to escape into worlds only dreamed of.  And for 1-2 hours, we were entertained.  They were popcorn flicks.  Today, we tear films down, micro manage them and reject them before ever viewing one scene.

I feel sorry for Star Wars fans, as I am sure he will fail there as well.

Some movies that are ripped off : Raiders of the Lost Ark, Godfather 3, Matrix, True Lies, Revenge of the Sith, many others.

Things that don't make sense:  Tribbles are common instead of some exotic lifeform found much later ( well apparently Tribbles are now the rats of the universe
thanks to 'Enterprise', so I stand corrected ), Khan can beam himself all the way to Klingon home world from an exploding ship ( wow! he's smart ), magic seatbelts, shooting phasers at warp is no longer a problem, and cold fusion apparently can freeze a volcano.

All the attempts at some scientific explanation for all the things that happened in every previous episode of Star Trek was just thrown out the window.

I watched the movie again and found more things, like how is Khan 300 years old in 2259?  I guess mathematics in this country is a serious problem...

The Movie: The actual movie itself looks beautiful and sounds amazing. You get a digital copy, 3D Bluray, Standard Bluray and finally DVD. I like when vendors include all copies in one box.

The special features: Or rather lack there of. It comes with only a fraction of all the content available for this movie. Paramount purposely gave different vendors different content. The only way to get ALL of the extras is to buy it three times from BestBuy, Target and iTunes. This is extremely annoying because I purchased this ""special edition"" in hopes that it would be the end all be all version but you get more bang from your buck buying a normal edition.

The Phaser: The phaser looks good from a distance but on closer inspection it is really flawed. It has some nice weight to it but there are many unrefined edges and details. When you look at the phaser head on you can tell its crooked in several places. It does not spin from stun to kill automatically, you have to turn yourself and it doesnt turn smoothly nor does it lock into place. The ends of the barrels are warped and just don't look crisp. You can tell that this was mass produced and slapped together to ship out and sell as much as possible instead of being a collectible built for fans.  I love movie props but this really left me feeling cheated.

Over all I regret the money spent on this and would have probably enjoyed a standard edition from one of the other retailers more.

Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) is reduced in rank when he and the crew try and save a civilization threatened by a massive volcanic eruption. Kirk violated the Prime Directive in the process of saving these people and Spock's life. Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood--a great actor well cast)takes command of the Enterprise back from Kirk and convinces Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) to let Kirk be his First Officer while Spock is reassigned.

Deciminated by a terrorist attack by a former Star Fleet member John Anderson (Benedict Cumberbatch), Marcus allows Kirk to take command of the Enterprise to hunt down Anderson and kill him. Unforunately for Kirk and his crew they discover a conspiracy that leads back deep into the heart of Star Fleet putting them at risk from both their own and Anderson.

End of Spoilers:

The second film in the reboot for Star Trek isn't quite as consistent as the first but it does build on the characters.

How Does it Look? ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" looks marvelous with rich detail and depth to the image. The 3D version looks nice for a post-production conversion (it wasn't shot in 3D)but, at times, suffers from ""viewmaster syndrome"" i.e., while the image has depth it doesn't look as natural as 3D productions shot in the format. The dark look of the film also can be an issue at times but, overall, the 3D version looks pretty good.

The conventional Blu-ray has amazing depth, detail and I didn't note any artifacts on first viewing making this a demo disc for me.

The audio is lossless and sounds terrific. Audio is also presented in 5.1 for the following: French, Spanish and also has English Audio Description. We get subtitles in a variety of languages including English, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

The seven featurettes on included with the disc are solid but could have been far more indepth. We get the following featurettes that run from 2 to 8 minutes: Creating the Red Planet focuses on the opening sequence and how the world we see was created with CG and practical effects;Attack on Starfleet; The Klingon Home World focuses on the reimagined Klingon's;The Enemy of My Enemy features Abrams and Cumberbatch discussing the villian of the film; Ship to Ship with previz compared to final footage and Brawl by the Bay focusing on Spock's fight at the conclusion.

For a big title like this there is always the chance you're going to be double dipped and all those special features that were spread out among three different retailers will, later, show up in a deluxe edition. It just sucks that Paramount's marketing department has decided to do this to fans. It was an unfortunate decision on Paramount's marketing department that will prevent many fans from buying this as very few people will want to purchase three copies of the same movie on Blu-ray just to get all the special features.

""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" fuses elements of the reboot with a classic Trek bad guy and elements from other classic Trek episodes to create a compelling, entertaining fushion that touches on ""Trek"" as well as J.J. Abrams favorite movie ""Star Wars"". He does a pretty darn good job of fusing the two making Kirk a combination of the classic character we know and love with Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. While the characters of Spock and Uhura are given the Han Solo/Leia romance elements. Scotty seems to be Chewbacca.

An entertaining combination of ""Trek"" with Abrams other space opera influences (mainly ""Star Wars""), ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" displeased many long time ""Trek"" fans (it was voted one of the worst ""Trek"" films ever at a ""Star Trek"" website)but I think time will prove that to be incorrect.",1378857600,,3659,4.857142857142857

This was a good movie but, it did lose me in the middle but got me back with this villain. Another one to add to my collection.",1378857600,,795,3.7951807228915664

5294233,5,B009934S5M,"The cast from the first film return for the all new adventure of the starship Enterprise. Being the next reboot of the series on events from the first films, this one will strike the hearts or hatred of Trekkies with its retelling of ***SPOLIER***  The Wrath of Khan. Personally, I thought they did a fantastic job turning Sherlock's Benedict Cumberbatch into the representation of Khan as a more sane, plotting, and devious enemy over the somewhat meddened version from the original film. The casting remains excellent with all the key roles filled by ample talent and good performances, Quinto does a better performance as Spock, letting his more human side show both through attitude and action, letting us see an improvement to his character through more freedom in not being tied to the original Spocks emotional restrictions. Karl, Simon, Chris, and crew all do well, and the only issue with casting I have, is in Alive Eves role as the admirals daughter. First off, she is absolutely gorgeous. She also is an accomplished and skilled actress. However, her addition to the film struck me as uneeded. It felt she was placed here to eek by in an underlying role with just enough ties to the plot to make her relevant long enough to get a ""for no reason"" underwear shot.

As a red blooded male, it was... well fantastic, but for the film, seemed like a juvenile attempt at pulling the Geek and Gamers to the film by being able to use it in the preview and using her to sell extra tickets. Everything she did in the film, every relation she had in it, could have been removed completely, or replaced by existing cast, and it in no way would have impacted the film. For the Record, THIS IS A STAR TREK MOVIE, you had every self respecting nerd, geek, gamer, trekkie, and Sci-Fi fan preordering tickets before the first teaser finished playing. Do not insult us by thinking we need the blond bomshell in a skirt to compete the film experience. I found it rather distastefull of the franchise, and insulting to Ms. Eve, and hindering to the movie. I in no way dock the film for it, as it is not like I will not enjoy her scenes, just did not appreciate the lowbrow approach to her characters inclusion into the series.

Other than that small huge rant, I felt just about everything was improved over the first installment. Experiencing it in 3D boosts the enjoyment to new heights, and there is no shortage of CGI Eye Candy, the look at the rebooted Klingon was well done, with a happy medium between the original envisionment of them (if you do not know, go look that up lol) and the ""classic"" look most are used to. The characters meld and bounce off each other much smoother and the time they spent together through the first tale has really bonded them better both in dialogue and action, making a smoother film, with each being able to bring out more of the nuances of each individual. Things that friends do with each other that creates the familiarity with the characters and invests you more in the film.

I have no qualms about recommending the new reboot films to anyone, and see them only growing better in time. I would love however, to see them allow a new non-rebooted tale for the cast to stretch out with and make their own marks on the franchise instead of restricting them to follow in very big footsteps.

5294242,4,B009934S5M,"First, let me say I have been a fan of Star Trek since the first series was being broadcast the first time. I've watched all the shows and all the movies. I have seen some episodes and some movies which were awesome, and some which sucked. This one is squarely in the middle. If you were new to the series, this is probably an amazing film. Lot's of action, amazing effects. To me, however, I just can't stand the fact every time someone new comes along, they need to change the established. Like most fans, I accepted the Klingons when they were re-designed for the movies and then the subsequent television shows. Why in the hell did we have to redesign them again? Then, there is the U.S.S. Vengeance. Seriously, we are supposed to believe an Admiral is going off the reservation and building a ship like that without others knowing about it? And if it is an approved ship by Starfleet, I can't imagine it getting the name Vengeance. The Enterprise was a fairly new ship, commissioned just a couple years earlier and we are expected to believe it is that outclassed with new weapons and shields. Seriously, if the Admiralty is concerned about the Klingons enough to authorize the construction of the Vengeance, would they not be upgrading the fleet with improved weapons and shields, if not speed, as the technology becomes available? Enterprise was a new ship with a Captain who just recently saved the Earth from destruction, if that is not a ship likely to face immediate upgrades, I can't imagine which would.

And, why in the hell would they park the Enterprise under an ocean? What possible need would there be for something stupid like that? The fact they stopped the volcano was a violation of the Prime Directive, it's all they needed to get Kirk in trouble with Starfleet. They did not need to hide it under a damned ocean. It would be out of sight in orbit.

I liked the idea of a reboot, it freed the new series of movies to run in new directions without having to worry about keeping up with almost 50 years of established ""history"". But, let's be honest, a change in the timeline would not affect the look of the Klingons. Maybe their ships, though frankly, I don't really see that either, since the timeline change affected mostly the Federation. And what the heck was that with the exploding moon around Kronos? Seriously? We know it did eventually become unstable and receive damage, but, again, that would not have happened at such an accelerated pace because of the affects of the first movie.

Oh, and I appreciate the nod to the troops, nice to see from Hollywood, but, no missing scenes? A couple of the cut scenes were very important to the first film, I wonder what else is missing from this film that would fix a few gaps.

The good, as I said, it's got a lot of action, a lot of great effects. If you don't take the science to seriously and know nothing of the first 48 years of Star Trek, you'll probably love this movie. The scene of the Enterprise rising out of the ocean and later rising from the clouds, reminiscent of the rising from the dust cloud in space, is beautiful, and if you suspend your imagination, you'd enjoy it. The actors are great, the story is certainly interesting. Again, you have to avoid giving it any thought, but, frankly, most action movies suffer from that as well. I wish the creative team would try to keep some things the way we fans have grown to love it, but, it was a fun movie. I look forward to the next one.",1378857600,2,3476,4.512698412698413

I'm no trekkie, but I truly enjoy Star Trek and have been for several years, and I believe J.J. Abrams recent Star Trek films are incredible additions to the franchise and do them the utmost justice.
Both the reboot films have made me cry early in, which I was not expecting upon beginning wither of them, and thats not something the older films did easily or often.
Suffice to say, I rather hope these can be continued to made with as much care and consideration as they have been.
Also, looking forward to J.J. Abrams direction of the 7th Star Wars film coming in a few years. I think, after watching these films, he will do an incredible job with it.

The movie itself is 5 star, and a must buy, if you don't care about extra features.

The original series also had Kirk and Spock dress up in disguise and sneak around places incognito, very happy to see that in this movie.

I know you want to. I want to too. BUT DON'T BUY IT!
Paramount completely missed the mark when they thought it would be a good idea to split up all the special features, created by the filmmakers, FOR US FANS by giving different bonus features to different retailers. So no commentary (even though it exists) on some disks, and limited on the others.  And only a small portion of the other special features.  There are five featurettes on the Target release. The five on the Best Buy version are completely different. So there are actually 10 featurettes altogether, approximately an hour's worth of material, missing from the general release, plus the iTunes-exclusive commentary mentioned. You don't get any of that on this disk!!

What does this mean? If you want all the special features created for this release, you have to buy 3 different versions of the blu-ray plus the itunes version (for the director's commentary).

Don't let these idiots take advantage of you. While it really sucks to not be able to own this sci-fi gem, or the 3D one I've been waiting to buy, The best way to show these morons what we the fans think of this low-ball cheap idea,  is to not buy this movie.

So I've decided to forgo purchasing any version of this release.
The Movie:  I really liked this re-boot ST movie more than the first one.  For me, and most Star Trek fans, the real selling point for wanting to purchase the blu-ray were the bonus features (of which there were plenty on the first J.J. Abrams Star Trek film).

The fact is, there are several other current and upcoming blu-ray releases that I could purchase instead where I would get more bang for my buck.",1378771200,11,1803,4.59190031152648
5294263,2,B009934S5M,"I don't know what all these great reviews are about.  They seem to be about the special FX or the 3D or what ever.  My impression of the STORY LINE is that this is NOT, REPEAT NOT AN ACTUAL STAR TREK representation.  For someone who was fortunate to watch the REAL Star Trek with Caption James T. Kirk, Mr. Spock and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, these cartoon characters do not come close to representing that classic TV series.  This Star Trek should be called Alternate Universe Star Trek.  Simply put, the movie is ILLOGICAL.  The time sequencing is screwed up. WHY: In this version, Khan encounters the Enterprise, when the Crew had just been assembled.  And rather then Khan and his genitically altered crew being put on a distant planet, they were put into a frozen state?  So a past event occurred before a future event, but that out of sequence event coincided with the initial launching of the Enterprise, which was the ship that was used to maroon Khan and his people.  Then there is Old Spock speaking to young Spock about a past event, that is reoccuring, HUH?  Sorry but this is just another rip off of the extreem creative ability that America had at one time.  Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek and it was successful, so now rather then write a NEW level based on that success, the creaters of this ""version"" decided to recreate the characters and attempt to steal the greatness that the series once had.  To give credit where credit is due, this BOGUS cartoon Star Trek is an entertaining movie, but you must forget all that you know about the REAL Star Trek series.  I wonder why JJ Abrams did not make a ""future"" version of the highly successful series by creating new characters with NEW names.  I guess that it is much easier to steal thunder then create it on your own.

Movies that are reboots of a franchise are always tricky, and then taking it a step further and making the reboot a franchise of its own can be even trickier. That is probably even more the case when the franchise is Star Trek. This does what all sequels strive to do (yet which many cannot) actually improve on the original movie.

Like the first movie it blended action, drama, and humor. There was not a lot of character development in this movie since it was already done in the last one, but if you saw the first movie this one does not require a lot of set up. While all of the actors did remarkably well in their various roles the standout performance was Benedict Cumberbatch. They kept his role as much as a secret as possible when filming but  it is well known that he played Khan, the most formidable villain in the original series. He stole every scene he was in and brought presence to the screen every time he was on. As good as he is in the BBC series Sherlock, he as just as good playing one of the ultimate bad guys in the Star Trek universe. Zachary Quinto's portrayal of Spock continued to be very well done, and he does a great job playing homage to the character that Nimoy (who has a small cameo in the film) created, but making the role his own.

Like the first movie this one has twists on the events from the original series show and movies. Even though some of the scenes were similar to things that happened in the show and the movies (some in a joking way, and others as major plot points)since the timeline was changed in the first movie things do not play out exactly as expected. In fact in more than one instance the roles of Kirk and Spock are flipped in situations that occurred in The Wrath of Kahn.

The movie definitely sets up themes for the next movie, including introducing the Klingons and leaving open the possibility of Khan's return. The ""main"" events of this movie are all resolved by the end though so there was no definitive set up for what is to come, just hints. While it is inevitable that the movies will run out of steam at some point, J.J. Abrams has done a great job with the franchise so far, and if he maintains this quality and can keep the main actors on, then he can definitely get a lot more out of it. Personally I would love to see him introduce the Borg into this timeline, but that remains to be seen.

The A/V quality of the blu ray is great, and the special effects are as good or better than in the first movie. As many have pointed out the extras you get depend on where you buy the movie. Different retailers discs have different special features. There will almost inevitably be some ultimate edition kind of release down the road that will combine them all, so if you are really into getting as many bonus features as possible, then you may want to wait. The stuff that is included in the Amazon release are fine, but there is more out there.

In all I think your enjoyment of the movie itself will come down to whether you are a fan of the Star Trek franchise or just like sci-fi movies in general. If you fall into the latter category I think you can definitely find this enjoyable. If you are in the former, and can accept that the movie does change things that happened in the original story you will like it. Whether you want to shell out for the discs will probably depends on where you fall on the issue of the special features.  I think it warrants knocking the overall rating down a star because of the decision to split all the bonus material.  The movie itself is worth seeing but if the special feature issue bugs you then you probably want to stick with a rental or streaming.",1378771200,5,3789,4.325352112676057

5294274,5,B009934S5M,"The first STAR TREK reboot was something refreshing.  Pleasing enough to fans, a delightful film to those like me who only had a fleeting brush with the TREK legacy.  It featured a freshly complex plot (which demanded repeated viewings), superb acting, brilliant effects, and the stubborn mastery of J. J. Abrams, whom love or hate, always does things his own way.  What the first TREK lacked, however, was a villain.

Enter INTO DARKNESS.  When a nobody, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), declares all-out war on Star Fleet Command, it prompts panic, confusion, and terror.  James Kirk (Chris Pine) finds himself behind the helm of the Enterprise once more, with his trust crew in tow.  As he wrangles yet again with his personality foil Spock (Zachary Quinto), Kirk faces the greatest challenge of his young life: a mission of vengeance and nobility, once where darkness lurks in the most unlikeliest of places...and death waits for no man.

Okay, melodrama aside, STARK TREK INTO DARKNESS is a fantastic film.  The acting is on-par with, if not better than, the first (ignoring Eric Bana's unusually wooden turn as that film's villain).  Pine gets to show a little more range, as does Quinto; meanwhile, Simon Pegg gets in some nice zingers, and Bruce Greenwood has a few great moments.  One nice surprise here is Peter Weller, as the Star Fleet commander; it's nice to see him in a prominent role again, getting some nice material to chew through.

But of course, the talk is all about Cumberbatch.  The entire cast (especially Pine, Greenwood, Quinto, and Weller) deserves high praise...but a deliciously delightful villain always steals the show.  There's not exactly anything we haven't seen before; rather, it's we haven't seen it on this high-tech of a scale: a solid, menacing performance set against high-octane action and brilliant special effects.  What's more, for the uninitiated, the role is an unpredictable one.  The film as a whole throws a few nice knocks, and some interesting homages.  J. J. Abrams and company are keen to keep old fans while recruiting new ones.  STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS isn't an original film, per say (part of that is intentional, understand); but it's still a refreshing one, with great performances, great effects, and a killer plot.  If you like your popcorn films made by talented people who actually put thought into what they're doing, this one's for you.",1378771200,,2407,5.017632241813602
5294275,4,B009934S5M,"No question, the movie is great and if you saw it in the theater of course you'll buy it.  So the question is, should I pay the extra $50 for the phaser?  Well, just so you know the coloring of the phaser I received is not exactly the same as the picture.  The picture shows a dark grey almost black cover to the phaser while the actual color is a very light grey - lighter than almost any other part of the phaser.  The flip around muzzle (between kill and stun setting) moves manually as stated.  No button to flip it around.  And there is no trigger for the phaser.  How they fired it without a trigger in the movie is beyond me, but that can probably be explained away by Trek technology.  The muzzle is very slightly off kilter in stun mode where it lifts up, but I imagine that's how it holds in place so nicely instead of freely spinning.  Overall, it's a very nice replica with very solid construction.  It feels heavy in your hand (not in a bad way but in a high quality way).  This is not some cheap toy but a very precise model.  If you have always wanted a phaser, this is a great one to get.  Is it worth $50?  Yes, but only for the hard core Star Trek fan who wants the collectible.  Otherwise, stick to getting the $20 version.",1378771200,5,1242,4.138075313807532
5294276,2,B009934S5M,"To begin with, this rating concerns only the phaser that is included with the collector's edition.  The blu-ray itself is the same as is sold separately, and the reviews for that product can be seen elsewhere.

Frankly, the phaser that came with my collector's edition is of fairly poor quality.  It may be a fluke, others may have a different experience, but I'm badly disappointed.  To begin with, the magnetic spinning barrel has no mechanism to cause the spin other than manually spinning it with your fingers.  I expected the spin to be triggered by a trigger pull or a button press, but that was an assumption on my part so I mention it merely to inform others who may have thought the same.  Secondly, the paint that is used on the red barrel is applied unevenly and the silver shows clearly through it on one side.  Lastly, and most importantly, the various pieces of the phaser seem to be glued together without any real care taken to get the alignment right.  As a result, the top and bottom portions of the barrel guard do not line up correctly, multiple pieces appear to be twisted oddly off axis, and the spinner doesnt spin freely.  Instead the larger of the two barrels catches on the top barrel guard and has to be forced into place, rubbing pieces together with considerable force.  Additionally, the magnets that hold the barrel into its resting positions are misplaced such that the barrel appears to pointed considerably left of center by default.

The whole thing looks reasonably decent if you leave it on a stand and view it from a distance, but considering the additional cost of the collector's edition I would have expected a much higher quality item.  I will be returning this and getting the blu-ray on its own.",1378771200,10,1739,4.665573770491803

From QmX:
""The hero props in the movie have a servo-powered spinner to change the intensity setting from ""stun"" to ""kill""; our replica is spring-loaded with an active locking mechanism that snaps the spinner neatly in place.""

Snapps... kind of but not really, it stops in Stun position but is loose in the Kill position, there is a magnet and detent in the Stun only. you must use your hand to swivel it from Stun To Kill. It is a Hero type prop with no electronic sound or action other then the manual swivel, the energy level dial is cast and does not move. The buttons are cast in place as well.

5294281,4,B009934S5M,"I've been a fan of the Star Trek films and TV series for many years now. My favorite of the films remains Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home--but I've really enjoyed J.J. Abrams' take on the Trek universe. What I've loved most about this franchise overall, however, is not the sci-fi elements or the adventure or the special effects (which were amazing!), but the characters. The crew of the Enterprise is a wildly diverse group that has somehow produced just the right chemistry. They're not just a crew, they're a family. In the face of overwhelming danger, they come together in the way families do.

I'm pretty sure this is no longer a secret, so no spoiler alert--in Star Trek: Into Darkness, Kirk and company have their first face-off with the notorious Khan, who appears on Earth with an offer to help a couple whose child is dying. He can save her, he promises. But his offer comes with a price...one that will lead to the deaths of many members of Starfleet, including Kirk's mentor, Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Kirk and the Enterprise crew set off in pursuit.

The young Captain James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) is what anyone familiar with the character in his later years would expect: brash, stubborn, daring--but always with the best intentions. And with a middle name like Tiberius, one can assume he learned to fight at an early age. He is, as Admiral Pike puts it, Starfleet's ""only genius-level repeat offender.""

Spock (Zachary Quinto), by contrast, is still trying to be all Vulcan, in spite of his half human side. Kirk brings out that human side, which frustrates Spock. Kirk has a nasty habit of giving a single-finger salute to logic. He might not break the rules, but he'll bend them beyond recognition, the way Uri Geller used to bend spoons.

The negatives? I was disappointed that a pivotal scene from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was borrowed in this movie, reversed to have Kirk dying to save the Enterprise as Spock did in that film. If one is going to rewrite Trek history, don't include retread scenes! Also, I never bought into the relationship between Spock and Uhura--there was never anything in the original series to even hint at such a relationship, and it seemed to me it was contrived to give the character a stronger presence in the story. It wasn't necessary. Uhura is and always was a great character without the romance angle.

All of the actors (Pine, Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Anton Yelchin are spot-on in their roles. (Okay, I do have one question: how is it that Scotty, in his later years, has so much more hair than young Scotty? He really is a miracle-worker--or those 23rd-century replicators are just that good!) Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan brings just the right degree of brilliance and menace to the role. I would have preferred he be a more complex villain, like Tom Hiddleston's Loki in Thor and The Avengers, but still I'm glad the character wasn't killed off--there's always the possibility he'll return in a future installment (and I do hope there will be future installments).",1378771200,2,3074,4.7706766917293235

The pictures are sharp but have a cinema feel to it, which I like a lot. The sound effect for explosions,fire fights, space flights, are all clearly articulated. I can hear the distribution of the sound pieces from different speakers.

3D is like in theater. The in-screen depth are pretty good in many places. The out-of-screen is minimal, but there is one memorable scene at the opening sequence, when the Nibirians throw spears at Kirk and Bones. I felt they were coming at me and gonna hit between my eyes!

You only see this when shopping the Instant Video, not DVD or BluRay.

I didn't know who the guy was when I saw this the first time, and spent half an hour trying to figure out just who the hell it was. When the story finally unfolds and reveals the relevant information, it was an real epiphany, and it made the movie a lot more interesting for me.

What Amazon has done with this careless blurb is akin to Homer Simpson walking out of Empire Strikes Back and blurting out in front of the people in line: ""Who would've believed that Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father?""

Again, ""Into Darkness"" is top notch, and I highly recommend it for anybody who enjoys Star Trek in any form.

But ""Into Darkness?"" Aptly named. It's just terrible. I'd like to try to find something positive to say. But there isn't anything.

Khan was a tedious villain - but I'd put that down to Montalban's less than great acting.

Nope.

Cumberbatch - a great actor - is as tedious and one dimensional as the original could ever have been.

But that's minor.

This Star Trek film lacks one thing that every great movie needs.

A plot.

There isn't one. Just a collection of endless, tedious, predictable action sequences.

The great ensemble cast from the first film?

Forgotten. After all, having any actual acting or characterization would have taken a few precious minutes away from the 2 hours of chases, fights, explosions, and mayhem.

So there's no plot. No acting. No characterization. We don't bring the main villain in until half way through the movie, and then do nothing with him.

I bought this. Spent $15. That was a mistake. But I won't make it again.

And after all the TNG movies which were like 2 hour TV episodes, not really movies, the were disappointing with the small exception of the TNG Nemesis, which was badly acted but the story was good. Into Darkness will allow Kahn's character to maybe even have more development than it ever did before, since his demise isn't complete at the end. I know some Trekkies will disagree. But this movie is well-paced, has a complicated story-line, and leaves some opening for revisiting the best villain Capt Kirk ever faced. It reminds you that the worst villain is the one you can see yourself being. That's what Benedict Cumberbatch's Kahn does to our new Captain Kirk. He reminds him that certain qualities admired in some, can become very easily the reason to become the worst. person. ever. Thin lines between love/loyalty and hate/betrayal.

And now of course, we'll get the story of Capt Kirk and Dr. Carol Marcus, with whom he had a son in other universe, so now the timeline of that can be that his son lives in the future! Which I happen to think is a good thing. But JJ Abrams has only covered maybe a year of Enterprise time, so how long before we can expect to see the return to a weekly series JJ-style, in the timelines now established, in which there is a New Vulcan, will pon-farr still be an issue for a people whose original home-world is gone and they need to repopulate?

Anyway let's put that aside as this is what Star Trek is now. The first film was ok as an action teen flick set in space and this continues along the same lines.

And for me that's the big problem with it. It feels like a bunch of kids playing at spaceships, the characters aren't convincing. Spock isn't too bad and Peter Weller does a reasonable job as the admiral. Some of the characters (Scotty in particular) are just too silly to take seriously.

Ok, so it's not a serious film, but the problem is that it has a feel of a high budget comedy that isn't funny. Everyone is trying to keep a straight face, but the audience doesn't get what they find funny.

What the film does deliver however is an audio visual treat. It looks stunning and sounds superb and to be fair it's worth watching for the spectacle of it alone. It drags on a little bit, but not too much. I didn't like it, but I was entertained by it. I was glad I rented rather than bought it though.",1378598400,3,1113,4.119815668202765

But at the same time there were a number of serious flaws with the movie that I have a hard time overlooking but I'll limit myself to two.

1) Kirk throws up his hands and gives up. The Kirk I grew up appreciating never gave up. He took no win scenarios and turned them into victories. But in the bleakest moment in this movie Kirk almost literally turns to his crew and says ""Welp, sorry. I guess we're all gonna die now...""

2) The abuse of Trek tech to thoughtlessly move the plot forward. I won't go into detail here because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it but I will say this. There are two instances in the movie where the writers essentially took the easy way out of plot problems by abusing tech, and furthermore the way they do it breaks the universe. One involves teleportation and the other wraps up the end of the movie. This would have been fine if we were talking about some generic sci-fi action movie but not as Star Trek.

As a long-time Trek fan, and my feelings about JJ Abrams' version(s) remains mixed. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Blu-ray/dp/B00471JSRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek [Blu-ray</a>]
So this is a review based on first viewing / first impressions.

In terms of quality, this movie is all over the place. And so is its plot. Plot-lines are dropped, and the conspirators' evil plot(s?) never really make any sense, partially because none of it ever really comes together in the end. And, yes, yet again, the action occasionally gets way over the top, sometimes adding to the nonsensical feel of the movie. There's also a nice little brief encounter with (quasi-Goth??!!) Klingons.

<<<SPOILER PARAGRAPH: My biggest problem comes later in the film -- what starts as a nice parallel to movie 2 (WoK) becomes another travesty, another example of Trek's refusal to permanently kill off a main character. A great dramatic opportunity gets utterly wasted by a last-minute super-miraculous (even by 23rd-century standards) cure. Dammit! And so we end up with a mega-overdone-Angry Spock (tm), just so he can lose control enough to get into a massive brawl and beat the tar out of the villain. Jeez, talk about a letdown. The first half was --however haltingly-- potentially leading into a riveting story (albeit re-using a bunch of characters and concepts from ST2), only to waste weepy time on a false death and lead into a literally overkill fight sequence, and more brutal action facing up against a super-militarized starship.

The visuals are generally nice, the score's okay, the character dynamics usually remain entertaining, and Cumberbatch's character is pretty interesting. The blonde admiral's daughter (I won't give away her name, though others might) is almost a good character. That's about it, really.

Neither the worst nor the best of the Trek movies; at first blush, I'd rank it somewhere in the middle. Despite logic gaps and some bad dramatic choices, the next (and probably last with this cast) Trek movie might just manage to be the best of these three, if the writer(s) can just work a little harder at making all of the action and drama gel consistently next time.",1378425600,2,3066,5.582795698924731
5294353,2,B009934S5M,"Buyer beware. Not all special features included.

Although this is a somewhat polarizing Star Trek film that leaves most hard core Trek fans seething, I enjoyed the film myself. I was happy to pre-order as soon as it became available here on Amazon until I researched the extras elsewhere and found the disturbing news that Paramount has decided to sprinkle exclusive extras around to the different retailers. Therefore, when you buy the blu-ray here on Amazon there are many extras you are not going to get. In order to collect all the special features you would probably have to buy at least 3 copies - all from different retailers. This is completely unacceptable as one of the special features you will NOT receive with the Amazon Blu-Ray is the audio commentary. I could almost excuse the mostly throwaway featurettes. But the audio commentary? That should be included on every single Blu-Ray hard copy you buy (unless, of course, it is a movie only release). As it stands, I believe only itunes and the Target 4 disc edition include the audio commentary (although they have made it so difficult to find out what extras are included where that it would be like a scavenger hunt to collect all the extras). As it stands Amazon is not listed as one of the retailers to include the audio commentary.

Paramount and other studios are expected to continue this trend on future releases (I believe World War Z is the next major release to divide important supplemental material amongst various retailers) and I would advise any Blu-Ray collector to boycott any such release until they stop this disturbing practice.

I was looking forward to this film arriving at my door on release day but have cancelled my order in protest. Buying a retail copy of a major studio release should grant you the additional material no matter where you choose to buy it. As a loyal Amazon customer that is my retailer of choice. I will not buy any copy of this film as a result of this major slap in the face to fans of the film and Blu-Ray collectors alike.",1378425600,2,2039,4.689944134078212

I was quite annoyed. SO, I will NOT be getting this Blu-ray specifically and only to protest the lack of respect and greediness that Paramount has shown its customers. The audio commentary being only available on iTunes is a slap-in-the-face in and of itself. I'd post links to the relevant sources but apparently Amazon doesn't like external links. Well just look up den of geek and into darkness blu-ray on google for the full lowdown on this deception.

5294420,1,B009934S5M,"I had the 3d blu ray preordered since it was announced.  I do not even currently own a 3d television but some of the visuals of this film made me want to own the Premiere edition of this release, and that includes 3d as my next home theater setup may well include that ability.  I had high hopes that this would be another thoroughly impressive and immersive release as was ST 2009.

Then I started reading various reports of the smattering of special features, VAM and the like.  The straw that broke the camel's back was the iTunes exclusive commentary track.  This is not Amazon's fault, and it is not Amazon's responsibility to announce to their customers how the version of the product they are selling compares to other retailers, so I'm adding my voice in disapproval to how Paramount and Bad Robot have mangled this release and the overall lack of information and disclosure as to how hobbled the various releases are.  There is no definitive release of this film.

Compare this to how Blade Runner was released on blu ray, with every feature, version, commentary and documentary presented together in one complete collection.  I expect a blu ray worth purchasing to include all reasonably available material.  Blu ray is marketed as the ultimate experience of owning and viewing a film at home, and that has always included access to 'extra' material.  But with Into Darkness, one would have to purchase multiple releases of the same movie to have a complete package, and even then, the commentary track (arguably the most interesting 'feature') will only be available on iTunes, including the only US release of the variable aspect ratio of IMAX footage.

I write this to both inform, and express my dissatisfaction in hopes that others will be warned to purchase wisely and do the appropriate research, I also hope that representatives of Amazon, Paramount, and/or Bad Robot will read and understand the displeasure of like-minded fans and consumers who want nothing more than to be able to fairly and honestly purchase a single, uncompromised product.",1378166400,74,2563,4.808656036446469

In case none of you noticed. Amazon is getting what none of the retailers are getting which is the DVD with a phaser replica. FYI Paramount isn't the only one that does this. This is standard practice with all studios. Why? Contracts and deals. Retailers pay the studios for exclusive content which means that legally, other retailers aren't allowed to receive those DVD's with all that stuff. Amazon gets many exclusives that no one else can get. I admit this is a half assed way of releasing a DVD but look at it this way, with the popularity of Blu Ray, extra features are no longer on regular DVD's. Those are now bare bones and no one complains about that. :)",1378166400,,1592,5.061068702290076

I'm definitely in agreement with the public, as this movie was visually and intellectually captivating. Enough intrigue to keep you glued to the screen, paired with an equal amount of endearing character development, stunning visuals, and plot twists to make this one definite a ""Re-Watcher."" As most Negative reviews focus on a ""hating of the man"" perspective, directed at JJ Abrams and Bad Robot, you can rest assured that this movie will not disappoint if you actually are watching it as a theatrical film, and not with a conspiracy theorist's or hippie's chip on your shoulder.

As a long-time Trekkie, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing this series mature. Sure it skips over the hard-core geek stuff, but in the end, it helps spread the world of Star Trek to our non-geek friends, without letting us down in the important areas. Again, 10 out of 10.

But mainly it's because the characters don't seem as believable as the other movies. The whole time I watched this I kept getting distracted by how bad the acting is. Also the characters don't make me feel anything. Keeping in mind that this is Science Fiction the other movies at least let you get to know the characters and let you feel that what they were going through was really happening. Not with these last two movies sadly. They probably should have made a movie about Star Trek Voyager instead. But oh well.

She is still aswesome on her own, but she is not ensembling as well as the other 3. I hope they remake every single orignal episode whith these actors. How will they resolve the Time paradoxes though?  They can't make too many more with Vulcan as gone... it doesn't compute, isn't logical.

5294449,3,B009934S5M,"Movie companies, in order to lessen their risk will look at something great and try to recreate it. If a particular movie has a great laugh 5 min into it, you better believe the sequel will have one in the same spot. That is why sequels are less and less original as they go along. When will Hollywood learn?
  To many, this franchise needed an overhaul. The 2nd installment to the new look should be quite disappointing to true Trek fans. The score was great, the actors did a great job with what they had. Chris Pine, I thought played a great role. Alice Eve was an excellent choice for Carol Marcus. What I cannot fathom to understand ** SPOILER ALERT** is that great things were done once before, why can't it happen again. The 1st movie relied on the idea of the Kobiashi Maru, which the remake didn't even dive into the whole ""I don't believe in the no-win scenario."", which again came from the 1980's Khan movie. Movie companies keep coming up with the idea of,""yeah that worked in the 1st movie, put it in there this time."" This is why the ship has its core knocked off line, and someone has to go into the radiation chamber to save the ship and die, all the while being separated by the glass, and using mostly the same lines as the 1980's Khan movie. Does any of this sound familiar?? The 1980's version of the Wrath of Khan is probably one of the best sci-fi movies to date, in my opinion. It is great, for many reasons. This movie took a carbon copy of some of the famous lines, along with the same scenarios and made a less than original re-make. Spock dies in the Ricardo Montalban version. It's another reason why its great. The audience is left pondering, ""But isn't how we deal with death as least as important as how we deal with life...Just words, but good words. And that's where ideas begin...""
Chris Pine dies for a total of 5 minutes, but is resurrected. You kind of get everything in one movie. Sad, but not to worry, we won't really kill him. UUHHHHH! Stop giving me the one-stop-shop. The Wrath of Khan is a great movie, leave it be. You want to create another great movie, fine, do it. But stop borrowing from other greatness. It only cheapens this movie. And, on a final note, William Shatner has about 10 different ways to sell you a line. And he sold me on Wrath of Khan. Sorry, but these guys repeating them with less enthusiasm and less meaning, because you didn't bother to take time to set up the message on why that's important, just missed the boat.",1378080000,5,2485,4.388286334056399

5294463,2,B009934S5M,"I have never considered myself a Star trek fan, but if you are of a certain age, you grew up during a time when there was very little futuristic shows/movies and near zero fantasy.  The quality was often cheesy poor.  But there was so little, most scifi/fantasy fans watched most of what came out.

I only watched Star Trek (2009) at the insistence of a friend who lent me the DVD.  I thought it a well done movie, despite yet another application of time travel to breath life into the tired old Trek universe.

I saw Star Trek Into Darkness in 3D in the theaters and I was very disappointed.

First the lens flares.  They are everywhere.  I wonder if you can go 30 seconds without a lens flare appearing.  Sometimes they cover the actors faces.  At one point I wanted to reach up and clean the screen cause I couldn't see what was going on because a lens flare obscured the bottom of the screen.  It was like an amateur got a hold of a lens flare plug-in for the editing software and used it everywhere for no good reason. Look I can put one here... and here... and here.  When the visual direction of the film is that distracting from the movie--you're in trouble.

Too many times I was thrown by the script and realized I was sitting in a theater watching a movie with silly stuff in it. I *LOVE* suspension of disbelief.  I *LOVE* a movie that takes me along for the ride.  This kept failing. So disappointing.

When the lens flares aren't obscuring the screen there are decent special effects.  Multiple ridiculous situations, but the effects are up to par.  The Enterprise takes an amazing number of hits, exploding pieces, crew flying out hull breaches.  But, hey, lots of explosions and lasers.  If you know the Star Trek universe, prepare to discard what you know about Trek ""science"" and ""technology.""  Science is gone.  Honestly, any of my Science teachers from High School would have shredded obvious things in this script.  This is Harry Potter in Space, the Final Frontier.  All the rules have clearly changed--science and common sense be damned.  It looks cool on screen!!

If you can set your brain to stunned and just ride the fluff, there are the good moments. The tear-jerking moment is well played (although I imagine some will see it as ripoff/repeat, not homage). A few laughs, sometimes at the expense of the plot.  Solutions are whipped up and executed in, what seems, a fraction of the time it would actually take. I wave my wand, Stupefy!

So disappointing.

I heard that this was a homage/remake of Wrath of Khan.  I must say, the original is better, EVEN WITH all the melodramatic overacting.  Montalban balances out Shatner in the over acting area nicely.

The plot is bad. I actually became confused and was unsure if I understood which bad guy's plan orchestrated what during the movie. The opening scene shreds Star Trek canon.  The prime directive has no value and no ones cares a crap about it.  All the discussions about it are blathering and meaningless.  Clearly, no one cares in Starfleet.  Is ""cold fusion"" supposed to be ""cold"" and freeze volcanoes?  Obviously planetary physic are different in this universe. Cap a volcano and it will never bother you again.  Never mind that volcanoes ARE mountain-capped magma streams.  Did the Cold Fusion freeze the mantle core too?  Spock IS BAD AT SCIENCE!!!  We have drones today, but the only way to detonate the bomb is to lower you into the volcano with the bomb.  CRANK CRANK, mover levers.  You can now transport (in a straight line) across the galaxy to the dark side of a moon from inside a flying car.  Go Go Gadget!  And the dumbness of the characters just continues through the plot.  Kirk and Spock must be oblivious because otherwise how will we setup the next scene?

There are a few scenes where the banter definitely gets a smile, but sometimes it is accompanied by eyerolls at the ridiculous placement.  For instance, seconds before confronting a brilliant mass-murdering terrorist who is 91% likely to try and destroy them, Uhura starts a ""couple fight"" with her boyfriend.  The brilliant captain can only muster a humorous ""don't put me in the middle.""  Their behavior threatens the mission.  Really? That's the best the script could do for humor?  They took Uhura from this smart and capable woman to stereotypical hormonal, uncontrolled, ranting girlfriend.  I was waiting for a finger snap.  Two steps back.  The banter would have been funny anywhere.  In a life-threatening and mission-critical moment--it shows how bad they are at their jobs.  Yes, I hear the fanboys.  Yes, you're right, it is just a silly fantasy film, nothing is real and none of what happens matters in the least bit.  That's why death in this movie has no value to the plot or the audience.

At the end of the movie I thought, James T. Kirk should NEVER be given a Captain's chair again.  He isn't a leader in this movie.  He's a cowboy who dies a cowboy.  As much as I like Chris Pine, this script made the character dumb and reckless.  Does he EVER follow an order?  And Spock is dumb as well.  He can't think on his own and asks his own personal ""oracle"" to tell him the answer.  Really?

I've seen people call this a franchise killer and I thought that was probably just the extremist wanting another regurgitation of ST:TOS or ST:NG. But having seen it, I don't see this as adding any strength to the franchise.  I think on rewatch, this movie will wear thinner.",1377993600,10,5558,4.631416837782341

Don't buy this blu-ray. Paramount marketing thought it would be a good idea to make retailers feel special (not amazon though) and split up all the special features, created by the filmmakers, for the fans. So no commentary (even though it exists). And only a small portion of special features.

What does this mean? If you want all the special features created for this release, you have to buy 3 different versions of the blu-ray plus the itunes version (for the director's commentary).

This is not a good practice to support. Don't let these idiots take advantage of you. While it sucks to not be able to own this sci-fi gem, look at the release calendar for paramount following this. Expect similar practices for World War Z.

5294470,5,B009934S5M,It is definitely a breath of fresh air in a classic that will endure the test of time as long as we have brilliant minds to carry on the legacy to new generations. I loved the first and even more this one. Please keep them coming. The cast has done a FANTASTIC job stepping into legends shoes and yet adding so much to their character and so has the director pushed the boundaries of creation to entertain the old and new. Star Trek Forever.,1377993600,,441,4.261904761904762
5294471,2,B009934S5M,"There were certainly positive aspects to this film. The effects were well-conceived, the pacing was brisk and it didn't have a sagging middle act like the first nu-Trek movie did.  Cumberbatch was charismatic if a little two-dimensional. Each of the main characters got their ""moment"".

But the fundamental problem with Into Darkness is the same problem most of the Star Trek films have had since Wrath of Khan - the attempt to shoehorn a science fiction adventure franchise into a standard heroes-and-villians action movie. I'm not saying Khan wasn't a great movie, but it should not have become the template for all the Trek films to follow. That's why Star Trek always worked better as a tv series, because it gave the writers the freedom to explore unusual and challenging ideas and to focus on characters instead of spectacle. The people who made this movie, slick and glossy as it is, have no interest in the kind of Trek Gene Roddenberry originally envisioned. There is no depth, no new or interesting ideas just a lot of hollow superficial nods to what people love about Star Trek.

I guess what is especially insulting is that they can't even be bothered to create a new kind of villain. They just keep returning to the same tired tropes. Khan (Wrath of Khan), Soran (Generations), Ru'afo (Insurrection), Shinzon (Nemesis), Nero (Star Trek '09) and Khan (Into Darkness) are all damaged men concealing their identities who have been wronged in some way by the Federation or Kirk and are seeking revenge. It's a story that's been told so often in the Star Trek universe now that it's hard to remember films like The Motion Picture or The Voyage Home that HAD NO VILLAIN. Those films, while flawed in their own ways, at least made an attempt to dip into the rich history of science fiction storytelling and create something more than fistfights and laser battles. Into Darkness is such an un-science fiction film that you could easily take out the tech and change the costumes and make this into a Lethal Weapon movie.

The one bright light of the film is the ending, which suggested they might take subsequent films in a new direction, hopefully one that doesn't involve an evil maniacal super-villain.",1377993600,6,2209,4.835978835978836

Any true Star Trek fan knows that ""Captain Pike"" was confined to a futuristic wheelchair and eventually stayed behind on a planet where he was restored to his healthy self by aliens.  How does Abrams reconcile this obvious mistake?  Insofar as Khan is concerned, there is no evidence whatsoever in the original series episode involving Khan that he was in Star Fleet.  And if Kirk, et al met Khan during ""Into Darkness,"" then why wasn't he known to Kirk and the crew in the Star Trek original episode?

5294491,2,B009934S5M,"This review will contain some minor spoilers, you have been warned.

Despite doing a ""reboot"" with the 2009 film, to explain why Abrams could ignore 40+ years of Trek lore, JJ goes back to Trek lore for this movie.

The special effects are of course up to par with Hollywood big budget films.  If all you're looking for is eye candy, then you'll enjoy this film.  If you have only seen the 2009 movie, and no other Trek media, you will enjoy the movie.  However, if you are a Trekkie (or Trekker) you will be disappointed and possibly upset by how Abrams further butchers Trek lore.

The set up of the film is the Enterprise hiding under water while Spock goes into an active volcano.  There is then a big scene where Kirk has to violate the Prime Directive to save Spock by revealing the ship to the natives. WHY the Enterprise would submerge under water makes no sense.  They would be safe in orbit and could easily beam Spock out, yet JJ Abrams (who is doing his thing and to heck with the lore), creates this absurd situation just so Kirk can get demoted (briefly) later in the film.  You could delete this entire scene and it would not affect the story at all.

Plus Kirk is further portrayed as a reckless, rule-breaking, bad boy contradictory to the character we've seen since the Original Series.  I cannot fault Chris Pine as he does a good job given the script.  However, before this film the number of times Kirk broke the rules could be counted on one hand.  Here, JJ Abrams has a Kirk that makes one wonder why Starfleet would have him in the first place let alone captain of the Enterprise.

The rest of the movie is basically Star Trek II, with some tweaks.  JJ Abrams continuing his trend of his films taking cues from other movies.  The ending is actually a blantant copy of the ending to Star Trek II.

Overall the individual actors play their parts well with Benedict Cumberbatch pretty much stealing every scene he's in.  This movie is forgettable, some will watch it for the CG then forget about it later, others will watch it for a specific actor (Cumberbatch or Pine) and that's about it.  It has no redeeming qualities as a Trek film, made by people who either (1) don't care about Trek lore or (2) aren't familiar with Trek lore.

The DVD/BluRay release is insulting. I pre-ordered the 3-disc 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital set trusting that the set would be as feature-packed as the previous film. The set contains:

* 42 minutes of ""making of"" features
* No trailers
* No commentary
* Nothing else you can think of

To be fair, Amazon also has the set with the phaser. Wal-Mart has the set with the Hot Wheels Vengeance. I'm fine with these little ""exclusive"" perks. But then:

* Best Buy/Cinema Now's exclusive set has 30 minutes of additional exclusive features
* Target's exclusive set has 30 minutes of additional exclusive features
* iTunes has an exclusive commentary by J.J. Abrams and company

That's right: There's a commentary by the director and *none* of the DVD/Blu-ray releases have it. This isn't a film where no commentary was recorded; they simply did not bother to release it outside of iTunes. While the discs come with a digital download code, that means that purchasers who want the commentary must (1) Make sure to redeem the iTunes code, *not* the Vudu edition, despite the fact that Vudu plays on more devices and (2) Are still limited to watching the commentary on their computers. Due to technical issues, the commentary is not viewable on iPads, iPhones, etc., to say nothing of watching it on your TV. To purchasers who did not realize this and redeemed the ""wrong"" one not knowing the special features would be different (or perhaps not even realizing the digital version *has* special features): Tough luck. Syncing your computer audio and your Blu-ray player isn't an option either because the commentary contains branching, although I doubt many would want to go this route anyway.

The Amazon sets are missing at least an hour of featurettes. (Note that Paramount is to blame for this, not Amazon.) Even the ""exclusive"" sets are still missing a minimum of 30 minutes. (To make it worse, the DVD-only release has *nothing* on it other than the film. Believe it or not, there are still a lot of fans without Blu-ray players who love features, but I accept that this is gradually changing, so I'm not knocking the rating for the DVD issue.) Missing features on the Amazon sets include:

* The Journey Continues... Again
* Rebuilding the Enterprise
* Full of Wrath
* Kirk & Spock
* Visual Preferences

This is not fair to the fans. I'm waiting for Paramount's ""ultimate release"" of the film, or at least one that has a commentary. I'll happily change this to a five-star review if they release a decent set.

5294509,4,B009934S5M,"SPOILERS AHOY. There's no point trying to review this movie without them.

So. Into Darkness sees the new Trek cast go up against a conspiracy within Starfleet; one that begins with a bombing on Earth and ends back in San Francisco, taking detours through the Klingon empire along the way. It's a big, ambitious film, with a clever, convoluted plot that is pleasantly cerebral. And as you almost certainly know, it features English rising star Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn. What he lacks in oiled, muscular chest real estate he makes up for in panache. Pine, Quinto and company are just as good as they were before, bringing their own twists to unmistakable classic characters. Peter Weller rounds out the cast as Admiral Marcus, who will surprise nobody when he turns out to be the bad guy, since he already was one on Enterprise.

The movie does a ton of stuff very right. In this universe Kahn and Kirk meet for the first time under different circumstances and their relationship is one of tense violence mixed with sympathetic understanding. Kirk initially pursues Kahn, who is responsible for a devastating attack on London, all the way to the Klingon homeworld in an epic shootout (the klingons are kind of a three-way hybrid between their TNG appearances, Middle Earth orcs, and glam rockers, and it totally works) but becomes sympathetic to Kahn's plight as a victim of Marcus' blackmail. Marcus has thawed Kahn (a long-frozen warlord from Earth's distant past, for those not in the know) to help instigate a preemptive war with the Klingons (and to win it with an experimental battleship, the Vengeance). Kahn allies with Kirk, but the Enterprise and its crew are really only pawns as he struggles to recover his frozen soldiers and declare war on the universe.

There's a ton of good stuff here. The interplay between everyone is great, the space battles are astounding, and Space seems more wild and wide-open than it did in the first reboot film. Yet the film is sloppy. The biggest problem is Kahn, who quite simply doesn't need to be Kahn. His identity is purely a shoutout to the popularity of Star Trek II; this Kahn is in no way dependent on the original, nor does he have a first meeting with Kirk for this film to spin off from. He could easily have been a totally original character. This fabricated twist that really only occurs in the minds of fans feels cheap, which is a shame because Cumberbatch is great. Conversely, Kirk and company all seem befuddled who Kahn is, when in the Trek universe casually meeting him would be kind of like walking into your favorite Starbucks to see Hitler as the barrista. So the people who SHOULD be excited about Kahn aren't, and the people who shouldn't be are expected to.

Trim aside the fluff and the JJ Abrams ego trip though, and this is a really good Trek film. It has the action and epic setpieces we expect of the films, but there are mysteries to solve and alien worlds to visit and it feels a bit more like an episode of the show. The Spock-Uhura dynamic, which was kind of lame in the last film, is now genuinely appealing, and everyone has settled into their roles- none so much as Chris Pine, who affects Shatner's frustrated leader exasperation with perfect pitch. And I'm reluctant to even harsh on Abrams too much- I was no fan of Lost, but his work seems to be increasing in quality at a geometric rate.

So buy this movie! Watch it, love it, and look past the hype to see talented actors bringing an exciting story to life. That is after all why we actually watch movies. And yeah, there is a Khaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan moment and yeah, it is actually pretty good. But I stand by my criticism.

PROS
-Well acted, great looking, good music. It's all pretty good.
-Feels a bit more star-trek-ey.

CONS
-BD is shaping up to be pretty bare-bones.
-BIG TWIST feels contrived and needless.
-Benedict Cumberbatch, talented as he is, lacks the rippling bronze physique of Ricardo Montalban.

NOTES
-In Space Seed, Kahn looks older than Kirk (because the actors are in fact 10 years apart). By that logic, he should now be even older since this Kirk is younger and Kahn has been thawed out for some time. Yet in this film their ages appear much closer (Cumberbatch is only 4 years older than Pine). That's some really nice cryogenic stasis, there.
-Throughout Wrath of Kahn, Shatner and Montalban were never actually in the same scene due to schedule and budget issues. In this film they share tons of set time, but are almost always divided in some way- by walkway levels in the fight with the Klingons, by force field on the Enterprise, by pylons on the Vengeance, and by paths through debris in the part where they, um, fly through debris. I have no idea if this is intentional but it is neat.",1377820800,2,4778,4.679761904761905

I really wanted this special edition, however I have just learned that this release will not contain all the extras that were prepared.  For some reason, Paramount decided to split the special features up and give some to other retailers.  In order to get them all, you need to buy 3 different sets of the Blu-ray.  In the end you'll have 3 copies of the Blu-ray and only then will you have the special features.  I have no problem with retail incentives.  That's why we have the phaser, or in the case of other retailers, models of the ships, etc.  The extra features, however, should be on all the DVDs.  The 'video' themselves should not be the extra features.  Nothing against Amazon - it's a great company, but i think with their buying power, they should have had all the features made put on the discs.",1377820800,157,886,4.453416149068323

Without him the movie is an enjoyable if forgettable distraction. With him it strives for something deeper and better. It doesn't get there, mainly because the script doesn't follow up on the intriguing moral dilemmas Cumberbatch's character represents. But every time he's on the screen you're compelled to watch him. He takes over the movie and leaves you breathless until the story veers away from him again. This is a MUST SEE if you are Benedict Cumberbatch fan.

You don't have to know a lot about the Star Trek story-line to follow the plot of this movie.  The story arcs were very simplistic and it could have been condensed into a single TV episode.  The characters weren't compelling enough for me to care about the action scenes, which were pretty predictable.  The only character arc I did find interesting was Spock's, while Kirk was just sort of pudge-ing around in cliche after cliche.  The way they dealt with the villain was pretty silly, and obviously full of logical errors in order to move to the next action scene.  I also thought the villain sounded less than sinister in his evil speech moments, which was humorous to me.

The personalities, the feel, and who the characters are in the original episodes bear no resemblance whatsoever to anything in this movie.

BestBuy has certain special features as does Target, Wal-mart, iTunes, Vudu, etc. Each of those retailers have ""exclusive"" content specific to their brand. The problem with their ""exclusive"" content is that it was produced for THIS blu-ray release. That's right! The extras produced for this blu-ray (yet, do not appear on it) have been given away as ""exclusives"" to retailers. And that's not the worst part. The biggest ""screw you"" from Paramount farming the extras? The commentary by director JJ Abrams and crew is only available as an iTunes extra. BE WARNED! If you buy this blu-ray/DVD, you will only get 40 minutes of EPK (electronic press kit) interviews and the film. That is all. To get all the extras intended for this release, you'd need to spend about $85.00 across several different retailers. That, people, is bull-plop.

Without giving any more away for those who haven't seen it yet, I will move on to say this.

I foresee that there will be more in this series and I hope the actors will stay with it to keep it running well. The actors can age in this quite nicely, as they will in real life, so there will be continuation. I just can't wait to see what comes next!!

I was a fan of the original Star Trek on TV and of all the movies. So it is great to now see new versions which capture the spirit of the old originals. Love Chris Pine as Kirk because he carries all of William Shatner's  old mannerisms, but also interjects new ones that make him special. The other actors have also made their own marks to compile a great new crew for Enterprise which can last for a long time. It's fun - and we all need some fun and escapism right now in our lives.

Make sure you spend a few extra dollars and get the HD version, if your device supports it (most do now). Plus, you get both versions anyway, when you purchase the HD.

5294563,3,B009934S5M,"""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a bunch of grand performances in search of an actual script.
That the plot has holes large enough to accommodate an exploding supernova should come as no surprise: the screenwriters, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof have a long history of substituting tropes, non sequiturs and jarring plot shifts, in place of coherence, character development and tight plotting.

This was tolerable in the first JJ Abrams 'Trek' film, because so much of it was fresh and interesting. However, ""...Into Darkness"" plays like a bunch of fanboys throwing their fave Trek scenes into a hat, pulling them out randomly, pasting them together and calling it a script.

We have 'Khan', the greatest Trek villain of them all...and, one of the greatest in SciFi history...or, do we? The role is miscast with the extraordinary actor Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's 'Sherlock'). Do I believe that he is brilliant...ruthless...superior? Absolutely. Do I believe him to be Khan Noonian Singh? Not for a moment...he is too elegant to be believed as the ultimate, genetically engineered warlord. What's worse, Khan's marvelous backstory is hardly mentioned...and, is only used as a plot device to give Leonard Nimoy an absolutely unnecessary cameo.

The laziness/sloppiness of the 'screenwriting'reaches its nadir, when the ""...enter the radiation-filled chamber/save the ship/die a hero's death/miraculously come back from the dead..."" routine from 'Wrath of Khan' is replayed...but, with Kirk and Spock switching roles. The shark has been well and truly jumped.

Finally, we have a lazily contrived series of events, starting with an Away Team adventure that seems more Bowery Boys, than Star Trek. These implausible blunders are supposed to make the audience believe that Kirk is a moronic, purile egotist...demanding to go on a black ops mission in order to avenge a death...AND, that the Admiral in charge of Star Fleet (a mis-used Peter Weller)would sanction it without a 2nd thought. Its hard enough to believe that Kirk would (even out of a need for revenge) risk his ship and crew this way. That the crew would blindly follow him on such an insane (asinine) mission is pure tripe. The movie reaches Ludicrous Speed, when we are asked to believe that a massive ship (and spacedock) could be constructed by this Admiral, without anyone at Star Fleet being the wiser. The theme of building tensions and political backroom skullduggery between the Klingons and Star Fleet, drove many excellent episodes of the Trek canon...and, would have made an interesting movie. So, also, would have a new approach to the Khan/Kirk dynamic.

Instead, the mashing of the two creates dual, under-developed plot lines that never mesh...and, its a pity, because the acting is simply superb.

The cast of this latest Star Trek incarnation lays full claim to their iconic roles in ""...Into Darkness"", with the exception the (normally) excellent Simon Pegg as 'Scotty'. His borderline goofiness of the first film has gone over to ham-fisted mugging...for which director Abrams must take a large part of the blame.

Zachery Quinto has taken Spock fully into the realm of having/acknowledging emotions. I don't cotton to this version of Mr. Spock...it eliminates the constant struggle with his dual nature; but, Quinto does such a superb job navigating the nuances, that you can't help but like the character. Chris Pine's interpretation of Captain Kirk is the highlight in this movie. Despite the contrivances that the script forces him into, Pine rises above it, and makes the role of Kirk his own. This IS a Captain that a crew would follow, fearlessly on a 5-year mission into Space. The scenes between Pine and Bruce Greenwood (Pike) are marvelous expressions of mentor/student, father/son dynamics...and, completely organic.

I was also very disappointed in Michael Giacchino's score. It is (literally) the same score from the previous Trek film, with the Romulan leitmotifs being recycled for Khan, and the Klingons (sounds like a garage band).

Bottom line: there is too much to like in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" to allow me to dismiss it out-of-hand. The cast is on-board, and ready for action...however, the director, screenwriters and composer are all on cruise control.

That's it...I'm off the bloody soapbox.",1377648000,12,4312,5.227206946454414

These movies have given me emotions I have never felt in the ""Original"" movies. That mixed with the ""Special Effects"" , superb acting and writing have made me an even bigger fan of the Star Trek Universe. The movie was over 2 hours long but it felt like half that and left me wanting more. There is not a character that I do not love just as much as in the original. The newer movies seem ""dark"" but seem to add just enough humor and emotion not to overwhelm you. I would recommend this movie to any that are ""on the fence"" about seeing it.

5294567,1,B009934S5M,"... but what JJ Abrams has done to Star Trek really makes that a moot question.  He's
turned it into a kids movie and removed the wonder and morality of Star Trek and
replaced it with soppy one-liners and computer graphics - some of which are pretty
cool but in a year or two will look boring, just like the original Star Trek's effects
look boring now.  The problem is with the old Star Trek there was something more
to the show that people still watch, but with the New Star Trek it will not be worth
watching because the whole venture is of cheap quality.

5294573,3,B009934S5M,"I know that many people will feel differently about this movie than I did, but the problem with the movie is more the direction and the fact that the movie seemed unfinished.  Kirk & the villain (spoilers....) were friends until the one man turns against him.  Star Trek II was a much better film but it was a continuation of the story from the TV show where you were introduced to who became the villain in that film.  It was actually a really good episode even when viewed today.  I didn't get much of a surprise with the twist in the middle and even some of the references that JJ tried to show us were understood but underdeveloped.  (Carol Marcus was a good example).

A few problems I had:

I did find it interesting that *no one* tried to stop a space ship flying into downtown San Francisco...
Carol Marcus?  Why add her when her contribution seemed like something Megan Fox could do.
The conflict and fight between the villain and Kirk was really short and really dull.  Watch Star Trek II to understand why it falls on its face (there was an edge-of-your-seat feeling when they were in the nebula -- not too much suspense here).

Still, compared to Star Trek 5 and Star Trek 3, it was a good movie.  I just felt like it was unfinished or rushed.  It could've been better.... much better.  But it wasn't nearly as bad as it could've been.

5294583,5,B009934S5M,"Since my early childhood, I've enjoyed Star Trek and though I thought the next generation and follow-on series were good, what I knew was lacking was the original characters (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Chekov, Sulu, Ohura..., but especially Kirk and Spock).
The initial movie  was a wonderful way to give rebirth to their story and such a creative way to set forth new paths for them all, but especially Kirk and Spock - with their friendship being at the center of their journey.
This new movie was full of awesome surprises that I didn't see coming, even though I'd seen all the trailers over the past year before it came out.  The week it came out, my wife and I went into LA to the best IMAX theater we could find to see it (the studio had just used that theater the night before for the folks who worked on the film to see their new masterpiece).  The IMAX version was so amazing, enabling you to actually feel like you're in space with them whenever a 'space' scene came on screen (the IMAX footage).  The story, the banter between Kirk, Spock, Uhura, and McCoy was priceless and funny - setting a wonderful context for the more serious plot that was unfolding.  Of course, the weaving in of 'Dr' Carol Marcus was great as well (obviously fortelling a new retelling of another part of Kirk's destiny).  These new writers and JJ Abrams clearly have such a wonderful appreciation for what were such important parts of the original series and movies - especially Star Trek 2.  Often missed by fans was the fact that the movies Star Trek 2, 3 and 4 were a trilogy - and its heartening to see that the new team is quite respectful of that original storyline and can make use of its greatness in this new creation.
I wholeheartedly recommend that everyone see this movie.  I do recommend you see the first one before it, if you haven't, because it provides important context to this one.
For those who really get into this movie who haven't seen them, I recommend you watch Star Treks 2, 3 and 4, since those were both the best of the original Star Trek movies, but also their storyline is relevant to the one retold in a new way in this new fantastic movie!

If you haven't seen this movie yet, just know there will be some great surprises!  Do not read too many reviews as some folks accidentally give them away and don't read the story synopses since they have started giving away some surprises.  Just sit back and enjoy the story unfold before your eyes!  Incredible special effects put you right into the story and the 'edge of your seat' action will not cease to amaze you and keep you guessing right to the end!

I admire the courage of the writers to develop a plot that dares to mimic any aspect of the original films and of an iconic character.  And for the most part, it worked!  Sure, Khan doesn't look like Khan.  As an aside, when new Spock contacted old Spock, I wonder how old Spock would've reacted if new Spock showed him a photo of new Khan.

We get a solid look at a Klingon world and what to (possibly) expect in the next installment. The performances were sound, though sometimes it really feels like the actors are ""playing"" their characters and not letting the essence of each personality come through naturally (except for Saldana who recreates Uhura perfectly).

5294597,5,B009934S5M,"I really have to admit that I hated J.J. Abrams' new take on the Star Trek franchise.  I couldn't stand the first film (and still can't), but this sequel is AMAZING.  Very well done, great storyline with edge-of-your-seat action, and great acting.

*SPOILERS AHEAD!*

Now to get to the nitty gritty stuff:

1)  The storyline:  KHAN.  I found it really funny how this is the second movie of the new Trek cast, and Khan just happened to be introduced here (just like the second movie of the original cast).  How they revealed the ""Federation agent"" to be Khan was pretty well done.  In this film, you have Spock screaming ""KHANNN!!!!"" instead of Kirk (which was rather blahh in my opinion), and you have Kirk (instead of Spock) being trapped in the radiation chamber.  What would have been great is if Kirk actually died in this film, but alas, he doesn't.

2) I felt that introducing the Klingons in this film was a wasted plot effort.  They really served no purpose here, and they looked AWFUL.  You can see the computer generated effects with the so-called makeup, and they look more reptilian than anything else (with parallels to the Cardassians).  Not a fan at all with how the new Klingons look.

3)  Capt. Christopher's Pike death.  Too bad they killed him off.  I wish they would have paralleled the Chris Pike character from the original series by showing how he came to be in a motorized wheelchair.

Other than the above points, I really enjoyed the film, and I'll definitely watch it again and again.  As much as I initially hated J.J. Abrams' re-imagining of the franchise, it's not bad when you view it in a certain way.  You can't see these movies as a complete destruction of the Trek canon or a cheap rip off.  You need to see them as an alternative history/timeline sort of thing.  When seen in this way (whether this is actually Abrams' philosophy or not), you gain a greater appreciation for these films.",1377475200,3,1923,4.621301775147929

It was just like watching another spock type character instead of someone macho. Second of all, what is with them all crying all the time? Really? What a bunch of cry babies. The switch of roles between spock and kirk was ridiculous. Nothing about the character development this time rang true. It was so tiring to watch. I had to put it on pause and go back to it later. The switching of roles was just to much and making everybody a crybaby was really sad.

The reason is I didn't feel the same tension between them nor does Khan's group of engineered superhumans play as key a factor.  That said it is still a very entertaining movie so I only subtracted one star.  If you enjoyed the first of the new Star Trek movies, you will probably enjoy this one as well.  All the key characters are back and for the most part doing what you'd expect.  Two exceptions, one is some explanation on some things that puzzled us in the TV series (Section 31, etc.), and Scotty gets in a snoot over weapons he doesn't have the specs on being brought aboard the Enterprise.  So much so he leaves, but don't count him out.  You know Scotty, he works miracles.  Well worth a rental.  I bought the Amazon Instant version so I could see it before the DVD release.

5294606,5,B009934S5M,"This is my 2nd review of a movie on Amazon.  I must admit, I did order (and still have on order) the 3D DVD.  But when I saw this was available on instant video on Amazon, well I ordered that one too!  HAHA!  Here is my review!

1) Plot:  The plot was excellent and it wasn't too obvious.  The bad guy's name remained nameless to me until just before he identified himself. It wasn't so soon as to make the movie any less exciting than it was.  The plot did take a dangerous theme from Trek history, one that for us Trek followers could have been disastrous if not done perfectly. Some Trek followers might even consider it movie blasphemy.  I admit, there were a few seconds that I thought they had crossed the line.  But it wasn't a few more seconds later where a tear welled up in my eye and was proof to me that it was done well.  Yes, they did it right.  I'm sure the director, JJ Abrams, was sweating bullets the whole time.

2) Action:  All Sci-Fi movies should have a lot of action and Star Trek is no exception.  This movie had all of that, and it did keep me guessing about what was next.  There is no shortage of action in this movie, None.  And the special effects supported the action 120%.  From the Enterprise, shuttles, volcanoes, alien worlds, to things that go boom, smash and crash.  Its an eye popping, ear ringing, action adventure movie that just so happens to be in the future.

3) Acting.  I rather like that the actor Zachary Quinto that plays Spock gained some weight from the last star trek movie.  My guess would be about 15lbs.  He wears it well, and acted true, albeit slightly out of bounds, from his historical character. But, I suppose that was the point anyways since the last movie changed history right?  Chris Pine, who played James Tiberius Kirk (every time I think of his full name I think of the first movie where the 9 year old version says it - high pitched!) did an excellent job again.  The not-so-confident Kirk is humbled to death in this one and that too is a turn from the historical version.  Everyone else was excellent too.  However, I did think the Tribble was a little out of uniform.  Since when was there ever a  short hair version? - Ok wait, I have the answer.  Since history itself changed.  Ok ok.

So, if you are a follower of Trek, you will not be disappointed.  If this is the first time seeing a trek movie, you'll be better than fine, as long as you like Sci Fi, action and good vs evil.

Have fun!  I did.",1377388800,3,2470,4.2841648590021695

One example of reaching beyond the stars is where Mr. Abrams shows his love for classic westerns in the fight on top of the boxcars of a moving train. Hold on, I'm sorry, they were fighting on spacecraft and Spock lost his six gun, oops, phaser.

5294614,2,B009934S5M,"I was fooled by a trailer emphasizing the imaginative first half of the movie, with new lifeforms, cool scenery, and a villain who seems to have mixed good and evil motives.  But the writers couldn't seem to figure where to go with it, so they went into ever more unbelievable zipping through fields of debris and narrow escapes, giving the same unimaginative end to Khan for the 3rd time, and relying on the same tired ""I have to go into the reactor to save everyone"" theme with some hand-waving revival.

All of the wonder of encountering new and different lifeforms, higher or lower, who might behave in unexpected ways is lost from the Start Trek franchise.  There is also a pointed hopelessness that has crept in about the future of man, as it supposes there is no peace to be made with any advanced human type and all are to be destroyed.

Most of the glowing reviews are probably written by people who did not see the original series in the context of the 1960s, who don't realize that we were in fact locked in a death battle with the Klingon-like Soviet Empire, and that Star Trek of that era prophesied a hopeful end to the madness of mutual destruction - an alternate ending that 20 years later played out in the real world.

Hopefully this version of Trek is not as prophetic.  It makes clear that we are our own worst enemy as [warning, spoiler] Kirk faces off against the evil admiral.  After that the plot goes down a rathole.  I gave it a couple of stars for the nice red jungle at the beginning and the questions it raises about our security apparatus.

5294620,4,B009934S5M,"""I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I only know what I can do.""

I went to see the new Star Trek movie, in 3D. It was very good. If I was rating for Netflix, it would get a 4 out of a 5 star rating. It's actually 4 1/2 but it's not a 5, so you rate it as you can. Very good but not GREAT. Since I won't give spoilers, I have to say there was one scene, very emotional, that would have sold it for me. There was some foreshadowing but not clumsy and neon appointed ""hey this is what's gonna happen."" I was so into it that I didn't read the solution right away, but still figured it out before everyone in the movie did.

The 'bad guy' is a very bad guy, and I enjoyed that kind of clarity because it's not always that clear in life. I get a queasy /creepy feeling when I spot a shoplifter at work. I know it even when they act friendly toward me. It's the same feeling I get every time a politician appears on TV. That's both parties, you are fooling yourself if you really believe that Your party is better. It's the power thing. I see people gravitate toward power and criminals as though it would make them powerful by osmosis. I wrote about the TV show Hannibal, a while back, and how it was tempting to sympathize with the evil title character. This the same kind of reach; people who feel powerless in their lives sometimes accept bad and even evil in order to try to overcome what they think they lack.

At work one night, one of my co-workers had denied a sale of alcohol to a man because he appeared to have been drinking. He got belligerent and, by the time I got there, his actions left me no choice but to ask him to leave. He then tried going into the main part of the store but I stood in front of him and told him that he had been asked to leave. He was insistent, I remained firm in my resolve and this standoff went on for about a minute. At that point, a member of a large biker gang came over, and told the guy I had asked him to leave. He then grabbed him by the shirt and threw him through the door. Drunky was in over his head, and all I could picture was him getting the beating of his life, or worse, and me having to spend the rest of the night talking to the police.

I got between Drunky and the Biker and told Biker that I had it covered and to go ahead and take off before the cops came. Drunky was on the phone at that moment calling the police. Biker kept moving toward Drunky, but I stayed between them, calming Biker down, thanking him and assuring him that I would take care of the situation. Biker and his friends left. The police came about a minute later but Drunky proceeded to irritate the cops enough that they ended up taking him in and never asked me what had happened.

Later, one of my co-workers commented how it was cool that the Biker had helped and I said, No, it wasn't. It's easy to appreciate a wrong thing done that helps you out but it doesn't change the nature of the action. It's still a wrong thing. That's true without going ""worst case scenarios"" where it easily could have turned on me for getting in the middle. That's the nature of bad and evil. You'll accept it as long as it's not directed at you. Whether it's a pork laden bill passed by Congress, or a crappy law that helps you or your family out at the expense of others...or just a pissed off Biker looking for a fight. Wrong is still wrong.

In the movie, there were bad things done, and other worse things to be done because one person was justifying his actions by going ""worst case scenario."" This (bad action) will prevent even more awful things. I know, confusing, but that's what happens when you try to let ""a little bad"" or evil in. You start to think a little bad won't hurt....much.

The line that stuck with me was from Kirk saying the line at the top of this post. If I ever told you that I had a plan for the most stressful times and incidents that have happened to me, you should feel free to call me a liar. Instinct, experience, and knowledge each play a part. Prayer plays the biggest roll and I wonder why I haven't proclaimed it more. Sometimes the world and life seem overwhelming and about to conquer everything around. I look up, and around and now I will say:

""I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I only know what I can do."" I'll pray and then move forward. I know that Good is better to follow, and will win in the end. I will also remember to say Thank you God! And remind myself that I probably should have said that first.",1377388800,,4472,4.120412844036697

5294628,1,B009934S5M,"How can you take probably the greatest tv show ever made (the show that died and went to heaven - in reruns) and screw it up.  I mean you are given everything. The people, the ship, the universe, the aliens, the time ---- everthing except originality.

Anybody who knows anything about anything knows that Kirk, Spock, and The Enterprise found ""The S.S. Botany Bay"" in space in the year 2196 (before the Kirk in the movie is even born).  How do you explain that?

""The S.S.Botany Bay"" was a ""sleeper ship"" (a ship that carried people in suspended animation indefinitely).  Khan (Khan Noonian Singh) was the leader of a group of geneticallly selected ""supermen"" that had survived the Eugenics Wars of the 1990s.  He had ruled a fourth of the earth but was forced to escape into space in the ""Botany Bay"".

After Kirk and Spock have their little episode with Khan and his 80 (not 72) survivors, Khan, the 80 survivors, and Lieutenant Maria McGivers, a historian on the Enterprise, are banished to Ceti Alpha V where they are just able to exist.

Now, enter this movie.  Dah. The movie in no way resembles anything about the original story.  Plus, Khan isn't white, he's golden skinned.

There are many other irritating points about the movie that make you wonder if these people who created the movie are taking too many drugs.

Spock never had a romance with Uhura.  Vulcans only mate every 7 years at the time of ""pon far"".  Inbetween that time, they have absolutely no interest in women at all.

Also, did I actually see a tribble?  Wow!  They didn't encounter them until they went to space station K-7 to protect the quadrotriticate grain stored there from Klingons.  That's where we are intoduced to Mudd and his tribbles.  This all happens on the 5 year mission which they don't start on until the end of the movie.

You can go on and on, but I think you get the idea.  Klingons that don't look like Klingons and so on.

There are a plethora of movies being created by Hollywood nowdays that seem to treat the audiences like complete fools.  Robin Hood, The Three Musketeers and so on.

What Hollywood needs is some new good writers that can write good original stories and put them on the screen.",1377302400,13,2201,4.584615384615384

In hindsight, I can recall every gripping detail of how myself, and my daughter reacted when watching this movie together... I mentioned ""pillow"" in #3 because you will find yourself grabbing and wrenching on the closest pillow while the action scenes bring you so close to the fight, you'll find it almost impossible NOT to react with flinching, twisting, turning and a whole bunch of ""OHHHHHHH MY GOOOODDD!

5294630,4,B009934S5M,"As a fan of the original Star Trek series with L. Nimoy and W. Shatner, I was hardly entertained at the thought of being subjected to yet again a new spin on an old series which seems to be the in thing theses days.  It isn't often (in my opinion) that you can out do the old classics so although I had watched the 2009 Star Trek when it came to television (which was enjoyable enough) when my sci fi mad child asked me to take her to see Into Darkness I really didn't feel compelled to want to sit through 2hrs and 12 mins of the sequel.  That being said I took her and I have to say I was thoroughly entertained, for 3/4 s of the movie I was on the edge of my seat.  So much did I enjoy it that three days later we went back to watch the 3D version, which I would highly recommend given the special effects.  The beginning of the movie was visually stunning, the location of the Enterprise was a little odd, but hey let's not get too picky.  All the characters were believable, doing justice to the original cast and I loved seeing Nimoy back in his role of Spock even if it was for just a few fleeting moments, it was cleverly woven into the storyline.  The storyline itself was a little predictable in parts and sometimes a little unbelievable, lets face it jumping from one moving aircraft to another at high speeds is questionable, be it in outer space or within the earths atmosphere (in space they at least had a suit, so why not put Spock in some form of wing suit for the last few scenes fighting with khan to add that little bit more realism) and it is for that reason alone I took off a star.  Overall, I really really enjoyed this movie and will admit to being glued to my seat for almost all of it.  It is so action packed that taking a toilet break during the movie would be sinful.  We will be getting the DVD, and no doubt we will sit down again with my soft drink and nibbles for round three of the movie.",1377302400,2,1923,4.1066666666666665

1.  The naysayers, the people who dislike this movie because it is based on an old story.  Or perhaps the ones who are upset because its not a 70 year old, overweight William Shatner in a starfleet uniform.  Don't listen to them.  There will always be people who have a reason to dislike something, and just because they say something sucks, doesn't mean they are right.  Some people just don't take to change well, and its a shame.

2.  The movies of yesteryear are timepieces for sure, as I am sure this will be at a later date.  The story was good, plot-holes and all.  If you want a story without plot-holes, something that doesn't make you think, then go ahead and write your fan fiction.  Otherwise, keep it to yourself.

It came from the original actors playing the same characters not for years together but decades.  The movie is fun, nice to look at, and will get that little kid Star Trek excitement revved up. Remember that it is not ""The Space Seed"" or ""Star Trek II"", and enjoy it for the space adventure summer sci-fi movies feel. Just don't pick at the story because that would be a  disservice to a storied franchise that was resurrected by some really talented actors.",1377216000,,891,4.527950310559007

This time around we wonder if we'll be seeing Khan again. Well, I wonder anyway.",1377216000,,309,4.7407407407407405
5294663,5,B009934S5M,"Star Trek: Into Darkness is one of the best films of the Star Trek series of movies.  To my mind, the only two films that surpass it are Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek: First Contact.  The movie is very solid on story, characterization, and special effect laden action sequences that never overshadow the story or the characters.

There are two main things that have made Star Trek an iconic epic over the years.  The first is Gene Roddenberry's vision of a hope for a better tomorrow; that mankind is not only looking to explore strange new worlds, but to explore the unknown possibilities of existence.  Perhaps Q in the final episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" summed up Roddenberry's vision better than anyone when he states: ...""the exploration that awaits you is not mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknown possibilities of existence.""

The other main component is the relationship between three men that served to demonstrate an unconditional brotherly/comrade love between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.  In many ways, these three characters cover the spectrum of characteristics.  Spock, the ever-logical Vulcan constantly in pursuit of knowledge and logic and always seeming to criticize humans for their irrationality and ever-present emotions.  And yet, we have seen Spock behave almost emotionally when he has saved the lives of his friends countless times.  McCoy, the irascible ""country"" doctor who covers the opposite end of the spectrum from Spock as the one who yields more to emotional reactions.  But under McCoy's bickering and arguing is a powerful love that he as for both of his friends.  In the middle of that spectrum, we have Kirk, who is as prone to using logic and common sense as he is to using his gut-feeling and intuition.  And Kirk has an almost obsessive love for his shipmates, his ship, and his friends.

The film takes place very early on in Kirk's career.  In fact, he has yet to perform his legendary ""five year mission.""  So, one has to realize that Kirk is still a fledgling captain, regardless of how tactically brilliant he may be.  The same can be said of Spock who is still trying to control the emotions that always seem to be percolating just under the surface.  His relationship with Uhura is still alive and somewhat well.  The couple's relationship will be tested a bit during this film.  And McCoy is still the ever-complaining questioning doctor who seems to have a millions sayings ready to be unleashed at any given moment.  Because the characters are young and new, their relationship has not yet had enough time to gell into the iconic relationship that we know of these three men.  That being said, there is an emotional moment that takes place in the film that, unfortunately, isn't as powerful as it could have been because of the absence of the strength of that relationship.  I had almost hoped that such a moment might be savored for another movie later on when the viewer has a chance to become more emotionally invested with its characters and be able to feel more strongly what the characters are feeling.  On a more optimistic note as a result, a powerful bond and friendship will be solidified.

The story takes place when Starfleet utilizes a man who is renowned for his intelligence and tactical abilities.  However, the big prize of Starfleet inevitably turns upon his former masters, and Kirk and company are dispatched to deal with him.  Obviously things are not what they seem, and Kirk is pitted against all odds.  Anyone who is familiar with the story of Star Trek II will remember the famed Kobayashi Maru test (which was also utilized in the last film).  In many ways, this outing serves as Kirk's Kobayashi Maru...a veritable baptism by fire.  You might also notice some other parallel elements from that film as well, which I won't disclose here for those who haven't seen this film yet.

The cast of the film are as good as they were in the previous film.  Chris Pine is a fantastic Captain Kirk.  He's arrogant and cocky, and Pine has a real gift for comedic facial expressions and timing.  And we get to see Kirk begin to feel his affinity for his crew and his ship.

Zachary Quinto is playing Spock as well as he can.  I don't know if people understand how difficult a role this is.  Leonard Nimoy directed Robin Curtis (Lt. Saavik) in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.  He stated, ""to play a Vulcan you must have the look of a thousand years of wisdom in your eyes.""  It is not nearly as easy as it sounds.  But again, Spock is very young here in this entry.  In short, however, Leonard Nimoy really did make Spock nearly impossible for anyone else to play with as much complexity and depth that he did.

Benedict Cumberbatch is the surprise new character here.  He plays ""John Harrison"" with savagery and intelligence that really added some wonderful dimensions to the character.  ""Harrison"" is a man who is like a grandmaster chess player; someone who is always a number of moves ahead of everyone else, and it is fun to see if Kirk can find a way to outwit him.  I only wished that he had been given more screen time.  I really wanted to see a bit more exploration of this character.

I still think that of all of the characters to really ""nail"" the interpretations of their previous counterparts, Karl Urban's Dr. McCoy is still the best.  His speech pattern and mannerisms are all nearly dead-on.  He isn't in this film nearly as much as I would have liked, but every scene he is in is a welcome one.

J.J. Abrams has succeeded in breathing life back into a franchise that was all but dead.  This film is fun, exciting, and even thought-provoking when we consider the kind of people that we help to create.  If you enjoyed the last film, it is nearly a certainty that you will enjoy this one as much, if not more so.  And the fun part is, there is still plenty of ""Star Trek"" left to be told.",1377216000,3,5923,4.650625601539942
5294664,2,B009934S5M,"Ok, well went into watching this with much hope and after I read a few reviews and the story was about Khan's early existance and history I was excited. I enjoyed the first STAR TREK in 2009 reboot. Was very good actually. But, that being said I wanted so deep story lines and character development and It didn't develop.

 I knew about Khan from the first season of the original star trek in the 60's. I watched it and payed attention to detail and the things he said in that lone episode. I also watched Star Trek II: the wrath of Khan when it came out and is one of my all time favorites and also payed attention. I believe a story needs to coherent and connect. I was waiting the whole movie for a specific point where all two previous episodes connected and made the story and gave you a ""ah huh moment"" It never came and it left more questions then answers. Really made me ask what did I just watch? One trend I have noticed about films these days are the lack of story and meaty plots and all we get is CGI special effects. Well, it might fly with kids and teens, but people like myself that recognizes a good movie for having amazing story plots is what creates a great film.

  This filmed lacked real plot and depth of that plot to know your characters and get entangled in their emotions and history of who when where and why? Didn't have it. The overall plot of the film is simplistic and I get it, but it never covered the real nature of who Khan is and why he did what he did?

In the 60's TV episode, Kirk saved Khan and pulled him out of cryostasis and didn't know who he was? Then he defeated him at the end of the episode and banished him to Seti-Alpha 6 with his new babe Marla. This is where J.J. Abrams hopes you don't have a brain and never watched the original stuff. Then in Star Trek II Khan escapes seti-Alpha 6 and goes after Kirk, fine and great and a well scripted film. Star trek into Darkness left out key information about who Khan is and in the end of the film showed him going into cryostasis but no mention of the starship S.S. Botany Bay, which found him in the 60's TV episode. Kirk dies in the film and is revived by Khan's blood? That is kinda silly and the director tried to make strong correlation to the original movie in 1982 when Spock saved the Enterprise and avoided being blown up. You also meet Dr. Carol Marcus and very limited plot development there too. Overall, you'll enjoy it but it won't make sense. Unless J.J. Arbrams is leading us into another chapter of  Kirk and Khan showdown I'd be surprised. Ok movie, but lacking in so many areas. If your a kid and you never saw the original stuff...I'm sure you'll love it. But for old school movie goers who know good film. I don't buy it!!",1377216000,4,2740,4.237547892720307

Some things are going to happen that are very similar, I don't have an issue with this. Others complain that it is not Sci-fi enough. This is true, it is an action movie, definitely. BUT... so are most of the other Star Trek movies. The only hard sci-fi Star Trek was The Motion Picture and a majority of people hate that movie. That was hard sci-fi, people. Make up your minds. This is a good movie, it's not meant to replace the original movies, it exists alongside them. The originals are always there for you to go back and enjoy. I don't really want the same stories that I have already seen, I welcome the changes that are being made.

Star Trek itself, in the fan books and novels, progressed to a Universe where multiculturalism was a core story and women were more than girlfriends and boy-toys in revealing outfits.

It was a venue where we could question standard memes and imagine ways of solving problems other than wars.

5294679,3,B009934S5M,"Ricardo Montalban in the tv series & the movie is seared into my brain as the only Khan (Khan Noonien Singh).  So no mattered how talented Benedict Cumberbatch may be as an actor, he cannot ever be a suitable Khan.  Chris Pine as Kirk I can accept, Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy does an admirable job, as do the actors who play Scotty, Sulu, & Uhura.  Even Anton Yelchin as Chekov is pretty good.  But Zachary Quinto as Spock just doesn't pull off Spock in my humble opinion.  I have no tangible reason for my impression except that he seems TOO wooden - at least Nimoy used his eyebrows, squinty eyes, & raised voice as his human half inadvertently reared its head on many occasions.

I have watched all the tv series (remembering making fun of the gorn & lightweight rocks) more than once, all the movies, & the ensuing Next Generation, Voyager, Deep Space Nine, (never got that into Bakula's Enterprise though), so this may account for some of my bias.

The movie was better than most of the old Star Trek movies, however.  The one with the whales was so tedious.  When these old movies first came out, most of the high ratings were due to the original cast performing again rather than a true critique of the movie content.",1377129600,2,1221,4.463963963963964

And, I loved the first movie with this cast. Loved it. However, this one? Not so much. Forced action scenes... forced (not natural) interaction among the characters... and the biggest problem is a plot/storyline that is simply too much to take. Recycled is the only way I know to put it. Relying too much on past episodes. In my opinion it is just not necessary. It's one thing to pay homage to the original, but this is just uncomfortable.

5294687,5,B009934S5M,"To clarify, all articles published to date claim that the single disc DVD only edition contains no special features. The Blu-Ray and DVD as well as the 3-D Blu-Ray and DVD combo packs will contain featurettes but, from what I have read, they will be on the Blu-Ray disc and the DVD disc will be the same single disc in the DVD only pack (with no features). The Blu-Ray features, as noted in press releases, are listed as:

""Creating the Red Planet"" -- A featurette about the creation of the ""red"" planet so, basically, a special effects featurette.

""Attack on Starfleet"" -- The effects and filming of the attack on Starfleet Headquarters.

""The Klingon Home World"" -- Kronos featurette.

""The Enemy of My Enemy"" -- Spoiler alert, it's about the bad guy.

""Ship to Ship"" -- The space-suits only flight/jump of you know who and Kirk.

""Brawl by the Bay"" -- The brawl, by the bay, Spock and you know who.

""Continuing the Mission"" -- On the continuation, the sequel, the story after the first trek, probably similar to the first featurette on the Star Trek two disc dvd set from 2009.

It is a shame but there does not, as of yet, appear to be a two disc DVD only edition for people who don't see well enough to bother with Blu-Ray or people, like me, who think film is far more, and please pardon the use of such a stupid word, magical when it is ever so slightly fuzzy and you can't actually see the pores on men's noses.

I can only wish they'd start a series with the same people which I believe they could do excellent job with that and still once in a while do another movie. But since the time shift with the previous movie they could take a newer series just about into any direction. It's nice to see that the star Trek could keep going. As it is with the newer actors they have a great mesh together and appear to work well in their characters so why not make a series.

I really would like to see this come out as a series again. It's been long enough for us fans that a star trek series hasn't been done in quite a while. Plus hopefully which ever network were to do it isn't stupid like the previous ones at CBS and not schedule it on a Friday Night when they'd get less viewers. Put is up on like a Thursday or Wednesday when they'd get more people to watch it. Plus even if they weren't able to do that and had it on a Friday today there's DVR's and amazon where people could buy their episodes they'd for sure get the ratings and the sales from advertisers to more than pay for it. There's too many of us star trek fans out there to just forget us. After all look at the history of it even newer generations are watching. Hopefully someone in Hollywood is listening or maybe an advertisers that would love to sponsor such a new series. They should at least give it a try. After all the older original series only lasted 3 seasons only because the final season they moved it to Friday. Now days the day of the week doesn't really matter with DVRS and DVD recorders and amazon instant videos. Anymore these days I my new stuff there less chance of my movie getting damaged or lost or stolen.

I rate the film 3 stars because it was mostly a fleeting and filler written film, in my opinion. The previous (reboot-franchised) film had the character development, INTO DARKNESS had more character development without the elongated, integrated plots. The main plots are lackluster. The acting is excellent, so believable that in moments, I felt as though I was in the film, in space, however, the writing and direction is too surface. The previous film is one that is a must-see. INTO DARKNESS begins with the crew running, the film ""hits the ground running"" and that is a great idea for a a film with 1 premise, however, this film has so many side-plots being played out, none of the plots are given proper time to play out.

Star Trek INTO DARKNESS could have been epic, I had great expectations with no spoilers when I watched this film. I wasn't the only person whom thought the film was lackluster & fleeting, the family watched all at once and agreed after that this film is too flawed in production. With actors at pinnacles of their craft, the writing, direction and even the graphic effects were less than stellar.

Into Darkness has the makings of a curvy, complicated red tape thriller, but its predictability, superficiality and outright refusal to go more than five minutes between jump-cut-loaded action scenes halts the germination of that seed relatively early. With the exception of big-bad Benedict Cumberbatch, who manages to be both admirable and despicable in even doses, the film is thoroughly overacted and the touches of fan service that I so relished in the 2009 reboot seem far more forced and unnecessary the second time around. There's also a notable lack of gravitas to the proceedings, in my opinion one of the hallmarks of the series, with an unfamiliar trigger-happy temperament lending the impression of an adult who's regressed into a period of renewed adolescence. That's not to say it isn't enjoyable: the action sets, though frequent, are constantly fresh and exciting, while its daring in even-handedly tackling the subject of a 23rd century terrorist is progressive and topical.

5294699,2,B009934S5M,"Okay, I'm going to be straight about what I think of Star Trek Into Darkness, and if people don't like what I have to say that's fine, but don't start leaving personal attacks and insults in the comments.  For one thing, I loathe people who do that kind of thing; for another, it's just plain childish.

Having said that, here goes:

On one level (as one of the old-guard Trek fans), I despised what was done with this movie.  It started off with a major (and I do mean MAJOR) violation of the Prime Directive that left a primitive species with knowledge that could potentially alter the course of their history and cost Kirk his command (for the moment; Kirk is back on the bridge of the Enterprise within minutes), he turned Khan (quite arguably the movie's worst kept secret; practically everyone I talked to knew that ""John Harrison"" was really Khan from the get-go) into a skinny, white British bloke (not that I'm knocking Benedict Cumberbatch; I happen to be a huge fan of his); and he had Chekov working in Engineering for half the movie.  Add to that Spock's street brawl with Khan, a scene where Carol Marcus rather unnecessarily strips down to her bra and panties, and an Engineering section that looks suspiciously like the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Van Nuys that they filmed it in, and this film makes Ed Wood look like James Cameron.

To be fair, I can't blame the cast for this film; all the actors are very good, but they were working with a bad script that seemed more concerned with cannibalizing lines and what appeared to be entire plot points from The Wrath of Khan than turning out something with a lot more substance and heft to it.

As someone who just plain enjoys a good old popcorn film every now and again, Star Trek Into Darkness was okay, which is why I gave it the rating that I did.  The plot might be chock full of references to the original show and sacrifices of a good script for lots of visual effects and at least one gratuitous scene with Kirk in bed with a couple of ladies (plus the aforementioned, equally gratuitous scene with Carol Marcus in her bra and panties), but it had lots of action and great visual effects (an area where JJ Abrams excels, sometimes at the expense of a good story). If only this film had actually shown that those in charge had actually cared about what they were doing, then it might have been a decent Star Trek film; as it was, it made for an okay popcorn film, and some might even question that, considering that the Enterprise should have been in orbit instead of submerged in a body of water in the opening scene. After all that, I cannot totally condemn this movie, but neither can I wholeheartedly recommend it.",1376956800,10,2688,4.516460905349795
5294700,5,B009934S5M,"I read another review where someone says ""Abrams takes a burned out franchise and renews it"" I couldn't agree more. I am a DIE HARD trek fan. Been watching since i was 5 years old, which was right about the time the series ended. I have watched every Movie, spin off, and now yet another adaptation of my beloved show, only to see i was ecstatic at the portrayal of things, with some gripes (mostly minor) that exist solely because i try not to be a purist, but as a sci fi fan you just cannot help it sometimes.

The action, the re telling of the story, and Cumberbatchs' homage to the timeless Montalban villain, left you really appreciating the herculean task that Abrams took on, and that, given what, when, and where he had to work it, he did a great job. I look forward to more films, but will be hesitant, since hollywoods endless need for money ruins even the mighty phoenix's ability to rise from the ashes.

One can debate that Pine or Quinto didn't deliver this, or that, as you can pick apart anything, but as much as i did not want to like Quinto as Spock, i found myself warming to this re imagined version of him as somehow (i know its blasphemy) more human. In the end, if you ever liked anything Star Trek, you MUST see this and decide for yourself, or if you don't know Star Trek (like lived in a cave), this would be a welcome place to drop in after you see the first Abrams movie.",1376956800,5,1400,4.2593984962406015

5294702,5,B009934S5M,"So... LOTS and lots of people are infuriated by this and the 2009 Star Trek movies. I have no idea why. I have no idea what they were expecting from a modernized reboot of the classic TV series. People are calling it boring, sad, hopeless, sappy, confusing, tiresome, shameful etc. etc.

Have they seen the original series?!?! If so, go back and watch them season by season, episode by episode, and you will see nothing but boring, sad, hopeless, sappy, confusing, and tiresome! The original series was great, don't get me wrong, however time has not been kind to the classic ST series. Gaudy makeup, horrendous costumes and set designs, awkward dated dialogue, poor plots, etc.

I for one am blown away by JJ Abrams' AMAZING Star Trek movies. Not just at the modern take on the classic, but on the OBVIOUS attention to detail in casting and set design, etc. This series WILL hold up over time. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but calm the heck down! It's just a movie!

And to those who say ""I cant get over all the plot holes""... It's an action sci-fi movie, just go with it, be entertained by it, and GET OVER IT. There are FAR worse movies out there including and not limited to Transformers, GI Joe, Avatar, the list goes on. THESE movies are made for young kids who don't care about quality.

There are things I would have liked JJ to do (and not do) in this film, however HE is the artist. He wrote produced and directed this film and it would be extremely narcissistic of me or anyone else to discredit, scoff, scold, or shun his efforts and/or his work of art. I highly doubt anyone giving this film 1-3 stars and talking badly about this film would do it 1/12th as good.",1376956800,2,1685,4.425806451612903

I also took issue with Kirk going from Cadet to Captain but I digress.

The point is that the broke the cannon and made room for all new Star Trek stories.  They instead chose to rehash the Khan Story and did a rather poor job of it.  I though the movie had good action in it, but the refrences to the original Wrath of Khan felt cheap.  If you are going to reboot, then reboot and come up with new material, don't try to shoe horn the existing cannon into the new format which Abrams seems to be trying to do here.

Upon watching the 2nd of J.J.'s movies (and saw it twice, because my daughter wanted to see it again), I am much disturbed by the direction this series is going. First of all, I agree with one reviewer that J.J. seems to be dumping everything Gene Roddenberry built. Secondly, are we to believe that an organization like Star Fleet, which is responsible for the safety of hundreds of planets, has such shoddy discipline on the bridge of a starship that the only way they can get things done is to shout at each at the top of the their lungs, and punch each other out? No just once, but multiple times? Like a bunch of school kids fighting to be king of the mountain? And this is supposed to be a responsible redirection of Star Trek? Well, it seems this once great franchise is going in the same direction as our society: morally bankrupt, senseless violence, with no standard of ethics (the idea that the only one who is right is ""myself""; tough if you don't like it).

It features a return of Khan, and I can't help compare it to the old ""Wrath of Khan"" Star Trek movie. That felt a little more horror, but this was more in line with Star Wars than anything Star Trek has done previously, but in the long running franchise, I think that was definitely a good direction for them to head towards.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The engine room in this edition of Star Trek was phenomenal. It was shot on location at the Livermore National Laboratory in a department called NIF (National Ignition Facility).

Since I don't have any recollection of the original cast members, I'm not all caught up in how things ""should be"".

5294713,3,B009934S5M,"I've never considered myself a Trekkie.  In fact, I make fun of those people.  That doesn't erase the fact that I wore Vulcan ears to school for Kindergarten show-and-tell, referred to myself as Spock for at least a year or two and told everyone to ""live long and prosper"".  You see, I'm one of those old school `Star Trek' fans.  I haven't seen any of the spin off shows outside of `The Next Generation' and I don't know any of the names of the countless characters that float in and out of the `Star Trek' universe.  I know the original characters, the ones that started it all, and I have seen all of their movies (not all of their shows).  I may not have seen them since my childhood, but the memories are all there.  So, while I don't consider myself a Trekkie and while I shamelessly laugh at those who can speak Klingon and who can name all of the alien races and actually hold full conversations of which alien race they'd like to part of (yes, I know some people like this), I hold a very special place in my heart for Captain Kirk and Spock and the rest of the crew of the Starship Enterprise because they were such a special part of my childhood.

Back in 2009, J.J. Abrams unleashed a whole new look at these characters with his Blockbuster rebirth of the popular franchise.  I was wholly excited to see these characters brought back to life on the big screen for a new generation.  In a way, it felt like coming home.  Finally I could feel alright about letting this particular universe back into my life.

It felt acceptable.

For me, `Star Trek' was one of the highlights of 2009.  With a rich cast (that ensemble is phenomenal) and a beautifully fleshed out storyline that took the important facets of an `origin story' and allowed to be embellished with a backstory and history that felt fresh, exciting and new, `Star Trek' exceeded my expectations.  Yes, it betrays in a way the very fundamental core of what the `Star Trek' universe was based on, tonally at least, but it made it more human and thus more accessible to today's culture and society.

It made `Star Trek' cool again.

With `Star Trek Into Darkness', Abrams and company continue down their slope of huge action set pieces and compelling chemistry to create another Blockbuster film that draws in the audience and keeps us at the edge of our seat awaiting the next frame.  As far as stringing us along within the scope of the genre, this newfound exploitation of science fiction and action in a way that explodes from scene to scene, Abrams still nails it.  He brings so much to the table in terms of style and visual impact that it is hard to fault that aspect of the film.  He knows how to keep you watching and enjoying what you are watching.

Sadly, for me, `Star Trek Into Darkness' just doesn't live up to its predecessor, and when you factor in the obvious inspiration for the film (the legendary `Wrath of Kahn') you have even more to `nitpick' about.

The question then rises is; is it really nitpicking?

The sad thing about this new edition into the series is that it just doesn't have the same heart and soul that the first film did.  It lacks that passionate humanity that laced the original film (and `Wrath of Kahn' as well).  While the snappy dialog and the chemistry between the characters is still there (I still love this ensemble and find it borderline perfection), the backstory element that helped make the 2009 reboot so successful is lost here in favor of a sloppily structured story revolving around a familiar character (Kahn) and a not so familiar one (Marcus).  Now, one may say that the origin story is done and so they need to move on, but by keeping the development of Kahn and Marcus's backstory so skeletal it made their plight feel uneventful despite being rather `eventful'.  Worse than that, as the film tries to explain the backstory it so recklessly threw together, it becomes sadly obvious that little thought was given to plot development at all.  It makes little sense and feels only half developed.

I also found the shameless referencing to `Wrath of Kahn' without the same depth of character and circumstance to be disheartening.  The finale concerning Spock and Kirk in a very familiar scene (swapped roles, but mirror image) has a veneer of emotion and yet it all feels so manipulative because you already know how the film is going to rectify the situation, since no one has the balls anymore to give us a downtrodden and honest ending.  Sure, in the midst of the film's intense gravitational pull I wasn't truly concerned with my emotional detachment, but upon reflection it is obvious why I nearly shrugged when leaving the theater.  It was intense and visually impactful and yet emotionally flaccid.

This is a big rift in the film for me.  Despite containing crowd pleasing elements (those techs are undeniably outstanding) and some true depth of performance (Cumberbatch makes so much out of his generalized villainy), as a whole I just cannot love this movie.  I liked it and yet it is truly flawed in a way that took me by surprise considering the depth brought to the 2009 film.

I like to consider myself a core fan. I was a little girl watching the original series when it first aired on TV. I remember screaming and jumping on my father when the ""alligator man was going to eat the cap'n"" or words to that effect, I was only 7 at the time.
Even though I am a core fan I think all of this nonsense some of your display over a work of fiction is ridiculous. I hear the same nit picking about The Lord of the Rings series and The Hobbit.
Core fans are hungry to see their beloved franchise revived but absolutely do not want their beloved sci-fi universe destroyed. I think the alternate timeline Orci and Kurtzman came up with works for that reason. We have all of our characters, we have similar stories but due to changes, from Pike dying to Vulcan getting blown up to Romulus getting obliterated, all of these things gives the writers new directions to go (Although getting rid of Romulus in the very first movie seems a bit premature).

Did anyone catch the Mudd reference? The spaceship they took onto the Klingon planet they confiscated during the ""Mudd Incident"". I wonder if it was the one hauling women around for lonely miners or his having a planet filled with Commander Data like beings.
In any case, I loved the many surprise references to the old series, ""Nurse Chapel"" reference, calling Scotty a ""Miracle Worker"", Dr Marcus, the ""needs of the many"" line and of course, KHHHHHAAAAAAANNNNNN!

Just FYI, one of the funniest moments in the movie for me was when Uhura and Spock was fighting and they were on the Mudd vessel. Kirk asks them both, ""Is working together going to be a problem for you two?"" and Uhura quickly says, ""Nope, no problem"" and Spock gives this weird look and says, ""Uncertain"".

If you're a fan of Star Trek, the reveal of who Cumberbatch's character really is should come as NO SURPRISE AT ALL.  That was by no means a brilliant twist.  If they wanted a twist, they should have cast him as Harcourt Fenton Mudd!!!

The reveal was kind of a let down.

And he's Kahn.

As far as movies goes, I enjoyed it.  It was the perfect switch my brain off and just watch to be entertained movie, some are easily ignorable...for one if you care THAT much about the ethnicity of the main villain, you should probably stop hanging around Klan rallies.  Kahn is from the Indian sub-continent, how was that accurately portrayed by the very brilliant but very Mexican actor, Ricardo Montalbahn?  Anyone remember a Mr. John Wayne also portrayed a ""Kahn?""  So as far as race goes: suck it up buttercup.

The things I have issues with.

Spock, the half human half Vulcan is still quite emotional, honestly is he ever going to learn to control them?

There is a role reversal from the end from an earlier movie.  It is setup to parallel its ?predecessor? that for me, it really pulled me out of the movie.  It didn't have that deep emotional resonance of the original at all.  They could have done it better...plus see the last part about the Vulcan.

Kirk's ability to command is called into question, again.  Why'd they make him a captain anyway?

Honestly, he doesn't listen to his chief engineer about a very major potentially dangerous safety concern?

Those issues yanked me out of the movie mentally and yanking me out of a story is a big no-no in my book, so that is why I gave it a 3/5.  The movie is a lot of fun and I recommend that you see it and even buy it if you like it.  If you don't like it, don't buy it.

Secondly its sentimental feeling of family and hope of the crew generates a great feeling.

Into Darkness was illogical, brainless, boring, inconsequential, predictable, techno-babble crap. All the emotions were forced and failed to connect due to god-awful scripting and the worst soundtrack I've ever heard.

5294725,1,B009934S5M,"As a long-time ST fan, the original series in particular, I thought this movie was horrible. Rebooting for a new generation is not helpful when one avoids social commentary. Yes, there were 2 or 3 sentences alluding to the drone issue of our own time, but the rest of the movie was nothing more than an action thriller with bits plagiarized from the Wrath of Khan. Simply alluding to events from the old ST might stimulate a few smiles, but the social commentary that was left out in this case was the very foundation of Roddenberry's approach. That's why the social commentary was the very basis of the plots on many of the original episodes (as well as Next Generation episodes) and some of the movies. Many of them bothered certain politicians, corporations, and leaders of organized religion. ST IV is an example of this, and after it came out more people were aware that Humpback whales were in danger and this had a positive effect on treaties regarding that issue. Try removing the social commentary in many of those stories and you have no movie at all. Brushing that aside and using characters and events from the old movie as an excuse to display new special effects is not bringing Roddenberry's ""philosophy"" to younger viewers.",1375228800,18,1239,4.7407407407407405
5294726,5,B009934S5M,"1) Star Trek
2) (:
3) Awesome
4) Some say there's gaps in logic with the plot. How? Kirk found the Botany Bay in TOS which eventually led to The Wrath of Khan later in Kirk's life. In this movie, Admiral Markus found the Botany Bay. This is Kirk's first time meeting Khan in this alternate universe AND Khan is still the same as when Kirk first met him in the original timeline because THE TIMELINE CHANGED CENTURIES AFTER KHAN WAS FROZEN!
5) The reason Spock is veering away from logic is because his home is Earth, which in the original timeline it was with Vulcan (which is gone in the alternate timeline).
6) This movie wasn't created for old trek fans. It strayed from the original path for the new generation! A lot of people don't like the old Treks because it's boring to the new generation.  Out of all of the people I met in high school, zero of them like the old stuff. However, they do love J.J.'s action packed thriller in space! I believe his goal was to use modern technology in implement it in a way to make the movie more interactive with this new generation, which worked(:
7) So far out of all the people who've seen this movie, much fewer have hated on it than those who enjoyed it, and most of those who did hate it claim to be trekkies from an older generation and that J.J. has ruined the entire franchise. I'm a huge trek fan from the new generation (as I was born in the early '90s) myself. I've watched every episode of every series and have played many of the computer games that have been released. I love Star Trek. It inspires me to pursue a career in which I can hopefully assist in the trigger of manned space exploration. Out of all the people I've personally met, none have hated either of J.J.'s movies. So before you dismiss this movie because you've seen those few hate responses to the movie, give it a try, you won't be disappointed! As for me, I look forward to a third and a fourth and hopefully by the fifth, I've invented a way to utilize matter and antimatter and watch the movie in the comforts of a large space ship on the other side of the galaxy.",1375142400,6,2094,4.30126582278481
5294727,3,B009934S5M,"In general, I think this is an okay movie.  I 100% agree with all of the comments about it getting away from the main theme or purpose of Star Trek.  As a movie, without considering the purpose of Star Trek, its very action packed and getting moving on very quickly without time to really reflect upon what happened.  This all comes down to JJ Abrams style.  You can clearly see this in his other movies and TV shows; he is about action not reflection (the opposite of the original purpose of Star Trek).

As a director JJ Abrams is like someone that was told verbally what Star Trek was like, but had never seen the show and didn't bother to read the Wikipedia page before jumping right in and it is clear in the movie that it just doesn't really fit well into the Star Trek universe.

The acting is fine, but some things just don't make any sense.  Why would a star ship with transports, shuttles, the works, need to ""hide"" itself in an ocean so primitive natives cant see the ship?  Why not just stay in orbit...

Bottom line, it was okay.  It moved way too fast for my preference and I just couldn't get over some of the inconsistencies with other Star Trek films and shows.",1375142400,6,1178,4.337899543378995

This movie was simply a string of hokey one-liners and action shots. They made McCoy's character out to be some sort of angry idiot that can only speak one line at a time.

I won't go into details of why this movie sucked so bad, but if you want to know, simply look at the rest of the negative views. Star Trek by name only, that is where it started and where it ended...",1375142400,11,537,4.114285714285714

It has everything. Great story, great characters, great villians, great special FX, humor, comradarie, grief, loss and of course, the Enterprise. The only gripe I have is it became a little fatiguing as they continued to encounter even tougher challenges at each turn but it was very fun to watch them overcome. This new cast is the epitome of who these characters are. All of them are excellent choices (even though Bones is a little bit of a stretch). Lets hope it doesnt take 4 more years to put up another rip roaring adventure because I want to see more of these people playing these parts.

5294730,4,B009934S5M,"I enjoyed this movie greatly. A good movie is one you can watch and lose track of time. For example, I saw Life of Pi and kept wondering how much longer the movie will go on. This movie was entertaining enough that I never wondered how much longer it would be.

Yes, it departs a lot from the original Star Trek. And that is a very good thing. It is not as cheesy, but it still at times is. While the story is entertaining, the encounter with the Klingons was lame. It was clearly thrown in because somebody thought it had to have Klingons and had to see people speaking Klingon. Speaking of which, why is it only the Klingons have a unique language? The Klingon encounter was out of place.

The movie by its very nature is predictable. It cannot help it. Normally I hate predictable movies, such as Avatar. But because it is a remake and because it had Khan in it, we already know what was going to happen. This movie was predictable only because I knew the story of Khan.

My final gripe is the appearance by Leonard Nimoy in this movie. Give it up already. It is not Leonard's fault, it is the fault of the writers.

What I like about the story is how Kirk makes Spock realize there are some rules that you must break. It starts at the beginning when Spock does not break a rule and it gets Kirk in trouble. But as the story advances, Spock begins to understand. I like how the roles were reversed for Spock and Kirk in the original Star Trek 2 movie: Kirk takes the radiation poison instead of Spock and Spock yells ""KHANNNNNNNN!"" instead of Kirk. I like how the story behind Khan was modified to make much of the story unique.

I generally enjoyed this movie. It was worth seeing in the movie theater. I would give it a B+ rating.",1374969600,5,1735,4.277439024390244
5294731,5,B009934S5M,"I had a major argument with a fellow Trekkie about the merits of this film. He continued to argue that the movie was good until the end, in which case it was a cop out of something that had already been done before (those who have seen other Star Trek motion pictures know what I'm talking about. Being sensitive to spoilers) This was my argument:

Yes it does mirror some previously established Star Trek plots, but the twists that accompanied the mirages are COMPLETELY important to what makes this film unique. The changes that were made to story lines from the original series completely change the way that the characters react and open them up to future discoveries that could not have been made in the original series (I'm mostly referring to Spock's emotional availability)

Even in the tiniest details it connects to the original series, down to the Tribbles, making any Trekkie feel right at home for the majority of the movie. The film was filled with the sass, wit, and banter that the characters in this show are known for and keep the audience on their toes with the surprises built in.

Maybe one or two other times in my life have I wanted to stand up in the theater or my living room (or wherever I was watching whatever I was watching) and root for a character so badly. The line from the trailer sums it all up. ""Is there anything you would not do for your family?"" This movie shows exactly how much of a family they truly are and I could not have been happier with this film.

By the way I NEVER see a movie multiple times in theaters due to the obscene prices, but I was willing to go three times to see this film, if that tells you anything.",1374883200,128,1663,4.407166123778501

5294733,5,B009934S5M,"We are a Star Trek family. We truly enjoy all things Star Trek but when stories started to sway from the original theme probably really started with the series Star Trek: Enterprise. Stories of an alternate beginning with a ""time war"" and an attack on Earth that never happened prior in any Star Trek movie or series. Then when the new Star Trek movie came out and Romulans' get thrown back in time and obliterate the planet Vulcan, this totally changes the scope of stories to come. So this movie goes on from this ""alternate time line or reality; take your pick"". Yes this was a story done in the original Star Trek series and then in Star Trek: The wrath of Khan. But keeping that we've skewed from what was to what now is; this story does a great job of being told. And truly some terrific humor and character relationship building.

 In the original Star Trek, Kirk and Spock come to be brothers, always looking out for each other and this is carried on in this new movie even stronger. And when it comes to action, it may seem a little slow at times but when it does happen, you're not disappointed. The Dreadnaught class of ship was never built in the original series but in this departure from the old to the new, we get to finally see a Dreadnaught ( a British term for a super battleship prior to the outbreak of WWI ) built and in action, which could lend to even more exciting battles to come with the Klingon empire and the Federation in any future stories. This movie builds on the relationship that many old Star Trek fans kept saying existed between Spock and Uhura. Though it is about time they put seat belts on the ships of the federation, they need to put in the walls. Far too many people keep getting sucked out into space even in this movie. Crew safety was paramount in the concept of the series. But again, this movie delivers a good story and action.

We purchased this from our local Best Buy store 9/10/13 and have watched it half a dozen times so far! Though my Daughter and I did not like how Paramount started this new venture, it has gotten our family captivated. In the extra features though, this time the outtakes ( bloopers ) were not included! Total bummer because it is enjoyable to watch the cast members having fun even when they make mistakes. We wish they would include outtakes with every movie. These actors & actresses truly create an enjoyable movie experience! They do a fantastic job of bringing back Star Trek for the new generation and those of us who were used to the older Star Trek with Shatner & company, once we look past the what was, can enjoy this alternate universe of the Federation and a new spin on stories yet to unfold.

5294737,3,B009934S5M,"2009's Star Trek was one of those films that defied expectations. It was so good, so entertaining, so full of great character moments, that it was almost effortless in its ability to entertain. At the time, I stated that there was maybe one scene in which I would go out for popcorn. Unfortunately, this film has many such scenes. It's never a good sign for me when you come out of a film entertained on the surface level, yet most of what you remember about it is the things that you didn't like. Were there problems with the first 2009's Trek? You betcha! But its heart was in the right place and it learned to respect the Trek.
  The main thing that can be determined with a degree of certitude concerning this Star Trek film is that the film's director, J.J. Abrams is wholly capable to direct the next Star Wars film. There's so much wiz bang action and Stuff! Stuff!! Stuff!!! flying at you that during one point in the film, while two small ships were weaving through the buildings of a cityscape, my wife turned to me and said, ""No, that looks nothing at all like Star Wars.""
  And that may be this film's biggest problem. It's so action oriented, that this film series has veered away from anything that resembles what could be defined as Star Trek. It seems that in the effort to broaden the appeal of Star Trek, the studio and the film's creative team are content to transform Trek into something it never was and probably never meant to be. It is now a summer tent-pole actioner which is almost indistinguishable from the other types of science fiction adventure films out there.
  In the 23rd century...
  Some time has passed for our heroes. Since the end of the first film, the U.S.S. Enterprise has been on several adventures. And in the classic tradition of the opening teaser that was so prevalent in all the Star Trek television shows, this film opens right in the middle of one of these adventures. While on a mission to a strange new world, and assigned to seek out, but simply observe, new life and new civilizations (here in the form of a primitive culture), Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his Chief Medical Officer, and best friend, Doctor Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban) decided it would be more exciting to be seen by these primitive aliens and now are on the run from a group of them. At the same time Vulcan First Officer, and Kirk's other best friend, Spock (Zachary Quinto), is in the middle of a local active volcano in an effort to prevent it from erupting and destroying that very same primitive civilization.
  Unfortunately, in an effort to save Spock from the violent vulnerabilities of volcanic vaporization, Kirk allows the Enterprise to be seen by the primitive culture. Kirk is ordered back to Starfleet Headquarters, is promptly demoted and loses command of the Enterprise. Spock, for his part, thanks his captain with heartfelt admonishments of, ""You have violated the Prime Directive,"" while never having a true understanding of why Kirk had to save him. (For those not in the know, the Prime Directive is THE supreme law of the United Federation of Planets, and is basically a directive to not interfere in the natural developement of other cultures. [For those not in the know, the Federation is a collection of worlds that have come together to form a large democratic governmental body, living in peace and harmony, and is protected and explored by Starfleet. {For those not in the know, Starfleet is... Man! One could do this all day! }])
  Meanwhile, a bigger threat is looming as a currently disgruntled former Starfleet agent by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), has vowed to unleash terroristic revenge against the Federation and begins by bombing a records facility in London. Then, he boldly attacks Starfleet Command itself, before escaping into hiding on the Klingon homeworld Kronos.
  Kirk is quickly (and I mean quickly) given back his command and ordered by Admiral Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller) to take the Enterprise to the edge of Klingon space with seventy-two specialized photon torpedoes, with orders to launch them into Kronos and take out Harrison, even though it will certainly cause a war to erupt between the Federation and the Klingons. Now Kirk must wrestle with the dilemma of killing a Federation Citizen who hasn't even stood trial for his crimes as well as the uncomfortable rift between him and Spock.
  After the much and deservedly loved reboot of the Star Trek franchise in 2009, naturally there were going to be high expectations to come with this second adventure of our beloved crew. With that film, the filmmakers progressed through the lengthy introductions of the characters and their world, as well as creating a clean slate to create new stories without the cumbersome baggage of the forty-six years of lore that had come before.
  Here, J.J. Abrams again crafts a yet another breezy adventure that transports the viewer from on set piece to another. His hand is more assured and comfortable in navigating this new Trek world that he's established. Of note is an entertaining teaser and some genuinely awe inspiring moments involving the Starship Enterprise. He's come up with a more interesting villain than 2009's Romulan, Nero, as well as a palpable sense of unease as the Federation itself comes under threat. In short, we fly through the film and leave without the feeling that we've just sat through a two hour film, a tribute to the talent of Abrams.
  The film's cast also has an easier time with this outing. After 2009's Trek, having imparted the characters with their own personal stamps, the actors are now free to come out from under the very long shadows of the original cast and free to mold these people any way they like, limited only by the personality types that the characters are. In other words, the roots are the same, but the sprouting plants will differ.
  So, no longer is it Chris Pine's interpretation of William Shatner's James T. Kirk, It is now Chris Pine's Kirk. And with this new freedom, it's a very different Kirk indeed. Pine expands on the brashness that he established for the character, starting out as a Captain who has ""no humility"", ""doesn't respect the chair"", and is ""relying on blind luck"" for his success. Pine begins with that brashness, then capably bring his character to a more mature place as the seriousness of events start to pile on and he learns of the weight that command must place on him.
  Zachary Quinto's Spock is never better. He starts out as a person who is so clinging to logic and non-emotion that he really doesn't understand the depths of loyalty and friendship until the seriousness of events start to pile on and he learns of the weight that relationships with humans must place on him. But in the end, the question is, ""Is he choosing not to feel or hiding from his emotions."" The answer will surprise him (but probably not the audience). Quinto, as an actor has quickly mastered the ability to balance a performance of suppressing his emotions, yet infuses the character with a dry charm to keep his Spock an engaging and likable character.
  Of the rest of the cast, Zoe Saldena's Uhura, is again given the most to do and is allowed to share in the adventure in a way that Nichelle Nichol's Uhura from the original series would have dreamed for. But the truth of the matter is that Saldena has less of an opportunity to shine than in the previous film, and that may be in part to the lack of scenes in which she is allowed to be a real person, instead of someone participating in the action. Still she is just as confident and professional as she was in the first outing, but never more than that.
  And what can be said of Karl Urban's McCoy? McCoy used to be a vital part Star Trek, being the emotional voice, there to counterbalance Spock's logic and show Kirk the humanity of the situation, so that he can fulfill his role in what course of action must be taken. It was the Kirk, Spock, and McCoy triad and the heart of Classic Star Trek. Unfortunately here, he suffers the same fate as Uhura. And while Urban has definitely gotten his portrayal of McCoy down, he's more there to sound off with a sarcastic quip. ""Dammit, Jim! It's not Star Trek unless I can spout a McCoyism!"" This will be most jarring to long time Trek fans, but even if we take the film on its own, Urban has a character who's been given less to do.
  The chief problems of the film lie with its writing, or because of the film's preoccupation with action spectacle, the lack of it. The characters get lost because they are people in a film so overwhelmed with action that they aren't allowed to let the relationships to each other or their humanity shine through.
  Benedict Cumberbatch's villain, John Harrison, could have been a great one. From the moment he's onscreen, you are drawn in, compelled by the sheer strength of his catlike magnetism to watch his every move. Cumberbatch brings an elegantly graceful menace that contains a suppressed strength ready to lash out. And though the film attempts to bring a logical motivation to his actions, he's fleshed out as a character through people talking about him and the always obligatory monologue scene where he tells our heroes how the world ""done him wrong"", rather than spending time with him and letting him show us who he is. Cumberbatch creates a performance that owes much more to the actor than to the material he was given.
  The chief illustration of the film's writing problems, though, is found in the relationship between the two leads. Kirk and Spock (and should have been McCoy) are two people that are joined at the hip, in a bond of friendship so strong that they would die for each other. But in the first film, their relationship consisted of spending most of their time at odds with each other, and only beginning to form their friendship towards the end of the film. Most of Into Darkness is spent with them again at odds because Spock's by-the-book attitudes cannot enable him to understand why Kirk risked his life and career by breaking the Prime Directive in order to save Spock's life at the beginning of the film. As a result, their bonding as friends has taken place between the two films. So, when the big emotional payoff scenes hit, they ring hollow because the audience has not shared in that relationship.
  Other problems are that the film has many plot holes that go unanswered (hence being holes). One wonders about the logic in which Harrison has come about his wrath. One wonders about the few people who are able take so many questionable actions, that it begs the question, ""Are they working in a vacuum where higher authorities play no part?"" One wonders how these can occur without resulting in major investigations and our heroes questioning their very beliefs?
  By the end of the film, no one cares. We've been given a breezy, yet almost hollow, two plus hours of entertainment, with lots and lots and lots of action, some interesting and some just pedestrian (""What's this flying platform for?"" ""So we can have a fistfight on it.""). And in the end everyone prepares to boldly go where this Star Trek has never gone before, to a galaxy far far away...",1374537600,6,11209,4.6941896024464835

While some people may say that the movie is predictable like the plots of many of the Star Trek movies can be, I really don't think it mattered. The intensity of the actors really pulled in the audience so that you could feel the actions taking place on screen really affected them on a deeply emotional level.

Some may argue that Iron Man 3 is the better movie but I have to say, Into Darkness delivered the kind of action I expect in a summer popcorn movie.

5294744,5,B009934S5M,"For the most part, I enjoyed this movie; the plot is solid, the acting superb, and the special effects and sound are top-notch. However, this film franchise is walking a precarious line in terms of being overindulgent in action and violence, which doesn't adhere to Roddenberry's vision. The writers and director of this revamped franchise claim that they're trying to strike a healthy balance between Roddenberry's Star Trek and what we have now, which is Star Wars where Star Trek hasn't gone before. Don't get me wrong-- I still enjoyed this film, but must say that it's a bit hard to get used to, being a fan of such films as Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country, with their intellectual approach and lighter on action. Speaking of Khan, he was portrayed magnificently in this latest film, and was every bit as evil as the 1982 portrayal of the character. He simply has the right voice to make his character one of the darkest and most menacing in the Star Trek universe. I recommend this film for die-hard fans, and those who want to venture into this series with an open mind.",1374192000,7,1088,4.671875

I think that he even caught on to some of his mannerisms. I was not expecting Star Trek Into Darkness to be better than that one. I absolutely love it. What I liked best about it is that Kirk learns to grow up, and becomes responsible.

5294747,5,B009934S5M,"Without a doubt, this was the movie I was most looking forward to and it did not disappoint.  It had the humour, heart, action and suspense that made it an enjoyable experience.  What I enjoyed most however was seeing the evolution of the crew dynamics.  You can see that they are gelling into the competent command team that's going to be the stuff of legend.

The growth of the relationship between Kirk and Spock is brought across wonderfully.  Pine and Quinto have amazing chemistry that translates very well on screen.

Benedict Cumberbatch is superb as the villain and really brings his character to life.  Very mesmerizing and electric on screen.  He definitely stands out in the sea of bad guys that are flooding the box office this summer.

Star Trek Into Darkness is the only movie so far that I have watched more than once in the cinema this summer and anxiously waited to pre-order.  I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment.

My only peeve is the Spock/Uhura relationship which I  feel they can do away with it or just keep it off screen.  Not every movie needs to have some romantic element spliced into it.  That was the weakest part of the 2009 movie and the same in the sequel.

I guess the romance subplot is to interest female moviegoers, but there are women like myself who can appreciate a strictly action and adventure movie. Furthermore, it just seems so unprofessional and belittles the characters.  I cringe whenever I recall the scene in the shuttle.

Beyond that, outstanding job by cast and crew.",1374105600,6,1538,4.743396226415094
5294748,4,B009934S5M,"The best thing about this movie is the multiple layers of depth. They skillfully deal with paradoxes of life. For example, captain Kirk was confronted with  the question  of saving his friend's life or disobeying  his superior's order. In another instance, he had to decide if he's going to co-operate with one of his enemies to defeat another enemy. Whatever action he took, he would pay dearly. Those situations struck a chord with me. It's because in my daily activities, I also had  the same problems.

There are some scenes with gripping suspense. For example, the scene where the Enterprise space ship was so badly damaged that it could not flee or fight. Then the enemy ship locked their laser guns on it. Its crew's  lives were hung on a thread. How could they escape? What happened next took me completely by surprise.

The acting of most of the actors is believable.

It's more like an interesting drama and thriller than an action film. It has some action scenes but they're not its focus.

Of course, it has some logical holes as any other movies but they don't affect its entertaining value.

The suspense and comedy was great. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto still have a good bro chemistry. They also brought a good laugh and some seriousness in between all the fighting. I just thought there was a little too much fighting that it started to feel overdone (that's why I felt I couldn't give it a full 5 stars). I liked Simon Pegg as Scotty. I felt his attempts to comedy was genuine.

And I know that Benedict Cumberbatch played the villain, but I liked him the most in this movie. I loved loved loved that the J. Paul Getty Museum is the Starfleet Headquarters. I went to that museum about 4 years ago, but recognized it instantly.",1373760000,4,787,4.3175675675675675
5294750,5,B009934S5M,"Warning: A few spoilers lie scattered about in this review, so please read ahead at your own risk.

The first JJ Abrams ""Star Trek"" slipped fondly into my collection because I truly did feel they did a good job with casting. Though the storyline was a tad shaky, it excited me - a Trek fan for my admittedly short life - because I saw potential. ""Trek,"" as it was before, had basically gone everywhere it possibly could, so what else was there to do?

Admittedly, I am wary of reboots. But a re-imagined ""Trek"" excited me, for several reasons. Due to the makeup of the universe itself, an alternate timeline was not really so far fetched. I feel many purists have lost sight of this, and are critical of the films for doing something so ""off-putting,"" though not just time travel, but alternate universes, have been explored several times throughout the original and sequel series. When done correctly - as I feel JJA has done - it is a brilliant device to bring a fresh feel to a beloved universe. After all, ""Star Trek"" in and of itself is all about exploring exciting new worlds, and I feel that easily stretches into exploring exciting new worlds - even if they are old worlds having been altered by a series of events which shook up the familiar. I already go into ST looking for a fun way to escape into the this-close-to-possible, yet still somehow indefinably out-of-reach, so the re-imagining certainly was not a big stretch.

""Into Darkness"" was definitely a character-driven movie. While there were definitely action sequences galore, this ST film delved a little deeper into the psyche of the beloved ""Enterprise"" crew. This, I felt was a bit of a double-edged sword: with something as familiar and beloved as ""Star Trek,"" which did present itself and its characters a certain way in the original, going about exploring how they tick and what's turning them into themselves in the future could go so completely, disastrously wrong. In fact, there were a few times where I came very close to just shaking my head and giving up hope. But, somehow, they managed to draw my attention back.

Most of the returning cast from ""Star Trek 2009"" once again gave convincing performances. Ones who stood out particularly to me, in both the first and second films, were Chris Pine as Kirk (managing to keep the womanizing, irreverent, yet still strong-leading when needed attitude of Shatner while adding a few new flairs which work for the character), Zachary Quinto as Spock (gosh, there were a few times when I felt like they'd managed to turn back the clock and pull a young Leonard Nimoy out of the past to reprise his role!), and Karl Urban as Bones (I loved the original Bones so much, I was ready to hate the new one - but Karl is so convincing, I just couldn't!). The actor who plays Chekov also did a great job once again, though his appearances in ""Into Darkness"" weren't as numerous as I'd hoped. There were, however, disappointments. I felt Uhura was not nearly as strong a character as she was in the original (more on that later), and I have not agreed with the casting of Simon Pegg from the beginning. While he could have been a good Scotty, were there not a better Scotty in the wings (Paul McGillion, who even LOOKS like the original!), he just doesn't seem to have clicked with the rest of the cast. It always feels to me as if he's running behind the others, desperately trying to catch up and always stumbling over his own two verbal feet. I'm not saying he's not a good actor - he's just not necessarily a good Scotty.

Below are the most notable Pros and Cons I took away from the movie (SPOILERS AHEAD!):

PROS:

1) Parts of the storyline. ""Wrath of Kahn"" is without a doubt the best original-series ST movie - perhaps the best ST movie of all time - and a reboot of it walks a very fine line. I thought JJA did a good job taking the original and updating it to fit the world as it is today, though the original is so good it just is not outdated, and I doubt it ever will be. And ""Space Seed"" is still in my top 3 favorite original series episodes, hands-down.

2) Cast characterization. As I mentioned above, Pine, Quinto, and Urban all delivered amazing performances as Kirk, Spock, and Bones. Peter Wellers also thrilled as a secondary villain, this close to being over the top but still salvaging the performance to make him a chillingly good bad guy.

3) CGI. My gosh, advances in technology never cease to amaze me. When I go to a ST movie, I can BELIEVE that the ""Enterprise"" really exists, that somehow they have managed to put a camera crew in space and capture a real ship doing all these things. The original ""Enterprise"" has always been one of the most beautiful ships in the entire ST fleet from beginning to end, and her redesign for ""Into Darkness"" - while not without its flaws, admittedly - holds true to the one from the TV show.

4) The score. Once again, the score plays just as huge a part in the movie as the characters and the action. I got chills several times throughout the film because the music was just that incredible. It's a mix of gentle strains and pounding drums that perfectly accent whatever is happening on the screen, and even if you hate the film, the soundtrack is certainly worthy of being added to your music collection, because it can stand alone.

CONS:

1) The storyline. While in some ways, ""Into Darkness"" did a good job refreshing the ""Wrath of Kahn"" storyline, it was not without its errors. Immersing ""Enterprise"" in the water did seem jarring to me. She was never meant to be taken into a planet's atmosphere, let alone landed or submerged! While it did make for an incredible shot when it appeared out of the water, I felt the story could have done without it. Kirk's disobeying the Prime Directive wasn't explored to its full potential, which did sadden me. His actions did not only have an effect on himself, but the Federation in general and Spock in particular, not to mention his entire crew. Also, the attack on Starfleet's highest-ranking officers, while an incredible and very emotional sequence, didn't seem to have an overall effect on the outcome of the movie, or on the psyche of the characters. That was a very traumatizing event for those who survived, and for the loved ones of those who didn't, not to mention Starfleet in general. I felt this could have been explored a little better beyond what little we saw in the heat of the moment, as it happened. Also, there were little inconsistencies scattered about which, while not making the film any less enjoyable, did irk me a bit as it happened. (Bones, for instance, changing his mind about being able to bring people out of stasis. Um... Were you not able to do that just an hour ago, and now suddenly you're an expert?)

2) Cast characterizations. I have never agreed with Simon Pegg's casting as Scotty, and I felt his portrayal went downhill in this movie. It was so-so in ""Star Trek 2009,"" but other than being in the right place at the right time in ""Into Darkness,"" he didn't really play that important of a part. Any other character, not even central to the original storyline, could have slipped into Scotty's place and still made thins work. (Though Scotty's sidekick is certainly a show-stealer - Deep Roy's performance is far more convincing, and he never says a word!) Also, Uhura really annoyed me in this movie. I felt she was whiny and clingy, and it deviated severely from her portrayal both in the original series and in the 2009 movie. Uhura was a female character in a world dominated by men in the original series, and she had the spunk and sass and strength to carry it off. She didn't take anything from anyone. But here, I felt like she was one of the weakest characters in the entire movie.

3) Spock/Uhura. While I know this idea was kind of explored in the original series, it was portrayed by very small hints here and there which could be appreciated or ignored, however one's opinion leaned. In ""Into Darkness,"" however, it played such a huge part I felt like it was trying to take over the movie. Part of Spock's appeal is making us women feel like we want to be the one to break through his Vulcan exterior and make him feel, and it seems like Uhura is the logical (sorry for the pun) choice for such a role, being the consistent female presence on ""Enterprise."" However, I just don't think the actor and actress have the right chemistry to pull it off, and their interactions not only wound up feeling painful and forced because of it, but it bogged down the storyline and made me want to facepalm and forever swear off romantic relationships forevermore in ST. (And this from a hard-core 'shipper in general.)

4) The Klingons. Though they were made to seem a huge threat throughout the movie, we didn't really get all that much exploration with them. Aside from seeing them for one massive fight scene in the middle of the movie, they were mentioned a lot but stayed in the background. They've always been one of the most fascinating races in Trek canon, and here they just seemed - well, really, a joke, I'm sorry to say. Or a tool used to create an ""ohmigosh are they suddenly going to come out of nowhere and go nuts?"" that never really went anywhere...

Things which could go either way:

1) THE SCENE towards the end. This is a HUGE point of contention for moviegoers, I've noticed. My cousin is a purist in the extreme, and I heard him rant about this in ways that made me rethink my own views on the topic. On the flip side, my mother is also a purist (though not quite to the extreme of my cousin), and she seemed pretty okay with it. As for me, I'm on the fence. While I think it could be a brilliant ploy, reversing the original way it was told, I also think it might be the movie's biggest downfall. One thing I've been most excited about for the new ""Trek"" movies is their ability to take the old and make it fresh, because they have an entirely new timeline to explore. But taking a scene as well-known and iconic as the death scene in ""Wrath of Kahn"" and doing it - nearly verbatim - just in reverse... Well, I'm still not sure about it. So I'll have to put this in my either way column.

2) Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn. I will be the first to admit I am NOT a BC fan. I can't stand him as Sherlock, and I've rabidly avoided most of his other work for that reason. I think he plays Sherlock almost as a villain (though we know Holmes is smart enough to commit a crime and never be caught, I'm pretty sure we're not actually, seriously supposed to suspect him), and I hate what he's done to one of my most beloved characters. For that reason alone, I thought he would be a very convincing Kahn. And he was ... to a certain extent. He certainly had the cold looks, the monotonous voice, and the stilted posture to carry off the role, but his sheer British-ness very nearly killed it. I know Ricardo, who played the original Kahn, was not from the same place as the fictional Kahn's origins, but at least he LOOKED the part. The fact he's a well-known and loved actor, I think, made them desperate to cast him just to get the fanbase into the theater. And while it seemed to work - and like I said, just going solely by his characterization, he made it work - I did not think he WAS Kahn. Not like the original. Is there another actor out there who could have looked, sounded, and felt the part? Perhaps, perhaps not. The original is a tough act to follow. But I'm certain there were others who could have done a better job than BC. So he landed in my ""could go either way"" column as well.

3) Kirk's being brought back to life. Besides the fact there were plenty of other people whose blood could have been used to bring him back, I thought it was a bit cowardly to wait only twenty minutes before reviving him. If you're going to kill him, at least leave him dead and us wondering until the next movie. The reason why this ended up in my uncertain column is because, the more I think about it, the more I wonder if they're planning to follow this up in the future. After all, now Kirk has a part of Kahn in him. How could that possibly impact him, as a person, a captain, a hero, in the future? Maybe not even in a physical sense, but I certainly feel this has potential as emotional and psychological trauma which could play an interesting part in future films.

Overall, I give the film 4.5 out of 5 stars. It was a very enjoyable film, and I do certainly look forward to seeing it again and again, and I will definitely purchase a copy of it. Thank you for reading my review, and I hope it helped some of you who felt a bit on the fence about whether or not to see it.",1373760000,6,12664,4.44808272296424
5294751,4,B009934S5M,"I loved the awesome action and effects.  It was a fun movie from start to finish.  A few things came a minor surprises, but most was pretty predictable.  The 'enemy' starship was incredible!  I advise it to any action or sci-fi fan.

However, there are a few things that bugged me and kept me from enjoying it fully.  Apparently, with the suspension of the normal behavior of gravity came the ability for people to walk on walls.  When a starship has power, it apparently just hangs in space, and as soon as it loses power, it falls directly toward Earth, never mind the fact that the nearest gravity well is the Moon.  While falling, and having no power, apparently the people inside don't experience freefall, but rather have to deal with 'down' being the direction toward Earth, regardless of where they are in space, and thus the wall walking.  Also, the skinniest guy on the crew is apparently able to pull two of the heftier crew members up with one arm, as well, despite what seems like Earth normal gravity.  Also, the momentum built up from falling from a near lunar orbit down to Earth's cloud layer is reversible in just a couple seconds, without affecting the crew.  The rest I can't talk about without major spoilers, so I'll just leave it with this.

I only take one star off for those blaring missteps.  JJ really failed us on that aspect, but I forgive him.  The missteps I mention are only a small part of the film, and the rest is just so much fun.  Overall, I loved it, but it is not perfect.",1373673600,3,1511,4.463503649635037
5294752,5,B009934S5M,"When people look at Star Trek, they see several versions from television to the movies.  When JJ Abrahms took the lead for the new movie series, he truly has taken the franchise where no person, or man has gone before!  Think about it, whe Captain Kirk and the crew were on T.V. it was always about him.  When the movies came, it was about the whole crew.  Next, Patrick Stewart... The next generation was about the whole crew from the beginning, which really made the franchise even better.  Fast forward to the new movies... The first is when Jim Kirk, Spock, Checkov, etc, first meet.... encounter a villian from a time-warp and succeed in defeating him.  The second movie... explains who Khan is...what a provocative move! Imagine how the next movie will phase Khan in before finally being exiled....plus possibly a new villian? This is a definite 5 plus star series of movies to come!",1373587200,4,889,4.703225806451613
5294753,1,B009934S5M,"I admit I am hardcore Trekkie, a hardline fan, for me Star Trek is part of my life, not just watch a movie occasionally or a vague memory, because of that I know with certainty that Star Trek has always been something more than special effects , explosions and screams, I am also aware that times change, and the need to adapt to market needs, perfect, I understand that.
But I will never accept the lack of creativity, of people like Damon Lindelof, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (writers) who along with JJ Abrams (director)has not only departed from what Star Trek had meaning since its origin but in fact destroyed it in just 4 years and with only two films. I think they can do something better, not just copying what already exists, put two or three touches and voila! That's not an homage to the old movies, is a desecration I think JJ Abrams an company can put all the special effects they want, and all the explosions they want, and all the screaming and fuss , but TELLING AN ORIGINAL STORY is that to much to ask??? think about this, what can we expect from the upcoming films? or the next TV series if that were the case? the same episodes,??? the same scripts we already know???? only one or two different things to fit in that so-called alternate time line????? Are we so mediocre as the public that we can not demand new stories??? If the whole damn thing will be only to copy what already exist (arguments and scripts) to make them compatible to the ""temporal alternate line"" then Star Trek is really dead, is dead and we don't want to accept it . Really I rather see the franchise dead, that to be looking the next 20 years all movies and episodes of the original series ""recycled"" .

5294759,3,B009934S5M,"Having been majorly impressed by the 2009 reboot of Star Trek, naturally I was excited about seeing ""Star Trek - Into Darkness"".  I enjoyed it and like that J.J. Abrams is keeping to the original Star Trek's roots via great casting and playing with previous story lines (Admiral Christopher Pike, Khan, the elder Spock, etc.) due to the `time rift' in the 2009 remake.

The reason for 3 stars instead of 5 for ""Into Darkness"" is due to the lack of emotion and depth coming from the cast in this one.  Something was off or missing in their performances that was there wholeheartedly in the 2009 reboot.  I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatch and perceive him as a top notch actor; however his Khan portrayal was nowhere near as good as the original by Ricardo Montalban.  Nor was there much depth in what should have been an extremely emotional scene between Kirk and Spock when their roles were switched and Kirk was dying.  In the ""Wrath of Khan"" that scene was fantastic and drenched with so much emotion and sadness that you could drown in a pool of your own tears (go back and watch it if you don't believe me)!  In this one, I didn't care much whether Kirk died or not - lol - and as a Star Trek fan, that is tragic.

I enjoyed ""Star Trek - Into Darkness"" and if I get the chance, I may go see it again or rent it when it comes out simply because I love everything about Star Trek.  That said, it seemed like the cast just showed up, read their lines then went home which is a far cry from what they did in the first one.

The reboot, in general, is brilliant. I loved the first movie and Into Darkness did not dissapoint. I was admittedly concerned about Abrahms directing as I am not a fan of his other movies, but he's done a great job with this! The reboot pays homage to the original characters while still putting a new twist to them. I love the new, more ""human"" Spock, the very humorous Scotty, the more edgy Uhura, and the ultra cocky new Kirk. The new Kahn is so much more freightening than he ever was in the series or the old movie. I just love the edgy feeling of the reboot.

5294762,4,B009934S5M,"FAIR WARNING: This review contains some MAJOR spoilers so if you haven't seen the movie, read with caution!

Reading through the reviews posted for Star Trek Into Darkness, they appear to fall into two camps: one (by far the largest) unadulterated love for the movie, the other (notably smaller) unadulterated hatred for the same movie.

Question is, where does the truth lie? Is it ""the movie of the year"" or ""absolute cr@p""?

It's complicated.

My wife thought it was terrific, but then again she thinks Chris Pine is hot and that was the major reason for seeing the movie (as with the original reboot in 2009). She thought the story made sense, the effects were awesome, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Her biggest quibble was that it appeared there was something weird with Chris Pine's lower lip, like he'd had collagen injections.

If you're a long-time Trekkie (like me), it's a mix of love and hate. On the one hand, the effects are awesome. If you're a fan more of TOS than TNG, then you probably liked the 2009 reboot (as I did) because although different it does recapture the sense of fun and adventure that TOS had. And Into Darkness effectively continues what was started in the 2009 reboot. It's fun, its got a good, rousing adventure and it is spectacular to look at.

But there are quibbles. First, why Khan? It could have been a completely new villain and the story been just as good. That's a minor quibble though compared to the bigger quibble. And that's the reversal of the death seen from Wrath of Khan (Kirk dies instead of Spock) and Zachary Quinto (as Spock) trying to outdo Shatner's ""Khan"" yell (also from Wrath of Khan). Couldn't they have come up with a different way rather than shameless stealing? So to me it ruined what otherwise was a rollicking fun ride.

I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could, because I am torn. For the most part, it was just as much fun as the 2009 reboot and I did enjoy it. But the theft of key scenes from Wrath of Khan (still, by far, the superior movie) forces me to lower it to 4 stars. Is it the movie of the year? No, in my opinion it is so far a tie between Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel. Into Darkness is a distant third. It's light years better than Hansel and Gretel (glad I waited to see that on a flight to Europe and even gladder that there were other movies I could watch when I quickly realized what drek that was) or A Good Day to Die Hard (wish I'd waited for the flight to see that!).",1373068800,2,2450,4.371428571428571

Abrams hits another home run with ""Star Trek Into Darkness"".  In this newest Trek movie, Abrams manages to give non-Trek fans a rousing action story, outstanding special effects, another excellent score by composer Michael Giacchino and, for Trek fans, all of this plus some good-natured nods to previous movies (although some were offended by this; more on this point later).  Also, in the spirit of the original Star Trek television series, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-IV-The-Voyage-Home/dp/B000I3PA8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Insurrection/dp/B000IZA9NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: Insurrection</a>, Abrams gives us a ""message"" movie with commentary on current events (*minor spoiler* in this movie Kirk is ordered by his superior officer to destroy a terrorist in enemy territory via the use of long-range torpedoes).

After turning in excellent performances in the 2009 movie, the cast is once again outstanding in this film.  Chris Pine continues to channel William Shatner and yet put his own stamp on the role of Captain James T. Kirk; a remarkable achievement by a remarkable actor.  Likewise, Zachary Quinto expertly balances Leonard Nimoy's portrayal of Spock with his own mix of melancholy and occasional bursts of emotion and even anger.  After the destruction of his planet in the previous film, I completely buy into the idea that his Spock would show more emotion than Nimoy's.

The rest of the cast also turns in good performances- Karl Urban is very good but slightly underused as Bones McCoy, John Cho as Sulu gets a nice scene of his own, Anton Yelchin as Chekov makes the most of his screen time, and Zoe Saldana is used well again as Uhura.  Alice Eve is also good as Dr. Carol Marcus, but is not given much to do; most likely she was introduced in this film with the intent of featuring her more prominently in the next movie.  Simon Pegg as Scotty is both heroic and hilarious in this film, and steals several scenes.

*Major Spoilers Ahead re: Villains* Peter Weller appears as the corrupt Starfleet admiral Alexander Marcus, and makes an effective villain.  Special mention must be made of Benedict Cumberbatch, who *Major Spoiler* plays Khan.  Cumberbatch's Khan is just as villainous as the classic Khan and even more brutal, but yet manages to explain his actions to the extent that while you may not agree with what he does, it still makes a certain degree of sense from his point of view.  Cumberbatch is so good in the role that I think he turns in a Heath Ledger Joker-esque performance as Khan, and I really hope we see him again in a future sequel.  While some fans object to his nationality (in comparison to the classic Khan's nationality), I feel that, as with any film, some imagination must be used when you go to see a movie.

*Major Spoiler*  As I mentioned earlier, some fans have been offended by the movie's references to previous events in Star Trek.  In particular, some fans have been offended by the nod to the famous ending to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-II-The-Wrath-of-Khan-HD/dp/B0094K20FK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan [HD</a>] when in this film Kirk sacrifices himself (albeit temporarily) to save the Enterprise, and then shares an emotional goodbye with Spock through a transparent door.  I know some disagree, but I thought this was an interesting way to turn Spock's sacrifice in Star Trek II on its head while, at the same time, reverse the ultimate meaning of the farewell between the two friends.  As screenwriter Bob Orci has explained, in Star Trek II Kirk and Spock are sharing a final goodbye as the culmination of decades of friendship; whereas in this movie, this emotional moment is really the true beginning of their friendship.  I disagree completely with the notion that this moment is a ""copy and paste"" rip-off of Star Trek II.

Does this movie edge out ""Star Trek II"" as the best Star Trek movie (IMHO) in my mind?  Close, but for one nitpick- the movie's use of the Enterprise.  The Enterprise has always been as much of a character in Star Trek as Kirk, Spock, Picard, Data, etc.  It has always been much more than an airplane, helicopter, etc., or something simply used to ferry our characters from Point A to Point B in the story.  *Spoiler*  While the Enterprise manages to hang tough in the face of heavy fire from Admiral Marcus' secret battleship U.S.S. Vengeance, it never returns fire to defeat its adversary, which I think is a storytelling flaw.  In Star Trek II and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-VI-The-Undiscovered-Country/dp/B000HZGNDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</a>, the Enterprise takes heavy damage, but also eventually overcomes its enemy starship adversaries in those films.  In this film, the Vengeance is eventually disabled in a clever ploy undertaken by Spock, but I think it would have been more satisfying from a storytelling point of view if its comeuppance had been delivered by the Enterprise herself.

On that subject, after the Scimitar in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Nemesis/dp/B000IZA9PI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: Nemesis</a>, the Narada in Star Trek (2009), and the Vengeance in Star Trek Into Darkness, I think the writers have mined the ""massive powerful battleship versus the smaller, less powerful Enterprise"" plotline enough.  I hope the next film gives us a more evenly matched naval engagement between the Enterprise and the enemy vessel, where the Enterprise prevails.

In summary, Star Trek Into Darkness is an excellent film for Star Trek fans and non-Trek fans of action/adventure films alike, and should not be missed.  Live Long and Prosper!",1372896000,15,6283,5.65814696485623

I think part of the lacking / wanting was the 2009 movie set a 'brave new course' for the franchise, but this movie just hacked ideas from the old series where it could've gone off on completely new tangents.

The only actor that provided any real gravitas was Peter Weller. Benedict Cumberbatch's talent was wasted.

The movie felt like a Frankenstein monster. while parts and pieces of other scripts were bulk cut and pasted into this and the stitching is visible. I'll avoid spoilers here. But there were a couple moments I grimaced and said ""come onnn"".

I'll still buy it on release, because I loved the visual effects. The USS Vengeance was fierce. Why were the Enterprise warp effects changed between the two movies?

The original series had an ENORMOUS impact on me when I was growing up and it's a great pleasure to see the characters portrayed so skillfully by good actors and treated with so much respect by the scriptwriter.

5294771,3,B009934S5M,"When Star Trek Into Darkness came into a cinema near me, I knew I had to instantly go and see it. For one thing, the trailers looked great, promising a dark, action-packed film where the stakes were high and the threat was even higher. For another thing, it had Benedict Cumberbatch in it, a consistently good player, as well as a fine cast that included Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, and Peter Weller. The reviews were (mostly) positive, too. So I went and saw it. I had a good time.

But I left the theatre with mixed feelings. When I was invited to see it a second time, I saw the film with renewed concentration. I weighed the good, and I weighed the bad. And the film was found wanting.

But before you click that dislike button, hear me out. But be warned, there are spoilers below.

First, lets see what I DID like:
1. Benedict Cumberbatch is the boss! He makes every film he is in better, whether he's acting as a giant dragon or a fussy detective. He is up to par, as expected, in Into Darkness. He is definitely the high point of the film, even if his character has got some script issues.

2. Another equally good antagonist is horror icon Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus. His scene-stealing ultra-bad-dude gets some great lines (""You will run this bastard down"") and fun scenes. He reminds me of the film it could have been.

3. Michael Giaccino. Wow! The J.J. Abrams staple has outdone himself with his score, which ranges from beautiful piano to pounding drums. The score in the London hospital scenes is incredibly brilliant.

4. The action is great! And there's lots of it to behold. Love the mixes of martial arts!

5. You know who else I liked? That little mute alien that travels around with Scotty. No kidding! Give that guy an Oscar!

Now, for what I did NOT like:
1. OK, lets start with the very beginning. I sat down in the darkened cinema, and the film began. Everything was blurry and out of focus. Aha! I forgot to put on my 3D glasses. I put them on my head. Everything was dark, blurry, and out of focus. Please tell me I am not the only one who thinks 3D is overrated. Like this review if you think 3D is overrated. Now, I completely understand 3D as a TOOL to tell stories. James Cameron used it brilliantly in Avatar, as did Scorsese in Hugo, Ang Lee in Life of Pi, and Peter Jackson in The Hobbit. Those films are only made BETTER because of it.

But let me get this straight: 3D should not be put in for making money, to appeal to younger audiences, or as a joke. Superhero movies do not need to be in 3D. The Great Gatsby does not need to be in 3D. Neither does The Last Airbender, Alice in Wonderland, or The Jonas Brothers 3D Concert Video. Star Trek Into Darkness did not NEED to be in 3D.

2. The opening salvo looked like it was being filmed by a hyper-caffeinated teenager with ADD. A person beside me muttered ""It looks like a video game."" Indeed, with the bright colors, fake-looking 3D, lens flares, and out-of-focus shaky cam so shaky it would make Jason Bourne jealous, it did indeed remind one of a video game. But is that a bad thing?

3. And here's my biggest problem with the film: the lack of emotion.
Near the beginning of the movie, a Starfleet officer is blackmailed by Khan into blowing up the London Starfleet headquarters. We are supposed to feel sorry for this guy, we are almost TOLD to feel sorry for him (with lots of lingering shots on his sick daughter and saddened face), but we do not. The explosion itself is cold and distant, and not in a good way.
Iron Man 3 also has a couple suicide bombings, and while it's not a perfect film, you actually feel for the characters. They appear human in our eyes, and the incident is all the more shocking because the stakes are that much higher.
Not so in Into Darkness. Instead of feeling sorry for the characters, the audience instead is wondering how such a tiny ring makes such a ludicrously large explosion.

Even worse, the explosion is never brought up again, except very briefly. We see no ordinary people affected by it, which makes it hard to feel for the characters, and worse, we don't feel that Khan is actually much of a villain either. Are we supposed to feel sorry for him? That never comes about either.

In another scene, Spock and Uhura talk about their feelings while flying in Klingon airspace. ""Are they really doing this right now?"" another person beside me asked. I knew what Abrams was trying to do. He was lulling us into a false sense of calm, just to pull a jump scare. And, on queue, it happened. Boom. Yawn. Did I mention that said action scene was AWESOME?

There is one action scene where Chekov is sliding down the floor of the Enterprise screaming. I thought he was going to die. But he didn't. The action fell flat. If Chekov had died, who knows how brilliant this film could have been? In the original Star Trek franchise, Spock died. Sure, he was raised again, but at the cost of the Enterprise. To quote another critic, the first series weren't perfect, but at least they were daring. They raised the stakes.
Kirk dies in Star Trek Into Darkness, but he is resurrected a few minutes later. Why didn't he stay dead, at least until the inevitable sequel? Think how brave that film could have been! Even when Admiral Pike dies we don't feel sad. It just felt like the mandatory killing off of *that* character to generate sympathy.

4. The script. Now this is a time where we can all rally together and point fingers at someone: Damon Lindelof. The guy who ruined Lost, Cowboys and Aliens, Prometheus, and Star Trek Into Darkness. That guy is cinematic poison. It took a second viewing to see all the chinks in the armour. As I said before, Cumberbatch is phenomenal, but when he says ""You, you can't even break a rule, how can you be expected to break bone?"" the seriousness falls out of the story. Lindelof is trying too hard to give him cool lines. Then there's the question of the misogynistic, unnecessary, gratuitous, completely offensive changing scene with Alice Eve (is it just me or is her character somewhat unnecessary?). This got so many bad reviews that Lindelof had to issue an official apology via Twitter.
There are a myriad of plotholes pointed out by other cinemaphiles. Some you notice and care about, some you don't.
Namely, there's the little ""Khan's magic blood"" twist, which gave many reviewers the impression that Abrams did not know whether he wanted to distance himself from the first franchise and create something new, or follow in older footsteps. The film tries to ""homage"" older films, but only succeeds in making a mess.

...

The result? Not a BAD film. No, not at all. Just a film that could have been so much greater. Did I hate Star Trek Into Darkness? I rather enjoyed it; it's not a bad film at all. It's a great action blockbuster. Abrams and Co. have created a film we can all enjoy, regardless of issues. In conclusion: Hov Trek Into Darkness is dun qu' tIv poH 'ej lathl QaQ movie, with op ay! Pardon my Klingon, it's never been a strong point.

I think the original ST2-TWoK  was the best trek movie ever and it has a special place in my heart. When I found out the ""new"" villian was Kahn I figured I would hate this movie even more than I hated the 1st remake with this new crew (don't ask about Star Trek by JJ Abrahms #1).
I am so glad I went and saw this anyway (I figured the 3D would at least be interesting)! It remains gently respectful of the original series with tons of homages, if you catch them, without desecrating the old series. The characters feel more like the original crew, thank God, instead of the clowns in the first movie.

5294774,3,B009934S5M,"Even being a fan of the old series and all the Trek incarnations, I can't give this a full recommendation.
Sure, its great to see all the cast together for another go-round but the writing is what makes this movie not so memorable. Instead of some great character moments, the writers decide to go for over-the-top action instead of the humanity/friendship angle that the original series and movies proved sucessfully.
We also get major plot developments here, only to be undone with a reset button twenty minutes to half an hour later. It  cheapens the drama if someone that dies, is brought back to life. If someone's ship is taken away, only to conveniently get it back soon after.

My other issue is, that if you are going to reboot something like Trek, don't start redoing movies that have already been done. This movie takes a character from the original series and TWOK and makes him over with far less success (or impact) than the original source material. If you have a clean slate, why can't the writers be a bit more imaginative? Whole scenes are copied and not even well enough to be considered as an homage. It just seems lazy and unnecessary.
 They had a couple of years to write this Sequel after the sucessful 2009 movie so it could have been so much more Engaging. What happened in the writers room? We're they more concerned about aiming for a general audience and dumbing it down than giving us some meat along with the action for true Trek Fans.",1372204800,9,1465,4.605363984674329
5294775,4,B009934S5M,"For fans new to the Star Trek series, ""Into Darkness"" is an entertaining if hyperactive tour of Kirk, Spock, Bones and the Enterprise.  But for fans of ""Wrath of Khan"" it acts as an additional layer of enjoyment for that acts as another voice in a Star Trek chorus.  It also sometimes feels like ""Into Darkness"" is so enchanted with its predecessor that it doesn't even try and instead settles exclusively on one long homage.

The gang's all here, putting on their game faces to play the parts they established in the first film: Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Bones (Karl Urban).  But despite the supposed freedom of having no longer to establish a back story, ""Into Darkness"" is slavishly dedicated to reimagining ""Wrath of Khan,"" down to the same lines from the script.  But for fans who remember the original, ""Into Darkness"" adds another layer of complexity, inverting roles, putting lines in different characters' mouths, and turning threats into opportunities.  It also takes the devil-may-care challenges that Kirk finally admitted to in ""Wrath of Khan"" -- tantamount to the scriptwriters admitting that they were on Kirk's side all along -- and tore the veil away to let us know that anything was possible.

=== ""Wrath of Khan"" ===

David Marcus: Lieutenant Saavik was right: You never have faced death.

Kirk: No. Not like this. I haven't faced death. I've cheated death. I've tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.

=========

Thing is, William Shatner as Kirk was over 50 years old at the time he said those words.  In the younger Kirk's mouth they are prescient -- it changes the tone from a mid-life crisis to a quarter-life crisis, and given the reboot perhaps that's appropriate.

That doesn't diminish the love note to the original.  ""Into Darkness"" becomes all the more poignant in what it's trying to say -- that friendship is tenuous, that leadership is difficult, that being a leader means making the tough choices -- by making its comparisons to the sacrifices made in ""Wrath of Khan.""  The Kobayashi Maru test figures prominently, testing the mettle of both captains with similar outcomes -- only in ""Into Darkness"" we get to see Kirk's famous workaround.  The simulation is a proxy for the audience experiencing the movie's high stakes.

===""Into Darkness"" ===

Christopher Pike: Do you know what a pain you are? You think the rules don't apply to you. There's greatness in you, but there's not an ounce of humility. You think that you can't make mistakes, but there's going to come a moment when you realize you're wrong about that, and you're going to get yourself and everyone under your command killed.

=========

The burden of the captain is a heavy one, ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,"" but like an immature sibling ""Into Darkness"" isn't able to face the consequences of death as seriously.  ""Into Darkness"" has no interest in exceeding the original -- it's content to simply imitate it with a wink and a nod, diverging cleverly to disrupt our expectations while managing to be surprisingly conventional.  And in that regard ""Into Darkness"" is both charming and frustrating in its inability to live up to ""Wrath of Khan."" That doesn't make it any less fun.",1372118400,3,3274,4.840215439856373
5294776,5,B009934S5M,"First of all, I think the people who gave this movie 1 star have the right to voice their opinions, but to say that it was garbage and that JJ Abrhams can't direct is just wrong.  I loved it.  I even compared it with the original, which was wonderful.  But I'm probably the only one, I don't know about others, who thought this Star Trek sequel was better than the original Star Trek II.  Before everyone jumps on me, let me explain.

With Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan you had to know who Khan is and how he came to hate Kirk and for people to know Khan you need to go back to the original series episode ""Space Seed"".

In Into Darkness the whole Khan thing is explained in the movie.  And plus, the acting is not too overly done and no one person is on the screen for more than they need to be.

I really recommend this for anyone.  Although, I do recommend seeing the 2009 Star Trek first to get to know the new crew.",1371945600,6,921,4.044198895027624
5294777,5,B009934S5M,"I loved the first JJ Abrams Star Trek movie and couldn't wait for film 2. This time round, we decided to take our children(11&13) not knowing what they would think because they showed no interest in the series on tv when they were little. Before the film, I didn't want to give our kids the scoop on the film for fear of the tween and teen eye rolling contest and the: ""I am bored already"". It was a risk I had to take because I loved the first JJ Abrams Star Trek movie....After the film, my oldest asks if we can watch every episode in the original Star Trek series! YES! It is wonderful that Star Trek Into Darkness sparked an interest in our children. They loved the movie as much as me: the characters and their conflicts, the colors, the sets, aliens, non-stop action, the lens flares, the enterprise, the story,,,,Kirk saying: ""I just wants to rip the f---- bangs off Spock""(kirk doesn't swear there, if you are worried). Funny! I loved the original Star Trek series when I was a kid and this new Star Trek movie brings back all the fun and adventure I felt as a kid watching the original Star Trek series. Star Trek Into Darkness is a fantastic modern recreation of the original Star Trek series. I can allow the new actors of the JJ Abrams Star Trek movies be the nearly perfect reincarnation of the original cast. Chris Pine is a fabulous Captain Kirk! Spock is Spock! My kids laugh at Scotty and Bones -wow, it works for me, my husband and now with my kids. We saw the film 4 times in the theaters and my kids say that's not enough! Thanks to JJ Abrams. Now, JJ can't stay too long with Star Wars! He needs to get back to the Star Trek universe soon!",1371859200,4,1661,4.3099041533546325

5294779,2,B009934S5M,"STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is an extremely watchable movie. That is because of JJ Abrams. Say what you will about JJ Abrams, the man is a talented visual stylist. The way his camera moves, his edits, the set piece sequences he creates are all pretty great. He can make any movie fun. Hell, I even like his overuse of lens flares. His work in these areas is once again excellent in STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS. Unfortunately, he's never worked with a good script. When MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3 is the best script you've worked with, you're not doing too hot. Most impressive is Abrams' ability to make watchable, even sometimes good movies out of bad scripts. Abrams, along with his excellent cast, do their best again here in STID, but the script they are working from is just too vile to save.

Again, most of the movie was very watchable. It never ""feels"" like Star Trek (whatever that means) to me, but it was enjoyable, in a dumb, obvious 9/11 allegory sci fi way. (Btw, have these writers seen the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA reboot? Cuz they kinda already did the whole space-opera-as-9/11 metaphor thing. 10 years ago. Before the allegory had been done a million times.) Honestly it felt more like a dumber version of Mass Effect than it did Star Trek. And I was fine with that. I love Mass Effect! But then, the wheels start falling off the wagon.

Spoilers ahead.

For context, I looooove THE WRATH OF KHAN. I'm not crazy about everything relating to Star Trek, but that movie is great. So when STID very openly invites comparisons between itself and TWOK, it looks absolutely foolish in comparison, and frankly, made me mad. The writers may love TWOK like I do, but I don't think for a second they understand WHY that movie is great. Let's break this down into the two plot elements that most directly relate to TWOK.

1.) Khan - The reason Khan is the most popular villain in Star Trek is because a) Ricardo Montalban's pecs and b) Khan has a history with Kirk and he wants revenge. When Eggs Benedict Cumberbund reveals himself to actually be Khan, NOT A SINGLE CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE CARES because he has no history with anyone. Hell, he hasn't even been talked about prior to this reveal. His name could have been John Bon Poopypants for all they care. It is a ""reveal"" that only exists for fan service and it falls completely flat. And then after that, he bears absolutely zero resemblance to any Khan I remember. Basically what they did was name a generic bad guy Khan for the fans when it really had no bearing on the movie they were making.

2.) The Self Sacrifice Ending Inversion - This is the one that pissed me off. Kirk sacrificing himself for his crew and ship is a pretty obvious ending to his arc in this movie, at least after Pike spells out what he needs to do to be a good captain. But why, for the love of god, why, reprise Spock's sacrificial ending in TWOK? Why turn what should be an emotional moment into one where the writers are elbowing you in the side going, ""Eh? Eh? See what we're doing here? Eh? Get it?"" It was even worse for me because I knew pretty quickly that they weren't even going to follow through with Kirk's death and they were going to cop out with Magical Khan Blood (dumbest plot device ever, btw), basically rendering Kirk's arc completely pointless.

TWOK is great because, on top of being a great popcorn film, every element of that movie comes together to say something about life and death and the relationship between the two. The Genesis project, Kirk having a son, Khan being a villain from Kirk's past, Kirk feeling old, and Spock sacrificing himself are all about these things. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. STID has no understanding of this. STID just takes a couple surface elements from this great movie and throws them in its movie and thinks that's enough. What it is instead is a hollow and cynical re-appropriation of the genuine article, and at that point all you're doing is fan-fiction. BAD fan-fiction.

I do, however, have a few friends who have never seen TWOK and they all think this movie is great. So if you've never seen the masterpiece that is THE WRATH OF KHAN and have no interest in doing so, maybe you'll like this.

STAR WARS RELATED POST SCRIPT: Honestly at this point, the only hope I have for STAR WARS EPISODE VII is that Orci, Kurtzman, and Lindelof won't be involved at all and based on Michael Arndt's previous work, EPISODE VII will be quite easily the best script Abrams has worked with. It'll at least look nice...",1371772800,16,4512,4.534398034398034
5294780,5,B009934S5M,"I'm a child of the Star Trek generation and I have always felt a sense of ""hope"" in watching the Star Trek series.
This movie gave me a nice jolt of that feeling. Our country and our planet are in serious peril at this time but watching
these movies helps me not to lose hope in our future.  I've seen all of the original 60's TV series and all of the movies in the past. I own all but 2 or 3 of the movies(the very 1st one with a bald woman was pretty bad).
  I've read all of the 1 star reviews from the ""haters"" and agree there is room for improvement. But considering how many bad movies I've seen over my lifetime this film doesn't even come close to being a bad movie. How many superhero remakes are going to be made? This summer's heroes are Superman and The Lone Ranger. Both are completely outdated. Neither one could do anything to stop the Taliban. IRONMAN 3? REALLY? I fell asleep during the first one, it was so boring in the beginning. 2-hated it. 3-will rent it but probably dislike it. Sadly, not enough people appreciate what STAR TREK is really about. It brings hope to fans today and it has brought hope and inspiration to millions of people around the world since the 1960's.",1371772800,3,1195,4.278761061946903
5294781,5,B009934S5M,"First, I assume that most people know about the movie itself at this point, so I'll start out by talking about the media. We got the 3D blu ray and just played it for the first time. We've only had a 3D set for about a year now, so our 3D collection is still somewhat limited. However, it does include The Avengers, Avatar, and John Carter of Mars ... all excellent 3D presentations. I honestly think that this topped all of the others. The opening credits were particularly noteworthy. Everything about the blu ray was top notch, as is normally the case with blu rays of recent films. Both picture and audio were outstanding.

Now, how about the Star Trek? To state my qualifications, I watched the very first Star Trek ""sneak preview"" episode in 1966. I was immediately hooked, and I doubt there is an episode I haven't seen 10 times or more over the years ... favorites like The Trouble with Tribbles more than that. So I've been a fan of every series and every movie now for closing in on 50 years.

As an original Star Trek fan, this movie hit the spot. There were numerous little tributes to the Original Series throughout this film. It was a treasure trove of nostalgia for folks like me who know that series from every angle. I'll be honest, when I first heard the rumor that Khan was coming back (AGAIN) I rolled my eyes. But they pulled it off, and fantastically. Were some of the plot resolutions telegraphed far in advance? Yes they were. However, I'd like to think that if they make a Star Trek film true to the spirit of TOS (TV and movies), and a fan is intimately familiar with TOS, it is very understandable that they could see some of these things coming.

And it literally doesn't matter if you do. There are plenty of surprises regardless.

Dialogue throughout the film is snappy and often laugh-out-loud funny in a good way. And once again the triangle of Kirk-Spock-McCoy provided most of the humor and sharp-witted lines. Some of them go by so quickly that you have to pay close attention to catch everything. It was delightful.

Even the closing credits are a treat, with a couple of touches certain to put a lump in the throats of long-time fans like me. Watch particularly for the way that Nimoy is credited, and the outstanding orchestral presentation of the original theme music. Fantastic.

You might guess that I find this film and this blu ray product to be:

Highly recommended.

5294782,3,B009934S5M,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 I'm happy to report that 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is superior to the ho-hum 2009 initial Reboot. Here you get two villains for the price of one; they manage to be much more fleshed out than the bald Romulan, Nero, in the 2009 film, an unlikeable sadist of a character, who viewers could never warm up to.

At least the two villains in 'Into Darkness', Starfleet's Admiral Marcus, and the genetically engineered superhuman, rogue Starfleet agent, John Harrison (aka 'Khan'), operate on the surface, with some sort of (albeit twisted), moral imperative. Marcus is sort of a futuristic Dick Cheney run amok, determined to provoke a war with the Klingons, who he fears will soon destroy the Federation. And Khan, who resorts to terrorism when he blows up a secret Starfleet installation in London, is actually trying to get back at Marcus, who has stashed 72 of his superhuman comrades inside photon torpedoes, which end up on the Enterprise.

After Kirk's mentor, Admiral Pike, is killed by Khan, in a direct attack on Starfleet headquarters in San Francisco, Marcus correctly calculates that the impulsive Kirk, will gladly follow his 'shoot to kill' orders, and take out Khan, who has fled to Chronos, the Klingon home world. Kirk's impulsivity is what makes him interesting. Don't ask me why it's necessary for Marcus to place the 72 'pod people' in the photon torpedoes, because after all, Kirk could eventually disobey his orders and they could be discovered, which could mean bad news for Marcus, back at Starfleet. But that's exactly what happens. So why didn't Marcus dispose of Khan's 72 buddies before he orders Kirk to go after Khan? Some internet posters have suggested that Marcus wants to 'stick it to' Khan after he becomes a turncoat. Khan will die with the knowledge that all members of his race will die with him, at the same moment.

If Kirk happens to have a little of 'Marcus' in him in his thirst for revenge, it's up to his 'United Nations' crew members, to become more 'balanced' and bring Kirk back into the fold, so he conforms to acceptable behavior, within the context of international (or shall we say, 'universal') law. 'Scotty' is first to sound the trumpet of 'lawful behavior', when he resigns his commission after he's banned from inspecting the torpedoes. And then Spock, Bones and Uhura, who today would make a great team on a Commission of Human Rights, convince Kirk to take Khan alive.

'Into Darkness' really picks up in terms of plot, when a series of reversals keep us guessing as what's going to happen next. Marcus attacks the Enterprise and disables it; Kirk offers to give up Khan and the 72 cryogenically frozen ones but before Marcus can kill everyone, Scotty infiltrates Marcus' unmarked Federation starship, the USS Vengeance, and causes a power outage; after Kirk and Khan do a 'space jump' to the Vengeance, Khan manages to kill Marcus and take over the ship. But Spock manages to beam the torpedoes onto the USS Vengeance, explode them, causing the ship to become incapacitated, just like the Enterprise.

There's a spectacular scene as Khan crashes the USS Vengeance into Starfleet Academy in San Francisco as well as his apprehension by Spock and Uhura (please rest assured that in the future, there are still cable cars operating in San Francisco!).

'Into Darkness' could have been a masterpiece except for the unfortunate fact that it is wholly derivative. Kids who are not familiar with earlier Trek movies, might not realize that when Kirk saves the ship by going into the radiation chamber and has an emotional farewell with Spock, that's almost a direct rip-off from Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan. Except in the earlier film, the roles are reversed: it's Spock who gets radiated, dies and saves the ship! I know this is supposed to be a tribute to Wrath of Khan, but tributes should not be direct copies. It's an example of LAZY Screen writing.

Examples of additional laziness abound in Reboot #2. Consider how easy it is that Kirk is revived when they discover Khan's blood has restorative properties. One unexplored implication is that many people on earth will now be resurrected from death, by simply tapping into the blood supply of the 72 pod people, once they are brought out of suspended animation.

There are plenty of more scenes that are copies from earlier Trek incarnations. Take for example, the opening scene, where the Prime Directive is violated. How many times did we see that before? Another group of indigenous peoples, being saved by the noble crew of the Enterprise. Or how about the 'machine gun' attack on Starfleet Headquarters or when Kirk and Khan, do the 'space jump'? You'll just have to ignore In Darkness' lack of originality, if you want to enjoy this film.

The story is also enhanced by how the screenwriters give the supporting players, their moment in the sun. I happen to favor Simon Pegg as the best actor in the film and enjoyed how he disabled the ship, in the proud tradition of the original Scotty, James Doohan. Bones is nicely utilized when he helps out arming the torpedoes and saves Kirk; Uhura helps Spock subdue Khan and Chekov has some nifty moments, below deck. Sulu also manages to get in the act by some death-defying piloting.

Spare me all the little petty arguments between Kirk and Spock as well as the aforementioned copycat radiation chamber scene. Nonetheless, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, are becoming much more comfortable as worthy precursors of Shatner and Nimoy.

Now that J.J. Abrams has improved his reboot, it's high time that he steps up his game and comes up with a truly original screenplay for the third installment. Keep the copycat stuff to a minimum. 'In Darkness' passes the test...barely.",1371686400,8,5767,4.854526958290946

I have been a Trekkie since I was a child watching the original series in the 70's. I've seen all the movies, all the original episodes, all the TNG episodes, and most of all the others, excepting ""Enterprise"" (but that's just because I really don't like Bakula!) I've been there through the best, and the worst (again, except for the Bakula stint). I was very nervous about the reboot four years ago... but upon seeing it, I was one of the ones who came away excited, not discouraged. I felt JJA et al did a magnificent job then, and I think they've done it again with ""Into Darkness"".

I have but one complaint about this one; it should have been a little longer. Benedict Cumberbatch was fantastic in his role... but in my opinion, he was under-utilized. He needed more lines, a couple more scenes where we get to know the man a little better. I think that would have assuaged many of the concerns that have been raised about the character he portrays.

Nevertheless, I loved the film. I feel like these movies (2009 & 2013) are on the right track for the most part, and neither have let me down like so many of their predecessors did. My only fear now is that the franchise will be handed off to someone else now that JJA has committed to a larger project with Disney. I hope that doesn't happen.

Two star, something you didn't like but not a complete waste of time.  A three star is worth seeing once and you will be ok with never seeing again.

5294793,5,B009934S5M,"One aspect of this film that demands more of a mention is something that has been sorely lacking in most of the Trek films through the years: Suspense. The original series had some truly suspenseful, nail biting moments that were unlike any suspense seen anywhere before. The Enterprise Incident, Obsession, Day Of The Dove and The Doomsday Machine all had moments of edge of your seat suspense and there were several others, but when it came to the films, something malfunctioned on the level of a major engineering blunder that would send Mr Scott into a tizzy: The suspense was largely gone. Seems impossible, given that with a film, there are MORE opportunities for intense suspense thanks to more time and better budgets which could lead to more elaborate plot points that could create tense situations, but alas, Star Trek got it wrong..... until now.

With Star Trek Into Darkness we are treated to more suspense than the total sum of all suspenseful moments from the entire Original Series. If you're NOT on the edge of your seat watching this movie, trekker, trekkie or not, you must be a cliff diver or live on rollercoasters.

Some of why the film is so suspenseful is the pacing itself. Abrams and his team barely allow you to recover from one suspenseful situation before the plot, which is excellent, hurls another one at you. That's not to say the film doesn't contain moments of heart and those humanistic elements Roddenberry built the franchise on, they are there, and in more abundance than has been recognized by other reviewers due to the pulse pounding action and incredible visual effects that will have you wanting to be a part of the Enterprise crew more than ever before.

Abrams does a marvelous job at PROPERLY recreating in the new altered timeline everything that made the original series such a terrific show and he manages to make it fresh and appealing to everyone even more so than the first of his forays into the Star Trek universe.

That there is a villain from a place you might not have seen coming (besides the villain that everyone has been muttering about, yes there are TWO villains in this film) that adds that topical touch of reflection of current headlines to the mix, another hallmark of much of the writing of the second and third seasons of the original series, is also a welcome plot point.

To sum it up, Abrams and his crew have a huge uphill battle to endure now that they have so perfectly put together the most satisfying Trek film ever created.

5294795,5,B009934S5M,"If you liked/loved the first JJ movie having something to do with ""Star Trek,"" then you're going to fall head over heels in love with this one.  The first JJ effort (Star Trek 2009, Star Trek 11 or whatever), did well at the box office, though perhaps not as much as JJ and Paramount INC liked, so yeah, warp speed and we get a sequel.

Considering how absolutely great the first JJ Star Trek flick was/is, I wondered before I saw a frame of this instant masterpiece, could JJ ever come even close to giving us a great sequel?  Well, the answer is yes, yes, and an extra yes!  All the regulars from the first JJ film are back, and more!  Yet, of course, one of the keys to the success and long-livety of the very first original Star Trek TV show, was in the writing.  The direction an afterthought (until JJ).  Here, JJ and crew live up to not only the almost sacredness of the original show, and the first few big screen flix and spinoff series, but go beyond that.

Fortunately, JJ Abrams has already proven his worth in ""Hollywood"" time and time again, as not only a man of great creativity and vision generally, but the guy who brought back the Star Trek franchise back to life.  Not that it was ever broken, but it had ""been"" a few years...

The first movie by JJ was just so perfect, imho, but this one ups the bet.  JJ and Paramount have wagered that those misguided souls who bought into the first film's wonderful cosmic vision of humankind's near future, might let down with the sequel.  But, judging from the box office and acceptance among ST drones, hope lives inside and outside this clearly five-star effort based upon characters created by Gene Roddenberry...

I will leave breakdowns of the various pro's and con's of this sequel to 2009's brilliant original to others for the meantime, but the first film was such a ground-breaking tribute to all that is good and decent in the Star Trek universe, (JJ's first, startrek 11, st2009, zzzzz), that this is just icing on the cake.  The first offered lens flares?  They are here, in spades.  Jittery and zoomiee phony director techniques?  JJ drenches us in them, praise the Lord.  And all our favorites are back.  Obnoxious Kirk, goofy Spock, interpretations of others, i.e., McCoy, Scotty, Uhuruh (Spock's ""lover"" oops spoiler alert), and good impressions of Sulu and Chekov.  All give oscar award consideration performances, and if JJ doesn't win best picture for this, then there just ain't no justice in the whole dang universe...

This is great cinema.  This is ""art.""  And while this review is based upon seeing just a few minutes of this, that was more than enough.  And I really, really, really mean that a few minutes of this is way more than enough, just like it was with JJ's original.  Extra DVD/Blu-Ray versions have tons of extra features and all go to make you just worship this JJ effort.  The JJ ""lens-flare"" discussion, is for gold.  As is the featurette, ""JJ and ST 2013: Further spoiling a worn-out franchise.""  There are other DVD/Blu-Ray features which JJ and Paramount have included, like ""JJ: What's this Star Trek all about?""  Extra stuff like this is included.  Much more than I can go into here.

Since the original JJ Abram's Star Trek first came out, there has been a somewhat muted debate of what JJ had actually done, with his ""rebooting"" of the ST brand.  Some have seen it as heaven-sent, some otherwise, but let me just end this by saying that, and I almost choke when I write this, Star Trek 2009 is absolutely nothing.  I mean, St2K9 is old news and nowhere as good as this first JJ sequel.  So, rush right out and see it or buy this product, to joyfully, blissfully, enjoy one of the greatest filmmaker's of all time, JJ Abrams, and his brilliant, much better than the original, artwork, called (appropriately), ""Star Trek: Into Darkness.""  The split second, but so totally filmic comfort food special effects shots, alone make this a must buy!

Hats off, lens flare off, steady-cam on, steady-cam off, lens flare on, 3d on and off and who cares, and two thumbs up for the obvious talent employed in the making of this, this ageless epic for all times.  This is, nuff said, the greatest motion picture of all times, and yay, JJ gets to bring similar glorious renewal to Star Wars,...

If our pal JJ does for Star Wars what he did for Star Trek, I can't wait!

JJ Abrams rules.  He just rules, that's all.  This is not a film, but a work of art.  Thank you JJ, thank you...

5294796,1,B009934S5M,"Just a thought here, but I for one am tired of seeing unreleased CD's and movies get a flood of bland and verbose reviews when no one, not one of these folks has seen the packaging, special features, or quality of the transfers.

Moreover, I am sick and tired of seeing the longest reviews, those with single line, line-by-line summaries of the tracks/episodes/chapters that take up half a page or more, more or less forcing people to click the ""yes"" button when asked ""Was this review helpful""?  These are reviews, not friggin post-modern novellas people!

So, just for fun, let's see how many people will see this, and like this, so we can send a message to Amazon to perhaps get them to:

1.  lockout product reviews until the product has actually shipped? And,
2.  limit the reviews to something reasonable.  Honestly, in the age of ADHD/zero-attention-span teens and 24/7 multitasking in the workplace if you can't do a serviceable product review in less than 1000 words, 1200 tops, your opinions probably don't matter.  Shakespeare famously quipped, ""brevity is the soul of wit"".  If so, then 90% of the reviewers on Amazon are self-defined half-wits by dint of their submissions.

This is not the final refuge for flunkies who fail to write the last great American novel.  People wanna know if it's good and worth the money.  End of story.

Thank you.

PS, because Amazon reviews must contain 20 words about the product, here it goes:

While I was skeptical of how they could possibly use Khan in this story, I think his backstory is credible enough to work. And then the filmmakers decided that they wanted to copy Wrath of Khan in the end. The reactor scene felt copied and unnecessary, and the ""yell"" is just painful. Once we push through that and get to Khan crashing the ship, things get a bit better.

Here is what I didn't like about the new one (I will skip all the massive holes and horrible story of the first movie), There is no back story between Kahn and Kirk so it takes away all the drama that was present in the original movie and one of the main reasons it was so great, in this version its just flat, he is just another villian kirk doesnt know at all. about 10 minutes solid of people just running. they changed the whole story around to kill kirk instead of spock which is fine to change the story around but he was back to life in less than 10 minutes and you knew how they were going to bring him back from about 1/3 of the way through the movie. I hate the whole spock uhura thing its stupid and now spock is crying its like he is just a regular crew member now and no different than all the humans. And also very important is that bones has become useless. They give him a couple lines of im a doctor not a such and such but he has no real role in the movie and there is no trio like in the original series where one was giving you logic and the other the emotion and then kirk had to blend them. There is also no moral story here, like the revenge theme in kahn, or the relocation theme of insurrection or even the environmental theme of the voyage home. This is just a Saturday matinee with lots of effects and little story. I hope now that JJ is going to go off and ruin star wars too im hoping the can get someone else who can write a movie with a decent plot.",1370908800,14,1828,3.9972677595628414

Spock looks TERRIBLE and well, let's face it... a bit chunky.  Sorry Zachary Quinto, you definitely should have worked out for this second flick.  I don't ever remember Spock being overweight.

  The action in this movie is some of the best I have ever seen.  I put this in the top five up there with Avatar.  Though we all know that Avatar cannot and will NOT EVER be beaten, unless it's by it's own sequel.  :-)

  I am not real big into going into huge detail.  The colors were amazing, I felt like I was actually there in almost every scene, which tells you a little bit about how great the graphics are.  I was pretty disappointed in the lack of story towards the end of the movie... however, that will not keep me from watching this movie over 100 times.

5294801,5,B009934S5M,"[Review is for the Theatrical Version -- in IMAX!]

** Some Spoilers **

Into Darkness is an excellent follow-up to the 2009 film, Star Trek.

The alternate history that J.J. Abrams writes still has a lot of the borrowed items from the original TV and movies to make the film interesting to fans, yet for those not into the ""canon,"" the film stands on its own as an interesting science fiction film.

** Spoilers **

As you may have heard by now, the Botany Bay was discovered earlier than in the original time-line and someone who knows better wants to militarize the Federation and wants to use Khan for that purpose.  Let's get a man who knows how a military mind works and use him to handle the Klingon threat.

Quite a story!

** End Spoilers **

Relationships:

The film is very character-driven.  Now this may seem at odds to you if you enjoy a film full of special effects and warp-speed ships.  Even so Kirk is the same brash self who will break the rules if it means saving a life.

The film starts out with Kirk swiping a holy scroll from natives - white, wild natives with eyes that blink backwards  -- weird, but I digress.  And somehow we have his science officer about to blow a cold fusion bomb into a volcano and save the planet.  Yeow!  And the Enterprise having the ability to land on the surface of a planet was a new look as well.

Some fans squawk about Spock having a relationship with Uhura. First, it's not that unheard of.  Remember in the original series with Apollo?  And second, it's done in a tasteful manner and really could have been cut out altogether!

The primary relationship of course is the Kirk/Spock dynamic.  As in the original series, Kirk, Spock and at times McCoy really go at it.  Would have liked this to have been better scripted with more banter and some humor injected here.

The other relation is between Khan (played coolly by Cumberbatch) and the Federation - playing on others emotions, playing them to get what he wants - fascinating character.  As Kirk, he cares about his crew - frozen and awaiting revival - and besides wanting revenge on the Federation, he wants Kirk - very dead!

Cons:  Scotty in this film is a riot of a Scotman - but Chekov not so much.  Not all characters come off well.  Would have liked to have seen some more romance with the Carol Marcus character.  Ah, well.

Special Effects:  See the film on the big IMAX screen.  The cost is prohibitive but the effects are well worth it.  The chase through a pink/purple Peter Maxx-like jungle, the new ""warp speed"" and the speed chasing with Klingon space cruisers is worth the price.

Make-Up!:  The Klingons, must mention the Klingons.  They make a brief and exciting entrance half-way through the film as they confront a powerless shuttle containing Kirk and a few hand-picked men - who smartly took off their red shirts, LOL - and as in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the view of Klingons have again changed.

Music!:  The score is excellently done - the mix throughout was amazing and fit each scene well.  Alexander Courage's score is inserted where appropriate.  Stay for the end credits and listen to the coda.  Awesome stuff.

Bottom Line:  A must-see especially for ""Wrath of Khan"" fans.  You'll see many similarities to an interesting story that will keep you on the edge throughout.

5294802,1,B009934S5M,"First let me say that before you read my review, that I will present a few spoilers so if you don't want to know what happens in the film, please skip my review.  Having said that I would like to also mention that I have been a fan of Star Trek, Star Trek The Animated Series, Star Trek The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, Enterprise and even the comics while growing up. Being that I am of the first generation of fans who grew up watching TOS of Star Trek when it was in re-runs(I grew up in the 80's and 90's), I developed a strong sense as to what Star Trek is and as to why I have enjoyed it so much.  As such,  I would like to say that because I have enjoyed Star Trek in all its various incarnations that I am strongly against the work of what JJ Abrams has done with the franchise.

As a fan, and even as a consumer, we all have an understanding of what brands are and the differences between brands.  For example, most consumers can tell the difference between drinking a glass of Coca Cola to drinking a glass of Pepsi. Or even the difference between eating a turkey Hungry Man TV Dinner and the taste of one's mother's Thanksgiving Turkey dinner.  As human beings, we all develop a strong sense of what is palatable and the difference between what we do not like and why we do not like something; as well as what our expectations are for things such as food, and for the purposes of this review, films.

Well while watching JJ Abram's Star Trek Into Darkness, I can truly say that it left an awful taste in my mouth and it left my Star Trek palette extremely confused. Was I watching his future attempt to direct the next franchise of Star Wars films? Or was I watching a space movie that simply had the Star Trek name attached to it?

I came to the conclusion that both answers were correct because when it comes down to it, the core of this movie is not Star Trek. For example the actor who plays Scotty seems to be doing a bad parody of James Doohan, the same goes for the actor who plays Spock, they seemed to be acting as not characters, but instead playing caricatures.  This is especially played out with Dr. McCoy's character, as he is essentially relegated to continuously tell us that ""He's a doctor not a (fill in the blank)"" caricature.

The cast, the reboot, the story, it doesn't work and that is for several reasons.

Why? For that I need to refer back to the writing as viewed in the original series.  Star Trek The Original Series at its core was not simply a recyclable tale of good vs. evil.  Gene Roddenberry wrote Star Trek as being very Shakespearean.  This doesn't mean that you have to be familiar with the works of William Shakespeare to enjoy Star Trek, but instead it means that Roddenberry used several stylistic elements borrowed from Shakespeare which translated into great science fiction drama that had a good mix of action, drama, romance, and most important, storyline.

After The Original Series Ended and Star Trek The Next Generation, as well as DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise were broadcast, the writers of each of the Star Trek television shows continued writing Star Trek episodes in the same style of Roddenberry in order to match and be consistent with what Roddenberry wanted Star Trek to be.  This is what I have enjoyed most as a fan of Star Trek was that I could watch any of the shows and any of the movies(excluding JJ Abrams) and the style of the writing would essentially be within what Gene Roddenberry intended Star Trek to be.  Granted many Trek fans have differing opinions on the quality of the various writers of each of The Next Generation era series, I don't think that any Star Trek fan could say in good conscience that any of those writers attempted to remake Star Trek into something it wasn't (i.e. Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica).

However JJ Abrams felt that he needed to remake Star Trek for ""a whole new generation"" whatever that means.  As a fan, I can honestly say that he has not remade anything instead he has copied the soul of Star Wars Episode I into each of his Star Trek Films.  In which case, I cannot understand how any true Star Trek Fan can enjoy Star Trek Into Darkness.  I came away watching the film feeling that the best parts of the film were the brief appearance by Leonard Nimoy and the original Star Trek music which is played at the very end of the film.

ST Into Darkness had strong George Lucas feel to it in the beginning and then the movie began to deteriorate as it seemed as though the writers struggled to write all of the dialog as the dialog that is in the film seems rushed and felt as though it had no place.

I was especially disappointed on the portrayal of Khan.  The original Khan from both Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan and his introduction in the TOS episode ""Space Seed"" showed us a very intelligent, calculated individual who came from a time when genetically engineered supermen fought to control Earth and did not appear until he was found by TOS Enterprise crew(go watch the TOS episode Space Seed if you don't know what I am referring to). Abram's portrayal of Khan tells us nothing of his origins(other than a few dimwitted explanations) and essentially portrays Khan as The Terminator.  I didn't like that because I felt it dumbs down the character.

Another thing that I didn't like was the whole Spock-Uhura relationship.  When it comes down to it, it just doesn't work.  Uhura's character played by Nichelle Nichols, was that of a bright young woman whose role wasn't that of just someone who was played by a person of color, but whose role was essentially to the crew.  However JJ Abrams has also dumbed down Uhura to be that of a whiny, moody woman who is angry with her boyfriend(Spock).  That's just poor writing and a misuse of a vital Star Trek Character.

Also, I had a problem with the character of Dr. Carol Marcus.  While I admit, JJ Abrams had more leeway with this character because this character doesn't appear until Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan so I can't fault Abrams for ruining her character too much.  However I felt that the scene where she changes clothes on Mud's Ship was completely unnecessary and did not add any sense of sexiness to the film.  Female Star Trek fans should especially take note of this because obviously the message that JJ Abrams was sending was that Star Trek can't have female characters without making them into sex objects in order to keep the interest of the audience. That particular scene made absolutely no sense whatsoever, again this is due to poor writing and poor directing.

Other than the brief appearance of the real Spock and the original music played at the end of the film, I cannot say that this film has any redeeming or entertaining qualities whatsoever. So to the real Star Trek fans out there, don't waste your time or your money.  If you feel any interest at all in watching ST Into Darkness, wait until you can watch it on cable/satellite or for when it is shown on broadcast TV for free.

Finally, I would like to say that I sincerely hope that this is the last Star Trek film directed by JJ Abrams.  In addition, I have completely lost faith in Paramount and I hope that one day they will sell the film rights to Disney. Paramount seemed to think that Star Trek needed to be ""rebooted"" just like many movie companies feel that other classic movies need to be rebooted(Conan, Clash of the Titans, etc.).  What they don't realize is that classic movies are classic for a reason, that's because they are better.  Making Star Trek into an action shoot em up kind of movie doesn't work because it turns Star Trek into Star Wars, and no disrespect to Star Wars or fans of Star Wars, but the reality is that those two sci fi genres' is that they are completely separate types of science fiction and they should remain separate.

That is not to say that Kirk and Spock shouldn't be played again by different actors, I have no problem with that, but stick to what Star Trek is and with Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future and storytelling style. JJ Abrams has completely deviated from this vision and as such, his ST films should be avoided.
****************************************************************************************************************************************************

Update: 9/13/13

I wanted to share these quotes from both LeVar Burton and William Shatner about JJ Abram's ""reboots.""  They essentially have the same problem with JJ Abram's ""star trek"" that I do.

""At the end of the movie, I really care about what happens to the characters ... but I'm pretty much missing Gene Roddenberry in J.J.'s interpretation ... and at the end of the day, that's just not OK for me. "" - LeVar Burton

""The Star Treks we were in told a more personal story. Told a story that had more soul to it"" -William Shatner

Also as of today, I read on several movie related news websites that JJ Abrams has confirmed that he will in fact not direct the next Star Trek film.  Hopefully between now and the next film, Paramount will do the right thing and leave the alternate star trek universe where it belongs, in the the garbage. I hope that Paramount will return Star Trek to original universe and timeline continuing the story with a whole new cast of characters instead of producing cheap star trek parody films that have been forced upon us by JJ and crew.  Good bye JJ Abrams and good riddance!",1370822400,35,9415,4.565656565656566

Kirk disobeys orders, creating a rift with Spock, who cannot lie on an official report. I was surprised at how funny this movie was. The writers included some very clever lines, and that is always a plus in a film with this much action and intensity. Into Darkness does not necessarily stand out as a superior entry in the genre, but the exciting, big-budget, visually stimulating film certainly is good enough to warrant a day at the movies.",1370822400,3,573,4.466666666666667

5294805,5,B009934S5M,"I didn't read any of the positive reviews, only the 26 one star reviews that are present here as of this writing.  I did read your reviews guys and I've got to say I just plain disagree.  I'm a true die-hard Original Series fan.  I grew up watching Captain Kirk with my dad and frankly TOS feels like an extended family to me.  Now, I don't go to conventions, but I've watched all the Star Trek series and have seen every movie in the theater.  In my opinion I believe that the JJ Abrams movies are far superior to all of the movies that preceded his first and now second movie (into darkness).

At first I was horrified about the alternate universe and was frankly rather upset over it for a full day.  JJ just screwed with 40+ years of Star Trek canon, how dare he!!!!  After calming down, I started thinking about it and realized it opened all sorts of doors to him that were closed before, which allowed him to tell new and fun stories.  He was no longer stuck in a stagnant universe.  The really cool part for him, is he gets to benefit from that 40+ years of people knowing what a ""Red Alert"" or ""Photon Torpedoes"" are without having to go techie on the audience.  I think it's safe to say, those phrases are well known to the general public, trekkie or not.

IMO, this is a movie that anyone can enjoy regardless if they've ever seen Star Trek in any form.  Pretending for a moment that these were the first two Star Trek movies ever made, I can't help but wonder if the negative reviews would go away.  I think these movies stand on their own very well.  The acting, cinematography, storyline, action and effects are all very compelling.

If I ever were to meet Mr. Abrams, I would tell him job well done, keep up the good work.

Into Darkness (ST: ID) left me and my wife (not a trek fan) feeling like we got our monies worth and then some and frankly, it's been awhile since a movie has done that for us.  We didn't walk away feeling jipped or like there should've been more.  The overall experience was very satisfying and I've pre-ordered the Blu-Ray.  Now, if Paramount will stop jipping us when it comes to the releases, I'll be pleasantly surprised.  Come on Paramount, stop re-releasing the 8th version of the extra extended, super wazoo, ultra-cool, gotta have it or you're a looser edition.  Just give us what we want the first time around.

That said, my spouse and I have seen all the Star Trek TV series and movies--along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galaxy-Quest/dp/B001MM28JG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galaxy Quest</a>, the very funny sendup of both Star Trek and its cast and its most avid fans. We've also seen all the Star Wars movies. And TV series like FarScape, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Continuum, Lexx (the most un-Star Trekish of all TV scifi series), Game of Thrones, Vikings, everything Joss Whedon has ever helmed...so we are big fans of scifi/fantasy stuff.

My spouse & I saw Star Trek/Into Darkness last night at the local cineplex in 2D from ideal seats. And both as Star Trek fans (though not superfans) and as movie buffs, we were underwhelmed. Wasn't bad, wasn't great, wasn't memorable.

A fair comparison would be with Joss Whedon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marvel-s-The-Avengers/dp/B008NCSZQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marvel's The Avengers</a>. Avengers delivered all the popcorn thrills & chills that STID does, but with much more memorable characters, screenwriting, mise en scene, AND without stealing most of its ideas from other movies.

In a way you'd be best off seeing STID if you hadn't seen any Star Trek movies or TV episodes, because this is big budget fan fiction, full of references, characters, and even plotlines from other movies--mostly Star Trek, but at least one action sequence from Star Wars. I'm not griping about Kirk/Spock/Uhuru/Scotty/Doc being there. I'm griping about the movie rehashing old Star Trek shows instead of giving us something new and worthy of a series reboot.

On the plus side, we get Benedict Cumberbatch, the imposing Brit who stars in BBC's modern day retelling of Sherlock Holmes. When he's onscreen the other characters become kind of transparent (metaphorically speaking). And STID's casting is OK. Chris Pine's Cap'n Kirk certainly inhabits the uniform with the same bravado (and less hamminess) than his predecessor. Good Spock. Zoe Saldana's Lt. Uhuru is an improvement on the original. Less successful were Doc and Scotty.

But the real problem is that experienced Trek viewers have seen this movie before, one way or another. In a country with 310 million people, surely one can cook up an original Star Trek screenplay. Whedon took just as heavy a load of backstory and made an original movie out of it. Abrams has not.

I don't understand why this doesn't bother the Trekkies writing reviews here more than it did. The last straw was weaving the original Star Trek TV show thems music into the thunderous but unmemorable orchestral score for this one, during the closing credits. It was jarringly mismatched to the contemporization of this movie.

Unlike others here, I preferred the first Star Trek series reboot movie with the same main characters. It seemed less derivative and more fresh start-y.

But regardless of whether my spouse and I liked it, should YOU get the DVD and see it?

As I said, if you're a Trekkie completest that's a no-brainer.

If you're a Trekkie-light kinda person like my spouse and me (saw all the previous Trek stuff but don't go to conventions and don't live & breathe it), prrrrobably yes. Just don't get your expectations up too high.

And surprisingly, I think it'll work better on a TV screen than in the theater. I realize this is counterintuitive when it comes to big budget action movies. But JJ Abrams shot it for the TV screen: seems like half the film is count-the-pores extreme close-ups of people's faces. This is fine on a TV screen, which supports close and medium-distance shots best. In the theater--even from our ideal seats--it was sort of invasive. If you're planning on seeing it in a theater, I'd recommend sitting towards the back, contrary to where I'd sit for a movie really designed for the theater.

My favorite scene in Avengers was where Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is talking to Loki when they have him imprisoned. He doesn't realize she's actually interrogating him to find out what he knows that they need to know. The scene is subtle and rests on Johansson's low-keyed but considerable acting talent. I mention this because there's nothing like this in STID. STID puts everything in bright primary colors. Apparently they didn't have a big enough budget for subtlety.

Another recent big-budget sci-fi blockbuster,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar/dp/B003EVWDR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar</a>, was not a film my spouse and I carry around in our hearts like we do truly great movies, but overall it was considerably better than Star Trek Into Darkness. More original screenplay, more interesting visuals, more engaging storyline. Except for Benedict Cumberbatch and his character. He was more memorable than his counterpart in Avatar, I admit. He was also more memorable than his counterpart in Avengers. He really has a compelling presence.

Note that I'm not comparing Star Trek Into Darkness with, say, Let Me In, the wonderful American remake of the similarly named Swedish vampire movie, starring an amazing 12 year old Chloe Grace Moretz. Or with the True Grit remake. You could say both those films have different audiences.

But this film's audience--outside diehard Trekkies--is the same as for Avengers and Avatar and other blockbusters that aren't scifi even. Against them, and outside any commitment you might have to the Star Trek franchise, this is just an OK movie. I don't think the cast is to blame for this. It's the director, who just isn't as good a movie director as Cameron or Whedon.

I have more specific complaints but I promised a no-spoilers review, so those must wait. One hint though: Benedict Cumberbatch's character's name doesn't fit him at all. Seems like a minor point, but get enough of them and they start to add up to breaking the fourth wall. At least all the characters play it straight--no nudge nudge wink wink moments in the film. That would have been the kiss of death.

5294808,3,B009934S5M,"My first introduction to the world of Star Trek was not the original series but the second television show, Star Trek: The Next Generation.  I may have seen reruns of the original series before I sat down with my family to watch the pilot episode of TNG, but if so it has been lost to memory.  I do remember watching reruns of TOS after familiarizing myself with TNG and trying to wrap my head around the fact that these two shows were supposed to comprise the same fictional universe.  As I got older, I eventually came to understand the shared philosophy between each iteration of Star Trek: a secular humanist view of the future.  Star Trek exists in a world where the limitless optimism of the 1960s never died.  I continued watching Star Trek shows and movies for years after my first introduction, but eventually I bailed sometime in the middle of Voyager's run (my zeal for Star Trek had its limits).  Still, the first three television shows found a unique way of exploring and commenting on creator Gene Roddenberry's image of the future: TOS presented us with the dangers and surprises of exploration; TNG constructed a lived in image of different worlds attempting to share what sometimes seemed like a small galaxy; and DS9, freed from Roddenberry's creative vision, actually started to question some of the mid-century zeal for the future that characterized the first two shows.

I started this review with this brief sketch of my relationship to Star Trek because no one goes into a long running series like this unencumbered.  Even those who have never seen an episode of any of the many series have an image (right or wrong) of what Star Trek stands for.  But you should know that I have an emotional, intellectual, and personal connection to the franchise, and this of course colors how I watched this movie.  When J.J. Abrams first decided to reboot the series, I wasn't sure what to think.  I was cautiously optimistic that he would be able to capture some of the fun of the original, but I in no way expected him to mimic the same pop-philosophy that had always characterized the series and made its way, in abbreviated form, into the movies.  (I can't imagine that Abrams is much of a Herman Melville fan, for instance).  Keeping my expectations in check helped me to really enjoy 2008's Star Trek.  Abrams transformed the movie into a series of sometimes enjoyable, sometimes dumb, and sometimes exhausting action set pieces, but he also managed to capture the relationship between the principal characters surprisingly well.

But where Star Trek had the benefit of low expectations, Star Trek into Darkness had the burden of showing where Abrams could take this series and the anticipatory build up of five years, a long time in-between movies.  While it's no unmitigated disaster, Star Trek into Darkness is a mixed bag.  It suffers from the usual problems that plague J.J. Abrams work, like the fact that it works when the gears are moving and the audience has little time to reflect on what's happening, but it starts to flail when things turn serious.

Typical of a J.J. Abrams joint, STiD begins in media res, with Kirk and McCoy fleeing a group of natives after stealing a religious artifact.  They hope to lure the island community, a burgeoning society of sentient beings, away from an active volcano long enough so that Spock can set a cold fusion bomb that will deactivate the volcano, allowing the natives to live long enough to enter the Bronze Age.  Kirk soon has to decide whether he should leave Spock to die in the volcano or if he should reveal the Enterprise to the natives and beam Spock out of danger.  Obviously, Kirk decides on the latter, and in doing so he breaks the Prime Directive, a central tenant of Starfleet that says explorers should not interfere with the development of alien civilizations.  Kirk leaves all of this out of his official report, but Spock doesn't, which leads to Kirk's mentor and senior officer, Captain Pike, dressing him down and relieving him of command of the Enterprise.

Shortly after Pike has taken command of the Enterprise, a mysterious terrorist played by Benedict Cumberbatch blows up a building used by Starfleet and later attacks a meeting of senior Starfleet officers who have convened to decide how best to tackle this act of terrorism.  In the attack, Pike is killed, sending Kirk into revenge mode.  It's discovered that the terrorist, John Harrison, has fled to the Klingon home world, a warrior race that is on the brink of war with the Federation. So Captain Marcus, played by Robocop himself, Peter Weller, tasks Kirk and the enterprise with tracking Harrison's location and killing him with a long range torpedo.

The clear modern analogy is drone strikes, a policy where we often ignore the sovereign space of other nations in order assassinate individuals suspected of terrorism, even if they are also American citizens.  The crew of the Enterprise is naturally uncomfortable with the idea of assassinating a Federation citizen without a trial.  Spock makes his disagreement with the assignment clear and Scotty goes so far as to stay behind rather than to be implicated in the assassination.

It's obvious that this plot is attempting to address criticism that Abrams's Star Trek is just dumb fun without any of the original show's notions of philosophy. The use of science fiction to comment on contemporary politics was integral to what made the original series so memorable.  Gene Roddenberry wanted to do more than entertain; he wanted comment on the civil rights movements of the 60s.  In the end, Kirk decides to push aside his desire for revenge and captures Harrison.  I have to commend Abrams and his screenwriters for not only addressing moral quandaries surrounding terrorism, but also for clearly coming down against drone strikes.  It's common for large blockbusters to throw in an allusion to terrorism now and then to give themselves an easy sense of gravitas, but for every film that handles the issue with intelligence (Batman Begins), there are many more films that drop the ball (The Dark Knight Rises).  In fact, I would argue that STiD is better at handling the themes of terrorism, revenge, and justice than more overtly ""real world"" movies like Zero Dark Thirty.  And while we will never know for certain, the film's condemnation of assassinating our enemies would have been embraced by Roddenberry himself, who always came off as a bit of 60s radical.

It's too bad, then, that the moment Kirk captures the terrorist, Harrison, the movie begins to fall apart. Fair warning: from here on out there are heavy spoilers.  I avoided all spoilers before seeing the film, but I had heard the internet whisperings that Cumberbatch would be playing Kahn, the most notorious Star Trek villain.  Well, he is Kahn.  How a Mexican pretending to be Indian in the original Star Trek universe becomes a Brit in this universe, I'll never know (perhaps they'll explain this discrepancy in the sequel).  Perhaps one of the most potentially exciting aspects of the first Star Trek was that Abrams and company had come up with a way of starting fresh without completely overwriting the long history of the series.  All they had to do was construct an entirely new parallel universe.  But it seems wrong headed for Abram to give himself all of this freedom, to tell the audience that we are now entering a world where anything can happen--we are not bound to continuity; this is my playground now--and then go ahead and retread characters and events from the old universe.  There are so many possibilities in the world of Star Trek. Why give us more of the same?

But wait, it gets worse.  Perhaps the most inexplicable moment in the entire film is a restaging of a famous scene from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, but this time the characters are flipped.  Fans of the Star Trek series will almost immediately guess what scene I'm referring to: the death of Spock.  But here it is Kirk who sacrifices his life and restores power to the Enterprise.  At best, this comes across as mistaken fan service, cosplay on the big screen.  Abrams understands, rightly, that the death of Spock still has a strong emotional pull for geekdom.  So he thinks that restaging it will conjure up the same sort of emotional memories.  Instead, the scene plays out as rote.  I felt like I had to endure the death of Kirk in order for the real film to resume.  At its worst, this scene plays out as cynical miscalculation.  Abrams, unable to conjure up something new, tosses out pre-masticated remains for the public.  In my review of Super 8 (a film that has some fine moments), I said that Abrams was like a piano prodigy who can recreate the notes of a piece of music perfectly, but somehow the results are devoid of emotion.  I can think of no finer example of this than STiD's death of Kirk.

I don't think Abrams understands what a disservice the death of Kirk did not only to his audience, but also to himself.  Star Trek II is such a taught, well crafted piece of entertainment that to intentionally draw comparisons between it and STiD causes the latter to suffer.  But it also shows how little Abrams understood what made the death of Spock work.  Star Trek II smartly drew on the fact that the characters were getting older for dramatic weight.  Early in the film, McCoy gives Kirk his birthday presents, including a pair of archaic looking spectacles.  Death is becoming real to these characters.  Sure, there's element of survivor's guilt--that these characters have survived trouncing through the galaxy while others haven't.  But it's also the sense that age and death catches up with us all.  This dread hangs over much of the film.  But STiD takes place when Kirk and Spock are just beginning to understand each other.  They don't have the same history, and as young men death is not yet real to them.  In order to understand this, a director has to know not only how to stage action, which Abrams does well, but he must also know how to weave thematic weight into his narrative, which Abrams has yet to learn.

But despite my rant, the movie is rather enjoyable until about two-thirds of the way through.  It's not a complete loss.  The greatest boon this new series of movies has going for it are the actors.  Abrams must get credit for assembling a great group of young actors who manage to fit their roles well.  This is especially surprising, because the single greatest aspect of the original Star Trek was the relationship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.  It was easy to ignore the chintzy 1960s special effects when these three characters and the actors who portrayed them were on the screen.  (I still wish that Karl Urban could get more screen time as McCoy in the new series).  I sincerely hope that this crew has plenty of adventures left, and I think that one day Abrams might even become a great director of blockbuster entertainments.  Until then, I'm happy for someone else to take over for the next installment.",1370736000,9,11025,4.774789029535865

Perhaps they should have taken a shortcut through the center of the universe.

All this aside I must say that the second installment had me completely engaged and refreshingly I had no idea what was around the next corner. The movie in my opinion was absolutely brilliant with so much to offer both Trek fans and non fans both.  The respect for story continuity and Trek lore is very evident and the crew work so well together it's amazing to watch something so well orchestrated. Of course my favorite scenes are those of the bridge and the Enterprise herself which this movie does so well in illustrating just how versatile and multipurpose the ship is, taking away some limitations that the older movies seem to impose on her.

A lot of negative reviews are posted here. The general theme of these reviews is a long and drawn out rant about how Roddenberry kept true to the science and developed his stories better.

What a load of crap. I will admit in the first reboot, the Red Matter was pretty far-fetched. That's about it. Abrams more than makes up for it in this ""rehash"" of Wrath of Khan. Just like the original, there is a death. This time it's Kirk instead of Spock. Same scenario... radiation exposure, saying ""I love you man!"" through the glass, etc. Much better acting this time around. We all loved Shatner and we all agree he cant act, so I think it's time to quit doggin on Pine. At least he has some sort of acting skill.

The problem people have is using Khan's superhuman blood to resurrect Kirk. Why not? They're both human after all. Obviously wouldn't work on a Vulcan in the original, but in this version, it's plausible from a scientific standpoint. Rewind 30 years back and how did Roddenberry resurrect Spock? Oh yeah, it was Genesis... the magical torpedo that terraforms an uninhabitable rock (planetoid) that is not located within the habitable zone of any nearby star. If it was it would not have been devoid of any atmosphere. That is an astrophysical fact. Period. Roddenberry took a giant dump on astrophysics in the original and Abrams spun the story slightly in order to make it scientifically plausible.

So you folks, who are compelled to debate the science in these films, better come to the table armed with some actual knowledge. For every unbelievable aspect you try to point out in this new version, I will cite 5 examples from the Roddenberry era. It's time to give Abrams some credit and quit berating his work simply because you cant separate yourselves from the Roddenberry era for just two hours so you can enjoy an entertaining film.

I've enjoyed all of the Star Trek films. I never could get into TOS, but the later series were pretty good. And yes, despite Genesis, I enjoyed The Wrath of Khan. Just don't try to come at me with scientific appraisals of the original films. It won't hold water.",1370736000,8,2132,4.659574468085107

There's something I really enjoy about JJ Abrams style of filmmaking. Yes, its flashy and fast and it may come off as a bit shallow, but there's something about it that gives off a spark that really gets me engaged. He can get establish a lot within the first 15 to 30 minutes of a movie, which would take most filmmakers quite a while to build up. Everything from the big action scenes, to the core characters and their motivations to what they do - He knows exactly what he's doing behind the camera.

A prime example of this would be when he did Super 8. Within a half hour, we know just about the entire cast, what the kids are doing in the movie, the big awesome train crash that was so publicized happens and it happens at full force and it never feels like its overstuffing its self.

Which brings us to his take on the much loved Star Trek franchise. These films of his really cause some weird reactions with people. They make nice amounts of money and get excellent reviews from critics, but if you went to a random forum on the cesspit that is the internet, you'd probably find the opposite reaction. Almost like as if Abrams and co. spat in the face of everyone's mother and other relatives.

Personally, I actually really liked - hell, maybe even loved - his reboot of the Trek franchise. Great visuals, excellent chemistry, fun dialogue, fast paced, awesome music - It did a lot of things right, even if the plot was a bit confusing, with the alternate universes, black holes and what not.

Something that puzzles the hell out of me is why did the sequel, Into Darkness, take so long? I know Abrams was busy with Super 8 but maybe he should have put that off (as much as I love that film) in favor of doing this. It probably would be doing better business at the box office and critics than it is doing now.

Now, in the event you are wondering if I'm attacking the film or am going to spew out negative thoughts on the film, let's get this out of the way:

I'm not.

While Into Darkness certainly has its problems, and we'll get to those latter, its a worthy sequel to the original and one of the most entertaining things I've seen this year. It still has all the elements I loved from the original with a few new things thrown in.

Set a few years after the original, the Federation has come under attack from a terrorist by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), a former Starfleet officer out for revenge after he felt that Star command screwed him over in the worst ways possible. The crew of the Enterprise, led of course by Kirk n' Spock (Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, respectively), are sent in to take him down by orders of one Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller). But while the plot may seem simple, things are not as they seem.

I feel the need to get the bad stuff out of the way first, like in the same way a bratty child is forced to eat his vegetables before he can get to the good stuff. One of my main complaints of the film is that I feel it goes on for far too long. While Abrams's previous films have sported great pacing, Into Darkness kind of mess up a bit. There's filler in the movie that could have been seriously cut out and it would have been all the better for it, like bits where good ol Scotty (Simon Pegg) gets drunk off his ass or the bar scene between Kirk and Commander Pike (Bruce Greenwood and yes, I know its done to show their Father-Son-like relationship but it came off as forced).

Another thing that film does that bothers me is that it suffers from being unpredictable to predictable. There's some twists that caught me off guard but there's some stuff that can be seen a mile away. I think it may have to do with the fact that it had 3 screenwriters doing it, the first two being the scribes from the previous film Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman while the third scribe was divisive Prometheus and Lost writer Damon Lindelof. I always get this weird feeling like whenever Mr. Linelof is involved, the product always ends up spawning weird reactions with people. Eh, moving on.

As for the good stuff for the film, a lot of the things that made the first film great are still here. The visual effects and set design are better than ever, ranging from seeing things like an incredible fight in hyper-space in which we see all sorts of people flying out of the hull as things explode left and right, to the now famous scene in the trailers and advertisements where we see a Starfleet cruiser crash into a sprawling metropolis. Michael Giacchino's score is still nothing short of incredible, bringing out some true excitement and wonderment to the universe and some of the music is bound to get stuck in your head after its all over.

The performances across the board are quite good as well. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto continue to show they have their characters down pat and never ceases to stop being amusing from watching them be bros one moment to bickering about the rules and personal approaches to how the current mission on hand should be accomplished. Or how Karl Urban, who will always be Judge Dredd in my mind from now on thanks to to the excellent 2012 adaptation, continues to be the best replacement for Bones McCoy, with his quips and grumpy attitude.

While some have had problems with the character of Dr. Carol Marcus, a doctor who pops up on the Enterprise under a different name (Don't worry: No spoilers), and her actress Alice Eve, I never really had a problem with her. I thought she did well with the material that was given to her, especially her scenes between her and Bones.

But special mention must go to Benedict Cumberbatch as Harrison. Charismatic, intimidating, fierce and methodical are just the few words to describe his villain. One moment, you can go from being fascinated and even wanting to see him defeated, to feeling incredibly sorry for the guy. Quite a performance here. He's a true threat and makes the villain of the previous film, Nero (Eric Bana), look like a chump. No disrespect to Mr. Bana, who played a very fun and dangerous villain, but you look like old stuff compared to Cumberbatch. Kinda funny how the guy who has a ship with the ability to create black holes looks less threatening than one man with superpowers.

One might ask me: ""Is Into Darkness better than the original?"" I cannot say no, as due to the problems I've mentioned here that were not or at least weren't as big in the 2009 reboot. Star Trek 2009 was incredibly fresh at the time and sadly, with this, some, if only a little of the polish has come off. But that's only minor. Both films are pretty much on the same plane, with Darkness coming up just a tad short.

Into Darkness is bound to piss people off, as with most ""sacred"" works in nerdom, like whatever Joss Whedon pumps out or live action adaptations of Anime (which always almost suck). But even with the problems that the film has, there's still a lot to like here. If you can get past the pacing issues and the predictability of the film, you're in for one fun summer movie.

Now that all that is said and done, two questions remain: How will Abrams take on Star Wars turn out and what will Paramount do with the next film in the Trek franchise? I've got high hopes for his take on SW, but I'm not sure what to think the next Trek film will turn out.

While there are many things going right for this movie (it looks beautiful) I still can't get past the feeling I had 3/4 of the way through it as the (SPOILER) Enterprise is falling toward Earth in what should have been the most intense part of the movie...I was bored, so bored that as the ship was falling to Earth I actually thought that this would be a good time to run the credits over the scene. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that this scene seemed to tacked on (like many other scenes) that its hard to imagine they actually did it. Or maybe it had something to do with the fact that I didn't care if the ship did crash, killing everyone on board.

The first part of the movie was smart. The plot and the character development seemed headed in an interesting direction. But ultimately, it fizzled. And so to make up for it, they throw in some really unnecessary scenes to create the tension that the main story arch should have provided.

I dunno....after watching both movies, I really think they should refocus their energy into doing a TV series....that is where Star Trek has always shined. That is where Star Trek was always the most interesting. A medium where they can create more substance....and fewer explosions. Action scenes and explosions were never what Star Trek was about.

5294818,4,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)

As a long-time Trekker, I don't have the many problems with the new incarnation that some do. I like this new cast, and the films are undeniably entertaining, even if it isn't exactly the Star Trek I used to know and love. Philosophy, ethical debates and the merits of intelligence have largely gone out the window in favor of slam-bang action and cowboy heroics. Still, the original Star Trek always contained some of the latter, so it isn't as jarring a change as it would be if, say Picard and crew starting indiscriminately kicking @$$ and taking names.

Star Trek Into Darkness picks up a year (four years in real time) after the events of the first reboot, in which young Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and the Enterprise crew managed to save Earth from vengeful renegade Romulans. During that time, James T. Kirk, while undeniably talented in the Captain's chair, has still not fully understood the responsibility that comes with sitting in it. After a mission to save a primitive race ends up with Kirk violating the Prime Directive, he is demoted in rank--thanks to an incident report filed by Spock (Zachary Quinto)--and assigned to serve as first officer to his mentor, Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), who will be resuming command of the Enterprise. Meanwhile, devastating acts of terrorism committed by mysterious former Starfleet operative John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) have rocked their largely peaceful society. During an emergency meeting called to deal with the latest attack, Harrison ambushes Starfleet headquarters and causes the death of much of Starfleet's key personnel, including Admiral Pike. Enraged and seeking vengeance, Kirk corners Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) and volunteers to lead a manhunt for Harrison into the Neutral Zone and beyond, to Qo'noS (Kronos), the homeworld of the mysterious Klingon Empire. But what Kirk doesn't know is that there is more to ""John Harrison"" than meets the eye...

Might as well get to it... **MANY SPOILERS AHEAD**

So it's not really a spoiler, everyone knows by now that ""John Harrison"" is just a cover identity for none other than one Khan Noonien Singh. If you only know Benedict Cumberbatch from BBC's Sherlock, prepare to be mesmerized as he kicks all manner of ass here playing the Trek universe's preeminent villain. I do think J.J. Abrams and company could have tried a little harder to find someone who is not a pasty Englishman to play Khan, one of the more important characters in Trek lore; Sendhil Ramamurthy (""Heroes"") comes to mind as a good candidate, an actual Indian. However, at the end of the day the performance is what really matters, and Cumberbatch gives a terrific one. (I mean, he's no Montalban, but then who is?) Unfortunately, there is no explanation as to why Khan looks so different, coming from an era before the timeline was altered.

Khan's presence here, of course, means plenty of ""homages"" and reworkings of famous scenes from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, including a reversal of Spock's poignant death scene. Here, it's Kirk who selflessly sacrifices himself for the sake of the crew, while his friend Spock looks on helplessly. It's an iffy thing, recreating one of the best-known and most emotional scenes in all of Trek, and they almost pull it off except for two factors, a combination of bad writing and misplaced fan service:

The first is some clumsy foreshadowing earlier in the film where McCoy (Karl Urban) is experimenting on a dead Tribble using some of Khan's blood, which now has some incredible healing properties apparently...? Someone asks him what he's doing, and he says, basically, ""Oh, I'm just experimenting with this dead Tribble [for no logical reason] using this blood, it's got the most amazing regenerative properties I've ever seen, blah blah blah""; it's inserted so awkwardly into the ongoing action that even newbies will think, ""Hmm, gee, I wonder if THAT information is going to be important later?"" Meanwhile, members of the audience who've seen Wrath of Khan already are now ten steps ahead of the film and know exactly where this is going.

The second (and the worst moment of the film, for my money) comes after Kirk has succumbed to radiation and Spock, mute with rage, looks at his now-dead friend, then screams ""KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!"" Words can't accurately convey just how convey how goofy this moment is, how much it damages the emotion of that moment. I get why they put it in; it's one of the key things, if not THE key thing, that most people remember from Wrath of Khan, and they were going to shoehorn it in somewhere. And yes, sometimes fan service is cool, IF IT SERVES THE STORY YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL. If it doesn't fit the movie, you've got to let it go. The original worked so well because it was a character moment. It's hammy, campy, over-the-top, and yet it's rooted in genuine rage all at the same time. You need a guy like Shatner, who can be hammy, over-the-top and seem genuine all at the same time, to sell a line like that. Zachary Quinto, for all his particular strengths, is not that guy.

So finally, at the end, Spock gets mad and goes after Khan, proceeding to beat him into a pulp. I feel like the filmmakers are creating an unfortunate trend in this new Trek universe where Spock is more or less encouraged to fly off the handle, something that would be considered anathema to the Spock we've come to know and love over 40+ years. At one point, Khan belittles Spock, saying ""you can't even bring yourself to break bones."" So at the end of the picture, what do we see? Spock breaking Khan's bones during their fight, something that is presented as a triumphant moment. I recognize that this is, strictly speaking, not the same character as before, but I feel it's a detriment to the character that, instead of using his two main traits--intelligence and resolve--to win out, Spock just has to ""hulk out"" a little now and it's enough to save the day.

Oh yeah, and the Klingons were completely wasted. They were in and out of the movie in less than five minutes! The filmmakers could have used any other alien race, could have placed Harrison on any number of alien planets beyond the Neutral Zone, and it would not have mattered. It's a real disappointment that the reintroduction of the most important culture in Trek outside of Earth and Vulcan is so casually tossed off. Truly a letdown.

**END SPOILERS**

Star Trek Into Darkness has many, many flaws, but it's still entertaining as a popcorn adventure with at least some big ideas. It still isn't terribly original yet, but maybe with a second sequel the filmmakers can finally craft some new ideas instead of remixing old ones. If Abrams and Co. do decide to make a third film, hopefully they will finally embrace some of the headier aspects of Trek (though it isn't likely). The performances are good, Cumberbatch's in particular. Watch and enjoy... but don't think too hard about it.

Picture and sound quality were great when I saw them in the theater, as expected. The 3D was very well integrated, especially in the opening scenes, even though the film is just as impressive visually in 2D (we saw it twice). I will update this review with Blu Ray specs when it comes out.

Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)

Starring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Weller, Bruce Greenwood
Directed By: J.J. Abrams",1370563200,4,7447,4.843553459119497
5294819,4,B009934S5M,"For starters I think it is necessary to say that I will probably insult a few people in this review, horrify others, and hopefully make one or two people laugh.  This review will contain a spoiler or two (I'll try to keep them vague).  It will also most likely draw the ire of a few people who think I am off my rocker when it comes to my opinion of the film and of Star Trek in general.  Just know that I do really enjoy the original series and most of the films that it spawned as well as many of the spin-off shows and books.  My review will be written from the heart, tongue firmly in cheek, and with no ill will toward anyone.

And so begins my review that CONTAINS SPOILERS.  ""Shields up, Prairie Cajun!""

I walked into the theater a couple of weeks ago with my daughter in tow.  As much as I love Doctor Who and Star Wars, her passion burns just as brightly for Star Trek.  She loves the original series and ST:TNG, and is especially fond of Spock, Bones, Data, and Captain Picard.  I didn't plan on seeing Star Trek Into Darkness until it had been out for awhile, but she insisted on seeing it as soon as possible.  We saw it in 3-D and by the end of the film, the rebooted crew of the Enterprise had once again impressed me and solidified her love of the franchise.

As the film began, I felt a great disturbance in the Force.  It was as if millions of Trekkies witnessed J.J. Abrams dash the Prime Directive on the rocks of his Star Wars-infused childhood.  The crew of the Enterprise was actually trying to save a race of primitives on a planet that was about to go belly up via a volcano.  Instead of letting nature take its course, Kirk and company literally freeze the destruction of the primitives, expose themselves and the Enterprise to the people (which leads to a new idol for the primitives to worship), and also endangers the life of Spock.  Naturally this gets Kirk into a whole heap of trouble with Admiral Pike, but in true Trek fashion, Kirk manages to skirt any real punishment and is put under the command of Pike who is given back the helm of the Enterprise.

Meanwhile, a dark and mysterious figure begins manipulating a poor fellow who is a part of Starfleet.  Whovians will recognize him as Mickey (Noel Clark) from the new Doctor Who era.  This leads to the destruction of a Starfleet archive, which leads to all of the head honchos (including Kirk and Spock, naturally) gathering in one place, which makes it ever-so-easy for the mysterious figure to attack and nearly wipeout all of the biggest members of Starfleet in one fell swoop.  Kirk and Spock are two of the survivors, obviously.  Kirk is basically given the green light to find and destroy the mysterious guy at any and all costs.  Spock follows his lead, but only after making it very clear that he disagrees with the actions of Kirk and of a certain high-ranking official in Starfleet.  To top it all off, Scotty quits, refusing to have any hand in the militarization of the Enterprise in order for it to catch its prey.

From that point on, more people are manipulated, orders are questioned, and an old enemy from the original series reveals himself to maybe/maybe not be the villain behind all of the bad things that are happening to Kirk and the rest of Starfleet.

I could literally hear the wailing and gnashing of Trekkie teeth while watching this film.  Abrams not only revives an old and beloved villain, he makes him likeable!  He makes this villain work WITH Kirk and then backstab him all within a few minutes of the film!  I was actually pulling for the ""villain"" a lot of the time, and to top it all off, Abrams takes a pivotal scene from the most beloved film in the entirety of Star Trek and reverses the roles of its two key members!  He then goes on to take a popular line uttered by one of those said members in Star Trek II, places it within the scene, and has the other person say it!!  Oh, the horror, the outrage!!!!

Once again I felt a disturbance in the Force!  It was as if Abrams had evacuated his bowels all over the memories of the high and mighty Trek.  Children were weeping!  Women were screaming!  Cats and dogs were living together!  I literally had friends who got rid of any and everything associated with Abrams' rebooted Trek.  Others were so upset with what had happened to their beloved franchise that they were turning to ""lesser"" franchises like Firefly and, dare I say it, Babylon 5, for comfort!

And then it hit me.

Abrams is brilliant.  He took a franchise that is so loved by its fans and made them see it for what it really is....another space opera.  I've always held the belief that Trekkies placed Trek on a pedestal far taller than it deserved to be upon.  Don't get me wrong.  I've taken my love of Star Wars and Doctor Who to places it has no business being, but Trekkies always managed to take their love just a bit farther and for that, I love them.  I believe that they are so very passionate about their franchise that they forget that the original Trek had its share of cheese, objectification of women, bad acting, and more often than once the Prime Directive was violated.  Kirk was a cowboy in space.  Spock was supposed to be his anchor of logic and Bones the unbridled passion.  When the two combined, they made Kirk a better person.  That, at least to me, is the core of Trek.  It really wasn't until The Next Generation that politics, social issues, etc. came to the forefront of the franchise.  The original series had its moments, but in the end it was meant to be entertaining, and I do believe Abrams has succeeded in doing that with the franchise.  Heck, if you dig deep enough, you'll see that Abrams does manage to touch on modern issues like terrorism and the abuse of power.  He does all of this with lots of bang and zip, which is, quite frankly, something that TNG, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise often lacked.

Now, I am by no means a Star Trek wizard.  My opinion is based purely on what I've read and watched over the years.  I'm sure there are fans of Trek reading my words right now and laughing out loud, possibly calling me an idiot, and I'm okay with that.  I've been a nerd for the entirety of my life and can handle name calling and other forms of verbal abuse.

With all of that out of the way, I'll briefly state that the production values in this film were top notch.  I expected nothing less from Abrams and his gang.  The story is fast-paced, well written, and enjoyable to see unfold on the screen.  The few extra bucks for 3-D are entirely worth it.  All of the returning cast did excellent jobs, especially Karl Urban and Chris Pine.  Peter Weller was solid in his role and Benedict Cumberbatch owned the screen any time he was on it (even when he wasn't speaking).  Alice Eve wasn't too shabby, either.

I really enjoyed this flick.  I'll buy it when it is released on DVD and Blu-ray.  I highly recommend it, even to hardcore Trekkies.  You'll scream and tear your flesh, but in the end you will enjoy this film.

5294820,1,B009934S5M,"First off let me start with the positives. The action is shot well, the actors all do their job, and the music wasn't half bad.
Its those things that keep this from being one of the worst films Ive seen this year. And boy did it try its best to suck. The story was nonexistent, rather the writers decided to liberally lift from previous films and incarnations of Star trek, the dialog was bad (apart from Scotty, but its Simon Pegg, so of course he's awesome), and the ""science"" part of this science fiction was really bad. Using cold fusion to defuse a volcano? Actually dropping Spock into the volcano in person rather than just beaming the device from space? Theres so much wrong with the prologue alone, one could dedicate a thesis paper on it. To me the biggest offense this film took was using the events around 9/11 in a shockingly tasteless way. Im surprised more people weren't outraged by this film, because it was offensive on all fronts.

I know a lot of people probably don't agree with me, but I find it hard to believe that this is the best JJ Abrams and co could come up with after what was a really fun reboot of the franchise (yes im aware its flawed as well)",1370476800,26,1177,4.3744292237442925
5294821,2,B009934S5M,"So, asbestos armor on, and into the breach... *SPOILERS AHEAD*

I don't share a lot of others' objections to this movie. Yes, the characters are somewhat different - they are different actors. And sure, the movie differed from whatever TOS or TNG or whatever episode or movie any individual viewer may find best - but those episodes and movies differed a lot from each other. And yes, some of the dynamics changed, but as others have pointed out, it's a parallel universe changed by altering the timeline.

But... What bothers me is the laziness. The changed timeline excuses almost anything, but what it can't excuse is fundamental changes in someone who went into cryosleep a century before the timeline was changed. Why does Khan look so very different? Why is he an order of magnitude stronger? Why does he have miraculous healing abilities?

And what kills me is this could all have been addressed with a few lines of exposition. How about this:
Spock: ""There is no record of him existing until a year ago. And yet, one of the earliest records we have is of cosmetic surgery to alter his appearance. Why change the appearance of someone with no records in the first place?"" Because that someone is an infamous, exiled war criminal, of course. This could start the audience really wondering, ""Who is this guy?""

Then change the order of some of the exposition, so the Admiral does a bit of a reveal of Harrison's nature before they confront Khan on Kronos: ""We're outclassed as a species. The Romulans, the Klingons, they're warrior races. So... we experimented. A bioenhancement. It made the recipients smarter, stronger... Much smarter. Much stronger. Able to heal from almost any injury. Immune to disease. But the test subjects couldn't take it. So many of them died. The strongest, the ones with the most willpower, went insane or their bodies went haywire. We needed a stronger host. And we found them. We found the records of a an old sleeper ship, where they exiled the last tyrants of the Eugenics Wars. We found them, gave them the serum - and it worked! By God, it worked! Better than we could ever have hoped!""

Now you've got the audience who remembers Space Seed going ""Cr@p, Khan is back and now he's stronger and smarter and invulnerable?!""

And you've explained the change in appearance and abilities, and why he's more psychotic, and the ""magic blood,"" all thanks to thirty seconds of additional dialogue.

If you want to be a little more ambitious, add a couple of scenes:

Khan as a prisoner tempts Kirk. ""Imagine, Captain. We few, we perfect specimens, we can transcend mortality."" [Looks at Kirk appraisingly] ""You could survive the serum, I think, Captain. You could be one of the elect."" Throw in a little morality play, the essence of humanity, morality of biotech, etc.

At the end, have McCoy tell Kirk they filtered all the serum out of him. Then cut to a scene with a couple of Federation scientists. ""He tolerated the serum amazingly well."" ""Yes. Fascinating."" (I'm thinking the second scientist is Vulcan.) Pan to a fetus in a canister of liquid with a label reading, ""Kirk, James Tiberius.""  Fade out. When the movie series starts to flag, trot out a superhuman ""Tiberius Kirk"" villain as an homage to the ""evil Kirk"" TOS episodes.

So that's about two minutes of additional easy footage.

If you want to be more ambitious, change the opening sequence on the alien planet to a planet where the Admiral and his co-conspirators have been abandoning the insane, twisted survivors of the initial serum experiments. Maybe the volcano was artificially induced when the conspirators decided to eliminate the evidence after Khan went rogue. Maybe the crackdown on Kirk for violating the Prime Directive is really driven by paranoia that he interfered with and almost discovered the cover-up.

Obviously that's just an example of a slightly different way to go, but it feels like it would have been so easy to fix the continuity issues that Abrams wasn't even trying. Instead, we get throw-away references to TOS - tribbles, Gorns, and of course ""KHAAAAAN!"" I'm sorry, and I know I'm in the minority, but it just feels lazy, and to be honest, that really bugs me.",1370476800,23,4190,4.818941504178273
5294822,4,B009934S5M,"Make no mistake: this movie is not your grandaddy's Trek.  Per this latest sequel, the rebooted ""Star Trek"" franchise with director J.J. Abrams in the driver's seat is now confirmed as an adrenaline-pumping, warp-speed summer action adventure series with razzle-dazzle special effects.  Yes, Abrams' take on Trek is incredibly superficial as compared to the more intelligent, thematic films that the original cast appeared in.  You certainly won't be finding timeless literary references to Dickens, Melville, or even Shakespeare in J.J.'s movie.  That said, I still absolutely enjoyed seeing this film in the thrill of opening weekend and chose at the time to ignore its glaring flaws.  Hence, I hope you will find my review well-balanced as follows.

THE GOOD: In terms of performances, the ensemble (Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, etc.) and newcomers Benedict Cumberbatch, Alice Eve, and Peter Weller provide top-flight entertainment equal to, if not better than the 2009 film.  Even if McCoy, Chekov, and especially Sulu have minimal screen time, the cast members each receive great individual moments.  Predictably, Kirk and Spock both have big action scenes, as Spock finally gets his first solo fistfight (it is well worth waiting for, especially for who gives him some help).  Alice Eve (as young Dr. Carol Marcus), Peter Weller (as Admiral Marcus), and Benedict Cumberbatch (as the mysterious John Harrison) blend seamlessly into the fast-paced, energetic storyline, as long as one can suspend disbelief about the script's plot holes.  Supported by a terrific musical score, the gaudy special effects are mostly superb, if not particularly realistic.  Without a doubt, the engagingly brash story is sufficient for the price of admission to see this movie.  Just think of it as a sneak preview of what likely director Abrams will do with the next ""Star Wars"" film in 2015.

THE BAD: Yes, there are some spoilers here.  As much as I appreciated the wink-wink homages to ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (watch for Kirk's use of the Han Solo phrase ""Punch it!"" and a familiar banking flight maneuver escaping from the Klingons) and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (Kirk and McCoy do their best Indiana Jones imitations fleeing from pursuing aliens in the opening sequence), it struck me that Abrams' screenwriting team should have tried harder to push originality and depth over the ""ain't it cool"" approach.  Case in point: the finale from ""STII: The Wrath of Khan"" is so blatantly lifted (and then ""reimagined"") that STII's screenwriters, director Nicholas Meyer and producer Harve Bennett, should have been at least acknowledged in the new film's lengthy credits.  Further, Cumberbatch's super-soldier is actually pretty generic compared to the original, fiendishly flamboyant incarnation of Trek's greatest villain, Khan.  Cumberbatch is an excellent actor, but he is not Khan - the late Ricardo Montalban made Khan so believably diabolical as is.  Here, viewers are supposed to believe that the new Khan is somehow both a super-soldier and a genius 23rd Century weapons designer thawed out from the 1990's by the Federation.  As a result, we get Kirk & Spock vs. Khan, Round 3 on steroids - even after thirty years, the two previous doses of Khan (from 1967 TV episode ""Space Seed"" and 1982's ""STII"") still remain plenty enough.

Unfortunately, using ESP-powered Gary Mitchell (from the original series' pilot episode) as the film's villain didn't happen.  It would have made far more sense to use him for the Federation's treacherous secret weapon, complete with a personal grudge against Captain Kirk already in place.  Cumberbatch would have excelled playing Mitchell.  Further, the plot twists involving Admiral Marcus and a monster-sized starship OR a starship crashing OR Federation treachery OR a resurrected major character have already been done before in Trek movies.  Instead of exploring some strange new worlds in this alternate timeline, Abrams and the screenwriting team certainly deserve an EPA achievement award for all the recycling they end up doing here.

THE QUESTIONABLE: Unlike its 2009 predecessor, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" hasn't inspired a glut of kid-oriented merchandising, especially toys.  That is a wise choice, as there are several adult scenes that are inappropriate for younger viewers.  I'm not just talking about the massive amounts of sci-fi violence (including the crushing of a human head and a violent attack against a defenseless woman), but there are also two instances of implied sexual content that easily could have been omitted.  Hence, please remember that the PG-13 rating is definitely justifiable.  As a final note, any appearance by Leonard Nimoy is always appreciated, but his cameo was frankly unnecessary.  I suspect he was included simply to bolster credibility of this new Khan storyline.

If you enjoyed the 2009 film, then I highly recommend ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" -- even if the entertaining, depth-free script digs into the Trek archives far too often instead of boldly going somewhere else no one has gone before.

Rating: 4/5 stars.

P.S.  It is unclear when or if Paramount Studios will make another Trek film assuming media reports are accurate that the studio wasn't happy with an opening weekend box office take of less than $100 million dollars.  Time will tell, but any greedy studio should remember that a bloated movie budget doesn't override the law of unrealistic expectations.",1370476800,20,5461,5.252304147465438
5294823,5,B009934S5M,We love this movie.  It remains true to the original and is good family fun.  I can't wait for the next one to come out.,1370476800,2,120,3.76
5294824,4,B009934S5M,"The title Star Trek Into Darkness is misleading. The trailer, too, leads one to believe this is a tale of revenge. And this film features Khan. The film Star Trek II is dedicated to Khan Noonien Singh's obsession with revenge. In one scene, released to the public before the movies premier, Captain Pike tells Captain Kirk something like, ""The Federation isn't about personal vendettas"". Captain Kirk replies, ""Maybe it should be"".

Instead what Captain Kirk learns, pretty much on his own, perhaps as a continuation of the end of the first film Star Trek 2009, is that justice is not about revenge. Human life isn't his to take. At least not in cold blood. Leonard Nimoy appears again in this film and he also provides a firm sense of moral grounding. Nimoy's performance here is not solely about bringing Vulcan sensibilities to the part? Surely we are seeing something of the real Leonard Nimoy in his performance. Nimoy would title his second autobiography, ""I am Spock"". The apparent moral certainty Nimoy helps bring to the film feels real, probably because it is. In the previous film, the Romulan Captain Nero destroys Spock's home world, in a quest for revenge of a sort. All the elder Spock can say about Nero, after pausing to think about it, is that Nero is 'troubled' as if he's concerned about Nero. The ending of this film, at least Kirk's medical recovery, leads one to wonder if perhaps Khan might return.

We also learn that friendship is more important than truth. For Spock, who cannot tell a lie, this is something he will learn, or be corrupted by, over a lifetimes worth of experience. When captain Kirk falsifies a report to Star Fleet, I was kind of hoping the lesson to be learned would be one about the importance of being truthful, but instead we're learning about the importance of friendship. And also that friends believe different things than we do and sometimes live in different ways than we do, but we should still be committed to them. It's what gives life meaning?

In a Star Trek episode from the original series, 'The Enterprise Incident', Spock does lie, convincing a Roluman Captain that he's defecting from Star Fleet. He's actually on a spy mission. He uses the fact that it's known Vulcan's cannot lie against this female captain. When she discovers the deception, Spock confesses that, ""I was not unmoved"" by this woman's advances. In one of the more famous episodes from the original serious, 'Mirror, Mirror' the crew are errantly beamed aboard an Enterprise that exists in an alternate universe. One where the Federation is an 'Empire' that rules by maintaining terror. When captain Kirk is talking to his concubine on the evil ship, a woman who's figured out something is wrong, captain Kirk tells her, ""you're the captains woman until he says you're not"". He plans on finding his way back to his own Enterprise.

As other reviewers have noted, this film sails closer to Gene Roddenberry's 'humanistic vision'. Whether it's been made under the influence of Roddenberry or not, this film has a proverbial heart.

I agree with this view, however, a small minority of Star Trek fans have claimed that the original series was all about Captain Kirk. Even that Kirk represented the antithesis of humanism. That each week, Captain Kirk would outsmart the counter-culture figures on the show, presented in the guise of aliens or rogue factions of the Federation, correct the error of their ways, and sometime before or after bed their women. Perhaps it's about those in the Federation, reactionaries and the educated, artists and scientists, uniting and coming together over common cause. Or more likely still, it is about friendship. As Star Trek moved to the series Next Generation, and Gene Roddenberry presumably held more control over the Star Trek, it did become more cerebral. In the ensuing generations it's returned to being more about action, even more so than the original incarnation, and that trend has continued here in Into Darkness.

Anyway, I think I enjoyed the first film more, Star Trek 2009. Perhaps it was the joy of seeing these characters in action once again, because that movie had a, pardon the phrase, illogical plot. In the 2009 film there's more dialog between the crew members. This new film has a heart. I'd feel more comfortable recommending it, I think.",1370476800,3,4329,4.882993197278911

The role reversal (Kirk dying/resurecting, Spock screaming 'Khaaaaaaaaaan) was formulaic and in all honesty a little pathetic to my mind.  I actually laughed out loud when Spock screamed.

5294830,1,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a boring, unintelligent throw up ride filled with lens flares and flashy, at-lightening-speed action scenes with handsome, sexy, two dimensional characters flashing their sexiness in front of said lens flares, reciting Star Trek jargon; This movie was a complete piece of trash as Star Trek.. It was an even worse dumbing down of a great sci-fi franchise to fit the attention span of the Jersey Shore generation than the first one by Abrams. The sheer fact of plagiarizing a past story devoid of all the emotional weight and resonance is probably enough to relegate it there.

J.J. Abrams is obviously a Star Wars fan - everything in this movie (and the one before it) indicates that.

The distinction between the two began to collapse altogether with J. J. Abrams's first Star Trek film in 2009, and its demise was rendered official with the news early this year that the director would also be taking over future installments of the Star Wars franchise. Abrams's latest outing, Star Trek Into Darkness represents a final burial.

Let's face it, the man is not hired to produce quality movies, he is hired to produce marketable junk. And that he did. So much budget and money and all they could come up with was this boring junk of a tourist trinket that absolutely did not add anything to the world of Star Trek. Seriously. Absolutely nothing.

The movie ruminates loudly, if never very coherently, about the typical fight of good vs evil that is so central to the theme of Star Wars; about war and peace, vengeance and justice, preemptive attack and negotiated settlement. Kirk and Spock having a destiny to be friends - as if the fabric of the universe as we know it would collapse if these two did not become friends or as if their friendship - among billions out there - was the one that had to transcend time and space. As if their friendship was the Jedi of friendships without which there can never be good in the universe. Completely absurd.

Star Trek never cared for creating messiahs or holy men and the only time they did (Sisko as the Emissary) turns out that those prophets the Bajorans prayed to were beings existing on a different plane of existence.  No magic was in place. No destiny and messiah. Why these two _need_ to be friends eludes me. To bring the force and balance to the universe? So much so that the one message the old Spock had for humanity in this alternate timeline was not one on how to prevent wars and genocides and numerous atrocities but how these two need to remain friends no matter what timeline they are in? It is imperative to not divulge information regarding other events since they must fulfill their destiny as the old Spock put it, but it is ok to give Spock and Kirk pointers about their friendship that just must transcend time and space?

Star Trek has always been about real people, however, not archetypes fulfilling destinies. Unlike Star Wars, Star Trek is not a fairy tale of good vs evil, heroes vs. villains. In Star Wars everyone is either a guru, a princess,  a chosen one but none of them - with the exception of Han Solo - was a real person. They were archetypes fighting the typical fight of good vs evil. Chosen prince vs dark emperor. We never find out what the force really is, what creates it and drives it. It is juts there and the story is about how to make the ""force"" work for you. That is entering a multitude of fairy tale territories, not science fiction.

Note that science fiction is a ""what if"" scenario in which the effects of technology or technologies that currently do not exist are explored. Thus, it is ""fiction"" that revolves around such ""science"".

In Star Wars, we do not have any of that. It is neither about humans (since there are no humans in Star Wars, just people called such) nor about the effects of science. In this case, the light saber and  hyperdrive may as well be Excalibur and chariots.

Star Trek has also never had to rely on magical tricks and such to make the stories work. It's characters were real. Real people with real problems; with hopes, dreams, goals and careers - not abstract heroes fighting the good fight for the sake of fighting the good fight or taking revenge.

All that has changed ever since Abrams has added his Star Wars flair and preference to the Trek world.

The action sequences are plentiful and characterized by a certain gee-whiz exuberance. This being an Abrams/Lindelof venture, there are multiple sets of Daddy Issues to resolve. And we are subjected to an escalating experiment in the human tolerance for lens flare.

The entire realization and reimagination of the Trek universe is just an insult to Gene Roddenberry and the Star Trek he had imagined starting with The Original Series to all the subsequent shows and movies under Roddenberry's and then his co-creator Rick Berman's supervision. And I am not talking about setup and scenery, I am talking about the themes inherent in Star Trek. This movie does not honor Roddenberry's vision at all.  It is not intelligent or thought provoking. It is not about space exploration and asking the tough questions, it does not truly establish and explore its characters and their relationships with one another, there is no attempt at science, philosophy, morality and in understanding other cultures.

If it was not for the Star Trek lingo and names of familiar characters, I would not believe that this is a Star Trek production. The plot holes are gaping and the internal consistencies - regardless of past productions - are staggering and too much to ignore. Here are just a few:

1) Apparently orders are purely optional in this here Abrams' Star Trek. No one follows anyone's orders. If you don't wanna follow an order, just resign your commission and hang out in a bar and wait to be reinstated. Don't worry about a court martial or any kind of consequences. Abrams and his writers have completely failed to understand how military hierarchies work.

2)Spock has been turned into a pedantic, stickler who seems to delight in sticking it to others (such as Kirk). He has none of the humor or the pathos that Prime Spock did in The Original Series or the movies.

Mr. Quinto's idea of being a Vulcan is apparently just having no facial expression. That's all. Other than that, he's pretty emotional. Even with a bad script, Nimoy could add just a little something to indicate the depths of his character. Quinto adds nothing. He is mechanical when Spock is logical, and a blubbering tool when Spock is emotional. There's no middle ground, no subtlety, no mystery. Logic is an attitude, a way of life - you breathe, live, think and walk logic. It's not just lack of facial expression and pointy ears. Quinto's Spock with its fake, stagey references to logic and over usage of Star Trek lingo was beyond annoying and obviously placed in there not by people who actually understand, know and care about Star Trek but by people who've done their research and are strategically employing the lingo into the script and dialog to make it ""Star Trek"".

Finally, the Uhura romance: it is hard to believe that Spock, who in this portrayal is a pedantic prissy a$$ bent on enforcing all rules no matter how picayune, would have a sexual relationship with one of his students. It just makes no sense, and it smacks of writers trying to ""sex it up,"" logic be damned.

3) Kirk and Spock have absolutely no chemistry, and thus no camaraderie, between them. Or maybe it is Pine and Quinto. I don't know. Something is amiss. There is no basis for their friendship. In fact, there is nothing to indicate in the behavior of either that they even like each other, much less view each other as friends willing to sacrifice themselves for the other - as they did in the end. Nothing in the story indicates that, except for a script that expects us to just fill in the blanks in that regard.

If I had only seen this and the previous movie, I would be absolutely clueless as to why these two are friends. In order for Kirk's sacrifice to evoke emotional resonance and make us want to care as the audience, it has to have meaning - which is to be found in the friendship. Here, no friendship has been established, only animosity. That was the case in the first movie and it is the case now as well.

In The Wrath of Khan, even if you had seen nothing else from Trek, it was established in several scenes on screen that these guys are life long friends who care a great deal for each other. There are birthday presents, meaningful conversations about life and mortality, there are bonding moments between Kirk and Spock that make their friendship meaningful and give both characters depth and nuances.  This, in turn, allows the viewer to put the death scene in context.

Here, there are fistfights explosions and insults. That's it. This is their ""friendship."" So when Kirk sacrifices himself for Spock you cannot help but feel  a little lost. It is still unclear to me how Kurtzman and Orci get paid millions to come up with such lousy stories. This is not even about Star Trek or anything, this is just pure story telling - or lack thereof. Characters need to behave in ways that make sense and naturally follow from the story and actions of the characters - not just be implanted there because it is convenient.

When Kirk said ""I want you to know why I saved you on the planet,"" I thought to myself: ""Yeah! Me, too!""

Spock yelling ""Khan!!!!"" belied the characterization of Spock, as well as being an expression of emotion that was unearned. But more importantly: KHAN WASN'T RESPONSIBLE for the malfunction on the ship that Kirk ""sacrificed"" himself to rectify. If anything, Spock should have been yelling ""MARCUSSSSS!!""

4) Star Trek, unlike Star Wars, is not driven by special effects and CGI. Special effects can't make you laugh, or cry, or care about anything or anyone. If nearly every scene consists of numbing space battles and CGI monster battles, it just gets tiring. The cacophony of action sequences just got boring after a while and it just felt gratuitous and pointless.

5) Star Trek didn't have the benefit of metric tons of money to blow on effects (Well, real Star Trek doesn't, anyway). Instead, it had to make us care about characters, cultures, and organizations. I cared more about Captain Kirk dodging a foam rock than I ever cared about Obi-Wan McGregor fighting General Grievously Stupid. And I also don't care about Kirk going after the sociopath Khan in this movie either - because I was never given the chance to care about Kirk in the first place.

Watching scene after scene of ""pew-pew-pew-KABOOM!"" just is not appealing to me. And that is the problem: nothing intelligent happens in this movie. There are battles and wars every once in a while in Star Trek, but mostly, there are science fiction stories that describe the universe and its societies, instead of blowing them all up.

6) The Klingons and Kronos: the former looked nothing like the Klingons we have ever seen in any Trek version and Kronos looked like a freaking sound stage. The bridge of the Enterprise still looks like a Bloomingdale's make up counter and more technologically advanced than the slip stream drive ships of 2378 in Star Trek: Voyager. Dialog and ""character"" development consist of ""Bones"" making a weird face and cracking lame jokes, putting a newbie in charge of engineering because the chief engineer decided to not follow orders and Uhura making the brilliant observation and complaint about Spock having no feelings and not showing them to her. Well, no NO KIDDING GENIUS. When did that occur to you? When he said he was VULCAN and on his way to embrace only logic?

7) Overall, the aliens, the action scenes and overall demeanor of the show resembled more a Star Wars meets Transformers meets Jack Bourne production than Star Trek. The story did not revolve around the effects that these technologies, such as eugenics in this case, have or had on Humans and their society. In fact, they did not explore, comment on or critique the Eugenics wars at all - something which is a central theme for the Khan arc and especially central to the concept of Star Trek - which is all about how technology and science affect humans/humanoid civilization and life as opposed to just chasing down archetypes of bad guys while rewarding the ""good guys.""

8) Boy the directors must have studied Memory Alpha since their new favorite word used was the Prime Directive. And don't even get me started on the Section 31 garbage stolen from DS9 and misplaced in this universe. And then that ""permission to come on the bridge"" garbage by a stowaway bimbo in a short skirt whose principle role in the film is to appear briefly in her underwear, thus achieving the dual purposes of supplying Kirk with a romantic interest for the next installment and also being an expert in weapons of mass destruction? WTF?

9) One of my expectations, which is apparently a foolish one, was that the iconic Khan Noonian Singh, a Sikh character, would not be whitewashed and played by a white, British guy, Benedict Cumberbatch, but by someone of East Indian descent or maybe at least someone resembling someone from such a background. With his casting choice of a Caucasian man in the form of Cumberbatch, J.J. Abrams has proven that he doesn't even humor us anymore. He didn't even attempt to make the character at least resemble  someone with East Indian origins.
Roddenberry's vision, I think not.

Now before people jump my throat saying that the original Khan wasn't played by an East Indian either, consider this: back in the 60s, when Ricardo Montalbn was cast to play Khan (a character explicitly described in the episode script of ""Space Seed"" as being Sikh, from the Northern regions of India), he had huge racial barriers and bigotry to overcome in a society where racism and segregation were institutionalized. The pressures Roddenberry faced from the television networks to cast ""sensibly"" as he put it were immense and serious and are well documented. Therefore, for the 60s and the times he was in, having a brown-skinned man (Montalbn) play a brown character was a hard-won victory.

Fast forward some 40+ years later where apparently despite all our changes as a society supposedly embracing diversity, inclusion and otherness, we see that not only has nothing changed with respect to executive demands for ""sensible"" casting, but we see that said producers and film makers are not even trying to hide their attempts at bigotry.

Just this week Abercrombie and Fitch was under fire (as they have been for years now) for portraying their brand and image towards the run-of-the-mill homogenous blonde, blue eyed, chiseled-ab folks. Yet here we got a movie that does exactly the same thing, and people think it's a hit and brilliant and supposedly so very true to Gene Roddenberry's vision.

Really?

It's disappointing and demoralizing that with the commercial power of Star Trek in his hands, JJ Abrams chose not to honor the original spirit of the show, or the symbolic heft of the Khan character, but to wield the whitewash brush for ... what? The hopes that casting Benedict Cumberbatch would draw in a few more box office returns?

10) The characterization of Khan in this movie was just plain wrong and reduced Khan just to the archetypal villain as opposed to a complex, brilliant character.  The Khan from Space Seed was ruthless, but he wasn't cruel for cruelty sake. He was a tyrant, not a sociopath, and there's a big difference. He marooned the crew of the Reliant, he didn't kill them. in cold blood. Khan in this movie, on the other hand, crashing the ship and, in particular, the -violence on the bridge of the Vengeance was really awful and depicted Khan as nothing but the archetypal villain rather than the intelligent, brilliant, and ferocious man that he was.

Overall I think that as a story about revenge and anger (if you don't care about anything else and are a teenager, that is) it's pretty OK. Khan is a maniac terrorist. Boo, we hate terrorists. Check. Kirk hates this particular terrorist because he gunned down his surrogate daddy. Yay, we like revenge! Check. Love story between the withholding man and hot woman who is crazy about him. We love love stories. Check. Obligatory blonde model-slash-actor superfluous character to add a young and sexy ""edge"" to the show plus a possible love interest for Pine, Yaay! We all want to see him hooking up with a blonde model -slash -actor, yaay! Check.

I guess it works on a very broad scale. But the question now is, how many more vengeance and anger stories can be told? Kirk is running out of daddies, and now death can be cured with a handy injection, whatdo'ya know. Isn't that nifty?

Since this was a reboot of the franchise and conveniently taking place in an alternate timeline, the writers were given a white canvas to work with and come up with new ideas and ways to imagine the Trek Universe and take out heroes on journeys they have not gone yet, not rehash the past and redo something, such as The Wrath of Khan, that was brilliant as is and did not need redoing.

Alas, there are alien creatures to be chased, fugitive baddies to capture, Klingons to stare down, and special effects budgets to be spent. Therefore, enter the openly dizzy way that is Star Trek as only a Star Wars business-man fan can imagine it, namely as a more recognizable heir to George Lucas than to Gene Roddenberry.

As a side note: I am tired of hearing people excuse all the crap writing and lousy inconsistencies as ""well it is the parallel universe."" So what? You don't need to create engaging characters we care about, internal consistency, great story telling and a great script because it is the parallel universe? Or alternate timeline? I also have to agree with someone else who mentioned that Abrams is actually doing the franchise a huge disservice. The stuff that's been going down in this and also the previous movie is the kind of lazy bu.ll crap that takes my evaluation beyond ""these are simply bad writers"" and into ""these people actively disdain the thing they've been entrusted with.""

In the end when Khan had his torpedoes or whatever directed at ""Enterprise"" I was really hoping he kills all these losers and puts an end to this terrible reimagination of the Star Trek franchise by a Star Wars fan.",1370304000,122,18374,4.7211988760537

5294832,4,B009934S5M,"First of all, my biggest pet peeve. A lot of people complain about Spock showing too much emotion in the new movies. Does anyone remember that his mother died in front of him and that his entire planet was destroyed? The character is still young, immature, and malleable. Watch Spock in The Original Series. He displays smugness, superiority, touches of humor, annoyance, and so on. He's not a robot. Vulcans have emotions as strong, or stronger than, humans. They use logic to control them. But I'm guessing losing your planet and mother might allow cracks to show. Additionally, the last two movies take place BEFORE the original series, and if you look at Spock in ""The Cage"" - the first pilot which took place before Kirk took over, Nimoy's Spock was much more emotional - possibly even more than Quinto's Spock. Yes, that was because the character itself changed in concept, but one could also view the character as a rebel who left Vulcan - partly due to his emotional responses, and over time tried to become more and more Vulcan than human.  Nimoy's Spock was able to do this because there wasn't a huge emotional event in his life to the extent that occurred for Quinto's Spock.

Ok, pet peeve rant done.  This was a solid movie.  I was actually afraid there would be more action than there was, and while it was pretty action packed - there were moments of quiet and character development interspersed.  There were a lot of shout outs to The Wrath of Khan, but I think the movie made sense in using them.  Perhaps there were a few too many... bringing Carol Marcus in for instance, but overall I thought it worked.  Regarding Carol Marcus, people complain that she's supposed to be a molecular biologist not a weapon's tech.  Her father (and the Federation in general) was obviously affected by the events from the first movie, and probably became much more focused on military action than he would have been without Nero's arrival.  He could easily have influenced her decision of which areas of science to enter.  Still, she was the weakest link in the movie.

The characters were just as perfectly acted this time around as before, and everyone had something to do - if only for a moment.  It was an action movie, but Abrams managed to throw more character development and true feeling emotion into scenes than many directors can do with a lot more slow scenes (Iron Man 3 for instance).

I rate Star Trek II, First Contact, and maybe Star Trek VI above this one, but those were all great Science Fiction movies that just happened to be Star Trek movies too.",1370304000,5,2571,4.6490066225165565

5294835,5,B009934S5M,"To all the obsessive mega-fans who claim this is an insult to the Star Trek universe, guess what... THERE IS NO Star Trek universe. It's FICTION. It's a story, with plots and characters, locations and events-- ALL MADE UP. Sorry to shake the very foundation of your beliefs. But from the first episode of TOS, Gene Roddenberry was telling stories about truth, honor, trust, compassion, intelligence, companionship, bravery, and above all else, human emotion. We CARE about Kirk and Spock. We CARE about Scotty & Bones & all the rest. They are well-written, complex characters. The plots are (mostly) well-written, complex stories. You invest your time, and are entertained.

This movie is exciting, emotional, passionate and you become fully invested in it-- as long as you don't compare actors who might have played a particular role previously, or worry the a character dies who never did in the older versions. Enjoy the moment - it's STAR TREK for 2013, not TOS, TNG, DS9 or any other incarnation.

Beethoven wrote only one Symphony #9, but hundreds of orchestras have played it, recorded it, and not one interpretation is the same as any other. Into Darkness is an awesome interpretation of Roddenberry's creation.

5294838,1,B009934S5M,"Just saw the movie in the theaters and must say it was a visually stunning 3D film... but those lens flares, they take away about 90% of the visual appeal of the movie.  Just one question for everyone: who sees lens flares with their eyes?  Let me help you, no one... it is the result of a camera lens at the wrong angle with the sun (or light source).... but these aren't optical flares, they are CGI flares... how lame!

Now for the movie plot: (modified due being poorly worded the first time) When the movie ended I said to my wife , ""That was HORRIBLE!"" (I did end up saying it loud enough that several rows of people could have heard it, not to be a jerk but because it was so loud in the theater that I needed to be sure my wife heard me)  JJ Abrams (or the writers) should have their pay checks taken back.  Why steal from previous Star Trek movies, especially when it doesn't make sense given how early in their careers this movie is suppose to take place.

After reading many reviews on Amazon, I must agree with those who said this new Spock was horribly acted.  He does show way too many emotions.  Bones was just odd, not like the Bones I grew up with.  Then there is Carol Marcus who should have been a molecular biologist, but is instead a weapon's officer.  I also highly doubt she was ever in Star Fleet as displayed in her dislike for SF in ST2.  Then the blatant stealing of entire scenes from Star Trek 2 is just plain wrong.

There were many other problems, but would rather not put too many spoilers in this review.

The movie is too fast paced to be a good Sci-Fi movie, I would reclassify the movie as an Action movie.

In the end, I was going to buy this Blu-Ray, but now am not.  I just can't bring myself to watching this ""Star Trek"" (should be called ""Space Explosions"" instead) movie again... which is quite sad as I have seen all the original series and next gen crew movies over 100 times.

---
UPDATE (8 June 2013): There was at least one comment that mentioned the lack of details dealing with Bones.  As for Bones, it annoyed me that he was a ""Damn it, I not a ..."" whore.  It seemed that every 2 minutes he was uttering that phrase.  It is a great phrase, but that often killed the mood that it is suppose to invoke.  I think he might have said that phrase more in this one movie than in all 6 of the original movies (I am re-watching the TOS now though).

Spock: After starting to watch TOS, I have noticed more emotion from Lenard Nemoy that I remember (I have seen a smirk or two so far).  So I will lay off the new Spock for now.

Lens Flares: Still hate them.  (Seems you can't please everyone)... they are made with a flash light on set and sometimes where there isn't a light source on set (found this out after watching a special feature from the 2009 ST movie).

TWOK Issue: I still feel strongly that they should not have ripped an entire scene from TWOK and placed it in this movie.  As I mentioned in a response to another person's comment, it seems as though they ran out of new material and said, ""Hey, let's put this scene in from TWOK, the fans will love it.""  Sadly, I am not impressed (I don't like seeing a movie I have already seen before in a new movie).

I really want to like this new series, but I just can't.  I understand some love it, but I guess I just like the old school ST where it isn't all flashy action and re-used/over-used lines.  I like movies where the story and character development takes priority, esp when it comes to Star Trek, which is what most of the previous ST movies/series have been.  I must admit that a majority of TNG movies were faster paced, but they didn't reuse material and didn't rewrite the rule book on what ST is.",1370217600,51,3710,4.219858156028369

I saw it the day it opened and again last week at the best Imax theater in Manhattan and I think it is terrific, even better than the first film.

I remember thinking that it was a very long film, not because I was bored but because every time you think it is over, we get another terrific action sequence.  The 3D was also excellent, way better than Iron Man 3.  I look forward to getting it on blu-ray and I cannot truly state that I won't see it one more time in the movies.

5294842,5,B009934S5M,"It is fair to say that J. J. Abrams is a man who has found quite a bit of success within the entertainment industry.  In fact, his name likely appears on the top of a very, very short list of encouraging up-and-coming writers, producers, directors, and creators.  While few milestones are left for him to achieve, Star Trek Into Darkness does happen to represent his first responsibility as director of a sequel and a high-profile one at that.  Since it is no secret that Abrams will be helming the most highly anticipated set of sequels of all time in terms of the upcoming Star Wars episodes; Star Trek Into Darkness has a little more riding on it than usual.  Fortunately, Abrams and company have done it again, in that Star Trek Into Darkness is nothing short of spectacular!

After a four year wait, the crew of the Enterprise is back on the big screen.  Into Darkness hits the ground running with a wild, stylish opening segment that reminds us that hot-shot Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) doesn't play by anybody else's rules.  However, this time his cavalier philosophy finally catches up with him.  Kirk's chance at redemption comes at the cost of an attack on star fleet by a mysterious mad-man by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch).  Harrision's attack and subsequent retreat to hostile space leads Kirk and crew on an inter-galactic man-hunt that tests their strength, courage, and relationships.

The film looks very good and while heavy on special effects, they do not overwhelm the movie.  Abrams shot much of this film on the lot in Paramount Studios, but he was able to use realistic staging quite often, resulting in action scenes where the actors actually were able to interact with the environment and be immersed in the reality of it.  A clear example of this is a fantastic fight scene near the end of the film that takes place on top of multiple levitating barges.  The actors filmed this scene on actual moving platforms, which aid in creating a very intense tone for a pivotal scene.

A major strength of Abrams's first Star Trek was the expert casting, and that remains so in Into Darkness.  All of the iconic roles are filled with performers who understand how to balance the legacy of their characters' reputations with the modern turn necessary to freshen up the franchise.  Especially excellent is Zachary Quinto who plays a more sensitive Spock, while still preserving the stone-cold-logical element that all fans have embraced for nearly fifty years.  While inside tongue-in-cheek references are aplenty, non-trekies will be none-the-wiser and will not feel like they are missing something.  Nonetheless, Abrams does not let the notoriously passionate fans down and creates another film that will certainly have devotees reeling, laughing, and gasping at several carefully nuanced touches; study up on your Klingon!

Star Trek Into Darkness is far simpler in story and scope than its predecessor, which may disappoint those looking for twists and turns that fans of Abrams have come to expect from his work on television shows like Lost and Fringe.  While straightforward and uncomplicated in terms of plot, it is a lot of fun.  The pacing is swift, the action is great, and the all of the humor works.  Star Trek Into Darkness substantiates the latest voyages of the Starship Enterprise, which will surely live long and inevitably pro$per!  A-

Star Trek Into Darkness is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and 3 minutes.  While it was apparently not shot in 3-D, it was shot in IMAX, and the 3-D conversion is top notch and not disappointing.  See it in 2-D or 3-D, but definitely see it on an IMAX or Xtreme screen.",1370131200,4,3679,4.8370607028754
5294843,1,B009934S5M,"J.J. Abrams understands how to visually create highs and lows, excite people with his visuals and style and keep a story moving. I will give him that, but I would argue that he doesn't understand the first thing about what makes a story, good. I reviewed his version of Star Trek and I stand by that and because of that I had to, at least, give this one a chance. So I did and this was left wanting.

I don't need to restate the excitement factor that J.J. Abrams clearly understands, it is the story of this film (via Orci, Kurtzman, Lindlhof and by extension Abrams) that fails so miserably. In an attempt to remain spoiler free. Many elements of the story are included for what only can be determined to be for their excitement factor and visual style. Often, the actions of the characters make little or no sense in the greater context. Scenes exist only because they are pretty. *Keeping this review spoiler free is trickier than I thought* Sure, we can point at almost any film and laugh and/or poke fun at its inconsistencies and lapses of logic, but this film seems to put that on display, as if to rub our faces in it and say, ""This is exciting isn't it? I dare you to say its no good."" And yes, it was an exciting film, yet it was no good. It insults us by lowering the bar on what we should expect from our entertainment, as if to say one element (storytelling) isn't nearly as important as the other (excitement). But it is, at least to me. If you went to this film to simply 'ride a roller-coaster' than I say you got what you paid for. If this would have simply been a film without the Star Trek universe overlayed on top, I dare say I too would have enjoyed it on that level.

From a 'Star Trek' perspective, I am doubly insulted. J.J. Abrams and his writing team clearly have no basis or strength in Science Fiction and have nothing creative or original to add to Star Trek. The most frustrating part of this film for me is that there is nothing new here. It is simply a rehash of old Star Trek storytelling ideas and concepts, capitalizing on the 40+ years of pop-culture influence, while avoiding almost everything related to its original genre of Science Fiction. Kind of strange considering they wanted to 're-boot' the universe. Instead we are getting the same-old, same-old yet with less emotional impact as these characters don't share the same history as the original ones. It is simply baffling.

As for the secret of Kahn in the media and the magic blood others mentioned? Well, I am left speechless, or wordless as the case may be. Ugh.

Judging by its mediocre opening and lack of staying power (it is fading fast), I can only hope this is the end of J.J. Abrams being in control of Star Trek. Home Video brought this sequel to life (why do you think it took so long to get made?) I can only hope this film will not repeat that feat. Perhaps (I can dream) J. Michael Straczynski will finally get a chance to truly reinvigorate this franchise.

Despite the bile that rises in me when someone mutters Abrams and Star Trek together in the same sentence, I am actually looking forward to see what he can do with the Star Wars universe. That is a genre I feel he is better suited for.",1370131200,61,3207,4.401349072512647

What an experience!!  And this is from a loooong time Trek fan (as in seeing Star Trek TMP 7 times in the theater, ha).  The first nuTrek movie didn't really touch my heart except when Kirk was born, and Spock Prime appeared (still my #1 guy, lol), but this one grabbed me.  Now I know in this day and age big-bucks budget movies are geared toward the ""action-lovers"" crowd and maybe a few parts of this one strained my tolerance a bit (like, how many times can Kirk get hit in the face -between this movie and the 2009 one -and not get his brains addled), but overall really enjoyed it. Would go see it again but if going to spend $11 (yikes) for a movie, I want to see it more than once, lol, so will probably wait for the DVD. Maybe I'm just not jaded by all the action pictures that the usual movie goer sees these days, so thought the movie was quite tense and exciting. But I also liked the human moments that were sprinkled around the ""catch the bad guy"" plot (which was a wee bit confusing for me, but I could overlook that). This is Trek as a MOVIE!! (Altho I still love my Trek TV shows & previous movies, and hope there will be a new series soon.) Highly recommended, and props to the cast for really selling me on the characters this time. Am definitely hoping for a 3rd nuTrek movie, yes!  PS Will be getting the novelization, too, hope it's good!

Oh BTW to the critical folks who are complaining that Khan was played by a ""white guy"" in STID; well Ricardo Montalban was Caucasian! His parents immigrated from Spain to Mexico.  And anyway, didn't you notice how ""white"" Khan looked in TWOK? RM's skin was darkened in Space Seed so it wasn't that a brown skin person was actually played by a really brown skinned person in that episode.  Now, having BenedictC. play Khan in STID might be a bit of a stretch (I was cognizant of his veddy British accent watching the movie), but for me was not beyond belief, altho maybe him with a bit more of a tanned look might have been sort of helpful, lol.",1370044800,4,2169,4.260340632603406

5294850,5,B009934S5M,"J.J. Abrams really does know sci fi. Boys and Girls, Star Trek Into Darkness is excellent. The visuals, the sound, the story, and more importantly the realism to the world of Star Trek Into Darkness.  For the most part, we have the usual characters comprised of Chris Pine as Captain James Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock (he was born to play this character) , Zoe Saldana as Uhura, and Karl Urban as Bones (hilarious). They all did great. There are new additions including a very gorgeous blonde Alice Eve as Carol Marcus. But the surprise standout performance definitely goes to Benedict Cumberbatch as John Harrison or for you familar Trekkies, Khan. He has the eyes, the personality, the stance, and the voice that you would want your villan to have in this movie. I expected the sequel to be just enough to be better than the 2009 remake, but Star Trek Into Darkness took what was already good in the 2009 reboot, and made an even better sequel. I am an avid sci-fi fan, and this is one for the ages in my opinion. The story line is good. After the first 30-45 mins of the movie I thought the main focus for the movie would be Kirk to prove that he is still worthy to be called Captain, but it is not. The film goes deeper than that. But in short, It is sensationally terrific.
My closing remarks for this review will be: Star Wars Episode 7 is in excellent hands, and without a doubt, it will be great. And once again, Star Trek Into Darkness DELIVERS!!

DefiniteIy a memorable and terrifying villain (""You.... Should have let me sleep!"" crushes a mans head in his hands.). Definitely recommend it to any fans or action and sci fi films, but if you're a hardcore fans of the original series there's a chance you'll be disappointed. On a side note, some were angry with pasty skinned Cumberbatch's casting as Khan because the character is supposed to have fairly dark skinned.

5294854,2,B009934S5M,"This movie was terrible.  This is nothing more than the Transformers version of Star Trek.  Heavy on fluff, and light on substance.  JJ  Abrams is a hack who's limited bag of tricks is always evident.  He couldn't even come up with a new plot for the movie.  No, he gives us a copy of Star Trek 2.  He also manages to copy quite a few things from the last movie as well.  Kirk sleeping with an alien, more Spock tantrums, Uhura chasing after boyfriend Spock, Kirk and Pike drinking in a bar, old Spock giving advice, another scene of people flying around in the bullet shaped space suits, etc.  Oh, and the movie also sports a dozen more lens flares.  That never gets old, JJ.  Then of course you have his copying of scenes from Star Trek II.  What's a matter, JJ, can't come up with your own stuff?  Some of the things that Abarms does in these movies defy logic.  The guy hates transporters.  He looks for every possible way to avoid their use.  Why?  Who knows.  He's a freaking weirdo.  I was laughing when I saw the Klingons dropping from tethers from their ships.  LOL.  Yeah, that made a lot of sense in the 23rd century.  However, then he introduces us to long range beaming.  Huh?  Why would we need ships to get around if you can do that?  Didn't think this through very well did we?  That's okay, just insert another explosion.  Oh, well.  Another point I want to make is the characters.  Aside from Kirk being the worst captain in history, he also has very little chemistry with Spock.  Zach Quinto is a great actor and does a convincing Spock, but the relationship between the two falls flatter than a tortilla.  It's the poor writing that does them in.  How can these two possibly become this close of friends with that attitude that Kirk shows?  I wasn't buying it at all.",1369872000,,1787,4.4
5294855,3,B009934S5M,"Perhaps JJ Abrams initial reboot of Star Trek raised the bar too high, that was an outstanding film and I really had high hopes for his second take on the film series - Oh the disappointment.  The plot felt weak and rehashed with forced moments of sentimentality that just never evoked the emotional response it should have from the audience.  This felt more like a Transformers Michael Abrash affair than a Star Trek movie.

I'm going to echo the exact same complaint others have stated - why revisit any of the plot from what was arguably the best (or at least fan favorite) original Star Trek movie - The Wraith of Khan?  There wasn't any reason too - JJ Abrams initial reboot of the series made it possible to completely diverge from all the plot-lines that were previously covered in the TV series and movies.  He could have jumped into something fresh and interesting.  But he didn't....

One more comment, perhaps I'm nitpicking here, but some of the things that stand out for me the most about this film were some absolute moments of silliness for example:  Portable teleporters that ferry people away across the universe? WTF, why have spaceships at all? Then there was the Tricorder that Kirk can use from Klingon space to call Scotty in Bar - across the universe!  Seriously, somebody should have smacked the script writers in the back of the head for those two 'additions' to the franchise.  I wish the films biggest flaws were these.

That said, this was an enjoyable film, a lot of fun, and well-worth the money to see in theaters. It's accessible to those who are not steeped in the Star Trek universe and gives many nods to those of us who are.  J.J. Abrams and his team have done their homework and it shows.  They've created a worthy addition to the Star Trek legacy, have followed the rules where they needed to, and expanded on characters and plot lines where it is plausible.  (I'm thinking here of Khan and not of the Spock/Uhura thing.)  I can not comment on every nuance of the choices they've made, or if there's an obscure reference that they've misplaced (I'm sure there are some) but to those that nit-pick and insist on finding fault with details of the film, I can only quote a particular Saturday Night Live skit, from a certain starship captain: ""Get a life.""  We in the old guard need to realize that things are changing, that the torch is being past, and that to continue as a viable, living entity, we need to grow and adapt.  This film, does that well, and has learned from the mistakes of the last.  (Though I would hasten to add that that too was a marked success.)

SPOILER ALERT
--------------------------------------------------------
My only concern is the appearance of a particular member of the old cast.  I enjoyed seeing them and would very much like to see them again in the same role, but don't like implication of their use as a foil in this film.  What's the standard operating procedure - make a phone call, get advice and proceed?  There has to be a point where these kids stand on their own.

5294861,2,B009934S5M,"As a Star Trek fan, I'll go see anything in the theater that has ANYTHING to do with the franchise. That being said, I went to see the re-booted Star Trek and the new movie.

The new cast has talent, and you can see it on the screen. J.J. Adams has talent as well. So why, WHY use ST:TWOK as your plot line? Does this mean we have the possibility of the crew of the Enterprise saving the whales? If you're going to recycle ST plot lines, here's a couple of my recommendations;
Harcourt Fenton Mudd with his women and Tribbles
The planet that based their civilization on the Roaring '20s (one of my personal favorites)
""Balance of Terror"", the battle between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship
Trelane

Or, here's a thought: how about something totally different? There are countless writers out there (check the SF magazines like ANALOG & Azimovs) ready and willing to write a story that would fit into the re-booted ST.

The characters in the re-boot just seem to me to be a bit young to be handed the responsibility of a starship headed out for a five year mission.

I just have to say that I am SO GLAD that JJ Abrams had the actors all be true to the way the original characters were played--it is truly believable that these are the same characters from the original series caught up in a different time line.  They do such a great and believable job--it's truly awesome!",1369785600,6,546,4.313725490196078
5294863,4,B009934S5M,"I will qualify my review by saying I am a huge star trek fan, having seen all the series including the cartoon series and movies and owning all of them on DVD.  With that being said, did I like the new Into Darkness movie...well, yes and no.  What I did like, the special effects were great and have continued to get better with the continuation of this new reboot.  The actors in this reboot have also done well at bringing the characters to life without straying from the original intent of the characters.  I especially think that the actors who played Bones, Chekov and Scotty did an excellent job at portraying the original series actors.  The first half of the movie plot I thought was a great way to introduce Khan as the supervillian/terrorist.

But here are some of my issues with the movie and the reason why I say Yes and no to liking the movie.  I didn't like in either the first or second movie, the ongoing relationship thing with Spock and Uhura.  Call me a Trek purist or whatever, I just feel there is too much of this in the movie and doesn't really fit into Spock's character.  This half  Vulcan has too much emotion showing through at times. I can give a little on this because we are talking a young half Vulcan mind trying to deal with his emotions..but at times this is way too much.

I am still not crazy about the alternate time line thing that still hasn't been dealt with in this movie either.  Unless you totally discount all the Trek lore and history, the time line has to be fixed at some point (hmm maybe in a third movie, we can hope). Also, what the heck has the elder Spock been doing in this timeline??? Just sitting retired? I think not.

And finally, where the big let down occurred to me is the second half of the plot.  I had no issue reintroducing Khan in a way that surprises you and adds to the original story, but what let me down is where it strayed into nothing original but a retread of the original Wrath of Khan.  To me, the original Wrath of Khan was probably the best movie and story plot of the original series, Ricardo Monteblan, played an excellent Khan villain with some classic scenes and lines, and I will give the Cumberbatch credit, he played an excellent Khan as well and that is not where I have the issue.  Instead of going somewhere original with this version (like in the first half of the movie), Abrams goes back down the road of telling almost the same story as the original Khan, almost line for line at times, but with one big exception of switching roles between Kirk and Spock.  For those that have watched and enjoyed the Star Trek series and movies over the years, I hope that you understand where I am coming from.  The scenes that were considered classic in the original Khan movie seem less so here.  The classic scene where Spock dies saving the ship and the movie ending with you not knowing at the time Spock was going to come back or not was an emotional tug of war.  I remember at the time sitting in disbelief that they killed Spock.  This version had none of that emotion and had Kirk hopping back up like nothing had happened.

I don't mind a retelling of the story, especially when you tell it as well if not better than the original but in this case, I unfortunately don't feel that way.

For those that have never seen the original movies or been a fan of the series in the past and are part of the more mainstream audience then you will most likely like this story as well as any other.  I will admit as a fan of science fiction, I enjoyed the movie and is the reason for 4 stars.  But as a fan of the series, I am in an emotional tug of war.  Hmm..., almost like when I watched the original Khan.

Alas, maybe Abrams has something up his sleeve for the 3rd movie in the series to make me say Aha, so that was it.  The Trekkie in me sure hopes so.  And maybe that's what Abrams intended.",1369785600,17,3874,4.290233837689134

JJ Abrams is just lazy here, its a muddled mess that wastes some valiant efforts by some good actors.  I wish I had the 2 hours back I wasted on this.
Those of you who are wondering how this crap got the Star Trek name, here is explanation:  Rick Berman, Roddenberry's handpicked successor's contract was allowed to expire at the end of 2005/2006 under the orders of Gail Berman (no relation to Rick), who was then President of Paramount pictures before moving on. She vetted J.J. Abrams who was making a name for himself in sci-fi television and films to inherit the Star Trek franchise. It was her belief that Star Trek needed rebooting, that it was dead as a money-making intellectual property due to the poor box office returns of the last two TNG films. Abrams works with a close-knit group of writers, musicians, producers on various projects, in inheriting Star Trek, Star Trek inherited the talents, or lack thereof of his creative team, who had no previous involvement in making Star Trek. So instead of getting veteran Star Trek professionals we ended up with a bunch of newbies, which included few Trek fans, notably Robert Orci, whose grasp of Trek is weak and superficial to say the least. Orci and Kurtzman, the screenwriters on Abrams' Trek films are best known for screenwriting the Transformers films, that's whose writing Star Trek now! The Transformers films are brain-dead science fiction films that are heavy on action and visual effects, and weak on story and character development. Hence, we get Transformers quality Star Trek.",1369785600,29,1723,4.85374149659864

I liked the first reboot film and found this one good as well: Who can resist seeing Kirk trying to mediate a ""lovers' quarrel"" between Spock and Uhura in the middle of an action sequence?

Most impressively, it went the distance and made serious commentary on current events - which was relatively rare in the Trek series after TNG. ""Into Darkness"" bravely criticizes the decision to assassinate Osama Bin Laden rather than capture him and bring him to trial - and with the criticism coming from President Obama's onscreen doppelganger. It does so with fictionalized characters, but the point was clear: that's not who we want to be.

That's why sci-fi began to be taken seriously in the McCarthy era - it provided a forum to make social commentary by draping it in the guise of another time and place.

There is right-wing as well as left-wing sci-fi: while progressive sci-fi advocates going out to meet and try to understand new life forms and new civilizations, right-wing sci-fi preaches fear of even our friends and neighbors, who might have become ""pod people"" - in other words, ""commies.""

The Borg initially appeared to be Trek yielding to the pod-people narrative, except that - like the Klingon Worf - eventually some members of the Borg, like Hugh and Seven of Nine, became allies, in the classic ""quest"" narrative where the hero's compassion - and determination to treat others fairly - turns honorable opponents into friends.

My only criticism of ""Into Darkness"" was its overuse of 3D gimmicry - do we really need to be barraged over and over again with debris flying off the screen into our faces? In fact, that trick is self-defeating since the stuff just disappears as it flies off the screen, with the net effect being to call our attention to the fakery - taking us out of the picture, rather than immersing us in it.

Now that I have it in 2D I can say unreservedly that it's a great film.",1369699200,3,2096,4.741758241758242

Many people assume that you have to be a hardcore Star Trek fan in order to love this film.  I'm here to tell you that's absolutely false.  It's an easy film to watch with friends and families.  J.J. Abrams does a great job interpreting this film.  I thought the first film was great, but I loved ""Into Darkness"" even more.  I was a little skeptical at first when I found out that Cumberbatch was the villain.  Don't get me wrong, I love Cumberbatch as an actor (Sherlock Holmes), but I've only known him as a protagonist.  Boy was I wrong, he did a great job making his character (John Harrison/ Khan) believable.  He wasn't the typical cheesy villain some of us are accustomed to.

There are very few quiet moments in this movie as it is filled with plenty of chase scenes, Starfleet being attacked, and a run-in with the Klingons. If you like movies that have continuous action, with little character interaction, you will love Star Trek Into Darkness.

I would have loved to seen a bit more interplay with the characters as I wrote earlier this movie was dependent on providing an adrenalin rush for the movie viewer. There are a couple touching scenes, one where Spock does a mind meld; and another where a key character dies while trying to accomplish an impossible task. The character succeeds but pays for his actions by dying. I won't write more as this would be considered a spoiler.

One of the things I did not like was the depiction of the Klingons. The Klingons were a bit creepy and seemed a bit out of the mold for what Klingons typically look like.

Overall, this was an excellent movie, especially if you love action movies that are less dependent on character interaction.

5294874,3,B009934S5M,"I've seen ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" twice now. I don't think it's as good as the first reboot film, but it's better than I feared. And there's a massive logical flaw towards the end that probably no one besides me cares about. But I hate it.

The thing I disliked about the first film was its whole premise, the altered timeline. I don't want an alternative future developing without Vulcan. So even if the film was very good, I worried where its sequels would take us.

On that score there's no problem in this film. Sort of a reworked homage to ""The Wrath of Khan"" (also the second film in its series), it works. I especially like the revamp of a scene from the end with the roles of Kirk and Spock reversed.

There are flaws...there's no explanation for the weird landscape on Qo'noS (a supposedly deserted province is covered with buildings, albeit in ruins), the scene with actress Alice Eve in her underwear was totally unnecessary, and while Benedict Cumberbatch was great in his role, the role of Khan required either someone who looks like Ricardo Montalan or who looks like a Sikh.

But it's the logical flaw at the end that really bothers me.

(Spoiler alert)

The shoot out in space supposedly happens close to the Earth, only 280,000 kilometers away. That's closer than the Moon, so the part about the Enterprse being pulled towards the Earth after the battle works.

But there's no way that shoot out can take place so close to such a huge audience, to make any sense at all it has to be secret. At that distance, not only would the whole planet be watching, the surrounding space would be filled with ships. No way comms would be out, no way the admiral would be allowed to destroy another Federation ship, no way there wouldn't be ships and space stations helping the crashing Enterprise.

(It's a bit like there being absolutely no ships left close by when Alderaan gets destroyed. Where'd they all go?)",1369699200,4,1920,4.609970674486804
5294875,3,B009934S5M,"First off - I liked the movie and I enjoyed it.  It is like an old pair of shoes - well broken in and no surprises.  Here we find all of our old friends in new bodies - Jim Kirk, Spock, Sulu, Scotty, and all the rest.  The casting was excellent because each new actor seems to have been chosen for the resemblance to the original.  Leonard Nimoy was great as Spock but the new Spock is ever bit as good and in many ways better - but that could have been the script.  After all it takes a great actor to portray a person who essentially has no emotion, but the new Spock, like the old one - manages to act through silence, a raised eyebrow, or inflection - great job by a young man.

Of course this is a formula piece so it follows the formula and there is no surprises plot wise.  I saw this in 3D but I don't think it added anything to the film and may in some cases have detracted from it.  The set designs are good and the battle scenes drawn out for very little purpose but well done.  The sound track was bad and seemed out of place.  To the dedicated science fiction fan the film subtly pays homage to Star Wars, previous Star Trek episodes, and 2001 Space Odyssey.  Still this was a fun film and I enjoyed it.  Having said that there were a couple of things that drove me to give it 3 stars rather than 4 - nit picky things I admit.  First the script writers don't seem to be familiar with military courtesies and it annoyed me.  Kirk is outside uncovered while all the others are covered (wearing their hats), then when Spock is formally dismissed he just walks off, rather than doing an about face and marching out, and of course there were no salutes - annoying.  Then McCoy and the babe are out on a Planetoid that has a blue sky and apparently an oxygen atmosphere without any sort of protective suit. Not realistic.  Then when the artificial gravity switches on/off the people are floating but some of the debris appears to be falling - can't have it both ways.  Then the crash of the space ship at the end seemed out of proportion - yes the Enterprise is a huge ship but NOT that HUGE.  Still this is a fun film - not an academy award film - but predictable and fun.",1369699200,,2180,4.162291169451074
5294876,4,B009934S5M,"J. J. Abrams (Super 8, Alias, Fringe, Lost) has excelled in television and movies particularly resurrecting Star Trek by reinventing its essence for new audiences while respecting its origins.  In Star Trek Into Darkness, he expands on keys characters and continues his mastery of plot and non-stop action.  As summer entertainment, it is a class act and sends the science fiction/adventure series on a spectacular trajectory.  It is also the best Star Trek movie since The Wrath of Khan.

Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) are pursued by a primitive tribe on an alien planet as Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) attempts to prevent a catastrophic volcanic explosion from within.  Their activities call into the question The Prime Directive where nothing should alter a civilization from without.  In fact, Kirk's outrageous, rule-breaking behavior gets him in hot water with mentor, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and Starfleet.  At the same time, a horrifying explosion in London reveals the presence of a mysterious man (Benedict Cumberbatch) named John Harrison, who exhibits a remarkable intellect and physical prowess.  The cryptic Harrison is pursued to Kronos, home planet to the warrior race of Klingons and the threat of all out war.  Overseeing the mission directive is Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) whose presence is felt in unexpected ways.  It all leads to a revelation that threatens not only the Enterprise, but Starfleet and Earth.

As the original TV series often dealt with contemporary issues, there are strong parallels with current headlines in the form of terrorism.  In fact much of the film has a grim, dark tone as the crew must face a superior, ruthless adversary, and a couple scenes of mass destruction have a 9/11 feel.  There are a number of references to the old TV series and original Trek films as names, locales, music, and even dialogue are lifted and cleverly interjected.  Tribbles, anyone?  And you've got to love those retro uniforms especially Saldana's!

Pike and Kirk have what amounts to a father-son relationship, and this is tested in a pivotal moment.  We witness this relatively new crew as it becomes more cohesive under duress, and that is part of the fun as we watch McCoy's character and the beginnings of his amusing, trademark gripes.  There are plenty of heroics from our stars, and Scotty (Simon Pegg) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) shine in key moments.  You only wish to see if the classic trio (Kirk, Spock, and McCoy) could mix it up more, but you do see the core beginnings of their dynamic bond.  There are strong, recurring themes of loyalty and sacrifice for the good of the majority, or in other words, ""the needs of the many...""

Cumberbatch, (TVs current Sherlock Holmes) is outstanding as a powerful adversary.  Weller is particularly effective as the imposing Admiral with a hidden agenda.

The visual effects are impressively on display when the starship Enterprise explodes into warp speed and when devastating terrorist acts decimate a major city.  The pacing is quite good, so don't think too hard on credibility gaps.  Where does Harrison come from?  Anybody check his blood type?  Why is Starfleet headquarters virtually unguarded?  And what's the deal on those torpedoes?

Abrams is a master showman and he knows how to engineer cliffhangers upon cliffhangers.  The film has a memorable climax that will ring dj vu with a twist, but is nonetheless quite emotional.  It solidifies the Kirk-Spock relationship forever and could have served as one of the best endings in Trekdom, but the filmmakers chose to springboard to another exciting moment which leaves the door open for future adventures of the five year kind.  To say any more would spoil things.  A third film in this installment would be hard pressed to surpass the energy and sheer acumen he demonstrates in this sequel, but Abrams has proven he can followup a directing gig by remaining the producer with another talented director taking the reigns and still achieve spectacular results (see Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol).

I knew the names of all of the principal actors in the film and the names of the characters they were portraying, but I had done a pretty good job of shielding myself from articles containing discussions of the plot. As such, I found the film to be very entertaining and fun, and there were a couple of surprises. I will admit that a lot of the movie was predictable. In some ways, too predictable. While attempting to stay true to some historic Star Trek stories and fan favorite moments, the movie was - in some small ways - lessened. Still, there was action, aplenty, and the special effects department got everything right. The cast is just about perfect. This time around, there seemed to be a lot more cohesion and interplay between the members of the main cast, and every principal character had plenty of time in the sun and saved the day in their own way. The dialogue was 95% great. There were a few points at which I was thinking to myself ""Did they have to make it sooooo close to previous Trek movie dialogue?"" Still, most of the dialogue was witty and true to character, and the actors did a great job with it. I think they all had a lot of fun with this movie. I was especially impressed with how much more I like John Cho's Sulu characterization this time around. Benedict Cumberbatch played an AMAZING villain that you both cheer for and against. I'm sure he will have a promising future post-Star Trek.

I really enjoyed the movie, even if it had a few too many points where it tread on ground that's been trod before. J.J. Abrams continues to impress me with nearly everything he directs and produces.

5294883,3,B009934S5M,"In ""The Wrath of Khan"" when the crew of the Enterprise is hunting Khan in the nebula Spock tells Kirk that Khan shows a lack of three dimensional thinking. This is the same  shortcoming of ""Star Trek: Into Darkness.""

I had trepidations going to see ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" because I didn't like 2009's J.J. Abrams reboot of  Star Trek, but as I watched the first few minutes of the movie the hope of redemption crawled into my mind. That hope was soon dashed when I realized ""Into Darkness"" was a hatcheted up ""The Wrath of Khan"" with key characters taken directly from that movie, such as Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), along with key scenes taken directly from the movie and added to ""Into Darkness"" except that Abrams inverts the characters that were originally in the scene.

""Into Darkness"" takes the same liberties as before and violates the parameters of the characters. Spock and Uhura are `dating' and their boyfriend-girlfriend arguments intrude like a break-up between two seventh graders that at times seemed it would be more appropriate in a movie about Star Fleet Academy the high school years. In the original Star Trek, Captain James Kirk is a man of action but displays a much more intelligent character than Chris Pine's Kirk, though it is no fault of Pine's, he's just following the script and the direction of J.J. Abrams who seems to be trying to make these movies too much his material and not that of Star Trek or Gene Roddenbury.

The plot of the movie is topical. A terrorist, John Harrison, bombs a Star Fleet archive and tries to assassinate high ranking members of Star Fleet then flees to the Klingon home world of Kronos. The politics in the movie is handled more adeptly then the ham-handed way it is ""The Undiscovered Country.""

There are plot inconsistencies that start to add up and become more and more of a detracting factor as the movie progresses, such as how can a person transport from Earth across the whole galaxy to the Klingon home world, but Spock can't be transported out of an active volcano with the Enterprise in much closer proximity? Or, if you can't beam a person or two aboard the Enterprise because you can't get a transporter lock on the person(s), how is it possible to beam someone right next to them?

The cast is fine. Pine plays Kirk with less William Shatner's hamminess, Zachary Quinto is also makes a good Spock, Zoe Saldana is as hot as Nichelle Nichols was as Uhura and is given much more than Nichols ever was, Karl Urban nails McCoy and acts and looks enough like Deforrest Kelley that we believe his McCoy could age into Kelley's McCoy, and Anton Yelchin crosses over into caricature as a near hysterical Chekov.

In an alternate universe if you went to see a science fiction movie titled ""Into Darkness"" directed by J.J. Abrams without any appellation like Star Trek on it, it would probably be an OK movie although it doesn't display the imagination needed for a stand alone movie. The whole alternate reality time line of Star Trek could be used to more imaginative effect, such as it could be used to show how the world of Star Trek turned into the world shown in the Star Trek episode ""Mirror, Mirror"" which shows a Star Fleet Empire instead of a federation, but ""Into Darkness"" has already passed that possibility by. ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" needs the imprimatur of Star Trek on it to justify the budget for the movie and to bring in the crowds to make it successful. Based on J.J. Abrams either fiddling too much with the Star Trek mythology or not understanding it, it shouldn't be called Star Trek.",1369526400,10,3577,4.666666666666667

The fact that the female members (all 2 of them) were wearing miniskirts is ridiculous. My biggest beef is the ending. No continuity, no closure. One minute Spock is wailing on Khan, the next Kirk is waking up in the hospital and we are shown a sleeping Khan. How did they bring him in? He thought his crew was dead.

I can't really add much more to the other reviews suffice to say that I loved the film as a stand alone action film, but it's not Star Trek . The reason why, is I am really dissapointed that the lead charachter Khan Noonien Singh is played by a white actor. He is meant to be ""northern Indian"" and ""possibly Sikh"". Ricardo Motalban could at least pass off as this, but Cummerbach? Come on? Saying that Cummerbach is probably the best thing about it.

What will they do next? Have a white actress with a blacked up face to play Uhuru? or maybe a Korean actor play a Japanese charachter Sulu.....errrr wait :)

I also thought the villain was cliched and the script writers were lazy. When Hollywood script writers run out of ideas for a villain then they go for the cliched, English accent, posh looking English person....as they have here. Why do they seem to think that we Brits are perfect villians for Hollywood films?

Other points:

1) Starfleet - terminology and the way they act totally wrong. We're supposed to have hope for the future. ....and what's with those stupid hats they wear on parade from military uniforms?
2) Interaction between characters is messed up....it's more like a teenage vampire film dialogue.
3) Klingons look messed up....did they get affected by the time shift in the parallel Universe?
4) Earth and the look of it is not out of Rodenberry's ideal, it just looks like the 90's set in the future.
5) Enterprise internally and externally looks messed up.
6) I know this is a parallell timeline but there are inconsitencies. Somethings should be consistent with prior to the timeshift. Abrams has messed up his own rules. The Klingon bird's of prey, again look messed up.
7) There were an assortment of scenes that were stolen from other films like Godfather Part 3, Bourne Trilogy and Star Wars Pt2.

True, there are many differences, that Gene might not be so happy about. There is a greater feel of action and daring, as well as fly by the seat of your pants in JJ Abrahms Star Trek. With Gene's Star Trek, there was a greater need to think and use one's brains before brawn. Here is quite the opposite. Now don't get me wrong, I loved this movie from star to finish. But, there were things I had many issues with. I have been blasted for spoilers in the past, so I won't go into the details, but needless to say, if you are expecting Shatner's James Tiberius Kirk, you won't find him here.

I am already ordering this so that I can watch it again and again. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes the Star Trek universe (different as it may be) or just likes plain action/science fiction. *******SPOILER ALERT****** I will say that we get to see a whole new take on many aspects of the original Star Trek, for instance this movie has Khan Noonian Sing, (remember him) along with modified (yet again) Klingons.

5294890,3,B009934S5M,"My belief that J.J. Abrams can't (or won't) do original films the past few years is nothing new, and seeing his latest escapade into film making this morning did absolutely nothing to change that. My initial suspicions going into the theater proved to be right in that Abrams simply drew from past material and put a little spin and shine on some of the elements. In case it wasn't that depressingly obvious leading up to the release of the film, yes Benedict Cumberbatch actually does play Khan, with ""John Harrison"" simply being a cover. We've seen this done before recently haven't we? Just last July Christopher Nolan had Joseph Gordon Levitt go by the name of ""John Blake"" in The Dark Knight Rises before revealing that his real first name was actually in fact ""Robin."" But Abrams borrows(I'll call it that in a nice way) more than just that little nugget from Nolan. So far as I can tell, ever since the Joker allowed himself to be captured in the middle of The Dark Knight in 2008 to ultimately corrupt Harvey Dent, Star Trek Into Darkness marks the third big summer film in the past year that has attempted to mimic Nolan in this regard. Loki gets captured in The Avengers to turn the group against each other, Silva gets captured in Skyfall to attempt to assassinate M, and Khan surrenders in order to save his 72 supermen and women. Going even further, the scene near the end where the Enterprise is falling to Earth and Kirk and Scotty are running sideways on a wall in a hallway, images of the hotel fight sequence from Inception raced through my mind at warp speed.

As I mentioned before, borrowing elements from others seems to be a specialty with Abrams (the Hollywood Tarantino). The Star Trek reboot that he did in 2009 owes an enormous debt to the original Star Wars. His reasoning that if Star Trek were classical music and Star Wars was akin to Rock 'n Roll, in order to make Star Trek appealing to a present day audience, some Rock n' Roll needed to be injected, is certainly something I can understand. I would say he injected too much but that's another conversation. The same goes for Super 8. I can understand an homage to the Spielberg films of the 70's, but again it's really nothing that original or something that hasn't been seen before, (as far as I'm concerned) and therefore not all that interesting or memorable. Star Trek Into Darkness borrows many elements from both The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek: Nemesis and if you've seen both they should be pretty obvious. I will say Cumberbatch did a decent job even though he wasn't given a whole lot to do and was underused in my opinion. Some of his facial expressions made me think he would have made a far better Voldemort than Ralph Fiennes was. A few reverses, primarily Kirk sacrificing himself to save the ship rather than Spock and Spock fighting Khan rather than Kirk (if you've seen the original Space Seed episode) did virtually nothing for me. Even Spock yelling Khan's name out loud in a rage (as William Shatner famously did) turned a rather somber moment into an extremely corny one, akin to Darth Vader yelling ""no"" at the end of Revenge of the Sith (and Return of the Jedi if you own the Blu Ray). Thankfully Kirk's body was not shot into the Genesis planet and we will not have to suffer through ""The Search for Kirk"" 3 or 4 years from now.

But what I groaned about the loudest, more so than any of the previous things listed, was this insistence to essentially turn Khan into a terrorist. Even though the word ""terrorist"" is never mentioned once in the entire film (""one man war"" is used instead), the fact that he is behind a bombing that takes place in London (July, 2005 ring a bell?) and pilots an enormous starship into a bunch of skyscrapers should say enough. Interestingly, the word ""Arabic"" does get mentioned though in an argument between Kirk and Spock, with Kirk citing ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" in a positive way to justify his forth coming actions and Spock  flipping it around to reveal the negative reality. Funnily enough the fact that the phrase has an identical Chinese origin is never mentioned. But getting back to Khan, he isn't really the primary villain of the film is he? It just so happens to be the commander of Starfleet, who for whatever reason feels a war with the Klingons is inevitable and is just looking for some excuse to provoke a conflict. Sound familiar? I suppose if you rolled up Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rove, and George Tenet into one you would get Admiral Marcus, but isn't it long past the time for finger pointing now? I had sincerely hoped that after Bin Laden had been found and killed in 2011 this so called ""War on Terror"" would finally come to an end and we could finally put that entire mess behind us and move on. Obviously a film had to be made chronicling as much as possible and earlier this year Zero Dark Thirty came out. And that was it, reflection period over,time to move on. Right? Apparently not. Given the recent bombings in Boston,this terrorist thing is still not yet over with and goes on in another form. If anything the Boston bombings have brought a new, fresh sense of fear to Americans. Let me provide you with an immediate example. Early this morning I had planned to see the film (in 2D, I hate Stereoscopic) at the first showing at 10am. I do not have a car so I always walk whenever I see something at the Bow Tie in Richmond. I had brought my backpack with me containing only my most recent paycheck (I went to the bank afterwards) and a Red box copy of The Bourne Legacy (which sucked in its own right). Upon reaching the theater I was immediately turned down by the person manning the ticket booth, saying the theater had a no backpack policy. Now I've taken my backpack to that theater off and on in the past 4 years whenever I feel I'll need to save my seat so this was a new thing. Security wouldn't even hold it for me. So, since I had no car, I had to turn around, walk back to my apartment (1.8 miles), leave my backpack there, and walk back to catch the next showing at 11:20. It didn't need to be said, but given that the two Boston bombing suspects carried the bombs around in backpacks......well. Thinking about it a little more I suppose the word ""caution"" not ""fear"" would be more appropriate, but then again there has to be a certain amount of fear present in order to initiate caution, so they basically walk hand in hand more or less. Not to mention the overly excessive amount of force used to find the one living suspect, if anything, shows that after 10 years of hunting Bin Laden we haven't learned a whole lot about going after people who've done us harm. Even at the end of the movie, a special thanks is given to the post 9/11 people protecting us.

Obviously this film was written and shot many, many months before the bombings took place. It's a common thing for Star Trek films to have some sort of social commentary on the current present, and again I'm still annoyed Abrams chose to talk about terrorism. The fact that the bombings took place after the film was shot but before it was released will make it so that the film shall reinforce the need for caution in the wake of new domestic incidents. T.V. episodes of Hannibal, Castle, and Family Guy were pulled due to sensitive subject matter right after the bombings happened, but I guess its too much to ask a studio to push back one of their summer releases, like they did with Gangster Squad last July after the shootings in Aurora, Colorado. I guess Star Trek was too big and important a film for something like that (Gangster Squad didn't do so well financially).

In closing, it seems that Abrams has successfully evolved from a film maker into a plastic surgeon, with the ability to dissect something old and worn out and make it feel and look new and shiny, grossing hundreds of millions of dollars as a bonus. I can see now why he was so heavily, secretly coveted to helm the new Star Wars film coming out in '15 for the growing corporate empire known as Disney. It wouldn't surprise me at all if he drew from past Star Wars material for the new film and put a personal spin on it like he did with Star Trek. We'll see. Time will tell.

5294893,4,B009934S5M,"""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" manages to be several entertaining movies at once. It is first a very exciting action movie with lots of excellent special effects that should hold the viewer's interest from start to finish. Second, it is a well-done prequel to the earlier Star Trek movies and even the television series. We get to meet the crew of the Starship Enterprise before that five year mission of exploration. The actors who portray the main characters at a younger age should be instantly recognizable to generations of Star Trek fans. Third, the movie is a fairly clever remix of familiar story elements that pays homage but is not a slavish imitation of those earlier stories. The movie succeeds particularly well in exploring the interactions of the main characters, and in rebooting the most famous villain of the Star Trek series.

The movie begins with an extended action sequence on a distant world, where Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) has once again exceeded his guidance and put his crew and ship at risk. Kirk gets out of it by violating rules and directives, and finds himself demoted, and separated from Spock (Zachary Quinto), when he returns to Earth. The actions of a vengeful Starfleet officer named John Harrison (a superb Benedict Cumberbatch) create a new crisis seemingly tailor-made for Kirk's talents. He is restored to command and sent after the bad guy, who is hiding out on the edge of the Klingon part of the galaxy.

Harrison turns out to have a surprising agenda and equally surprising enemies; he and Kirk must be uncertain allies for a time. But the audience knows there will eventually be a confrontation, one so serious that Kirk, Spock, and the crew of Enterprise will be tested to their limits. This movie is great fun, and highly recommended.",1369440000,,1787,4.875
5294894,3,B009934S5M,"Let me also add that I was very excited to see this film. I loved how J.J. had the first one fast paced, heartfelt, funny and enveloping.  I wouldn't use any of those adjectives to describe this one.  I've seen every J.J. film and I think this is his worst yet.  I think J.J. blew his load on the first and now he's got this franchise by the wheel and wants to stretch it.  The whole film lacked substance, and that showed early on in the opening sequence with Bones and Kirk.  I didn't understand mostly why it seemed to keep all the favorite characters always separated. First Spock, then Scotty, Spock reunites, then Checkov, Uhura and on and on. What the first one had is these strong and different characters thrown together in a motley crew, and had great arguments and drama.
Secondly, the villain lacked some authenticity that would've made you believe he was smarter than the enterprise crew (like we're supposed to believe the accent is a gauge).  I can't say if that is the actor's fault, but seeing Benedict in this one reminds me of how understated Eric Bana's acting was as Nero.  For the record, Nero was crazy which isn't necessarily better or worse, but perhaps the plot in the 1st made crazy ""scarier"" than the plot in this one enabled smart.",1369440000,7,1260,4.524229074889868
5294895,5,B009934S5M,"I'm old enough to remember the original Star Trek series, and I have a deep affection for it despite its obvious flaws. I was ready to despise this latest reboot when Star Trek was released in 2009, but some terrific choices were made and I left the theater grinning. I was delighted with the casting choices four years ago, and how this new version of Star Trek gave enough nods to the original without going over the top.

So, I have been anticipating the release of Star Trek Into Darkness ever since the credits rolled on the last entry. I was not disappointed.

What do you want from a Star Trek movie? The world has changed over the past 45 years, and action is an essential element of any science fiction movie. Special effects rule, and the budget can be enormous for proven franchises that simply can't fail at the box office. There is certainly no lack of action in this movie, and it doesn't waste any time in surfacing. Kirk and some of the crew are shown fleeing the inhabitants of a primitive planet, after trying to prevent a volcano from destroying it. The fast cuts look like something out of a Bourne movie, and provide the first adrenaline rush. There are no shortage of similar moments over the remaining two hours.

While I loved Star Trek (2009), it was pretty light on story. It served as a vehicle to introduce the new crew, and did so splendidly, but the actual story wasn't particularly memorable. That's not to say that it wasn't tremendously enjoyable. What Into Darkness does is develop on that strong foundation. We learn more about the characters, and what binds them together, but this time we're also given a story with more depth.

The story is built around the hunt for John Harrison, who is a man that seems out to destroy the Federation. Who is he? What are his motivations? Needless to say, Kirk is given the task of tracking him with the Enterprise and her crew. Expect chase scenes, fights, battles, and all the special effects you could possibly desire. It's what you won't expect that will make you smile most of all. The theme of family is used in various forms, as well as revenge and the lust for power.

The great thing about this reboot is that, thanks to a plot device in the previous movie, anything can happen to the characters we know and love. Part of the fun is recognizing events and people that you know from other versions of the franchise, and seeing where their story deviates from the one you expect. Into Darkness introduces a couple of characters that you'll know, if you remember your Star Trek history. I wouldn't dream of ruining that surprise for you, so I'll leave it at that. You'll also an encounter an alien race that you might be familiar with.

I've mentioned that the movie is action-packed. Its budget also means that the effects are superb. But don't make the mistake of thinking that Into Darkness is all action and no substance. There are several exchanges of dialogue which create genuine emotion. This cast can act. One example takes place in a bar between Pike and Kirk, and it's an excellent example of key characters forming a bond.

My only disappointment with the 2009 movie is that Simon Pegg didn't seem like the best choice to play Scotty, but he won me over this time. My only criticism of the movie is that some of the key characters don't get enough screen time, but I am sure they will all have their moments to shine in future entries in the series. As with the original series, the relationships between Kirk, Spock and McCoy are vital, and I think all three actors do a great job portraying them. However, it's also wonderful to see characters like Uhura with more significant roles.

There's really no way to explain the plot without giving away too much. If you enjoyed the first reboot, and like these actors, there's a strong chance that you will love Star Trek Into Darkness. It seemed to last about an hour, but had enough content for four hours. That's meant as a compliment. You won't see anyone washing dishes for 20 minutes in this movie.

Where will the franchise go next? I hope that it is a long and glorious journey. I would happily watch another five movies with this crew, and can only hope that there won't be a four-year gap between them.

Go and see this movie if you care about Star Trek in any way, because you'll have a lot of fun. Oh, and be prepared to see more lens flares. They are apparently here to stay.

Overall score 4.5/5

This is the first movie I have seen in theaters since Roger Ebert's passing. Normally I would head over to his site to see whether his opinion was close to mine. It seems very strange not having that option.",1369440000,12,4655,4.5219976218787155
5294896,5,B009934S5M,"Without spoiling the big thing about the villain, I cannot specify what is derivative about it, except to say that several moments in the film are pretty blatantly derived from other Star Trek films.  Despite this, it doesn't at all interfere with the film and its storytelling as a whole (save for one moment involving Spock's scream near the end.  I couldn't not burst out laughing).

Despite the derivations along those lines, the film makes the story and characters its own, as well as beautifully altering certain character's personalities based on the alternate universe events, while maintaining their original Star Trek personalities (particularly with the villain).

Some action scenes border on the gratuitous, but even in those (such as the one with the Klingons), its purpose serves the plot (in demonstrating the villain, particularly when Kirk starts punching him).  About the only thing that stood out as pointless was having Carol Marcus (played by Alice Eve) strip to her underwear while changing into an environment suit.  At the very least, she told Kirk to look away, and the shot we get is when he looks anyway.  Gratuitous, yes, but a far stretch to call it misogynistic.

I would certainly rate this above First Contact, but not sure if it reaches to the level of Wrath of Khan.",1369440000,7,1301,4.9631336405529956

Good acting, good plot, great special effects!!
If you are an old time Star Trek fan ( I used to hurry home to watch Star Trek and Voyage to the Bottom Sea, when in grade school) and you want more of the same, then this movie is probably not for you. Stay home and live in the past. That's ok. I understand. I collect DVD's and have many black and whites, as well as color films, from my past, and I love them!! I collect DVD's and Blu- Rays. I have over 700, so far.
But if you are willing to ""Go where no one has gone before"" then get this movie!!! JJ Abrams rocks!!! Best Sci Fi action adventure flick ever made, so far.
I embrace the present and the future of movie making. I enjoy remembering my past ( I own all the past Star Trek DVD's) but I am always ready to embrace my present and future.
But if you want to remember the past and have difficulty embracing the present and future of movie making, then this may not be a movie for you.
It's true that JJ Abrams has updated and given Star Trek a new feel, so to speak. But that is what movies are all about these days. Life has moved forward! Technology has moved forward! And so have movies!!
Embrace it and enjoy it!
My wife and I go to movies to escape and get away from it all. And we love a movie that knocks our socks off!! And this movie is it!!
My wife is a big fan of ""Iron Man, Avengers, Thor, Transformers,"" but when we left the theater after seeing this movie, we went and got tickets and saw it again, right away!!!
She looked at me and said ""You know, I think I love this better than ""Iron Man""!!

Abrams has kept the integrity of the TOS & the 80's films intact, some liberties were taken with the Klingons, but not by much, if you have seen ""Enterprise's"" 4th season, then the Klingon's appearance won't be too surprising, there isn't much I can say that others haven't already said, except to say that everyone portrays these classic characters to perfection, Leonard Nimoy's cameo was great, Alice Eve definately looks like a younger Carol Marcus no doubt, Benedict Cumbarach definately has a famous villian's mannerism down, Karl Urban definately reminds you of McCoy, & Kirk & Spock are in perfect form, I was convinced this time that Chris Pine was a younger William Shatner, the brash charm was there, I was a bit disappointed that him & Carol Marcus didn't flirt more, after all they are destined to be lovers & the parents of David as seen in ""Star Trek II-Wrath of Kahn"", but then again the pacing of this one didn't allow a romance to blossom, even though it is an alternate reality, the attraction would still be there, overall, this one I think is the best one since ""The Wrath of Kahn"", maybe even better, somthing I thought I would never hear myself say, despite being an alternate reality, the ending defiantely seems to predate elements of the 60's show & 80's films as if there is no alternate reality, which surprised me, overall, this one is one of the best ""Trek"" films ever made.",1369353600,9,1554,4.675182481751825

You need not be a lifelong fan to enjoy this spectacular roller coaster ride of a movie but if you are, you will enjoy it... O-SO-MUCH-BETTER! The inferences & nods to past TV episodes & the early movies of the 80's are in of themselves so richly rewarding. You will find yourself unable to control your smiling as you discover the creativeness of the writing, as the originality of the story keeps that 'alternate reality' concept going. This film is one of the most enjoyable films to come out in a long, long time. It is thoroughly entertaining. The audience I saw it with stood up and clapped. When was the last time you experienced that in a movie theater? As previously stated 'STID' propels you on a non stop roller coaster ride but also has a great deal of heart as well. The friendship dynamic between Spock & Kirk is further developed in a really great, dramatic way. Some reviewers poo-pooed the character traits of all the beloved crew as being tired & predictable. However, as a Star Trek fan, isn't that what we've come to expect? In fact a true fan would be truly disappointed if Scotty & McCoy did not behave accordingly. A major surprise awaits and is done in such a subtle unexpected manner that you never see it coming. That's all I'll say on that or I'll have to be indited for being a huge spoiler. There are a ton of special F/X but they are done well and are not over bearing, in fact they add & give the movie it's richness. I met Gene Roddenberry when I was in college and was in awe of the man. I know in my heart that he would be very proud of this handling of his brain-child. Kudos to J.J. Abrams, Kurtzman & Orci for the respect and dignity they continue to give this much loved story & the characters who inhabit the world of Star Trek. Chris Pine & Zachary Quinto shine. Benedict Cumberbatch is truly one of the best villains to come along in years. His malevolence & charm are a wonder to behold.

5294906,5,B009934S5M,"Until this morning, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was always the gold standard for the entire Star Trek movie series in my humble opinion.  When I first heard that Benedict Cumberbatch was going to be in the new Star Trek movie, I thought that he did a wonderful job in Sherlock but what can he add to the Star Trek saga aside from the fact that he and Leonard Nimoy have ties to Bilbo Baggins.  Perhaps Gollum would make a surprise appearance with Bilbo and Spock will sing the Ballad of Bilbo Baggins.  So I was very hesitant when I went to see this movie and boy....I was so very wrong!!  Star Trek Into Darkness is now the new gold standard for the entire Star Trek series.

The story was fast paced and kept the audiences attention in our theater.  My wife, who has absolutely no knowledge about Star Trek, really enjoyed watching the movie so much so that she wants to see the prior Star Trek movie.  As for me, I thought the movie excelled because of Benedict Cumberbatch as ""John Harrison"".  In several scenes, you could actually hear people gasping at what Mr. Cumberbatch was doing on the screen.  He would suddenly appear or do something so shocking that you would be jumping out of your seat.  In the end, you could actually believe that he is a superior being capable of outwitting the entire Federation.  His performance alone was well worth the price of a ticket.

Also it was great to see Peter Weller back on the screen again.  I hope he will do more movies in the future and step away from academia for a bit.

By the time the movie was finished, people were actually giving the movie a standing ovation.  JJ Abrams has outdone himself in re-making the new Star Trek series and is truly the heir apparent of Nicholas Meyer in the action/suspense department.",1369353600,8,1777,4.458204334365325

5294908,5,B009934S5M,"JJ Abrams reboot of Star Trek in 2009 breathed new life into a franchise which CBS had given up on and which Paramount seemed non-committal to in it's present form. The result was a film which seemed to please current fans, but which brought in a new fan base (younger movie goers and overseas audiences), making ""Star Trek"" the highest grossing movie in franchise history.

That bit of magic gave Paramount the balls to try a sequel with the new cast and gave Abrams some bit of clout - resulting in an IMAX presentation of the film as well as 3D.

Because of the reboots appeal with new audiences - particularly overseas (where Star Trek has historically performed very poorly), the studio wanted to insure a wide appeal to justify the largest budget ever for a Star Trek film.  Focus groups were shown cut after cut of the film to give every beat of the movie the maximum appeal to audiences.

The result is a Star Trek which is unparalleled in terms of being a very deliberately engineered product. The movie is clearly designed as a big budget event movie, more than it is a ""Star Trek"" movie. Removed or thickly veiled are many of the elements of previous Star Trek incarnations: literary references, idealistic ideologies and existential themes. Instead, it tries to satisfy fans with Star Trek references that might not be easily identified by ""newbies."" For instance, they reference Section 31 - a plot element from the Deep Space 9 series and as far as I know, doesn't appear in any of the other series. They introduce the character Carol Marcus - which is significant if you've seen The Wrath of Khan a million times and recognize her as the mother of Captain Kirk's son David. There is also a quick discussion about the Prime Directive and then that's pretty much the end of Star Trek culture outside of costuming.

So, given that the movie is a product, more than any other Star Trek to date, the questions become: Is the movie any good? and Is this a good Star Trek movie? I have to say yes on both counts.

This movie breaks the warp barrier in terms of action. 2009's Star Trek had more action than any Star Trek to date. This one starts at a run (literally) and the viewer has to work to catch up the whole show. Some in my family felt like the movie was moving so fast it was hard to catch all of what was going on. I didn't feel like that myself, but I can see their point.

The Trek archetypal characterizations are really well performed by the cast and I really enjoyed the interaction between the characters. Additionally, the screenwriters have done a good job constructing dialog which feels true to each character.  There's plenty of humor here, but maybe not as much as the last film - there's just no room/time for joking around.

The plot revolves around a terrorist attack which spurs Starfleet brass to mount an assassination attempt. Kirk fights with his feelings for revenge and as the plot unfolds, interesting conspiracies arise.

The emotional component of the film is another strength of the film. Characters are given emotional motivations and the stakes are high - both for earth and Starfleet, but also for the Enterprise crew. All the cast get a nice emotional beat in the film, though Chekov probably gets slighted a little bit.

There are obvious references to the best of all previous Star Trek films which are handled expertly - familiar but wholly new. I loved the obvious tribute to the previous films as well as the new perspective from the eyes of this parallel universe crew.

The thing I have always loved about Star Trek, in all it's incarnations, is the bond between the crew. That bond of friendship is at the heart of Star Trek Into Darkness and is the movies greatest success.",1369353600,6,3731,4.610859728506787
5294909,1,B009934S5M,"Its one thing to use a nifty device (timeline change) to avoid troubling questions of continuity inherent in recreating a franchise with millions of fanatical followers who would go nuts about every error.  Its quite another to be too lazy to do the research to avoid conflicts with things that inexplicably become changed BEFORE the timeline change occurred.  Listing the large numbers of those will be left to true Trek fans.

As a movie, the modern elements are there;  big special effects and car chases.  As STAR TREK, only the most superficial elements are there;  phasers and transporters.  Despite a superb cast, especially the villain, what's missing is what makes Star Trek STAR TREK!  That thing is Story!  The big ORIGINAL idea!

Ok, there's some nostalgia in bringing back a true Trek villain, a similar but different incarnation.  But it was done better the first time.  And when you wait years for a feature film you expect a higher standard to be met.  It was story, concept, cognitive stimulation that made STAR TREK the most successful television franchise ever, that inspired generations of scientists, that brought us back by the millions wanting more.  None of that is in this movie!  If it can be done in a weekly TV series certainly it can be done in a big-budget feature film.  They didn't even try.  I wanted ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" and they brought me ""Fast and Furious 87"".

Anyone could enjoy this movie.  But who was emotionally moved by this movie?  Who was inspired to change their future?  Who was introduced to a concept that made them THINK??

Those emotional parts are what brings this movie up to deserving five stars. There was little I had a problem with aside from the pointless underwear scene from Alice Eve, and maybe Spock's ridiculous yell. I admit that the plot was a little confusing, though watching it multiple times clears that up. As far as paying fan service, I loved the way that they reversed the roles and mimicked TWOK! While a lot of people found it to be a cheap rip-off, I thought it was done really well and played off mostly of Spock's story arc for a strong emotional scene. There are a lot of people who say there are plot holes, particularly with the science, such as, why is the enterprise under water and not in orbit? Remember this is a science fiction movie, so you can makeup details to explain all of it away. Roberto Orci did when a fan asked and he said that there were asteroids in orbit so the ship couldn't stay up there and had to be underwater to get the best readings of the volcano because of magnetic interference. See? Not a big deal! The movie was very entertaining and Benedict Cumberbatch does an AMAZING job! I know his character scared me! I think this film is much better than Star Trek 2009.",1369353600,13,1395,4.38996138996139
5294911,2,B009934S5M,"I have to admit, going into the theater to see this movie, I had really high expectations after the first JJ Abrams  Star Trek movie, but I was sadly disappointed.  The plot is recycled and almost too suspenseful for its own good.  I understand suspense is a crucial part of these films, but the way it was handled here is just too heavy handed.  Adding to that, we have the ""terrorist"" theme of the film, which although it is timely, doesn't exactly fit into the Star Trek universe evenly.  Without giving up spoilers, I have to say I was not pleased by the blunt way in which the conflict between the ""us"" and ""them"" was handled.  I had hoped for at least a little more than the scant hint of moral ambiguity which the film offered.  All of this combined makes for an unfortunately uninteresting attempt by J.J. Abrams.

All plot points aside the only reason this film doesn't get a 1 star review from me would be the fleeting moments of brilliance in cinematography.  Some of the shots are simply beautiful.  They're well composed, striking, and memorable.  While the whole film isn't so impressive in that respect, there are moments where I found myself genuinely in awe of the actual pictures on the screen.  The CGI is of course amazing, as you would expect from a big budget studio film, and it's made extra interesting in 3D.  The film's length and blunt story telling are too much to overcome, and while the film is plenty ""cool"" and ""neat looking,"" it's simply too long and pandering for me.",1369353600,12,1501,4.5559701492537314

They took a key scene from ST2 and repeated it. That was bad because 1. They just repeated what'd been done! 2. I did not for a second believe Kirk was going to die (at least the old ST2 let Spock die and made it very interesting in ST3 to bring him back).  3. I saw from a mile away how they were going to revive Kirk. The foreshadowing was not even subtle. 4. Spock's ""Khan~~~~!"" was pure self-parody, I couldn't help laughing.

Before Pike died, Spock went and had a mind-meld with him without asking for permission. I thought some revelation would come out of this, but it turned out all Spock learned was the ""fear"" one feels before one dies. This makes Spock a voyeuristic jerk.

The rest of it is just non-stop mindless action. They don't even try to imitate the original ST characters anymore. Spock is supposed to be endearing, not annoying: ""I have a few attitudes...."" that's just lame.",1369267200,30,919,4.420118343195266

5294918,4,B009934S5M,"I'll say up front: There are spoilers in this review. If you haven't seen the movie yet and plan to, don't read any further.

Those who don't mind extra background info before they go to the theater, read on:

""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is not a perfect film. But for pure viewing enjoyment it's still, in my opinion, the third-best of the 12 films in the series, up there with ""Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home"" and ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan."" Given the spotty track record of the series overall, you can take that comment as you will.

What's good:
* The first 20 minutes are among the best opening of any ST film.
* The interaction among the ensemble clearly carries the film and keeps it from bogging down. It's obvious that this cast really gets along and has looked forward to doing another movie together.
* Benedict Cumberbatch's villain, ""John Harrison"" (a.k.a. the legendary ""Khan""), is a perfect foil for Kirk -- and later, Spock. Peter Weller's Admiral Marcus gets a good runner-up award.
* Zoe Saldana has become THE Uhura. Nichelle Nichols must be asking herself, ""What if...?""
* There's a good interweaving of the original Star Trek series episode ""Space Seed,"" and ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan,"" with a touch of ""Star Trek 6: The Undiscovered Country,"" and the 1986 Diane Carey ST novel ""Dreadnought!""
* Various references to events and characters from the original series, sprinkled throughout the film in an almost ""Where's Waldo?"" motion for fans.
* Seeing Kirk being called on the carpet by Admiral Pike for his recklessness, and watching him grow up on screen as events unfold. Nice work, Chris Pine.

What's not so good:
* Timeline continuity issues, such as the crew's journey to the Klingon world of Kronos, where you see a partially destroyed moon orbiting the planet. The accident that caused this destruction took place in Star Trek 6, about 25 years after the ""Space Seed"" episode. Or the references to the tribbles and the ""Mudd incident,"" which took place in the series a year or two after this film's present time.
* Believability: The Enterprise underwater like a giant sub? Spock in an all-out brawl with Khan, and emerging without a scratch (Kirk, on the other hand, has quite a few scrapes he carries through the entire film)? A space station orbiting Jupiter that no one sees? And no one, other than the original Spock, has any memory or knowledge of who Khan is/was?
* Numerous plot holes, some big enough to drive a starship through. Among the biggest offenders: handheld communicators that can call from the Neutral Zone all the way to Earth (a feat not even possible in the ""Next Generation"" series about 80 years later), but can't reach the orbiting Enterprise during a volcanic explosion; Dr. McCoy's statement about needing Khan's blood to save Kirk's life, when he has 72 other persons with the same blood in his medical lab; the same Dr. McCoy saying that he can't remove someone from a cryotube without killing him, but later taking someone out of one of those tubes and telling his assistants to just ""keep him in a medically induced coma""; Khan getting stunned once with a phaser and going down, unconscious, but later getting hit several times point blank and he's not even dazed; Carol Marcus has a British accent, while dad Admiral Marcus doesn't; a tribble sitting on Dr. McCoy's desk, that somehow doesn't move despite the fact the Enterprise has been tossed around like a rag doll; a security officer who doesn't know what a communicator is, or what a countdown is (""10, 9, 8..."")...I could go on, but you get the idea.
* The Federation, thanks to the original Mr. Spock in the last movie, has the technology for long-distance teleportation. Yet the Enterprise isn't using it; but the villains are.
* The Enterprise has obviously had an upgrade: In some respects, it's more technologically advanced than the Enterprise of the Next Generation series and movies.

Judgment call:
* Replaying the ST2 death scene between Kirk and Spock, with the roles reversed: Kirk dying in the radiation chamber after saving the ship; Spock on the outside, in anguish. I thought it was a fine homage to the original; others may consider the word-for-word scene remake is merely lazy scriptwriting.
* Reviving Kirk about 20 minutes after his death. This is a universe with an alternate timeline. Imagine what could have been from this point with Spock (or someone else) permanently in the captain's chair?
* The ""gratuitous"" scenes of Dr. Marcus and Captain Kirk in their underwear (at different times), which do nothing to forward the plot (but obviously kept certain people interested).

Overall: A worthwhile film, if you look past the flaws. You just wonder what they're going to do now that the crew is officially on its ""five year mission to go where no one has gone before."" Maybe...the Mirror Universe?",1369267200,8,4850,4.795454545454546
5294919,5,B009934S5M,"Star Trek 2 was awesome and spectacular, but close to its original of Star Trek (2009).

The cast especially Cumberbatch as Khan, was awesome, funny and brutally serious.

Action is fun to watch, it always makes sure humor and emotion is involved

5294920,5,B009934S5M,"As a casual viewer, I don't dare nitpick or overanalyze anything related to the Star Trek universe. I enjoy it for what it is, and I am completely hooked. I was in love with the reboot when it came out in 2009 and this sequel was so worth the wait. As far as I know it still takes place in the alternate time-line so liberties were taken and new events can take place because of it. This is a fast-paced action film, but it is also a film about friendship, and forging bonds. It really is all about Spock and Kirk and they couldn't have done it better than this. Zachary Quinto is simply extraordinary in this. He stays perfectly in character, no matter the situation. His professional relationship with Kirk is just amusing to witness simply for the fact that they are polar opposites. They bicker, disagree on almost everything and yet you can see the evolvement of both their character's throughout the movie. When they are on screen together, you know you are in for a treat, even when the unexpected happens and the most subtle scene becomes the most poignant. The rest of the cast is top-notch as well, with a few characters getting less screen time than the first, but understandable for this particular film. However, it is Benedict Cumberbatch that absolutely steals the film. You can't take your eyes off of him. His voice, so dark and full of promise, so elegant, with a touch of crazy. He is perfect and I hope to see much more from him in future films.

Let's talk about the score. It's fantastic. Very rarely do I lose concentration during a fight scene to admire the music, but here it happens quite often. Just a great, effective musical score. The special effects/CGI are all done to perfection. As somone who IS picky about that, I can say I don't have any complaints regarding the production value of Into Darkness. I can't wait for the Blue-ray. If it looked that great on the big screen, I look forward to seeing how it looks with perfect clarity in my living room. Star Trek Into Darkness is a great film for those not really into Star Trek. I didn't think I would care much for the reboot, as I'm not a huge sci-fi fan. But I was hooked from the first scenes, and now, I am completely open to watching the original films as well.

It is a good sci-fi, action film that is well made. If you want to analyze it and compare it start with this... It is a different timeline and all the characters lives were shaped differently and everything else, from Starfleet to the Klingons is different. THERE IS NO COMPARISON. Science dictates that in an alternate timeline different choices would be made thereby changing that reality and thus affecting everything in it.

There are a couple of minor surprises, and the acting and special effects are top notch, but the plot details are ridiculous.

I greatly enjoyed seeing this in the theater... Not as much as the first J.J. Abrams reboot movie, which was just so dynamic and clean, but still a lot. I like what these guys are doing with the characters, with the ground-level view of the formative years of the Federation, and in particular with the concept of this being an alternate-reality Star Trek universe.

The concept was introduced at the end of the first film, and even though I knew this, and consciously reminded myself of it before going into this second film, I still found myself halfway through the movie thinking, ""oh, thus-and-such can't happen, since it doesn't fit the continuity"" or ""I wonder how they're going to change that back so it'll fit in with what we know happens later..."" and it wasn't until way, way far in that I realized that this version of Star Trek is going to be a lot different than the ""reality"" we already know. It's a really profound divergence, and they are having a lot of fun with it. Me, too.

We all left the theater psyched and ready for more: if the movie theater production schedule proves too ponderous, I sure hope they'll consider keeping this cast and crew together for a TV series. They're all doing great work, with a special shout-out to Zachary Quinto, who has definitively made the new-universe Spock his own. Great stuff. Bring on Number Three!

5294925,5,B009934S5M,"I have been a Star Trek fan all my life.. but with the last 6 movies I've had enough of Star Trek forever until Mr. ""genius"" Abrams reimagined it from a better perspective.  Its not about who is smarter than the villain, Spock, Scotty, or Kirk its about who has the best gadgets and the best hard bodies.. Even the oyster face man was hilarious. One word: Star Trek Into the darkness is badar^&^e.

One of the reasons Star Trek died in the 90's is because the cast became aged. Star Trek is for young people and it made me feel young again. This Star Trek got a huge face lift and I love it (complete with toys and all). To be honest about what killed it for me in the 90's was the constant Klingon crap.

The part where Abrams introduces a super Enterprise is just jaw dropping. I was all over that saying holy cow Star Fleet Admiral kicks butt. He pawned Kirk! I totally enjoyed seeing Captain Kirk get all teary-eyed begging the Admiral for another chance.

There is a scene where the Admirals daughter pops into the picture and you say is that her????? Then you all of a sudden remember Kirk had a son.

The love affairs with the O-hoorah was funny, and the new Kirk makes fun of it- which elicites a laugh from me. I need laughs from ST.

I must say the ending was a shocker... no wonder Kirk was superior.

I'm preordering 3d/Blu-ray, DVD, digital.. right now.  I can't wait for this to get on my private big screen in 3d.  I hope ST3 will explain the rest of Kirk's early life.",1369180800,6,1484,4.252669039145908
5294926,5,B009934S5M,"I wasn't sure that J.J. Abrams and his crew would be able to pull off another success with this franchise.  The 2009 Star Trek reboot was a surprise hit with audiences and critics that no one really saw coming.  When I first saw the trailer for that film I thought I was looking at a last desperate attempt to make Star Trek relevant.  Much to my surprise I ended up applauding at the end of the reboot.  It was fast paced, well-acted, and visually extraordinary- the most entertaining space opera to hit the big screens since the original Star Wars trilogy.  More importantly, it managed to breathe new life into the Star Trek franchise.  Trek was cool, and except for some Trek purists out there, everyone applauded the film.

Now 4 years have passed.  There is now a high expectation on a Trek film that was not placed on the 09 entry.  I had my doubts.  Star Trek 2009 was a surprise; a great blockbuster that few saw coming.  Into Darkness rides in four years later and had to meet expectations set by the 09 film...And it did!

Star Trek Into Darkness is what a quality summer blockbuster and sequel should be.  It doesn't slow itself down at any points and gets straight to what the audience cares about.  Character development and interactions are handled in such a way that the film never gets boring, and the narrative moves forward without many stalls.  At times I found myself on the edge of the seat, and throughout the entire film I legitimately felt for the characters and wanted to know how the conflict would be resolved.  This movie knows how to take a basic plot and transform it into Grade-A entertainment.

We cannot address Into Darkness without discussing its villain.  Many complained about the blue collar villain Nero in the '09 Trek (I personally enjoyed him, but the masses have spoken) and we do get a vastly superior antagonist in the form of Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock).  Cumberbatch is a menacing, physically imposing, charismatic figure who easily dominates every scene he appears on screen for.  In other words: everything Nero was not.  Although I think some Trek purists may complain about this character for spoiler related matters I think most viewers will just accept him for the outstanding performance.

The only  fault I can think of is that the film isn't any larger in scale than the previous...In fact, given the last one's villain was destroying entire planets, Into Darkness may be somewhat of a step back in scale.  But this movie didn't need to be like The Dark Knight where each film raises the stakes.  As a continuation of a long running franchise Into Darkness is exciting, has genuine humor, suspense, visual spectacle, superb action, and character moments.  It is what every popcorn film should strive to be.

Of course, some fans will complain over the emphasis on action over political intrigue and such.  I get it, I love that stuff in the show, but we just have to accept that we're dealing with two different mediums.  If you're going to make a blockbuster movie you have to appeal to the masses, and Abrams Star Trek movies do it incredibly well.

If you are one of those Star Trek purists who cannot accept the changes made in the 2009 reboot you're better off steering away from this entry as it will probably give you more to gripe about.  But if you're a casual Trek fan like me who loved the 2009 film you will not be disappointed.",1369180800,8,3401,4.656040268456376

5294928,5,B009934S5M,"Compelling. Intense. Emotional. Brilliant.

Let me just say that I am not the type of person to describe a movie as ""brilliant"" but that's all I could think walking out of this movie!

THE GOOD

-The plot was smart and entertaining. Not quite something we've never seen before, but it's still really well crafted. J.J. Abrams proves once again he is a great story teller when it comes to directing. Summary: James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is struggling with his responsibilities as captain. But When Starfleet is attacked by one of their own (Benedict Cumberbatch) Kirk must prove if he truly has what it takes to command The Enterprise, and if his crew can find the terrorist and bring him to justice. I know a lot of hard core Trekkies are thinking ""Oh, great, Star Trek has become a simple popcorn flick"". Don't worry, plenty of twists and turns (along with a few Easter Eggs and nods to the original series).

-Acting is absolutely perfect. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana and the rest of the Enterprise cast all give great performances as the iconic crew. Newcomer Benedict Cumberbatch steals every scene he is in, giving an impressive (and intimidating) performance as the film's villain, John Harrison. There are no bad performances in the movie.

-Effects are incredible. The action is exhilarating while enhanced by the 3D. The CGI is great, but the impressive set designs and practical effects should not be overlooked.

-Very fast pacing, not a dull moment here. despite the film's length, it goes by pretty fast. Very entertaining beginning to end.

THE BAD

-Pacing is great, but probably TOO fast. There should be at least a few more minutes in the middle to give audiences time to breathe! Probably one are two more action sequences than there needs to be (although they are all fantastic and well done).

-Too much lens flare. It works for a lot of the movie, but is seriously over used. It can be pretty distracting from what's going on at times.

Overall, there are very few problems with the movie (for me). There are certain twists that take the movie back to source material from the original series, which work really well. There are also certain events from other Star Trek movies that, in a way, repeat themselves in this story. I wouldn't call this a remake, cause this is a new series that takes place in an alternate timeline, due to the time travel that occurred in the first movie from 2009. Point is, some of theses ""events"" that repeat themselves some fans will love, others will hate. Again, there are certain parts of the film (for the hard core Trekkies) that will be hit or miss.

As a casual fan of the Star Trek franchise, I loved this movie. Not ALL of the throwbacks to classic Star Trek work, but I at least appreciated them. This isn't just an entertaining action movie, it's a good movie in general. It doesn't quite go where no Star Trek movie has gone before, but it's still one heck of a ride.",1369094400,13,2942,4.649325626204239
5294929,5,B009934S5M,"I just saw the movie on Sunday. Met all my expectations. As a practically life-long Star Trek fan, I enjoyed the weaving of the old Star Trek timeline with the new movie. It made the movie a lot fun to watch, and the special effects and action were quite simply awesome. Scotty and McCoy are great in their roles. The actors chosen to fill in the shoes of the old cast meet, and at times exceed, expectations. They really respect the roles as they were created, and yet are able to add their own twist on it.

However...

I agree to a point with the criticism of Abrams and where and how he is driving the franchise. There could have been more science, exploration and in the movie...after all, that is a major component of Star Trek too. While the characters were developed well, the driving mechanism of the movie - action above all else -took some of the wind out of the sails of the old personalities we has longtime fans have come to know, love and appreciate. While I love the chemistry b/w Kirk and Spock, there is something missing. Maybe I'm just being nostalgic. One thing that irks me - the love thing between Spock and Uhura. Bothers me to no end. It doesn't detract from the movie - it's just kind of annoying, like a forced love thing. That's Kirk's place for crying out loud!

If Abrams continues to do Star Trek movies, I hope he finds a way to weave some of the classic elements of the franchise. Exploration, exemplify the best of mankind, and clever twists on the use of science. The movie was excellent, and I enjoyed virtually every moment (Spock/Uhura love thing aside). However, weaving the action style with more science and exploration elements would be my only suggestion.",1369094400,12,1698,4.52442996742671

The man's a genius.

STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is terrific; it maintains the integrity of the characters, is true to the ideals of the franchise, and besides all that it is a GREAT MOVIE. I thought it hit on all cylinders, even some hokey ones...which any true fan knows are all part of the Star Trek persona. In fact, this new ""alternate universe"" Star Trek is really doing a great job of keeping up with the traditions of the old series, treating the parallels with both reverence and, at times, playfulness.

I applaud the decision to shoot it in IMAX; every shot in this movie is crisp and lush and BIG. STID is visually so immediate it feels like it takes place in your veins; even the sounds are intense. In our showing one nearby gentleman stood up during the credits and bellowed to the audience, ""Did anyone else think this was too loud?"" and NO ONE answered him. I certainly didn't...though yes, it was loud, it was so alive and urgent that I felt I was sharing their atmosphere.

So much is done to give the movie an amazing sense of presence, as if Abrams truly understands the reverence that even scientists love to ""Trek."" For instance, whenever warp drive is achieved the ship has that familiar e-long-a-tion that, a la Einstein's theory, stretches it just before it punches into warp. But now the vessel makes a final splintering SNAP! as it disappears, and there is a brilliantly iridescent blue trail that the camera immerses us in as it crackles and pops, as if even its speed is a living entity. And Abrams also understands there is nothing like being aboard the captain's command center; it has a luminous blue and white that shimmers in its intensity, making it what it should be: a magical place that pulses with the presence of command. Even the inclusion of the very appropriate but always missing ""Permission to come aboard the bridge!"" is a welcome addition, addressing not only proper naval etiquette, but also the privilege it is to enter the command center of a ship - and ESPECIALLY the Enterprise.

As for characterization, the new Trek advances the personalities of the crew without being faithful to the characters they inhabit. There is so much that is correct here in this new iteration of the storyline that I continually found myself actors morphing into the original characters. Chris Pine inhabits Captain Kirk perfectly; he has his swagger and seeming invincibility down so pat that his eventual moment of humility seems truly genuine and moving. The opinion of Sheldon (of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Into-Darkness-Blu-ray/dp/B009934S5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8""></a>) aside, Zachary Quinto's Spock and Karl Urban's Bones are so spot on that they seem to inhabit the skin of the original actors. To say too much in the way of specifics would be reveal spoilers, but I will tell you that attention is being given to the original series in so many ways. So many moments will cause Trekkers to grin; and, beyond the more obvious ones there are even some moments and actions that only REAL Trekkers would notice. For instance (and don't worry, I'm being cautious of spoilers): the very fact that Chekov is absent from the bridge for a while is significant, as is the name of a new character. (If there's no Trekker around you, look it up.)

And Benedict Cumberbatch is also magnificent as the villain John Harrison; truly intense and dark, he seems to inhabit his rogue with a sinister passion - his lip seems to curl with each word, and he loads the glare of his eye with an evil intensity as deep as space. He is more than a match for Kirk and  the Enterprise, and he carries off his role with such a style that there must be SOME way to get him to return in the future...I would look forward to that so much that I'd look for a wormhole to get there.

Abrams has taken a giant leap ahead with STID. He has created a universe LIKE the original, but with the ability to take the old stories and move on FROM there, with respect and admiration for the original. Above all, I suspect Roddenberry himself would have liked this new take on his franchise, because it envisions what he had hoped for: a universe built upon respect for individual rights, where - to quite liberally quote the famous mantra - to boldly go where no one has gone before...or if they did, to go there again, and do something unique the next time around, reverentially, carefully, and with great love.",1369094400,9,5661,5.6415981198589895

5294933,4,B009934S5M,"In Star Trek Into Darkness, his follow-up to 2009's blockbuster reimaginging of the Star Trek franchise, JJ Abrams delivers a visually spectacular and action-packed installment that's big on spectacle and a little forced on plot.

The plot in its simplest form pits the crew of the Enterprise against a mysterious and vicious figure known as John Harrison, a former member of Starfleet who commits an act of terrorism against London and flees to a war-zone planet outside the neutral zone. Captain Kirk and his crew embark on a manhunt to capture Harrison with the hopes of exacting revenge and preventing further bloodshed.

The film itself looks fantastic; Abrams is a true master of visuals and spectacle, both of which are on huge display here. The cityscapes, set pieces, and space effects, including travel and starships, are incredibly detailed and a wonder to behold.

The cast, as in the previous film, are equally enjoyable to watch; Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have really nailed their respective characters in Kirk and Spock and have a lot more camaraderie this time around. The rest of the fantastic crew has returned for this installment as well, including Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, and Bruce Greenwood. As for the newcomers, Peter Weller is well cast in his role as Admiral Marcus, the man responsible for sending Kirk to catch Harrison. Alice Eve is also very good as Carol Marcus, reassigned science officer of the Enterprise and daughter of Admiral Marcus. The biggest newcomer to the film is that of the villain, played by the increasingly intriguing and engaging Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays his part extremely well and, for me, is one of the highlights of the film.

Alas, if only the story could have been as strong as the visuals and cast. The plot, while entertaining as hell and lot of fun to watch, has quite a few holes that can simply be chalked up to sloppy writing. I'll keep this review spoiler-free but there were multiple instances I found myself scratching my head because of what was unfolding onscreen. While this didn't detract from the fun I had while watching the movie, I found myself thinking more and more about the problems with the script afterwards. Don't get me wrong; the film is an outstanding summer blockbuster that will hold its own in the Trek catalog, it just contains a few plot points that were either too convenient or too unexplained for my taste.

Overall this is a really good follow-up in the rebooted Star Trek universe and has everything an summer popcorn-flick should. Though it does have some plot issues, I highly recommend this if you're a fan of action blockbusters, sci-fi, or the 2009 reboot.",1369094400,5,2702,4.890829694323144
5294934,5,B009934S5M,"Fantastic follow-up to the 2009 reboot.

The story follows in the same vein as the previous installment, with Kirk continuing to be the reckless captain we know and love, while Spock provides the more serious foil to this. We get a nice build up, a perfectly executed villain (seriously, no idea who Benedict Cumberbatch was before this, now I want to see everything he has been in), a few nice twists that you don't see, a few obvious twists that are very nice nonetheless. The graphics are stunning, the acting is fantastic. I saw this and Iron Man 3 on the same day with someone, and we both agreed without question this was the stronger film.

Basically, if you liked the 2009 reboot, watch this, you'll love it. If you didn't like the 2009 reboot...see this anyway unless you absolutely hated it, because this was still much better (I liked 2009, but still, this is better).",1369094400,10,879,4.628205128205129

5294936,5,B009934S5M,"Four years have passed since JJ Abrams' last Star Trek film. And it was well worth the wait. Diehard Trek fans as well as new fans to the franchise will enjoy this fast-paced, action-packed adventure. Those familiar with the original series will, of course, catch more clues and references to the impending story and correlation to the alternate version. And this super-fan was not disappointed in the least. My one complaint is that Abrams could stand to tone down the lens flares during the bridge scenes.

Full of intense fight scenes, drama, suspense, intrigue, and plenty of humor, Star Trek Into Darkness is an excellent sequel. And while I loved the story, the strong point for the film is the characters.  We had the backstory and groundwork set in the previous film, and here we see the characters grow and their relationships develop. The cast and acting is spot-on, once again. Chris Pine (Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock), and Simon Pegg (Scotty) have great, central roles in this film. I wish Karl Urban (Bones) had more screen time. I think he's fantastic. And of course, Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant in his complex, villainous role.

While some of the big mystery reveals were a bit predictable, especially to fans, I think it served as a respectable homage.  I only hope we don't have to wait another four years to see another installment. But with Abrams focusing on Star Wars next, Star Trek will need to pass on to another director for that to happen. A strong foundation has been laid here with this alternate crew with limitless possibilities for new stories and adventures, whether it be more films, tv, or novels. I'll certainly be going to see this one a few more times in the theater, especially on IMAX. The 3D screening was nice, but after the first hour I forgot about it. Beyond the first few scenes, I don't think the 3D is necessary. Either way, don't miss this exciting sequel.

5294937,5,B009934S5M,"What a ride!

Taken by itself, this meets the highest standards of SF/action movies. The cast was great, even if Kahn sort of stole the stage from the Enterprisers. Effects and CGI can't be beaten, especially the various starships in distress. The plot moved well and kept the pace up right to the end.

As a part of the Star Trek canon, it works pretty well. The various actors representing the younger versions of McCoy, Uhura, Scotty, and the rest had close-enough physical resemblances to the originals to keep the continuity believable. I'm not a die-hard fan, so I have no complaint about how this script fits with the rest of the Star Trek universe.

That said, the highest standards of SF/action movies tend toward weak spots in a few areas. Would it have been that easy to forge official Star Fleet papers, not once but twice? Would Scotty's approach to that other ship have gone un-noticed? Would ... well, lots of things. Is it just me, or do recent movies demand more in the way of suspending disbelief?

No matter, it was an evening very well spent.

I have read alot of reviews, alot of complaints, but when I left the theatre I knew I had been entertained from beginning to end by Star Trek.  This new re-booted franchise has been Star Trek in an 'alternate time' since the beginning and Into Darkness works as it continues that concept.  It is funny, filled with action, and offers old Trekkies something that is 'known' but in a fresh, new and alternative way. The villian of this movie is an amazing and powerful actor.  The Enterprise Crew does a better acting job than in the first movie.  I cannot imagine another James T. Kirk than Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto is excellent as Spock.  This movie is neither unimaginative nor predictable.  It takes skill to re-tell a tale in a new and exciting way and Into Darkness does just that.

I went with my husband and my 26 year old daughter, who usually cannot stay awake in a movie and had never cared much for the old Star Trek Series.  She is going to see it again and taking her friends with her.  I plan to do the same.",1369094400,6,1061,4.36734693877551

I saw this movie in 3D and Imax I want to look at the movie with out the wrapping all the flashy stuff and exploding stuff and as many say the lens flair moments. This is a hard review for me to write I love Star Trek the TV shows and most of the movies but this second in the ""reboots"" just left me wondering.

First the Imax was great the 3D I can not comment on due to a vision problem that does not allow me to see 3D. Now on to a breakdown of the movie.

The movie opened with what I call the Raiders of the Lost Ark scene it was almost lifted right from raiders and at that time my worry set in was I going to see anything new or was what I call the George Lucas effect going to step in and sadly we got the Lucas effect.

The reboot the new time line was to give ST it's own legs the freedom to go where no other ST has gone before. And where do we find the story we are dropped right in to The Wrath of Kahhn Yes JJ did a great job hiding at least from me the fact that Kahhn was back. I stayed away from reading about the movie so I may have been one of few that was like oh he is Kahnn . So now we are going to rehash the story that we already know about. But wait there is more let's throw in a dash of ST Undiscovered country in to the mix and let's play a game of trading places with Spock and Kirk this time let's kill Kirk but at the same time let's give away how he is saved half way into the movie. This movie held nothing new nothing to boldly go where no man had gone before. We took the opening from one movie and the base story from to others. I really expected more a lot more from this second movie.

We have a completely new time line do you think we can get a completely new story???",1369094400,8,1901,3.80253164556962

I thought that after the first reboot movie and they continue to prove themselves to be the right cast - including of all people Bruce Greenwood as Pike. Love him in the role. Same goes for all of them. I found it comically ironic that Peter Weller was the bad guy - can he play anything else?  Of course I continue to be amazed at how pleased I am at the role of Zachary Quinto as Spock.  The movie visuals were amazing. Special effects awesome as expected... music-great... Story-great - Ah Kahn! You genetically engineered devil!

5294941,1,B009934S5M,"OMG and Abrams has the gall to call this Star Trek?  Star Trek had morals, humans were out of their infancy and were exploring the galaxy. ENTER JJ ABRAMS.
Last movie was good.  Even though they destroyed Vulcan.  As a fan I could see the crew and the Federation overcoming alot of hurdles to make a brighter future. Nope. Not in Abrams playbook. He brings in the worst kind of campy sci/fi, leeching off of Wrath of Khan, and effectively changing fundemental character traits in the cast. (You know 'new' timeline...) Spock is changed from a loyal commander who was willing to take chances (Anyone remember the Menagerie?) to a whining, disloyal crybaby. Kirk at least makes sense. Still the rebel, but without the discipline of the Academy. The new Scotty, is so freaking irritating, I'd give alot to boot him into the warp core. Mccoy is decent. And this romance between Spock and Uhura should never have been written in the first place.  Now it is getting to be really annoying. Abrams is changing basic character traits that shouldn't have been affected. He is manipulating Star Trek, with nods to TOS, to appease the fans,to get new interest. The Universe is not even recognizable as Star Trek except for the names. He is taking too many liberties just for the almighty dollar. If Roddenberry had still been alive, he would never have allowed this movie. And in my opinion, Abram needs to get back ontrack, or shove off.",1369094400,73,1426,4.714859437751004
5294942,5,B009934S5M,"I don't know what the critics were saying in their preliminary reviews.  I loved this film from start to finish and am looking forward to the next installment.  As the whole universe changed when Nero attacked Kirk's father's ship in the first film and that Vulcan was wiped out, one cannot expect that these movies should follow anything that the original series and movies did.  And because of the way Spock felt his race die, he will certainly have more ""human"" emotional outbursts at times.  It is only ""logical.""

When the movie starts, the Enterprise is on one of their first missions and two things go wrong.  Namely Spock needs rescuing and in doing so the Enterprise makes itself visible to a primitive group of people.  This violates the Prime Directive of non-interference in developing cultures (when was this ever a big deal in the original series?  All they did was interfere).  Kirk does not record anything in the ship's log but Spock does, because he can't lie.  (If you remember Taggart in the Beverly Hills Cop movie you will have an idea how this will play out later).

Kirk is briefly demoted and told to report back to Starfleet Academy for remedial training (I was wondering if he was going to meet up with Finnegan).  This lasts until a terrorist attack on London wipes out a bunch of senior Starfleet officers.  Kirk is told to get the terrorist (Harrison who goes by another name that us oldtimers know well) who has hidden himself in the Vulcan sector of space by Admiral Marcus.

The movie moves at breakneck speed as the Enterprise goes to bring back ""Harrison,"" despite the lovers spat that is going on between Spock and Uhura.  Mr. Scott seems to be on the ""out"" with Kirk and after an argument, quits the Enterprise and Mr. Chekov has to get Engineering up to speed.

The character that steals the movie is McCoy.  The new McCoy goes overboard with spewing cliches that would make DeForest Kelly proud to the point of getting on Kirk's nerves.  He is also worried about Kirk's health and will pick the ""wrong"" times to examine him.

Note possible spoiler - there is a brief mention of having to take care of Mudd's ship, so of course we will see a familiar furry friend make an appearence.

I really hope that Abrams will continue with a third installment of this film.  If this film is any indication, then the Star Wars franchise is in good hands!",1369094400,10,2381,4.608076009501188
5294943,5,B009934S5M,"J.J. Abrams (Lost, Super 8) hit this one out of the park because Star Trek (2009) was an amazingly good character driven and origin story film filled with good drama, some comedy and some action, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is literally a visual roller coaster of action and fun. The 3D is effective in this film and more importantly the action and suspense does not stop at all.  Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (both on Transformers and Fringe), along with Damon Lindelof (Prometheus, Lost) to the story to the next level and the stakes are much higher in this film - literally.

Watching this film was also an experience of audience participation with cheers, tears, fears, applause and even ""oooo's"" and ""ahhhhs"" and tons of laughter, laughter and hysterics throughout most of movie! What I really liked about the movie is that once again it took the original series concepts and turned them upside down and twisted them and made them fresh. Some familiar and yet not familiar moments do occur and you have to see it to understand what I mean.

What also received a warm applause at the end of the film from the entire audience was a proud dedication the filmmakers give to the ""...Post 9/11 Veterans..."", giving them thanks and praise for their past and present service at home and abroad.

Chris Pine (Rise of the Guardians, This Means War) does the comedy just as well as he does the drama and his passion for the role is clear with his wild James T. Kirk agenda, which often isn't exactly what Starfleet would approve. Zachary Quinto (Heroes, Margin Call) does an incredible Spock once again. His passionless persona is passion-ful and his commitment to subtlety conveying meaning without saying a word is amazing. The chemistry between Chris and Zach is blissfully apparent on screen and their compassion for each other as Starfleet officers is fully developed in this film

Karl Urban (Dred, Bourne Supremacy) is the cantankerous ""Bones"" McCoy and Karl is having an amazing time with this in this film. His charm is burning through his bitterness and sarcasm throughout the film. Zoe Saldana (Avatar, Columbiana) as Uhura really gets to shine in this film as her relationship with Spock is tested and it happens in some very funny scenes between their domestic arguments they have. (And they have them in front of Kirk!)

I waited till now to discuss the story and I don't want to give any spoilers away, but the plot centers around why the film was dedicated to who it was dedicated to in the first place. Benedict Cumberbatch (Warhorse, Sherlock) plays a villain that would rival most villains. Mean, sadistic, relentless and extremely intelligent - all the elements you do not want a madman to have, and he has got them in spades! He is a terrorist who affects Kirk in a very personal way that causes Kirk to make his entire mission to get Benedicts' character. (And I am avoiding his name for a reason!) It's a real terrorist story.

Did I mention that Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) playing Chief Engineer Scott is one of the funniest things you'll ever see on screen in this film? Even when he resigns? (Oooops, tiny spoiler - or maybe not, you'll see.) John Cho (American Beauty, Harold & Kumar) has an amazing moment of power when he gets an unexpected upgrade and John plays it to the hilt and even has a moment that impresses himself quite a bit! The one who has the least amount to do, yet some very funny moments and one truly heroic moment, is Anton Yelchin (Fright Night, Terminator Salvation) as Chekov. He literally fixes and saves and fixes and saves...you have to see it for yourself.

Another brilliant performance by the father-figure Bruce Greenwood (I,Robot, DejaVu) as Captain Pike, sole `cheerleader' for Captain Kirk and all his troublesome antics. Bruce and Chris also have amazing chemistry as the surrogate father and son relationship that they have developed. And joining the cast this time around is Alice Eve (Men In Balck III, The Raven) as Carol Marcus, a specialist in a field that defiantly helps in the hunt for Benedict's character, as well as unexpectedly helping Benedict as well.

Now ad an Admiral with a mission and a twist (or two or three) that will very much surprise you and you have you wondering at all times, is Peter Weller (Robocop, Buckaroo Bonzai) adding to the mix of extremely high energy and fast pace.

And there is a really big surprise too! Everyone is back and in full form and full force and this is definitely a candy film for the soul. Take the drama and passion of the first film, sprinkle in some suspense, plot twists, a double extra helping of humor and scene by scene action on top of action on top of action on top of action, and you have ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" A film that will literally have something  for everyone, of all ages, to enjoy and you will definitely `feel' much better leaving the theatre then when you came in!

5294945,5,B009934S5M,"J.J. Abrams, who very successfully rebooted the long-dormant STAR TREK franchise in 2009, stated that he wanted to make a TREK film that wasn't exclusively for TREK fans. He wanted to make a film that anyone could get on board with the new crew of the USS Enterprise and enjoy just as much as longtime fans of the show and the previous films. It worked extremely well as an extremely entertaining and rollicking piece of summer entertainment, and not only was pleasing to those longtime fans, but brought in new fans as well. Now, Abrams is doubling down on the existing fans of the Star Trek Universe and still looking to bring in new fans with STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS, which is such a breathtaking piece of stellar entertainment that it stands currently as the film to beat for this summer.

Admittedly, it's hard to review this film without spoiling a myriad of plot points, but I'll do my best to avoid that. The film opens with all of our crew members returning to the Enterprise: Chris Pine as James T. Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Karl Urban as ""Bones"" McCoy, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty are all back and they're trying to save a planet from its own destruction, but Kirk violates Starfleet's infamous Prime Directive in saving Spock. This gets Kirk busted down by Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood, also reprising) to his first officer and Spock reassigned to another ship. But a terrorist explosion in London at a Starfleet facility carried out by rogue Starfleet officer John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch, most famous for his work as the titular detective in BBC's SHERLOCK) forces the upper echelon of Starfleet captains into a military operation, overseen by Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller), to take down Harrison. A horrific attack brings Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew, including a new science officer, Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), into conflict with Harrison and his plans for his revenge on Starfleet, which quickly escalates beyond what they would have imagined, and not every crew member will be returning from this voyage.

Abrams, and writers Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Damon Lindelof (most of these are part of Abrams' crew, working on some of his television shows like LOST, FRINGE and ALIAS, as well as some of his other films like MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III and the previous TREK film) are not reinventing the wheel here with INTO DARKNESS, but they are making that wheel turn at a frenetic and not frantic speed. All of the action and set pieces are huge and are tremendously exciting (particularly a sequence where a badly-damaged Enterprise is plummeting towards Earth being probably the highlight, but it's hard to say which is the most exciting) and it's clear that the films of Abrams' youth of the late 70's and early 80's, particularly films by Steven Spielberg (to whom he made the brilliant love-letter to in 2011's SUPER 8), have heavily influenced this film in how it moves and how it feels. The film has a breakneck pace that few of the more recent tentpole releases have had, but when it does need to slow down, it makes all it can of those scenes. And here, not only do the action sequences dazzle from a technical standpoint, there is a reason for them to be taking place both from a story and especially from a character point of view. There aren't many plot contrivances here that just propel the action forward and don't serve a need of character or story elements, which was something I felt seriously hindered the other big summer release so far, the tepid IRON MAN 3. Another standout here is the brilliant score from returning composer Michael Giacchino, who has become Abrams' John Williams here, rising the highs and sombering the lows of the story with his work.

The returning cast once again do an excellent job filling their roles on the Enterprise, with each character getting a severely kick-ass moment in the narrative, but from an Enterprise perspective, as is usually the case, this film is very much about Kirk and Spock and their bromance, which is a mix of antagonism and deep caring. However, this film, if it's anyone's, it's Cumberbatch's performance that keeps you on your toes and keeps you transfixed. It's a performance of absolute superiority, not only in a character-related sense, but just the skill in which he envelops himself with his perfect diction, his physicality, and his sense that he's not the bad guy here, because no good villain thinks they're a villain. He does what he thinks is right, and what he knows to be superior to anyone else's goals. Just barely running second to Cumberbatch though is once again Quinto, who was the standout of the first film as well as Spock. He treads a careful line between his half-human/half-Vulcan sides, and this is the first time in this series of feature-length films where we see, at times, a much more emotional side of Spock, and it ultimately makes for a more compelling character as well as a much more fulfilling performance. Don't get me wrong; I love Leonard Nimoy as Spock, but I never felt that he could do more like I feel with Quinto. The only cast member that feels short-changed here is newcomer Eve (who sadly has been in some truly abysmal films such as SEX AND THE CITY 2 and THE RAVEN), because other than being someone who is obviously important in the series' mythology, she doesn't really have a lot to do.

It's hard to keep the secrets that constantly cloak the productions of J.J. Abrams when you're reviewing one of his works, but I find that if you just stick to the basics, you can avoid things that people want to go in fresh to. The only thing I will state here is that, like in the first film, there's a lot of fan service to some of the bigger films of the original crew's films, but even moreso in this film. Some have called this film a ""remake"", which it most decidedly is not despite there being similar situations and even a strange mirror-universe restaging of one of the more famous scenes in the series, and the reason it's not a remake is because of that whole mirror-universe alternate-timeline that Abrams so refreshingly set the stage for in the first film of the reboot. That gives the narrative of this series a very unpredictible sensibility. There were moments I didn't see coming at all, and what's more is that no one crew member ever seems safe to return for the next film. Abrams really risks running the ire of fans with this series and probably even moreso with this film, but so far, it seems to be paying off in spades.

If 2009's STAR TREK was that summer's IRON MAN, than Abrams' INTO DARKNESS is very much 2013's AVENGERS. It's a mighty film with an epic scope, great performances, great humor and a satisfaction that only the best of the summer blockbusters can give and will be very difficult to surpass on that level of sheer entertainment.",1369008000,8,6887,4.697847682119205

Longer Version: I was surprised how much I liked this new Trek movie. It had more elements that made Star Trek.. Star Trek. Such as, caring about the Prime Directive and at least talking about exploring the universe. There is still, for me at least, too much FLASH/BOOM in the movie, but that's what audiences want to see apparently so you are in for a treat. Lots to see, great sets, awesome visuals, the CGI is top notch. I won't go into the specific plot points, but I'm guessing the next movie will involve some angry Klingons! The designers also introduced a new look for the dress uniforms which involve a Bitch'n hat that Spock wears smartly in a few scenes. Look for them this Halloween ;-) Oh, one last note, there is no reason why the Star Trek and Star Wars universe couldn't cross paths just once.

***

I might be the only person on Earth who liked this movie more than I liked Abrams' Star Trek 2009. Unfortunately, that's partly because I disliked the 2009 Star Trek. But Into Darkness does have stunning visuals, some fun moments, and a much more compelling villain. It seems overall that viewers who don't know much about Star Trek seem to enjoy this movie and Abrams' larger take on Trek, whereas many viewers who do know Trek despise this movie. I'm more of the latter category (I've watched Trek since 1994), and while I don't *hate* Abrams' versions there are serious problems. Here are my thoughts.

SPOILER WARNING: I've included spoilers in my review. I found out about some key moments in the film before having seen it. I think in retrospect it was a good thing. There are some moments in the movie that can be maddening for Trek fans and having them spoiled actually allowed me to get my frustration out of my system before seeing the movie. I think I enjoyed the movie more having been spoiled. IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS, DON""T READ THIS REVIEW.

THE STORY

I love the beginning of this movie. Basically, Kirk violates the Prime Directive to save Spock. However, Spock reports him and Kirk gets demoted. The story connects to classic Trek and it gives the characters more emotional weight.

Unfortunately, the movie doesn't really continue with this intro. The rest of the movie follows rogue Starfleet officer John Harrison, who engages in several acts of terrorism against Starfleet. This part of the movie becomes a bit convoluted. Basically, the entire plot is an attempt by Starfleet Admiral Marcus to frighten Starfleet and to start a war with the Klingons, but what a convoluted way of going about it. When Harrison flees to the Klingon homeworld, Marcus sends the Enterprise to Kronos (yes, it's misspelt in the movie) to kill him. This part of the movie is fun, but a bit short on logic. Apparently, nobody thought to make diplomatic overtures to the Klingons to request that they return Harrison. Given that Harrison seems not to get along with the Klingons, it's hard to imagine they'd keep him.

I wish the movie had explored the consequences of Kirk's violating the Prime Directive and show Kirk actually struggle to get his command back. However, he's back in the captain's chair within a few minutes. This is fine. It gives the initial scenes a bit less emotional weight, but the second third of the movie is still fun. Where the movie really weakens though is the final third. It basically becomes a rehash of The Wrath of Khan. Things happen way too quickly, without any space to breath and let the emotional impact of events sink in.

There are a bunch of stupid plot twists that drove me nuts. Why on Earth was the Enterprise underwater in the beginning of the movie? I'm sure it was because Abrams thought it would look cool, but it makes no sense. Why would Admiral Marcus tell Kirk to fire torpedoes with Khans crew at Kronos? Why not just regular torpedoes? Sure, you could come up with contrived explanations, but like the 2009 movie this movie stretches logic.

THE VILLAIN

Given that I claim the final third of the movie borrows heavily from The Wrath of Khan, it's worth mentioning that John Harrison is Khan. Yes, despite all denials to the contrary, he is Khan. This is both good and bad. Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the few actors who can bring enough menace and charisma to the character to make a believable Khan. However, in this movie Khan's motives are pretty mundane. He just wants to get his 72 crew members back. Khan here has no ambitions to rule the galaxy, no epic quest for revenge. In fact, in one scene, Khan actually tears up when talking about his crew.

In short, while there was potential, Khan in this movie just never rises to the level of epic villain. The only reason anybody would care about Khan is because of the legacy of The Wrath of Khan. For much of the movie, Abrams could have substituted almost any other name for John Harrison without changing the villain's role. In fact, by making the villain Khan, I think it forced viewers who had seen Star Trek II to drew too many comparisons with Khan from that movie. It might have been better to just have had a fresh villain, perhaps a human or alien terrorist.

THE CHARACTERS

As with the 2009 Star Trek, I'm impressed with how well the new batch of actors mimic their counterparts from the Original Series. That said, Into Darkness is even less about the ensemble and more about the Kirk and Spock bromance. There are two problems here. First, one of the key relationship dynamics in the Original Series was the three-way dialogue between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Spock represented logic, McCoy represented emotion, and Kirk was the balance. However, in the Abrams movies McCoy has been relegated to a background character and to compensate has taken Kirk to an emotional extreme. I think there's a real opportunity missed for a band of brothers relationship between the three men.

Second, Spock is just too emotional. I don't mean that Vulcans never have emotions. However, in the Abrams movies, especially Into Darkness, Spock's default is emotional. This becomes particularly bad near the end, when Spock becomes enraged, yells ""KHAAAAAN!"", and goes off to chase Khan. The problem is that we never see Zachary Quinto's Spock as the cool, collected, logical Vulcan we see from the TV series and original movies. It's fine to show Spock's emotional side sometimes, but making him too emotional minimizes those moments.

CINEMATOGRAPHY

This is really where the movie shines. Abrams really knows how to paint a pretty picture. The intro sequence with the red planet and the white aliens with yellow robes was wonderful. The battle scenes are intense and when the Enterprise takes damage it really appears pretty damaged. Despite my other complaints, I do wish other Star Trek movies looked this good.

That said, the movie just doesn't slow down. There's no room for viewers to breath and absorb the emotional impact of events. Nicholas Meyer, director of Star Trek II & VI, says it's important to make some scenes special and some scenes mundane. However, in Abrams' movies, all of the scenes are so bold and busy that viewers really don't get a sense of which, if any scenes, are special (perhaps except radiation chamber scene). It's like a roller coaster ride with lots of ups and downs but to straightaways.

THE ENDING

As I said above the final third of the movie was the biggest disappointment. There's a situation where Spock grieves for Kirk. It's pretty much a direct rip on Wrath of Khan. I'm fine with a subtle homage. But what really frustrated me was that the end sequence is just a big fistfight between Khan and Spock. The scene lacks any tension and moreover takes place on a moving transport shuttle on Earth in broad daylight. While I think Abrams usually gets the visuals right, here the visuals were not only silly but also didn't provide a climax for the final battle. There was no battle of wits, just a pedestrian brawl.

One reviewer (I think the Transporter Room 3 podcast) said it best: at this point, the characters haven't earned this ending. We've only had one movie before this one with Kirk and Spock. It's not clear how that emotional became so deep. It just doesn't work when viewers know that Kirk will be resurrected. I think the ending could have been just as effective if Uhura had died, and made more sense.

THE VERDICT

Overall I give Into Darkness 3.5 stars. It's better than the 2009 Star Trek in my opinion, but Abrams still doesn't seem to understand Star Trek. This is all popcorn movie with little intellectual or emotional heft. More importantly, Abrams seems a bit too willing to make large leaps in logic and to fall back on action sequences rather than develop the plot. I'd still recommend seeing it. Despite my complaints, I did enjoy the movie and I'll buy the blu-ray. It just lacks the thoughtfulness of Star Treks II and VI, and that's a shame. If Abrams does make another sequel, I'd recommend he watch Star Trek II and VI, but not just to copy the plot twists, but also the thoughtfulness in those films.",1369008000,134,8559,4.730201342281879
5294949,5,B009934S5M,"I have been a Star Trek fan since the original series ever since my Dad introduced me to the Star Trek universe as a child. We then would watch the other series together when they were new... TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise + the movies. Thankfully years later we have continued the tradition and saw Into Darkness and all I can say is I felt like I was a little child again talking about it constantly after the movie. My Girlfriend also came along (not a fan) and now is interested in watching some of the other movies (Wrath of Khan) + the shows to get a better understanding of the Star Trek world.

Some have come & gone, some still remain, and Star Trek is one who has a legion of fans still enthralled, wanting more.
The series went through many changes even winding up on those retro Saturday mornings when it wasn't retro, either live or animated. Then it had the original crew form a movie series which actually continued the legacy into high gear, thus furthered by ""the next generation"".
But the series doesn't feel truely at home without the chemistry between the original crew headed by James T. Kirk, and that my friend, is where the action is, and this reboot makes no bones about it, this is what Star Trek is all about.",1369008000,4,1020,4.459893048128342
5294952,2,B009934S5M,"A long time Star Trek fan, I naturally headed for the film the moment it was released in my area.  I saw the 3D version.  The film is action-filled, laden with special effects, and incorporates legendary ST baggage: the by-now parodistic banter between Kirk and Spock, and Kirk and McCoy, and Spock and McCoy, etc.  Karl Urban as McCoy, particularly, seems to be phoning it in, but perhaps it is not his fault: perhaps no grown man in the galaxy, can, at this point in time, sincerely wrap his mouth around another, ""Good God, man . .. !"" or ""Are you out of your corn-fed mind!?""  There are gaping holes (presumably, e.g., if the Enterprise would be incinerated by entering Earth's atmosphere at those speeds, so would the other ship).  The ""underwear"" scene with Alice Eve is, you should pardon the expression, nakedly gratuitous, and the writing for her and a petulantly drawn Lt. Uhura really awful, not to mention that the women are allowed to look like magazine covers, with lots of close-ups that show how much eye-makeup they wear, even in deep space, and that doesn't ever seem to be disturbed by catastrophic events, or tears, or the prospect of imminent death, ditto their gleaming hair, which remains bouncy and sleek through all.  The writing is simplistic, and Kirk reminds one of nothing so much as a high school jock - in fact, most of the acting is at the high school jock level,  except . . .

for Benedict Cumberbatch, whose presence reminds one that there was, after all, an adult actor on the set.  Cumberbatch easily walks off with the film, but he can take only partial credit for that: he was given little competition, unless you want to count the suspiciously enhanced-looking blue of Chris Pine's eyes.

Sometimes I wonder what would happen to ST if writers got their hands on it who were willing to let some of the older baggage go and offer us the kind of great writing and character development that, e.g., ""Aliens"" offered in addition to the special effects thrills.

Without Cumberbatch, this is just a run of the mill Star Trek exercise - if you love ST, you'll probably forgive most of its flaws.  If you admire Cumberbatch, it's worth the price of admission to watch as his skill, unconventionally attractive looks, and luscious baritone tear holes in ST cliches.  If you like both ST and Cumberbatch, well, what the hell, you'll probably end up seeing it twice.

If you don't care much for either the Star Trek franchise or Cumberbatch, save your money and go out to dinner instead.",1369008000,16,2516,4.675736961451247
5294953,4,B009934S5M,"I don't care, by now everyone knows that the bad guy is none other than Khan Noonien Singh, and knowing that ""spoiler"" (which it's not) would help to sell the movie to an older generation of Trekkies (worked for my dad).  And Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job playing the evil superhuman character, although I must complain that he was British and not from India (how did a white guy get a name like Khan?).  JJ Abrams brings his usual lens-flare camera-action style into the film, but he also quickens the pace of everything.  You get 15 minutes of non-stop awesome action, then 5 hilarious Trek jokes, then 15 minutes action, 5 more jokes (repeat until end of movie).  This sci-fi blockbuster moves along quickly and did not feel like it was over 2 hours.  It never gave me time to go to the bathroom, but I didn't need to because I never had time to drink any of my overpriced beverage.  I wonder how much of the movie was cut due to time?  (note to self: get special edition on blu-ray when released).  I did have a great experience, and I highly recommend seeing it in the theater.  Awesome sound, special effects, and Star Trek technobabble make it worth paying $20 bucks.  Now the cons (besides Khan): There are a few plot holes that Trekkie purists will tear apart, but to give more spoilers now would really divulge the whole plot.  And be sure to note that I have to remove almost a whole star due to those technicalities.  So I rate it 4.2/5 stars.  It's a good Trek movie, moves faster than its predecessor, and has more action (not to mention it's an ""even"" movie). There are also plenty of great surprises.

5294956,5,B009934S5M,"What's the deal with meaningless titles? They annoy me. The title has no more to do with the movie than it could have to many movies. Like The Empire Strikes Back could have been called Into Darkness, and it would have held more meaning to the actual movie than this one. I get that it sounds cool, but, seriously, the title (of anything) ought to relate to the thing that's being titled in more than some vague way.

Past that, though, the movie was pretty awesome. Abrams  knows how to bring the action and keep you tense and on the edge of your seat. And, hey, there was no red matter, this time, so double plus good. Without giving anything away, I loved best the role reversal of Spock and Kirk. That was pretty awesome.

I have only two negatives (other than the title) at this point:
1. I do not want to see ""old Spock"" pop up in every movie as their tiny ""god in a box."" I get that the fans love seeing Nimoy (I do; I get it), but, from a story perspective, it's gonna get old if they always contact him when they're in trouble.
2. As much as I love Simon Pegg and love Simon Pegg as Scotty, he is the one character that doesn't quite feel right. he has moments where he feels like Scotty but, most of the time, the character seems off target. I don't blame this on Pegg, as he has no control over the writers having him do things that are not ""Scottyish.""

Speaking of the characters, I still love Karl Urban the most. Man, he could be DeForest Kelley. I swear, I can't tell the difference; he's just like watching the original Bones at work. And they gave him the line! Well, not the line but a the line: ""I'm a doctor not a..."" It was awesome.

Zachary Quinto comes in a close second to Urban on pulling off the channeling of the original character. Of course, he has had the privilege of actually working with Nimoy, so he wouldn't have an excuse to not be able to pull it off.

And, well, then there's Benedict Cumberbatch who was a perfect match to the rest of the cast. Mostly, it's the voice. But he seems to be able to play any kind of role he wants to play (see War Horse and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to understand what I mean by that).

And that's really about all I can say about the movie without giving stuff away, and I don't want to do that. As someone who is not really a Star Trek fan, I loved the movie. I do know that there are Trek fans out there that don't like what Abrams is doing, but, really, I'm not quite sure I get that, because he's really captured the heart of the original series with how closely they've managed to get the characters to their originals. It's actually enough that it makes me want to go back and watch those old episodes, and how much more successful can you be than that?

I've also seen all of the movies...in theaters and at home on Blu ray.  But I'm no expert on this series or any other.

What I've always liked about Star Trek is the humanity, humor and honor Gene Roddenberry instilled in the franchise.  Director extraordinaire J. J. Abrams has managed to maintain that character in this his second time at the helm.  He also brings to the table a credible cast that manages to retrieve the original characters personalities while adding their own individuality.

In an action filled opening sequence, the Enterprise crew is on an exploratory mission when they decide to intervene in the evolution of a remote planet, and its primitive inhabitants, on the verge of destruction from a large volcano.  This is in violation of The Federation's code and James Kirk (Chris Pine) is relieved of his command as a result.

The appearance of a terrorist named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch in a chewy role) returns Kirk and crew to chase him to forbidden Klingon territory.  Zachary Quinto returns as Spock in yet another good performance of the Vulcan science officer and second in command.  ""Into Darkness"" borrows some important plot points from past episodes that I won't give away here.  What is important is that this may exceed even the Star Trek reboot from 2009 in terms of action and suspense.  We know all the characters now, so we can concentrate on villains, collisions, space battles and fist fights.  And Abrams is a master.

I saw this theatrical production on a large IMAX print in 3D and it equals ""Avatar"" in terms of production quality.  I never noticed any departure from the large print but here is some information I found on Kodak's website regarding the film:

""(Dan) Mindel upped the ante further by shooting about 40% of Star Trek Into Darkness in the huge 15-perf IMAX format, which captures a negative image nearly 10 times the area of a standard 35mm frame. Almost the entire story that unfolds outside the Enterprise spaceship was shot with IMAX cameras, usually mounted on Technocranes to facilitate movement. Some scenes were also shot 65mm 8-perf. In using the IMAX format on a narrative feature, Mindel and Abrams were following a trail blazed by Christopher Nolan and Wally Pfister, ASC, BSC on The Dark Knight. In fact, Mindel and Abrams consulted with Nolan and Pfister, who encouraged them to go for it.""

5294960,5,B009934S5M,"Satirical, Emotional and Epic are the only words to describe the new movie Star Trek Into Darkness. I got a chance to visit the Paramount lot for an exclusive screening of this movie, which left me in awe and thrill. Although this movie is a sequel  to the previous Star Trek series, movie goers who are not familiar with the story will understand the plot clearly. The actors portray their characters very well thanks to the director, J.J Abrams. The scenery and set for the futuristic year of 2240 are so vivid and realistic, audience members will forget they are in the year 2013. This movie is also produced for the IMAX 3D, which puts all the explosions and fight scenes in your face.

The relationship of all the characters on the iconic Starship Enterprise are deep and meaningful. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachery Quinto) develop a brotherly love through the struggles they conquer. The Villain, Khan (Benedict Cumberpatch) is a scary two-faced character that will leave the audience guessing his fate until the very end. Not only does the main star achieve his role prefectly, but the co-stars also do an superb job. The writers, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof successfully add comedy in the script to bring an emotional roller coaster to the audience.

The set ranges from modern skyscrapers to futuristic spaceships. The designers portrayed the theme very well, using many computer generated images to create the year of 2240 in a way that makes it seem so real. The 3D element is an added bonus because it brings the action up close. The beginning scene has lots of running and fighting sequences and yet it is all filmed in such detail that the characters seem like they are going to run off screen.

After watching this movie, my passion for Star Trek has been sparked! I rate this movie 5 out of 5 because it balances the comedy and action scenes so well. It has multiple themes taking place but the on-going theme ""the power of friendship can build you or destroy  you"" is present throughout. This movie contains a hand-full of violence but is not bloody or graphic. The action sequences, violence and realistic make-up could be scary for younger audience members so, I recommend this for ages 13 to18. This movie has sparked an interest in Star Trek for me and hopefully, it will do the same to you.

I enjoyed it even more the second time, as I got over my worries about wether or not it would measure up to the 2009 reboot (ultimately it does) and just enjoyed it as a fun ride. The film has some nice twists and turns, nods to the original series and some expansion on themes touched upon in the first movie. If you only saw it once, the DVD would be a great way to sit back and enjoy it again.",1369008000,4,574,3.8728813559322033
5294963,4,B009934S5M,"Ok folks; here's my spoiler-free review of Star Trek: Into Darkness:

First off I'll say that this was, hands down, a fun, fun film to see.  J.J. Abrams certainly knows how to carry an audience and cast a film - which is more than a minor achievement given that he's playing with something that is considered nearly sacred... as in sacred in the religious sense by untold millions of people.  For a veritable unknown in the Trek world AND an admitted non-fan of the franchise (He's since reversed that position, by the way), J.J. has proved himself adept at understanding and respecting his audience - even if he stretches the credulity of the `old timers' almost to a breaking point in some cases to make his mark on the now 50 year old brain child of a world war II pilot who had a dream and a pen.

I want to get the negatives out of the way first so I can, in true Star Trek fashion, end this on a positive note.  And I should mention here that any perceived negative is so expertly blended with J.J.'s brisk paced yet conscientiously balanced style of story-telling that you almost forget you had an objection in the first place.  Damn you, J.J.! You actually made me feel good while giving me some pretty big objections to quibble over!  It's a love-hate thing for me.  Anyone who's as vested as me in Star Trek as a vehicle for intelligent story-telling will understand what I mean when they see the film for themselves.

My first objection is the use of very visibly superfluous plot contrivances solely for the sake of putting characters (and in my view of Trek, the Enterprise is as much a character as the flesh and blood cast) in places where they get to do something that looks ""Really, really cool"".  Abrams seems to put the cart before the horse in the sense that he has a visual idea of what he would like to see and THEN finds a way to integrate that into the story.  A couple of examples:

We are treated to a visually breathtaking opening sequence that puts the Starship Enterprise at the bottom of an alien world ocean and then lifted out in dramatic fashion for an atmospheric flight into the heavens...  Just think about what the Enterprise is in terms of design elements for a moment and let that sink in.  We're talking about suspending 190,000 tons of various metal alloys in a body of water, holding it at station keeping, lifting it out of the water, and maneuvering it through the atmosphere.  The whole purpose of Star Trek's starship design elements was to eliminate the need for atmospheric landings or maneuverings.  There are very practical reasons that shuttle crafts and transporters are included in the ship's complement of resources.  Not to mention the fact that it would be much less of a resource-heavy operation to simply place the Enterprise in high orbit and conduct ground operations using shuttle craft and transporters in the first place.

Next, we have a scene where Spock (Zachary Quinto) is standing inside an active volcano with a device that can render the volcano inert.  Again, it is visually a sight to behold - breathtaking really.  But it's completely unnecessary.  We're supposedly living in a time where we can convert matter to a data energy stream and place it, within a few millimeters of margin of error, exactly where we want it and then reconvert it to matter.  Even if we can't use this amazing technology, you're telling me that a species that designed something as incredible as this could find no other means of lowering a device to the right spot in the volcano and remote detonating it?  And it's obvious enough that you are (or will if you haven't seen it yet) having these thoughts while it's happening and you're STILL gonna think it's cool as hell!  You see what I mean by love-hate relationships?  Again, damn you J.J.!!!

My next objection is to the patently egregious use of glad-handed throw backs to the original television series and movies for the old-time fans.  During the film's third act there is a climactic scene where these throw backs are coming at you at such a rapid rate of delivery that it actually detracts from the story that they're trying to tell - which would be a fine story in its own right; a great vehicle for some fantastic character development - especially as it concerns Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Quinto).  I understand why these elements were included in the first film of the reboot franchise.  It was done deftly and was balanced in such a way that made you clap and cheer and feel good in all those fuzzy ways because you knew Abrams was really genuinely trying to respect the core fan audience even as he cracked Star Trek wide open for mass appeal.  It worked at the time and it worked very, very well.

But enough is enough.  We get it, J.J.  Really.  We don't need it in this second installment.  Star Trek (2009) was a fantastic setup.  You can take things anywhere you want now and we'll all be ok with it... I promise!  In Star Trek: Into Darkness, throwbacks are formulaic and paced to the point of absurdity.

Ok, those are my two big objections.  The rest I can just rattle off without getting into too much detail.  Admiral Marcus's (Peter Weller) motives are not made entirely clear in this film.  It's obvious that his character is allegorical to G.W. Bush and, it was a pretty well done allegory at that.  But still, I had a difficult time understanding the ""why's"" for his ""who's, what's, where's, and when's"".  He is a little one-dimensional and, hence, not as believable as a character.

Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) was nearly irrelevant.  She could have been replaced with some technicians already assigned to the Enterprise and the impact and emotional effect would have been the same.  There was a lot more that could have been done with her character but she's relegated to little more than an eye candy prop piece to set up another thread of continuity for future franchise installments.

 John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) as a character is written a bit thin.  We don't get quite enough to invest ourselves on the level of... say... Heath Ledger's ""Joker"" in `The Dark Knight'.  For me, that will stand as the benchmark for film villains for... forever.  But Cumberbatch more than makes up for that (I'll deal with that in the positives in a moment).

And finally, while there are numerous egregious violations of various laws of physics, as well as a few lazy dismissals of cause-and-effect relationships, and action/reaction interchanges, they are woven into a genuinely beautiful piece of filmmaking in such a way that I can safely not worry about them.

OK!  Now for the good stuff!

First: This film works, and works well primarily because of its cast.  Brilliant.  Hands down brilliant casting.  Thank you J.J. and company for taking the time to research and invest in the meaning and quality of these characters enough to make us love them... not just accept them as replacements.  Of particular mention is Zachary Quinto.  What he has done - is doing - with Spock's character is nothing short of beautifully poignant.  There is a depth and complexity there that is truly wonderful to behold -while being completely faithful to the storied history of this icon of science fiction lore.

But Quinto is not alone in deserving praise.  Pine's Kirk is stretched and molded - many times against his protestations - in this film and itis a refreshing departure from Shatner's faux Shakespearian ham-fistedness (as much as I admire Shatner's Kirk) and givse this Kirk a much more nuanced approach.  He is the `coming of age' allegory of this film and its predecessor and by the end of the film he leaves you filled with a sense of forward-looking optimism for his potential for growth and maturity.  Though Pine does not deliver any particularly breathtaking or scene steeling moments, his even handed approach to introspection and impulsiveness both waging an internal conflict in the character is a tribute to thoughtful and meaningful character development.

And while there are thoughts to share about each character, I'll focus the rest of my casting observations on the film's antagonist, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch).  I'll start by saying that he was not given a whole lot to work with.  The back story of his character seems rushed and not quite fleshed out.  But what Cumberbatch does with what he's given is nothing short of mesmerizing.  This man is an emotive and oratory juggernaut.  This is the man you want narrating your worst nightmare... or your funeral eulogy.  Cumberbatch's character is a swirl of relativistic ambiguity, internal turmoil, viscerally haunting anguish, and frightening ferocity... all delivered with a voice that commands that you listen.  You simply cannot dismiss this man, no matter how hard you try.  His character does have ties to former incarnations of Trek and while I have objections to Abrams choice to visit those particular threads of old guard continuity, Cumberbatch's performance stands entirely on its own merit and is deserving of nothing but praise.

Second, this film is visually breathtaking while not overreaching.  I'll use Transformers as a point of comparison in that while ILM did some of their most technically complex and out of the box breakthrough work on those films,  for all of its reaching, the Transformers films were, in the words of the late Roger Ebert, ""ugly films"".  They were an assault on the senses actually.  After nearly three hours of nonstop CGI pummeling, the medium itself becomes completely meaningless as a story-telling device and your left with a painful, hollow film that literally leaves you sighing in relief when the end credits roll.  But while Star Trek is, by default, an effects heavy film, it manages to maintain its soul and substance over its style.  The set pieces and VFX shots are dazzling.  They are used very effectively as mediums to communicate the optimism for humanity that is at the core of the message of Star Trek.  It is, quite simply, a visual feast and your home theater system will thank you in advance for ordering a Bluray copy and pushing that system to the limit!

And finally, as I mentioned briefly in the opening of this review, the pacing of this film is nearly perfect.  I say nearly because I personally feel that this film (as well as many others) could benefit from a few more reflective moments that are not moving franticly from set to set.  But that is only a minor quibble that I feel does not detract from the sheer sense of enjoyment that you will experience when watching this film.  And again, the cast is to be credited with carrying this near pitch perfect pacing with the delivery of some of the best conversational interplay ever offered in any film or television version of Trek.  It's evident that these people have chemistry working together.  You believe these characters.  They `feel' genuine.  There were some truly delightful moments throughout the film that made me laugh, made me think, and made me feel.  J.J. Abrams has proven himself adept at balancing emotional `hues' and `tones' in his execution of this film.  I felt that I was `carried' through this film with equal parts mischievousness, thoughtfulness, brevity, and bombast.  While giving a respectful nod to Trek's penchant for pedantic stump-speaking, Abrams has made Trek thoroughly enjoyable to watch.  He has been able to carry many of the critical core elements of what makes Star Trek `Star Trek' over to this new vision of Trek and craft a resurrected franchise with international appeal.

In the end, if you're lining this film up with the other 11 films and judging whether or not you should see it, it's a no brainer.  Star Trek: Into Darkness is a worthy entry into the franchise cannon and a thoroughly enjoyable movie.

5294966,5,B009934S5M,"I am a fan of the original movies and series.  I like TNG, but I love the reboot that Abrams started in 2009.  The new actors are completely believable as the original Enterprise crew and I love that we get to see them when they're younger.

This movie has everything you want in Star Trek:

-Humor: some great comedy moments between Spock, Kirk, and McCoy. And the actors keep all of the mannerisms we associate with these characters made famous by the original actors.

-A little romance: yes, Uhura and Spock are still dating.

-Lots and lots of action, but not mindless action.  Every scene in this movie has a purpose

-A nice twist at the end, but I think it added to the character development. (and no I won't spoil it.)

-You really get to see the relationship between Kirk and Spock grow.

Another thing I love about this movie is we see Kirk develop into the captain we are familiar with, and was made famous by William Shatner.  Kirk is still new to the captain's chair and is a bit reckless, which gets him into trouble with Starfleet.  However, when sent on a secret mission he soon finds that he has been pulled into a web of lies and deceit.  In order to save his crew and a bunch of innocent people, Kirk soon learns what it truly means to be captain of a ship--something Pike had been trying to teach him--and he discovers how much he is willing to sacrifice to save his crew.

So, don't believe the negative reviews.  This is a great movie and has everything you want in a Star Trek film.  It moves right along--not a single boring moment. And it ties a lot of holes that were left by the original series and movies--as in you see the character develop into the ones we love, but it also brings us right up to their five year mission, which is where the series began anyway.

Go to it. You'll be glad you did.",1369008000,6,1827,4.326470588235294
5294967,4,B009934S5M,"""Star Trek"" has come a long way since first airing on the NBC network in 1966. No other franchise has such a following of fans that span so many years. Those same fans like their ""Star Trek"" star-trekkie and don't like deviation. So when J.J. Abrams took over the movie franchise almost exactly 4-years ago, there was excitement and hesitation. Abrams not only revitalized the series that had presumably died, but he went back to the beginning to characters originally fleshed out by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, James Doohan, George Takei and Walter Koenig. He started over. On top of that, due to events in the 2009 movie, he wiped everything that ever happened with these characters in any episode or movie clean; as if it never happened.

""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is a combination of new ideas and classic stories. Abrams is making a point of doing new things and going new places, but at the same time being nostalgic with those trekkies that like their ""Star Trek"" more than their first born. The actors, especially Chris Pine (Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock), are all perfectly cast. Pine delivers that classic Captain Kirk charm, charisma, wit and cockiness. Quinto is so good at Spock even the trekkies don't complain.

""Into Darkness"" is less about establishing a connection with fans than having some fun. Not to say that Abrams didn't make a considered effort to connect with longtime fans, but after his first movie managed to slip by with wide spread approval, he has taken the gloves off and let the action fly. From the opening moments of the film until the closing credits, the movie is constantly interesting, action-packed and intelligent. A summer blockbuster has to do that, right? Yet, Abrams also delivers with emotional impact and a theme that resonates throughout the film about leadership and friendship.

There is a popular assessment of the history of ""Star Trek"" films that only the even numbered releases were worth watching. Abrams in my opinion has finally broken that trend because both of his movies deliver. The future of the ""Star Trek"" film franchise may once again be a tough one to read though. With Abrams also taking on the future ""Star Wars"" films, it makes you wonder if ""Star Trek"" will suffer. For now though, we have ""Into Darkness"" and it is exactly what you pay money for at the movies; a film that delivers on all levels of excitement and emotion.

Bottom line though, the original cast of this amazing series should be extremely proud. Not only did they lay the groundwork for a series that has spanned almost 50 years but the actors in the current movies are playing them; recreating them. That doesn't always happen when movies are remade. Yet, these current actors are paying homage to a cast of actors who couldn't have possibly known what they were starting in 1966.",1369008000,2,2862,4.846625766871166

5294969,1,B009934S5M,"After relaunching the Enterprise at full-warp speed back in 2009 with 'STAR TREK,'  JJ Abrams tragically manages to crash and burn with STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS.  A disjointed and unintentionally comical sequel on virtually all levels, INTO DARKNESS starts with Kirk and Bones leaping off a cliff, and just keeps on plummeting.  After ending 2009's 'TREK' with the new Enterprise crew ready to undertake its 5 Year mission into vast uncharted galaxies, INTO DARKNESS puts it all to to a dead stop.  Opening with Kirk botching one absurdly staged mission, he promptly looses the captain's chair of the Enterprise and is demoted.  Against this is set the emergence of villain John Harrison, a rogue Starfleet Agent (The 'huge spoiler' that everyone and their dead grandmother knows about by now).  Harrison is played with often absurd and even unintentionally hilarious intensity by Benedict Cumberbatch.

Cumbertatch's performance may boarder on camp at times, but his acts of terrorism against the Earth are anything but.  Visual Effects work by houses such as ILM and Pixomondo are shockingly somber when Harrison carries out the bombing of a high security Starfleet Archive in England, attacks Starfleed Headquarters in San Francisco, and in the film's climax, rams a massive Starship into the city itself.  This intermix of disturbing realism within a Star Trek film rife with accidental humor, 'trek' logic absurdity, juvenile love spat dialogue, an over-the-top Kirk/Spock tear-jerker fest, and other misfires could be construed to have led to the film's Post 9/11 Veterans dedication as an 'apology.'  Nothing could be further from the truth.  JJ Abrams is a passionate supporter of The Mission Continues, a nonprofit group that serves as a framework for US Military Veterans to do community service work when they return home from serving our Country.

If only Abrams had been more passionate about Star Trek this time around.  As the plot unravels, so does the film.  Savvy moviegoers see every plot development coming minutes before the shocked Enterprise crew does.  Of particular regret is the sacrifice Abrams makes in screen time with virtually every character except Kirk and Spock.  Abrams give each classic character his or her unique introduction in his original 2009 TREK, and gave them all unique purposes in the film's narrative and interactions with each other.  Not this time around.  Expect Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov only to pop up only when they're needed for comic, medical, engineering, annoying romantic, navigational, or Klingon translation relief.  We're talking scenes such as one in which Kirk whips out his Communicator aboard the Enterprise - which is stuck inside the Nuetral Zone, in Klingon space -  and talks to Scotty, who is back on Earth, sitting in a San Francisco bar, drowning his sorrows in booze.

By now the Tribble's out of the bag on just who Benedict Cumberbatch's character really is, and what the second half of the plot is really about - or more accurately, what it's really 'remaking.'  How does it all end?  With a Tribble, a chase, and Kirk waking up in bed happy to see Gandalf, Sam, Legolas, Pippin, Merry...............oops, I mean Spock, Bones, Uhura, Scotty, Sulu and Chekov, surrounding his bed, happy he's alive.  You have to see it to believe it.  At least Abrams stole only 1 of ""Return of the King's"" 23 endings.",1369008000,36,3389,5.096014492753623
5294970,5,B009934S5M,"I must start this review by prefacing that there are a myriad of actors and actresses in this movie that will appeal to various men and women due to the broad range of acting styles in ""Star Trek Into Darkness.""  My husband and I both wanted to see this movie due to our previous experience of liking the 2009 Star Trek film (it was one of the first movies we caught during the summer 2009 season). With that said, my husband's favorite character portrayal was the skillful acting of Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn. I can understand this because of the Kahn character being depicted as maniacally sinister but intellectually brilliant in challenging Spock and Kirk. As for me, my favorite character portrayals are a tie between Chris Pine's Captain Kirk portrayal, Zachary Quinto's Spock depiction, and Zoe Saldana's acting incarnation as Uhura. I enjoyed how the characters of Kirk, Uhura, and Spock brilliantly managed to keep their personal and professional lives separate for the greater good of saving the Enterprise.  There is even more action in this film and the carefully calculated emergence of new characters such as Dr. Carol Marcus, a  Science Officer (played proficiently by Alice Eve). The following actors also make significant contributions to the film's plot: Karl Urban, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, Bruce Greenwood, Peter Weller, Noel Clarke, Nazneen Contractor, and Joseph Gatt. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is good to watch for those who have previously enjoyed the 2009 Star Trek film and/or like science fiction movies.",1368921600,3,1546,5.102766798418973
5294971,5,B009934S5M,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a spectacular addition to the franchise. It's one of the very best Star Trek films, and is even better than the reboot that preceded it. SPOILERS FOLLOW

What makes it so good? In the first place, it's action-packed with great special effects, which is kind of key for a summer blockbuster, but that alone won't cut it with Star Trek fans. It also has good writing and surprisingly good acting. A lot of the plot is character driven, as Chris Pine's Kirk and Zachary Quinto's Spock continue to take each other's measure: by now Kirk and Spock are friends, but rather uneasily so. The impulsive, by the seat of his pants Kirk finds his relationship to Spock tested by Spock's logical, by-the-book approach that threatens Kirk's very career, while Quinto's Spock does a great job of trying--ultimately without success--to suppress his emotional, impulsive side. By the end of the movie, each of them has applied and learned the value of the other's approach, doing a bit of a role-reversal. Pine and Quinto manage to bring some real depth to this struggle. This is further accentuated by the fact that, as is often the case, the struggle is over matters that reflect current events. Do we arrest terrorists or treat them as legitimate targets of war? Can we cross international boundaries to get at them? Where do Kirk's and Spock's real duties lie? Where does revenge fit in, if it fits in at all?

The character who forces Kirk and Spock to wrestle with these issues, partly against their will, is the superb Benedict Cumberbatch, who gives the movie franchise some of its strongest acting ever. Cumberbatch is bound for great things, and he shows it in this role. Midway through the film he is revealed to be none other than Khan Noonien Singh, whom he plays with a dramatic intensity worthy of--and even exceeding--the performance of Ricardo Montalban. Khan is an intriguing character, and Cumberbatch takes him to a whole new level, his schemes consisting of wheels within wheels, becoming in at least one way like a sinister mirror image of Kirk. If Kirk's actions are justified by his concern for his crew, then aren't Khan's as well? A disturbing thought, given where Khan goes with it.

But that's not all. Karl Urban continues to channel DeForest Kelly's McCoy, even more successfully than in the previous film. He trades the inevitable barbs with Spock, but most of his relational development is with regard to Kirk in this film. Bruce Greenwood gives another strong, but all too brief, performance as Chritopher Pike. The rest of the Enterprise crew are in fine form as well.

One of the nicest touches for hard-core trekkies is how skillfully J. J. Abrams and the writers have woven Trek lore into the plot, and in a way that (mostly)  doesn't feel forced. Khan's appearance is foreshadowed by events that are clearly referenced in the original series as well as Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Carol Marcus slips deftly into the story line as well, providing in interesting link to the shadowy Section 31, the very mention of which warns us that all in this film will not be as it seems. And the reprise of the death scene from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is pulled off with great care. It could have been cheesy, an instance of Star Trek lampooning itself, but the result is anything but that. And in consequence, we get to see the genetically-engineered superman Khan in a knock-down flight with an enraged Vulcan. The only thing that felt a bit odd was a tribble as a lab rat. (How could you, McCoy?)

Of course, this isn't the original series. The actors are different; Abrams's' approach is different; the times are different. Nevertheless, Abrams has been true to the original in some core ways. And in this film, even more than the last, he's set himself a high bar for further entries in the franchise. Well done!",1368921600,20,3865,4.72700296735905
5294972,5,B009934S5M,"I am just back from the theater watching 'Star Trek Into Darkness' and I think that one word describes this movie - amazing.  I have seen many negative reviews, saying this movie was cliched, had too many special effects, and was too much of a knockoff on earlier plots.  To all of those who have seen this movie and didn't think it was wonderful I can say only one thing - you are not a true Star Trek fan.  I have been watching the show for close to 40 years and found this movie to be among the best of all the movies ever done in this series.

First of all, let's get some things out there.  The special effects were excellent.  The sound quality and music was phenomenal.  While I was concerned that there might be too much action in this movie, in reality I felt it fit very nicely into the plot and didn't overwhelm the movie.

The acting was great.  The characters who played the classic character parts from the 2009 movie all were stellar in their roles in this movie.  Some highlights included:

- a welcome expansion of Uhura's role in this movie (when you see her you will be happy she is on our side!!)

- the continued crotchetiness of McCoy, including one of his ""I'm a doctor, not a...."" comments

- another very humorous rendition of Scotty, including several classic comments

Benedict Cumberbatch was chilling as John Harrison (Khan), although I'm not sure he 'looked' the part of Khan,  given the incredible job that Ricardo Montalban did with this character in both the original ""Space Seed"" and in ""Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan"".  There were many other excellent performances, including the actors who played Admiral Pike, Admiral Marcus and Dr. Carol Marcus.

Now to the plot.  It was an ingenious reboot of the entire Khan space opera.  It took elements of the original episode and the movie and incorporated them into a new take on one of the best story concepts in the entire Star Trek franchise.  It also reminded one of the episodes from Star Trek : Enterprise where the Augments were first described.  The plot was very reminiscent of many things, including the entire Khan story, the notion of a senior Starfleet officer going bad (like ""The Pegasus"" in TNG), and the cinematic extravaganza that occurs near the end when Kirk sacrifices his own life to save the crew.  I think it is very interesting how in this reboot Kirk dies and Spock lives, while in TWOK, it was the other way around.  I enjoyed JJ Abrams' approach in solving this problem, so more movies could come forth from this one.

Most importantly, this movie did everything that a great Star Trek movie should do - it involved a great storyline, good character development, and a fully satisfying villain who the crew had to defeat.  It also paid homage to many things about Star Trek which made it so great.  It was funny, scary, action-packed, and riveting.  Even though you knew in the end that the crew would prevail, it didn't stop you from gripping the edge of your seat as you waited for it to happen.  Put simply, it caused Star Trek to shine yet again and I fully believe that Gene Roddenberry is looking down smiling about this one.

If you haven't seen the movie yet, please go see it and relax and enjoy it.  Don't overanalyze it or sit there and pick it apart.  Just watch the movie and be happy that there are people who love this franchise so much that they keep on making new movies.  I think that this movie will go down as among the best of the series.

Finally, I sincerely hope that at the end when it seems like the 5-year mission was going to be launched, that this means there will be more of these movies to come.  There are several great story lines from the original series that could use a fresh reboot, and I hope to see one of those someday.",1368921600,12,3769,4.461988304093567

Not to many movies have a great sequel so I would urge anyone why has not seen it yet to hop on over to theaters and go see it. Cant wait for the Blue Ray.",1368921600,6,479,3.8

The movie begins on the planet Niburu, where Jim breaks Starfleet regulations and gets busted back home.  Of course, Jim Kirk never stays busted for long.  Without telling you any spoilers, things escalate and we have the good guy-bad guy across-the-galaxy chase thing (as you expect).

If you can, catch this on the big screen, because the 3D jumps right off the screen in this movie.  It is one of those movies you just can't get up from your seat on --I know I sure couldn't. WELL worth the price of the movie ticket and well worth owning.",1368921600,4,810,4.462585034013605

Pros
-Awesome CGI and action sequences.
-Really solid acting by everyone. Pine and Quinto do a fantastic job playing Kirk and Spock respectively. Cumberbatch will make you wish the movie was an hour longer just so you can listen to him speak.
-Solid story line. Hardcore Trekies might hate one particular twist but, hey, haters gonna hate
-Well placed jokes! Hard to do in an action movie but the writers and actors did a great job here.
-See it on a big screen!!! The whole movie is ""big"" which is hard to describe. I saw it in IMAX and, honestly, this is one of the few films that takes advantage of the potential of that format.

Cons
-One cheesy scene... just a minor blemish.

Others have detailed the plot specifics so I will go with my own perspective as a lifelong Star Trek fan who started watching TOS in syndicated rerun in the mid-70's. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is my favorite Star Trek movie by far and it is in my list of the Top 10 films of all-time. So I was a bit concerned when I read the rumors on the Internet that Cumberbatch was going to reprise this iconic Science Fiction role in Star Trek: Into Darkness. I felt that JJ & company needed to do something different since they had created an alternate timeline with the first movie. I think the writing team had given lots of thought of parallel universes and how certain points and people are fixed in time in all possible universes. The work they did on Fringe pushed them to do several seasons worth of story about an alternate universe. Peter was their fixed person in the Fringe universe who impacted both realities. The writers looked at Khan the same way. I had to think about the plot threads of terrorism, betrayal, security, revenge, optimism, family and trust that were weaved through Into Darkness after seeing it Wednesday night. I then read the novelization and the prequel graphic novel to gain a better perspective before I went and watched the movie again today.

The main themes hit by this story are many such as Kirk being too young, impetuous, inexperienced, undisciplined, egotistical, etc., to command a starship effectively; Spock still suffering emotionally from the traumatic loss of his home-world and his mother while trying to connect with his erratic, emotional, impulsive Captain; Starfleet Command reacting badly to the devastating terror attack by Nero against Vulcan and Starfleet in the previous film causing Starfleet Command to turn to extraordinary extra-legal actions to bring security to the Federation despite undermining the very freedoms and ethics espoused by the Federation (Section 31); Scotty being the one crew member (besides Spock) willing to take a moral stand with Kirk over crossing the line of legality and ethics while Kirk & Starfleet are preoccupied with revenge against Khan.

So to me this wasn't a rehash of Wrath of Khan because that story was about coming to terms with growing older and feeling that life had passed you by. Kirk's past comes back to haunt him and the Enterprise and Kirk finally had to face his own Kobyashi Maru test with Spock's sacrifice. Khan was motivated by his need for vengeance against Kirk over the loss of his wife and being left marooned on a doomed planet. This too was an issue from Khan's past he could not let go and it was his undoing. ST:ID is about surviving the viccitudes of youth and learning from your mistakes to mature into a better sentient being connected to your friends and society. Kirk had Pike to place his faith and trust in him even when Kirk had royally screwed up from the hubris of flagrantly violating the Prime Directive on Nibiru even as Kirk failed to recognize this error. It took Pike's death and the pursuit of Khan to bring Kirk to the realization that he had to change his worldview and behavior.

Spock was struggling with his inner demons over the loss of Vulcan and his mother. He also made a personal journey of self-discovery in ST:ID especially after Kirk sacrificed himself to save the ship. Spock is filled with rage and pursues Khan with a fury never seen before. He helps save his friend Jim Kirk and he can now acknowledge this friendship and let it evolve.

Starfleet Command reacted like the US did after 9/11. They undermined their own principles in the name of imagined security. Admiral Marcus had sent out ships looking for resources to help Starfleet defend the Federation and they found the Botany Bay. Admiral Marcus thought he could exploit Khan's genetically engineered superior intellect and his capacity for violence to give the clandestine Section 31 (think CIA/Homeland Security/Special Forces) an advantage in building a capacity to take on the biggest perceived threat to the Federation for Admiral Marcus... the Klingon Empire. Thus you get the top-secret special prototype photon torpedoes and the built for combat USS Vengeance along with who knows what else that didn't get mentioned. You get incidents manipulated to provoke a state of war with the Klingons. All justified in the name of security.

Scotty was just awesome in this story. He was a moral compass while getting in on the action with the sabotage of the USS Vengeance. He also got some more great comedic scenes and lines. I was a bit disappointed that Bones didn't get more involved in this story but since it involved more technological issues I can see why Scotty was used rather than McCoy. Bones still got in some great metaphors and scenes and you know he can deliver Gorn babies in a crisis situation. Sulu gets a taste of the command chair and Checkov gets to flex his savant genius abilities as Scotty's replacement (temporarily) as Chief Engineer. Uhura has some issues with Spock, talks up some Klingons, battles some Klingons & makes some tough long distance calls. Getting a young Carol Marcus was cool and they didn't force her to be romantically involved with Kirk, She gets to join the crew and maybe they will hook up in the next installment. The Big E gets a refit to repair her battle damage and the crew of the USS Enterprise embark on the start of what should be an eventful, glorious and historic Five-Year Mission to Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before.

So I give Into Darkness a 9.235 out of 10. My biggest issue was with how long it took to warp to Kronos and then back to Earth. Unless warp speed had improved by a factor of 100 over the old Star Trek this was a plot device that was just way out of step with the rest of the movie. So other than that I am cool with the rest of the film elements as they were explained by the prequel graphic novel and in the novelization book for the film. I look forward to Star Trek 3 to come out in May of 2016 to be a part of the celebration of the 50th Anniversary of Star Trek!!!

**************DVD Release Addendum*************
I was really excited about the Blu-ray release of Into Darkness. I had read about the multitude of extras that JJ Abrams and his team shot for inclusion with the Blu-ray that would be exciting for the fans. Apparently the good folks in the marketing department at Paramount took a look at this treasure of bonus material and saw a way to extort the fans for even more profit. They struck deals to parcel out these bonus features to different retailers forcing fans to buy a plethora of copies to collect all of the bonus features. I didn't cancel my order because this isn't Amazon's fault and I do want the awesome phaser. I won't be buying these extra copies to line Paramount's pockets full of gold-pressed latinum. Actually, if Paramount had an ounce of integrity they would make a public apology for trying to screw over the fans of Star Trek who have made them profits that would make a Ferengi blush and offer a Blu-ray disc with the bonus material to make up for this error in judgement.

The website Digital Bits is where I was alerted to this shameful avarice. It stated the following: ""Yes... the seven featurettes listed in the press release are basically everything you get on the disc, aside from the usual DVD copy, Digital Copy, UltraViolet copy, Xerox copy and what not.  The featurettes amount to about 42 minutes of EPK-style behind the scenes material.  There's no commentary, no deleted scenes, no trailers... which would be bad enough.

Except...

It turns out that more extras were created for this release - more featurettes and even an audio commentary with director J.J. Abrams and members of his crew.  None of it is available on the wide release Blu-ray or Blu-ray 3D SKUs.  The commentary can only be found as an iTunes ""extra"" download.  And those extra featurettes?  Some are on a Target bonus disc.  Some are on a Best Buy bonus disc.  And some are only available via CinemaNow and VUDU downloads. That's right: More than half of the special features created for Star Trek Into Darkness were used by Paramount's marketing team as retailer exclusives. It's a terrible way to treat your consumers, who are sometimes spending $30 or more for a Blu-ray, expecting to get a little genuine value for their money.  And no, six different versions of the exact same movie isn't value.  If you're a serious Blu-ray enthusiast - or for that matter a Star Trek fan of any kind - all you care about when you buy a Blu-ray is getting the movie in pristine quality with lots of extras.  Though its A/V quality is exceptional, in all other respects the Star Trek Into Darkness Blu-ray is an insult.""

5294979,5,B009934S5M,"Star Trek: Into Darkness is a more than worthy successor to the 2009 JJ Abrams reboot with its exciting and heart-pounding storyline, eye-popping special effects, much-welcomed humor, and a jelling of the characters.  Using source material from earlier Trek movies, this installment ends up being a Trek fan's delight as they pick out well-known quotes, new yet familiar characters, and in an ultimate nod to sci-fi geeks everywhere......borrowing an actor from the Doctor Who universe for a pivotal opening role.

Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) is still trying to fit the mold of what other's think makes a good Captain and struggling mightily.  When the chips are down and he's thrust into doing what others can't do is when his true understanding of what a Captain must do becomes clear in a few unexpectedly emotional scenes.  Emotional scenes show up at the most unexpected times in fact as Spock (Zachary Quinto) struggles with his human side in his dealings of friendship with Kirk and his continuing romance with Uhura (Zoe Saldana).  Quinto is quickly making the role his own as he seamlessly blends his Vulcan logic with the human emotions of fear, anger, and love and had me focusing on him every time he came on screen.  Scotty (Simon Pegg) too left his mark in this film through some perfectly timed humor and subtle way of reminding everyone the true vision of Star Trek is to explore.  Talk and acts of war put a modern spin on the tale and creates extra tension and philosophical issues to ponder long after the movie is over.

Benedict Cumberbatch makes for a compelling villain, at once violent and untrustworthy and yet sympathetic too.  His real identity isn't revealed until the latter part of the movie but true Trek fans have known all along who he was.  He and Kirk make a formidable team when forced into working together and even scarier enemies when staring each other down.  His storyline is wrapped up but definitely leaves room for a return appearance.  Female moviegoers hoping for some kick ass heroines will be somewhat satisfied as Uhura gets to be more than Spock's girlfriend in this film showing a few fight skills of her own.  I wish the other new female character of Carol Marcus (who Trek fans know from the mythology) had fared as well.  She's a runaway daughter who tries to use tears to end a battle when not coyly flirting with Kirk.  I both dread seeing her again but know it's inevitable so I hope for someone much stronger next time around.

JJ Abrams' script had one or two obvious moments, but on a whole kept me on the edge of my seat.  The special effects were truly impressive and weren't done merely for show.  The cast/crew really meshed in this movie as you could sense their closeness, their sense of friends and family.  The dialogue was fast-paced with flashes of humor and intense emotions and I would love to see this film again as I feel I might have missed some of the nuances keeping up with the dialogue. Abrams has created another loving tribute to the Star Trek universe and we fans are the ones being rewarded in this immensely satisfying, sure to be a summer blockbuster, film.",1368921600,15,3140,4.717948717948718

5294981,2,B009934S5M,"This review contains spoilers...

I was not keen on the 'let's reboot Star Trek by rewriting the past', but a friend took me to see the reboot and I enjoyed it (despite the weak plot). However, Into Darkness was a huge disappointment.  Lots of people love it; I have to assume they have a 5 minute attention span.

I saw this in 3D. Some of the 3D effects look more like sloppy camerawork, like the orange blur partly obscuring Kirk's face in the bar scene. But Abrams seems to think crappy camerawork is a 'style', like his abuse of lens flare that I'll mention later.

We start with the Enterprise - a STAR ship - hiding in the sea, while Spock attempts to stop a volcano exploding and destroying the stone age native aliens. This is a case of sloppy writing, we need a quick way for Spock to face death which will be needed later in the movie - sort of. I would like to point out that the transporters won't work in this situation unless there is line of sight with Spock (the transporters regularly won't work in this movie, conveniently). The Enterprise should have been in orbit around the planet, but wasn't because it was important for Kirk to forego the Prime Directive to save Spock. We don't see the aliens again; they're a convenience for later in the movie.

Kirk is then demoted for trying to save the aliens, ignoring the Prime Directive AND saving Spock, although I don't know why, as it won't be long before he's captain of the Enterprise again.

There's then a long exposition of our bad guy. A member of Starfleet has a sick child that is dying. Our bad guy's blood can save her (I suppose blood types are irrelevant in the future). But in exchange for his daughter's life, this member of STARFLEET will kill himself and dozens of his fellow starfleet personnel. I might possibly go for an ordinary person doing this, but I can't believe a starfleet officer would kill his friends and colleagues and leave his child without a father to save his daughters life.  More sloppy writing to move the story along, and in case you missed something we will be shown again later.

There's a meeting of the top brass that our bad guy manages to shoot up, killing admiral Pike and making Kirk captain again.

Things do get better for a while as the Enterprise goes off to kill our bad guy, but Spock suggests revenge isn't a good thing. Our bad guy is in Klingon space...we meet the Klingons, capture the bad guy and discover that he's Khan (although regrettably not Ricardo Montalban) who tells us that some folk in Starfleet aren't good guys either.

Peter Weller is a great addition to the cast as Admiral Marcus. It seems he wants to start a war with the Klingons. He isn't too pleased to find Kirk hasn't killed Khan and started a war with the Klingons, because he has conveniently built a big, fast, powerful evil looking attack starship. He's going to destroy the Enterprise instead (that had a convenient warp drive malfunction). But wait! The admiral's daughter is on the Enterprise! We have a little on screen exchange between father and daughter. This is where I want to tie up and torture Abrams. The man is positively fetishistic about lens flare. I wonder if it gives him erotic stimulation. The lens flare here is so overdone you can't even see actress Alice Eve's face; the lens flare fills the screen and threatens to blind the audience. The admiral has better transporters by the way.

The big bad evil admiral's starship is so advanced it can follow the Enterprise and even fire on it travelling at warp. But Scottie - played by the truly annoying Simon Pegg - is in a convenient position to disable the admiral's ship (don't ask how, thats more embarassingly bad writing). The transporters aren't working again, so we are offered another action sequence as Kirk and Khan jump from ship to ship. Khan gets control of the big bad ship, I seem to recall that the transporters are then suddenly working again so our heroes can be beamed off, Enterprise is damaged in combat and with no engine power is going to burn up as it crashes towards earth. Kirk fixes the engines and dies of the radiation. I guess this is the point where Spock's earlier brush with death is supposed to have been meaningful as he watches Kirk through the glass, as in The Wrath of Khan.  Unfortunately, the homage to 'The Wrath of Khan' is so emotionally weak it's watered down to homeopathic dilution. You can't cook up the friendship Kirk and Spock had in the original series with a few convenient moments.  And unless you were half asleep, you know that Kirk isn't properly dead, because a little while earlier, McCoy had conveniently mentioned that he had injected Khan's blood into a DEAD tribble. It doesn't take an IQ of 200 to guess where this is going.

Lots more excitement as the big evil starship crashes into San Francisco, but Khan survives. Oh no, those pesky Enterprie transporters are malfunctioning AGAIN!!!  We can't get a fix on Khan and beam him up, but hey, Spock, we can beam you down!  After a good old fashioned punch up and with the help of Uhura Khan is captured, his blood injected into Kirk, and the galaxy is safe once again.

In case you missed it, the movie is supossed to be a message about terrorism. Sorry folks, this movie was BAD. I give it two stars because I've seen worse movies, Karl Urban is in it, and I didn't walk out.",1368921600,24,5361,4.538860103626943

 Those who know me have heard umpteen times my saying about original ideas in the movies (they don't exist, only original ways of telling them).  This is particularly true when doing a reboot/remake/sequel; you have a universe that has already been set up, now how do you give the audience something different while still playing within the limits of that universe?  The Star Trek reboot I thought was one that got it right, and if that wasn't enough, they reset the universe in such a way that they could pretty much do whatever they wanted.

 And what did they do with this opportunity?  They lamely ripped off a previous entry in the franchise, threw in some glaring logic holes and a preachy message, while producer/director J.J. Abrams forced some hammy overacting out of the villain.

 LAME RIP-OFFS

 The previous entry they ripped off was ""Star Trek II:  Wrath of Khan"", and they ripped off the ending, but only swapped the roles between Kirk and Spock, and if that wasn't enough, Spock screams Khan's name after Kirk dies, just Kirk did when Khan taunted him in the original.

 LOGIC ERRORS

 How does an armed ship fly up to Starfleet Headquarters and proceed to blow away a meeting of admirals?  Where's security (especially since it occurred right after a ""terrorist"" attack)?

 How does Scotty manage to fly into an enemy base by pulling the old ""Let's Blend in with the Drones"" trick?  Where's their security?

 THEME PROBLEMS

 The ""terrorist attack"" clearly parallels the terrorist situation of today and so we're clubbed over the head with a debate on how to respond to them.  I know this debate will never end, and I can see both sides of this issue, but did the writers have to be so blatant about it?  This was the reason I hate ""Avatar"" so much, but at least this movie only hit us over the head twice.

 HAMMY OVERACTING

 Before this movie, I had never heard of Benedict Cumberbatch, the actor playing the villain.  I then saw him in a BBC TV series ""Sherlock"" (an example of a reboot done right), and could see he was the right man for the job.  In the trailers, he oozed menace out of the simplest lines like ""Now, shall we begin?"".  That was clearly his best line, because the rest of his deliveries were so hammy I was waiting for some eggs to show up.

 RECOMMENDATIONS

 As I previously mentioned, BBC's ""Sherlock"", a modern-day update of the one-man CSI lab, is an example of a remake done right.  Benedict owns the role, and the writers really challenged the character while still staying faithful to the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.",1368921600,53,2642,4.638528138528138

""You are a pawn, Kirk. You can't even guarantee the safety of your own crew.""

There's no denying 2013 is a good year to be a sci-fi fan. Offerings like Oblivion, After Earth, Pacific Rim, and Riddick all promise to keep fans of the genre quite happy. However, it's J.J. Abrams' sequel to his masterful 2009 Star Trek reboot that is arguably the most anticipated release of the year, and rightfully so.

The 2009 film was an accomplishment; successfully modernizing the series while remaining decidedly true to what Star Trek is expected to be. Now, four years later, does the sequel, ""Into Darkness"" live up to its' predecessor?

That all depends on what sort of film you want to see.

If you're all in for an action-filled, gut-wrenching adventure featuring the cast and characters you love from the reboot, then this is the movie for you.

The sound design is some of the best I've experienced in recent memory. From photon blasts to screeching metal to warp drives, it's unbelievably immersive. Jarring, subtle, soothing, adrenaline inducing, loud, it's what sound in a film like this should be.  Everything - even simple punches - have a weight and realness to them that is often overlooked in films.

This beauty extends to the musical score as well. Haunting melodies and rising crescendos are superbly placed to manipulate the mood to exactly what the viewer needs to feel at the time, whether that be wonder, dread, or excitement.

The returning cast members - from Pine to Urban to Quinto to Pegg to the superb Bruce Greenwood - are every bit what they were in Star Trek 2009, and have arguably improved in their roles.

Quinto's Spock has noticeably grown, as has Urban's Bones McCoy. Pine's Kirk is a less explicit progression, but has successfully shaken some of the annoying frat-boy persona he exhibited in Trek 2009, which in itself is an accomplishment I can applaud.

The new cast members serve their roles for the most part - minus Alice Eve, who seems perfectly content to act as a hollow shell placed in the film to be nothing but eye candy.

Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan, on the other hand, is a force to be reckoned with; Vastly superior to 1982's Khan - played by Ricardo Montalban, this new Khan is a sight to behold.

Equally menacing and relatable, there were many instances in the film that I truly felt for him and thought he was justified in his villainous actions. Cumberbatch's brooding, emotional portrayal is one the better characters in the series history, and I can only hope he'll somehow be used again in the future. As engaging as he was, the final turn-about of his character arc was sadly predictable.

That is where we come to the bulk of what is wrong with ""Into Darkness""

For all its victories, the film was almost too familiar for a returning fan like myself.

It leans on its source material - 1982's aforementioned ""The Wrath of Khan"" - like an ugly crutch, all too often borrowing plot points and twists in unneeded ways.

2009's reboot also did this, but in a far less greedy way, and ultimately managed to be original and surprising. ""Into Darkness"" does not succeed in this regard.

While the story is serviceable; if you're an old fan, chances are you've seen a lot of it before. This means many of the scenes meant to evoke shock or suspense may ring hollow, because you already know the outcome.

 On occasion, Abrams has an inspired stroke, and instead of lifting a plot point, turns it on its head and gives us a legitimate twist that we can appreciate, but too often he eschews this in favor of trying to play to our nostalgia.

I was much more impressed with Oblivion's story line and unique ideas than I was with the script of ""Into Darkness"", which is rather sad. Star Trek has always been more of a thinking-man's sci-fi, but this new film falls squarely in the action/thriller department. If you're looking for a good thought-provoking romp through the future, I recommend Oblivion.

Overall, ""Into Darkness"" is lacking in comparison to its older brother - and it seems to its competition this year as well. I will give credit to its final act, which was superbly engaging and had a pair of wonderfully executed twists - though they may be lost on newcomers to the series.

The film is lots of fun, and if your introduction to the universe was the 2009 Trek, then you will likely be perfectly satisfied with this merely adequate sequel, but if you're a veteran of the world, you may be a tad disappointed.

In closing, I cannot help but feel let down. Into Darkness was engaging while it lasted and had plenty of great moments. The humor was frequent enough that it prevented things from ever becoming too dark, while also keeping it's distance during the most dire of situations; and as previously stated the final act of the film was a superb ride.

Yet, there are so many little things that while competent, were not astounding. So much potential literally brimming around the surface of the display, but never being fully realized. Does it deserve a place in your collection? Yes, though perhaps not on your ""classics"" shelf. ""Into Darkness"" will find itself much more comfortable alongside contemporaries like Prometheus or Terminator : Salvation.

5294986,5,B009934S5M,"OK folks first of all, this is a movie.  J.J. is not trying to re-invent the wheel here. What J.J. Abrams has accomplished here is to re-imagine a burned out brand and series (that I loved as much as any true fan) and  had the guts to go where no director has gone before with it.  He shows his total respect for the best of the previously done films, his respect for the fans of the original films, and bravely creates a marvelous environment for the future of this series.  I cannot tell you the last time I have sit in a darkened movie theater (full of fans and first timers) and had so much fun listening to the audience ooh and aah at what they were seeing and hearing from the screen. I along with them laughed, oohed, aah-ed, and even shed a tear, as this movie unfolded, and cannot remember the last time I felt so satisfied in seeing a film.

  To all of the families with teens and tweens out there, Yes! this is the whole family movie experience you've been waiting for (and to be fair, there are some really intense scenes, and a four letter word uttered, but you just know the character would really say it in the heat of the moment) !!! It Is Fun! The cast is pitch perfect, the look, sound, and feel of ""Into Darkness"" is a joy to behold, and a loving homage to all of us who loved the original characters and films, and to those of us who just love good old fashion science fiction. It is a first class roller coaster ride and a true challenge to film makers to up the ante for audiences, if you want us to continue to shell out the movie bucks. By the way, this is a repeater for me as I will go back to see it again.

To J.J. Abrams and your entire crew, Thank You! for being so fearless, so brave to tweak and tamper with a sci-fi original, and re-remind me why I like to go to the movies. I think that Gene Roddenberry would be so proud of your take on his universe.

To the entire cast, Thank You! for being true to the original actors and characters, for giving them your spin, and making the roles your own. I have not had this much fun in a movie theater in a long, long, time, and in a galaxy far, far, away.  BRAVO !!!

And to those of you that are leaving such horrid and negative comments to my review, WAKE UP!!  These are MOVIES that we are talking about.  I now understand why some actors  comment at some point in their careers,  about some fans needing to get a life.  Movies are not real life changing events.  They are meant for ALL of us to ENJOY (or not)for the two or three hours we sit in that theater, and maybe learn a little something  (or not).  Movies allow us to escape our sometimes droll and stressful lives for just a moment, to fantasize, to dream for a moment, to forget how different our lives have become.  If you don't like or feel the same  way about a movie as I do, I understand.  But understand this, I don't try to keep people from seeing, renting, or buying a film because I don't like it, nor do I spend my time trying to drag someone else down because their opinion is different from mine.

I saw this film and I had Fun!! It took me back to the early days of Bart Sloane (The 4D Man - The Blob), Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts), and Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey) when special effects were in their infancy.  I felt the same way when I saw my first Steven Spielberg film (Jaws), my first Ridley Scott movie (Alien), George Lucas (Star Wars), and now J.J. Abrams.  These are but a minute few of the hundreds of great filmmakers (I could go on forever)that have gone the extra mile to entertain us, to give us a break from the real world that is so full of Intolerance, Hate, Fear, Hunger, Struggle, and Disease.  Give them a break guy's, they are just making movies for us to enjoy (or not).

Remember, the world will still turn tomorrow, that is unless God decides that he has had enough of us, and the way we treat each other, and decides to just shake us off of this little blue planet that some of us do not appreciate or respect at all.",1368921600,"1,004",4021,4.168175937904269
5294987,5,B009934S5M,"4 years, almost to the date, any concerns fans had over Paramount Studio's decision to reboot the initial Star Trek `Enterprise & Crew' were, within the first 30 minutes dispelled, and a new generation and legions of new fans embraced the concept of `new faces' to the `old characters'.

All associated with this project are due credit for successfully rebooting and breathing new life into a tired franchise. The real credit resides with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci who's homage to the initial Star Trek, highlighted by the presence of Lenoard Memoy, complete with a clever alternate time line and universe, allowed J.J. Abrams' the opportunity to mine the history of the Star Trek universe, and unfettered by the history and short comings of the previous movies, allowed the same characters to be developed in a different arc.

With the same crew in-front of and behind the camera from the first outing, Star Trek into Darkness with a longer running time, affords greater character development and screen time to each member of the Enterprise. In the process each actor elevates the status and depth of their characters and in the process finally lay to rest, the ghost of, and, any comparisons to the initial cast and crew.

The show here belongs to, and is focused on the central relationship between Chris Pine's Kirk and Zachary Quinto's Spock, their emerging friendship, and the impact and cost this relationship will have on each character and each other.

Credit once again must go to Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Damon Lindelof who's story and script anchors this film with the characters and their relationship, and do not allow the spectacular, non-stop action, and dynamic set pieces to overshadow the real story, which is one of relationships, and the cost and price friendship can demand. This is no simple achievement, but is the basis on which this film will be categorised as either good, great, or, brilliant.

J.J. Abrams continuing foray into this genre, is nothing short of spectacular! His ability to not only maintain, but improve on his re-booting of Star Trek is a phenomenal achievement, and testament to his skill as a visionary story teller and action director, which are the real reasons that Disney and George Lucas went out of their way to secure his Directorial Services for the forthcoming Star Wars IIV.

The barometer for Star Trek into Darkness should not be measured against Star Trek, but against the recently released Iron Man 3 which appears to be the movie that all 2013 releases will be gauged. In this face-off, Star Trek into Darkness casts the longer shadow, and on all aspects of movie making, can be counted as the best movie thus far in 2013.

Prior to concluding, particular mention must go to the `Supporting Cast', especially Bruce Greenwood, in a limited but career best performance, ably supported by Peter Weller However, the real star of Star Trek is Benedict Cumberbatch, who's screen presence is 3D even in 2D. Every frame, each perfectly enunciated syllable and facial nuance is one of pure intensity, malevolence and distain that would send a shiver down the spine of Hannibal Lecter (even on a second viewing). This follows on from his excellent and measured performance in Cloud Atlas, his spectacular ownership of Sherlock Holmes, and the as yet unknown performance in The Hobbit Trilogy!

In conclusion, STAR TREK into DARKNESS is a spectacular movie, a rare achievement, matched only by the calibre of talent in front of, and behind the lens, and is an indictment of a director with a limited number of peers. This is a movie that can be deemed a companion and equal to movies such as The Dark Knight Rises, Blade Runner, The Lives of Others, Alien, Shawshank Redemption.

5294988,1,B009934S5M,"After leaving the IMAX theater yesterday morning, I was angry with this film.  As with the first in the reboot, it had some pretty serious science faux pas for anyone even mildly familiar with physics, astrophysics, stellar cartography, etc.  But, more importantly, this isn't 'Star Trek'.  It shares the name and found some decent actors to fill pre-existing roles, sure... but everything that made the varying series and movies 'trekkie' -- the undertones of hopefulness, optimistic human aspiration in the face of challenges, moral growth, and even exploration of somewhat relevant technological ideas that had already inspired more than one generation to 'boldly go' and invent many of the things they saw in the original and following series -- all sidelined in the name of action, be it social reforms, cell phones, hyposprays, 80% of folk working at NASA during one inquiry in the early 90s, I think, and dozens more things whose innovators point back to the show they watched as a child for having inspired them to do such things.

This reboot has lost ~all~ of that, and topped it with a thick and sour sauce of bad science and conceptual black holes that any first year physics student could have helped the director/writers patch up.  Even as far as an action movie goes (presuming you took away the good name and just slapping any old thing on it) it is fairly shallow material.  Nonstop action, explosions, etc.  It's Die Hard in space... except space is terribly represented.

I have had opportunity to enjoy other J.J. Abrams works in the past (his 'Super 8', for example, had so much of what Trek used to have and has now been lost)... Still... he is not worthy of Trek and should never have been allowed anywhere near it.  I have great difficulty imagining that Roddenbury would have taken this in stride.  I thought the rewiring of history was a great way to explain a reboot... but... couldn't he have held on to any of the high minded, creative, and optimistic ideals that the originals held fast to?

Having grown up on this stuff, this may be hitting me harder than it will anyone from the newest generation... but take any thing you hold to high regard and imagine it remade in any way you appreciate the least and you'll have a hint at the given rating.  Stick a spiked mace and rugged shield in the arms of the Statue of Liberty for an equivalent corruption of original intent.",1368921600,72,2402,4.720095693779904
5294989,5,B009934S5M,"The Short: Featuring a strong and incredibly dynamic cast that is both well acted and written, a grandeur of delicious special effects and an incredible sense of pacing to match the first, JJ Abrams returns with ""Into Darkness"" only to (nearly) out-do himself.

9.25/10

Ah, the summer movie season. The time when we are blown away by grand demonstrations of digital artists, loud and booming explosions, and silly excuses for characters and story thrown into the mix. It's a summer movie clich&eacute;; one that is fun, yet unfulfilling. You could be easily skeptical of the sequel to one of 2009's best films, Star Trek, but have no fear...JJ Abrams is back in action.

Into Darkness has come early in the summer movie season, but I'm sure it is going to be a favorite pick for most movie goers and also Trek fans. For me, it's definitely going to be one of the 2013 summer blockbusters to judge all others, simply because it does nearly everything right.

Returning with a phenomenal cast, Into Darkness goes for a more character driven piece this time, which succeeds in almost every way. The whole cast, from Kirk to Spock (Pine and Quinto), Scotty to Chekov (Pegg and Yelchin), I could go on and on...the whole cast rocks. Dashes of great humor and stupendous writing are the strong points here, with each and every character having their shining ""moment."" Cumberbatch, our villain this time around, is also fantastic, featuring an intense and believable performance that doesn't feel clich&eacute; or silly. Above all else one of my favorites, Scotty, gets plenty of screen time and steals the show in nearly every scene. It's only some of the newer faces on the Enterprise are simply ""there"", but it's cool to see so many different characters get a chance in the limelight. The character driven story could've fallen apart, but gladly the characters are written even better this time around and are heroes you'll want to root for.

The story of Into Darkness is nothing ""new"", but it's far from boring and dull. Featuring some interesting twists and incredible action set pieces, the story told is one that could've easily been rudimentary but is instead smart and exciting. While the plot of the original is a little ""thrown in there"", the plot here is more essential to the experience, it's just a little less original. There are a couple of plot holes, mainly when getting closer to the ending, but it doesn't distract...it simply (and sadly) mars an incredible experience.

The visual effects wizards that Abrams commands are also back, with some incredibly delicious results. Ships look gorgeous, phasers and guns look vibrant and cool, and the action sequences are FANTASTIC. Abrams trademark style shines here too, with some sequences that are pretty simple but are shot in such fantastically cool ways that it's impossible not to be glued to your seat. There are also some simply gorgeous shots, from great use of rack focusing and quick zooms to create a sense of realism in even the most CGI enhanced scenes.

The soundtrack (composed by the wonderful Michael Giacchino) is perfect. The theme is incredible, Khan's theme is excellent, and the booming percussion will get your blood pumping. The sound effects are loud and in your face, but you also never lose the intimacy of an important dialogue moment. It's edited to perfection (in theaters).

It's only a couple of plot holes and the lack of ""freshness"" that made the original so incredible that keeps Into Darkness just shy of greatness. It's the characters and thrilling story that keeps you glued to your chair, which arguably is more important and thus makes Into Darkness the superior entry in the series.

As for now, Into Darkness is a truly spectacular 2nd act for the Enterprise and crew, one that takes their relationships to the breaking point and truly tests both the cast and Abrams once again to return and try top themselves once again. Into Darkness doesn't boldly go where no film has gone before, but it is surely one of the most solid sequels that Hollywood has dished out in recent memory.

But I'll stand by this: What a fantastic way to begin the summer movie season.

5294990,5,B009934S5M,"From my wife Sarah: I've been a fan of Star Trek since the first series. This movie was excellent.

Here's why:

- The story was engaging, exciting, and had plenty of edge of your seat moments.

- The way it wove the new story together using prior movie and TV themes to build on was kind of genius. Those who know Star Trek will enjoy that.

- It had humor with a few good laughs and chuckles, but it also brought tears to my eyes.

- I loved the way they developed the relationships between the main characters, especially between Spock and Kirk. I very much disagree with the poster who said there wasn't enough character development. I felt it was quite the opposite.

- There were surprises. Especially one big one, which I won't reveal. I enjoyed that this movie wasn't predictable.

- The casting was spot on. It's so believable that these are the young versions of Spock, Kirk, etc.

- The acting was superb.

What else can you want!

I saw it at an IMAX 3-D theater, and I'd highly recommend that. The 3-D was phenomenal on this huge screen. There were moments when I could imagine I was in space.

I think that Star Trek fans, as well as those who are new to Star Trek, will enjoy the movie. You really don't have to know Star Trek history to enjoy this movie, but if you are familiar, you'll get a lot more out of it.

So Star Trek fans shouldn't miss this new addition. I also recommend this movie to all scifi and action fans. I'll be purchasing this movie when it becomes available, and I'm sure I'll watch it many times.",1368835200,676,1535,4.310104529616725

After a mission has gone bad, Captain James Kirk is demoted to first officer of the Enterprise, with his predecessor, Admiral Christopher Pike reassuming command. When Starfleet is attacked by John Harrison, Kirk and his crew journey to a Klingon planet in search for Harrison. What follows is an all out war with Harrison, the Klingons, and a rogue Admiral.

5294992,4,B009934S5M,"Into Darkness is better than the last cartoony yet enjoyable relaunch from 2009, but it seems to be trying to hard to feel like a Star Trek film. It doesn't help that the story this time around is far from original. Still, it is a lot of fun with great CGI, good acting and a nice dose of humor. Benedict Cumberbatch makes for a strong villain due to his still gaze and deep voice, though he fails to measure up to the charisma that Ricard Montalban brought to the role of Khan.

I would still take The Wrath of Khan, The Undiscovered Country or First Contact any day over these last two entries, but they do have a wide appeal and in my opinion are more enjoyable than the last two Iron Man movies.

After watching Into Darkness it's no wonder that J.J. Abrams is taking over the other epic Sci-Fi saga, which is his true love anyways. It really shows.

5294994,5,B009934S5M,"In order to appreciate this film, one must be familiar with the original series as well as the film series. To talk about the plot is pointless, other than to say Khan is back. Benedict Cumberbatch is a rather boring Khan who lacks the exotic look and class of Ricardo Montalban. Fortunately the cast of regulars can carry the film.

The film also introduces Carol Marcus (Alice Eve). In the original film version Carol Marcus was an early conquest of Kirk (Chris Pine). She would have his child, a son who was ultimately killed by Klingons. If you have never seen the Khan film, then the juxtapositions in this film will be meaningless and the genius and enjoyment hindered.

Another aspect of the early series is that it was reflective of the era with Klingons representing Russia and Romulans being China. That symbolism is meaningless today, so our writers cleverly use the aspect of terrorism as a way to maintain the original flavor of the series. Likewise the character of James Kirk, who did things on hunches and ""out of the box"" is maintained in this film, perhaps the only real reason we tolerated Shatner in that role in the first place.

Dialogue is recycled. Zachary Quinto captures Spock. The role of Uhura has been expanded and Zoe Saldana kicks a lot of women to the curb. Bones (Karl Urban) still throws out the metaphors. Simon Pegg still needs to work on Scotty. John Cho is working hard to fill the big shoes of Sulu, whose stardom has multiplied as an Amazon reviewer. There is mention of Nurse Christine Chapel from the original TV and film series which didn't fit into the plot, perhaps a clue to the next script, or maybe I missed something. Perhaps some nice Trekkie could toss me a bone on this one in the comments section and I can edit this review.

Be warned, there is zero character introduction. If you don't know who these characters are, the film will just be a special effects meh. The picture has its light moments, but I thought could use some more. Hopefully the next film we can re-introduce Harry Mudd a Star Trek favorite who made two episode appearances.

5294995,3,B009934S5M,"The rumors about Khan being the antagonist in this latest 'Star Trek' have been swirling for months.  Now that it's no longer a rumor, I was curious to see how they would make this plausible in the new 'Trek' timeline.  In the Original Series, Khan's exile ship, the Botany Bay. was found adrift in space by Kirk and crew sometime during the original 5 year mission.  After a failed takeover of the Enterprise, Khan and his genetically superior supermen and women are exiled to Ceti Alpha V, a desolate planet, but a chance at a new start.  This sets the stage for perhaps the greatest Trek film of them all, 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'.

I thought the script's challenge was plausibly explaining Khan's emergence earlier in this timeline.  On this level, the explanation was deftly handled.  Supporting cast members are given much more to do in this film, especially Simon Pegg's Scotty and John Cho's Sulu.  But the film ultimately is not very original.  Without giving away too much in the neighborhood of spoilers, the film feels too much like a re-write of 'Star Trek II'.  There are specific plotpoints, characters, and dialogue that are lifted directly from not only 'Star Trek II' but also from 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'.

As for Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan, I know he's getting rave reviews and he does do a nice job.  But he's not making me forget Ricardo Montalban anytime soon.  The character is supposed to be from the Indian subcontinent.  Montalban, of Spanish-Mexican decent, was able to bring a certain gravitas to the role, something that resonates almost 50 years later.  By making Khan a caucasian Englishman, I think it makes it hard to accept him in the role.  Alice Eve as Carol Marcus with an inexplicable British accent is another hurdle I had difficulty with. Before I am accused of nitpicking, I'd like to point out that I enjoy the primary cast in their roles.  With the exception of Zachary Quinto's Spock, the actors physically look distinctive from their Original Series counterparts.

The casual Star Trek fan will enjoy the film.  The diehard fan will be entertained as long as the inconsistencies are ignored.  There will be another Star Trek film.  Hopefully, there will be a new Star Trek TV series based on the extensive glimpses of Star Fleet Command and Star Fleet Academy we see in this film.",1368748800,7,2354,4.7772277227722775

Its less a film than a fan event or a recreation. This might be excused in the first film, But two films in and there is really no original story to speak of. By the audience reaction, lots of red meat was being thrown to the fans. But it didn't mean much to me.

Benedict Cumberbatch has no charisma in a part that required it. Compared to the first film, the action scenes were either derivative or unimaginative. The battle in space was the usual non-event with an uneven match up. The ""Boiler room"" design of the ship is really starting to get old as is hanging around earth all the time.

Much like Star Wars, Star Trek has always had an adoring and devoted legion of fans that will line up around the block for a seat to watch the newest space adventure regardless of who's starring in it, who's directing it, etc.  However, it's not just Trekkies that are standing in line anymore.  Since J.J. Abrams took over the director's chair in 2009, he's returned the struggling franchise to prominence, possibly making it more popular than ever before.  With the successful reimagining of these classic characters, devoted fans and new fans alike have been filled with anticipation for the sequel - but Star Trek sequels haven't always met expectations.  In fact, half of Star Trek's (original series and Next Generation) sequels have been downright deplorable.  So, does J.J. Abrams have what it takes to make a successful Star Trek sequel?

Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) return in the explosive sequel, Star Trek: Into Darkness, on a manhunt to capture former Starfleet Commander, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch).  After terrorizing London and murdering a group of Starfleet officers, Harrison flees to Qo'noS, the Klingon home world.  Kirk instantly volunteers the Enterprise and its crew to do whatever is necessarily to bring the terrorist to judgment.  Karl Urban, John Cho, Zoe Saldana, Alive Eve, Anton Yelchin, and Simon Pegg also star in supporting roles.

No Spoilers...Yet.

As far as the entertainment value goes, there really isn't anything not to like about Star Trek: Into Darkness.  The film begins with action-packed drama (much like the first film), and really never slows down until the credits roll.  It's filled with plenty of twists and turns, along with several appearances by characters that will be familiar to fans of the original series.  From the film's synopsis alone, obviously the Klingons play a part in the storyline, yet it's only a very brief introduction as the inner turmoil in Starfleet is the main focus of the film - along with the introduction to film's partial antagonist, John Harrison.  The lines between the good and evil is easily visible in the film, but the main problem throughout the film is the feeling of nostalgia - as if you've already seen this film once before.  Into Darkness does serve as a parallel to the original Star Trek film series, yet this sequel still feels a bit recycled when comparing it to the 2009 film.  The good news is this is about the closest thing to a complaint that you'll find about this movie.

It's nearly impossible to go into detail about the plot points of this film without spoiling something for someone, so from here on out - you've been warned.

Spoilers start HERE.

The majority of the hype surrounding Into Darkness was in regards to the villain, John Harrison.  Since these new Star Trek films are still a part of the official continuity (now an alternate reality), you'd think Star Trek fans would have some kind of knowledge about this character - yet there was nothing to be found.  Of course, this prompted the speculation about the possibility that this John Harrison character could really be Khan Noonien Singh.  If you were one of those people that made this call early on, you were right.  John Morrison is indeed that same villain that was such a massive thorn in William Shatner's side in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.  And, since the timeline has been altered, a new storyline was constructed in order for the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise to cross paths with Khan and his followers.

Unlike the easily noticeable charm of Ricardo Montalbn, there's not much to like about Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of the character.  Into Darkness' version of Khan clearly cares about his fellow augmented brothers and sisters, but he has no reason to hold a grudge against Captain Kirk like he did in The Wrath of Khan, which takes a great deal of emotion out of this new sequel.  The majority of the enjoyment that came from The Wrath of Khan was due largely to the revenge Khan felt compelled to inflict on Kirk, but when you remove that particular emotion from the equation, it needs to be replaced with something else entirely - hence the introduction to Admiral Alexander Marcus as a second antagonist.  Sadly, Marcus' desire to take the Federation into an unavoidable war, long before the Federation is prepared isn't really a visible motive to build an entire film around.  It leads to more action, but isn't necessarily the best road taken, even though it was necessary if the third film is potentially going to focus on the Klingon war (assuming Mr. Abrams isn't too busy with Star Wars).

Like its predecessor, Into Darkness is largely focused on Kirk and Spock.  With another film comes more chemistry building, meaning if these films continue on with their current flow, it's very possible this duo could become legends in their own right.  However, the advantages of making a television show instead of a feature film is the ability to give the supporting cast more time to shine.  The original series gave each of the supporting members the chance to further the depth of their characters, while the cast of the new films are basically reduced to offering their own set of one-liners - most of which are used for comedy.  This was also the case if you look back on the Next Generation films, which focused largely on Captain Picard, and Data, while the rest of the crew was basically along for the ride.  Of course, they already had 7 seasons of television under their belts, so it was a huge deal - but this is where the future of the Star Trek franchise comes into question.  Without character development, it will be difficult to sustain momentum past the next sequel.

To this point, Star Trek: Into Darkness is the best summer blockbuster of 2013.  This action-packed sequel pays homage to the original series, while still continuing to draw new fans to the franchise.  However, it's difficult to justify a claim that this sequel is superior to the first film, since they are nearly mirror images of one another.  Both focus on the same cast members, both feature similar villains, and both end in essentially the same exact way.  With each passing sequel comes more questions about where the next one will take us - but until then, feel free to beam aboard the Star Trek bandwagon and embrace the outer space chaos.

While the fans may have been impatient for Abrams to get the ball rolling on this sequel ever since the release of the 2009 franchise reboot, practical reasoning makes it obvious that waiting is always better if the product is successful. In this sequel, the same emotions, feelings, and thoughts from the first Star Trek are all explored again, but on a much deeper and more aggressive level. This also goes for everything else in the movie. Much like the first movie, the acting is superb, the action is crazy but terrific, and the unexpected plot points are of course, always welcome. Some have compared this film to 'Iron Man 3', 'Skyfall', and 'The Dark Knight Rises' in its execution. They say that they are all too similar in plot, because they all feature a central male character that is known to regret his feelings and actions from the past. They all feature an enigmatic villain that defeats and/or humiliates the character on their own turf. The main character then has to make a decision whether or not to step outside their comfort zone, all at potential great cost to everyone else. While I agree that these similarities are true and very interesting, they do not discredit any of the mentioned films. Each of these films is fashioned in a different way, and gives the viewer an entirely different feeling. So I, for one, no matter what any detractors of this film may say, highly recommend this film to any Star Trek or sci-fi fan, or any movie fan in general. It is absolutely amazing.",1368748800,15,1611,4.696113074204947

Star Trek 14: As of April 2018, Paramount has chosen female director S. J. Clarkson for the first time. In a time travel story, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) will meet his father, George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth). No production date nor release date yet.

5295004,5,B009934S5M,Incredible movie. Does not disappoint! Thrilling and wonderful addition to the Star Trek universe and perfect followup for 2009's Star Trek. It will please fans and non-fans alike!,1368662400,7,180,5.464285714285714

Based on the sloppy, cartoonish writing of 2009's Star Trek, I was ready and set to hate its sequel. Writers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have a reputation for lazy, nonsensical writing (see any of the Transformers films, especially 2 and 3) that I feared would permeate my favorite fictional universe, further watering down the intellectual themes that make Star Trek such a captivating series. However, this time out the writers turned out a strong script which, though not without some problems, is the foundation for J.J. Abrams' beautiful, highly entertaining and resonant film.

Like its predecessor, Star Trek Into Darkness follows the adventures of Captain Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban). Scotty (Simon Pegg), Checkov (Anton Yelchin) and Sulu (John Cho) are also along for the ride, along with new science officer Carol Marcus (Alice Eve).

The actors have all grown into their roles, with Quinto and Pegg being the standouts this time. Quinto's Spock is reminiscent of Leonard Nimoy's performance without being a copy, and Pegg channels James Doohan to the character's credit. I did not buy these actors in their roles last time, but this film nicely remedies that problem. Alice Eve's Marcus isn't given much to do, but she's fine in the role she plays.

The solid performances are given amidst solid writing. Even though this film is more action-packed than the last one, it slows down to explore and develop the characters with greater care than was taken last time. Here, the writers dispense the comic-book origin story formula in favor of creating characters that grow into the complex, adult versions of themselves that longtime fans are familiar with.

Following a mission gone wrong in which Kirk has to choose whether to follow Starfleet's cardinal rule of noninterference at the expense of his best friend's life, Kirk loses command of the Enterprise, leaving him to grapple with his rashness and rule breaking. Words exchanged between Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and Kirk about Kirk not being ready for command tell the audience that the writers and director are engaging with their rather absurd decision to promote Kirk entirely out of the lower ranks before he learned the necessary lessons that those positions teach.

Meanwhile, Spock continues to struggle with balancing logic against emotion and knowing when to use which as a tool and weapon. His relationship with Uhura is on track, gets tested a little, but it seems bigger developments might be saved for the next film.

A terrorist attack against Starfleet--a chilling, quiet moment in an otherwise loud film full of music in almost every scene--reunites the crew under Kirk's command and sends them in pursuit of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch). As other reviewers have said, when Cumberbatch speaks, you listen. His Harrison is a clever villain with thoughtful motivations, making him stand out against Eric Bana's boisterous, sort-of-silly Nero. Cumberbatch's gravitas convinces Kirk--and the audience--that dark things are happening in Starfleet.

Starfleet's darker elements stand out and resonate. Fearing another catastrophe following the destruction of Vulcan and near destruction of Earth in the prior film, portions of Starfleet have militarized. New weapons are developed, prompting Scotty to ask whether Starfleet is still an organization of explorers like it's meant to be. The writers cleverly pull together a number of elements from all five Star Trek series to develop the organization and create an atmosphere highly relevant to present day America. As we watch the flagship of a democracy modeled on the United States embark on a journey to kill one of its citizens with the equivalent of a drone strike, we contend with the morality of our own real-world policies. The parallel is a little too obvious at times, but is developed in a thoughtful way that does not overwhelm.

Still, the movie is not perfect. Perhaps in preparation to helm Star Wars, Abrams treats warp-drive like hyperspace, ignoring distances between planets in favor of advancing to the next action scene. Starfleet is portrayed as an insular organization, having no contact with the civilian government. I would have liked to see the Federation president's take on the increased militarization and drone strikes. Also absent is any civilian reaction to Starfleet's failure to save Vulcan, the terrorist attack it suffers, or its increased military production. However, these absent elements do lay a good foundation for a new TV series, should CBS decide to take that route.

 The worst moment in the film comes close the beginning, when we see a Starfleet officer agree to carry out the terrorist attack at Harrison's behest in exchange for Harrison's genetic sequence, which can save the life of the officer's ill daughter. This moment is meant to humanize and connect the audience to the terrorist, but the choice to use a dark-skinned London man who appears to be of Indian or Pakistani descent is obvious and at least mildly offensive. I can think of no reason the terrorist isn't a white man other than to more easily make the audience think of the dark-skinned man as some sort of ""other,"" especially as Americans typically associate terrorists with dark-skinned Muslim men.

Despite some missteps and missed opportunities, Star Trek Into Darkness is a great film. It has a strong story, develops three-dimensional and believable characters, and creates a beautiful futuristic, lived-in world. J.J. Abrams creates the right mix of character moments and action, and even the lens flares don't seem as distracting. ILM's special effects team outdoes itself. There are several breathtaking shots, one very close the beginning of the film (no, not the volcano, though that one is gorgeous too). I'm not a fan of 3D, but it really stands out here.

The bottom line: Star Trek Into Darkness is a smart, breathtaking thrill ride for the casual movie-goer and longtime fan alike, making it 10 warp jumps ahead of its predecessor.",1368662400,14,6106,5.18052738336714
5295006,5,B009934S5M,"So that you know where I come from: I have followed this series/franchise since it originally aired in '65-66 with ""The Cage"" until now. The new cast and movies remain true to Roddenberry's original vision of a future where humanity explores new worlds and cultures; and explores the inner man's (or woman's) potential for darkness or light with right or wrong choices and the consequences involved. Sci-Fi is all about the ""what if""; the best sci-fi challenges our smug paradigms and opens our vision to consider different viewpoints. HOW that vision has been re-birthed in these movies has been fresh and entertaining. Sit back and enjoy the ride.

The new cast is excellent in creating both the sentimental and the fresh characters with the exception of one wish on the part of this old Trekker vet: a Spock who has the deep voice and mature complexity of Leonard Nimoy. It added to the gravitas of the character. Quinto's performance is still somewhat tentative in the quieter dialogue and I hope he is able to overcome that. Nimoy brought an assured ""intellectual cowboy"" to the role: brains and adventurous daring. Quinto needs to employ more of that gravitas.

Karl Urban's Dr. McCoy is outstanding: he has all the irascibility and sense of adventure of the original character. He ""boldly goes"" and yet complains about the damned inconvenience of the journey at the same time. Simon Pegg's character development shows a great deal of potential and brings the right amount of comic relief in the heavy scenes.

Zoe Saldana is a bit more salty than her predecessor, Nichelle Nichols, but that reflects the change in our own culture's role of women. Both played Lt. Uhuru very well and Nichols' character developed with our own cultural changes.

Chris Pine? He embodies the early Capt. Kirk character perfectly. Bright, contumacious, adventurous and reckless with some well-earned experiential caution. Moments in which he looked at those who were obviously ""extreme"" displayed the moral center of the character. Prime Directive? Ditch it when convenient.

It's an entertaining ride into a favorite Sci-Fi franchise. Let's hope it continues: ""make it so.""",1368662400,8,2160,5.090395480225989
5295007,3,B009934S5M,"Why not create an original story?  This film felt more like a fanboy's dream.  It was bursting with nostalgic relics from the old shows & films, but didn't contain much substance.  Peter Weller's role somewhat stole the spotlight from Benedict Cumberbatch, not in the sense that his performance was any better, but his side-story & motives detracted from the film's true villain:  Khan.

Spock's Khan yell was a terrible decision for the filmmakers, and Kirk basically dying in the same manner as Spock (in The Wrath of Khan), ruined the film.  The dialogue during that scene was also very similar to the original film.

Overall, the film was decent, not necessarily better than it's predecessor, but the blatant ripoff references from The Wrath of Khan destroyed any true appreciation for this new direction for this ""alternate"" timeline.",1368403200,14,839,5.08029197080292
