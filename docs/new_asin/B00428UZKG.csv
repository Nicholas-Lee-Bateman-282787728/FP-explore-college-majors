8627888,5,B00428UZKG,"I Bought this DVD because I was looking for a ""Farm Animals"" DVD but in Spanish, which is not easy to find. My son loves farm animals and he really liked the DVD. It kept him entertained for a long time and he asked me to repeat it over and over again. Of course I do not let him see television for more than 2 hours per day, it is an educational video, I love the fact it has the letters of the animals' names spelled out on the screen so I can work with my son teaching him the letters, we watched the DVD together. I also like the fact it is not just animals or just puppets or just kids, it is a little of everything which keeps my son very happy. I Totally recommend it.",1284595200,,675,3.898550724637681
