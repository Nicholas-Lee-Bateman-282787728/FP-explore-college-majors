8506376,5,B006Y3QADS,"We took our LO on a trip to Japan last May when he was 9 months old and he used to watch this show at the hotel while we were getting ready to start the day and will just be amazed by it, so before coming back we bought this DVD for him to take home. He is now 14 months old and just LOVES to watch the DVD. It is important to say that there are not subtitles or translations, everything is in japanese which we don't speak but the characters and songs are so cute that just watching them sing and dance is a blast speacially for our LO who now dances along with them. Songs are about seasons, food, shoes, animals, brushing teeth, going to sleep and ordinary things like that so it is easy to explain what is going on to LO and even though he will not learn japanese from watching and listening to this we consider it is interesting for him to be exposed to different languages and to learn that people in other countries speak differently.",1348704000,2,941,4.147540983606557
