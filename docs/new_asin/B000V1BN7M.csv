Students keep borrowing it and forgetting to return it.",1233446400,,395,4.75
2928193,5,B000V1BN7M,I'm as teacher and have used this video in class many times. The Disney character draws and holds the children's attention. I feel this is planting the seeds of many concepts that will make learning these concepts later a bit easier.,1228608000,,233,4.7073170731707314

I usually try to use it at the beginning of the school year after we do a brief study of mathematicians who made major contributions to mathematics.  This video captured the attention of my students in 6th, 7th and 9th grade and does a great job at sparking interest in those who feel that math MUST be boring.  I spent months hunting down a video cassette of this cartoon and am SO excited to see that it has FINALLY come out on dvd.  This is a must have for math teachers!!",1215475200,11,600,4.283185840707965

I teach first-year university students mathematics. We discuss the nature of mathematics - arbitary consistent statements and logical conclusions. This gives a welcome break to the heavy thinking based upon rational thought, and helps with students' motivation.

2928222,5,B000V1BN7M,"First, let me trot out my creds. I took a PhD in combinatorial mathematics from Ohio State in 1986. I'm going to claim this is relevant for two reasons: one, that this cartoon is based upon some deep and beautiful mathematics; that this material can open up into deeper study for any student, from junior high to postgraduate.

The second is that this can open up mathematics for kids, and I will offer myself as an example. I remember seeing this when I was pretty young, and really got hooked on the bit about learning to play pool ""by the Diamond method"". It offered that math was ""a lot more than just two times two"", and that it was cool to study math.

The cartoon focuses deeply on non-arithmetic aspects of math, and that is welcome. Even as an adult, I still find it entertaining, but would be something I would give to any kid I cared about to expose him to the art behind math.

Buy it for the kids, or for yourself. But be prepared to study number theory and algebraic geometry, if you follow the leads -- rich material awaits... and as the cartoon notes, there are still many other doors to open and new things to discover...",1472947200,,1138,4.38388625592417

I have read books on the ""diamond"" system over the years and found them to be rather confusing but last night I realized that what I saw back in the late 50's was my answer to my billiard mystery.

2928260,5,B000V1BN7M,"I have watched ""Donald in Mathemagic Land"" more times than I care to admit. It is a wonderful DVD, and even has curriculum information that can be used by teachers to prepare lessons for the classroom.

However, I question why, if Ludolph van Ceulen, an early modern mathematicians correctly calculated pi to an accuracy of 35 digits in the 18th century, and Jurij Vega reached an accuracy of 126 digits in the 19th century, that Disney would make two mistakes about the value of pi in this program. (In the glossary, they say that pi is equal to 22/7 or approximately 3.14; while in the program itself, a talking geometric figure makes a mistake, saying that pi is equal to 3.141592653589747 etc. Change 9747 to 9793 and it agrees, as far as it goes, with the 18th century value calculated by hand.

Source for 18th and 19th century details:
https :// en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Approximations_of_%CF%80
(last symbol is ""pi"" symbol, if it doesn't show up here correctly)

But, this error is NOT enough to penalize them by removing any stars.

I understand the ""Golden Ratio"" and the ""Golden Rectangle"" much better based on this film, even if they say that the golden ratio is approximately 8 by 5 or eight fifths. Technically true, for the high school students that would also watch this, it would be helpful if they had given a more specific, if still irrational, value. Of course, students can easily double check the value on the Internet.

Perhaps ""Disney"" included these mistakes so that the older students could do the work themselves to find the correct values.

Can you learn from this animated movie?

I'm 64. I got 800 for my math score on the SAT in 1968, and got 800 for quantitative scores on my GRE in 1976 and 1996. (My 1996 GRE scores qualified me for the Triple Nine Society.) In spite of my great math scores, I still learn from Donald in this film, which I vaguely recall, might have been the main feature on the first ever color broadcast of Walt Disney's television show.

If I can learn more about math when I watch this, then so can you. I highly recommend this DVD to you.

John, former teacher, M.S. Education

P.S. How do you create a golden rectangle? (see diagram)

1. Draw a square (see red lines in diagram)

2. Mark a point exactly in the middle of one side of the square.

3. Set your compass to make a circle with a radius that is equal to the distance from that halfway point to one of the opposite corners. Draw an arc from that point that extends to the line that extends from the midpoint that you marked in step 2.

4. Make a rectangle that uses the point where the circular arc intersects that extended line.

These steps may look complicated, but the film makes it look easy. It also shows us many places in ancient and modern times where we can see golden rectangles and golden ratios.",1444780800,,2826,4.524557956777996

I used it in the classroom, but it's so entertaining, an adult might enjoy the creative, fun approach to making math interesting.  I like when Donald talks about square roots, as he walks past trees with above ground roots, square ones, holding the tree above the ground.  Math gets a bad rap, it doesn't have to be hard or boring, and this is a fun way to create some curiosity and goodwill towards math.  ;-)",1434931200,6,461,4.3882352941176475

2928292,5,B000V1BN7M,"When Disney tried again with hour-long classic shorts DVDs in 2009, Donald in Mathmagicland became a standalone disc during that time, which was merely a reissue of the 2007 Disney Movie Club version, even including an old intro for the Wonderful World of Disney, but still a beloved short hit! Through the unseen Spirit of Adventure (Professor Ludwig von Drake himself, Paul Frees), Donald Duck ends up in Mathmagicland and learns all sorts of things about how math isn't just for equations or school or work, or for ""(gosh-derned) eggheads"" as he put it, and there's a HECKUVA WHOLE LOT MORE to it than 2 & 2; ""it's everywhere, EVERYWHERE!"" to quote SpongeBob. Donald in Mathmagicland's a real treat to have at school, or even at home among hour-long classic Disneytoon shorts DVDs, no matter how old you are! Alongside Disney's American Legends or the 2009 Animation Collection or Have A Laugh, this is another exception to all classic Disneytoon shorts DVDs being in the Disney Vault; all of these releases, including this one, are still being made and sold brand-new on DVD! If you like DVD subtitle tracks, they can be accessible on your DVD/Blu-ray remote's subtitles button, but not on the menu. The feature program is the restored Treasures print, seeing as how the opening is noticeably windowboxed, even on a classic 4x3 TV. This short received an Oscar nomination, not in animated shorts, but in short documentaries, which makes it all the more revered for Disney fans both young and old, including myself.

I think this movie does a good job bringing mathematical thought to a child's attention, and highlighting how much more there is to math than simply solving rows of equations on a piece of paper at one's desk.

My kids are six and ten. They both enjoyed watching Donald in Mathmagic Land though I think the older one got a little more educational value out of it.

I thought Disney did a great job of illustrating (animating) how math is applicable to life in so many ways, plus some of the historical development of mathematics.

I finally bought the DVD and watched it with my 3 girls, 7, 11, and 15 years old. They all loved it too and it was as good as I remembered. They are all good at math but like so many kids (and adults) they just can't see how much of the higher mathematics could possibly mean anything to them. This really helped them see how life = math, in just 25 minutes. It doesn't go super in-depth or anything, it's just a fun way to get kids and grownups to go ""ooooh neat!"" about math, and it does the trick even after 50 years.

Definitely worth it.",1371081600,,869,4.228915662650603

I first saw this as a kid on the Disney ""Wonderful World of Color"" TV show and loved it [ this was in the same timeframe as their famous Man in Space trilogy]. Walt Disney was very interested in the popularization of science. And this was before the Space Race really took off. Donald Duck makes the perfect ""explorer"" character for the story. It makes the basics of math and the history of how mathematics developed very understandable and fun to learn. The graphics are fabulous as is the stories pacing. My daughter grew up with an old VHS copy of this and immediately asked for a DVD when I told her that I had ordered one from Amazon. She is a graduate artist and she also loves the art in this show. My granddaughter and grandson [both teenagers] also like this a lot and both learned stuff about math that they didn't lean in school.

The page went through, and my old address popped up, and there is no longer delivery to that address. Period. I corrected it immediately, and the next business day I got a message that the movie had already been sent to the old address (it was corrected within seconds!). Then I got a message that the movie had been sent back to the store because it did not meet quality control and I would get the refund in up to 7 days! This is one of about 7 recent problems I have had with Amazon...I live in McLennan County, with friends and family in West. Lots going on in my life, and when I realized that the old address was coming up incorrectly, and went to the old post office to tell them, it was too late for some of the material.

2928444,5,B000V1BN7M,"I bought this item for use by my wife, who is a mathematician teaching Geometry to advanced middle school students.  This product brings back fond memories of the actual times we would have watched this in our own formative years, on the Walt Disney TV shows each Sunday night.  It also conveniently packages this classic film presentation, along with a license for use, to present this material in a format suitable for a typical classroom setting.  This DVD does an excellent job of illustrating in an entertaining and educational form the timeless beauty and history of mathematics in a multitude of ways.  It helps to stimulate a young person's interest in geometry and its relationship to nature, art, music, and game strategies (the billiards scene).

We bought it so that my wife's teaching could utilize this as a multimedia component of her lesson plans in Geometry and mathematical topics such as the Golden Ratio.  It could equally be of use to the music teacher or the history teacher wishing to tie various lessons together with other faculty, or to the home school as a resource.

This product is well worth the purchase price.  The magic of Walt Disney studios in its prime, coupled with the timeless nature of mathematics, make for an excellent product that is of benefit to our family and to education.",1303084800,,1319,4.857142857142857

I was sold.
Although the character of Mr. McDuck had long left the Disney Channel Universe by that time...they still understood the concept of good vs. sort of bad. They picked up the idea that with a little study even they could defeat the financial establishment and triumph...and to be very, very careful what you sign.
Not bad for a simple story.
When my daughters were young, I purchased the VHS version of the book. They enjoyed and benefited from it...hence the need to buy the DVD version ofr my oldest who wanted it to use in her classroom.

I first saw this when I was still in Elementary School, and I didn't care too much about the subject (I did, however, found Donald Duck amusing). Now, I see it as a Disney classic, something that can entice just about everybody. Mathematics is still an unpopular subject in cartoons today, but Disney has made it interesting with Donald Duck and some vivid 50's animation. When you think of Donald Duck, you think of a talking duck with a tempestuous temper. But here, he's more relaxed (but still hilarious) and follows along with the history of mathematics and its uses. Paul Frees of Ludwig von Drake fame is the narrator, and he gives some pretty helpful info on how the human mind (and the entire world) is depended on numbers, shapes, and sizes. This one is truly special, folks. Nice music and animation, amusing ways to admire mathematics, and of course, Donald Duck. Donald in Mathmagic land is one huge treat.

NOTE: Some people might be disappointed with this newly released DVD because it has no special features whatsoever. I, for one, don't mind it, but an audio commentary would have been nice.

Donald Duck might seem like an odd choice to teach mathematical concepts, but he's actually the ""student"", while the narrator is the teacher. Donald is led through appearances of math in everyday life, such as making billiard shots and making music. The cartoon is fast paced and funny, and thus engaging while getting across serious points.

The trick, in my opinion is getting students to understand how old the movie is and appreciate some of the quirks due to its age.

2928472,5,B000V1BN7M,"One of the last four theatrical Donald Duck cartoons, Donald in Mathmagic Land didn't get the Academy Award for 1959, which went to John Hubley's Moonbird, but it was nominated for ""Best Documentary Short"". In retrospect, it's probably not only the best educational short of that year, but one of the best of any year. Hamilton Luske directed this lavish featurette, which despite clocking in at only 27 minutes, is filled with modernistic late '50s style art, dense and lavish color, and our favorite, irascible duck.

Teachers loved to project this film for their classes, as it was so far above the host of now decently buried educational films of the time. This DVD opens with a montage trailer of scenes from the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" releases, which have the characteristic look of the four color Technicolor of the '60s, and that places this film in its rightful millieu. In his biography, former NBC head, Pat Weaver recalls that Disney offered NBC its film and TV catalog in the mid- '50s if NBC would buy a fourth of the then fledgling Disneyland Park. David Sarnoff, president of RCA, which owned NBC, flatly refused. The Disneyland TV show therefore continued on ABC, with a title change in the 1959 season to ""Walt Disney Presents"". Due to the runaway success of Davey Crockett, however, ABC wanted Walt to keep cranking out westerns, so in 1961, the program moved to NBC, with a new name many viewers remember, ""The Wonderful World of Color"".

""General"" Sarnoff had made clear that RCA's one goal was to sell color TV sets, since most homes still had black and white, and ""Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land"" aired on its new network as part of an hour show hosted by a new character, Ludwig Von Drake, called ""An Adventure in Color"". I very much wish that had been included on this DVD, as not only is the program interesting in its own right, as well as a favorite of Von Drake fans, but it's a fascinating snapshot of the early days of color TV, as the mallard professor talks about color, with continual asides like ""you people with black and white sets will have to imagine what this looks like"". Then there's the theme song, ""The world is a carousel of color, color, color. Wonderful, wonderful color."" The accompanying slow motion nature shots made for an unforgettable, captivating entrance to the show, which segued to the magic paintbrush, the famous trademark of Disney educational films. Even in the days of black and white sets, Disney had farsightedly chosen to film in color.

An early VHS release for video stores included the entire show, but so far, the other part hasn't made it to DVD. This shorter featurette, however, stands alone, and has far outlived most of the other animated shorts from the show. It's also on The Chronological Donald Volume Four. Some reviewers have noted that ten bucks might be a bit high for an under half hour show, and it would be nice to have some extras like interviews with animators or commentary on the short. However, anyone who's ever seen this film will probably just be happy to find it on DVD. There's also an ""enhanced"" teacher's edition for about $50. That may seem steep, but you get a ""printable teachers' guide"" and public performance license to show it in class, not unlike when educators of an earlier era would rush to rent the film reel from distributors, and it probably ranked as the most checked out educational film.

The math in this film has been criticized, and some of it seems a bit of a stretch, but anyone interested in the Golden Section or Divine Proportion, as it is variously termed, or patterns in nature, or basic principles of how a guitar works likely first got the bug watching this show. Someone might even have hit the billiard hall armed with tricky shots from the film. Some of the chessboard and geometric shapes parts might seem more like an excuse to make some animation, but they are still entertaining, and this is not the only wildly speculative Disney film. If a few bits seem somewhat dated, that's all part of the fun of a period film, and for animation lovers, this one is a treasure trove. So in many ways, this bare-bones, budget edition is the best of all worlds, and will likely entice new viewers to join old fans on the well-trod path with Donald in Mathmagic Land.",1250726400,53,4289,4.67682119205298
