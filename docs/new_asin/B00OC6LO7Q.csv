6735417,5,B00OC6LO7Q,"""Stingray"" is now available in a new boxed DVD set that gives you the entire series in one slim package of 5 one-sided discs.  And it's a fantastic warm-up to the 1966 ""Thunderbirds"" show which many regard as the apex of Gerry Anderson's Supermarionation accomplishments.  The video transfers of ""Stingray"" are clear enough, though they have not undergone the kind of image restoration or audio enhancements as the ""Thunderbirds"" series released by A&E. The ""Stingray"" episodes are presented on DVD in their uncropped original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, with original mono audio.  Here we have the beautiful puppetry and swanky futuristic miniature sets, the model work of Derek Meddings, Barry Gray's very familiar music themes and cues (which in this series are beginning to sound very much like ""Thunderbirds"" cues).  Much of the action takes place underwater, of course, so we have some marvelous blue-green color schemes and lighting effects.  All in all, this is a lot of fun classic television, for a reasonable price.  Recommended.",1422748800,19,1033,5.2303030303030305

6735419,5,B00OC6LO7Q,"For me, the real ""star"" of the show was the 600 knot (!) submarine Stingray.  But, I never understood what the ""3"" on that fin meant.  All 39 episodes are here.  There is suppose to be a short Gerry Anderson interview, but it is not listed in the TOC and I have yet to find it.

The video and audio quality is what to expect from a DVD for 1960's material.  This material has not been re-mastered.  It is the same video and audio quality that we got from a previous release.  Basically, it is just a repackaging of the previous version.

This company is supposed to be releasing ""Supercar"" and ""Fireball XL-5"".  When, I am not sure.  Doesn't matter.  I already own those and since there is no appreciable difference in the quality, I'll be saving my money.",1421884800,20,756,4.366906474820144

6735421,4,B00OC6LO7Q,"I own the Gerry Anderson series Fireball XLV, Thunderbirds, and now Stingray.  Of the three, Stingray is the weakest.  There is much more forced humor in this series than the other two and the final disc's episodes have more of the aura of a mid-1960s version of MTV music video than a science fiction/fantasy show.  That's not by any means an indictment of the producers as underwater versions of the genre tend to be limited in concept.  And all that being said, by all means if you're a fan of our beloved marionettes then you certainly must add Stingray to your collection!",1477008000,,577,4.627450980392157

6735430,5,B00OC6LO7Q,"Despite its intended UK home market having no colour TV in 1964, Gerry Anderson looked to the future and to selling the series to the American networks, and made Stingray in color. It was a good decision. All 39 episodes of this classic sci-fi series about Troy Tempest (character based on the actor James Garner), his sidekick Phones Sheridan and the silent aquatic Marina in their atomic sub Stingray, protecting the human race from malevolent undersea races are presented here on a five-DVD package in their original running order.

Besides the technicolor, other innovations for this series included interchangeable heads for the marionettes enabling differing facial expressions (sometimes just for a few seconds in a scene) and two strong female characters  though Marina doesnt speak as she comes from an undersea race of mute telepaths! In keeping with most of the action taking place under the sea, the series deploys some impressive blue/green lighting effects and an often atmospheric soundtrack.

Even though no restoration has been done on the original episodes, they still look more than OK. For a TV series aimed at kids in 1964, the storylines are generally strong with bursts of plentiful action as the crew of Stingray encounter sentient undersea races both friendly and hostile, but they often have a light touch too. The characters are surprisingly well realised, from the chronically cantankerous Commander Shore to the conniving secret agent X20 who sounds like the actor Peter Lorre, and the series villain Titan whose character seems to be based on Mussolini but speaks like Sir Laurence Olivier.

The atomic submarine Stingray is, however, the star of the show. The Andersons sure had a flair for designing futuristic looking machines for their TV series and the sleek, fish-shaped blue & yellow sub is one of the most enduring and memorable.",1462492800,5,1867,5.151815181518152
6735431,4,B00OC6LO7Q,"The 1964 TV show in supermarionation returns in this five single sided DVD set. The picture quality is wonderful. The series however,for me,doesn't hold up as well as its predecessor Fireball XL5, and definitely not the show to follow,The Thunderbirds;the Anderson's penultimate triumph. To me it seems this show should have followed Fireball,instead of the other way around.
The voice acting is excellent with the undersea King Titan sounding a little like Sir Laurence Olivier and his agent above the sea X20 sounding and looking like Peter Lorre. As usual musical director Barry Gray knocks it out of the park. This is the only Anderson series though I had a beef about,musically. The ending tune/vid is out of sync with the show itself. In the show its star Troy Tempest has a girl friend Atlanta. Marina is a mute from under the sea who comes to live and work with Tempest and the gang. Their relationship is purely business/platonic. However the ending  makes it seem like Troy secretly longs for Marina, when there was no such dynamic in the show at all. Although a good song, it is strangely out of place and puzzled me back in its debut in /64 and still does today.
All in all though,to me,not as good as Fireball XL5 or Thunderbirds to come,it still shows a lot of merit and you can see the craftsmanship of the crew getting stronger and stronger as the show progresses. And if you are a compleatist, then you must have this series for your collection.",1459900800,,1462,4.688715953307393

6735434,5,B00OC6LO7Q,"I loved the show when I watched it as a kid, and loved watching all the episodes in this collection again 50 years later.  A pleasant surprise was that, as an adult, it held my interest through every single episode.  I thought I might lose interest as it is a kids' show, but I did not.  The stories and scripts were very entertaining, and, I just love marionettes.",1455062400,6,365,4.338235294117647

6735436,5,B00OC6LO7Q,"Talk about time travel! This really takes me back to when I was a small child watching these. Excellent Gerry Anderson series. Sure it's a little simplistic, etc - because it's aimed primarily at children, but it's still good entertainment as well as bringing back memories. Some of the characters such as the strange fish god and the non talking girl I had forgotten about.. true imagination running riot in this show, but let go of conformity and age, just kick back and go with the flow...",1449187200,5,492,4.666666666666667
6735437,5,B00OC6LO7Q,Huge fan of Gerry Anderson - I watched this as a kid and still love it. One thing that Supermarianation has that CGI doesn't have - This technique looks and feels like you are the child playing - you can see the strings and that's OK because it just reminds us it is all make believe,1445731200,2,283,4.071428571428571

6735444,4,B00OC6LO7Q,"""Singray""(1964-65) is a Gerry/Sylvia Anderson creation (The Thunderbirds, Space 1999). The theme of the episodes takes place in the sea and focuses on the crew of the underwater combat submarine ""Stingray"". This was the first of Anderson's puppet shows to be filmed in colour and to have characters with interchangeable heads that featured a variety of expressions. During the episodes the crew meet a variety of under water civilizations, some friendly, some not. One of the main characters, Marina, is from one of these underwater civilizations that joins the crew of Stingray on their various underwater adventures. The shows 39 episodes are all here and if they have not been remastered they do look excellent.",1434240000,11,714,5.217391304347826
