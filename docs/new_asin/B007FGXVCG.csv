5082421,5,B007FGXVCG,Thanks for keeping the oldies available. Great video and so nice to look back at the wonderful great singers from the past. I really enjoyed this video and I will continue to seek out the famous performers from the past. I think you will enjoy this video as I did. Nothing better than old great memories. Thank You Amazon and the Seller.,1357948800,,337,4.451612903225806
5082422,5,B007FGXVCG,"This set of DVD's is a great collection from the many country singers available.  It has an easy to follow menu, although it's not just click 'play' and sit back, and does require starting each singer individually with a segment of several songs. Although that may be a small negative, it doesn't take anything away from the overall great production of such a wide range of talent.  Definitely value for money.",1351814400,32,410,4.76056338028169
5082423,5,B007FGXVCG,"Country Legends DVD with 50 mini concerts is a treasure to own if you have been a country music fan for several decades. The live performances are true to the original recordings, and there are performers on here (eg. Gene Watson) whom I had actually never seen before. Earl Thomas Conley impressed me with his baritone on songs like ""Angel in Disguise"" and I think you'll discover a lot of memories from artists like Tammy Wynette, Lee Greenwood, George Jones and other country music icons. In sum, a very enjoyable DVD for country music fans.",1342483200,28,544,4.7368421052631575
5082424,5,B007FGXVCG,"This collection turned out to be exactly what I was hoping in the back of mind that it would be, but thought that in all probability I would be disappointed.
What it actually is is a collection of fifty performaces, or more accurately, just as the title suggests, fifty mini-concerts, of three or four or five performances each, at the Church Street Station, and in color!
It is rare to find performances of older country acts on film, and most especially in color, but here you have fifty of them!
This is a mind-boggling bargain, and one I took a gamble on, hoping that it would turn out as good as it has proven, incredibly, to be.
I feel like Christmas came early, and I have been rewarded with a terrific Christmas present.",1339113600,71,728,4.481203007518797
5082425,4,B007FGXVCG,"Wow,this is a pretty cool DVD set of country music. I'm still on the 1st disc and am happy with this purchase. I got this for under $12 and I didn't realize it has FOUR DVD's!!!!! The audio is in mono but still sounds good! What is strange is each song is cut right before the ending. I think this is done so people don't ""steal""the audio for complete versions on CD? After getting use to the ""quick""ending on these performances,I'm still happy I got this set. At $3 a disc,who could complain? Lot's of great country stars,most of whom have passed on to ""Country Heaven"".This is a good way to get a glimps into many,many country stars in their prime. It's in color and the music is well mixed. Put on your boots and give it a spin!",1490572800,3,731,4.266187050359712

5082490,5,B007FGXVCG,I bought this for the residents of a retirement community and they love the return to the days of honky-tonk and old-time country western singers.  I would not call the quality excellent since the videos are accurate representations of what we actually watched on our tiny televisions.

5082494,4,B007FGXVCG,"This is a good set, however, for someone that doesn't know how to operate a DVD player (not me) but the lady I bought them for, you have to hit play on each artist and their set.

5082499,3,B007FGXVCG,"50 mini-concerts is exactly what it is, which makes it kind of a pain.  There are several stars and each one has approximately 6 songs.  You have to pick the star and then the song, although you can choose 'play all' and it will go through all six songs, but then you have to go back to the main menu and pick a different star's 'concerts'.  The word 'concert' is loosely used here as it is really clips from concerts and thus is rather choppy between songs and some middle songs are clearly last songs at a concert as the star is saying thanks and goodbye.  OK I guess for the money but it's bothersome to have to keep going back to the main menu every 15 minutes or so and pick a new star.  NOT something you can put on for a technology-lacking person and walk away as it needs constant attention.  But it was relatively inexpensive.",1391040000,3,835,4.253164556962025

5082501,3,B007FGXVCG,"As they state on the disk, the picture and sound quality is not top rated.  In some cases the music is louder than the singer so with the poor quality it is hard to understand.  When you go into the music listing, remember to go all the way to play all on each list or else it will go back after playing each song. There was a complete break between each song (black screen) instead of making it a continues performance.  When they put performances in they are not in order which is no problem unless it shows them leaving then they are back to do another song. We were just disappointed with the whole thing. It is in a saloon so you have the smoke and noise from the audience and in some cases someone walks in front of the camera.",1388793600,2,733,4.147887323943662

5082506,1,B007FGXVCG,Not what I thought I was getting.  I have seen infomercials of great western singers but THIS WAS NOT IT.  Too modern to be called  classic country.  A great disappointment.  Click and play each song--too difficult.,1380672000,3,215,4.861111111111111

5082512,5,B007FGXVCG,"50 performers, a couple hundred songs, various styles, some legends and some not quite, at a  VERY reasonable price.  You may never see some of these folks on video, so these are treasures. The recordings were made during performances at a night club/restaurant in Orlando, so what you are getting is clips from the sets of live performances where the audience could actually touch the performer ... and you can see the folks on stage energized because of it.  You don't see that on studio performances like Austin City Limits, as good as those can be.  These are only parts of a set, so no, you don't get ""all the hits"" ... but you do get some really good music that probably never got to radio.  Again, it's like discovering a coin in the sand at the beach, when all you were looking for is a shark's tooth. The quality of the video for a couple of the older shows is not so great, but the rest looks like broadcast quality for the 1980s.  You can see improvements in camera and director skills, too.  I won't say much about labels.  The 1980s really blurred the meaning of country/pop/folk/bluegrass/Cajun, etc.  Elements of all those are here and I think it's a real hoot that the NGDB actually performs a song about the confusion of trying to label THAT band.  Well worth the money ... and not so much just for ""country"" fans as for ANY fan of music and live performances !",1374796800,25,1378,4.4541832669322705
5082513,2,B007FGXVCG,The videos that I have watched aren't very good.  The videos all look like they were taken at some local night club type of environment.  Nothing at a first rate concert or club.  Most are tacky 70's or early 80's videos and the song for most of the artist aren't even their hits.,1373846400,2,280,4.245283018867925

5082524,5,B007FGXVCG,"This is one of your only chance to see all these artists perform. in a way it s priceless just for that. The price is incredebly low too.
That being said many people still complain about the picture. Yes true the quality is not top on all the performance but you can always reduce the size of the picture from your dvd player and the transformation will be great.

  All these shows that were filmed at Church street sattion in Orlando have that low quality picture, The rock and rol shows too have the same problem, but like I was sayiong it s often your only chance to get something live from these artists.

  Finally how lazy do people get the big issue is having to use your REMOTE. Wow you press play all at the artist of your choice and get usually betweene 3 to 6 songs. When he or she finishes your are brought back to the menu and re-do a new selection that is  THAT such a big effort. So to bring down the show on that issue is childish and irresponsible.",1359590400,11,966,4.1891891891891895
