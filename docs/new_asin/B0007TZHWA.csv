2244151,3,B0007TZHWA,"Antares is one of the brightest stars in the night sky, but everyone in this film flames out into darkness. As I watched the lives of three dysfunctional couples deconstruct, my mind wandered to the wisdom of the Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria: ""Be kind to all, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle."" All three couples are trapped in the same drab high rise apartments that serve as metaphors for their interior landscapes. The bored nurse Eva has an affair with an out of town doctor, but despite their torrid love affair she does not even remember the man's last name; nor do we ever learn her husband's name. The young and needy checkout clerk Sonja fakes a pregnancy to persuade her cheating boyfriend Marco to marry her. He's an immigrant laborer from Yugoslavia, injecting not only class-consciousness but ethnicity and immigration into the film. Despite her efforts to free herself, domestic violence traps Nicole with the jealous and abusive Alex, the third couple. In twists of fate that are more bizarre than important to the plot, the lives of these six people crash and collide, but only as ships passing in the night. Austrian angst buries everyone. In German with English subtitles.",1170028800,20,1216,4.907766990291262
2244152,4,B0007TZHWA,"A realistic 'slice of life' presentation, cinema verite style, which one needs to be in the mood for, about intersecting lives in a housing development. It was good to see an adult themed film complete with adult sexual content presented for adults. But note, the content is serious and depressing, as life can often be, and focused on connection or the absence of it..",1489795200,,369,4.78125
2244153,3,B0007TZHWA,"I was impressed that the movie had so many accolades going into it.  I found that it was well made, with good acting and production values.  I liked how the stories intertwined, though not in very meaningful ways. I think it was a snapshot of European culture during a very specific time, when there was a lot of hopelessness and frustration, and people just wanted to be free of whatever local tyranny they were under.  And, while that is a valid artistic statement, it doesn't make for a very enjoyable movie.  I would suggest watching this if you want to feel better about your life, because it is probably better than most of the people's in the film.",1486944000,3,655,4.52542372881356

2244155,3,B0007TZHWA,Odd movie but interesting watch. Using intertwining stories to show different events happening at same time and linking characters in a realistic way were well done. Nothing earth shaking but well done. Without the time gimmick the plot -- mundane and predictable -- could not have kept me watching. Explicit sex was not necessary but was in context with characters.,1486598400,,366,5.116666666666666

2244168,5,B0007TZHWA,"An unflinching look into the lives of three couples, set in a dreary housing project in Vienna, and how they overlap occasionally. It's sort of a Gemeindebau - Reigen. The language and interactions, as well as the sex scenes, are not prettified, what the viewer gets are dysfunctional relationships, people's lack of and need for intimacy, a general dullness that permeates the entire housing project and its inhabitants. The movie packs a punch and is strangely engrossing. It might not be for everybody.",1479081600,2,505,5.096385542168675

2244171,3,B0007TZHWA,"This is a movie made up of three main stories in which the characters are all loosely tied together in the end. The beginning showed some promise, but it got weaker the further along it went. It circles around three separate love affairs and the casualties surrounding the involved parties in each one; all of whom seem miserable in life and love. It made me want to be more kind to strangers, because one never really knows what they may be dealing with at home.",1476921600,,463,4.458823529411765

2244174,3,B0007TZHWA,Not quite what I expected. More like a woman's physiological analysis of her life. Looking for love in all the wrong places and a husband out of touch. It was okay. I could watch it again but I'd have to have time. It was rather slow moving.,1476057600,,241,4.148936170212766

2244194,4,B0007TZHWA,Like in reality there are small coincidences that we may take notice or not realize at all but this movie allows us that outside view.  Situations were left unresolved for the viewers imagination which I overall will say a good movie.,1466726400,,234,4.7073170731707314

Taking one couple and their situation, it bleeds off to another only mildly connected to the first story, and then to a third until you have a clear - if complex - portrait of three different couples. all bound together by sex - or a lack of it.

The camera work leaves a lot to be desired and if I was being very critical, I would say that the budget was on the low side for this film. In the end, the movie shows human relationships in a broad spectrum and is often the case reality far surpasses fiction.

We are all full of doo doo and - I have a reason to justify why, I am not like her, he is worse, I am better... The sex was tepid... it got better, the cheating got more meaningful, all of the characters were real - like a slice of the writer's life, a month of looking behind the curtain (seeing the truth - in moments of clarity I see the truth and get faint (must ignore truth immediately) and remind myself of the reason I am rich, I volunteer, I teach church, I know the president, I am better than the pope because at least I was justified when I took the steaks from church - to teach an important lesson. I threw them away...see, told you I sacrificed to teach them, a much needed lesson)
My experience of this movie, reminded me of me - if I could stand the pain of watching:
I saw myself NOT DOING all of these disgusting things!  There was an offensive excess of intention, squandered moments, delusion, fear, hiding from pain, facing a bit of reality, and - I was reminded, again, and again, nothing I try to do or fix affects my life... my description, in my head seems like my life,  and if I want I can believe you created the mess or life screwed me over... the result is exactly the same. It is what is...until it isn't...
  it took at least half of the movie to become interested in the drama of the lives I was spying on. Seems I am an invisible drone - like I am god and this movie is a recording of my minds eye on of lives I glanced at today for an hour or so as I was dozing on the couch...  typical...life...it is all good.
  Do or do not, there is no try, accept what is, do anything again... or don't... then accept what ever I do not do - or do, both are the result of ... I have not wasted any time, now is all there is, or ever was, nothing matters - unless it does, if it really matters? act, or accept I do not act, and watch more movies, and share my experience in a review, or accept I typed it and deleted it... spend time with the people I actually care about, that I don't want anything from... That was nobody...which meant I I had to spend years alone with myself before I really wanted to be with you, without wanting to get off on what I expected from you... good movie... or not... depends on who watches it.",1433635200,,2278,4.069196428571429
2244272,4,B0007TZHWA,"There is biased in the direction and production of this film towards liberation or escape despite the moral and economic price resulting from the acts of being unfaithful. The film succeeds in making the building in which of the human contact takes place the central character albeit lifeless. The metaphor of life moving on despite the actions of the players intertwined by a series of coincidences. The devices used and even the question of the destruction of family structure for personal friend dates the film. Society is non-static and human behavior ever evolving despite the saying 'there is nothing new under the sun'. Human sexual behavior has tempered given both physical and mental consequences in the past 20 years. However, in this structure of the 3 lives it is obvious changes are necessary despite the road ahead. In the end, this movie reflects the society of Eastern Europe eviscerating its economic, cultural and moral structure. In that sense, the ever present building with its adjacent park is like any country with rules and laws that remain as much as change swirls about; the option is anarchy and devolvement.",1433030400,,1135,5.042553191489362

Its about unusual but entirely believable relationships.

First, it is not American-style filmmaking, and it is unlikely something like this could be produced here.  The way in which the stores intertwine is quite fascinating; one has a good and just ending, the others leave it up to you to think about.  It confirms that you really don't want to know what your neighbors get up to.  It is sexy, foreign art house adult stuff; a very open mind is needed.  If this appeals to you, watch it.  If you prefer loads of gun violence, everyone is beautiful and lives in an amazing house along the Pacific Coast Highway, a horrible soundtrack of pop music, adolescent angst, and a happy ending, then go with Hollywood.",1412208000,10,794,4.465277777777778

The director times shifts repeatedly, showing the same event from different perspectives as the film progresses. There is a sense of foreboding throughout. Though quite explicit at times, that's not the real nature of this thoughtful film, which tries to say something about love and mature relationships, and how men and women relate or fail to relate. The theme is universal, though the characters are mostly German. One couple seems to be immigrants. The settings are bleak throughout, which add to the darkness.

Even though there is a close-up of someone's Wienerschnitzel in a hotel room, all of these scenes are secondary to the dramatic and well-crafted tales of men and women in modern day Vienna, struggling to come to terms with their sad, sordid and unfulfilling lives.

I would, however qualify my 5-Star Rating by noting that this movie is really for serious fans of foreign art films.  Others are likely to be bored.  This DVD is certainly quite lengthy, but manages to give good insights into the dark side of human nature.",1287360000,18,660,4.8053097345132745
2244299,4,B0007TZHWA,"What I could think of immediately after watching this movie is Austrian Crystal.  It breaks light into so many shiny sparks just like the seemingly unconnected lives of three couples living in dreary Vienna highrise.

I am a long time fan of the Film Movement movies, and it seems that as time goes by their production is getting bolder.  Multi-layered film reflects on lives of today's contemporary couples.  Married, living together, or separated by divorce, these couples face challanges of their personal lives, desires and inability to truly break away from their routines.  They each deal with their mysery by escape into a world of fantasy that is impermanent and just as fragile. How their lives are connected will require you to see this movie, but I promise you, you will not be disappointed.

I was suprised by bold choices women in this film make for themselves.  I was also stricken by a classical beauty of the actress playing Sonja, young grocery store clerk, needy and insecure, who wants to salvage her relationship with young eastern european immigrant Marko by any means possible, even by faking the pregnancy.

They have a few fetishes that creep into the mix. I liked this film. As the story unfolds, it becomes more grounded, and the viewer begins to see the lives of several people intertwine. These folks aren't entirely strangers, they have crossed paths daily in a subtle way. I love the way the director skillfully made all transitions into the knotted relationships that develop. We have the cheating wife, an overly jealous girlfriend driving her man to the bed of another, an insecure ex - boyfriend that abuses women. Somehow , three stories all smoothly come together. This is not a ""feel good"" film, but rather a reflection of the very real human condition. This stuff happens all around us. If you are easily depressed or identify with the repercussions of infidelity, it may not be for you. 4 stars for a well done production of a difficult subject.",1524441600,,1013,4.7942857142857145
