8630198,5,B001AMRBTA,"This DVD is an excellent in-depth tutorial for the technique of glazing that makes your watercolor and acrylic paintings glow with light and color.  Arleta Pech also uses this glazing technique with oils to create stunningly beautiful effects.  If I'm not mistaken, North Light will be publishing a book by Arleta Pech on transparent glazing in oils in 2009.  (Contact North Light Books to inquire about the publication date).

I do not paint in oil, but I will be purchasing that book, too (based on my experience with this DVD and other Arleta Pech DVDs that are only available through her website). Arleta is a rare combination of an artist who is as accomplished in the way she teaches as she is in her creation of fine art, so her books and videos go well beyond a specific ""how to"" demonstration of a particular painting.  As delightfully informal and unintimidating as her instruction and writing is, it's also organized in a very logical fashion.  Her goals are clearly defined and the content is structured with the purpose of meeting those goals. Somehow, she's able to work her left and right brain in just the right balance!

I've bought a lot of drawing and painting videos and DVDs over the years, but Arleta Pech's are the only ones that entice me to actually pick up a brush and paint after viewing.  I find that I turn to them again and again when I'm working on a project.  Just recently, I returned to her ""Silver and Brass in Watercolor"" DVD when I needed to paint a tuba.

The best part of this particular DVD for me is that it demonstrates the use of a very practical gadget that Arleta ingeniously invented to assist in deciding which color to apply in the glazing process WITHOUT APPLYING PAINT TO PAPER and possibly applying a glaze that gives an unintended result.  It's called a glazing viewer (you can find that on Arleta's website at [...].

I almost forget. If your medium is watercolor and you're like me, backgrounds can be very intimidating.  Arleta's DVD provides a fear-free lesson in painting a dark background.  A great thing about all her DVDs is that she provides a copy of her reference photo and a drawing for you to transfer to your paper or board, so you can get started learning the painting concepts immediately (no fiddling with drawing required).  The chapters on the video are:

Introduction and transfer of drawing
Color Composition
Painting the Background
Quilt Painting Steps
Flower Painting Steps
Blue Glass and Finishing Steps

If you're looking for a DVD that focuses specifically on oils, you can find that on Arleta's website ([...]), but if you work in watercolor or acrylics, this is an outstanding instructional video that is also fun to watch!",1231372800,2,2703,4.7414529914529915
