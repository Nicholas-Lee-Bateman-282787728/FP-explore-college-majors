8048495,5,B0007LSS2O,"This is a life changing workout! I've been using it for like 4 years and and can't imagine my life without it. That being said, It is NOT an easy workout. It is actually the last workout of a 3 part series. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing the first and second workouts in the series, 'Start it up' and 'Ramp it up.' It is NOT for novice exercisers but when used as a series, it is highly effective!",1445644800,2,396,4.1558441558441555
8048496,5,B0007LSS2O,"I purchased Burn It Up for my mom who absolutely love it. It's easy for her to follow along and she has lost 10 pounds after a month of exercising to Burn It Up and changing her eating habits,  Now she wants all of the products, so this will be easy gift buying for her.",1439769600,,270,3.909090909090909
8048497,5,B0007LSS2O,"This is an amazing series for begininers. I lost 14 lbs in the 6 weeks I did the program. I went down 2 pant sizes. It's wonderful I can not encourage people enough to but the product. I just had a baby 4 months ago and ordered it again because 5 lost my last one, to do again to get my baby weight off. Good luck :)",1411430400,,316,3.7313432835820897

8048500,5,B0007LSS2O,"I ORDERED THE PHASE 2 AND 3.  I DID THE PHASE 2 FOR ABOUT 7-10 WKS BEFORE STARTING THE 3RD.  LET ME JUST SAY THAT THIS DOES WORK.  YOU WILL TONE IN PLACE QUICKLY.  MY LEGS ARE GETTING MUSCLE TONE AS WELL AS MY ARMS.  THE 3RD VIDEO IS MORE INTENSE YOU NEVER GET A BREAK AND ITS VERY FAST PACE, BUT I DO IT AT MY OWN PACE.  I LOVE HER WORKOUTS YOU DO GET RESULTS.  I DO THESES 5 DAYS A WEEK AND SHOULD DO THEM 7.  GREAT WORKOUT",1253836800,2,425,3.5934065934065935
8048501,2,B0007LSS2O,"Received promptly, however, vhs was cracked where one reel is,still works but not worth the $23.00  paid and I thought I was getting more than 1 video. Not so happy about it!",1246665600,,174,4.4375
8048502,5,B0007LSS2O,"This workout is not easy but I tell you, Debbie works as hard as you do - This is the only workout DVD I have found that isn't a dance video but an exercise program - Three levels of intensity & time frames, 20 min, 45 min & 60 min. - She is genuine & beautiful - a big thumbs up!",1227657600,10,280,3.6065573770491803
8048503,4,B0007LSS2O,"This is the best workout I have ever done. I started using this tape to burn off some of this baby fat, my son left on me. It was hard at first because I hate excercise. She worked every area and the pounds just started falling off. I cut out my salt intake and increased my water intake and I could not believe the results. I would definately recommend this workout",1208908800,13,366,4.169014084507042
