851505,5,6304359659,"I loved this movie.  The pace went smoothly and quickly and I was enthralled in its story.  This movie was based on Charles Lindbergh's memoir, ""The Spirit of St. Louis,"" about his history making transatlantic flight from New York to Paris in May, 1927.  I read the book recently and some of the facts in the movie were changed for dramatic effect.  However, I thought that Stewart representation of the exhaustion that Lindberg felt during this 33-1/2 hour flight was excellent.  I thought that James Stewart was a lot of fun to watch and some of the excitement he showed, such as when he yells out of the plane to pedestrians when he is flying over Europe, reminded me of the enthusiasm he showed at the end of his classic movie, ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  I highly recommend this movie.",1495411200,4,788,4.5928571428571425

851791,5,6304359659,"I decided to get this film because I got curious about Lindbergh's translatlantic flight and I couldn't find the details of the journey anywhere on the internet. so I figured I'd give this a shot.

I was not disappointed.  If anyone wants to know the nuts and bolts about the flight, this is an excellent and detailed exposition, and generally very accurate, as I later found out.

The first half of the movie goes into great detail about how the flight was planned, and how the plane -- ""The Spirit of St. Louis"" -- was named and made to order in San Diego, all of this is in flashback from the night before Lindbergh leaves.  Then, when he finally takes off, the film does a wonderful montage accompanied by Franz Waxman's soaring divided strings that recapitulates all the characters from earlier in the film.  Just beautifully done.

The second half of the film is the flight itself, which has some tense moments, but boredom is alleviated by a few flashbacks on Lindbergh's earlier life. Finally, he lands in Paris, is mobbed, and the film ends somewhat abruptly.

I was surpised by the film on many levels.  The acting, the set design, the score, the edits, were all first class (I did not know it was a Billy Wilder film.) Not surprising for a Billy Wilder film was the emphasis on being a good person (a ""mensch"" as described in some of his other films), somewhat surprising was the emphasis -- especially at the end -- on faith, togetherness, and working together for a common goal.  Just a wonderful evocation of Americanism from a bygone day, and a film that actually manages to communicate the importance of Lindbergh's accomplishment. Wilder also had a hand in the script, with many clever plants and payoffs and witty cross references. Highly Recommended.",1468627200,,1769,4.717532467532467

That cycle was repeated throughout the entire movie...5 minutes of movie then 15 minutes of the exact same commercial, then 5 minutes of movie, etc.
By the way, this disc from SOUTHWEST MEDIA (Fulfilled by Amazon)  arrived on time...possibly a bit early...and was in excellent condition.  I am very satisfied with my order and how it was handled.
Would love to see more quality movies like this one created and made available here on Amazon!  OH, and Amazon, where is the DISC of ""Medicine River"" with Graham Greene???

851889,5,6304359659,"Some of the comments by viewers and authors state that ""this was the ""first solo flight across the Atlantic"" this is erroneous. Lindbergh's flight was simply the ""FIRST nonstop flight, across the Atlantic,"" , period. Solo or not, since none had achieved this feat before, even when accompanied by a crew.. In fact all those who tried to do with with a crew and in a multi-engine aircraft died in the attempt. Lindbergh had both the expertise and the courage to do it solo and in a single engine aircraft, because he would rather carry more fuel than a co-pilot or more crew and, as he stated himself: "" Since multi engine aircraft cannot continue flying if one engine failed, having more than one engine increases the probability of failure"". So, he did it alone and in a single engine plane. So let's stop this nonsense of referring to his flight as ""the first solo crossing of the Atlantic"" and call it ""the first ever crossing of the Atlantic non stop by an aircraft"", period!!.",1458950400,,981,4.611428571428571

The utter blandness of the trip across the Atlantic, though well proving the plane and pilot's quality and heroic endurance, makes for a relatively mundane story.

852041,5,6304359659,"I liked this film a lot, I spend a nice moment watching it and I will keep my DVD for another viewing. Combined efforts of Billy Wilder and James Stewart made into something really worth seeing. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

This film is a faithful adaptation of Charles Lindbergh's 1953 autobiographical account of his historic flight in 1927, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1954. It begins with his early days in aviation and culminates in his 33-hour transatlantic flight in the ""Spirit of St. Louis"" monoplane from his take off at Roosevelt Field to his landing at Le Bourget Field in Paris on May 21, 1927. In the between are some juicy and very amusing anecdotes, some quasi surrealistic conversations with various students Lindberg was trying to teach how to fly and all his efforts to build an airplane with which cross the Atlantic.

The narration is very much to the point, without many digressions, but nevertheless never boring, not even for one moment. The flight itself is a surprisingly tense, dramatic and very moving human adventure - even if quite obviously I knew how it was going to end, there were moments I was biting my nails all the same... There is drama, there is tension, there is humour, but no romance, not even one little bit - and in this film it is actually a very precious thing. At 135 minutes this is a long film, but I swear I didn't see the time fly by.

James Stewart aced this role as virtually every other he ever accepted. He was probably the best actor to play Lindbergh because he was also the best pilot in history of Hollywood - he served in USAAF with great distinction during WWII, reached the rank of Brigadier General in US Air Force and even flew as observer on a bombing mission in Vietnam in 1966. This film proved also once more that Billy Wilder was a great director - one of the greatest ever.

This is a classic and a really great film. To buy, watch, keep and re-watch. ENJOY!",1444348800,,1964,4.53954802259887

852592,4,6304359659,"Having just finished Bill Bryson's extremely well written and highly informative book, ""One Summer: America, 1927"" focusing primarily on Lindbergh's historic solo flight across the Atlantic, I learned many heretofore unknown facts about the Colonel. First, is that from his landing in Paris in May pretty much through the early 1930's (when the hoopla surrounding him was trebled by the horrendous kidnapping and murder of his firstborn son), he was without doubt the most adored, nay worshipped, human being on the planet. Beginning with his tickertape parade in New York (attended by four million people) through his triumphal tour of the U.S. and South America, he was showered with a veneration and awe that is still unparalleled in even today's tsunami of celebrity worship.

Next, is that he was an almost supernaturally odd individual.  Being portrayed in the media as a painfully shy, modest and self-effacing 25 year old superhero, he presented himself, without apologies, as an automaton who neither enjoyed nor acknowledged the galactic praise heaped upon his lanky shoulders.  Much of it stemmed from his relationship with his mother; a cold, loveless individual who refused to hug or kiss him (she would shake his hand at night while tucking him in) and expressed neither concern when he took off from Roosevelt Field nor relief when he landed 33 hours later at Le Bourget in Paris.  She turned down an invitation to stay with President and Mrs. Coolidge in the White House for his reception and instead slipped away to stay alone in a Manhattan apartment.  All the universal cachet Lindbergh had built up as one of the bravest explorers of all time was neatly squandered when he became chummy with Henry Ford and championed not only American industry and aviation but anti-Semitic platforms, racist immigration restrictions and eugenics; agreeing with dubious social theorists and amateur geneticists that non-white, non-Aryan races were all inferior beings who needed to be eliminated by genetic engineering and even legalized embryonic genocide.  Not to mention his rapturous and public love affair with Hermann Goering, Adolf Hitler and the political and moral righteousness of National Socialism.  Even after the Nuremberg Laws, Kristallnacht and eventually Auschwitz and Treblinka, Lindbergy (and his wife, Anne Morrow) felt the Nazis did not commit horrendous crimes against humanity but simply made a few bad decisions.  Roosevelt wanted nothing to do with him and after championing isolationism and ""America First"" in the days before Pearl Harbor and although he served in a consulting capacity in World War II, the damage had been done.  While Americans can be forgiving, they do not forget. By the 1950s Lindbergh's reputation was not only knocked off its pedestal, it lay ignobly in the dirt of history.

All that being said, I always wondered why ""The Spirit of St. Louis"" suffered such an ignominious fate at the box office in 1957. After reading Bryson's book I understand why.  The film, had it been directed by Frank Capra, William Wellman or even John Ford and starring someone with less distracting star power than James Stewart (""South Pacific"" co-star John Kerr was said to have been considered for the lead), the film could have literally flown under the radar and landed with a bit less turbulence at the box office.  However, it seems so far out of Billy Wilder's league, so devoid of the wit, grit and sardonic frisson that marked his best work that one feels he is struggling to pull on a boot three sizes too small for his feet.

Stewart (having recently been commissioned a Brigadier General in the Air Force Reserve) was a celebrated World War II veteran who flew 25 bombing missions over Germany and remains to this day one of the most decorated actors who served in the military. His unassuming, heroic soul was on par with the young Lindbergh's.  However, as John Ford once warned a co-star to watch out for Stewart, who he called ""a good country actor"", his gas seems to fill up the entire film without letting us get even a partial glimpse of the Lindbergh of history. It is all Jimmy Stewart, the beloved American icon here and that ultimately prevents the film from getting any emotional thrust or drag.  Picture Jefferson Smith or George Bailey flying over Washington or Bedford Falls and you'll begin to see the problem.

The production design on TSOSL is superb, as is the attention to historic correctness of the three identical reproduction of the Ryan monoplane down to the smallest details.  Surprisingly for the time, there is very little blue screen and models and Wilder gives us some magnificent location shots of not only America's heartland but New England, Newfoundland, Ireland, England and, of course, the City of Lights itself.  Franz Waxman's score is also pleasantly understated and, while he often used a heavy dramatic hand (i.e., The Nuns Story, Taras Bulba, etc.) here he lets the drama drive the score forward and not the other way around.  Interestingly, the flight over the ocean is fairly standard and, aside from his dozing off and struggling to keep aloft with ice on the wings, that is not the most exciting part of the film.  Lindbergh's takeoff from Roosevelt Field, his plane bogged down in mud and struggling to climb over looming power lines and treetops and his landing at Le Bourget, exhausted, disoriented and dazed by the impressionistic slashes of blinding searchlights, are briskly and powerfully shot and constitute, in my opinion, the heart and excitement of the film.  Everything in between, well it is sort of the standard, 1950s schmaltz and syrup biopic in the mold of ""The Great Caruso"", ""The Buster Keaton Story"" and ""The Jolson Story"". Not the way our heroes actually were, but the way we wanted them to be: self effacing, noble, chaste and virtuous.  Labels that cannot be applied to the racist, white supremacist, all-too-human yet undoubtedly brave Charles Lindbergh.",1416787200,2,5969,5.038578680203046

852695,5,6304359659,"Until I saw this movie that tells the story of the great aviator, Charles Lindbergh, I thought I knew all about him and what he did. How wrong I was -- I am positively sure that no aviator today would ever attempt to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, in the same type aircraft as he flew, using nothing but dead-reckoning to reach Paris from New York.

As with all great people, this man had at times, nothing to go on but a mountain of courage, a young man who followed his dream, a young man who believed that if you can see it in your mind's eye, you can do it in real life. Wow -- what an amazing feat -- but much more than all that, Charles Lindbergh broke through the barrier of unbelief amongst the general public, that aviation was a thing of the future, and that we would all benefit from it over time.

Remember now, when he was flying -- there was no such thing as Air-Traffic-Controllers or Towers directing airplanes onto busy runways at major airports around the world. No such thing existed, only in his mind and heart and dreams. This man was using a compass, an inferior compass by today's standards, to help him reckon his position of staying on course to his destination (Paris) from New York. At times he was flying his small plane as low as 20 feet above the waves (Atlantic Ocean) -- with no front windshield either! He had to look out a side-window to see anything - imagine someone trying something like that today -- almost 4,000 miles distance -- and staying awake, too - for the entire flight (there was no such thing as auto-pilot) - -

Not only that, other aviators of his time were attempting the same feat, but most had been lost at sea or crashed before they could get started on the journey. The deck was stacked against this young pilot -- and it took a group of individuals who strongly believed in his dream too -- to make it happen for him  - -financiers, engineers, aviator enthusiasts and philanthropists, none of whom would have wasted their time or money investing in him if they didn't believe he could do it. But - it was a HUGE RISK - -he almost didn't clear the trees on take-off! Imagine that - all the planning, the years of practice (he was a mail-carrier by airplane, when landing a plane meant finding a good cow pasture to touch down), and the money invested -- he almost didn't get off the ground on take-off -- the weather was bad, and his plane's wheels barely cleared the tree tops on take off -- otherwise he too, like his competitors, would have crashed and burned, and we would never have the true story of THE SPIRIT OF ST LOUIS. Buy the movie -- watch it -- and let your own dreams re-ignite once again -- and follow those dreams -- just like this young kid did back in the 20s, a young man by the name of Charles Lindbergh, for whom all of NYC turned out upon his victorious return from Europe, with a ticker-tape parade!",1408406400,,2879,4.345724907063197

My bro, who writes film reviews for a living, was not impressed.  [...]

But I really like the film and have seen it several times.  How do you tell the story of a guy flying alone for 34 hours over the Atlantic.  Not a lot of action.  So, the flashback motif really makes it work.

Lindy was certainly the most famous and celebrated man in the world after his flight.  He rarely had a private moment to himself thereafter, which made life miserable for an extremely private person such as Lindbergh.  The film gives a hint of this at the very end.  (Not a spoiler alert.)  If you are interested in his story before and after the flight, then I strongly recommend One Summer: America, 1927, by Bill Bryson, which is really a wonderful book.  ( www.amazon.com/One-Summer-America-Bill-Bryson/dp/0767919408 )

My guess is the principal reason this film was a box office flop was because people in the 1950s were still angry at Lindy because of his infatuation with Nazi Germany, and his role in the America First movement prior to Pearl Harbor.  He was a great pilot and a fine engineer, but he was somewhat lacking in the common sense department.",1398643200,2,1181,4.669902912621359

853034,4,6304359659,"""The Spirit of St. Louis"" is an entertaining gripping film of Charles Lindbergh and the first transatlantic flight from New York to Paris in May 1927.  The film directed by the talented Billy Wilder is quite good, from impressive aerial cinematography to James Stewart in one of his best acting performances. The ""Spirit of St. Louis"" funded by businessmen from St. Louis, and designed in large part by Lindbergh, propels him through extraordinary moments and some close calls documented in the 33 1/2 hours of his famous flight. Once Lindbergh departs from New York, the audience is whisked up in the air and is treated to colorful scenes of his early beginnings as he reminisces on board the plane.  The flashbacks showcase Lindbergh's experiences and provides the viewer an insight into his love affair with aviation. The last few hours of Lindbergh's flight are intense.  Not only does the film document when the ""Spirit of St. Louis"" begins to accumulate ice on its wings, but portrays the incredible toll on Lindbergh of sheer exhaustion as he desperately fights from falling asleep.  The film culminates with his famous landing to Le Bourget Field outside of Paris greeted by cheering crowds of thousands, followed by a hero's welcome in America woven with footage of the real event.

853151,5,6304359659,"Billy Wilder's glorious telling of one of the most famous feats in aviation history, the lone crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in 1927 by 26-year-old Charles Lindbergh in his single engine aircraft named The Spirit of St. Louis, is one of the best movies ever made about aviation. It's also a terrific character study. I mention his age because Lindbergh - on whose book of the same name Wilder based his screenplay - is played by 49-year-old James Stewart. Despite that difference, Stewart is perfect simply being himself and not attempting to imitate ""Lucky Lindy,"" as Lindbergh came to be called. Stewart completely embodies his character and personality - his spirit, if you will. The story begins just before the takeoff, from Long Island's Roosevelt Field, on May 20. As Lindbergh tries to grab some last-minute rest, Wilder takes us back to his first days in aviation and his quest to find a plane capable of flying nonstop from New York to Paris. Wilder and screenwriter Charles Lederer continue to use flashbacks intermittently through the movie. Most of the time Wilder also uses a full-size replica of the Spirit for the aerial scenes, and it's thrilling to see it take wing over land and water, particularly in one sweeping shot, as the plane flies low across the harbor in St. Johns, Newfoundland, and out toward the vast and foreboding Atlantic. Out there and through one long, occasionally terrifying night, Lindbergh fought sleep deprivation, darkness and icing of his wings to make it through to the next morning. That flyby scene is one of the greatest in all of cinema, and The Spirit of St. Louis is a grand re-creation of one of the most heroic episodes in aviation. Yes, it was extremely courageous of Lindbergh to attempt the first trans-oceanic crossing alone, without a copilot or even a radio (he wanted to spare the weight), and there are several times when he could have been lost along the way. But the most gripping, amazing part of the journey was his landing at Le Bourget field near Paris. There, after flying 3500 miles in 33 hours, with no sleep for nearly three days, Lindbergh managed to put the Spirit down safely, with no communications help from the ground and no runway lights. In my humble opinion, this was the most astounding aviation feat ever, and Wilder and Stewart portray it with great drama - even though you know how the flight ends. This is a dreamy, wonderful movie, and though sordid parts of Lindbergh's personal life have surfaced over the years to tarnish his image, this achievement cannot be diminished. Gorgeously shot in CinemaScope by Robert Burks and J. Peverell Marley, the movie features a lofty score by Franz Waxman - his best work.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1380758400,2,2948,5.208421052631579

853155,5,6304359659,"Charles Lindbergh was one of the great flyers, and this excellent film tells the story well.  The May 1927 flight of the ""Spirit of St. Louis"" across the Atlantic Ocean to Paris was an epic achievement by a great pilot and a great flight team.  In real life Charles Lindbergh was known to be a somewhat distant personality, while actor James Stewart's irrepressibly warm personality cannot be suppressed in his Lindbergh role despite Stewart's stellar acting skills.  No matter.  Stewart is a magnificent Charles Lindbergh, and carries off the role in a thoughtful, even wistful way that makes this a spellbinding film worthy of repeated viewings.

The film is told as Lindbergh first seeks financial backers, and then a suitable airplane for his dream of flying the New York-Paris flight.  This linear story is embellished with flashbacks that tell the story of how Lindbergh became a pilot, and indeed a redoubtable one.  This is important because in 1927, when Lindbergh made the flight, it is probably not too much to say that this achievement was near the cutting edge of the state-of-the-art for flight engineering.  This enables the viewer to appreciate the difficulties faced by Lindbergh and his aeronautical engineering team, first in designing an airplane that was suitable for flight of this duration, and secondly, Lindbergh's challenge of navigating the plane thousands of miles, much of it across the Atlantic Ocean with no navigation checkpoints, solely by compass and dead-reckoning.  Truly an incredible feat; not made easier by the fact that Lindbergh had to stay awake for the entire multi-day flight.

Lindbergh's landing in Paris is no doubt one of the most dramatic moments in history and this film does a fine job of allowing the viewer to appreciate why.  A great film.  RJB.",1375228800,3,1800,5.064406779661017

853536,5,6304359659,"Now nine decades removed from Lindburgh's solo trans-Atlantic flight, the importance of his accomplishment and even his name are fading from our consciousness. The movie was only 30 years removed from Lindburgh's feat, but we are now some 56 years beyond that. Few people with any awareness of that event remain to reflect on it.

This is an uncluttered storyline. The movie is flashback-driven, filling in earlier flying-related events in Lindburgh's life or his efforts to acquire a plane to attempt the Atlantic crossing.

Stewart was really too old to play Lindburgh (Stewart was 49 by 1957, versus Lindburgh's 25 in 1927). But, who else would one have cast for that role? As a character, Lindburgh was quiet, self-effacing, idealistic, but confident in his convictions ... which describes many Stewart roles. Importantly, Stewart was a pilot. (By the time of the filming, he was a full colonel in the USAF reserve and a decorated WWII combat squadron and group leader.) Stewart's every move in the Spirit of St. Louis are natural and automatic to a pilot -- convincing, to say the least.

Yes, this is about flying and Lindburgh. But, it is also about pushing the envelope, which makes this movie timeless -- a good reminder of the need to explore, to innovate, and, even, to risk failure in the pursuit of success.",1360454400,,1320,4.910313901345291

On the surface recounts the famous 1927 flight of Charles Lindbergh - the first successful TransAtlantic crossing via airplane; fulfilling the dream of quickly bridging Europe to The Americas and vastly expanding global commerce and communication. The same dream that had killed or seriously injured more than a dozen courageous pilots prior to Lindy's successful attempt.

But this movie is so much more than a docudrama, it's a film that defines understated heroism - the heart of adventure without the sappy sentimental tropes of so many productions. Simultaneously showcasing the impact one person can produce when they have a singular focus and belief. That, coupled with exquisitely rich Technicolor cinematography, captures the compelling story of Lindbergh's death-defying journey over the open ocean.

Suspect younger audiences, even if they were to screen the film, will never fully appreciate the sheer terror that these early aviators faced. There was no rescue plan, no back-up, no hope of being saved. In volunteering to undertake this challenge - death was the end result for many. What happened to Charles Nungesser and Francois Coli, competitors of Lindbergh who are mentioned in the film, has never been solved. The team along with their plane, The White Bird, was never found and is considered one of aviation's longest unanswered mysteries.

Outside of our armed forces, you just don't see that kind of bravery anymore. Everything today is just so completely wired for safety, safety, safety - it's not at all impressive when someone flies around the world or sails the open seas ""alone"" - when they're literally hooked into every known modern convenience and dozens of safety nets/supports, just in case. It's not worthy of inclusion in the same breath when discussing these pioneers. Actually, it's quite insulting.

And believe me when I say: I do understand and appreciate that the film doesn't delve into the man's life with an equally detailed eye toward his less than admirable traits; glossing over his racist underpinnings and an engineer's coldly calculating view of the world versus the effect on real living people. Which makes Jimmy's interpretation all the more enjoyable; lending a warm humanity to the character that Lindbergh himself seemingly lacked, at least publicly. *Importantly, none of that was known in 1927*.

In screening films like this, but especially from the 50's period in American filmmaking, I treat them just like any film: Life-like representations, not real-life depictions.

Movie Note:

Interestingly, Lindbergh himself wasn't at all pleased that Stewart, who was almost 50 years old at the time, would be portraying him in the film. When he took The Spirit into the air he was all of 25, nearly half the age of the veteran actor during production. But Jimmy felt, correctly based on my first introduction to the film, that he could capture the essence of the character - to properly portray the courage and energy of that young man. Again, it was disheartening to hear that Lindbergh was rude to Stewart when they first sat down across from each other, a meeting for the actor to get a better sense of the man. Courteous and polite was Jimmy defined. But still, it must've been a huge letdown for him to be treated that way, not because he was a 'star' but because he was a real-life aviator and fellow combat veteran.

Personal Note:

Pathetically, in the second decade of the 21st century, due to a fractured societal landscape and completely dysfunctional educational system - this astounding achievement is quickly becoming (has become?) a forgotten chapter in American History. His incredible adventure fading away in the tsunami wash of vacuous social media, pointless mind-numbing apps and thoroughly worthless singing/dancing clubs.

853793,4,6304359659,"The girl who provided the pocket mirror before the plane took off (and they showed her after the take off, and again with her on a train): Were they planting the suggestion that she might be Anne Morrow - the future Mrs. Lindbergh?  Apparently not, because both IMDb and Wikipedia identify the character as ""Mirror Girl"" - and Wikipedia says Lindbergh met Anne Morrow in Mexico.

I was curious about the plane the studio used.  The cockpit mock-up appears to be a faithful replica of the original plane.  So does the exterior.  Wikipedia: ""In order to accurately depict the transatlantic flight, three replicas were made of the ""Spirit of St. Louis"" for the various film units stateside, in Europe, and for studio work. Two of the replicas are still in flightworthy condition, with one currently on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan and a second replica at the EAA AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.""
No wonder the film cost $6 million to make back in 1957.

The widescreen format makes for some great images - it would have been a crime to crop this down to a 4:3 'pan and scan'.

853797,5,6304359659,"SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS is a lengthy film starring James Stewart.  The first half of the film shows Mr. Stewart's efforts at fund-raising along with details of the manufacture of the airplane.  At first, Mr. Stewart met with an executive at an airplane company in New York City, played by Richard Deacon (of all people).  Richard Deacon is distinguished as playing the father of Lumpy Rutherford of the LEAVE IT TO BEAVER series.  (I treasured every moment of Mr. Deacon's appearance in this movie.)  Then, Mr. Stewart's backers, bankers in St. Louis, send Mr. Stewart to Ryan Airlines in San Diego.  At this point, the viewer is treated to details of cutting, sawing, riveting, and polishing, used in the assembly of the airplane.  I am grateful to the cinematographer for dwelling lovingly on these details in the assembly of the craft.

FUN FACTS.  To provide some facts from Wikipedia:  The Spirit of St. Louis is the single engine monoplane that was flown solo by Charles Lindbergh on May 20-21, 1927, on the first non-stop flight from New York to Paris.  Lindbergh won the $25,000 Orteig Prize.  The airplane was designed by Donald A. Hall of Ryan Airlines in San Diego, CA.  Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Airfield, on Long Island, New York and landed 33 hours, 30 minutes later at Le Bourget Aerodrome in Paris, France.

TOUCHES OF HUMOR.  Humor and various personal touches find their way into this techno-biography.  We find humor in a scene in a cafe, where Mr. Stewart plots his journey on the wooden wall, and where Paris is designated by a knot in a wallboard.  When the airplane is finished, all the employees of Ryan Airlines place their signature in a panel of the airplane, and the company's dog places his pawprint on the panel too. (This is similar to the signatures of Apple's employees that were placed inside the earliest Apple Computers.)  THE SPIRIT OF ST.LOUIS also provides humor in the form of a reverend, who is given flying lessons by Mr. Stewart, where the reverend assures Mr. Stewart that he has separate prayers for take-off, landing, and for rough wind.  Little personal touches in this film also come from repeated references to a medallion of St. Christopher.  This medallion is such a recurring theme, that the film could have been named, THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING ST.CHRISTOPHER MEDALLION.

According to Wikipedia: Medallions with St. Christopher's name and image are frequently displayed in automobiles.  St. Christopher medals in Spanish have the phrase ""Si en San Crist&oacute;bal conf&iacute;as, de accidente no morir&aacute;s"" (""If you trust St. Christopher, you won't die in an accident"").

CLIFF-HANGERS.  The film has a few cliff-hangers, relating to the initial take-off, Mr. Stewart's habit of falling asleep at the stick, the wings icing up, and apparently running out of gas over France.

FLASH-BACKS DURING THE LONG FLIGHT.  The second half of THE SPIRIT OF ST.LOUIS takes place over the Atlantic Ocean.  Obviously, there is not going to be too much to describe about this lengthy flight, and so the film uses this time period as forum for showing various amusing and adventuresome flash-backs in Mr. Stewart's earlier life, for example, his adventures as a barnstorming pilot.  None of these adventuresome flash-backs disclose romantic trysts.  Perhaps if this part of the movie showed Mr. Lindbergh's earlier trysts with young ladies (either factual or fictional), the film would have done better at the box office.  At any rate, the fact that this film contains no hint or suggestion of romance or of dilly-dallying, lends credence to the film as a historically accurate bio-pic.

CONCLUSION.  THE SPIRIT OF ST.LOUIS does have a take-home lesson for present-day viewers.  The night before the flight, Mr. Stewart slept, at most, one hour.  This means that he began his long flight across the Atlantic, already weary from a sleepless night.  And so, people who fail to fall asleep, for example, on the day before an important presentation or interview, can take solace that they are not the first to lose sleep the night before an important event.  By the way, Phyllis Coates has a small part SPIRIT OF ST.LOUIS.  She is renowned for playing the original Lois Lane in the black & white television serial.",1293321600,2,4263,4.978783592644978

853955,4,6304359659,"Everyone knows the story of Charles Lindbergh. His trans-Atlantic flight was a sensation in the 20s and inspired songs like ""Lucky Lindy"" and dances like the Lindy Hop. He started as an airmail flyer, but his love of flight and belief in it as an industry inspired him to attempt the impossible. The world held their breath hoping he would achieve his goal, to fly from New York to France without stopping. But it seemed impossible. He proved them wrong.

Billy Wilder directs this aviation adventure expertly. The setting is authentic without being overbearing. The actors wear costumes from the era, but nothing jumps up and screams, ""Hey guys, this is 1927!"" Stewart is great as always. He is a bit too old for the part, but his Lindy haircut is a nice assimilation to the role. He is well suited to biopics, because he can make even the unlikable seem sweet and genuine. (Not to say that Lindbergh was not a likable man.) He carries the bulk of the film on his shoulders with his inner dialogues while confined to the airplane. There are lots of great aereal shots including gorgeous overhead shots of land and a breath-taking shot looking up at the sun peeking through the clouds.

This is a slow-moving and deliberate movie with scenes of tension mixed in, but it is really a showcase for those with a love of flying, like Stewart and writer Wendell Mayes certainly had.",1229472000,,1376,4.658436213991769

Wilder broke up the monotony with flashbacks about Lindbergh's life in aviation. Some of these flashbacks are a bit tedious.

Wilder apparently remained faithful to Lindbergh's own account of the journey. (I hope to read this book someday.) The film built enough suspense to have me cheering Stewart on at the end. I felt overwhelmed when the plane touched down in Paris.",1215820800,,676,4.878260869565217

854041,4,6304359659,"""The Spirit of St. Louis"" is Billy Wilder's film tribute to one of the best figures in aeronautical history, remembered for the first nonstop solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean in May 1927 with James Stewart (a little too old for the part) playing Charles Lindbergh...

As a tribute it is eloquent enough and, although a few nice liberties may have been taken with historical fact, the motion picture describing the detailed odyssey before and after the Paris flight on May 20-21 in the monoplane ""Spirit of St. Louis.""

Although the lengthy internal monologue employed during the journey may be disappointing to an audience, the truth is that it helps keep the picture focused tightly on its essential point... Stewart dignified the portrait of one of the greatest adventurers in the air the world has ever know, departing, in a highly modified single engine monoplane, from Long Island, New York to Paris, France...

No action is depicted in the trip, only some flashbacks to break up the monotony of the long flight... But there is superb determination of the ordeal of a brave and talented pilot decided to fly alone... His equation is simple: less weight (one engine, one pilot) would increase fuel efficiency and allow for a longer flying range, but with so much risk... Lindbergh's claim to fame was doing something that many had tried and failed...

Even though Wilder has bravely put it upon the screen in a calm, unhurried fashion, it comes out as biography of intense restraint and power... But it is James Stewart's performance (controlled to the last detail) that gives life and strong, heroic stature to the principal figure in the film...

From it there, emerges an awareness of a clever, firm but truly humble man who tackles a task with resolution, plans as much about it as he can, makes his decisions with courageous finality and then awaits with only one thought in mind, to get to Paris... In his efforts to cut off the plane's weight, any item considered too heavy or unnecessary was left behind...

The record-setting flight proved not only to be a fight with the elements and a test of navigation, but also a long battle against fatigue... A busy schedule and an active mind kept Lindbergh up all of the previous night... Still, he managed to stay conscious enough to keep the monoplane from crashing and landed at Le Bourget Aerodrome, near Paris, 33 hours and 30 minutes after leaving New York...

Stewart gives an able portrait of a brave pilot who attains legendary status, emphasizing the intention and dominant resolution to fly nonstop 5,810 kilometers (3,610 miles) across the Atlantic...

Photographed in CinemaScope and WarnerColor and backed by Franz Waxman's beautiful music, the film effectively captures the pioneering spirit of the era and the hero's ultimate achievement since he takes off, that day, from Roosevelt wet field, and clears telephone wires at the end of the runway...",1168732800,8,2924,4.940936863543788

The widescreen is a Godsend for those of us who were annoyed with the VHS version's constant panning, and the audio is greatly improved.

854045,5,6304359659,"Every year there's one can't-miss much-anticipated red-hot big-budget title with the right combination of star, director and subject matter that fails miserably at the box-office. This year it was Superman Returns. In 1982 it was Blade Runner. In 1957 it was Billy Wilder's The Spirit of St Louis, a film that had everything - top director, huge star, best-selling true story about an American hero - except enough of an audience to cover its costs. Maybe the public still remembered Lucky Lindy's anti-Semitism and his loud admiration for Nazi Germany's achievements before the war (neither covered in the film, which ends with his arrival in Paris before the legend got too tarnished). Maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just going to be one guy stuck in a cockpit for two hours. Certainly Wilder and co-writer Wendell Mayes are aware of the dramatic pitfalls of Lindbergh's relatively uneventful flight, alternating between a well-executed flashback structure to key points in his life and the build-up to the flight itself. Once the film is airborne, it's both surprising and suspenseful, finding genuine drama in his attempts to stay awake and to navigate without proper instruments.

It also builds up a quite remarkable sense of dread that's unlike anything else in Wilder's filmography, allied to a real sense of the epic: shots like the ominous storm clouds over the hanger in the dark dawn before the flight carry a real chill of foreboding to them. Even the typically muted and problematic WarnerColor adds to the film rather than detracts from it. Along with the superb use of CinemaScope, there's a remarkable score from Franz Waxman: majestic, soaring but filled with understated menace, and cleverly used as part of the fabric of the film rather than mere musical accompaniment. The film does lose points for implying, though never actually saying outright, that this was a race to be the first to fly the Atlantic - in fact, Lindbergh was the third man to fly across the Atlantic after almost completely forgotten Brits Alcock and Brown's astonishing flight eight years earlier - but it's still a remarkably tense and engrossing adventure story that deserved the success it never found.

Warner's new restoration is light on film-related extras - only footage of the star-studded premiere and the original trailer, alongside a likeable Joe McDoakes short and a Speedy Gonzalez cartoon (Tex Avery's Little Johnny Jet, included on another James Stewart title, would have been a more appropriate choice of toon) - but the 2.55:1 widescreen transfer is quite excellent.",1162080000,,2608,5.091121495327103
854046,5,6304359659,"If I must describe The Spirit of St Louis with one word, that is extraordinary! A pilot and real-life hero is  brilliantly portrayed by great actor, who was also a pilot and real-life hero in his own right!

Movies are not just entertainment, movies are MAGIC! Sometimes I wish, I could go back to the good, old days when life was simpler and there wasn't so much useless information floating around: no countless ""reviews"", no ""making of the feature"", no trivia, no quotes. You enter the theatre, you  are instantly transported to another world and there is nothing to spoil the experience for you. I am writing this to warn you- don't read any reviews before you see The Spirit of St Louis. I made this mistake and I regret it. Did I really needed to know how old was James Stewart when the movie was shot? I wish everyone in their late 40s looks as terrific as Jimmy did and could easily pass for 20 plus!  I don't understand why some people make such a big deal of something insignificant  that does not affect the film at all.

In 1927, Charles Lindbergh flew alone in a single engine airplane from Roosevelt Field in New York , across the entire North Atlantic Ocean to Le Bourget Field in Paris -33 hours and 30 minutes non-stop flight!  The Spirit of St Louis is the story  of this flight and the man who made it happen. James Stewart's performance as Lindbergh is exceptional! It will keep you engaged and deeply emotionally involved form the start to the end. You will feel Lindbergh's exhaustion during the long and lonely flight and you will admire his determination and stamina.  The cinematography is beautiful and the aerial photography is breathtaking. I wish for a better music score, one that would complement Lindbergh's sacred love for the sky, but that's a minor complaint. Jimmy's performance is so powerful, that you soon forget anything else and keep fingers crossed for Lindy to lend his little airplane in one peace. He does it  in a dramatic and triumphant end that lives you totally fascinated and inspired!

The Spirit of St. Louis is a special film. It is about  glorious victory of  human mind, body and spirit that changed our lives forever  and at the same time it's a triumph for James Stewart. It is not a secret that his request to portray Lindbergh  was turned down many times before he finally got the green light. We can only be grateful for his perseverance, for it paid off beautifully. I have no idea why this film was not acclaimed 50 years ago but time works in its favour and people recognise its significance.  It ranks #69 on the American Film Institute's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time and it is one of Jimmy Stewart's greatest accomplishments!

The DVD transfer is nice Anamorphic and there are few extras included in the DVD: theatrical trailer, ""The Spirit of St Louis"" Premiere, a short comedy ""So, Your Life Wants to Work"" and a cartoon. I really enjoyed the trailer and the documentary, but I felt let down by the studio for including the two, non-related to the film short stories instead of an interview with  James Stewart perhaps. There is not much credible information out there  about his extraordinary work and his  exemplary life and I feel that something has to be done. After all, James  Maitland Stewart is one of the greatest actors of all time and one of the most honourable people who ever lived on Earth!",1160956800,4,3380,4.618729096989966

Subsequently I chose engineering as a profession.

Had it been made 10 years earlier, it would not have been Cinemascope, the sound would have suffered, and Billy Wilder might not have directed.

This was a film Stewart wanted to make for years; but was repeatedly turned down.  James Dean was even considered for the role.  Despite the fact that Stewart was already in this 40's (Lindbergh was 25 at the time), Stewart's persistence paid off and Warner Bros. Studios finally relented and let him star as one of American's greatest aviators.  The life of Charles A. Lindbergh is told in a series of memorable flashbacks as he makes his trans-atlantic flight.  His life experiences and the people he met along the way are vividly recounted.

On May 20, 1927, at approximately 7:52 in the morning, Charles Lindbergh took off in the ""Spirit of St Louis"" from Roosevelt Field, Long Island.  A crowd of more than 500 must have thought they had witnessed a miracle as the ""Spirit of St. Louis"" barely managed to clear the telephone wires at the field's edge in terrible weather conditions. Thirty-three and one half-hours and 3,500 miles later Lindbergh landed in Paris, the first to fly the Atlantic alone.  Many great aviators of the time had tried and failed -- some even lost their lives in this attempt.  Along the way, Lindbergh is forced to conquer his fears, snow, sleet and a lack of sleep to rediscover his faith.  On the evening of May 21, at 10:22, ""The Spirit of St. Louis"" touched down at Le Bourget Field. A crowd of more than 100,000 people were there to greet American's Lone Eagle.  His feat electrified a nation and inspired an interest in aviation. Unfortunately, this film flopped at the box office; but as the years have passed, this film has gained in respect and is now recognized as one of Stewart's greatest film accomplishments.

854170,4,6304359659,"The Spirit of St. Louis was a box-office disappointment.  That will never change.  But what may change is the opinions of critics and the public on how this film should be viewed.  It has all of the makings of a successful film: a great director in Billy Wilder, a legend in Jimmy Stewart, and it's based on the autobiography of an American hero in Charles Lindbergh.
No matter what ticket sales were like, it is a well-done film.  One cannot deny the fact that Stewart was not the correct age to play Lindbergh, but it doesn't really take anything away from the film.  Lindbergh always seemed to be more wise than his age would suggest anyhow.
The VHS version is fine, and until the DVD version is released (if ever) this is the only way to go.",1060041600,23,745,4.408759124087592
854171,4,6304359659,"Overall, this is a good movie.  There were a few scenes that dragged a little, and while most of us who know anything about history, know the outcome, but just the same it was a well acted movie, and very entertaining.",1043107200,3,218,4.317073170731708

854173,4,6304359659,"The Spirit of St Louis is not a perfect film.  It is corny, it is idealized, it is superficial, but with all of that to drag it down, it remains a superb entertainment.  The duplicate of the original Spirit is perfect, the filmed locales are beautiful, and the poetic music by Franz Waxman supports the story in a most thrilling and pleasing way.  The complaint that James Stewart was too old for the part has been repeated over and over until it is a virtual cliche today, with a certainty factor of one hundred percent that anyone commenting on the film will crab about how the star was too old.  I would like to go on record as saying that James Stewart played the part perfectly, bubbling with the essential enthusiasm and patented niceness for which he was famous, and even at an age somewhere around fifty he looked just fine.  Take a close look at him next time you watch the film: his skin is smooth, his stomach is flat, and while he may not have looked twenty-five, he looked sufficiently youthful to play the part of a young, idealistic man.  It was a marvelous piece of acting, and I for one would like to do what I can to dispell the notion that the movie is somehow tainted because of James Stewart's age.  As I suggested, take another look with an open mind, and see what you think.",994896000,,1297,4.379166666666666
854174,5,6304359659,"I saw this film in the theater when it was first released.  I was on the edge of my seat, even though I knew it would end successfully.  Now, 41  years later, I'm still on the edge of my seat every time I watch the film.  Why?  Director Wilder has the unique ability to make one forget he's  watching a movie.  We get to be ""in the moment"".  Some may argue  over the heavy use of flashbacks, but in a film where the bulk of the 33+  hour flight is uneventful, they are almost a necessity.  But they aren't  just thrown in.  They're presented in a timely and logical way.  In an age  when our culture looks to ""brand identification"" and ""public  glory"", it's refreshing to watch an event which began with hardly any  notice at all.",966556800,2,730,4.211678832116788
854175,4,6304359659,"The Spirit of St. Louis is a largely entertaining look at an important moment in history.  I have two issues with the film.  First of all, there are too many flashbacks that interrupt the story, although I understand  their purpose of keeping the movie interesting through some of the  uninteresting parts of his flight.  Also, Stewart is too old for the role,  but being the great actor that he is, he still pulls it off convincingly.  This isn't the kind of film I would expect from director Billy Wilder, but  he manages to create tension during the flight that surprised me since I  knew how it would end!  The film also gives the viewer a good idea of some  of the technical aspects that went into creating Lindbergh's successful  attempt, and the viewer also gets a good feel for what it must have been  like to be inside the plane.  Although not a perfect film, The Spirit of  St. Louis entertains and informs, and I enjoyed it.",962496000,4,935,4.514970059880239

In 1927 a young man in a single engine airplane flew non-stop from Roosevelt Field in New York across the North Atlantic to Le Bourget Field in Paris, a distance of 3,610 miles and 33.5 hours. Thats like flying to San Francisco, a route that crosses high mountains. Lindbergh won a prize and fame. Reporters sit in a room and write their stories. Lindy was a former air mail pilot who flew in overcast weather. In flight the motor stopped! A parachute saves him. He reads a newspaper about a failed flight and makes a long-distance telephone call to an aircraft manufacturer. Lindy meets businessmen to raise money for the flight. He explains his plans to them. He goes to New York but the deal falls through.

Slim goes to Ryan Aircraft in San Diego California to work with the builders. They build the modified airplane. It takes off on its test flight successfully. Lindy flies The Spirit of St. Louis back to St. Louis Missouri. Nungesser and Colie failed in their attempt to fly West (against the prevailing winds). Lindy prepares to leave. Should he wait 24 hours for better weather? No. lindy inspects the wet dirt runway. He tests the controls, then takes off! He heads toward New Foundland. Flying low prevents icing. The story about buying a Jenny pads out the story. He runs into fog, which can prevent setting a course to Ireland; but it clears up.

Then its 1,900 miles to Ireland, flying in the dark of night. Lindy reminisces about his past. Flyers entertained crowds. He passes an iceberg in the ocean. It gets colder, ice forms on the airplane. He must get back to warmer air so the ice breaks off. Did he wander off course in the night? Can he keep awake? The morning sun sends its light, he sees fishing boats. He sees small islands, its Ireland. He eats a white bread sandwich. Next he passes Cherbourg and flies to the Seine River to go to Paris. The lack of sleep begins to affect him. Can he land in the dark? Crowds rush to the landing field. He is carried in triumph by the crowds, they shout his name. There is an even large crowd when he returned to New York City.

James Stewart was a B-17 bomber pilot during WW II. He acted in many pictures. Did he often play the same character? To meet the customers expectations, like other actors and actresses. In the future Lindys politics lessened his popularity. The death of his son caused a sensation. Controversy continues over the solution to the kidnapping, based on books published over the last decades. It says director Billy Wilder wrote the screenplay. Its hard to make a long solo flight dramatic.",1519689600,,2615,4.569296375266524

Mind you, I have nothing at all against religion -- what I object to is ignoring it through most of the film and then sticking it in at the end.
