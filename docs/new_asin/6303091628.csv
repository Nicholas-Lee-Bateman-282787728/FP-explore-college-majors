553764,5,6303091628,"Laurel and Hardy successfully create two characters who are themselves as children.
To watch the adult Laurel and Hardy interacting with ""the kids"" is both funny and touching.
The set design is marvelous and inventive.
The editing is also masterful. Interactions between the adult and child version of Oliver, for example, are seamless and completely believable.

Hardy also sings a lullaby to the kids in his beautiful tenor voice.
I do not want to spoil anything, so I can't go into as much detail as I would like.
Suffice it to say that Laurel and Hardy, and little Laurel and Hardy, are endearing and each in his own way, very very funny.

An original an endearing short film.",1236556800,,680,4.754237288135593
553765,5,6303091628,This has to be one of my favorites w/the boys.  The boys loose their jobs w/the circus & they bring home a flea circus & a gorilla-& the rest is history!  I own this on VHS but I'm hoping it comes out on DVD soon.,1189555200,,213,3.7111111111111112
553766,5,6303091628,"This has long been one of my top favorite L&H shorts.  It also has great supporting characters, among them Jimmy Finlayson (the head of the pathetic circus they're working in), Billy Gilbert (the foul-tempered landlord), and Tiny Sanford (as the performer Destructo).  One of the girls in the circus audience is also Stan's daughter Lois, who was about four years old at the time.  The boys are working in a really run-down seedy circus which is on the verge of a collapse.  After their latest embarrassing show, it is resolved that the circus has to be broken up and sold.  Stan gets the flea circus, and Ollie gets the chimp Ethel.  Out of work and a place to stay, they set off to look for a boarding house.  However, this boarding house does not allow animals, and they go to great (and hilarious) lengths to sneak Ethel in after they've already checked into the room.  Things are also complicated because the circus's lion is also prowling around the grounds of the boarding house.

Once inside their assigned room with Ethel, they all try to get some sleep, but given how everything in their world always goes haywire, that's pretty impossible.  The flea circus manages to escape and gets all over the bedsheets, and Ethel doesn't like the idea of having to lie down for the night.  Furthermore, the landlord's estranged wife is also named Ethel, so when he overhears Ollie commanding, ""Ethel, stop that and come to bed,"" he believes his wife is carrying on with these two and charges in with a gun, ranting up a storm the way only Billy Gilbert could.  This rant really puzzles and baffles the boys, since they know Ethel is a chimp and couldn't possibly be the love of this guy's life and the mother of his children!  However, he finds that he's been screaming at a chimp, with the real human Ethel having just come in behind him.  Following this embarrassing but hilarious case of mistaken identity, the chimp Ethel gets hold of the gun and starts firing it, scaring everyone away.

Today of course, most audiences wouldn't be too keen on primates being played by human actors wearing gorilla or chimp suits, even though it was very common back in those days.  To a modern person, it's blatantly obvious that this isn't a real chimp and that this is a person in a chimp suit, but it was standard practice then and we have to accept that.  However, if the viewer can get past this, it's a really funny two-reeler.",1137542400,,2421,4.606060606060606
553767,2,6303091628,"The original 1930 print of this Laurel and Hardy short feature opens with the screen scroll - ""Mr. Laurel and Mister Hardy remained home to take care of the children....Their wives are gone out to target practice.""  This proves to be one of the most humourous segments of the comic pair's highly popular two-reeler wherein they play dual roles, as themselves and as young miniatures Stan Jr. and Oliver Jr., the latter two dwarfed by cleverly constructed oversize sets.  In spite of excellent sound quality for the period and an artfully sung lullaby by Hardy, the piece is overly reliant upon trite sight gags that are merely unimaginative slapstick.  Although we do not see the wives, a framed photograph of Jean Harlow is upon the mantle, a wittily incongrous hint that she may be one of the absent spouses.  Elsewise, this is a gimmick propelled movie, and although one will risk incurring the displeasure of the duo's legion of rabid fans by saying so, the fact remains supreme that when a viewer is consistently aware of what is about to happen before the characters do, any intended interest in them tends to flag.",1124150400,,1121,4.7927461139896375
553768,5,6303091628,"A brilliant introduction for those unfamiliar with the comedies of Laurel and Hardy. They're ordered to leave town by a crusty judge who absolutely hates drunken people. Meeting up with a drunk who's lost his car keys, they help him find them. To show his appreciation, he invites them to go home with him- except it's the wrong house, it's the JUDGE's own home! His wife faints at sight of the intruders, who then revive her with what they take for water- actually bootleg liquor from the man they helped-and everybody gets sozzled. The wife wants to dance, which Ollie nervously declines. ""If you don't want to dance,"" she declares, ""we'll wrestle!"" Thus begins the free-for-all on the lady's bed..and in walks her husband, the prohibition-minded judge! The lights go out and the film's finale sounds like an atom bomb detonating. Vivian Oakland shows her rare comic talent-too rare in my opinion, as she deserved a wider appreciation- and well, it's a pip. Highly recommended!",1080604800,,979,4.9393939393939394
553769,4,6303091628,"Here's a question you haven't heard before: can a gorilla impersonator still generate believability and BIIIIIIIG laughs for audiences in the 21st century?
  This wonderful, zany, slapstick Laurel & Hardy short provides the answer: A resounding YES.
  From start to finish, this short is inspired, even if it is one of the lesser known L&H flicks. Basically, it opens with the boys working in a circus that goes broke. Everyone gets part of the circus. And guess what they get.
  Believe or not, it's not merely a set up. The early circus scenes, with Stan and Ollie dressed in silly costumes, are a howl. Once they get the chimp -- Charles Gemora (make-up artist and gorilla impersonator) -- the hilarious complications begin. The chimp (actually a gorilla) is truly a scene stealer in this fast-paced 1932 flick that boasts several other skilled scene stealers: James Finlayson, Billy Gilbert (you can see here how Gilbert clearly influenced the equally blustering Jackie Gleason in Gleason's Honeymooner skits) and a very persistant lion.
  And there are two additional bonuses: a poignent scene with the chimp involving music (I won't give it away) and some hilarious double entendres as Gilbert listens in at the door (these are worth the price of the tape and more!).
  The version I have is the colorized version -- which again gives solid proof that colorizing these L&H shorts, if done tastefully, actually enhances them.

I have loved The Boys for many years, they always make me laugh and lift my spirits, no matter how many times I have seen their films.  I have watched toddlers imitate Laurel's ""Finger Wi-iggle"" and ""Earsy, Kneesy, Nosey"" perfectly after watching L&H films and that makes my heart shine even more.

Memorable support from Tiny Sandford, Billy Gilbert and Charles Gemora (as tutu-wearing Ethel the gorilla). Slightly overlong, but impossible to dislike.",1422835200,,444,5.529411764705882
