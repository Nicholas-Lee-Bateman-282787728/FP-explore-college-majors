4692483,2,B005GP7F34,"I just finished watching this on the channel of the presenters. There is but so much that you can get in an hour, but this show attempted to once and for all show that poor Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK all by himself without any good reason - we don't need the reason, all we need is to know it!

The good thing about this show is that it does show some footage I had never seen before and it showed Eunis Amos as he appears today. He sticks by his story that all of the shots came from the depository building. It still does not mean that Oswald was the one who shot. The whole point of this show was for new age ""conspiracy theorists"" to forget about alternative views of JFK being killed and just stick to what they tell you to stick with. Clearly, ""conspiracy theorists"" must have persuasive arguments if The History Channel, Discovery Channel and NGC have to keep making shows to counter the ""theories.""

All of these ""detectives"" lead the viewers. One shows film of the depository building window as the limo was rolling buy and he says:""...See, you can see the movement of Lee Harvey Oswald as he is shooting President Kennedy!"" As I was looking at this ""HD"" (I guess they want to use the buzz word ""HD"" to stimulate the thought of a picture being CLEAR and therefore revealing ,more) version of the film, I saw no movement and I certainly did not see Oswald! That old man who saw all of that must be Superman's cousin! If all of that were seen, the case would have indeed been closed. This is a clear case of leading in order to brainwash. You know, they stressed that the film was in HD and NOW you see the movement. Combine this with Euins's statements, ""and there can be no doubts that Oswald did it.""

Another part of this fiction that caught my attention was when these ""master detectives"" claimed that the missed shot missed because it was deflected off of the street light! The proof?  While watching a BLACK and WHITE, speckly, film-grained footage, there was a WHITE SPOT on the street light! Now, is it a surprise to find whites spots on black and white, fuzzy film? Also, the guy failed to explain how the bullet could be shot from the building side of the light and be deflected all the way to the triple underpass! Oh yeah - they did mention that the ORIGINAL light had been replaced so they sadly, could not test out how or where a deflected bullet would have traveled. You would think that a company like Nation Geographic could have gotten an exact duplicate since they were able to get everything else!

They also failed to mention that if the first shot got deflected from the traffic light, how come no one heard it? You would have certainly heard a loud knock if that happened. Even though they show us a white blob on the light, I do not see a BULLET HOLE complete with see-through or black center hole! If this were presented as proof of another shooter, people would eat this up and prove how silly this was. This is yet another pro-government approved version of their murder of JFK which attempts to show the ""experts"" featured in this film as presenting ""final proof"" that Oswald killed JFK - for no good reason and all alone. They fail to take into account that Oswald himself was then offed! So if Oswald killed JFK for a reason only known to him, then how come he did not benefit from it? He ended up dead.

The powers that be want us to believe that JFK was killed by Oswald for no good reason and all by himself. They want us to accept it, not to question it and once and for all - FORGET ABOUT JFK's murder and JFK! These same people want us to forget about 9-11 and it's many, many plot holes. They also want us to forget about seeing those Bin Laden death photos - if they exist. They also want us to forget about the SEAL Team 6 being killed not long after having been credited with killing Bin Laden! You know, it's kind of the way Oswald got killed right after he was credited with killing JFK. Don't believe the propaganda fed to you!

Some will say I sound anti-government, but as smart as these people are to pull these stunts, they are not smart enough to cover their tracks. When tracks are discovered, they simply lie about them or in the case of JFK, they keep coming with new shows to try and cover the plot holes. The problem is, they seem to show who they are every time they invade a new country and they do not feel good about just killing the leaders of that country, they feel that they must kill his entire family too! Then again, RFK, JFK's brother got killed too! While Oswald's pattern was unknown, these true masters of evil's patterns are clear. They own the media so they can get across any propaganda that they wish to.

One last thing. I noticed something to aid in this propaganda. I noticed when they mentioned ""conspiracy theorists,"" they showed two guys. One guy had one eye closed and one eye opened. The other guy had a strange hairdo and BULGING eyes! Both of these guys looked like lunatics and crazed maniacs! I am sure that this was the point the producers of this propaganda piece were trying to get across. If those two guys were the only two known ""conspiracy theorists"" and it is because of them that people doubted the government's story, then you might start thinking that if THOSE guys put forth conspiracy theories, then the whole idea of them is crazy right along with them! I did almost laugh because those guys did indeed look crazy, but of course most ""conspiracy theorists"" are very well educated and not sick looking.

This DVD is only good for the footage. Just watch it on TV like I did so you will not have to pay to get brainwashed. If shows like these are any indication, we may not know the truth of the JFK murder until EVERY person who was age 7 or better in 1963 are long dead. As long as they keep up the same dirty schemes, they do not dare reveal one because then people certainly will demand justice on them all! Ever since the JFK coup took place, all the US has had were puppet presidents - including Obama. That shot that was taken at the White House was yet another warning to Obama that when they give him his second term, he had better STICK TO THE SCRIPT or he could join JFK in an unsolved murder! So far he is sticking to the script. Why are foreigners in charge of US foreign policy? Don't fall for NAZI style propaganda! Those who claim to be the most American are the ones who are least loyal to this country! You know who they are... They put down anything and anyone who does not agree with them.

4692505,4,B005GP7F34,"I found parts of this special very compelling.

I was just 10 years old when Kennedy was assassinated, and for the past 49 years believed that a conspiracy was the cause. I have watched so much Kennedy stuff leading up to the 50th anniversary, that I can't recall what came from which broadcast. But I believe it was JFK, The Lost Bullet, that in slow motion showed that Kennedys head moved forward and down before it moved back and to the left. It moved forward and down from the force of the bullet hitting his skull, but as his brain matter forcefully ejected from the front right of his head, it forced him back and to the left.

I just finished watching Nova's JFK cold case, and it is very convincing that the fatal shot came from Oswald's rifle.

But as of late, I have been thinking about the logic of it all, and it is daunting. Any conspiracy theorist can take one point and build a conspiracy around it, but taken as a whole, it is just illogical.

The idea's that books were built on,
The autopsy and the brain: The Kennedys themselves could have been involved with some of the autopsy confusion, not wanting a detailed accounting for fear that the extent of JFK's illnesses would be revealed.
The shot from the grassy knoll: If so much preparation was taken to make sure that Oswald would be the patsy, and that all of the shots would come from behind, why would the conspirators chance taking a shot from a position that would have blown the back left side of Kennedys head out, which would have been inconsistent with Oswald position?
An entry wound to the front: I never recall anyone at Parkland or Bethesda talking about an exit wound on the back of Kennedys neck. In fact the autopsy photo's show no such wound.
The S.S. tampered with Kennedys body on the flight back: Jackie and his aids were with the casket during the flight back.
The parade route was changed at the last minute to go down Elm: Elm had the only exit onto Stemmons Freeway. There was no exit off of Main.

But take the logic of the situation as a whole and it makes no sense for a conspiracy:

The amount of people needed to coordinate this operation would have been extensive.
* A group of people to handle Ruth Paine in getting Oswald his job. CIA. FBI?
* A group of people to handle Oswald's boss, to make sure he was working at that location on that day. CIA, FBI?
* A group of people to handle Oswald, make sure he wasn't sick that day, make sure he took those curtain rods to work and disposed of them, make sure he ran off after the shooting. CIA, FBI?
* A different group of people where needed to coordinate the motorcade route. The White House, Secret Service, LBJ?
* A different group of people where needed to pull the trigger. CIA assassination teams, the mob, Oswald?
* A different group of people where needed to tamper with the medical evidence. Military autopsy facility personnel?
* A different group of people where needed to dispose of Oswald. The Mob?

There would have been so many people in the know, that keeping it a secret would have been near impossible. The S.S. would have had to communicate with Oswald's handlers, who would have had to communicate with the shooters that Oswald was at work that day, who would have had to let the military personnel know what they needed to fix on the body.
I guess the mob could have been used to keep everyone in line.

It seems that the only person in our government who could not have know what was about to happen, would have been JFK himself.

 And if it had just continued to rain that day................................., all of this extensive preparation would have been for NOT!

Also, the timeline for the trip makes no sense for a conspiracy either:
JFK decides on Texas trip June 5th
Oswald gets job at TSBD Oct 18th
S.S. begin preparations Nov 5th
Trade Mart was chosen on Nov 14th
Final route driven by S.S. Nov 18th
Papers ran the limo route Nov 19th

A conspiracy can be built on any nuance, but as a whole, it looks illogical.",1384387200,5,3997,4.445355191256831

What I found particularly fascinating was the development of the film between the sprockets. Thus revealing never before seen images. Another morbid revelation from the modern forensic analysis is the blood spurt jetting out of the President's head demonstrating that what many conspirators insist was the entry wound is in fact the exit wound.",1379721600,5,611,5.288659793814433
4692507,5,B005GP7F34,"Three shots were fired at President Kennedy that fateful day in Dallas, November 22, 1963.  Two shots hit Kennedy and Gov. Connally, but what happened to the so-called ""Lost Bullet""?  Three shell casings were found below the SE corner window of the Texas School Book Depository (TSBD), and Lee H. Oswald's gun was also found hidden between book boxes.  Eyewitness Amos Euins, 15 years old at the time, saw a man with a gun in the 6th floor SE window fire three shots.  He was instrumental in guiding police to the TSBD within minutes after the assassination.  With digitally restored films of Abraham Zapruder, and other key eyewitnesses, the entire sequence of three shots is logically determined by the preponderance of the evidence.  The ""lost bullet"" is also logically explained.

This is an excellent documentary that logically explains the logistics of all three assassination shots.  Yes, the presentation takes the view that the three shots came from the TSBD, but this is logical as well, because all the forensic evidence points to this conclusion.  Conspiracy theorists like to skewer any presentation that does not agree with their notions of shot(s) from the Grassy Knoll, shot(s) from other buildings, even shot(s) fired within the presidential limousine and street sewers (yes, conspiracy theorists have conjectured that the fatal shot was fired by the limousine driver, and/or came from an assassin who fired the fatal shot from a street sewer!).  Conspiracy theorists will claim that Amos Euins had bad eyesight, and that the Zapruder film shows the fatal shot came from the front.  But, conspiracy theorists have no physical evidence for their multiple theories, and they universally discard the physical forensic evidence that is available because it does not agree with their viewpoint(s).  Conspiracy theorists claim the real assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, innocent, (a ""patsy""), and conjure up multiple assassins placed in various places around Dealy Plaza. Trouble is, they have absolutely NO forensic evidence to support their theories.  In dealing with the physical evidence, conspiracy theorists try to claim that the evidence was planted, tainted, and/or misinterpreted.  Why? because the evidence so strongly points to one assassin - Lee Oswald.  To assert Oswald is an innocent ""patsy"", is not only a gross error in view of the overwhelming incriminating evidence, but is also a gross injustice allowing the one and only assassin go free.

I know full well that this review will be skewered by conspiracy theorists; good and fine, it's totally expected.  But I challenge the potential buyer of this program not to be deterred from viewing this excellent and thorough video documentary just because conspiracists don't agree with it and give it a one-star rating.  View it yourself and come up with your own conclusions, independent of what others think. Think for yourself, consider the evidence carefully, and ask yourself if it could have happened any other way.

4692512,1,B005GP7F34,"Be warned - this program is part of an organized tactic on the part of the media & those who continue to prop up the sole assassin theory. The premise is simple: produce these propaganda pieces in order to indoctrinate the newcomers & ""tourists"" to the JFK assassination case, who just happen to catch the show and have never or are unlikely to read a book on the topic, with the notion that there is little or no real doubt as to whether it was a sole assassin, regardless of whether your thesis is ultimately exposed as a total fraud. That way, these newcomers & ""tourists"" have embedded into their minds that Oswald did in fact do it (which in reality is hotly debated amongst the research community today), and it is only a question of the sequence of events.

With the budget that mainstream media has these days, it is such a shame that the people at Nat Geo back these kinds of productions, and the average viewer simply doesn't know the politics of the producer (Robert Stone) and Max Holland (researcher), as this kind of show is largely trying to transport us back to a 1964 mindset. The way I see it, shows like this one are only designed to make inroads into the lopsided numbers of people that believe there was a conspiracy in the JFK assassination. While this stands at something like 75% of Americans, most polled would only have a rudimentary understanding of the basic parameters of the case, rather than having an above-board knowledge, and in fact probably take their knowledge from the movie JFK. Because of this, these people can be easily influenced by viewing shows like this that seem to push the notion that everything has been solved & we can all go back to sleep now, and many of the younger generation probably have not seen the movie JFK, as it's now an old movie, so won't be influenced by it.

However, a more than cursory look at this kind of documentary highlights exactly how it is quite simply designed to dupe the inexperienced viewer. But, you know there is plenty of snake oil cooking when David Von Pein, one of the main sole assassin theory supporters that blogs on Amazon goes on to debunk the thesis of ""JFK: The Lost Bullet"" in his review. I thoroughly recommend Black Op Radio episode #557, where researcher Jim DiEugenio spends two hours completely deconstructing & debunking this show. So both sides of the JFK research community pretty much dismiss Max Holland's thesis. He also smashes the thesis of TLB on his website, CTKA.

Firstly, Max Holland has been a supporter of the lone assassin theory for nearly twenty years, so he's hardly objective, but if you watch the show, you might get duped into thinking he is. The producer is Robert Stone, who produced the hideous movie ""Oswald's Ghost"", and also the PBS three-part special from the 1990s called ""Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald ?"", which pinned it on Oswald by wheeling out the likes of Priscilla Johnson & Hugh Aynesworth, without going into their history in the case to highlight to the viewer exactly how compromised they are. Even worse, Max Holland's ""independent team of researchers"" features none other than Larry Sturdivan, of which the average viewer will have zero knowledge of, but in fact, he has been a stoic defender of the single bullet/lone assassin theory since his involvement at Edgewood Arsenal, which propped up the Warren Commission findings. To compare it to another paradigm, could you imagine if Himmler was alive today, putting him on an ""independent team"" to investigate whether the holocaust occurred ???

To highlight why all this is important, my manager at my work saw this documentary, and knows that I have read many books on the subject. So she asked me if I had seen this show where ""they proved that the first bullet hit a traffic light"". I rolled my eyes, and said ""oh, you mean that crappy Lost Bullet documentary !"", to which she was shocked, and went on to say that both herself & her husband watched it and thought it was the gospel. She had no idea of who Holland, Stone, and Sturdivan were, so after about five minutes of explaining how anchored to the official case they are, and then going on to attack the thesis of the program (some points as listed below). She realized after this that she had been duped by nothing but slick propaganda.

So what is wrong with the show......here's a few little problems I have identified, and there are probably more out there:

- Holland's narrator actually contends that everyone in the research community believes there were three shots only, but that is where the consensus ends. That is pure nonsense - virtually all conspiracy-orientated researchers do not agree with that at all, most concluding 4-6 shots. I myself agree that there were unlikely more than four audible shots (of which many witnesses did claim), although this doesn't account for shots that were synchronized, or silenced weapons.

- Holland's main thesis is that the first shot happened earlier than the first frame of the Zapruder Film, and that the bullet struck a traffic light on the corner of Elm & Houston Streets. They also supply ""photo evidence"", that is, a photo of the traffic light with a mark on it that is claimed to prove that a bullet struck it. ABSOLUTE NONSENSE - not supported by one single witness, which surely one would have reported hearing the clatter of a bullet hitting the traffic light. Furthermore, if it did, it would have been taken down on day one & would be in the national archives today. Yep, they can't even introduce the traffic light into evidence, but claim it did happen. There is no doubt that if the Warren Commission had this evidence, they would have paraded this around as one of the key pieces of evidence in the case. The mark in the photo could easily portray bird droppings, but Holland claims that this is fresh metal exposed from a bullet strike. He doesn't go on to mention that this bullet would then have to have deflected wildly down Elm Street to hit the curb, causing either fragments or cement to hit bystander James Tague in the face. Holland fails to mention that in order for this to happen, the copper jacket from the bullet would have to be shed, because there was no traces of copper found on the curbstone. He also doesn't bother to mention that Tague stated he was not hit by the first shot - he was hit later in the firing sequence.

- Regarding the charge by Holland that the traffic light was damaged by a bullet strike based on a video clip he shows in TLB, I have my own theory on this, which anyone can check for themselves. Go to your nearest traffic light, and have a look at it. There is generally a light assembly, and a seperate shroud. It is far more reasonable that because no one heard or saw this traffic light damaged, either on the day of the assassination or later, that the traffic light was simply never damaged, and what we are seeing in the footage is a gap between the light assembly & the shroud, with the supposed ""damage"" just being light reflecting off the road's surface & being seen through this gap from where the footage was being filmed. I theorized this by looking at how a light is assembled by visiting the nearest busy intersection, surely Holland might have considered this very thing before he decided to dupe unsuspecting viewers with total guff.

- Holland actually claims that he can see Oswald in the south-east corner of the 6th floor window based on the Hughes film. All I can say is that Holland is eating more carrots than most of us, because I don't know anyone who has ever claimed that they could particularly see Oswald, let alone any identifiable figure in the window. In fact, in the book ""Six Seconds In Dallas"", Josiah Thompson used frames from the Hughes film to try to show that there were two figures in the window. Either way is simply not conclusive, and this attempt by Holland to add further weight to his case borders on comedy.

- Holland uses the Nix film to show that JFK's brain matter ejected to the front, confirming a shot from behind, but fails to explain that this is cavitation, and is not related specifically to the directionality of the shot. In fact, the rearward lurch of the President upon being struck is more indicative of directionality if the rules of momentum conservation apply from a frontal shot. Of course, sole assassin theorists reject this in favour of ""neuromuscular spasm"" for the reason that the President's head went back & left. Sturdivan was right there, yet no one asked him if he is backing NM spasm or jet-effect at that moment, because in his book ""JFK Myths"", he is back on jet-effect to explain it, yet in Reclaiming History, Bugliosi quotes Sturdivan as a NM spasm backer. Questions like how a 6.5mm FMJ bullet would shatter on impact with a skull, or how the autopsy doctors failed to see a wound in the cowlick area of JFK's head, instead placing the wound below the EOP, would actually be more interesting to see the ""independent team of researchers"" answer. For an excellent comparison of what happens when a 6.5mm bullet (in this case, from the Type 30 Japanese Arisaka) is fired into the cowlick area of someone's head, go to the 1:05 minute mark of the following clip from the rape of Nanking, and watch the second Chinese victim's reaction to being shot in the back of the head by Japanese Marines: [...]
- Holland & Sturdivan's explanation of the single bullet theory is pathetic, but it is capable of fooling the viewer who is uninitiated to the JFK case. Getting a guy with a laser pointer on a rifle to line up body doubles of Kennedy & Connally, and having Sturdivan declare the SBT as correct is completely insufficient. A more worthy documentary might have spent the whole 45 minutes on just trying to address the issues with the SBT, and since they had a HD version of the Z-film, perhaps clearing up that JFK was hit at around z190 (as per the HSCA findings), while Connally's reaction is not seen until after z230, and after the so-called ""lapel flip"" at z224, why Connally still turns around like nothing has happened despite supposedly having three wounds (according to the SBT). In fact, the laser pointer did confirm that JFK would have to be leaning anatomically way forward, as Vincent Bugliosi stated in the book ""Reclaiming History"" - even though he is never seen doing this in the Zapruder film at any time that the SBT could have occured, let alone in TLB's recreation.

- By making a replica of the ""sniper nest"", Holland & Co attempt to replicate how the shell casings were placed based on their theoretical firing points. The problem is that the detective who found the spent shells, Luke Mooney, questioned the positioning of the shells in the photograph that Hollland uses when Mooney testified to the Warren Commission. Furthermore, news photographer Tom Alyea confirmed that Captain Fritz of the Dallas PD moved the shells, and Holland & his cronies had to know this, which is just blatantly dishonest documentary making. This makes this entire exercise null & void - even WC defender Dave Reitzes has this on his own website, but I guess Holland happened to miss this fact. Here is a partial quote from Tom Alyea himself....""My statement was that after Capt. Fritz held the casing over the barricade for me to film, he turned to examine the shooting support boxes on the windowsill. I couldn't see the captain put the casings in his coat pocket because his coat pocket was below the top of the barricade. He did not return them to the floor and he did not have them in his hand when he was examining the shooting support boxes. Over thirty minutes later, after the rifle was discovered and the crime lab arrived, Capt. Fritz reached into his pocket and handed the casings to Det. Studebaker to include in the photographs he would take of the sniper's nest crime scene. We stayed at the rifle site to watch Lt. Day dust the rifle. You have seen my footage of this. Studebaker never saw the original placement of the casings so he tossed them on the floor and photographed them.""

- Holland uses Amos Euins as his star witness, who was fourteen years old at the time, and was standing on the corner of Elm & Houston St, as his ear witness to where the shots came from. But he conveniently ignores that Euins testified to the Warren Commission that he heard four shots, not the three that the narrator contends at the start of the program (which in itself would make Euins a dubious witness in a trial with an aggressive lawyer leading the defence). The duration of the firing sequence that Euins explains is also unlike what Holland is trying to portray, because there is less gap between the first & second shot. Euins also couldn't decide if the shooter in the window was a black or white guy. Similarly, the third wounded man, James Tague, makes a brief appearance, yet Holland doesn't bother to ask him if his first bullet thesis fits when Tague was struck in the sequence (which it didn't). You won't find a better opportunity to see if this witness will support your thesis. Instead, they catch a clip of Tague going on about how all the different interpretations of what happened have confused the issue, rather than asking him if their thesis actually fits what happened to Tague on the day !

In fact, the ONLY good thing that can be said about this documentary is that the HD version does well & truly debunked the old nonsense theory that limo driver William Greer turned around & shot JFK with a pistol. This theory was pretty much dead already, but the HD version of the film does confirm it. However, the fact that this was even covered implies that Holland actually regarded this as a leading thesis, yet I cannot even think of a modern day researcher that believed that one anyway.

There are other things wrong with this documentary, but by now the viewer can see that it's really nothing more than a study of how propaganda & irresponsible research still flourishes today. Honest research is actually more palatable to the general public, so when Nat Geo backs superficial programs like this, it speaks volumes in regards to how mired they have become to the mainstream media, which has historically gone out of it's way to suppress the possibility of conspiracy. How Holland & Co ever thought they could slip this nasty product by the JFK research community without it being systematically torn apart is simply baffling.",1337990400,19,14400,4.65082482325216

4692531,1,B005GP7F34,"FIRST OFF, THIS DVD IS CIA DISINFORMATION. This dvd should be noted for what it doesn't mention, not what it does. There is a scene where a laser is used to line up the shot that hit JFK in the back. It goes on to say that the laser also lines up with John Connely's back so the ""single bullet theory""--sorry, make that ""single bullet FRAUD"", is possible. WHAT THEY FAIL TO MENTION IS THAT BULLET WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ENTERED JFK'S BACK COMING DOWN FROM A 6TH FLOOR WINDOW AND EXITED HIS THROAT. THIS IS THE POINT WHERE THE WARREN COMMISSION's FRAUDULANT BALISTICS FALLS APART. A BULLET TRAVELING DOWN IS NOT GOING TO ENTER OVER 5 INCHES DOWN FROM A SHIRT AND JACKET COLLAR AND EXIT A THROAT. NOT EVEN MENTIONING THAT ALL THE DOCTORS AT PARKLAND HOSPITAL SAID JFK'S THROAT WOUND WAS A SMALL PERFECTLY ROUND HOLE--AN ENTRANCE WOUND.
  The dvd also points out that you can see a spray of blood going forward from JFK's head on the Nix film.

It's an introductory look at debunking the JFK assassination conspiracy theory claims. It's beautiful for its HD (on TV) remastering of the historical home videos, but the DVD is NOT HD of course. Also, the videos are presented in piecework; I wish the videos were presented remastered in their wholes as special features. The evidence presented to back up the official theory is basic, but it's very common sense. I wouldn't recommend this if you have your mind set that JFK was not killed by Oswald and Oswald alone because it'll just make you mad. But if you're interested in a little history or want to approach the assassination with an open mind that one man can change the course of history, you should check this out.

4692537,1,B005GP7F34,"Max Holland was the ""star"" and engineer of this film which, after 48 years, still wants us to believe that one of the poorest marksman in the history of the Marine Corps was up to the task of shooting President Kennedy from two different directions (see House Select Committee Report). What's good about this ""documentary"" is that using a budget that probably rivals that of Oliver Stone's who did his research well and told the truth, for ""JFK"" Holland got the Zapruder film and the other 11/22/63 witness' 8mm films digitized using the most expensive and modern technology. Garrison, Lane, Stone and others will go down in history as those who fought against all odds to dig up and present the truth. Holland brings us the latest installment of the Warren Commission apologists' defense of the tired lone assassin theory and Warren Report. ""The Oswald did it"" theory. Now Holland is the theorist and we've all moved on. Leave aside the fact that Oswald almost flunked his Marine marksmanship tests and was a very poor shot, and the fact that Oswald never went to Mexico which Mark Lane has recently revealed in his new book, ""LAST WORD,"" and learn about Holland from Lane as well. Holland tries but fails as these films, particularly the Zapruder film, prove time and time again that the fatal shot that killed President Kennedy really DID come from the Grassy Knoll on the right and to the front of JFK's limousine. The ""Magic Bullet"" is still the ""Magic Bullet"" because the ""Single Bullet Theory"" will never be accepted. Governor Connally was probably the most important witness to that. He knew about rifles and hunting and he wrote a cover story for Life Magazine swearing that he and the President were hit by separate shots. He knew the truth and lived to tell it.",1322006400,12,1772,4.7564935064935066
4692538,3,B005GP7F34,"Robert Stone's new documentary takes a closer look at Max Holland's 2007 notion that Lee Harvey Oswald fired his first shot at JFK just seconds before clothing merchant Abraham Zapruder started his 8mm camera that recorded the famously fatal presidential headshot.

For the first time, fully restored and enhanced hi-def footage from Zapruder's camera and other photographers makes the case that the last two gun shots were closer together than the first two.  Some ear witnesses at the scene agree on this.  But not everyone thinks only three shots were fired.  Some insist four (or more).  And others say three bullets did hit Kennedy.

Although this idea has been debunked by some conspiratorial buffs, a fascinating, but unconvincing case is made for Oswald as the lone assassin in this intriguing film that reveals previously unseen imagery from between the sprockets of Zapruder's film as well as other footage.  It goes so far as to claim that the enlarged emulsion and grainy in the alleged sniper's nest shops Oswald firing his rifle.  Well, I sure didn't see that.

Many questions remain about the pristine ""magic bullet"" that supposedly passed through Kennedy and also wounded Texas Governor John Connally.  But my attention was held by Holland's argument, especially when a laser pointer was aligned from the Texas School Book Depository window (where Oswald was allegedly perched) to Elm Street six flows below where the President's head was blown open on that pivotal November day in Dealey Plaza.

For me, one of the problems regarding the so-called lost bullet is that with all of the incredibly close scrutiny of the assassination site, that first bullet has never been found.  Does it even exist?

Still, a majority of Americans believe this infamous killing to be a cold case of unsolved murder.  In a recent poll, as many as 70 percent of Americans think that Lee Harvey Oswald was innocent or that he didn't act alone.

I really liked hearing from the retired Secret Service agent who participated in the first investigation of the assassination as well as a key eyewitness who hasn't talked publicly about the assassination since the late 1960s.  A bullet wound expert added some interesting observations.

But I am not convinced that Oswald acted alone if at all.

I was in Dallas the day President John Kennedy was murdered. School was dismissed early. That evening I went to the site of Kennedy's death.

Having grown up in the Dallas area, I was very familiar with Dealey Plaza on the edge of downtown Dallas.

But I was not prepared for what I found. As night fell, I recall seeing what appeared to be a nearly full blood-red moon hovering low over the horizon. It was aligned with and in perfect view of the killing zone. On both sides of Elm Street there were -- and still are -- grassy embankments. On the southwesterly side is the famous Grassy Knoll. But on this ominous and unsettling night, both embankments were covered with a solid layer -- layers, no doubt -- of flowers and hand-scribbled notes. They wafted and fluttered in the slight breeze that moved across the city of death. As if in slow motion, people wandered, meandered, cried and stood among the carpet of color. There was no sound but for the sobbing of the mourners. Strangers to each other but bound now by the sadness and shock of mortality, history and mystery.

I'll never forget it.  It's a moment that has yet to be properly defined.  Was it a coup d'tat as many still insist? I heard disturbing stories and theories by those who were there and from those who were in some way connected to the events and persons on that dark day in Dallas.

A friend of mine was working at Parkland Hospital's emergency room that day.  He told me he still sees Jackie Kennedy's freckles floating as if on translucent skin. ""I've never seen anyone as pale since.  It was ghostly,"" he said.

But regarding the main theme of ""The Lost Bullet,"" so many questions about who did it and why still hang heavy in the air.  For instance, it's interesting that the government will not release Oswald's tax forms.  And LBJ's allegedly revealing psychiatric records remain in a vault.  He increasingly spoke about a conspiracy.  Was he getting something off his chest?  It's said that he went mad after he resigned from the job he spent his life trying to get, even refusing to watch the televised moon landing that JFK promised and predicted.  And what about the 2000 or so assassination documents that have not been released.  And the bullet hole that witnesses saw in the FRONT windshield of the presidential limo?  The list goes on and on.

Strangely on that fateful day, Aldous Huxley (BRAVE NEW WORLD) died. So did C.S. Lewis (THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS). And in England, the Beatles released ""TILL THERE WAS YOU."" Coincidences seemingly embedded with meaning?

If this moment in history still interests you, check out this fascinating documentary that focuses on one aspect of a long past noonday moment.  Watch a nightmare conjured as each digital pixel is enlarged and examined for the ghosts of destiny.",1321920000,2,5085,4.829099307159353
4692539,2,B005GP7F34,"Here are some of my random thoughts about the Robert Stone-produced National Geographic documentary, ""JFK: The Lost Bullet"" (this isn't a review of the DVD; it's a review of the program as it aired on the National Geographic Channel on November 20, 2011):

1.) Assassination researcher Max Holland attempted to bolster his ""11 seconds"" shooting timeline with an interesting discovery: A possible bullet hole in a portion of the metal traffic-light frame which hung above Elm Street on 11/22/63 when President Kennedy was assassinated. A ""white spot"" on the traffic light can be clearly seen in a Secret Service re-enactment film from November 27, 1963, just five days after the assassination.

Now, whether that white spot seen on the traffic light was caused by a bullet fired from Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle, no one can say for sure (not even Max Holland). But it is an intriguing discovery nonetheless. Or is it?.....

There's an angle of the ""possible traffic-light defect discovery"" that has me scratching my head:

It turns out that in a written report called ""The DeRonja-Holland Report: Technical Investigation Pertaining To The First Shot Fired In The Kennedy Assassination"", which is a report that appeared online at the ""Washington Decoded"" website on November 20, 2011 (the same day the ""Lost Bullet"" program first aired on television), Max Holland had essentially eliminated the white spot on the traffic light as being a possible bullet hole way back in June of 2011. But Mr. Holland then went ahead and said it possibly WAS a bullet hole on the ""Lost Bullet"" special anyhow. That's a strange situation.

It seems rather disingenuous and dishonest on the part of producer Robert Stone and the other people connected with the production of the ""Lost Bullet"" program to allow Mr. Holland's comments (regardless of when they were put on film) about a possible bullet defect in the traffic light to be aired in the special on 11/20/2011.

I suppose it's possible that the NatGeo producers just couldn't bear to edit out the one thing that was, by far, the biggest ""new"" revelation (or ""bombshell"", if you prefer that word) that came out of the one-hour ""Lost Bullet"" documentary. So, they just let the viewers think that the ""defect"" (white spot) that we see in the traffic light could possibly have been caused by a bullet from Lee Harvey Oswald's gun.

But if that last statement I just made is correct, then if I were Max Holland, I'd be boiling mad and fit to be tied. Because the net result of the ""Lost Bullet"" program (as it aired on November 20th, 2011), plus factoring in the information produced in the ""DeRonja-Holland Report"" (which clearly has Mr. Holland's name on it as a co-author) is this:

A.) There's almost no way in the world that the ""white spot"" that we see on that traffic light (in the 11/27/63 Secret Service film) is the result of a bullet.

B.) Max Holland, five months before the ""Lost Bullet"" special aired, knew full well that Point A above is true.

C.) The National Geographic Channel went ahead and aired Holland's opinion anyway that the white spot could still be a bullet defect in the traffic light.

Any way you slice it, there's a bad odor coming from this whole ""traffic light"" situation, in my opinion.

Perhaps, however, there's something about this whole thing that I'm missing. But based on the NatGeo special (as it aired), in conjunction with the Technical Report with Mr. Holland's name on it, I'm not quite sure what that missing ""something"" might be.

Perhaps Max Holland still thinks that the white spot on the traffic light IS, indeed, a bullet defect--even AFTER he saw for himself, in June 2011, the same type of traffic light which has a ""gap"" in its metal structure to account for what looks like a hole or defect. I just don't know.

~shrug~

2.) Via laser beam technology, the ""Lost Bullet"" researchers re-staged the Single-Bullet Theory. The laser-beam ""shooter"" wasn't on the sixth floor of the Book Depository exactly (because the sixth-floor corner window has been closed off for years), but instead was perched outside the sniper's window on a crane or cherry-picker device that hoisted him six floors above Elm Street. His ""shot"" lined up (generally) with the SBT shot.

It would have been nice, however, to see some more details of this ""SBT"" part of the program, which was very brief, and only showed the ""victims"" (the stand-ins for JFK and Connally) in tight close-ups, and I really couldn't tell if the men were lined up correctly in the car; and I couldn't really tell whether they had Connally turned far enough to his right. And there was no indication of where the ""laser shot"" would have exited on JFK's body. So this segment, while okay, could have been better, IMO.

3.) Some assassination figures who haven't been seen in decades turned up for the ""Lost Bullet"" filming in Dealey Plaza, including 63-year-old Amos Euins, who was a key witness on 11/22/63, as he actually got a look at the gunman on the sixth floor of the Depository, and he saw the rifle in the window, which Euins said resembled a ""pipe"" to him. It's good to see Amos again. And, boy, he looks great at age 63 too. I'd swear he was in his 40s or early 50s.

But there's something strange going on with Mr. Euins' comments in ""The Lost Bullet"", too. Euins told the Warren Commission in 1964 that he heard ""four [shots], to be exact"" (WC Volume 2; Page 204). But it would seem that now, in 2011, Euins has switched to being a ""3 Shots"" witness. Strange indeed. So, take much of this program's content with a large grain of salt by your side.

Former Secret Service agent John J. Howlett and Dealey Plaza witnesses Tina Towner and James Tague also made appearances. And Max Holland & Company definitely want America to believe that Tague was wounded by Oswald's FIRST shot, although Tague (at least prior to 2011) always maintained he wasn't stung in the face by the first bullet. He always said it was a later shot that struck him.

Wound ballistics investigator and author Larry M. Sturdivan also appeared in the program. Sturdivan wrote one of my favorite books on the John F. Kennedy assassination,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-JFK-Myths/dp/1557788472/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The JFK Myths""</a>, which came out in 2005.

4.) A detailed digital restoration of several of the assassination films was done for the program, including the films taken by Abraham Zapruder, Robert Hughes, Orville Nix, Tina Towner, Mark Bell, and Elsie Dorman.

And while the restoration of the films was nice to see (albeit in very choppy, interrupted segments--a few seconds here, then a few seconds there), I can't really see where it actually aided Mr. Holland's cause in coming to his unique conclusion that Oswald's first (missed) shot struck the traffic light PRIOR to Zapruder frame 133 (i.e., prior to the time when Zapruder resumed filming the motorcade after briefly stopping his camera).

In fact, the film that helped Holland by far the most wasn't an ""assassination"" film at all. It was, instead, the previously-mentioned film taken by the U.S. Secret Service on November 27, 1963, during a filmed reconstruction of the shooting in Dealey Plaza (the film which shows the white spot on the traffic light structure at the corner of Elm and Houston Streets).

5.) A pretty large mistake was made by the narrator near the start of the 1-hour ""Lost Bullet"" show (or it could have been an outright lie), when he said that both lone-assassin believers and conspiracists alike agree on the fact that just TWO bullets struck President Kennedy and just ONE bullet struck Governor Connally.

I don't know where the ""Lost Bullet"" script writers got their information, but as most students of the assassination know, there are many conspiracy theorists who believe that JFK was struck by more than just two bullets on November 22, 1963.

In fact, from my online experience, the vast majority of conspiracy theorists who participate regularly in Internet discussions firmly believe that a MINIMUM of three shots struck JFK's body; and many of those conspiracists also think Governor Connally was hit at least twice. (And if you happen to be in league with Professor James H. Fetzer, then you believe that a total of SEVEN bullets struck the two victims -- 4 bullets hit Kennedy and 3 hit Connally -- which is, of course, an absolutely absurd scenario.)

6.) The ""Lost Bullet"" producers tried to pass off an audio clip of NBC's Tom Pettit describing the shooting of Oswald as actually being a description of the frenzied scene in Dealey Plaza after JFK was shot. An interesting piece of deception there. No big deal, of course. But it certainly wasn't accurate.

Overall, I think ""JFK: The Lost Bullet"" was just a ""so-so"" documentary. In fact, it was probably even a little worse than ""so-so"" as far as these kind of JFK specials are concerned (even though I agree with Max Holland's ""lone gunman"" conclusion).

The restored film clips were nice to see, especially the Dorman and Towner films, which looked really crisp and sharp. But it didn't look to me like the Zapruder Film was any clearer or sharper than the 1998 MPI restored digital copy that I own, or the stabilized version that I have on one of my webpages.

And the laser-beam test that was done from the approximate (but not exact) position of where Lee Harvey Oswald was firing from was also fairly good, but, as mentioned, I would have liked to see some more details of that laser test, particularly from a variety of camera angles, in order to confirm the correct alignment of the two victims (especially an overhead angle, which WAS an angle that was used during another part of the documentary, but was not used during the ""laser beam"" segment).

I can hear the conspiracy theorists' complaints about that SBT laser test now -- ""They didn't have the angles right at all!"" -- ""The wounds are in the wrong places altogether!"" -- ""They didn't fire any REAL bullets into the stand-ins for Kennedy and Connally!"" -- ""They didn't even go INTO the building to do the test! They were perched on a crane OUTSIDE the sixth floor! So this test is worthless!"" -- Etc., etc.

PARTING THOUGHTS:

Max Holland's ""11 seconds"" and ""Traffic Light"" theories could possibly be accurate. Nobody can know with 100% certainty, of course. And since Max is attempting to fill in a gap concerning the shot that MISSED the limousine's occupants, it becomes a very difficult (if not impossible) task to really ""prove"" anything beyond all reasonable doubt regarding the timing of Oswald's first shot and what happened to that bullet after it left LHO's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.

Holland didn't address the problem that his theory has with respect to one very important timing issue -- that being: John Connally's ""timing"" of that first shot.

Like Mr. Holland, I too believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of President John Kennedy, but ""JFK: The Lost Bullet"" doesn't really bring anything new or extraordinary to the table that wasn't already known prior to 2011. Nor does this program really do very much to reinforce the idea that Oswald was the lone killer of America's 35th President. And some portions of ""The Lost Bullet"" seem to me to be just downright deceptive.

The first JFK hit penetrated his back to a shallow depth(autopsy doctors stated this) But they failed to say they removed a ""missle""(sic). Clearly the FBI was in the possession of a ""missle""(sic) that may not have come from Oswald's rifle. The FBI didn't present this evidence(as far as we know)to the 2 federal probes of JFK's death. We can guess why: the ""missle""(sic) didn't come from Oswald's gun! Secondly, the bullet that hit Gov. JC made body movements(seen in the Zapruder film)that show that Gov.
