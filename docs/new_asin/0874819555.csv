7793257,5,0874819555,"The DVD is actually two lectures. They are both incredible lectures by a person who speaks with a voice of authority and experience. Unlike many of the teachers of today, the swami speaks with conviction and humility.

The lectures cover the major points of the Yoga Aphorisms of Patanjali, one of the major scriptures of India, and a popular scripture in the USA for yoga students. The stress is on the philosophy, not yoga postures. It is smart,clear, and anticipates the questions of the viewer. Highly recommended. I also suggest the companion book How to Know God: The Yoga Aphorisms of Patanjali, also available from Amazon.",1194048000,3,630,4.943396226415095
