6474146,5,B00L89VLZU,"I remember Sunday afternoons when my whole family were taking naps except for me, and this show would be on. What a great show, I did not realize that they only had 13 episodes and it ran for only one season. Amazon has done a great job releasing this show. Even in today's world of streaming I still prefer DVDs because I actually own the content. This release, I hope, will send a clear message that we want some of the other Nick shows released, Salute Your Shorts, Secret World of Alex Mack, Welcome Freshmen and many more. I especially hope that they release Salute Your Shorts there are some on Amazon instant but no DVD.",1405555200,11,627,4.413793103448276

6474152,5,B00L89VLZU,I remember watching My Brother and Me on weekends for years. It wasn't until I got older that I realized that it only ran for 13 episodes.

6474154,5,B00L89VLZU,"I always loved this show as a kid, and could relate to it so well as having siblings in a ""Middle Class"" family during the 90's. This show captures the very essence of the mid-90's so well, and it's so great seeing all of the retro clothing, sneakers, and sports memorabilia all throughout the series. I swear this show elevated the popularity of the Charlotte Hornets, even where I grew up in Phoenix when the Phoenix Suns were incredibly popular during this time too.",1483315200,,469,4.595238095238095

6474163,5,B00L89VLZU,"I loved this show as a youth, it was great to see people who looked like me on my favorite network along with other great shows.  For years I've been wanting to see these episodes replayed on some ""Flashback Friday"" type segment on Nickelodeon.  Unfortunately that never happened but I am grateful that the episodes released on dvd.  The only bad part is that the show only lasted for one season which is a downer once they're over but still great to know that I can see the show whenever I wanted.  I've even got my 8 year old niece hooked on the show, the show will forever be a favorite.",1459987200,,590,4.288288288288288

6474177,5,B00L89VLZU,"My Brother and Me was an underrated show of the 90's. I enjoyed pretty much everything  Nickoldeon produced from Doug, The Rugrats to Are You Afraid of the Dark. This show had moments that stood out to me from ""Goo Punch"" to ""Hit me, Hit me""! Had to buy it",1441497600,2,256,4.12

6474181,4,B00L89VLZU,"I watched this all the time when the show was on as a kid and I haven't seen it since then. Bought the DVD (didn't realize it only lasted 13 episodes). This show was basically Nickelodeon's attempt at a straight-up family sitcom. Looking back at it now it really wasn't that funny or original, but it is a very cute show that had a lot of charm. I loved it as a kid, and I still think it holds up pretty good as an adult.",1435622400,4,421,3.9647058823529413
6474182,4,B00L89VLZU,"Just like everyone else, I LOVED my brother and me growing up, and I know I still would to this day. The ONLY reason why I have not ordered this is because I've had the displeasure of dealing with Arthur Reggie personally and he is a rude arrogant jerk..Like seriously, It hurt me to know that the real ""Alfie"" is less than favorable...This is a good show but I refuse to put money in Arthurs pocket....he does not deserve it..I will just have to leave the memory of this show frozen in time. :-(",1434326400,,496,4.287234042553192

6474185,5,B00L89VLZU,"I admit that I was an adult when I was watching this great series back in the 90's.  Nevertheless, I found it cool then and I still find it cool today.  Hence, I am grateful for whatever powers-at-be were responsible for producing this fun and valuable DVD set.
My Brother and Me didn't attempt to force any deep and heavy moral issues...as some other kids programs often do.  The messages, if any, are  right there in the stories and they are brought across with great comedy and wonderful performances by all of the young actors.  The kids are just kids.  Yes, they are (mostly) black and yes, the family is middle class.  Yes, believe it or not, there are multiple thousands of kids in America who are just like Dee-Dee, Alfie and Goo.
If you have young kids, and you're unfamiliar with My Brother and Me, I strongly recommend this for your children.  They will both laugh and learn.",1428019200,2,886,4.528301886792453

6474187,5,B00L89VLZU,Never thought i would get this on dvd I grew up on this....i am very pleased and it came on time!!!!,1426377600,,100,3.8095238095238093
6474188,5,B00L89VLZU,"So glad to have My Brother and Me available on DVD finally. I hope Amazon is able to do this with other classic Nick series soon. I see that they now have true season sets of Are You Afraid of the Dark, thankfully! I also ordered season one of it. More series I would love to see: Salute Your Shorts, please?! I would even like to see some of the sports shows that used to be on GaS, like Double Dare, Finders Keepers, GUTS, Legends of the Hidden Temple and Nick Arcade. Most of all I'd love to see Eureeka's Castle, The Noozles, Adventures of the Little Koala or especially Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics brought to DVD through manufacture-on-demand. You'd think if they had the rights to the shows back then they could somehow work out a deal. Make it so, Viacom!!

Of course I'm an adult now and some of this is pretty goofy stuff, but my daughter liked it and all the classic lines were still hilarious. The humor and morals still hold up and the situations still apply to kids of today. It's nice to be able to see the episodes in clearer quality than back when they were aired. For the most part the picture stays clear as a bell, but every so often there is some interlacing or something that pops up in the video. It doesn't happen often enough for me to complain about it though, so I wouldn't worry about it.

The DVD video quality is definitely a huge step up from the VHS rips on Youtube and torrent sites. The packaging is well done- standard DVD release fare, although somewhat oddly devoid of stills or cast photos. I would definitely recommend this set to friends or even re-purchase this DVD set(or any others to be released from the series I stated above) if I happened to lose or break them.

Overall, I say well played, Viacom and Amazon. You're doing something right for longtime fans of 90s Nickelodeon.",1426118400,3,1822,4.416666666666667

6474193,5,B00L89VLZU,"I kind of stumbled on to this DVD release from checking for it on YouTube. The episodes that were uploaded looked a little bit TOO clear for your average footage from the 90s, so i checked Amazon for the hell of it. YES!!!!! So I ordered 2 copies. 1. To hold on to as memorabilia due to the fact that ONLY Amazon has this show on DVD for sell. 2. Because knowing Nick, and not to mention the fact this was an historic show of the network as it's first show with an all Black cast[except Harry] 3. I believe once they're gone, they're gone for good. 4. My kids instantly loved this show, ages 2 and 5, we can all sit down and watch together and not have to worry about language, content, racism. The jokes are still current and funny (slang may be a little outdated today). Like most reviewers, I haven't watched this show since the show came out when I was an early teen, I also didn't realize this show only lasted 1 season. And finally- 5. After reading reviews, I also bought a second copy due to the cheap format Nick released these episodes on and the fact that they can scratch easily.",1422316800,,1091,4.25
6474194,1,B00L89VLZU,I LOVE THE SHOW!!!! My review is not bad because of that. But is anyone else receiving a disc that is constantly skipping. I have ordered twice now and this is the 3rd time just because I do not want to give up hope...but its not working for me.,1421366400,,245,4.020408163265306

6474198,5,B00L89VLZU,So glad Amazon finally got this show out on DVD! Very cute short lived Nickelodeon show! I didn't think it was ever going to be available. I loved this blast from the past! I was so excited watching it that I almost went out and got me a Cool Dr. Money haircut.,1419292800,,261,4.038461538461538

6474201,5,B00L89VLZU,"This DVD set is for all the episodes in the entire series. There weren't many episodes but this show is just as good as I remember when I used to watch it as a kid. The weird thing is that this show is still fun to watch. I was afraid that sometimes when you grow up and watch a movie or show that you enjoyed as a kid, its not the same anymore. Not the case with this one. This show is still great and you really should buy it. The quality is pretty darn good too. Of course not HD or anything because that was not out yet back then but just as good as it was back then as it is now.",1417910400,2,584,3.717741935483871

6474205,5,B00L89VLZU,"Just got it in the mail, I love it. Used to watch this show when it was new and it was a favorite of mine. I was 5 and in kindergarten. Episodes are nice, clear quality--much better than the blurry VHS copies that have been on Youtube for years but for awhile I figured it would be all we had, until I learned it was getting released on dvd. Back in 1995, I didn't realize it got cancelled after just 13 episodes and I kept thinking, why do they keep running the same episodes over and over? It wasn't until years later that I found out it got cancelled due to disagreements with the producers/writers. And another thing I saw on this set, the episodes must be in production order because they're out of order. And they are different titles than normal so I was like ""there's no episode called Nobody's Baby!"". I was able to identify which each episode is.

Disc 1
Dee Dees Girlfriend (aka Partners) (12-15-94)
Donnells birthday party (aka Dance) (1-5-95)

Dee Dee runs away (aka Nobody's Baby) (12-28-94)
The Bully (2-2-95)

6474211,5,B00L89VLZU,This is one of my favorite shows from my childhood that nobody else I know seems to remember haha. I was IN LOVE with Alfie as a kid and watched this show all the time. I had no idea it was released on DVD and really just stumbled on it while looking for something else on Amazon. This was such a pleasant surprise and I bought it immediately without thinking twice! It was no surprise to me that I still had every episode still memorized lol. It's great to re-live the nostalgia of the show and just enjoy a simpler time of tv where everything/everyone was super cheesy but it was good fun tv. I'm so glad Nickelodeon released this. I can only hope other shows from this time period will be released on DVD soon. I've got to show my kids what good tv was someday! :),1409616000,,767,4.1891891891891895

Hit Me!"" and he got pushed in the mud, and another one where Dee Dee got a cool doctor money haircut, too bad it only lasted one season but this was back when Nickelodeon was real good it didn't matter how long shows lasted back then because everything that was on Nick at the time was cool to me, but you really should buy this complete series of a classic African America sitcom from Nickelodeon!",1406332800,,567,4.071428571428571
