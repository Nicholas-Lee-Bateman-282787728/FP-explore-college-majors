2639392,3,B000HLDDCY,"For those who have not read 'Rise and Fall of the Third Reich', this film offers some insights into the establishment of 'The Final Solution'. It should be a precursor to The Holocaust series of dvd's offered by Amazon.

Though some of the statements made seem self-servient, they expose the roots of the most hellish treatment ever to visit a race of peoples.",1183334400,5,360,4.714285714285714
2639393,4,B000HLDDCY,"The banality of evil is a good way to describe this movie. It is a reconstructed dialogue based on events and every attempt seems to have been made to give the characters some life. It was impossible for Heydrich to have a lazy eye, as he did in real life, so those little things couldn't be brought into the production. However the broad power plays and a recognition of 'illegality' could be portrayed.",1179014400,6,404,4.5479452054794525
2639394,2,B000HLDDCY,This an excellent documentary but the sound quality of the commentary was very poor. How can I get it exchanged?,1379203200,,112,4.65
2639395,2,B000HLDDCY,The trouble is the sound mixing. The heinous soundtrack of supposedly ominous music drowns out the narrative. It is very hard to ascertain the actual content. What a shoddy amateurish job.,1362528000,,188,5.096774193548387
2639396,2,B000HLDDCY,"Like most others commenting here, I thought this was the 1984 German film of the actual conference.  It isn't. It's a very general documentary about the Jewish situation in Europe during the time leading up to the conference and while I enjoy a good documentary, this one is too general for my tastes.  I have virtually all of the information here in other formats, making this redundant.  Pity.",1301961600,11,395,4.779411764705882
2639397,5,B000HLDDCY,"It is so very difficult to give dedicated, considered thought to such an undertaking such as the WANNSEE CONFERENCE without one's  mind mobilizing restraints and creating diversions.  But it must be done as well as HUMANLY possible; IT happened and IT happened in one of EUROPE'S most cultured and educated Countries; the Land of Great Composers, Philosophers, Mathematicians, Physicists, Doctors, Successful Merchants, Distinguished Professors of every imaginable subject at Distinguished Universities, Clergy of all Christian denominations and on, and on, and on....., IT happened!  THE HORROR OF HORRORS; the very essence of the phrase: ""MAN'S INHUMANITY TO MAN""...., .. IT COULD NOT CONCEIVABLY HAVE BEEN WORSE, we tell ourselves, NEVER AGAIN,-- BUT we have seen 'shades' of it in other places since.... albeit on a much lesser scale but no less horrific.

This ALMOST so innocent sounding name, the WANNSEE CONFERENCE, so evil was the euphemistic title given to a conspirancey antithetical to the very essence of what constitutes a civilized human soul and being with but the least of conscience say nothing of those with well-defined conscience as those listed above, who should have served, with their lives if need demanded, as the bulwark of opposition against these undisguised evil monsters.

A transcript of the precisely 85 minute Conference resides with the NUREMBURG TRIAL PROCEEDINGS but detailed summaries are available along with the list of attendees, led by the Head of Hitler's SS (Secret Service) Reinhard HEYDRICH WHO CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE AND CHARGED EACH ATTENDEE WITH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS AND DUTIES..... for THE FINAL SOLUTION OF THE JEWISH PROBLEM IN ALL OF EUROPE.  This ""ptoblem"" involved the planned literal, ruthless murder in the most grotesque manner of over 11,000,000 Jewish women children, babies and men.  This material MUST be read by every human being on the face of G-D'S EARTH.  This is a blemish on the soul of humanity.  How such can ever be purged is beyond my intellectual capacity to discern.  Reading of this CONFERENCE is but a feeble start and delving deeper will test one's moral strength and Eternal Soul.",1294531200,2,2158,5.283625730994152
2639398,3,B000HLDDCY,"Sorry to say, this was a grossly misleading offer.  ""The Wannsee Conference"" is the name of a 1984 German-made film, recreating the actual conference from notes taken by a secretary at the meeting.  This VHS tape, though identically titled, was (from what I could gather) a discussion about the conference rather than a re-enactment of the conference itself.  I think it should have been more accurately titled so as to avoid confusion with the film of the same name.",1264809600,39,467,4.886075949367089
2639399,5,B000HLDDCY,"This was made in Germany, subtitled, and remade with Kenneth Branaugh with title of Conspiracy. That this was made in Germany, is amazing reflection of a willingness to look into the dark side of Nazi Germany High Command, the cold decision made by  group dedicated to The Final Solution, over lunch. Chilling and expertly done.",1219708800,,328,4.963636363636364
2639400,2,B000HLDDCY,"A mix of historical footage, interviews, and narration. I say it is not quite as described because almost 30 minutes of the 51 minutes running time describes the situation of the Jews in Nazi Germany prior to the conference, leaving only 20 minutes for the conference itself. I think anyone who would buy this video knows most of this information, and wants information about the conference and what happened there. There was very little in the way of details in that regard. The production values were also slightly below average, with the audio of the narrator's voice being drowned out by the music.  It was also made before the Wannsee villa became a museum and learning center, so it is a little dated in that regard. Production date: 1992.",1206921600,41,745,4.775193798449612
2639401,5,B000HLDDCY,"To avoid atrocities, the mankind should never forget what has happened once, to prevail what might happen again.",1206662400,,112,5.277777777777778
2639402,1,B000HLDDCY,"Another reviewer (Tracy) summed up the issues with this DVD quite well and thus I would have to agree with her remarks. Little of the film is about the Wannsee Conference, most of it is 101-level history, and - very annoyingly - the audio is all messed up: the narrator can hardly be heard over the ""background"" music. Just a sloppily done effort that is a waste of money.",1201478400,21,372,4.405797101449275
2639403,5,B000HLDDCY,The movie presents the facts (and nothing but the facts) of that fateful conference. You have to speak German fluently to catch the nuances of the language used.,1186185600,3,161,4.785714285714286
8140498,5,B000HLDDCY,Very insightful. A must see for all.,1458518400,,36,4.285714285714286
8140499,1,B000HLDDCY,"This documentary is, hands down, the absolutely worse film I've ever seen in my entire life, and that includes every public information reel-to-reel flick I've ever slept my way through in high school.  While watching it I sometimes suspected the whole thing was a scam cooked up in someone's garage.  No offense to the seller - they did their job, but they would do well to do us all a favor and remove every copy they have of this creature and convey it to the local landfill.

There were a multitude of repetitious KNOWN facts that anyone could dig up from the encyclopedia, and interviews of obscure people who proffered personal opinions that were unhelpful or misleading rather than insightful, accompanied by grainy stills.  The most revolting feature of all was the hysterically incoherent subtitling at the bottom of the screen - impossible to glean anything of value, and a total waste of time to even attempt to read it.  Why, oh why did they do it?",1454889600,,960,4.724550898203593
8140500,4,B000HLDDCY,This is sad but unfortunately the world we live in. Even still so today.,1453075200,,72,4.214285714285714

8140502,5,B000HLDDCY,In a word wow!  Everybody should see this dvd,1433980800,,45,4.0
8140503,1,B000HLDDCY,"All this was was a movie about Hitler's rise to power. The Wannsee conference was hardly really mention. 15 men were at this conference and only three of them were mentioned. It briefly showed a very quick list of who was there.  if you're buying is to watch it for its historical value, don't.",1425340800,6,294,4.444444444444445
8140504,5,B000HLDDCY,very chilling dvd,1424304000,,17,5.0
8140505,5,B000HLDDCY,"A troubling, but illuminating look at the infamous gathering of top-level Nazis calmly discussing the dreadful ""final solution of the Jewish problem."" Great attention to detail -- including the setting at a stately building in Wannsee, near Berlin.",1414713600,2,248,5.552631578947368
8140506,4,B000HLDDCY,"Exceptionally fascinating. . .

My understanding is that this is a dramatization of the historical conference in which Himmler got the enthusiastic approbation (except for two more reserved reaction to the genocide.

The casting is superlative and the movie is a must-see for thoughtful students of life and human nature.",1392076800,,321,5.4
8140507,5,B000HLDDCY,"A documentary concerning where IT all began.  The implementation plan for Hitler's ""Final Solution to the Jewish Question"" was formed during the conference.  Ostensibly a secret meeting with no documentation meant to survive, one copy of the conference report was preserved.  A subsequent TV movie, ""Conspiracy,"" was based on the report.

If you have any interest in films showing how the Holocaust came about, this is a good place to start.",1386720000,,441,5.169014084507042
