2559905,5,B000FBFZ2C,"This is a must see for the Police afficianado. If you like the television series ""Cops"" you'll love this. This was filmed in NYC in 1976. There are no scripts and its the real deal.",1173484800,2,181,4.2
2559906,4,B000FBFZ2C,"The ""Police Tapes"" was one of the first of its kind 'reality show,' which focused on the New York City Police Department in the Bronx, in the then-notorious 44th Precinct.  It was done duing the 1970s in the South Bronx, in a police precinct that was not as well-known as the infamous 41st Precinct ""Fort Apache,""  which was about two miles to the east of the 44 Precinct, but was suffering from the same human degradation as the 41 Precinct and the rest of the so-called South Bronx.

The Bronx Borough Commander at that time was Chief Tony Bouza, who was known for his articulate explanation of the 'theater of the absured' which was the Bronx. In his dialogue on the tape, Bouza attempts to put into real terms the issues which are affecting the Bronx...and the cops themselves...at that time, to the point where he says that maybe he shouldn't do such a good job, in order to let the problems be more exposed to the rest of the country.

This was to become one of the first of what was several TV shows and documentaries about the ""South Bronx,"" which became a ""city"" forced to wallow in its own misery for years after the Police Tapes were made, despite its notoriety and the promises of many politicians.

The lack of 21st Century video technology shows, but enhances what you see.

Nothing like what was the ""South Bronx"" will ever happen again.",1154908800,12,1352,4.54320987654321
8120397,5,B000FBFZ2C,"This was the ""COPS"" shop before the more famous ""COPS"" show. The analisys of the crime in N Y at the end by Chief Bouza is very interesting and worth the purchase price alone. The interview with the filmmakers is also very good.",1500681600,,228,4.325581395348837
8120398,5,B000FBFZ2C,The most surprising and amazing component of this film is Commander Tony Bouza. His insight and intellect is off the charts and he is brutally honest. He is able to understand what happens emotionally and psychologically to police officers while at the same time himself not losing his sense of humanity towards the impoverished and dispossessed community he serves. His words are as applicable today as they were forty years and I wish we had listened back then.,1496620800,,463,4.948717948717949
8120399,5,B000FBFZ2C,As poignant today as it was when it was made. A must for any outsider who wants to try to understand Ghetto life as it was.,1474675200,,123,3.769230769230769
8120400,5,B000FBFZ2C,"brilliant but so sad when you think that those gangs now carry guns not pipes, and alcohol has been replaced by drugs. I showed it to my very upper middle class college students who were stunned and, best of all, informed. I doubt very much if the police would now be open to such a candid documentary. Bravo for the Raymonds!",1459209600,,326,4.360655737704918
8120401,5,B000FBFZ2C,"The Police Tapes leaves me wanting to see more - footage from this era is difficult to come by, and what is present on the DVD is fantastic.  If you're curious about this era of NYC/policing, you can't go wrong with this one.",1458950400,,225,4.232558139534884
8120402,5,B000FBFZ2C,"Excellent eye opener. Brings back memories watching my old neighborhoods going to hell. Many of the conditions & problems from 40 years ago are present now. It is NOT a stretch to say we could end up with similar results today if our elected leaders and uninvolved parents continue to let down our children and abandon their responsibilities. The more things change, the more they stay the same.",1455580800,,395,4.823529411764706
8120403,5,B000FBFZ2C,"My dad James Carroll passed away Sunday, February 24th.  He is on the cover of The Police Tapes jacket.  I watched this as a child when it first was shown on TV and grew up listening to the horrors that my dad worked through in the 44.  He loved his job and helping as much as he could.  It is an eye opener to now watch this as an adult.  An honor to a great man, doing something he loved to do. RIP dad we love you.",1362268800,2,417,3.7471264367816093
8120404,5,B000FBFZ2C,"Want to know what police work was really like in the South Bronx in the 1970's? This is the video for you! What's ironic is that while the buildings change, people's emotions do not. Cops today face the same trials and tribulations as yester year! Buy the video, and enjoy the video!",1259539200,2,283,4.461538461538462
8120405,4,B000FBFZ2C,"Starting from 1970, and going until ~ 1996, New York City slid into lawlessness and decay, and there was no better emblem of that process than the South Bronx. By 1976 the area came to define `The Ghetto' of modern times, and its 44th precinct station house was known as `Fort Apache' and mythologized in the 1981 feature film of that name.

As they reveal in a present-day interview included in the DVD, in 1976 the documentary film-making team of Allan and Susan Raymond got access to a newfangled, portable Sony video camera that recorded onto tape. While the camera weighed only a pound, the tape deck weighed close to 20 lb and had to be carried by a second person. The Raymonds decided that filming police work would be inherently dramatic, and they chose the 44th precinct as their subject, although, as Susan Raymond explains, the real topic of the documentary is not so much the police, but the South Bronx.

In grainy, low-lit footage we see `real' policing in all its squalid glory: breaking up fights between drunk and stoned residents; apprehending car thieves made psychotic by PCP; answering domestic disturbance calls (banging open a locked door is much more laborious and protracted than the `one-kick-it's-open' scenarios from movies and TV cop shows).

There is depressing footage of homicide victims, and folks from the `hood mugging and showboating for the camera, even as bereaved relatives shriek and wail in the background. There's nothing uplifting or noble about what goes on in the South Bronx, just blacks preying on other blacks and Puerto Ricans, and Ricans in turn preying on other Ricans and blacks. The (mostly white) cops of the 44th precinct are quite cynical about their daily duties amid the human wreckage.

It's left to their commander, Tony Bouza, to look at the camera and launch into standard-issue pop-sociology lectures about neglect, poverty, and violence, and the cancer in the body of America that the South Bronx represents.

`The Police Tapes' is an interesting look at New York City in all its seedy 70s glory and a reminder that the Ghetto Carnage that reigns today in cities like New Orleans, Baltimore, Detroit, and Buffalo is by no means something uniquely fostered by the advent of crack cocaine in the early 80s. Indeed, from the days of the Dead Rabbits and the massive gang wars of the early 19th century, on up to the South Bronx of the 70s, crime and violence were (and are) an integral part of urban life in the US. `The Police Tapes' let you experience it in the comfort of your living room !",1247961600,3,2554,4.795454545454546
8120406,5,B000FBFZ2C,"I did South Bronx cop patrol in many commands including the 44 so know the so accuracy of The Police Tapes. Did three gunbattles 1969-70 46 Command and got a Japanese bayonet souvenir off a wild gun run in 44 where we kicked in a apartment door. Al Aaronson the great Daily News crime photograper was snapping us as we kicked in the door. So wow yes "" The Police Tapes "" is so vivid accurate. Viewing it literaly felt I was back on South Bronx patrol emotionally. The Police Tapes will be a true eye opener for lay folk but us South Bronx cops we only knew we wanted action and we found it.
