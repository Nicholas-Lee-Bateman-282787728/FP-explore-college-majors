7877543,4,6304783280,"I love anything to do with modern aviation and especially when it has more of an upclose and personal point of view such as Red Arrows - Rolling in the Sky.  The makers of this video did an outstanding job when it was first made in 1990 when the Reds were in Cyprus to practise their 1991 display.  The addition of the tail and cockpit mounted cameras give a view that is otherwise unobtainable by conventional filming.  If I have one criticism about this dvd edition is that two or three music tracks differ from the original VHS edition form the early ninties and the addition of the black and white profiling section at the start.  The initial commentary gives you enough statistics on the Hawk already so why do it again and as mentioned the new music track doesn't do the sections the play on any favour.
Whilst in some ways I do prefer the original VHS issue with the full commentary from then Team Manager Sqn Ldr Andy Stewart, I like the fact that the dvd edition is the exact same footage but without any commentary and is just for pure visual pleasure.  The makers of the music itself I thing did a great job with the majority of the music especially during the synchro pair and taxi in sequences.  When it comes to aviation footage, music can either deter the viewer or emit an emotion and I think that Red Arrows - Rolling in the Sky emits and emotion of ""I wish I was there"" and ""Wouldn't that be cool to do that"" kind of feeling.
I thoroughly recommend this dvd edition on two levels.  If you have an interest in aviation on both the technical and just for the love of it then it is perfect.  Even if you are not a massive aviation enthusiast but have slight interest, the visual impact from all angles throughout the presentation is still well worth it.",1308009600,,1768,4.385321100917431
7877544,4,6304783280,I am a hobbyist air show photographer and I really enjoyed this movie.  As someone else commented upon the music was a little destracting and I would rather have just listened to the radio calls and the Adour engines.  My best advice is just sit back with a drink and enjoy the visuals.,1123372800,,286,4.377358490566038
7877545,3,6304783280,The approach taken is purely visual and lacks the impact of the TV documentaries shown in the UK. In the end I was left with a feeling of an incomplete telling. The music detracts from the action by competing for attention. A lot of time the heavy breathing of the pilots and the laconic commands are a lot more dramatic than the music. I wonder if that was done to avoid the need for translation for other markets?,1033084800,,415,4.333333333333333
7877546,4,6304783280,At last an acrobatics video that shows you all the moves! My Uncle was in the Red Arrows in the 70's and I will definately give him the chance to see it! What a trip.,961459200,4,166,3.7714285714285714
