2572698,5,B000FL7C8C,"It breaks my heart the series ended after two years. After you watch it you'll be sad, too. I've never been so hooked and so inspired by an HBO series before. Definately made for the alternative thinker.",1223078400,3,203,4.513513513513513
2572699,5,B000FL7C8C,We loved this series and were left wanting more.  There were only 2 seasons so we are left with unanswered questions forever.  The characters were interesting and well developed.  The 1930's backdrop was excellent.,1211846400,,214,5.235294117647059
2572700,5,B000FL7C8C,I had forgotten just how amazing this HBO offering was ... enjoying it more than I can say the second time around.,1209859200,,114,4.2272727272727275
2572701,1,B000FL7C8C,"I got sucked into this series, despite the facile writing, the often cringe-worthy dialogue and the painfully obvious fact that many -- thank god not all -- of the castmembers couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag (or they were directed and edited so badly that they were unable to show any talent). Through it all, I gave the writers credit that something more was going on below the veneer of arbitrary spookiness and inscrutability. The ending told me that I had been a sucker.
Give a high school drama club a $50 million budget for costumes, sets and cgi, tell them to do something spooky and atmospheric, and you'd get something like this. Oh, and throw in a few really talented actors to highlight how bad everyone else is.
The only dialogue I ever want to hear coming out of these writers again is, ""You want fries with that?""

Sorry for the vitriole, but I just finished watching this series last night, and I wish I hadn't.",1200528000,4,940,4.497076023391813
2572702,4,B000FL7C8C,"The only reason I withheld one star is the packaging. Why on earth did they break this up with 2 eps per disc? It's unwieldy when folded out. They managed to put 3 and sometimes 4 episodes of Six Feet Under onto one disc, along with some commentaries; could they not have done this with Carnivale, making it an easily managed 4 discs per season package?

The one I received had a dinged, smushed corner, and the dinged package contained a loose disc because part of the plastic disc-holding hub had broken off. This happens with way too many box sets I buy. I would rather have DVD holders made from resilient, functional plastic instead of the clear yet brittle, easy-to-break stuff. It just doesn't hold or release DVDs well, and I honestly don't care about the art behind the discs when I'm trying to pry one off its hub.

Perhaps when I go dig into this richly mysterious story again, I'll be in a less gripey mood. Except of course I'll eventually have to re-confront HBO's colossally dingbat decision to cancel this series. It was exquisite torture watching this week by week; it kept me baffled for the longest time, yet I kept watching. Something about the combination of gritty, dusty period realism and arcane myth makes this a show unlike any other I can recall.",1192406400,6,1273,4.60352422907489
2572703,5,B000FL7C8C,"I agree with the other reviewers. Cancellation of this series will be seen later as a loss for HBO. It was easily one of the finest they have ever backed in terms of both storyline and acting. I hated being left hanging with the relationships and storyline unresolved. Hopefully a company with some sense will pick up this wonderful show and finish it. Even if it went straight to dvd, I would not hesitate to buy the rest of the series if it was done as well as the first two seasons.",1186617600,3,485,4.282608695652174
2572704,5,B000FL7C8C,"Why HBO didn't renew this series, I'll never know.  It's based back in the ""dust bowl"" era of America with a boy in a traveling circus and a preacher gone evil.  It deals with the power to heal, good vs evil, and more. Carnivable was based in a time of nobility.  However man created wonder for reason. And the show takes you back to that time of wonder and after each episode you think back to that time of nobility.

A very well made series!  But why didn't HBO keep going with it????",1182643200,26,486,4.182795698924731
2572705,5,B000FL7C8C,"Wow, my wife and I just came across this series and have been excited to see the second season.  It's a shame that we find out now that it was cancelled before it was resolved.  The acting is great and the storylines have great depth and are interwoven nicely.  I haven't seen a show this introspective since Northern Exposure.  Too bad there aren't more thoughtful, engrossing shows out there such as this.  I suppose most people don't like to get involved with their televisions, just want to be entertained.  Hope something comes of this series and there is resolution, a la Firefly and Serenity.",1181865600,5,599,4.711538461538462
2572706,5,B000FL7C8C,"To me this was the absolute finest production ever made for television/cable and because ""only"" several million totally devoted viewers could not get HBO to finish the four or five year series, we are left with two and will never know where this journey could have taken us all.  It is magnificent but it is painful to watch because you know that it is unfinished ""business.""  I for one have never watched HBO again because to make the time and emotional investment in Carnivale that so many of us made only to hear we didn't count, says to me that they can and most likely will do the same thing again.

HBO seems to thrive on super violent material that is laced with meaningless four letter words.  The actors on _The Sopranos_ certainly have a payroll that out does the production costs of Carnivale yet maybe there is no room even on cable for works of complexity that demand that viewers think.

So buy it and yes, HBO owns it and will profit - but just this one last time.  They abused their trust and far be it from me to ever again add to their coffers.",1168646400,67,1062,4.365482233502538
2572707,4,B000FL7C8C,"Easily as eliptic, complex and mysterious as ""Twin Peaks"" with more magic in its soul ""Carnivale"" only lasted two seasons on HBO because the witless suits didn't have the imagination to see the value the series added to their schedule. Keep in mind these are the same folks that also cancelled their second most watched series ""Deadwood"" after having already renewed if for a third.

Set during the 1934 dustbowl we first meet the ragtag members of the Carnivale as they pass through Oklahoma. Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl) mother has just died. His home is about to be bulldozed and the dust storms that struck the midwest rage incessantly. Jonesy (Tim DeKay)the head roustabout stands up to those about to destroy Hawkins home and helps him bury his mom as do the other members of the carnival. Suddenly their family whether Hawkins likes it or not.

It seems Hawkins has the ability to heal others and perform miracles. He's a lost soul in denial of his abilities and focused on discovering who he is. Across the U.S. in California Preacher Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and Mr. Crabs in ""Spongebobsquarepants"")discovers he has a similar gift but through circumstances beyond his control this fire and brimstone preacher who wants to do good loses his faith in God and finds himself on a very different path from the uncommunicative, uncertain Hawkins. The two men are linked both by their abilities and a series of dreams. ""Carnivale"" gives us their stories as they discover whether they are good or evil and find a place in the world for who they are as well as who they become.

Featuring an excellent cast (Michael J. Anderson from ""Twin Peaks"" as Samson, Clea DuVall, Patrick Bauchau of ""The Pretender"", Adrienne Barbeau, Amy Madigan, Ralph Waite and others)the thoughtful well written stories always manage to examine the darkness and light in each of these characters as they face their struggle tod discover to exist in a harsh world.

The show was designed as a six year experience. Unfortuantely HBO cancelled it after two. Although the ratings fell during the first set they began to pick up again during the end of the second season. The network elected to cancel the show and cut their losses. It's a pity as this was one of the most ambitious fantasy shows on TV and had a great storyline that I would have loved to see resolved. Hopefully one day creator David Knauf will have that opportunity in a movie.

The boxed set has some terrific extras for both seasons with commentary tracks, production featurettes and all of it is nicely packaged. It's a pity that HBO didn't give this show the same opportunity as ""Deadwood"" with a series of TV movies to close out the show. I've lost faith in the network's ability to recognize great programming and they've become just as bad as the other networks (if not worse because you're paying for it so you don't have to put up with the ads).

This twofer is definitely worth getting making the show much more affordable.",1157241600,76,3006,4.7711538461538465
2572768,5,B000FL7C8C,I really liked this. I started out watching on Netflix. Liked it so well  I thought it is something I would like to add to my DVD collection so I bought seasons 1 and 2. I think the ending could have been better if this was truly the end. It kind of left me thinking there might be a season 3.,1467331200,,293,3.80327868852459

2572770,2,B000FL7C8C,"It has been awhile since I purchased Seasons 1 & 2 of Carnivale from Amazon, I have watched it I guess maybe 10 times and I still cant figure it out. With Brother Justin and Ben's parts in it; I get no sense at all.  Ben is mostly in Texas & Southwest & Brother Justin and his counterparts California.???.  It just had too many things going on & neither really tied in with each other, to make any sense. I was also very disappointed that HBO didn't at Least give it 1 more Season, to make the Story a little more clear.  This is only My Opinion of the Series, But anyone that did watch  & Understood it.

2572776,4,B000FL7C8C,"Here's the deal, this series was pretty cool with some pretty fresh writing.  Now here's the problem, it is very plot based and they ended it after season 2...everything is left hanging with no resolution to anything at all.  If you could get this for 20 bucks it might be worth the frustration of feeling like you wasted all the time it took to watch the first two seasons to then be left with no conclusion to any aspect of the plot they had been developing.

2572822,5,B000FL7C8C,"There is ample evidence that we are presently inhabiting a golden age of television production. I have just completed episode 12, season 2 of Carnivle. Clearly, the series is only establishing itself at this point. The primary quality metrics I employ are (1) how much do I think about the program when I'm not watching it? (2) How high has it moved up on my list of free-time priorities? and (3) How much do I care about the characters and how events develop? On these three metrics, Carnivle ranks as (1) a constant daily companion in my thoughts; (2) the most important thing I do in my free time; and (3) introducing me to characters I am only starting to know, want to stay with much longer, and get to know much, much better. May I add that something magical must have happened at this programs auditions? Every character/actor match was inspired. I know that the characterization unique has frequently been applied to this series, and it is an appropriate choice. I can think of no other program that has (1) captured and developed the era of the dustbowl; (2) delved into the world of an itinerant, socially marginal subculture and brought it to life; (3) developed a unique (allegorical) mythology that says something authentic about our actual nature as humans; (4) left me thinking long afterwards about the themes explored by each episode; (5) so gloriously revelled in the magic and mystery of human differences and uniqueness; and, perhaps above all, (6) inspired me with regards to the importance and possibly lasting significance of the moral and spiritual struggles of daily life. If I were to fall into a small fortune tomorrow, I would consider using it to develop Carnivles seasons 3-6, as had originally been planned for this series. Bring it back? Carnivle still lives. Somewhere out there, it is real, even now. Id sure like to bring it back to the screen.",1420848000,2,1879,4.7846153846153845

2572842,5,B000FL7C8C,"In bed for three days with a humdinger of a cold I was fortunate enough that a friend loaned me the complete series one and two.  Followers of CG Jung (the great psychologist of the last century) must have had a field day with this one!  Filled with archetypal symbolism and graphic displays of the nature of evil.  Not to mention showing the shadow side of Christianity.  My first clue was in the opening scenes with the Tarot cards.  THE MOON was depicted as a devil entwined with snakes and THE SUN was depicted as the father God as depicted by Michaelangelo. Did you catch that?  This is the flaw in Christianity; that the female is intrinsically evil, the cause of all sin. And this wasn't the only indictment of our religion and our culture.  Flawed politics anyone?  What a shame they weren't allowed to complete this.  And I suppose by now it is too late.  Can you imagine the trouble they must have gone to to reproduce artifacts from the thirties?  The production designer must have had a ball!  I will have to live with the ending I guess:  that there really is not resolution in the matter of good vs evil.  It is an ongoing issue; both externally in the culture and internally in our own psyches. As they said: the Carnivale is there to wake us up!",1412640000,,1261,4.426086956521739

Maybe because it is set during the depression and you don't find many shows set during this period absides the 'Bonnie & Clyde""  or 'gangster' variety.  The sets and costumes are without equal and the storyline, although most unusual, is one that captures the imagination.  Wish there were more seasons to view -- I miss Samson, Jonesey and all the other characters.  You will, too.  This show is fantastic!",1388793600,2,504,4.606741573033708
2572884,5,B000FL7C8C,"At the time Carnivale ran on HBO, I didn't have cable and so rented the entire first season, then season two.  It took about seven episodes for me to get hooked--friends kept saying how wonderful it was--but it didn't click for me until we began to uncover Justin's history, the origins of his conflict and the suppression of his baser instincts.  What kept me going until that point was the absolute beauty of it.  Carnivale is a feast for the eyes: the California desert used for all dust bowl and southwest locales, the sets, costumes, props, colorized cinematography (color was deepened in post production.)--all of it.  Jeff Beal's score enhances mood, clarifies character, and is strong enough to stand on its own.

We follow the story of Ben Hawkins and Justin Crowe, whose lives are connected by fate and a common destiny.  Ben's painful journey is riveting; full of incident, mystery and synchronicity, the culmination of which builds toward a shattering climax in season two.  Revelation comes thoroughly and deliberately.  Though perhaps not quickly enough for some, it is satisfying for those who appreciate process: character development, specificity in storytelling and a universality that encapsulates man's internal and external struggles against a backdrop of the mythology of good vs. evil.  The result is a rich, transcendent tale that touched me emotionally, intellectually and spiritually.

I'm sorry the show was cancelled after two seasons.  I would like to have seen what the writers had outlined for the remaining three or four seasons come to fruition--the wound inflicted upon Ben by Justin that not even Ben can heal; Sophie raising Ben's and her and child in the same house with Iris; the power struggle between Iris and Sophie; Justin being ""brought back"" by Sophie as she begins to understand her own power; Justin's diminution as a force of evil as the darkness in Sophie takes hold, etc.  Ah, well!  As it is, however, you can take the end of season two as an ending for the series, as some major plotlines that were meant to plateau can stand firm as the end of the story.  It's a wonderful, unforgettable tale.

I own both seasons and watch them periodically.  Carnivale is affirmation that as confusing or difficult as life may be, with patience, persistence and faith, its mysteries will be unraveled and what we need to know will eventually be revealed to us.",1386547200,,2397,4.955
2572885,5,B000FL7C8C,This series was amazing and it's a horrific shame the writer was not allowed to continue the story line per studio/production company issues.

2572909,5,B000FL7C8C,"Carnivale was an excellent series, but far too subtle and sophisticated for the viewing audience of N. America. An imbecilic, one-dimensional mess like MAD MEN or AMERICAN HORROR STORY constitute the sort of drool that becomes popular, but a series like Carnivale was simply over the heads of the teeming masses of nincompoops and nitwits out there in TV land. You might have agreed with, or could warm up to, a story built around a religious ""Good vs Bad"" concept, but I personally couldn't.  However, if you had any brains at all and saw this series; just the visual impact of the highly varied characters struggling in wretched Dust Bowl era would cause you to appreciate the production as the great work of art it actually is. The story was good - too good for the audience it was intended for. The characters were all unique and very interesting. Each installment was gritty, dirty, and dark all the way through.......and, as a product, it definitely had the capacity to grip the intellect.
But of course, when it comes to the viewing audience of N.America it would be just too much to expect that such a wonderful effort would be a hit. Not enough mindless cartoon-like violence. No simplistic characters with infantile behavior patterns to appeal to the simplistic viewers. No high-speed automobile chases with lots of explosions. No soap opera nonsense such as the drek found in MAD MEN, or ludicrous over-the-top formula fright as found in American Horror Story. Everything that the animated garbage making up the viewing audience in N.America would love was not to be found in Carnivale.....which is why its a five-star series and worth every penny asked for the DVD sets.",1373587200,3,1682,4.881118881118881

Maybe had it been allowed to run its entire planned six-season arc it might've matured into a truly great series, but as it was, I found myself  let down as time and time again what I long predicted beforehand came to pass on the screen. Where were the plot twists, where was the epic scale, where were the memorable moments? I probably expected too much because I'd heard so much praise about it (yes, Rob, once again I mean you) but rather than experiencing a shiver-inducing work of darkness, I found instead a mildly disturbing Depression-era Gothic that was more about mundane grossouts than genuine supernatural eeriness.

2572963,2,B000FL7C8C,"I was drawn to this series by the numerous glowing reviews and the mystery that it seemed to behold.  However, appearances can be deceiving, and this series certainly had me fooled.
The pilot is full of portent, and seems to announce a truly remarkable adventure into the mystical struggle between the here-and-now and the forever after.  Don't be fooled.  This is Hollywood, where hokum rules.  Instead of an adventurous leap into the turbulent world of good versus evil, were are treated throughout the whole of the first season, and much of the second, to an infuriating series of episodes where virtually nothing happens and everything is repeated ad nauseum.  This series contains some of the laziest scriptwriting I have ever encountered.  I lost count of the number of dream sequences where the subject wakes up to find (for the umpteenth time) that what we have just seen was nothing more than a nightmare. You can just see it coming - like so may other highly repetitious scenes and endless flashbacks dotted throughout the 24 episodes.
This is an extremely imaginative concept and beautifully produced - but the whole thing, unfortunately, fails to live up to its initial promise, and in fact rapidly degenerates into what the carnival itself is: flim-flam.  I am still left wondering why the creator of this singular series was happy to let it meander aimlessly along, going precisely nowhere, for so many long episodes. What is the point of a good idea if you don't develop it? Apart from the atmosphere, which is beautifully captured, the story line is so weak as to be virtually insulting. If you like pretty boxes beautifully gift wrapped with almost nothing inside, this is the series for you. Others beware!",1299542400,5,1724,4.924137931034482

Love that we at least have the dvds to watch, although it still breaks my heart that we were left hanging. How cool would it be if they made a movie to wrap up, as was done with Firefly! Any thoughts, HBO?",1293321600,,457,3.872340425531915
2572966,5,B000FL7C8C,"I only heard of it recently, so I bought the 2 seasons. I read the raving, glowing reviews beforehand, so after the first couple of discs, I was wondering if I'd been had. Everything has its fans, I thought. Twin Peaks it ain't! But around the latter second half of the first season, I got hooked. There are many characters and mysteries so it doesn't start picking up momentum initially. We switch back and forth between the Carnivale and the Preacher, not really understanding clearly the link. Plus, it takes a while for the preacher thing to start cooking and ditto with the Ben Hawkins storyline. But around the time that Brother Justin goes ""missing"" and Jonesy hooks up with Rita Sue, it starts cooking. By the time the Ben, Management, and Lodz storyline involving Ruthie kicks in I am just hooked to the story. I breezed right through the rest, all the way to the end.

I am angry at the creators. The reason why HBO didn't release a 3 hour movie to wrap it up with was supposedly because the writer had too much story. Excuse me?! What kinda lazy, bollocks is that?! Editing is part of the job description! At least we got most of the major storylines wrapped up in Twin Peaks. Here nothing wrapped. It got even more unwrapped. But despite this, its worth watching anyway. I love some of the characters, which is a great compliment to any story. Jonesy was one of my absolute favorites (I was mortified in that horrifying scene- you know which one if you saw it) and why, oh why, did we end like we did with him? Nooooooo!!!!! Samson was awesome. I was so happy to see him again after TP. Brother Justin was just riveting and Iris was equally fasinating with her complex relationship with her brother. I did not care for the actress playing Sophie. I would have cast someone else. But she looks as odd as her character is, so it works anyway.

I highly recommend viewing this and if you are like me, don't worry about the initial lag. Have faith. It will suddenly switch into gear and then you won't want it to ever end. An extra little shout out to the graphics when they showed the apocalyptic tree scenes. The foreshadowing scene in the cornfield was also riveting. Great artistic direction there.",1281830400,8,2210,4.5225
2572997,5,B000FL7C8C,"I'm always slightly behind the curve when it comes to appreciating a cult show like CARNIVALE. (I didn't start watching OZ until it had been on for years and then watched 3 seasons in one week.)

The most strikingly thing about CARNIVALE is how the cast is a pitch-perfect mix of character actors, unknowns and modestly famous celebs. Anytime you see Clancy Brown AND Amy Madigan AND Patrick Bauchau in the same cast credits, you know it will be good! Cynthia Ettinger is flawless as the world-weary stripper/prostitute who falls painfully in love with Tim McKay's heroic Jonesy. Nick Stahl and Clea DuVall are both outstanding as young characters already damaged by Depression-era lives and relentless bad luck. Michael J. Anderson deftly plays the leader of the troupe as he walks a tightrope between deception and power.

Show creator Daniel Knauf apparently struggled for years to make it as a teleplay writer and then when the first season of CARNIVALE was completed had to struggle again to convince HBO to make the second season. Knauf currently writes for SPARTACUS BLOOD & SAND.

BATTLESTAR GALACTICA creator Ronald D. Moore was an exec producer on the first season of CARNIVALE and he has said he was very sad when it was canceled after two seasons.

The set and costume design (which won several Emmys and was nominated for at least a dozen) is flawless. You can almost feel the dust and dirt on your face in several scenes. The economic and cultural desperation resonates in the show as we watch victims of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl wander across a sun-blasted American West in search of any sort of salvation.

dear lovers of magic and myth,
... so naturally it got canceled. A story of magic, myth, mystery and the struggle of good and evil for possession of this world, this series never fails to entertain and mystify. Set during the great depression and involving the characters in a traveling carnival, its scope reaches through the ages in what seems a never ending conflict between the forces for liberation and those ever seeking control and power. The Indian poet and mystic Tagore wrote: ""The Devil seeks slaves and demands obedience. God desires companions and accepts love."" This tale illustrates this saying perfectly.

2573027,5,B000FL7C8C,"Carnivale is a unique Television experience that I would recommend to anyone. That is the short version of my review. But let us look at why I state this. Prior to actually watching the show, I had no idea what it was about, save for the fact that I vaguely remember the show being broadcast on HBO. But I had thought that the show was entirely about carnies and to me that did not sound appealing. For awhile I continued to avoid this show, until about 3 months ago when I finally broke down and made the purchase. I had been reading the various reviews on how great of a show this was and how it had died early. The current price for both seasons is a steal!!

When they finally arrived at my house I had no idea what I was about to get myself into. Ripping the plastic cover off season 1, I placed the first cd into my dvd player and began to workout. For me the best time to watch TV shows was during a good bike ride. The initial opening sequence was gripping and my bike ride soon became of secondary importance.

Two days later I had watched both seasons and I did not want to leave the world of Carnivale. Watching how Daniel Knauf intertwined the two stories of Ben Hawkins (good) and Brother Justin Crowe (evil) was fascinating. But what was even more intriguing was the constant struggle between good and evil. Although this was a ""basic"" struggle, what Mr. Knauf succeeded in doing was showing how both characters were corrupted by their surroundings and the events that took place. Both characters were prisoners of Mr. Knauf's story and as such, were destined to become enemies. These characters were very real and at times I found myself immersed in their stories. Call me crazy, but I felt as if I were living in the world of Carnivale. That is how good this series is and why I recommend it to everyone.",1250380800,12,1820,4.381656804733728

2573030,4,B000FL7C8C,"This HBO series was extremely well written and well made with a wonderful cast and perfect sets.  The only bad thing to say, really, is that it ends much too soon.  The classic good vs. evil story begins with a boy burying his dead mother in the barren waste of the dust bowl as his home is flattened by a bulldozer.  As it happens (or is it destined?) there is a traveling Carnivale passing by who offer to take the boy along with them to the next town they play.  The Carnivale is run by a little man (you may remember him from Twin peaks) and a shadowy ""manager"" who is never seen until into the second season.  The Carnivale's cast of characters include a bearded lady, a snake charmer, a strong man, a blind psychic, a Tarot card reader with a comatose, telepathic mother and more.  Each person has secrets that will unfold as the series progresses.  Their stories are juxtaposed by the story of a small town preacher and his sister who are the embodiment of ""wolves in sheep's clothing"".  The two stories run parallel at first and then begin to curve towards each other and finally intertwine.  Each new twist in the story pulls you deeper into the lives of the cast of characters.  You can never anticipate what will happen next.  It is always surprising and intriguing.  There is, in the final episode of season 2, a bit of an ending but it leaves so much still unresolved.  The series was cancelled by HBO before the writers could satisfactorily tie up all the loose ends.  I would love to see a movie or even a book that would complete the story.  Is it worth watching then, you may ask, if only to be left hanging at the end?  I would definitly recommend it.  This is a rare and wonderful television series and if enough people continue to rave about it and want more of it, maybe a movie would be considered.",1242000000,4,1820,4.385074626865672

It was the first time in I don't know how long, that I saw something on TV that drew from real American History and Biblical references to create a true American original Fantasy! It felt like, The Legend of Sleepy Hallow, or the tall tales of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox! But far more complex, textured and morbid.

I could not believe that HBO did not renew this show! Just when I (and many others) had delved so deep into its mythos! It's like reading an excellent book, but having someone yank it away and burn it when you were only 1/2 way through!! Watch the first two seasons just to see how amazing the development of this story is. Warning...not for the squeamish, like a lot of HBO fare, but this show does have a lot of dark and demonic references. But also glimpses of hope and miracles in one of America's darkest hours.

Complete First Two Seasons: $98

Separately,

Season One: $24
Season Two: $24

Do the math-- buying seasons separately is less than HALF the price of the full two season set.  Come on Amazon, change your policies and do the checks so that we can TRUST your pricing policies.

Series is intriguing, excellent, and with superb music scores, although it is not for everyone due to horrific scenes in some episodes and some adult material.

DVDs are single-sided (good!) but in those HARD push-center-button holders that DON'T WORK and make it more likely that you will damage the disks trying to get them out.  Come on DVD manufacturers, you can do better than that!!!
