Having 3 Rug Rat movies is going to make this long winter in South Dakota much more enjoyable with all the children having to stay indoors, also they are not garbage/trashy cartoons like the ones you see so much of today, they actually put work into their movies, so even adults will enjoy them over and over~my fav is Angelica.",1319500800,,420,4.467532467532467

I mean how can her parents spoil her sooo badly that not only she bullies others but seemingly gets away with it thanks to her parents.  Deedee makes me think of Clarissa's mom from Clarissa explains it all with all of the health food.

Because I'm not a fan of stacked discs and want them to be less prone to getting scratched, I ordered a flipper case and now the discs and the cover art are in it and I threw the original one they came in away.

5440056,5,B00AJCT3EI,"I LOVE the old Nicktoons. Aside from Spongebob, there are just no good, inspiring cartoons on anymore. Rugrats is among the best cartoons ever made. It's hard to describe. I know it may sound weird, but watching anything Rugrats (or anything early to mid 90s Nickelodeon) just makes me feel....safe, I guess you could say. You get this warm, comfortable feeling from beginning to end. Everything about Rugrats just screams comfort ; the bright neon colours, the fun and simple stories, great animation, and extremely relatable ideas.

Even as a grownup 35 year old guy, I really enjoy the Rugrats movies. You'd think that being a kids' show/movie series, it would be cheesy and bland. And to a certain extent, that's true. The movies ARE cheesy and sometimes bland. But that's what's comforting about it...at least to me. There is no bad language, no ""adult"" situations, and no real tense or nailbiting situations like you get with modern tv. Rugrats is just nice, comfortable, friendly stories and characters. You can just pop these movies in and sit back and relax for a couple of hours.

If you're a classic 90s Nickelodeon fan, or just prefer simpler 90s tv offerings, then pick this set up. You'll love it.",1439769600,8,1211,4.845410628019324

5440061,4,B00AJCT3EI,"when The Rugrats trilogy was on sale for 4.99 last month, I decided to buy it since I had decided to give my individual releases to my 5 and 7 year old grand nephews

However, this trilogy is re-issued by Warner Bros. Home video in partner with Paramount and there are some differences between the original paramount releases from the early 2000s and this trilogy.

For starters,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-original-Rugrats-movie-1999-Paramount-release/dp/0792155203/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The original Rugrats movie 1999 Paramount release</a>&nbsp;contained subtitles and A white label with Tommy, chuckie and Dil on it. The disc on the trilogy did not have subtitles (even thought the option on the menu is still there and the back of the packages says it does) and just had a plain clear label placed over a disc with a silver top

as for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-original-2003-Paramount-release-of-Rugrats-go-Wild/dp/B0000CABKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The original 2003 Paramount release of Rugrats go Wild</a>, The original release had a scratch N Sniff card and featured A picture of Spike on the DVD Disc. This trilogy is just a plain gray label. I suffer from OCD and these kind of things/changes bother me from time to time.

The case for it also could have been better. All They did was make the part that goes into the center hole of the disc longer so they can stack the DVDs on top of each other

other than that, for the 4.99 I paid, it's a great deal",1431907200,3,1578,5.697872340425532

5440069,5,B00AJCT3EI,"Whether you have the Rugrats Movie Trilogy in the bulky box or new single DVD case, the same manner SpongeBob's 1st to 3rd season sets ""went green"" lately, this makes a great companion for the season sets! All 3 movies didn't start out on TV, they debuted in theatres everywhere! The Rugrats Movie debuted in November 1998, and takes place smack in between seasons 5 and 6, when Dil came into the picture, or the world. In theatres, it was paired with the CatDog short ""Fetch!"", but such ain't the case on DVD; the DVD features the short called ""Winslow's Home Videos"" from the actual CatDog series (Fetch! would be in that series soon afterward). This very movie ended up the first non-Disney and non-Pixar animated movie to gross over $100 million worldwide. Anyway, the main ""attraption"" ends up a wild and wacky pursuit of the Rugrats trying to give Dil back to the ""hopsicle"", then a serious matter of Angelica and Spike trying to find them (after Dil took Cynthia) then the ""growed ups"" try to find them all, before another mangy mutt finds them first (in this case, a wolf)! Too bad the newspeople were making it sound silly and not so serious, to the point of mispronouncing all the Rugrats' names on live TV. And starting here, Tommy learns to be a caring big brother to Dil, to which their Daddy and Uncle Drew sadly never got along well. The 2nd part of the trilogy is Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, which debuted in November 2000, and took place smack in between seasons 6 and 7, when the majority of the cast goes on a trip to EuroReptarland in Paris, France, and eventually adding new members to the Finster family. EuroReptarland must be a parallel to the USA's real-life Anime Invasion; as Japanese culture and people, especially Kimi and Kira, invade France in this movie, Japanese animation was invading the USA's TV airwaves in real life at the time, including future Nicktoon series Digimon. In Rugrats in Paris, it seems Cruella De Vil has met her match in Kira's old boss Coco. Don't believe me? Watch it for yourself! And last but not least, the star-studded crossover movie, Rugrats Go Wild, debuted in the summer of 2003, and takes place after the (original) Wild Thornberrys Movie AND the middle of Rugrats' 8th season, when Spike and Fifi's puppies weren't old enough to be adopted yet (as he mentioned in one scene to Eliza and Darwin). It'll take a team effort to save the Rugrats gang AND The Wild Thornberrys from certain danger AND disaster when they get stuck on a tropical island, and end up a reincarnation of Gilligan's Island (which was heard of in Rugrats years before this movie). Brace yourselves for a bunch of gross-out gags, even some never seen in either series on their own, thus giving Rugrats Go Wild its PG rating (the other 2 were thankfully rated G). All 3 movies can be seen in Widescreen (or CinemaScope with Rugrats Go Wild) on 16x9 TVs, and in Fullscreen with 4x3 TVs (Rugrats in Paris is only in Widescreen). The last 2 movies contain a lot of bonus features, like deleted and/or extended, unfinished epilogues, old commercials, short documentaries and more. Sadly, the scratch-and-sniff feature for Rugrats Go Wild is somewhat obsolete or needless since there's no scratch-and-sniff sheets in this set. If you're wondering about how Dil and Kimi joined the Rugrats in the first place, and how they had another fun-filled crossover with another popular Klasky Csupo Nicktoon, it's all contained in this trilogy set! Don't ask me how it is, but this trilogy set in a single case is under $10, as another link here has the same thing for $20! Add this 3-disc wonder to your Rugrats DVD collection today, unless you already have them all in single cases, or already in this 3-disc single case! All 3 movies were already on DVD years before Amazon got around to making the season sets; same way with the 2 Tales From The Crib movies which debuted after the original series ended. It's a lucky thing that all 9 seasons of Rugrats are now under $20 each here, so it'd be even easier to add this collection to them!",1406592000,22,4061,4.657381615598886
