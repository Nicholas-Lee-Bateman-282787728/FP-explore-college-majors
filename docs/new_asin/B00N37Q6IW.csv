6608395,1,B00N37Q6IW,"I think this is true but far too much information for anyone.  I listened for 28 minutes and decided it was  not something I want in my mind.  Paul didn't tear down Artemus.  He exalted Jesus.  I do think Doug Hamp is right that the antichrist will get some of satan's dna put into him and be supernatural and that that is what the mark of the beast actually will be.  Power (everyone wants to be superman).  Get close to Jesus.  He will guide you in love and wisdom.

The early church checked out whether people were really Christian by where they stood on the imminent return of Jesus Christ.  Both Washer and Hamp are post trib so be very careful.",1425772800,2,650,4.297520661157025
6608396,4,B00N37Q6IW,"Enlightening.  My first experience with Mr. Shimura was in the form of his DVD entitled Age of Deceit:  Fallen Angels and the New World Order, which is why I ordered the three subsequent ones.  Age of Deceipt 2, Disc One, was faulty.  By that I mean the last chapter of this DVD would not play at all.  I cleaned and restarted it and forwarded to the last chapter, and it still would not play.  That was disappointing; very disappointing.  Have not yet viewed Discs 2 and 3 yet, but plan to do so soon.",1419811200,5,502,4.276595744680851
6608397,5,B00N37Q6IW,"...few are aware that our world is highly illusory, and even fewer are brave enough to embrace that fact.
Still fewer are sounding the alarm on what IS and what lies ahead.

My heart goes out to those who refuse to pull their heads from the depths of the sand, and in their stubbornness of heart I fear an eternity hangs in the balance.  The human mind is amazing!  Of course, just because we can construct an alternate form of reality while simultaneously ignoring the facts of this one changes not ONE jot or tittle! (That is, nothing)

I pray you embrace the truth, follow the trail....trust the trailblazers who come in the name of the Lord!
Just be sure you've got the right Lord.
And don't forget discs 2&3

P.S.  this video is FREE on youtube, these guys aren't about the $$ but the truth.
Adding this to your physical DVD collection is an act of spreading the Gospel.
Share it, watch it, and be confident of the dent it's making in the devil's kingdom.",1413504000,13,960,4.426136363636363
6608398,5,B00N37Q6IW,"Highly recommended! Increasing knowledge of technology is bringing many good things to us from health care to widespread evangelizing of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There is a sinister side to this technological boom however, and it was PROPHESIED IN THE BIBLE! This presentation will show you that not only messing with nature through geo-engineering and genetically modified foods, but most importantly tampering with God's building blocks of creation, DNA, and merging flesh with machine (or more appropriate, iron mixed with miry clay) is guaranteed to bring us wrath.",1409616000,8,572,5.438202247191011

8675983,1,B00N37Q6IW,"I've now watched both complete Age of Deceit movies. Definitely interesting stuff, but the droning voices and hypnotic background track reminds me of something  L Ron Ron Hubbard-ish.  I think these movies are plainly presenting all the teachings and awesome stuff that satanism has to offer YOU, along with helpful books and authors you'll learn about to help you in your satanic studies,  while making sure you'll worship him by specifically NOT telling you that satan comes as the false Christ first. Run from the scary devil system straight to Jesus instead....as long as you're sure it's the true Christ. This film comes close to telling you that most important part, yet leaves that out. But then that's how satan operates, deceiving by quoting scripture and leaving out the truth at the end. This movie would have you on the lookout for the antichrist to appear as Robocop rather than appearing as Christ looks in order to make people think he IS Christ, as the Bible clearly states he will. Christ does not look like a robot, so why would satan appear that way? They have you thinking satan will deceive us through technology, but did they stop to think that perhaps he is creating all this satanic technological confusion in order to simply present himself as our savior from the chaos we think we've created ourselves? These films pretty much present single possibilities so they make sure THEY have you locked into what they want you to think is going to happen. This conspiracy film maker has become what he's trying to expose. A fear monger. The film makers may not realize it, but these movies are definitely satanic propaganda. Very interesting. Genius deception, but can be seen through right down to the hypnotic, brainwave altering soundtrack. If you want to learn all the great things satan can offer you that you didn't even know existed, then let this movie teach you satanism so you can see what you've been missing all your life! Real truth is taught through love, not fear, conspiracy and propaganda. The film maker is so steeped and entranced in Internet, YouTube, Satanic studies, conspiracy theories, technology studies and the ways of the world, it would seem there's not much room for true clarity of God's Word. Conspiracy theorists should not set themselves up as Bible teachers. Half truth is a dangerous thing.",1461196800,4,2343,4.881909547738694
