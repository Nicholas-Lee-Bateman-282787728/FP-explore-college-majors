5854911,5,B00DTPRYY8,"After the release of Chucky the Killer DVD Collection, people decided to make Chucky: The Complete Collection which is awesome !  Chucky the Killer DVD collection that comes with 2-5, all four movies come on two discs, part 5 is R-Rated instead of unrated & does not include part 1. Chucky the Complete Collection comes with all six movies ! It includes the first Child's Play, Child's Play 2, Child's Play 3, Bride of Chucky, Seed of Chucky (Unrated & Fully Extended) and finally Curse of Chucky (R-Rated & Unrated), in which all six movies come on six discs. Two things I liked and disliked about to compare the two dvd collection. 1: On the complete collection, Child's Play, Bride of Chucky, Seed of Chucky, and Curse of Chucky came with special features, same thing with the killer dvd collection Bride of Chucky & Seed of Chucky came with special features. 2: What I disliked about  both dvd collections is that Child's 2 & 3 didn't come with special features, only trailers. I'm hoping that they will make another collection that will include special features for both 2&3 , other than that it is a great collection. I give this collection a 9/10. good series !",1451865600,,1168,4.665048543689321

5854956,5,B00DTPRYY8,"Child's Play is by far my favorite horror franchise of all time. I have always liked Chucky because he's very sneaky and smart. Brad Dourif does an excellent job as the voice of Chucky.

Review for each film:

Child's Play (1988) - This classic film is where it all started. When I was a kid, I didn't know what this movie was called. I just kept calling it Chucky. 4/5

Child's Play 2 (1990) - This movie was even better than the first one. Too bad that they didn't show the alternate ending because I like that ending a lot better. 5/5

Child's Play 3 (1991) - This film wasn't as good as the first two, but it wasn't bad either. 3/5

Bride of Chucky (1998) - This is my favorite film in the entire series. 5/5

Seed of Chucky (2004) - I'm sorry to say that this film is the worst film in the series. It didn't really have that much killing in it. I honestly thought that it was going to be similar to ""Bride of Chucky"". 1/5

Curse of Chucky (2013) - At first, I thought this movie was going to be just as terrible as ""Seed of Chucky"" but this movie turned out great. 5/5

Overall, this is a really great collection to own. I heard that they might make a seventh Chucky film in 2017. I hope they do.",1444780800,13,1201,4.102564102564102

5854960,5,B00DTPRYY8,"I grew up with the Child's Play franchise. The first and second will always be classics to me. They along with Child's Play 3 are the best out of all 6 movies. For anyone that loves horror, gore, and dark humor needs to watch these movies. The only one that can really be bypassed is Seed of Chucky. I honestly was like ""WTF"" through the whole movie. It was weird, confusing, and didn't make a lot of sense to me. Bride of Chucky wasn't that bad but the first three will always be my top favorites as I said out of all 6. Curse of Chucky also wasn't too bad. The only downside is that he didn't have his ""human"" traits added to him where he bleeds when someone injures him.

In concerns to the blood factor for Chucky himself... there really isn't any. He doesn't talk as Charles Lee Ray as much or act I guess as ""Classic"" Chucky would. The storyline for it makes sense unlike that of Seed. One, Two, and Three all connected with each other in a proper storyline. If you compare the Child's Play series with say the Halloween series, there's more of a solid storyline in the Child's Play one than in Halloween. It doesn't get horribly off track; just with Seed it got very weird.

I would say, if you want to see these movies, buy Child's Play 1, 2, 3, Bride, and Curse. Don't bother with Seed. But if you want to be more of a collector; as I am of horror films, this box set is absolutely perfect for that purpose since it has all 6 movies in one box along with hours upon hours of extra features. I bought this set because the first set I bought did NOT have the first Child's Play movie which made zero sense to me. It had been released before Curse came out so it didn't bother me that wasn't with it. But this one has all six so now I can replace the other one with this set.",1442620800,14,1781,4.144508670520231

5855033,4,B00DTPRYY8,"All 6 Child's Play/Chucky movies are in one set, for the first time ever together (Child's Play 1 is actually owned by MGM/Fox)
Each film is on it's own individual disc and carries over all the special features from the DVD's (all except 2 & 3 which only have a trailer only).  The packaging itself, as usual with these sets, leaves a lot to be desired.  The discs are contained in a very light cardboard fold out, with two discs in each section.  The discs are stacked on top, so to get the bottom disc out you have to take the top one out first to get to the second title, making it difficult to get out as it normally is with this idiotic packaging.  There is no real art or each movie, and it is average or below at best in quality of packaging.  For the right price owning all 6 movies can be a treat, just too bad they weren't in their own individual case, and could have all used some new extras (well 2 & 3 especially).",1424649600,5,927,4.127777777777778

5855257,5,B00DTPRYY8,"I saw this advertised a while ago, i didn't think much of it (since being in Australia, we're not exactly privy to what America gets) but i found out it all regions, so i snatched it up quick smart and haven't looked back. I've been a big fan of Chucky ever since i was born (1-5 is considered canon) while 6 is for the new fans (it's ok but if you already knew why he ran, it's hardly worth watching).

After watching all the movies (apart from 6, which looked too good for Blu-Ray) i can say that it's the best they're gonna look for a long time and it's gonna be a long time, maybe even longer before Australia is even considering a box set, even then, maybe for DVD. Australia gets a 1.33:1 transfer for Bride of Chucky, not clean, reel change markings, a not so good stereo track and one 2 minute behind the scenes, while the Blu-Ray in this box set gets a 1.85:1 transfer, super clean, sharp and vibrant while the DTS Master Audio 5.1 leaves the DVD for dead with the track being utilized properly with the surrounds and bass with the extras, 2 commentary tracks and a 10 minute behind the scenes featurette.

the only bad part of this set is that Seed Of Chucky has only the Unrated Cut of the movie, no Seamless Branching for the Theatrical Version which is a bit of a shame and while part 2 and 3 may only have DTS Master Audio 2.0, they serve the films well enough.

The original Child's Play was just a one-off shocker that put a new-ish spin on the slasher genre by having the killer be a kid's doll possessed with the soul of a dead serial-strangler (though Don Mancini's original script ""Blood Buddies"" was more of a satire on kid's marketing and did not feature Charles Lee Ray). It became clear afterwards that the outrageousness of the idea could lend itself to more humor-orientated sequels and that Chucky himself had potential that stretched beyond just one movie.

As a result, this first Child's Play movie seems to be a bit different from the rest. Don't get me wrong, the franchise is pretty good with it's continuity which is unusual for horror films, but first time around the makers played it for straight, which gives it different edge from the rest. Obviously they didn't want to play their ace right away so for the most part, Chucky is rather quiet in this one. Later on, his star would shine brighter.

Chicago cop Mike Norris guns down killer Charles Lee Ray in the street, but before Ray dies he breaks into a toy store and transfers his soul into a Good Guy doll. Knowledge of Voodoo is pretty much the first thing that you're taught in serial killer class. That very same doll is given to lonely little boy Andy Barclay for his birthday, but he's not aware of the evil lurking within.

Judging the film on its own merits it's not exactly the best shocker out there. There are only a couple of scare moments and a couple of those are badly timed and obviously telegraphed. The story isn't as tight as it should be and there's simply not enough kills. The sequels had bigger body counts and more interesting deaths.

Child's Play 2 - 3.5/5

Universal must have realized the potential this franchise had and quickly snapped up the rights from MGM after the first movie came out. Writer Don Mancini also must have figured out that his creation of a foul-mouthed killer doll was too good for just one film. The Chucky series would seriously evolve and change over the years but even in this first sequel things are already looking quite different, even if it suffers from Deja Vu a little bit.

Now that the cat is out of the bag and we know that Chucky really is alive and it isn't just Andy's imagination, our killer doll gets much more screen time and his wicked personality has more time to develop. The animatronics have improved and a lot of Chucky's character comes through in his wild facial expressions.

Director John Lafia shoots the film with a bright, playroom color pallet with most of the location footage done in Los Angeles with only a few key shots done in Chicago (as if the Windy City was ever this sunny). Despite the autumn setting it does feel like a rather Xmas-y film. He's also fully aware of how silly the killer doll concept is and seizes the opportunity for some of the self-aware sarcastic humor seen in the later films.

Graeme Revell usually does the most generic horror scores, especially in recent years, but surprisingly he gives Child's Play 2 the best score of the series with a full orchestra at his disposal, he doesn't hold back on the action cues and even delivers a couple of pretty good themes. So much better than the rotten score to the first film and probably one of the best horror scores of the 90s, or even of all time. It really is that good, and elevates this sequel to a higher level than most snobby critics would consider it deserves.

There isn't much of a story to Child's Play 2 however. It's just the same as the first, with Chucky going after Andy, who is now staying with a foster family, once more. The body count is higher and there are some good kills, but I wish that the running time wasn't so anorexic and that it held back on the ""lurking in the dark"" scenes.

The slick quality and silly nature of Child's Play 2 is probably what prompted Universal to stick with the franchise for good and 23 years later the Chucky films are still coming out. To think that if MGM held on to the rights, we may never have had them.

Child's Play 3 - 3/5

Set eights years after Child's Play 2, this sequel sees Andy Barclay attending Military School and getting bullied by the drill sergeant (""poor man's Christian Slater"" Travis Fine, who never really became as popular as he should have been). Meanwhile, the Play Pals company has reopened the Good Guy factory and is starting production of the doll once more. But when clearing away Chucky's grisly remains, some of his blood spills into a vat of molten plastic and he is born once more in a new body.

After a good old strangulation to get the circulation going he locates Andy at his military school and somehow figures out a way to mail himself there. However, once the package gets there it is promptly snatched by a very annoying, morbidly juvenile, and highly wimpy little kid called Tyler who has the same face as has-been 'singer' Craig David, only more annoying (if that is even possible). Since he has a new body Chucky reveals his birth name once more, hoping to get a fast and easy ticket out of his plastic shell. As before there are too many distractions.

And as before the film spends way too much time with boring humans who spend too much time lurking in the dark wondering why a doll seems to appear and reappear and not enough time with Chucky. He IS the star of the show and he should OWN this movie. Alias and Lost director Jack Bender never really gives him the chance. Which is a shame since the animatronics had improved over Child's Play 2 and Chucky was beginning to look nastily cute. And more and more like Brad Dourif if you look hard enough. Bender's direction is slick but lacks edge, invention or humor. He seems to be ignorant of the potential Chucky has and treats the film like another mechanical TV series with no spark or signature. I remember when I first watched the VHS tape as a kid I immediately noticed how darker and gloomier this movie is, which ultimately leads to an overwhelming downbeat, depressing atmosphere, that sort of does and sort of doesn't work.

The score is a major downer though. Greame Revell's wonderful orchestral adventure of Child's Play 2 has been replaced with a horrid synthesized, death-metal score filled with tacky and unimaginative stingers. Revell, fortunately, returned for Bride of Chucky.

Child's Play 3 is no more than a competent sequel. Writer Don Mancini said he wasn't even ready to do a 3rd movie but Universal forced him to before the second was even released. As he was out of ideas he claims this film to be his least favorite of them all. If a better director were involved it could still have been a good film instead of being a merely an above average (by a tiny, tiny bit) one.

Bride of Chucky - 4/5

After being stuck in an evidence locker since he was diced in a giant fan at the end of Child's Play 3, Chucky is freed by corrupt cop Bailey, sent by his girlfriend Tiffany. Officer Bailey is quickly offed and Chucky is taken home in multiple broken pieces. Using bits off her massive doll collection Tiffany manages to bring Chucky back to life using another chant to the mighty Damballa.

As soon as he's on his feet Chucky does yet another killing to get the circulation going. Tiffany is excited and can't wait to get Chucky into a human body so they can get hitched. But Chuck is dead against marriage and laughs in her face. Dejected, Tiffany locks him in a play pen while she blows off some steam. Not taking kindly to being locked up, Chucky breaks out and kills her by knocking a TV into her bathtub.

Another chant to Damballa brings her back in the form of one of her many dolls. Angry with the loss of her nice, fleshy body and being stuck in a short, plastic one, Tiffany starts researching ways to help herself without Chucky's aid. Tough luck, the only way out is with the help of an amulet that was buried with Chucky's human body years ago.

Conning a couple of local lovebirds, hick Jesse and well-to-do Jade, into driving them to the graveyard in New Jersey, Chuck and Tiff begin a cross-country killing spree, leaving a pile of dead bodies in their wake that the cops assume are the work of Jesse and Jade. Marital disputes between couples both flesh and plastic follow. Don't laugh, it's good! The formula of Child's Play was wearing mighty thin by the end of the 3rd film and really needed a fresh new spin to keep it alive. Don Mancini struck the nail right on the head when he turned it into a post-modern horror. Remember, this was back in the days when post-modern horror was all the rage so it might seem just the tiniest bit dated now. But compared to the endless Urban Legend, Scream and I Know yadda yadda films of that era Bride of Chucky seems to have the sharpest wit, the slickest direction and strongest production values.

Director Ronny Yu gives us plenty of eye-candy and shoots the film with lots of darkness and deep blacks. A horror series like this needs technical superiority and imagination when it comes to direction and Ronny Yu soars over Jack Bender's mundane approach to Child's Play 3.

Composer Graeme Revell returns and delivers a more sophisticated, if slightly generic, score to those awful death-metal guitar/synthesizer cues to Child's Play 3. His main theme from Child's Play 2 comes and goes briefly and he forgets the huge orchestral mayhem he did before. But he does introduce a very cool Twin Peaks-style love theme for Chuck and Tiff. An alright score overall that really should get a release on CD.

Katherine Heigl is very easy on the eye as is Jennifer Tilly (as a human). Plus it also features one of my favorite actors, the late John Ritter, who died in 2003. Margot Kidder's gorgeous niece Janet also has a small role and Kathy Najimy (that's Peggy Hill for you King of the Hill fans) cameos as a distressed Motel Maid.

My only problem is that the film should have been longer, with a more satisfying ending. Chucky has done the Damballa chant so many times now that I just want to see it work for a change. In the DVD commentary Don Mancini said that the film originally had Jesse possessed by Chucky and that the final showdown had more to it. I would have liked to have seen this instead of the weak ending that wound up in the film. For such an elaborate and imaginative horror movie, Bride of Chucky goes out with a whimper instead of a bang.

That said, it was still the best of the post-Scream horror films that surfaced in the late-90s and the best of the Chucky series. The subsequent Seed of Chucky was still pretty damn good, but felt like it belonged in a different genre.

Seed of Chucky - 3/5

The Chucky films have had a curious consistency in the decline of horror and the incline of humor. Child's Play was played straight for chills. Yes, it was ridiculous but had a rather mean-spirited edge to it that made you forget how silly it was. Child's Play 2 was less savage but with a touch more humor. Child's Play 3 found the right balance between laughs and scares. Chucky was downright evil, but you began to root for him more and more because his one-liners and easily irritable personality became rather er...cute. Ronny Yu's Bride Of Chucky, while very gory, simply was not a horror film at all - an entertaining black comedy that was ridiculously over-the-top, yes, but not a horror.

Now, fifth time around, series creator Don Mancini steps behind the camera, cranks the bad taste all the way up to eleven and delivers the most wannabe intelligent dumb film you've ever seen (a back-handed compliment, I must admit). The horror is non-existent but the gore is plentiful and the humor sicker than a syphilitic junkie. He rips out all the stop signs with such carefree abandon and directs with such hedonistic pleasure that the film becomes an endurance test for anyone who is not a hardcore Chucky fan.

The child born at the end of Bride Of Chucky (voiced by Billy Boyd) has been picked up by a gruff English new age traveler and made to act in a fake ventriloquist circus show, thanks to his bizarre doll-like appearance. He knows he's not normal, suffers terrible nightmares of killing and slaughter, and is eager to find his real parents.

In Hollywood, a new movie called Chucky Goes Psycho, starring Jennifer Tilly, based on the Chucky urban legend is in production and when the young orphan sees a behind-the-scenes clip of what can only be his real mum and dad on TV, he escapes to Tinseltown to find out why they abandoned him. The obligatory chant to the almighty voodoo god Damballa resurrects Chucky and Tiffany, who are more than delighted to be together with their own child. Trouble is, they can't decide whether he's a boy, or a girl - a Glen, or a Glenda.

However, the killer dolls are still keen to get out of their plastic bodies once and for all and be human again. Obviously Tiffany is partial to Jennifer Tilly's body and Chucky aims to switch places with rapper/actor/director Redman who is planning a new Jesus Christ movie. As you can imagine, many deaths occur along the way, much to the distress of Glen/Glenda.

John Waters - the King of Bad Taste himself - has a hilarious extended cameo as a sleazy tabloid photographer who happens to snap a silhouetted image of Chucky hammering one off to a porno mag. How crazy is that? Chucky himself is a wonderful comic character. You just can't help but love him. Don't you think that he and Tiffany make a cute couple? His mere presence makes every scene a riot.

Seed Of Chucky is not a film for everyone. You have to be pretty open-minded to endure the morbid humor, but it's the guiltiest pleasure you're likely to have for a long time. The self-aware Hollywood references never become intrusive and the convoluted story never becomes confusing. It's not easy going entertainment if you're a stuffy conservative.

All fans of gore and brainless amusement must see. It even manages to cram in a cameo for Young Sherlock Holmes himself as Jennifer Tilly's lawyer.

Curse of Chucky 3/5

From the first couple of minutes it's easy to tell that Don Mancini is treating Curse more as a horror film than the previous couple of entries in the series. The movie is shot and edited to build suspense and is a world apart from the sitcom trappings of Seed.

A girl in a wheelchair (Brad Dourif's hot daughter Fiona) living in a rural home with her troubled mother receives a mysterious package one afternoon. It's Chucky, and he's somehow managed to get himself in the mail again. He's arrived to settle a score, and soon enough he has brainwashed a child into keeping his secret and is sneaking about in the shadows offing unsuspecting victims.

Many people are saying that this movie is a return to form, and that it retcons Bride and Seed out of existence. Er...no, the film very much DOES acknowledge the events of Bride and Seed. Even if you paid the bare minimum of attention it would be hard to not to realize this. But I guess that expecting the movie to go in a different direction only led to further surprises when it eventually did tie in to the previous movies as well as giving us more back-story to Charles Lee Ray.

I was worried that Chucky would be all CGI as Kevin Yagher has not been involved with the series since Bride, and while there IS some CGI, he's anamatronic for the most part. Instead of hogging the camera though he keeps quiet watches the humans interact for about half the movie before unleashing toy terror. Horror composer Joseph LoDuca delivers a pastiche of the Renzetti, Revell, and Donaggio's efforts without giving Curse a signature sound of its own. Not really a complaint, but more of a missed chance.

It's certainly a worthy sequel and a can be viewed as a genuine horror film without any of the guilty pleasure of Seed. Keep watching to the end of the credits for a further surprise that ties the series together even more (though it does contradict the closing scene before the credits actually roll).

VIDEO/AUDIO/EXTRAS

Child's Play
Picture 4/5
Sound 4/5
Extras 4/5

As it is an MGM movie the first movie has better video than the most of the sequel, as Universal are very lazy with their catalogue titles while MGM actually take care and make an effort. Child's Play was shot by expert cinematography Bill Butler (he who shot Jaws and most of the Rocky movies) on 35mm with a plain 1.85:1 aspect ratio that had never a proper release on home video until the Blu-ray was mastered back in 2010. It looks and sounds brilliant in 1080p with lossless DTS HD-MA, and way better than I imagined it could. There are plenty of extras too. The rest of the movies were made by Universal, and I do hope that they look at the great presentation of this film and put the rest of the Chucky films out there in glorious high-def.

Child's Play 2
Picture 4/5
Sound 4/5
Extras 1/5

The movie is presented in 1.85:1 1080p which is a significant improvement on the 1999 DVD. Cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, who went on to shoot Batman Returns and Ed Wood, uses a lot of wide angles lenses, which have an out of focus ring around the edges of some shots, but don't be alarmed when you spot that on the Blu-ray - it's intentional. The color saturation and blacks are solid and it's the best the movie has ever looked since it hit cinemas in 1990. The DTS HD-MA 2.0 soundtrack is loud and crystal clear. The only extra is the trailer, in standard definition too. The menus are terrible also.

Child's Play 3
Picture 4/5
Sound 4/5
Extras 1/5

Child's Play 3 was shot in 1.85:1 on 35mm by veteran cinematographer John R. Leonetti, who most recently shot the Conjouring and the Insideous movies. The 1080p mastering features lots of deep blacks and good contrast levels. It's leaps and bounds better than the DVD. The soundtrack is in DTS HD-MA 2.0, and while it is very good, it lacks the classic punch of Child's Play 2 thanks to Graeme Revel being replaced as the composer. The only trailer is a standard definition trailer.

Bride of Chucky
Picture 3.5/5
Sound 4/5
Extras 3/5

Oscar-winning cinematographer Peter Pau shot Bride of Chucky in 1.85:1 on 35mm Kodak Vision 200T. The transfer is a huge step-up from the DVD with lots of deep blacks. The movie overdoes the lightning flashes and darkness, which has a detrimental effect on the overall quality. Daytime and brightly lit scenes look brilliant, but dark scenes look less attractive. The sound is in very good DTS HD-MA. Two commentaries and a fluff featurette are included.

Seed of Chucky
Picture 3.5/5
Sound 4/5
Extras 4/5

Seed of Chucky was shot in 1.85:1 on 35mm by working man cinematographer Vernon Layton. It never really looked good in theatres, on DVD, or on HD-DVD. And this Blu-ray transfer is just a port of the 2007 defunct high-definition medium. It is pretty average I'm afraid. Scenes shot on location sparkle with brightness and are very crisp and colorful, but scenes shot on a soundstage look very soft and two-dimensional. Layton doesn't light or frame the film like a horror, but like an upmarket sitcom. A more skilled cameraman might have made all the difference. The DTS HD-MA soundtrack fares a lot better, and there are loads of extras.

Curse of Chucky
Picture 5/5
Sound 4/5
Extras 3.5/5

Curse is significantly superior to Seed when it comes to cinematography. The movie was shot in ProRes 4:4:4 by Michael Marshall, who mainly has experience in Canadian TV shows. While I do not doubt that the movie would look better on 35mm film I still have no complaints regarding the picture quality. It's clean, it's sharp, the blacks are bold and colors sparkle. The DTS HD-MA sound is not without stingers, but they're smartly done. A decent amount of extras are included.",1383091200,4,20071,4.66091628959276
5855302,5,B00DTPRYY8,"I recently received this box set as a birthday gift. I remember fondly watching the first three movies as a ten-year-old boy during sleepovers, so I was dreading watching them again. I was sure that the movies I so fondly remembered would have become cheesy or boring, and I didn't know what to expect from the three newest entries in the series. To my surprise, the first three movies stayed in a tone of subversive darkening of childhood tropes. In these, Chucky is scary because he is a perversion of the toys we used to play with, and he often uses childlike weapons such as a plastic shovel or toy mallet. The next two movies (Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky) aren't scary, but they're incredibly funny, using the innocent appearance of the dolls to make witty observations of our gore-hungry culture. The most recent entry, Curse of Chucky, feels like a reboot. Instead of the humorous or action-packed romps we've seen before, this is an atmospheric Gothic meditation on family and legacy. A young woman receives a Chucky doll in the mail, and we get a fantastically restrained forty-five minute stretch where tension mounts, followed by a flurry of horror that ties this movie in to the first five. Note: stay for the post-credits scene!
To those of you who remember Chucky as a guilty pleasure, I can confidently absolve you of your guilt and recommend this box set as a Halloween treat.",1382659200,,1399,4.714285714285714

I had seen trailers for it on IMDB.com, and read thoughts & opinions on it; knew that it was a new movie, but was also leery about it because it was said that it was & is a reboot/sequel.

I'll do my best to not say or reveal any spoilers about it, but I *WILL* say that yes, ""Curse Of Chucky"" is in fact a Reboot/Remake-Sequel hybrid. It is a Reboot/Remake because it is a new story & the director wanted to go back to all gore, not too much humor; and a Sequel because it manages to keep up & follow the mythology of the originals well. While watching it, I wasn't quite sure on how it tied in or followed the other 5 movies until it was revealed close to or in the final act of the movie. I was just thankful that it was made by the director of the original *AND* also starred Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky. I honestly do not think there would be anyone else who'd be perfect for the role.

5855329,5,B00DTPRYY8,"One of the greatest, woefully underrated and reprehensibly discarded horror franchises of all time, the Child's Play series has finally received it's rightfully deserved recognition from it's godfather studio (Universal) and the original studio that had begotten and disowned it (MGM). As most of you may not be aware, this has the potential of a limited edition (as stated on the packaging) due to MGM owning the rights to the original Child's Play and Universal owning it's sequels, therefore connoting that a deal has been struck between the studios. Alas, I'll contend that the studios deal will not be a long one, especially if the boxset does not prove to be lucrative, or they simply place this exquisite franchise back into the attic as if it was an ignominious, deformed child.

Certainly, I could elucidate redundantly on my vehement passion for the Child's Play films and scrutinize every morsel of each film. However, I will deduce that you are not looking at this boxset and reading reviews for a lucid description of the films and all they entail. Instead, you're curiosity lies in whether the purchase of this item is relevant and worthwhile under the criteria that the Blu-ray transfers are top quality and that the price tag is justified. So I will not superfluously detail the films themselves, as I'm certain you already comprehend the magnitude of awesome that Chucky has brought to horror and the art of film in general. Instead, I will explain whether this boxset is worthy of Chucky's namesake. I mean not to be pretentious in that last statement but I've watched aghast as the Child's Play franchise has languished for years searching for the credibility it humbly deserves and instead gets ignored if favor of repugnant trash like Paranormal Activity and other puerile films that atrophy the horror genre.

Enough of the overzealous rhetoric from me, to review this I will state a little of my experience with these films. Child's Play was the first horror film I ever saw, at the primordial age of 4 at a daycare of the time, and the ardent passion it placed in me has drawn a lifelong obsession and addiction to horror films of all types and it has been a bucket list mission of mine to see every horror film ever made. So my experience in horror as a whole is, not to be pedantic, extremely well-versed. Now I have purchased, owned and viewed this franchise on 3 different formats (having previously possessed films 1-5 on VHS, DVD and now Blu-ray). So to my credibility I can say without ambivalence that these Blu-ray transfers are the best the films have ever sounded and been viewed, even the film I worried would be an upscaled DVD, Child's Play 3, which is castigated even by fans of this series and disregarded erroneously. And although the special features of Child's Play 2 and 3 are mere theatrical trailers. 1, 4, 5 and 6 have them aplenty to keep the lot of us Chucky fans satisfied.

My apologies for this excessive review of rhetoric, it's uncommon I do altruistic activities like reviews, but it is culpable that the Child's Play films have been disowned and renounced as just that, child's play. Perhaps these avid horror/film fans and purists condemn what they can't interpret or are simply too inane and incompetent to fathom grandiose work, being oversimplified by lesser films of trivial pettiness.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this collection to all Child's Play and horror fans alike. Here's to the future exaltation of the impeccable grandeur of Child's Play and the struggle to dispose of those old DVDs.",1381536000,2,3562,4.853618421052632

5855348,4,B00DTPRYY8,"PLEASE NOTE!: This is my personal review and not a official review. When reading my review it may contain a few spoilers from the first 5 Chucky movies (not Curse of Chucky). My review is based on my personal thoughts but you be your own judge on the series and product.

I am really excited about this release as I have been a Chucky fan since I was three years old and the first one released on VHS (that's showing my age!). Chucky has always been a interesting horror series as this was the first horror series to take a doll and make him into a foul mouth killer. Child's Play open the door for many other toy killers such as Puppet Master, Dominic Toys, Dolly Dearest and others.

The first Child's Play movie kept you guessing and weather you believed Andy Barkley (played by Alex Vincent) that his Good Guy doll was really coming to life and committing murders.

The second Child's Play movie took it a step further and added more carnage and more scares. Chucky even takes us to his factory for the final scene. This was personally my favorite besides Child's Play one.

The third Child's Play movie felt it kind of dragged. I didn't like the whole military scenario but it gave us a look at how Andy Barkley grew up and the troubles he had to over come to get pass his horrible childhood (which won't stay dead).

Bride of Chucky introduced us to Tiffany, Charles Lee Ray's (Chucky) girlfriend before he was shot dead in the toy store. The two of them go on a rampage and this movie added a little humor.

Seed of Chucky was probably the worst out of them all (as many Chucky fans would agree) as it was too much of a comedy than being a dark-tone horror movie. Although we were introduced to Glen/Glenda it still couldn't make up for the lack of horror.

Finally we reach the sixth film, Curse of Chucky, which I am looking forward too. It takes us back to the original roots of Child's Play 1-3. There are many surprises (which I am not going to spoil for anyone, but if your curious just look up stuff on YouTube) in this film. From the things I saw, it looks to be a promising movie.

This collection of Blu-Ray movies has it's good and bad, which I will break down (PLEASE NOTE!: Again, this is my personal review and it's not an official review. So please take in what I say but you be your own judge on it).

The Good: The fact that all 6 films are in one set makes it easy to have the entire collection. In the set is Child's Play, Child's Play 2, Child's Play 3, Bride of Chucky, Seed of Chucky and the newest film Curse of Chucky. This is the first time that Child's Play 2 and Child's Play 3 have been released on Blu-Ray format, as they have always been released only on VHS or DVD Format. They also released with the movies audio commentary, the history of Chucky and Don Manici's work, deleted scenes, original trailers and more. The fact that this is also a limited edition set for only $58.99 (on Amazon) makes it worth the price.

The Bad: The only two things I can find disappointing in this set is Child's Play, Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky are the same features as they were released before. Child's Play features are directly from the 20th Birthday release and Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky are the directly from their original release. Child's Play 2 and 3 have no special features which is the other disappointing factor. In a interview with Don Manici (from Fear.net), he mentioned that he had video footage from the making of all the films that he wanted one day to release with the movies and he also had some fun moments with the cast. I think adding this to The Chucky Collection would have made a difference or giving the fans some new material that hasn't been seen on previous DVD/Blu-Ray releases. Child's Play 2 in my personal opinion, should come with deleted scenes (such as the clips that were from the made for TV version as majority of those clips were never put on to VHS or DVD).

My final thought: I think this is a great set for any fans of Chucky (like myself) or anyone who has never watch the Chucky series. If your expecting anything new from this box set, there's nothing really new except the new film Curse of Chucky and all of it's features, but if your looking to have the entire series and on Blu-Ray this is the perfect set.

By the way, can anyone guess what film the quote (in the title) is from?

This collection is a good way to own the Child's Play movies in one place. Child's Play is one of only four horror franchises to get a complete collection box set (Chucky fans should rejoice). Overall, the picture quality is good and the audio is great. My only complaint is that the older films haven't been remastered and this release offers fairly light bonus supplements overall (Child's Play 2 & 3 get only trailers). The total bonus content is only 141 minutes so it isn't a deluxe release.

In the original trilogy, Chucky was possessed by a serial killer and is much darker in tone then the later films (more horror, less comedy). He tries to kill Andy, his young owner, while torturing Andy's family. Part 2 features the beautiful Jenny Agutter (Logan's Run, American Werewolf in London). Part 3 stars a young Justin Whalin (Dungeons & Dragons) as Andy who is now a teenager in a military school. In Bride of Chucky, Chucky discovers the perfect mate to kill and revive into the body of another doll. In Seed of Chucky, Chucky (Brad Dourif) and Tiff (Jennifer Tilly) return, resurrected by their son (Billy Boyd). In Curse of Chucky, Nica begins to suspect that Chucky is responsible for her mother's mysterious death.

5855351,5,B00DTPRYY8,Childs play is my favorite horror movie series of all time. When I was little Chucky terrified me but not anymore. My favorite scene in the first movie is when Chucky pleads with Andy to save him and says we are friends to the end remember. Then Andy replies this is the end friend and lights Chucky on fire. I love chucky and her really is awesome.,1374192000,9,349,4.223880597014926
5855352,5,B00DTPRYY8,"You've always wanted it, you've always hoped it would happen, now Universal and MGM bring you Chucky: The Complete Collection on Blu-ray and DVD! For the first time in the US, all 6 films (from Child's Play to the all new, upcoming, highly anticipated, Curse Of Chucky) together at last and also marks the first time that Child's Play 2-Seed Of Chucky will be available on Blu-ray in the US. Now for the facts:

-The Child's Play disc will be the same one released by MGM a couple of years ago.
-Child's Play 2 and 3 will unfortunately be bare-bones (let's hope Scream Factory can get these 2 in the future)
-Bride and Seed Of Chucky will have it's previous extras ported over (save for the text-related extras also it's unknown if Seed Of Chucky will be Rated or Unrated or both)
-Curse Of Chucky is new and for those wondering; the disc in the set is the same one that will be released individually as a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack the same day (a DVD only edition will also be available).
-The DVD version will be the same discs released before (meaning Child's Play Chucky's 20th Birthday Edition, the original Universal discs of Child's Play 2, 3, and Bride Of Chucky, the Unrated Edition of Seed Of Chucky, and Curse Of Chucky which again, the disc is also available to buy either by itself or in a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack).

So in short, you should just get rid of Child's Play Blu-ray and get this set today because if you're looking into getting all the Child's Play/Chucky movies at once, then this is it!",1373587200,14,1509,4.5036496350364965

8597586,5,B00DTPRYY8,If you don't own any of the Chucky movies I definitely recommend on buying this boxset.  It's probably overall cheaper than buying the individual movies assuming you would want all of them.  All the discs are neatly organized within the case and easy to take out.  The case is decently sized and these DVDs are made quite well.  I would recommend this collection to anyone who is interested.,1518480000,,391,4.705882352941177
