8214233,2,B000UPGQQM,"I got this and thought that you can play it with one player, but you need two people or more to play it, as its a DVD game for a DVD player not a DVD rom pc game. Although I love to watch this game show, and laugh at the Whammies, I still miss Peter Tomarkin as he was a great guy and didn't make you feel bad if you got whammied. At least he warned you not to press your luck, and often read those funny poems at the end of the show sent in by fans.",1363219200,,450,3.6020408163265305

8214236,5,B000UPGQQM,"This is a very fun and entertaining game for DVD play. The game works great with my high definition DVD player but not so well on cheap DVD players. I really enjoyed this game a lot as well as my friends when we played it at a party. Brings back a lot of memories. Well worth the money, just remember it doesnt play well on cheap DVD players due to freezing at times. However, it worked fine on my HD player and on my DVD player in my PC and laptop.",1230076800,,449,3.9450549450549453
8214237,5,B000UPGQQM,I played this game with my family and we could not stop laughing. It is fun and really unpredictable as to what will happen. It really brings back memories from the TV show.,1202688000,,173,4.2727272727272725
8214238,1,B000UPGQQM,"Never before have I felt more ripped off when purchasing something. This game is flat out bad. It's not because of anything other than when you are at the board trying to win money. The problem with this is when you are waiting to stop the marker on a prize there are literally about 3 or 4 other markers. So when you stop you have no idea of which one you're actually stopping on. I can't believe they released this game like this. This was such a MAJOR bug! How could this get past the Quality Control testers? DO NOT BUY this game unless they fix this! The problem is, you'll never know if they did.",1195257600,4,602,4.198275862068965
