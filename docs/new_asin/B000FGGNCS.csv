If you or your children are not used to circuit training it can be difficult. You watch a child perform the exercise then you are on your own. I did not like the way you have to keep going back to the menu to start the next circuit. You get used to it.",1173312000,3,318,3.8923076923076922
8623652,5,B000FGGNCS,"I bought the Fantastically Fit Kids Workout for my son and daughter and they love it. My daughter likes the yoga portion more and my son likes both the resistance training and yoga. I like it because it's the first workout video for kids that doesn't just have  the kids jumping up and down for fun but has them do a real workout. I want my kids to have discipline not to think everything in life has to be complete fun. This video fits into the philosophy of what I teach my kids.  Don't get me wrong my kids do think it is fun too, but it's a real workout as well! Good job Fitness3.",1149724800,7,585,4.078260869565217
