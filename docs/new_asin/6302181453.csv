I have two VHS copies because I want them to last the rest of my lifetime. I'd rather have it in DVD, and I'd get two of those as well, but, sadly, it looks like it might get passed by to ever be put into DVD form. The movie is a great work of art.",1396915200,,390,3.949367088607595
7824733,5,6302181453,"Not posing as an 'art' movie, but everything an 'art' movie could be.  The mood is absorbing.  The impossibilities are engaging.  The music - 'Pistol Packin' Mama' and some seriously weird country thing presented as a recurring memory - is utterly transporting.  The girl is sufficient reason in herself.  The guy is cute.  The spirit is good.  This is the rare oddity that really works.",1230595200,,387,4.861538461538461
7824734,5,6302181453,"This is a surprisingly amazing film about a man and woman who fall in love with each other, and whose togetherness is so powerful it causes natural disasters and plagues.  The woman, played by Eszter Balint, can also be found in the must see Jim Jarmusch film ""Stranger Than Paradise.""  The filming style and acting style can be considered so bad its good, very much in the style of David Lynch's earlier films.  There are quite a few memorable lines, giving this film cult classic potential, if only more people would watch it.  There is also a scene towards the end of an apocolyptic twin towers which is quite lovely and strange, if that is of interest to you.  All in all, a must have that I fortunately stumbled upon in a dollar bin at a video store.  The average viewer will hate this film.",1052697600,,796,4.455172413793103
