8044899,2,B00076KZU2,"I bought this film because of Julie Christie, and like many of the films from the middle part of her career, was disappointed by her only brief appearance. There is not much to this film, beyond a few subplots involving car racing and a young man and his father in love with the same woman (Christie). I can empathize, but there are no remarkable or even slightly memorable performances, and the thin plot ends without really resolving anything. I take any opportunity I have to watch Julie Christie, but this film was unsatisfying in every aspect.",1152921600,,548,4.71875
