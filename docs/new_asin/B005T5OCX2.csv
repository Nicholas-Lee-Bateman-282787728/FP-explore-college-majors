8485904,1,B005T5OCX2,This was a cheap knockoff piece using actors instead of real people!!  The only picture of Taylor Swift was on the cover of the DVD!!  This DVD should be pulled from being sold by Amazon!!  I FEEL THAT I GOT CHEATED!!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!,1417910400,,244,4.239130434782608
8485905,2,B005T5OCX2,"I got this for my wife back in 2011...  well it found its way to the shelf and she forgot about it, however, when the cable and internet was out the other day she went to the DVD's and found this.  After about 30 minutes she came to me and said with a straight face ""I hope you didn't pay too much for that"".  Of course this is more of a question then a statement, thus assuming she was joking I smiled but she restated to ensure she was not joking.  We then had a laugh because she explained that this must have been done by an amateur so its not like it is awful but not worth more then the $4.23 that it is right now.  Although if you are going to spend $4.23 go to Redbox and spend $1.29 on the Lorax or Valentine's Day...  something else with Taylor Swift and pocket the rest of the money; you'll be far more entertained apparently.  To the person who made this: Good job!  TS is an awesome icon and has not given in to the smut!  I'm sure your next video could be better.",1392508800,,977,3.9948453608247423
8485906,5,B005T5OCX2,"I have received all three copies of Taylor Swift autobiographies on DVD, and I love them all. They all tell her story very well.",1381449600,,128,4.375
8485907,5,B005T5OCX2,I now know more about Taylor Swift! I enjoyed especially her younger years. I'll share it with my friends too.,1365033600,,110,4.55
8485908,1,B005T5OCX2,This is junk. There isn't even any Taylor footage in it. They use a bunch of stand-in doubles who don't even look like her. I threw it away. Waste of money. The Taylor picture on the cover is rip-off marketing deception. Who ever made this should be ashamed for being so under-handed. Don't buy it Swifties!!!,1362700800,4,309,4.535714285714286
8485909,4,B005T5OCX2,I liked it. It was informative about how Taylor began. I am disappointed it didn't have any interviews with Taylor. This makes it kinda fake with the actress that is playing Taylor.,1357084800,,181,4.6875
8485910,5,B005T5OCX2,"My daughter loves Taylor. This was a very informative picture, the actors were great. It gave her a better look into the creative process of Taylor Swift. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get to know more about Taylor Swift.",1325980800,5,244,4.6976744186046515
