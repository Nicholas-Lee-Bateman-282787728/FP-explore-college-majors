8289564,4,B001CUB3LW,"For those of us who enjoy history documentaries, the pleasures lie in trivia
picked up along the way. The HISTORY'S MYSTERIES documentary entitled
VIKINGS: Fury from the North has lots of interesting tidbits about a people
somewhat shrouded in myth, and almost a millenium remote from our times.

Two developments preceded the hundreds of years of invasion and conquest
from people living in areas we call Denmark, Norway and Sweden. These were
a global climatic warming that aided the increase in population of Europe's
northeast lands, also the invention of swift longboats, revolutionary in their
day.

The beginning of Viking invasions of Europe is often cited as the year 793, in
Lindesfarne, England. The 1066 Norman conquest of Britain is considered the
end of the Scandanavian Viking era, but it actually extends further at both ends.

Some trivia gleaned here:
The origin of the phrase, ""paying through the nose.""
Days of the week named for Viking Gods.
Details of the form of execution known as the ""Blood Eagle.""
How retired Vikings in the town of ""Jorvik"" occupied themselves.
King Alfred's Danelaw agreement with Norse occupiers.
Their lasting influence on the British legal system.
Year end holiday traditions that originated with the Norse.
What hastened the end of Britain's Viking Age.

A Viking called Rolf the Walker was too immense to ride a horse. His 911 attack
on the area now known as Normandy resulted in the first permanent Viking
colony in the lower continent. (Locals knew their conqueror as ""Rollo."")

Our general conception of Vikings in horned helmets is a myth created by
opera composer Richard Wagner.

In 865, two thousand Viking warriors gained control over the area of England
where York now stands. Explorations of their remains at York, originally the
Roman settlement of Emboracum, is a highlight of this 43 minute program.

There's much more, such as the travels of Eric the Red and his son, Leif
Erikson, also Viking settlements in the New World and traces of them that
have since been found, evidence of mating with Eskimo women, etc.",1447027200,2,2076,5.034985422740525
