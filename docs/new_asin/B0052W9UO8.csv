4531720,5,B0052W9UO8,"I did enjoy Vampire Knight Guilty so much. But I also love it too. I know that Kaname Kuran turned Yuki Cross into a vampire, by sinking his fangs into her neck. Yuki's real name is Yuki Kuran, she was born & raised by her real parents, Juri & Haruka Kuran. Her past memories returned when she turned into a vampire. She is a pureblood princess of the Kuran family. Anyways I loved the 2nd season of Vampire Knight.",1337904000,,415,4.265822784810126

4531722,5,B0052W9UO8,"The vampire knight series is wonderful. The voice acting at first in the first season is a bit rough to get used to if you're doing dub but it grows on you and before you know it, your so caught up in the story that its no longer a thought. This is the second season however and I must say, its much much better than the first season. Very suspenseful and more action. Gives you a more in depth feel to the anime and it leaves off with one hell of an ending. I doubt there will be a season three, but it leaves you wanting more so I hope there is. Won't be disappointed in adding this to your collection",1321315200,,603,3.9917355371900825
4531723,5,B0052W9UO8,"well, i happen to enjoy this series alot i watched it off of for shared, but i am merely curious about something. i am new to buying the actual series on dvd and i don't want to buy the japanese version though i do not mind reading subtitles if i have to. when it says dubbed it means in english right? so this particular dvd has english dub on it? pardon my ill knowledge on this i am just getting into anime, but i also do not wish to purchase something i cannot understand if there is an alternative. thanks :)",1320364800,,513,4.089108910891089
4531724,5,B0052W9UO8,"I bought my copy of Vampire Knight Guilty yesterday at Walmart. So glad to get it!  I was watching Vampire knight on Netflix but I enjoy watching this series so much over and over it was worth it to just buy it. I really don't mind turning the CD over to play it. Now I know that it is on both sides, it doesn't matter to me.  It works great just the same! The package it was purchased in was really nice too.",1317772800,,409,3.9156626506024095
4531725,4,B0052W9UO8,"I love Vampire Knight. I have ever since I saw it in the Japanese version; however, I do not like that it states complete series when it is not a complete series. Maybe the complete second season, but not the complete series seeing as the first thirteen episodes are not on here. Other than that I loved it.",1316822400,,307,4.310344827586207
4531726,2,B0052W9UO8,"This series was essentially ruined in how the hypocritical story turned out, and all the characters were ruined. It's not even all the story, the manga goes farther, and there is little explanation and much unrealism. Disappointed.",1309910400,,231,5.27027027027027

4531738,5,B0052W9UO8,"I love the series, but I don't like how you have to flip the one disk to get some of the middle episodes. That practice is a little outdated and I haven't seen it since I was still in my teens. Overall I think it is a great set.

4531740,4,B0052W9UO8,The only problem I have was how this item was produced.  These dvds are two sided. Therefore the dvd must be kept in the package in order for it not to be scratched. But sometimes no matter how hard we try they sometime get damaged or get smudged. I have had this set for several years since I have taken care of them they still play well.

4531752,5,B0052W9UO8,It doesn't matter what anyone think.  The anime was awesome.  The manga a little sad end it a little different but overall I still love it.  I'm a Kaname fan. The shipment was good dvd came in good shape.  They should make the complete anime series though.,1393804800,,256,4.382978723404255

4531762,5,B0052W9UO8,"Of course it helps that Vampire Knight is such a wonderful series itself, but the DVD is in great shape, arrived quickly, and has all the episodes and features it boasted.

The entire Season 2 is on there with some really neat cover art on the inside and outside of the case. It comes in Japanese with English subtitles and English dub (a relief if you're like me and had to watch the show on hulu the first time in only Japanese!).
I would recommend this purchase to anyone who is a fan of the series and would like it in his/her collection.

If you have not seen Vampire Knight before, please note that this is the SECOND SEASON. ""Vampire Knight: Complete Series"" is the first season. The show has adult themes but is safe for any child 13 and older. For me, this is one of the best revivals of the vampire saga I've seen in a long time. (""Twilight"" and others greatly pale in comparison.)

Hope you enjoy!",1374105600,2,908,4.329411764705882

4531764,5,B0052W9UO8,"Great story and good-looking likable characters that make you want to keep watching. It's a romantic vampire story with beautiful Gothic style artwork. There are vampire hunters and vampires with supernatural powers. I recommend giving this show a try, especially if you like vampire stories. This show is based on a manga series, which goes further into the story. I also recommend giving the books a try too.",1373155200,,410,5.044117647058823
4531765,5,B0052W9UO8,I love the Vampire Knight manga so watching the anime was a no brainer for me. It follows the manga pretty well and I wish they would make a third season.,1371340800,,154,4.0
4531766,5,B0052W9UO8,"I loved this anime!! I love vampires and this made me wanting more. This anime has a surprising twist to it, which I won't spoil the surprise.

Anyway, its an AWESOME anime in my opinion. :)",1370390400,,313,4.064516129032258

4531769,5,B0052W9UO8,I loved it the only problem is that if you want to watch episode 5-7 you have to turn the first disc over to watch them but everything else is amazing,1367280000,,150,3.870967741935484
4531770,4,B0052W9UO8,"This dvd series is the comeplete 2nd series of the vampire knight(if you don't have the first one, get that first or you'll be lost: Vampire Knight). Things are more fast paced, crazy and dangerous as Yuki's memories of her past become more intense and scary as she tries to remember her fragmented past. And the only person who really knows her past is Kaname and he's not telling. Zero's past comes after him as well as his twin brother shows up after the death of their parents years ago.
13 episodes comeplete this series and the only two issues I really have with this is that the 2nd four episodes are on the same dvd so you have to flip it leaving finger prints and possible scratches. And the ending left me a little bit unsatisfied and wondering.",1366848000,2,755,4.438848920863309
4531771,5,B0052W9UO8,"Probably my 2nd favorite anime series to date (Death Note comes first). I really loved the revelation about Yuki, even though it leads to some unfortunate implications. However, if you read the manga, even those implications are put to rest and you can watch this and just outright love it. Yuki's growth from scared little girl to a strong leader is amazing. Zero's self hate is finally put to rest, in a way, as he becomes the strongest vampire hunter in the world. Definitely watch this, preferably after watching the first set.",1366761600,,531,4.782608695652174
4531772,4,B0052W9UO8,"Everything is awesome but I dropped a star because I dislike that the first disc was made to be double sided, that and the fact that there isn't much other than the DVD case, DVD cover, and the 2 DVDs which amount to the last 13 episodes of the series..",1364947200,,253,4.08

I HIGHLY recommend this anime!",1362182400,,361,4.746031746031746

4531784,2,B0052W9UO8,"I normally do not bother rating but in this case, it is a warning.  The Vampire Knights and Vampire Knights Guilty are Seasons 1 and 2 and they are excellent as a series.  I watched it first on Hulu and liked it so much I bought the complete series of season 1 and 2.  HOWEVER, it is not complete!  As one other reviewer noted, it has 2 discs, the first going from Episodes 1-4 and the second one from Episodes 9-13.  It is missing the middle.  When you look at the discs sold separately, there's volume 1 (1-4), volume 2 (5-8) and volume 3 (9-13).  When I put the second disc into the player, it comes up as Volume 3.  What Viz did when they made this ""Complete Series"" is put disc 1 and disc 3 and called it complete.  It is not!  I thought maybe it was a fluke when it happenned on Vampire Knights Complete Series (which is the season 1 set) but when it happened exactly the same thing on this Vampire Knights Guilty Complete Series, I had to think it is a mistake that is done by the manufacturer.  If you happen to buy this and the same thing happens, you will need to buy the volume 2 separately or get a refund and get the whole series as individual discs.  Since it says on the cover that it  has 2 discs, either they manufactured it wrong or something is wrong with the Viz production end.",1354233600,29,1298,4.144
4531785,4,B0052W9UO8,"With Amazon having corrected the glitch which merged reviews of both parts of Vampire Knight, Guilty, the second limited series, can now be reviewed in it's own right.  Guilty hones the good elements of the first set and improves on them in almost every way.

Things begin with an uneasy truce between Kaname and Zero for Yuki's sake, and sure enough trouble finds it's way to Cross Academy in the form of the living being whom Zero hates most.  Even worse, an old enemy of Kaname, with the aid of a despicably dirty move against a Night Class member of Kaname's circle and help from Ichijo's slimy grandfather, arrives to tear down everything Cross Academy stands for.  Amidst personal dramas being played out, the war between the old school vampires and the human friendly Night Class is about to begin...

There is, of course, heavy duty drama between the primary Yuki-Kaname-Zero triangle, two of whom experience life altering events; but the supporting cast shines as well.  Events force Ichijo into a terrible balancing act between the interests of the two people closest to him, and it might be his surprisingly serious cliffhanging final scene more than anything else that will leave fans not familiar with the manga heading to their bookstores post haste to find out what happened next.  As in the manga, Yuki's relationship with Aido is a highlight, his empathy for her plight overriding his jealousy in proportion to her situation worsening. He eventually becomes the character who offers both Yuki and the audience some relief from the weight of her heavier relationships with Kaname and Zero.

The climax goes down slightly differently from how it did in the manga, but leaves the characters in essentially the same place.  Fans will, of course, want more; but if the anime is never continued it must be said that this wasn't a bad point to end it if it joins manga based anime that did not follow it's source material to it's conclusion.  Vampire Knight might not be high art, but Guilty does deliver the goods to fans who enjoy unabashed melodrama - and deliver them well.

I will end with a technical postscript alerting that, as with the first set, disk one is in an unusual double-sided format.",1347667200,2,2212,4.810026385224274
4531786,4,B0052W9UO8,Love it even more than season 1.  The ending is a little sad but good outcome. Hope Yuki and Zero will meet again.  Series 3 perhaps?,1347580800,,133,4.076923076923077
