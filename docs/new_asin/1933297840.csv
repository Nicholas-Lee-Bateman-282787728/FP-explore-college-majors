I have heard the CD format of this lecture many times. In it he makes no mention of orbs, does not time travel, and doesn't use the phrase ""wishes fulfilled"", which are all included in Dyer's book.
I loved this DVD. In fact, I have love all the published work of ""Doc"" that I could afford to get my hands on  -- about 45 lectures, special CD sets and all his books except the most recently released one.
Have been on a dedicated spiritual path for 25 years now, and Doc pulled all that I had read together and gave it greater meaning and understanding. What he offers that no one else has, in my experience, is how to avoid the pitfalls and make the greatest use of the time we have here. And so much more, including a great sense of humor!",1466208000,,951,4.2430939226519335

If one wants to believe it is a super natural thing go for it. The Title Wishes Fulfilled ---Reason for purchasing book. Was iterested in that part. Most of all---His going into hypnotic time traved----cinched it. I will continue to re read his earlier works. Do not plan to purchase any more of his books period............
