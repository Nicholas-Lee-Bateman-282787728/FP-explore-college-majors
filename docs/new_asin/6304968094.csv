7879805,2,6304968094,"This video talks a good hype, but has damn near nothing to back it up.  For instance, we only see and hear from Marcinko himself like three times. The sound quality is terrible.  I mean TERRIBLE!  We don't learn anything  that we didn't all ready know. Well, if you knew absolutely nothing about  Marcinko and Red Cell, then sure MAYBE you could come away with some new  information.  But for fans like me it is a total waste of time.  What  little video of the operations we do see is vague and doesn't show much of  their training.  Maybe their physical prowness.  Bottom line, read the  autobiography Rogue Warrior, you'll come away with a better sense of  everything Marcinko has done and will know infinitely more than this video  can teach you about Red Cell and it's mission.",943920000,17,782,4.565217391304348
