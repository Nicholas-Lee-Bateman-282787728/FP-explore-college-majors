8670946,5,B00M9HJRQK,"After reading the book ""Tracks"", I found it difficult to imagine anyone being able to transfer it effectively to cinema - well, it took them years to do it, but thankfully they've achieved what seemed almost impossible. I found ""Tracks"" to be a moving and extraordinarily beautiful film - not just in its transporting cinematography and stunning Outback landscapes, but beautiful for its truthfulness, its honesty. ""Tracks"" is both sublimely poetic and ruggedly authentic - it's emotionally raw. I didn't find one false note in the movie - no melodrama or stereotype characters that you see in most Hollywood films. Mia Wasikowska's performance demonstrates that old line from Keats, ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty"" - it's a great performance, the epitome of soulful. The journey is as much her character's internal coming to terms with herself and the world as it is the external experience, but nothing is spoon-fed to the audience. The film is psychological and spiritual and the landscapes and the actions reflect the central character's shedding of burdens and confronting herself in a naked environment - it's universal, but profoundly personal. One reviewer described it as ""achingly beautiful"", having now seen ""Tracks"", I feel that's an apt description. I think director John Curran and everyone involved in making the film has pulled off an extremely challenging project and have created something of lasting value.",1421366400,,1425,5.28193832599119

8670949,4,B00M9HJRQK,"Not sure why you can only buy an Italian language version of an English speaking film on Amazon but you can find the original pretty much everywhere else.  The English speaking version has a number of extras including interviews with the cast, the now an old lady real person (Robyn Davidson) this film was loosely based on, and others.  The interviews go for about as long as the film.  To be honest they get a bit boring after a while.  The film itself goes for 108 minutes.

This movie was shot in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.  The scenery along with actress Mia Wasikowska is the star.  There are a few other actors both animal and human in the film, especially at the start, but once she starts out on the journey walking from Alice Springs (which if you don't know is pretty much in the centre if you look at a map of Australia), via Ayers Rock to the Indian Ocean, Mia is pretty much the only person you see.  So scenery wise, you're in for a treat, with vast deserts, changing landscapes, and so on.  The film is set in 1975, is a little predictable as we know the real life person didn't die, although as Hollywood often does there are quite a few embellishments.

I thought that they could have started the journey a bit earlier in the film though.  The learning to train camels, getting ripped off by one employer and sort of treated like a daughter by another could have been lessened time wise and still had the same impact.  It seemed to be a lets listen to camels make noises over and over again at one point.

For a loner character I didn't really understand where the group of same aged people came from who suddenly visited her in the ruins she lived in one day, conveniently one of who was a photographer with links to National Geographic and other magazines.  The film did a poor job of explaining this and who these people were.  Did she once crave an active social life and ran away from it and these people were from her past along with some of their new friends who came along for the road trip?  Who knows.

This is a personal journey type film.  It's not an I have to cut my arm off, or fight a crocodile/poisonous snake to survive type film.  There's no major incidents in the film.  It's really an enjoy the scenery and couple of characters she meets along the way type experience.  In keeping with the authentic vibe of the film it does contain nudity, Mia Wasikowska for a short time, and the camels and dog were nude the entire time they were on screen.",1413504000,2,2501,4.38177874186551
8670950,4,B00M9HJRQK,"""Tracks"" (2013 release from Australia; running time: more on that later) brings the true story of Robyn Davidson trek across the Australian desert. As the movie opens, we are informed that it is ""Alice Springs, 1975"", when we see Robyn arrive, looking for work and starting preparations to make a 2,000 mile journey by herself from Alice Springs westwards to the Indian ocean. She decides to bring along several camels (to carry all her stuff) and her faithful dog Dig(gity). Robyn eventually takes a job in one of the local camel farms, so as to train on how to deal with camels. Two years later, on April 9, 1977, Robyn sets off on her journey with Dig and 4 camels. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, the movie is essentially a travelogue of the highest quality about life in Western Australia 40 years ago. The photography (by Mandy Walker) is the real star of the movie and in the movie End Titles, it is noted that the photography was ""inspired by Rick Smolan"". Second, Mia Wasikowska brings a tour de force performance as Robyn. She is in virtually every frame of the movie, and for long stretches there is little to no dialogue. So as to ""spice up"" things a bit, there are some trouble spots (for example, on Day 61 she wakes up to fins the camels are missing--now what?) but truth be told, there is little drama or tension. This is NOT a 'survival' movie, but a 'personal reflection' movie. In order to fund part of her trip, Robyn turns to National Geographic (by letter, from Australia, mind you), which eventually gives the green light, on one condition: one of their photographers will stop by on occasion to shoot pictures. That turns out to be Rick Smolan. He is played by Adam Driver in one of his most restrained performances. No antics a la the recent ""This Is Where I Leave You"" or ""What If""... There is a very nice (Windham Hill-reminding) soundtrack, composed by Garth Stevenson. Last but not least, about the movie's running time: several sources (including IMDb and Wikipedia) show it as being 112 min. but the version I saw this weekend was markedly shorter by I'm guessing 15-20 min. Could it be that the US distributor (The Weinstein Company) has cut the running time? It would be the first time Weinstein has resorted to this, feeling the need to 'dumb down' foreign movies for US audiences (Weinstein did it for Kon-Tiki a few years ago, cutting 30 min. from the original running time for the US release). If that is the case here again, shame on Weinstein!!

""Tracks"" opened without any pre-release hype or advertising at my local art house theater 2 weeks ago here in Cincinnati. I figured this likely will not be playing long so I went to see it right away. The matinee screening where I saw this at today was not very well attended, unfortunately. That's a shame, as this is a wonderful movie. Incidentally, later this Fall we get another movie with a very similar theme and storyline, ""Wild"", starring Reese Witherspoon, about a woman's solo trek in California. I'll be interested to see that one too. But in the meantime, I hope you will consider checking out ""Tracks"", be it in the theater, or on DVD/Bly-ray. you will not be disappointed. ""Tracks"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1413158400,5,3310,4.656410256410257
