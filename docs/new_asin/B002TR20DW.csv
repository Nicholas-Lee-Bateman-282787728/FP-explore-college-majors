8380493,5,B002TR20DW,"The music is beautiful, and haunting, as is the story.
Gene Tierney is like a gentle flower petal softly lingering in the Spring air. Randolph Scott is the tortured Southerner,
who lost the war and will lose the girl.",1419724800,,217,4.589743589743589
8380494,3,B002TR20DW,"Typically listed as a western, in large part for star Randolph Scott, this is one of those westerns-in-name-only; it's really a post-Civil War ""Gone With the Wind"" knockoff about feisty Confederate sympathizing beauty Belle Shirley (Gene Tierney), and the two men who vie for her affections, Union officer Thomas Crail (Dana Andrews) and and rebel Sam Starr (Scott). Guess which one she marries? Belle tries to keep her estate in Missouri going after the war, and when that fails, turns to raiding with the charismatic guerilla fighter Starr, hiding out in the hills as the reward on them keeps going up.

Like GWTW this is one of those southern-sympathizing films in which the slaves are happy and the masters kind (if patronizing), and the Confederate sympathizers noble and courageous while the Union men are - well, actually the Union men aren't so bad here; the real problems arise when Sam Starr recruits some no-accounts from Texas who are more interested in raping and pillaging than the Lost Cause.  Clint Eastwood's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Outlaw-Josey-Wales/dp/B006LMEDEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Outlaw Josey Wales</a>&nbsp;explored that area of the Civil War era much better, and it's not the only film that did so.  But it's clear that ""Belle Starr"" wants us to see the former slaveholders as noble and just, and that their ex-property regard them so, and that things would have been much better if not for those nasty Yankees, especially the evil unscrupulous raiders who profited after the war.  Anybody who has problems with the attitudes in the  much more famous Civil War picture of two years earlier, will almost certainly have the same issues with this one.

And ""Belle Starr"" doesn't offer the same film-making compensations that GWTW did. The story is laughable and not particularly well put together by director Irving Cummings and his crew, and the trio at the center of the story all contribute some of their less-distinguished performances. It's not so much that they're bored or boring, but that they all seem very one-note - ""hey Randolph, just be excited in this scene"", that sort of thing. Even the color isn't all that terrific though it's certainly serviceable enough. What it adds up to for me is a film that is definitely one of the weakest of the 60+ with Randolph Scott that I've seen, and probably the worst film of 1941 I've seen; for completists only.",1381881600,,2452,5.19493670886076
8380495,3,B002TR20DW,"I suspect this film is not in wide release for it's neutral to south-leaning on the civil war mostly.  There is also some racist dialogue common to some films of the times.  Most available prints I've seen have been fairly dark and it is good to verify quality on any purchase.  The story while mostly fiction is still a pretty interesting tale pulled from actual people and events.  Tierney's fairly weak early acting debut is saved by the performance of Scott and Andrews mainly and the usual added flair of Chill Wills.  The score and directing is pretty weak, but it is worth seeing if you can get a good print.",1346457600,4,615,4.504504504504505
8380496,3,B002TR20DW,"Belle Starr (1848-89) was the first of the female outlaws, and even to this date, more than a century and a half later, she heads up a very short list. Other female ""outlaws"" include Ma Barker and Bonnie Parker.

FWIW - I don't include such notable western gals as ""Big Nose Kate"", ""Calamity Jane"", ""Etta Place"" and ""Cattle Kate"" as these women were not really outlaws.

The film is not exactly up to historic standards, though it is true that Starr was from Missouri, was an expert sharp shooter, and eventually married Sam Starr (her second marriage, having already become an outlaw when married to her first husband). Her story was popularized in dime novels beginning in 1889 and in films beginning in 1928. She was played by Jane Russell in ""Montana Belle"" (1952), Elizabeth Montgomery in ""Belle Starr"" (1980), and Pamela Reed in ""The Long Riders"" (1980).

Beautiful Gene Tierney (1920-91) was nominated for an Oscar for ""Leave Her to Heaven"" (1944) and appeared in more than 40 films, the most notable of which were ""Tobacco Road"" (1941), ""Laura"" (1944), ""Razor's Edge"" (1946), and ""The Left Hand of God"" (1955). She was known for her escapades with famous personalities like Tyrone Power, Ally Kahn, and JFK.

Handsome Randolph Scott (1898-1987) plays Sam Starr. Scott started in silent films and made a name for himself in the 40s playing a variety of characters in a variety of films - ""My Favorite Wife"" (1940), ""To the Shores of Tripoli"" (1941), ""Captain Kidd"" (1945), ""Home Sweet Homicide"" (1946) - but by the 50s he was appearing exclusively in B westerns . He amassed a fortune from California real estate investments, and retired from film making because he considered his performance in ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) to be a good note to go out on.

Handsome Dana Andrews (1909-92) plays the Yankee Major who burns Belle's mansion and imprisons her brother. Andrews appeared in over 100 films, including memorable roles in ""The Westerner"" (1941), ""Ox Bow Incident"" (1943), ""Laura"" (1944), ""A Walk in the Sun"" (1945), and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946).

Chill Wills (1902-78) plays a member of the gang. He appeared in over 100 films, usually as the grizzled sidekick and occasional comic foil. He's best remember for his Oscar nominated role as Beekeeper in ""The Alamo"" (1960), but he also put in memorable performances as Uncle Bawley in ""Giant"" (1956) and the storekeeper in ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973).

Shepperd Strudwick (aka John Shepherd) plays Belle's brother. He made dozens of films in the 30s and 40s and then transitioned to TV where he was nominated for 2 daytime Emmys for ""Love of Life"" (1951) and ""One Life to Live"" (1968).

Louise Beavers (1902-62) plays Belle's servant. She appeared in more than 100 films from 1923 to 1960 and is probably best known for her role in ""Imitation of Life"" (1934) and for her TV show ""Beulah"" (1950-3).

Irving Cummings (1988-1959) directs. He was a popular actor in the silent era and also worked as a director, making westerns and light hearted comedies. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""In Old Arizona"" (1928).

The NY Times called it ""a stange melange of Technicolored fuss-and-feathers"" and ""a pompously operatic fiction,"" although they did note that ""Here and there the film comes to life.""

Popular westerns of the 1940s often focused on the gunfighter or the outlaw - ""The Return of Frank James"" (1940), Gary Cooper's ""The Westerner"" (1940), John Wayne's ""3 Godfathers"" (1948), ""Dark Command"" (1940) with John Wayne and Roy Rogers, ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946) with Gregory Peck, John Ford's ""Ox Bow Incident"" (1943), and Howard Hughes' ""The Outlaw"" (1943). Though there were exceptions -  Fritz Lang's ""Western Union"" (1941) with Randolph Scott, John Ford's  ""My Darling Clementine""  (1946), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), and John Wayne's ""Red River"" (1948) - the focus on the outlaw in Westerns mirrored the focus on the gangster in crime dramas.

1941 was a terrific year for films - ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", Sergeant York"", ""How Green Was My Valley"", Meet John Doe"", ""Buck Privates"", ""They Died with Their Boots On"", ""The Sea Wolf"" ""High Sierra"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", and ""A Yank in the RAF"". The big Oscar winner was ""How Green Was My Valley"" (Director, Picture, Supporting Actor)

This is a pretty ordinary film, but the ending is particularly good albeit sentimental.",1325980800,2,4414,4.912634408602151
