5666121,5,B00BQI493O,"What a beautiful documentary It was one of the best I have ever seen! It was so heart warming and at the same time.it made you so mad at what they put her through. You will want to carve out some time because you can't stop watching. Robin and her family went through so much to find a better life the things they experienced,  I don't think I could have survived what happened to them. I am in awe of them.

5666147,5,B00BQI493O,"This film was a pleasure to watch. It was inspirational to see people with so many challenges remain positive throughout. The three principles encounter problem after problem and deal with life as it comes. There are struggles, hurt feelings, unkind words, not to mention sexual abuse, substance abuse, misogyny, institutional victimization. I wonder how many others have been victimized by a tribal government in the same way? I have always believed that Native Americans should enjoy an autonomous, self governance. Since white people conquered and decimated the indigenous population, it's only fair that we give them this basic right. Now, I can't help but wonder if that is a mistake? These self governing Tribal Counsels seem to go unchecked. I realize no system is perfect but the Native American organization in this film seems to lie, cover up sexual abuse, and return the victims to the arms of the perpetrator. It's eerily similar to the Catholic Church scandals. The thing that makes this film worth watching is the bright spirits of the three main characters. That spirit breaks through over and over as they struggle through life, loving and supporting each other every step of the way. It just goes to show, where there is love, there is always hope. Everyone should see this film.",1419638400,,1296,5.032558139534884
5666148,3,B00BQI493O,Difficult to watch this woman's repeatedly poor choices combined with poor options place her children in danger and in the custody of a incestuous pedophile.  Unfortunately her story is all to common on 'The Rez'.  It would have been good if this documentary had exposed more about the corruption/lawlessness of the Tribal government.,1417564800,,334,5.283018867924528
5666149,4,B00BQI493O,"The very feat of following this woman and her family for several years, in a well controlled, yet sympathetic and enlightening
story is impressive, and I congratulate David Sutherland. The coverage of the cross-border difference in jurisdictions and accommodations are skillful, and seem epitomized by the colorful passages of the railways and other vehicle traffic through the seasons. The sounds of Native rhythms,vocalizations, and songs, along with modern country music help viewers knit the protagonist's lives with their own memories.

The long-term concentration on this kind-hearted woman and her growing children with their various problems, results in an unusually frank examination of a culture that many of us may be far too quick to simply dismiss as alien or hopeless.
I was inspired by her openness and determination to rise up and take some control of her life, and I learned from her determined manner despite sudden setbacks, about her courage and humility. I also began to understand the pathway that women who hope to arise above such daunting problems, are counselled to follow,  as well as something of the vocabulary in which these events can be discussed,",1417564800,,1179,5.26595744680851

5666152,3,B00BQI493O,The subject is very interesting.  The way the story was told was not very good. Maybe some narrative explaining what was going on might have helped.  Since I am ignorant of Indian affairs I was confused as to why the subject's life was so hindered by the Indian authorities.,1415059200,2,274,4.571428571428571
5666153,5,B00BQI493O,This is an excellent documentary of the devastation of rape of an early age.  Alcohol and bad relationships are part of the coping that some people go through to avoid.  It was great to see the different healing stages she went through and to see her blossom.  I work at a Rape Crisis Center and I would encourage victims and their families to see this as there is hope for those needing healing from rape and addictions.  Most addictions are a result of past traumas.  I am surprised that the tribal elders were not supportive but am glad that she did not stop there.  Kuddos!  Great documentary.,1415059200,2,597,4.5233644859813085
5666154,5,B00BQI493O,"The story in ""Kind Hearted Woman"" shows how a woman can suffer sexual abuse during her childhood thus leading to drug addition in adulthood as well as more sexual abuse.  It also shows how a strong woman can over come the past and become a wonderful mother.",1413244800,2,257,4.468085106382978

5666167,5,B00BQI493O,"A poignant, well shot film of a far too often untold story of human indignity, suffering, struggle and strength of spirit.

5666170,5,B00BQI493O,"Found myself horrified at the way the courts, social services and people in authority abused their powers and were never reprimanded for it. How they destroyed her life and her childrens because someone didn't like her. Story is very well explored but would have like to seen the courts stand up and do the right thing.

Watched both parts of this story and found myself respecting this womans courage and her love for her children. Even though her own problems are explored - alcholism she triumphed. The more the powers to be tried to destroy her - the stronger she became.",1404172800,4,575,4.693069306930693

5666172,4,B00BQI493O,Very personal documentary. Really opens your eyes to abuse and the ways to look out for abuse. Shows the hard choices a mother has to make for her children.

She is a re-covering alcoholic and is trying to rebuild her life.  You follow her as mistakes are made and different paths are taken.

5666231,5,B00BQI493O,"This documentary is an accurate portrayal of the challenges of Native American people.  It was very hard to watch sometimes, because life is such an uphill battle.  The generational dysfunction of alcoholism, child neglect, abuse and poverty seem insurmountable, and yet this family keeps working, keeps trying.  Their courage and perseverance keep my hope alive.",1389484800,3,363,5.5636363636363635
5666232,2,B00BQI493O,"At best, this is a depressing portrait of the blind leading the blind. A low point in said portrait comes when a mother gives her daughter a talk about ""boundaries"" while a camera snuffles its snout around the daughter who takes the only available avenue of retreat by hiding her head in the crook of her elbow.

At worst, this protagonist comes across as eerily reminiscent of Norma Khouri, the protagonist of the documentary ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Lies/dp/B003VSM4QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Lies</a>"" directed by Anna Broinowski. Although I make this comparison, I don't discount entirely Robin's allegations of sexual abuse of herself or her daughter. (Forbidden Lies also reveals an odd dynamic between father and daughter.) But Robin's actions suggest other troubling issues at work under the story of a strong, smart woman struggling against the odds.

For example, why give joint custody of their children to a man who she believed was capable of killing her? Perhaps because it suited her plan to go back to school. Her concerns about her children's needs for stability as she fights for sole custody become little more than platitudes when she goes on to drag them back and forth across the U.S./Canadian border, with little thought to their schooling needs, because it suits her need for a romantic relationship.

In general, her mothering style often seemed emotionally invasive, and conflated with her own need to maintain her self identity as someone who speaks up about sexual abuse and domestic violence. Her self-proclaimed expertise in talking with kids about sexual abuse, seemed at odds with her failure to break the pattern of verbal abuse from her daughter towards her younger brother. It is beyond me to say whether these arise as an effect of editing or the actual relationships.

Either way, I was left with the queasy feeling that this documentary (and myself as a viewer) are caught up as ""perpetrators"" in the continued cycle of human suffering.",1383091200,9,2043,5.3354037267080745
5666233,4,B00BQI493O,This was a must see for me. I feel compelled to share this story with everyone that I know. I recommend it to everyone.,1379894400,3,119,4.0
5666234,5,B00BQI493O,"This is a brave, poignant portrayal of a strong woman.

5666235,5,B00BQI493O,Everyone who knows a person who is victimized by or has escaped from domestic or sexual violence (and that is a vast majority of the population) should take time to watch this video.
