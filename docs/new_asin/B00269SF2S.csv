3853233,3,B00269SF2S,"This theatrical version of Ibsen's play ""An Enemy of the People"" is faithful to the Arthur Miller adaptation, and features a solid starring performance by Steve McQueen.  Characteristic to McQueen, his Dr. Stockmann is underplayed but still convincing.  Charles Durning is excellent as town mayor and Dr. Stockmann's elder brother.  Only wrong note is Bibi Anderson's shrill Mrs. Stockmann (Dr. Stockmann's wife).  Film has a claustrophobic feel, perhaps intentionally?  On the expensive side but at least it is available on DVD.  Recommended to Steve McQueen fans.",1272067200,2,565,5.511627906976744
3853234,2,B00269SF2S,"This play was written in 1882 to put on display the irrational responses of the public masses. It can be viewed as a comic-drama because the subject matter is serious but the reaction by the people of the town is ridiculous. So the subject matter is interesting and timeless. But I have to disagree with other reviewers, and I have to say this is far from Steve McQueen's best acting.

In fact it almost seems like he has the least amount of lines in this presentation, far fewer than some of the other characters. He certainly has the least interesting and least passionate ones. It's almost as if McQueen is always standing somewhere in the scene while other actors are doing all the talking and acting. In fact, I was more impressed with the supporting cast, in particular Charles Durning, who took the place of the actor who never showed up for the part of Peter Stockman, the town's Mayor. Durning, by the way, has a great biographical story that should be made into a film but I digress. McQueen wanted his wife, Ali McGraw, to take the part of his wife in the play also. Thank god she didn't. Bibi Andersson does a fine job as the concerned and worried doctor's wife.
 As far as McQueen's acting skills on display here, he seemed to deliver his lines without any intensity or passion. One example was when his family's house gets pelted with rocks. The windows get broken, his family is freezing and terrorized. What is his response? He goes around the house picking up the rocks from under the bed and other furniture and tells his wife to save them for his son as a reminder of this day. If Steve used this play to prove his acting ability to his friends, he certainly chose the wrong character to portray. He should have played the conniving town Mayor. Though it's an interesting play, after it is over you ask yourself where was Steve McQueen?",1270339200,,2971,6.716883116883117
3853235,5,B00269SF2S,"Enemy of the People was a financial failure, as I recall it did not have an audience and was yanked from distribution. However, I saw the film for the first time at the American Film Institute in Kennedy Center in the late seventies.  Here's the rub: there was a standing ovation when the film ended!  So what if McQueen fans and general audiences couldn't accept him as Ibsen's hero Dr. Thomas Stockman, it's still a powerful film. Although originally written in the 18th century, there are many parallels in today's world and lessons to be learned from this story if one is open enough to absorb them.

3853237,5,B00269SF2S,"Both James Daly's (black & white) and Steve McQueen's (color, also supplied directly by the Warner Brothers Shop) portrayals are based on Arthur Miller's splendid adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's powerful drama.  Miller streamlines the story, removes or updates what today would be quaint, and masterfully intensifies the timeless nature and impact of this great theatre.  But that's where the similarity ends.  Alexander Jacobs' thrilling screenplay is superior to the Daly production. George Schaefer's superb directing, and what might well be the greatest acting performance of Steve McQueen's life, also give this movie a pure heroic sweep that excels over the less inspiring Daly production.  In fact, the Daly show feels only acted, whereas the McQueen film feels real.

The earnestness of this film is created by McQueen's dedicated portrayal, as well as by stunning and chilling performances by Charles Durning and Richard Dysart - just to name a few of the first-rate realizations by all.  These achievements make this film the first-choice and a must-have for any admirer of great dramatic art.

3853238,5,B00269SF2S,"I won't pretend to be an Ibsen scholar.  I bought this film because I'm a Steve McQueen completist.  McQueen may not have been one of the most demonstrative actors but he rarely, if ever, embarrassed himself on screen and chose his roles well.  ""An Enemy of the People"" was a labor of love for McQueen.  Initially completed in 1977 it didn't see the light of day until 1979 and just barely.  As I recall, it played at one theatre in Philadelphia and probably for only a week.  To my mind the film's commercial failure doesn't lie at the feet of McQueen but the marketing honchoes at Warner Brothers.  Poetic justice has been served as such that Warners has included it with the series of Archive films they've just released.  The story is fairly simple.  An altruistic doctor(McQueen) discovers that the man-made springs that have been constructed in his hometown are poisonous.  Such a discovery would make him a hero you would think.  Through villainy and duplicity by the town elders, notably the spineless editor of the local paper(Richard Dysart) and particularly the spiteful mayor(Charles Durning) who happens to be his brother they manipulate the situation and turn the doctor into a pariah.  Justice is served to a degree in the end but not how you would expect it.  The film feels like a filmed stage play so maybe it's true venue is the small screen where it's intimacy plays well.  The ensemble work here is top-notch notably Durning and Dysart.  This is a film I heartily recommend and deserves a second life.",1248998400,25,1522,4.755725190839694

3853279,5,B00269SF2S,Not many wanted to touch this project so McQueen became its executive producer as well as the star. It's a classic morality tale of doing what is right even when it costs everything.,1360627200,,182,4.545454545454546
3853280,5,B00269SF2S,"This is an update/adaptation of Ibsen's classic drama.  It deals with Aristotle's ethical dilemma&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aristotle-s-Ethics/dp/0631159460/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aristotle's Ethics</a>, i.e., when faced with a choice between two courses of action, either of which will injure a particular group, which do you choose?  A large part of a town's income is from a local spa, a facility that draws visitors to the town to ""take the waters.""  A local doctor discovers the waters have become polluted.  What should he do?  If he fails to report it, unknown strangers visiting the spa may become ill.  If he reports it, shutting down the spa, it will have a serious impact on the local economy.  His medical ethics cause him to choose the second course of action, and he is villified by the townspeople who label him an enemy of the people.

Ibsen's play illustrates the consequences of taking a course of action, even if you feel that morally you are doing the right thing, but the right thing for whom.  It raises a question for discussion, i.e., could the doctor have handled things differently.  It is a production that should be viewed by university students, particularly students in technical areas.",1355356800,,1269,5.428571428571429
3853281,2,B00269SF2S,"I'm a huge fan of Steve McQueen and have been working my through all of his 30 or so films. AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE was one that I have hesitated to see. I knew from McQueen's picture on the cover of the DVD and from the storyline that this would be a drastic deviation from a typical Steve McQueen film.
AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE was one of the last few films in McQueen's amazing career. He had done it all already and had created his macho ""cool"" image. This film must have been a labor of love since it was so completely non-Steve McQueen. The film goes against any role McQueen had ever played It's hard to recognize Steve McQueen under the huge beard and wild mane of long hair and glasses. Steve McQueen was known for saying little in his movies and for speaking words with his eyes and facial expressions. Here is a movie where his face is hidden and he actually gives speeches and relies on dialogue to tell the story.
Although set in the 1890's in Norway (althought the country is never mentioned), the story stands the test of time. A town's prosperity depends on the healthful and rejuvenating mineral spring waters that bless the town. Soon the town will be famous for it spa waters--well, until the local doctor (McQueen) learns that pollution from a tannery has turned the water toxic. This Henrik Ibsen play was adapted for American audiences by Arthur Miller and brought to the big screen by Steve McQueen.
Unfortunately the film does not bring the story to life and AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE best remains a theatrical production. Seeing it on screen adds little to the sad story. The scenery is dark and dismal and there is an amazing lack of color and vibrance. Of course, this is a dark story that pits right against wrong. McQueen's character tries to convince the town that in a democracy, the majority are not always right.
It's a disappointing film but I applaude Steve McQueen for trying to change his image. I've heard that this picture was never released or released very briefly and not really available until decades later on DVD. I can imagine studio executives were jittery seeing Steve McQueen unrecognizable and in a morality play.",1345420800,2,2157,4.576227390180879
3853282,3,B00269SF2S,"Hooray for Mr. Steve McQueen...daring to play such a wonderful role. Truly great. It seems now Warner Bros.want their money back that they lost. Well I got my dvd..thankyou...I remember Mr. Mcqueen's famous line in the movie. When the people were saying  that the water's okay...and Mr. Mcqueen fires back in bringstone...
""WAS THE MAJORITY RIGHT WHEN THEY CRUCIFY OUR LORD?"" He was great. A small movie...but for me a enjoyable movie. You would never see the stars today challance themselves like Steve McQueen did. It's all in ""GIVE ME THE BIG ROLE & BIG CHECK.
Sadly...Mcqueen's dream was to make a racing movie. Which he did. LeMANS!.but fell at the box office. Same with John Wayne...his dream to make ""THE ALAMO""it also fell at the box office. BUT both were happy they did it their way. Now both movies are very big.
Everything today is actors hanging around on wires with a blue screen....or guts thrown at you in the movies. Four letter words like it's the right thing to say all the time. Where has the goodness gone with good family movies?Until the late 1960's we didn't have a movie rate. Now it's  family cartoons rated PG or PG14..no reason for that at all.

3853283,5,B00269SF2S,"I had heard of this film in the 1970s when it was out in theaters for about 2 seconds.  I've seen it twice and disagree with any who give it a negative review.  The original play by Henrik Ibsen was first presented in Oslo in 1883.  Almost 130 years later, it is still extremely relevant.  Corporations doing everything they can to maximize their profits and never mind the consequences.  Government officials going along with what the corporations want.  The more things change, the more they remain the same.

Steve McQueen's performance as the idealistic doctor Thomas Stockmann is reminiscent of his portrayal of the bounty hunter Josh Randall in ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"", one of the best TV westerns and right up with many of the best TV dramas.  It's not an over the top, chew the scenery performance.  Rather it is a performance that fits the character perfectly, a calm man of science and medicine who has the temerity to believe that the people of his town will back him in exposing the truth about their polluted (and profitable) therapeutic springs.  As is the case with his Josh Randall character, McQueen often uses a look combined with body language to convey powerful emotions.

There are many bad movies that are popular for reasons which defy understanding.  This is a very good movie that should appeal to anyone who appreciates nuanced acting.",1324771200,,1361,4.818965517241379

3853285,4,B00269SF2S,"The water may be poison... but this little known gem of a film is not.  There is much to recommend it:  a gripping play written by Ibsen in 1882, updated some by the pen of Arthur Miller, the story has as much resonance and meaning for today as it did, presumably, in 1882 - if not more so!  The plot is fairly simple on the surface, but there are profundities in its depths that will leave one thinking long after seeing the movie.  It is a set-bound piece (after all, it was originally a play) but you still feel the cold and see the snow outside as it falls...and having the story confined to interiors only adds to its sense of physical cold and eventual and unexpected emotional isolation.

Steve McQueen gives an incredibly subtle performance.  It is an exceptionally smart performance.  In this film he completes the arc of his range:  as Dr. Stockton he is a matured, buried-in-hair, bespectacled ""Steve"" - the character from McQueen's first starring role in THE BLOB.  Both characters are desperate to tell and convince the majority of townsfolk of a horrible and monstrous truth.  In THE BLOB we have McQueen convincingly playing a desperate-to-communicate teen (even though he was in his twenties, much like Dean's REBEL being a teenager, even though Dean was also early twenties) -and in ENEMY we see the matured, subdued, philosophic character attempting to get his message across.  And between these two films that practically bookend the actor's career we have - amongst so many other performances - Vin, the Josh Randall extension in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.  We have Hilts in THE GREAT ESCAPE, as cool on his motorcycle as was Vin and Randall on their horses.  And then seemingly out-of-nowhere comes a beautifully comedic and dramatic role as Eustis Clay in the exceptional, also overlooked film SOLDIER IN THE RAIN. Then there is the romantic turn in LOVE WITH THE PROPER STRANGER.  The best performance (the only one for which he was nominated for an Oscar) was as Jake Holman in THE SAND PEBBLES: a perfect hybrid of action hero and philosophic pawn. Then came a host of ultra-cool roles - BULLITT, THOMAS CROWN, Doc in THE GETAWAY.  Anyway, the point is that McQueen had much more range than he is largely given credit for.  And this quiet drama with its loud repercussions proves it!

The entire cast is pitch perfect.  The Leonard Rosenman music score is truly lovely.  The movie belongs on every movie-lovers - and McQueen lovers - shelves.

Speaking of shelves...Warner Brothers - when the picture first came out - got scared of some of the harsh reviews and therefore shelved the film.  It was the only McQueen film to never be officially released. It was - in the word's of McQueen biographer Marshll Terrill ""The most notoriously shelved film of the decade.""  Well, wrongs can be righted - so I am glad that Warner Brothers has released this taut treasure as part of its Archive Collection.  I now have several titles from the WB Archive Collection.  Most of the films are very much better than most of today's films given the deluxe double-disc, director's cut, blu-ray special boxed treatment.  But why can't the folks at the Archives put just a few bucks in creating a menu page with chapter stops for these films?  By not doing so, it almost seems as if the Archive folks are ashamed of the product.  Anyway - despite none of the Archive films having menus or extras (as far as I know from the DVDs I have) - we should be glad that they are at least on durable disc and not on prone-to-tangle tape that no one bothers to watch anymore because it has been pushed aside same as cassette tapes and before that vinyl LPs.

And if it was an issue in 1882 - the water being poisoned - how much truer it is today after the Gulf spill and the Japanese quake's nuclear meltdown and lord only knows what else is silently dooming us or being kept from us.  The world needs more Doctor Stockman's if we are to survive.  At least we have one in this movie, even if he is ""an enemy of the people.""",1307491200,11,4014,4.60478199718706

It took great courage and a real inner passion for McQueen to make this movie, at this particular time in his career. He had gone 'within' during the four year gap between Towering Inferno, and this movie, and this is what he came out with. The style in which ""Enemy"" was made could be off-putting for those who are used to seeing McQueen, the hero, the winner, behind the wheel or atop a horse, out in the wide open spaces. It was directed by George Schaeffer, an award winning theater director, filmed in a somewhat two dimensional studio, black and white theatrical style and the entire cast ate the scenery. The story? That's the rub. Ibsen, wrote this almost a hundred years ago, and it's such a story for our times, it's stunning! ""The water is poisoned!"" Steve McQueen was a visionary in terms of what was and is occuring in our environment. There's great soul in this film and just to get it released Steve had to make a reluctant deal with the studio. Watch for the speech he gives, ""It takes fifty years for the majority to be right, and then the majority is never right."" It's chilling. This is a film your children should see. It makes a statement of values, courage and conviction.",1289001600,10,1357,4.453815261044177

I can't think of any other reason that drove Steve to want to do An Enemy Of The People except to prove, maybe to himself to start with, and maybe to the public too, or to Hollywood, that he was more than just the physical type.
This Production has the look and feel of a B Movie, perhaps it unknowingly is, that's all for the viewers' interpretation, but then would an actor of Steve McQueen's status possibly be in a B Movie?  I don't think he would be, would he?  He was too big.  So the question remains, what was the true scale of this Production?  My interpretation of it is rather small, but I can't provide sufficient evidence to back up the suggestion I've implied, the whole scenario was a bit odd, but whatever the films' place in the industry and it's credibility also, it's not the worst film you'll ever see.",1279584000,,1092,4.5126903553299496

Got the money, and did just that...applying his own make-up.

And he nailed it.

Too weird for most movie-goers (and Warner Bros.) to deal with...although Warners did try.

Watch the movie to see  what happens to Steve McQueen and the towns people..",1459814400,,316,4.448275862068965

8352430,3,B00269SF2S,Well there's a reason this is probably McQueen's least known work. Sat on the shelves for 2 years as somebody tried to figures out how to get the public interested in a stage-bound set full of phony snow being preached to about the dangers of careless big business and corrupt turn of the 20th century politicians. What saves this film from rubbish is McQueen's sincere performance and the ensemble of other talented actors who are really selling this for what it's worth.,1445990400,,472,4.7682926829268295
8352431,3,B00269SF2S,"I could not get into this movie. I have seen better Steve M., so I just did not finish it. It moved very slowly, I did not share his feeling about the movie in the first place and I could not understand why all the hair! He had odd opinions of movies he wanted to do & some turned out badly...certainly not up to what he thought. His keen acting skills are not to be ignored & he usually had the ability to decide what was for him & how to present it but I sincerely feel his lack of education played a big part in that. I agree with him about too much dialogue & he sure had the face to use his expressions instead of words but we all know John Wayne was the master in that area.",1440374400,2,680,3.8642857142857143
