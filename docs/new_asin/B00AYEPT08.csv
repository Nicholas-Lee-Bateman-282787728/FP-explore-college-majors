5528289,5,B00AYEPT08,"At first I was hesitant to check this series out, but all of my friends swear by it, so, I figured I'd give it a whirl and wow, it really is a good show and trust me I am not into vampires like some are. Good solid acting, good story lines, good for adults and young adults, and keeps you interested. Most vampire tv shows seem to follow a script of how the movie should go and that's why I had never been a huge fan of vampire series. But this one is definitely worth a shot!",1393977600,5,476,3.917525773195876
5528290,5,B00AYEPT08,"I tried one disc to make sure it would play... so far so good. For the price I was only expecting the episodes, but there are special features also...I love the show. 4 seasons on blu-ray for $50ish is a bargain.",1393372800,4,212,4.195121951219512

5528293,5,B00AYEPT08,"My best girlfriend got me hooked on them. She kept telling me about them, and now I got my 2 little sisters on it too.",1391990400,3,118,3.76
5528294,5,B00AYEPT08,"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my wife. She loves the show and I wanted to get her every season that was available without spending a fortune. This was a great deal but I was concerned that since it was an import, the discs might not work in the U.S. But they work great. No issues.",1391385600,8,293,4.068965517241379
5528295,5,B00AYEPT08,"This box set was a gift for my mom.  She opened it on Christmas Eve and she nearly screamed when she saw what it was.  That's the reaction you look for during Christmastime and the gift-giving season.  She adores the show just as many other people do.  The  box set has the first four seasons, including all the episodes plus all the expected extra.  No complaints here.",1389657600,7,370,4.447761194029851

5528298,4,B00AYEPT08,"This was a birthday gift for my wife. The set is from Ireland but works fine in US players. My wife was VERY EXCITED to see this set on her birthday! And the price is incredible! The set arrived in time and the box it arrived in was in good condition. The ONLY issue...when my wife unwrapped and took each season out of it's sleeve, the blue jewel case that holds the discs in place were broken in places. Season 1 was fine, but seasons 2-4 each had a few small slivers of blue plastic fall out. The discs are fine and as far as I know all play fine. She watched the entire 2nd season over the Thanksgiving weekend and is already on Season 3. Great deal!",1417651200,,654,4.1171875

5528302,4,B00AYEPT08,"After four or five years of avoiding this series I ended up watching the first few episodes in a moment of boredom and, after four or five episodes (once you get past the ""Dear Diary"" crap) it quickly becomes one of the most interesting series on TV right now.

5528315,5,B00AYEPT08,"I live in the U.S, and I thought this wouldn't work in my bluray. It said all regions or multi regional, but It said it should work in the USA. Guess what!? IT DID!!! I love it. It saves you money instead of buying each season individually. You save about $50 when you buy this product than the other choice.

8559193,5,B00AYEPT08,"As a 58 yr. old man, I am not ashamed to admit that this is one heck of a show. I am naturally a vampire fanatic so needless to say that I also enjoyed the ""Twilight"" saga. My son warned me it was going to be a tennie bopper series or ""Chic flick"" sort of thing. So I went ahead and bought the first 6 seasons despite of my sons warning. Let me tell you, I was hooked from disk1, season 1. True it is a romantic story but there is a lot more to the story that keeps you on edge. Even guys will enjoy it, I know I did. Right now I am watching season 3 and I called in sick so I could enjoy the show. Trust me this is a great show you will not regret this purchase",1442966400,,662,3.6690140845070425
