8257944,5,B00158UOA2,"Is this a faithful adaptation? Sorry, not completely. But there are worse in this series as being unfaithful (e.g. Third Girl, Murder on the Orient Express, Appointment With Death).

The oddball part of this is how Poirot ends up in the right spot as all the suspects -- first at a birthday party for the soon-to-be-victim, then on the Blue Train where the murder takes place, then at a place on the Riveria owned by one of the suspects, and of course they all get back on the train for the cliched revelation in front of all the suspects (which didn't happen in the original novel, by the way). The other distracting thing are the obvious commercial breaks.

However, I enjoyed the casting. Eliot Gould is the big name, and he did decent. Better were the roles filled by James D'Arcy, Lindsay Duncan, and Georgina Rylance. But for me, it was a pleasant surprise to see one of my favorite actors I rarely see: Nicholas Farrell, who played Aubrey Montague in Chariots of Fire.

I did find this an interesting retelling of the story, and I would recommend it.",1340582400,,1057,4.582010582010582
8257945,5,B00158UOA2,"This is another Poirot adventure where the Belgian detective needs to solve who murdered a woman; however, since the woman's face was viciously disfigured, he also needs to discover who the woman is. The murder occurs on the Blue Train among several socialites. These include the supposed murdered woman who, against her father's advice, takes a very expensive jewel with her during this vacation. The jewel has a history of bringing disaster to its owners. The jewel is missing after the murder. This woman also brings along her husband who has been mistreating her and who she wants to divorce, and her lover, a friend of her husband. Her husband, a poor man, owes her lover a great deal of movie that he won from him by laying cards. She is also accompanied by her maid. The woman's father is a very rich man with a past where he mistreated people and took advantage of others. He is accompanied by a retired army major who limps because of a war wound, or so he says. A newly rich young woman is also on the train. Was her father defrauded by the murdered woman's father, and then committed suicide. Poirot is attracted to this woman is tells her he will help her. There is also a woman, her much younger husband, and her daughter. This woman wants to get money from the newly rich woman. Why was the woman killed? Who did it? And why was she so viciously disfigured? Was robbery the motive for the murder? Did one or more people kill the woman because of revenge? If so, why? Some viewers may consider this large array of characters and the subplots associated with them confusing; others, me included, think that the assortment of characters adds to the baffling and entertaining mystery.",1320278400,,1694,4.612582781456954
8257946,4,B00158UOA2,"""The Mystery of the Blue Train"", based on Agatha Christie's 1928 novel, is an 90-minute film that was part of Series 10 of ITV's ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"" in 2006. Though it doesn't quite have the charm and style of 1990s Poirot, this is one of the better episodes made in the 2000s. David Suchet is very much in form as the Belgian detective: warm, protective, dapper, and a little impatient with tedious people. This is a much better train mystery than 2010's distasteful adaptation of ""Murder on the Orient Express"". I'd have given it 5 stars if not for some superfluous and distracting subplots. Bizarrely, three expletives have been conspicuously deleted from the dialogue.

Katherine Grey (Georgina Rylance) has recently inherited a large sum of money and with it the attentions of many long lost relatives. Her cousin Lady Tamplin (Lindsay Duncan) has invited Katherine to visit her on the French Riviera. She is to take ""Le train bleu"" from London to Nice, as is Hercule Poirot, who befriends Katherine at their London hotel. Also on the train is Ruth Kettering (Jaime Murray), daughter of American oil tycoon Rufus Van Aldin (Elliot Gould), who intends a tryst with her lover Count de la Roche (Oliver Milburn), as she seeks a divorce from husband Derek (James D'Arcy). Lady Tamplin, her brash daughter Lenox (Alice Eve), and forth husband Corky (Tom Harper) surprise Katherine on the train. Ruth is found bludgeoned to death, her invaluable and infamous gemstone, the Heart of Fire, missing.

Katherine is a bit mousy and becomes moreso as the film progresses. She has an appealing, if clumsy, candor in the beginning, but I didn't like her by the end. All the other potential victims and suspects are interesting. Lady Tamplin and family are particularly so. They don't hide their desire for cousin Katherine's money, but they're fun and sympathetic nonetheless. Subplots involving Ruth Kettering's mother and an elegant mystery woman (Josette Simon) have been added by the screenwriter, I believe. There is some shuffling of characters from the novel, but that reasonable. The addition of characters and subplots, however, is awkward, cluttered, and distracts from the film's considerable strengths. Otherwise, one of the best Poirot episodes in recent years. Bonus features on the A&E 2006 DVD are brief text bios of Agatha Christie, David Suchet, and Hercule Poirot. No subtitles.",1319155200,,2395,5.107142857142857
8257947,5,B00158UOA2,"I originally owned The Mystery of the Blue Train as a part of a set of DVDs, which was eventually stolen as luck would have it on a train trip to Florida.  For years I could not find a copy of it as a standalone purchase.  As I was trolling around on Amazon recently, I found this copy.  It was reasonably priced, and it arrived in excellent condition and timely.  So thank you...my DVD series is once again in tact!",1284768000,3,416,4.1625
