8601264,5,B00E4Y024C,Amazing ships and amazing sailors serving on them! Thank you National Geographic for documenting them.,1461456000,,102,5.866666666666666
8601265,5,B00E4Y024C,This was an excellent program. It showed the two ships U.S.S. Freedom LCS-1 and the U.S.S. Independence LCS-2 on their trials with the testing phases they go through to be made ready for service in the United States Navy. And being at an hour and a half the price for this dvd is grear. I highly recommend this dvd for anyone interested in the future of U.S. Naval ships.,1403049600,2,371,4.391304347826087
8601266,4,B00E4Y024C,"I gave this program 4.5 stars because it really covers BOTH the USS Freedom and the USS Independence very well and pretty evenly. The footage is all color and is very recent (around 2012). It covers the sea trials of both warships from the firing of the ship's guns, launching of helicopters, different modules that can be fitted for different missions to the performance of each of the warships. This program will give the viewer a good idea of the cutting-edge technology (computer systems, equipment and weapons) of these ships. The program is 90 minutes long providing a great value for the price of $20.00. It can seem a little slow in the pace of the program and is a bit lengthy but those are really the only negatives. The footage is mostly of the sea trials with interviews from Navy brass to the Captains and the crew, with a little from the construction of both warships. I found this program to be very informative and entertaining. I would recommend this dvd to the naval enthusiast and historian, as well as anyone wanting to see where the US Navy is headed in the near future. It showcases the performance and capabilities of BOTH warships very well! I was pleased to find a dvd program that had both ships in it. This is a value for the price!",1390953600,,1259,4.5506607929515415
