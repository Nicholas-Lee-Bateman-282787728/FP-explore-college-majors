6565621,5,B00MA14W74,"Don is one of the great storytellers of music - touches on life, politics, and, of course, music.  Am so glad that this concert was restored and made available for viewing.  The video is presented in a square-box format to preserve the original filming but doesn't detract from the songs and heartfelt way that Don's many years of playing clubs and concerts has allowed these songs to endure.",1423353600,2,392,4.75

6565634,1,B00MA14W74,This had to be Don McLean at his LEAST musical.  He sounded awful and was very wooden on-stage.  Not worth watching.,1458000000,,116,4.476190476190476
6565635,2,B00MA14W74,Not my cup of tea.,1458000000,,18,2.8
6565636,4,B00MA14W74,"I remember Don McLean as more of a folk singer than anything else.  'Vincent' is the most intensely descriptive ballad ever written in my life time.

This concert shows him as both, the folk singer and the R&B/R&R influence.  I didn't recognize some of his efforts here but saw a personable side to the man I hadn't seen before.  There's a social conscience to this performance and he's not afraid to address life in America with some of its warts.  Unfortunately, as some performers become 'seasoned' they seem to become complacent with performance and stray too far from what the audience has been used to hearing from them.  This shows up mostly at the ends of some musical phrases in familiar songs that helped to identify the writer's talent and to endear them to those who listen, i.e. instead of finishing the musical phrase, the lyrics drop off into a spoken, off-key dead end.  I don't like that in any live singer/songwriter:  Deviate a little, sure, but play the damn thing the way you originally wrote it and finish each phrase with a cadence that's somewhat recognizable.  Artistic license is one thing.  But, when the musical phrase loses its muse and identity in a performance, it looks like laziness and complacence to me.

That said, I've always liked this guy.  Not as versatile or prolific as John, Gordon, James, Neil, Judy, Jonie or Emily but still a great voice with warm, expressive writing and lovely, simple chord progressions.  Also, the high end of his vocal range carries with it a very special character that really shines. His finger-style guitar work on that Martin D40 (?) is really nice.  I do wish though it had been mic'd better:  too much compression for such a beautiful, resonant instrument - it might as well have been a Takamine or Taylor of some kind.

Overall, the Manchester concert is worth a listen.  Minus a star for phrasing, sound quality and (what every performer does) fun-filler music.",1457568000,,1936,4.783132530120482

6565651,5,B00MA14W74,Prior to watching this video I had no idea who Don McLean was with the exception of Starry Starry Night and American Pie.  But after watching the Concert I am going to buy some more of his music.  Very talented singer and poet.,1444435200,,227,4.255813953488372

6565655,5,B00MA14W74,"Completely. This man can do no wrong. That being said, it's different from the documentary. It's a concert in England several years ago, that he'd put away, then decided to try to digitize because it's actually the only recording of him doing a concert. There were only 3 machines in the world capable of translating the first medium into this one. He's very serious, there's no banter, the audience sounds like a Beatles crowd. They're absolutely worshiping him. For the latter 3r or so he adds drums, guitars, piano from about 5 other guys, with no conversation about it. There's only 1 place, during American Pie, when there's a young woman crying in the 1st row, when he actually smiles, & then it's the huge beaming bright ALIVE smile that we're used to. That moment is in start contrast, & it's very dramatic. The DVD is worth buying just for that. He's very reserved & almost seems nervous or weirdly shy for the entire rest of the DVD. He does a handful of songs, mostly very political, that I wasn't familiar with. PASSIONATE songs.",1432512000,11,1041,4.663043478260869

6565659,5,B00MA14W74,Very well done.  Most of his big songs were covered and the others just sounded nice because he was singing them.  It was just like listening to him live.,1427587200,2,154,4.275862068965517

6565662,5,B00MA14W74,"An excellent video of Don at his best. There might have been better interaction if it had been filmed before an American audience, but it was a great show. I'm glad it was rediscovered for us to enjoy. A nice mix of old classic stuff and new tunes.",1425513600,2,248,4.1875

8671094,3,B00MA14W74,Nice concert but the video and sound quality is not very good.,1481155200,,62,4.25
8671095,3,B00MA14W74,"I've liked Don McLean's music especially in the 1970's and 1980's. However, most of it is because of my inclination for folk and folkrock music. My favorite Don McLean was actually his version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"", with his acoustic guitar intro. Unfortunately, little of this performance is done as ""acoustic"" or even ""acoustic sounding"". Even on ""Crying"", his acoustic guitar sounds more like electric, and the rock band backup didn't help. Almost all of the songs here sound like an electric rock band, and not that great (Yes, I did like Beatles and Stones electric stuff in the late 60's, early '70's, but they had much better arrangements).",1479168000,,651,4.981651376146789

8671098,1,B00MA14W74,I loved his music back when I was a teenager in the 70's but he just did not have the same sound he took all his songs in this concert and CHANGED them he sings the same words but he slowed then down like (American Pie0 does not sound the same. Why change something that works ? I did not like sorry Don.,1474848000,,304,3.8412698412698414
8671099,5,B00MA14W74,I enjoyed this dvd concert very much. Don McLean is a very talented singer/songwriter.,1474243200,,86,5.214285714285714
8671100,2,B00MA14W74,"Although I loved his music back when it was fresh and new, Don McLean has lost the ability to sing in the ensuing years. His compositions were beautiful, poignant, topical, and made us all yearn for those days of innocence. His voice and his delivery of those songs have just fallen off the track. we tried to appreciate the artist, and his music but it was too painful to sit through. Some artist find a way of doing live close to the studio recording and that is great. Some artists interpret their music and the live performance becomes a whole new experience and that is great. There was to much lost in the emotion, the delivery, and even the audience reaction.",1468627200,,666,4.512396694214876
