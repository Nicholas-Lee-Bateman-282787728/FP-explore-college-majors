3506219,5,B001C4Z63E,"Kabluey, written and directed by Scott Prendergast is one of our family's favorite movies. Prendergast brings his characteristic perspective to a feature film, starring in it as he does many of his shorts (The Delicious, Anna is Being Stalked, etc.). I will leave the plot summary to some of the other reviews (perhaps i should review the reviews). Both humorous and heartbreaking at times, the underlying message of this film is the strength in family, even when they may seem to be your biggest obstacles. The film quality is very professional, and Lisa Kudrow is at her usual best. The great thing about watching non-formulaic independent films as compared to big blockbusters is that you really don't predict what may happen. As an avid movie watcher, it's too easy to predict to the minute what is going to happen and when. The characters in Kabluey are real, and face things we all face, deployments, alienation from family, hideously torturous children to whom you are related and from whom you may not escape, marital affairs, everything but shrieking eels and ROUS's. Like the great character actors you will see peppered throughout this movie (Teri Garr, Conchita Ferrell) the characters within the film are funny and interesting. Prendergast can speak volumes with his facial expressions alone and you can read the very thoughts going through his characters face that you hear being spoken inside your head when you are stuck in odd and intractable situations beyond both your control and understanding. Is this your typical family movie? maybe not, but it suits ours perfectly and has held up well with repeated veiwings. and in the end, if you don't agree, its just a movie . . .",1254441600,2,1692,4.940350877192983
3506220,5,B001C4Z63E,"My friend Robert Byrd invited me over to a friend's house to watch this movie.  We had a lovely dinner and then we popped the movie in.

I found this movie to be charming, provocative and hilarious.  A truly wonderful film.

Robert, however, was having a completely different experience.  He's written his own review on here.  I should probably mention that Robert worked in high school as a mascot.  And that while handing out flyers on a deserted road in Nevada, he was abducted by aliens.  When he returned ""20 months later"" (which we all said was more like 15 minutes!) he claimed they had performed all sorts of horrible, horrible experiments on him.  And now he can ""levitate"" and he talks directly to the pope through re-broadcasts of the David Letterman show, and what have you.

That's all really beside the point, I guess.  We never should have watched this delightful movie with Robert.  It just brought up FAR too many bad memories.

Did I mention that during the entire dinner AND movie Robert was wearing a Mike Tyson mask?  Never a dull moment.

Anyway - Robert became so enraged and unruly that we had to STOP the movie.  (We met later that night after Robert had ""flown away"" (on his bicycle) and finished the movie.)

Again, the movie is delightful.  But I wouldn't recommend watching it with persons who have had contact with aliens.

I can't help but wonder about Robert now.  Where he is - what he's doing.  I know he had a cabin in the mountains from which he likes to write Amazon reviews and practice his ""jumping exercises.""

Look, I'm in love with him, the crazy fool.  I don't care what the aliens did to him.  I love him.  Two people, falling in love.  It's natural.  As natural as peas and carrots.

I'm sorry, I had to take a nap and lie down but i'm ready to finish this review now.

I loved this movie, Kabluey.  And every time I watch the full price copy I purchased on Amazon I cry and cry like a little girl.

Robert is invisible, did I mention that?

Help me find him - won't you?  Please - buy a copy of this movie and walk the streets with it - calling out his name.

It's the only hope I have left.

Thank you

Sincerely,

Eleanor Roosevelt.",1254441600,4,2180,4.400503778337532

3506222,4,B001C4Z63E,"An exceptionally heartwarming story with real-life ramifications and well-developed, well-drawn out characters. This film is as touching as it is hilarious - there's something that resonates or amuses or delights at every turn. This film is unexpectedly humorous and bittersweet in all the right parts.",1229385600,4,302,5.733333333333333
3506223,4,B001C4Z63E,"Doesn't the title of this film arouse memories of your childhood reading your favorite superhero comic book? Kabluey was one of the sounds indicating a loud, ground shaking explosion letting the reader know that the commencement of hostilities between powerful enemies had just begun.  I think the spelling was different but I believe the comparison is valid and accurate. The quirky '08 film `Kabluey' tells the tale of a family about to self-destruct. With the prolonged absence of her husband overseas fighting the war in Iraq poor Leslie (Lisa Kudrow) has fallen into deep depression mode and her two young sons aren't fairing much better. In an act of desperation she invites her inept, out of work brother-in-law Salman (Scott Prendergast) to move in and help take care of her two sons while she's at work.

Upon his arrival it immediately becomes obvious that Salman is no better off than they are and hence the situation appears to be progressing from bad to worse. With Leslie's help Salman is hired to wear an outlandish blue costume and stand on the highway passing out brochures' advertising rental space. What first appears to be yet another disaster slowly begins to turn into a stroke of good fortune and Salman finds himself a popular figure amongst the local children attracted to the cartoon-like figure. Hiding within the `blue man' he discovers a part of himself that eventually gives him the strength and courage to do what he must do with or without the costume.

`Kabluey' is one of those slow moving indie films that rely more on visuals and mood than on dialogue or storyline to sustain audience interest and that it does quite well. It also contains an off-beat soundtrack perfect for the surreal environment unfolding on-screen. Maybe not something that would stand up well to repeated viewings but certainly worth seeing at least once.",1228521600,6,1863,4.945686900958466
3506224,5,B001C4Z63E,"2007's Kabluey is a brilliant, offbeat film written, directed by and starring the quirky Scott Prendergast.

Salman(Prendergast) is a 30-something year old who's got nothing to show for himself, without enough money to buy even a bus ticket.  He's called for a favor; to help his brother's wife and kids while he is away at war.

The life at home is chaotic and Salman is not welcomed with open arms by  either of the two children or his sister-in-law Leslie(Lisa Kudrow).

When Salman lands a job as a big blue character handing out fliers for open office space for rent on the side of a not-so-busy street, Salman begins to get some attention that he deserves.

With a little help from the alien-like blue suit, Salman starts to turn his life around; performing at a child's birthday party, connecting with his nephews, and replacing a kind old man's thermos.

Includes a great offbeat indie soundtrack and fabulous surreal and hilarious visuals, with cutting witty dialogue.

Kabluey is enjoyable, entertaining and a lot of fun. (also, watch the end credits, they are adorable!)",1228003200,5,1081,4.9010989010989015
3506225,5,B001C4Z63E,"There are few movies that can spark your interest, humor and empathy and ""Kabluey"" is the best one.  With a star as unbeatable as Lisa Kudrow as a mother who's husband is shipped off again to Iraq, leaving her with two monstrous sons, she can barely hang on.  Enter her brother-in-law loser (Scott Prendergast), also the director, and the film escalates.  Salman (loser brother-in-law) shows up to help with the kids, but only proves that he makes matters terribly, terribly worse.  Mom (Lisa Kudrow) is struggling with a full time job and the loneliness of no husband.  To help, Salman (the fish salmon jokes are endless) gets a demeaning job as a corporate mascot to hand out `office rental space' on a highway to nowhere.  From here, the plot moves on to the other community parents, other nasty kids, sexual gossip, affairs and much more than you would ever anticipate.  Teri Garr makes a great cameo as a disgruntled former employee of the `mascot's' firm.  Conchata Ferrell is a hilarious character actress that brings levity to every scene as Salman's boss (this woman is brilliant). The turnabout ending is perfect as truth comes visiting and the family dynamics produce a believable and welcome happy ending.

To add:  I have never seen SO MANY deleted scenes as extras on any DVD.  And all of them are priceless.  This is the kind of film you wish you could have witnessed the filming from beginning to end.  Lots of extras on this DVD.",1222473600,8,1446,4.736
3506226,5,B001C4Z63E,"The film has a simple unpretentious local feel.

3506227,5,B001C4Z63E,"A beautiful multi-layered film. While it does have more than a few funny moments, the film is a thoughtful reflection on an array of characters that are adrift and emotionally isolated... but who still manage to keep pushing forward. There is also a real sense of quiet desperation that runs through some of the characters and makes their stories all the more endearing and bittersweet. When the main character is dehumanized into a large, faceless, blue thing(Kabluey), his lack of objections are completely believable.

With nice acting and superb writing the film achieves a nice feel. In ""True Stories"" (1986), David Byrne used the characters in a small town to offer a quirky yet optimistic view of what America was becoming. Kabluey, in its' own quirky way but with a similar feel, uses a minimal cast in a small town to convey some of the realities of what America actually became.",1221350400,6,888,4.880794701986755
3506238,5,B001C4Z63E,"Thank you, Scott Prendergast, for the best movie EVER! I watched this movie every night when I was up with my newborn daughter.  It made me happy. Great movie!",1354665600,,159,4.482758620689655
3506239,1,B001C4Z63E,"I'm all for wacky off beat black comedies which borderline dark narcissism or something that's character driven..I'm all for movies that star one of my favorite stars (Lisa Kudrow), but this ain't one of them..it's a frickin' mess from start to finish. It's pointless, a waste of some talented individuals (Kudrow, Taylor & Garr)... and by the end of the film you care less about everyone involved... I would NEVER recommend this to anyone; not even an enemy.. I can't believe this movie even exists and that someone, somewhere, in some office, thought this was worth making. The film makes no statement (which isn't a bad thing), but it's not entertaining either....and what's really scary is that so many people seemed to loved it... the xanax crowd??

  Some reviewers on here have said there's political messages in it, which is completely false. It's set during war time, and the beginning is setting up a boring cliched plot and an excuse to let us know that a war bride can't keep it together while her hubby is away at war, which explains the two monster children... and the disconnected and estranged brother-in-law whose life was going nowhere when he's asked to come and watch the two demon seeds who have no structure or boundaries...

  Kudrow's character is cold, emotionless, unappreciative and very difficult to empathize with through out, and it's got to be one of the worst roles she's ever played..

 The film attempts to go where dozens of other films have gone, until the film ends up in a dead end & then suddenly, the husband does come home, but he's just a blurred one dimensional image (even though we were forced to see him in long shots throughout the film in photos hung on the wall)... maybe this was to keep him as a generic image to symbolize the common soilder...or..whatever...... But he never once acknowledges his brother who dropped his life to come help out.... And so the brother-in-law suddenly leaves and there's absolutely no resolution, except to say that he's a doormat, and she's a lying cold b***h who now has her husband back and they're going to live happily ever after in their suburban house and 2.5 kids...and a lie that will never surface because ""I really do love your brother... I do..I really do..No, really, I do..I do....... I do"".. MESS..

  Oh, Sorry, did I fail to put a spoiler alert at the top of my review??....ooops....Trust me, I'm doing you all a favor - you're welcome. This movie was nothing short of horrible.",1339200000,,2477,4.75058275058275
3506240,4,B001C4Z63E,"`Kabluey' is not your typical kind of comedy.  It isn't laugh out loud funny and its darker side is certainly more prevalent than one may have initially thought.  It is subtle, but it makes a big impact as it lingers on the screen.  That said; there is an airy emptiness that also is prevalent and one that makes this a hard film to truly enjoy or at least fondly remember.

It feels unlike anything else I've ever seen.  It isn't perfect as a whole, but in parts it is flawless.

The story tells that of a desperate mother left to wrangle two seriously unruly children while her husband is away in Iraq.  To help, the man's loser brother comes, but he's almost more trouble than he's worth considering that he lacks any real skill.  He gets a thankless job as a roadside mascot of sorts and he begins to use this guise as a way to intake knowledge of everyone around him.  He observes and thus we observe and we start to see the reality of certain things that are not all what they seem.  The film's conclusion was pitch perfect for the direction things were headed, because it added a certain depth that could have been wasted on a perceived clich&eacute;.  Kudrow is wonderful as the exhausted mother, and Conchata Ferrell, Teri Garr and Christine Taylor all make the most of their scenes.  Scott Prendergast (who also directs) isn't particularly interesting, but his character is basically a doorway to another world, so as a prop he works well I suppose.

I'm still not sure how I really feel about this movie.  I want to say its sublime and yet part of me also wants to say it is missing something pertinent; I just can't decide what that is exactly.",1338508800,,1656,4.476666666666667
3506241,4,B001C4Z63E,"Scott Prendergast wrote, directed and stars in ""Kabluey!,"" an indie comedy that's as quirky and offbeat as its title.

""Friends""' Lisa Kudrow stars as Leslie, a small town woman whose husband has been off fighting in Iraq for a year and a half and whose two unruly sons are more than this harried, overstressed mom can reasonably cope with on her own. Enter Prendergast as Salman (like Salman Rushdie, he proudly proclaims), Leslie's ne'er-do-well but well-intentioned brother-in-law who comes to live with the family and ostensibly offer his assistance - though Salman may be in as much need of help as Leslie and the kids.

""Kabluey!"" is distinguished primarily by its droll and understated visual humor, which comes primarily through the humiliating costume Salman is forced to don for his job delivering flyers advertising a flat-lining dot.com company to utterly uninterested and even dismissive passersby. Salman has been pretty much a failure his entire life, but he soon discovers that, even though he can lose himself and even take a proactive role by hiding his identity in the suit, it is ultimately only by shedding the costume that he can hope to grow up a bit and become a responsible, fully functioning adult.

""Kabluey!,"" like most idiosyncratic independent comedies, captures the capricious flakiness of the people and environs of small-town life and the special quality of alienation that seems to reside in such places - and no one is more faceless and alienated than Salman when he's stuck in that suit. Its talented cast also includes Terri Garr (Kudrow's real-life mother and perfect voice-match), Christine Taylor, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and ""SNL"" and ""Portlandia""'s Chris Parnell.

It's a nicely atmospheric look at post-9/11 America, one that mixes humor and pathos in roughly equal measure.",1330819200,,1813,5.177474402730375

3506243,3,B001C4Z63E,"I don't watch a lot of movies, because to me a lot of movies are garbage.  A friend suggested that I pick it up so I did...  First off Lisa Kurdrow is a wonderful actor.  I have seen her in several different parts and she never seems to stop shining a true artistic light on any role she takes.  Her supporting cast is ok, save Conchata Ferrell who is straight up delightful in this film.  The children are over played and certainly get the point across of being obnoxious, perhaps too much.
  I am not going to into great depth about the movie, but it is a unique story line that is not overly political as I thought it would be, though there are a few needless opinions.  Dad/Husband goes to war and Uncle comes to help is the basic plot, but what transpires from there is interesting.
  It is by no means some same old same old movie with too much drama.  A story is told and few words are spoken, a testament to the writer/director.  I would watch this film again and would recommend it to a few of my friends, as well as anyone else who doesn't want to sit around and watch main stream garbage.",1281398400,,1099,4.205741626794258

I purchased this film on a friend's recommendation and took it to dinner at the home of a couple of other friends.  After eating a great meal we sat down to enjoy the movie.  Somehow we knew we were in trouble around the first fifteen minutes, or so.  We just didn't connect with the rather weak story, the contrived characters or the extremely flat production.  About 40-minutes in we determined there was no way things would get better, so we decided to call it quits.  But after stopping the DVD we wanted to see how the movie ended, so we popped it back in the player and went to the last few chapters.  It turns out we were pretty much on the money in predicting how it would end.  So, in addition to being hopelessly boring, it also suffered from a bad and totally predictable screenplay.  KABLUEY was an unfortunate waste of time that tried very hard to get laughs and failed miserably.  I would give in no stars if I could.",1259452800,3,1007,4.360215053763441

8286085,4,B001C4Z63E,"Released in 2017 and directed/written by Scott Prendergast, ""Kabluey"" is an offbeat dramedy starring Prendergast as the bumbling black sheep of the family who comes to town to help his sister-in-law (Lisa Kudrow) & two unholy terror nephews after his brother is deployed to Iraq. He lands a part-time job as a mascot for a struggling internet firm where he meets an uptight Broomhilda (Conchata Ferrell) and his sister-in-laws libidinous boss (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Christine Taylor, Teri Garr and Angela Sarafyan are also on hand.

The movies not great, but its original, quirky and quietly amusing. Kudrows acting is phenomenal, particularly once you know how the story pans out and view it again (note the hollow look in her eyes when she pulls in her driveway at night). While mostly a comedy, Kabluey is also sometimes poignant and includes one of the best portrayals of genuine repentance on film. In addition, the cast features a quality Smorgasbord of females.

The film runs 86 minutes and was shot in Austin, Texas.
