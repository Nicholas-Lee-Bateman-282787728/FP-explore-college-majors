7207777,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Wonderfully staged, acted, and costumed. Interesting palace intrigue and very interesting characters. A wonderful date movie.",1435622400,,125,6.875
7207778,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,Quite a lovely film on the power of natural beauty and grace. The cast is wonderful lead by the incredible Kate Winslet. My spirit felt renewed after watching it.  Great direction (and acting) by Alan Rickman. Mot to be missed!,1435363200,5,227,4.675
7207779,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Alan Rickman has outdone himself.  This movie in one word: Lush.  Kate Winslet yet again proves why she is an actress for the generations. Matthias the young Belgian lead is wonderful.  A very simple uncomplicated love story . The musical score was beautiful.  Stanley Tucci a marvel as usual.  There were so many wonderful scenes but the one that really stands out is when Winslet's character Sabine gives Rickmans's character, King Louis XIV , a lecture on the life and purpose of a rose or an analogy on the fading of beauty.  Absolutely splendid film.  I will have to own this one and the score as well.",1435363200,210,607,4.616822429906542
7207780,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"I am totally charmed by this movie. Just came from a theatre almost full on a Saturday afternoon and would like to own this one. Kate Winslet is as intense and charming as she can be, the love story is touching, the dialogue makes the period come alive. I can't understand why RT has not rated this film higher. No dinosaurs, CGI or superheroes just love and love for creativity.",1435363200,57,379,4.428571428571429
7207781,4,B00Y7R9FWQ,"""A Little Chaos"" (2014 release from the UK; 117 min.) brings the story of Sabine and Andr. As the movie opens, we are informed it is ""Paris, 1682"". King Louis XIV (played by Alan Rickfield) is awakened by children, and he decrees that gardens of all sorts need to be built at Versailles. Andr (played by Matthias Schoenaerts) is the royal landscaper in charge of the project, and he interviews a number of potential candidates to design and build an outdoor ballroom. Sabine (played by Kate Winslet) is not an obvious candidate, with her unconventional designs and ideas. ""The abundance of chaos is your idea of Eden"", comments Andr. Despite his initial misgivings, Andr hires Sabine. ""Why me?"", she asks him. ""These gardens are large enough to have voices other than mine"", responds Andr. At this point we are not eve 15 min. into the movie. Will Sabine complete the project successfully? IS there a potential romance in the air between Sabine and Andr? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love for Alan Rickfield, who not only stars, but also directed and co-wrote the movie (his second, after 1997's The Winter Guest). But as coincidence would have it, this is the second costume drama in as many weeks that I have seen, and both of them starred up-and-coming Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts (first in ""Far From the Madding Crowd"", now this). Here Schoenaerts is the leading man opposite Kate Winslet, and his role here is even more restrained than it was in ""Far From a Madding Crowd"". Rather strange to witness, in particular as compared to his breakout roles in ""Bullhead"" and ""Rust and Bone"". But it is clear that this guy is going places. Kate Winslet is now approaching 40, if you can believe it, nut easily looking 10 years younger than that. She remains a top notch actress. The pacing of the movie is at times a bit slow, but overall Rickfield does a good job. Last but not least, there is a rich musical score in the movie, composed by Peter Gregson. If I had to choose between this movie and ""Far From the Madding Crowd"", I'd probably have to go with the Carey Mulligan movie, though.

Hailing from Belgium myself, I had been looking forward to this movie, mostly to see Schoenaerts. The movie finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise (and heavily leaning towards seniors, I might add). If you are in the mood for a costume drama and you have already seen ""Far From the Madding Crowd"", I might suggest you check out ""A Little Chaos"", be it in the theater, on Amazing Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1435363200,7,2779,4.669387755102041

7207789,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Winslet will go down in history as one of the premier actors of all time. She is so believable. Her talent seems just to be a natural extension of who she is as a person. Unlike in The Mountain Between Us, which I highly recommend!, Winslet's beauty is on full display from the time we first see her. Matthias Schoenaerts is still ""up and coming"" in American movies, (I cannot find many movies of his). He is a prize and a joy to watch as an actor. See him also in Suite Francaise with Mitchelle Williams. Even war cannot catch people when they are falling in love.",1528416000,3,565,4.289719626168225

7207792,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Rickman and Winslet did Sense and Sensibility, reuniting in these roles as an ode to midlife second chances. The two cultivated a beautiful rapport. As a gardener, the metaphor is clear on many levels. A sweet farewell to Rickman who died of cancer in early 2016. I'm sure as they filmed this, cast and crew were aware of his illness.",1528156800,2,334,4.583333333333333

Furthermore, I am very critical of film writing, monologues/dialogues, and this movie has hit the mark of absolutely more than acceptable, entertaining, believable and even enthralling, I might say. So happy I watched the entire movie. They usually put me to sleep. This one did not put me to sleep, but I did have to pause a few times. The non-sleep factor and the fact that I actually went back to finish, says more than I ever could!",1528070400,,540,4.6947368421052635

7207818,2,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Is there anything more irritating than a historic piece that is a total fabrication?  I was so intrigued by the notion of a woman designing part of the Versailles gardens that I looked up the story, only to find that this film is 100% fiction.  While parts of the garden itself are real, even the main architect in the story,  Andr Le Ntre, was 70 when he started the project- he was not young or beautiful.  There was no romance.  King Louis IV never met this incredible woman and she never defended the ladies of the court by comparing them to innocent roses.  Considering that her interactions with the women of the court were the most poignant of the entire film, I am so disappointed in the storyline!  Even the garden itself has a history different than the one told in this movie.  In researching the garden's history, I don't believe it ever had a checkered dance floor.  (Which is good; I didn't like that aspect.)  For me, the best part of historic drama is learning something interesting about the past.  This film offered nothing on that score and indeed, lies about an important French landmark.  If a person didn't research the truth of the film, they might end up making a fool of themselves at a dinner party.  The film doesn't redeem itself on any other front to save itself from this delinquent 'poetic license'- the acting is good- the star studded cast ensured that.  The costumes were lovely and much of the scenery was lovely.  But the pace of the movie was slow and rather muted; the romance was the same.  In the end, there's just not much to recommend this movie.  If it were about a real event a real people, then there would be real value- but it is all a lie, so don't bother.",1522108800,,1704,4.4627831715210355
7207819,3,B00Y7R9FWQ,"This wasn't a bad movie, it just lacks any real drama or tension.  Yes, there is a little here and there, but overall your enjoyment of this movie will probably depend on your interest in this time period -- which I think is France in the late 1600s or early 1700s.  I can't say how authentic it is to the era, but it looked very good.  The movie actually looks better than the story being played out, which again, wasn't bad, but would have had me fidgeting in the movie theater.  I watched this at home and was able to take breaks.  That helped.  A solid 3 stars, maybe 3.25.",1521158400,,577,4.2

It wasn't for lack of trying, but they just didn't click together. At best it's a diverting couple of hours but far from the movie it could have been.",1516752000,,288,4.0701754385964914

7207835,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Everything a gorgeous period piece should be. Exquisite in every direction - the look, the sound, the acting, the direction, the script... heaven.  It's a subtle story - this is the second time I've seen it, and I appreciated it even moreso. Alan Rickman's directing is just so perfect - as is, of course, his acting.  Kate Winslet never fails to compel or amaze me, and Matthias Schoen... (sorry, not looking at the spelling at the moment) --well, he's just delicious in every respect.  They are a marvelous pair to watch.  Helen McCrory and Stanley Tucci and all the supporting actors are fabulous.  Not a foot wrong in this film.

7207846,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,I loved the actors and I loved this movie! I'm not sure what the negative reviews are about--- this is a lovely simple tale of 2 wonderful people who fall in love while doing what they love. It is a great snapshot on a period in time where are relationships and social structures accepted different forms of relationships and circumstances as a means to their own happy ending. It is not a very complex story but one that is meant more for the depth heart and Artistry that is the experience of those in the story and those witnessing it. The acting was amazing and the plot definitely kept me engaged with little comedy and even little Sinister twists. The love story is very sweet but not the center of this film-- if you like period Pieces you should definitely watch this movie.,1514246400,,782,4.475524475524476

I watched it because I love all performances of Alan Rickman, Stanley Tucci and Kate Winslet. Neither have disappointed me yet. Instead I was delightfully surprised with everything about the film. It might be because of my love for gardening, but I never tire of watching this film. I won't give any spoilers. The performances are exceptional! To me the real star are the gardens. My heart was lost in its scenery. The characters were all so interesting and watchable. I so recommend this movie. To truly enjoy it, it is best not to have any interruptions.

7208105,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"First, I beg you not to get your knickers all twisty about the plausibility of the story. Is it likely that an odd, headstrong widow of obscure birth and no name would bend gender roles in 17th century France to become a royal garden architect to Louis XIV? No. But who cares? Do I believe a black obelisk floating in space is actually the boot disc for a whole new universe? No.

You see? Fiction = Making Stuff Up.

Now. With knickers returned to their upright and locked position, you'll be able to appreciate how this movie walks quietly through our best and worst selves. It looks under trees and in flower pots for the Hide-A-Key to our behaviors: Power, fame, wealth, love, grief, and our deep-set need to be truly seen by another person, all color how we are the world.

But if that's all waxing too philosophic, watch it for the cinematography. The DP gave us a big juicy peach, and it's delicious. From the squalor to bombastic indulgence of this period, it's all here and beautifully rendered. I also loved the script. It's lean. REALLY lean. Lesser actors go barking mad in this style ('how can I act with no words?'). But in the hands of this cast, we're given impossibly close, nuanced performances that keep us leaning in.

While I've got a white-hot crush on Matthias Schoenaert, I can't hate Kate for taking my man. These two know about creating tension. When it finally breaks, ooh they set the prairie on fire, people. The rest were equally stunning: Stanley Tucci gave us a delightful bonbon without being cartoonish, and Helen McCrory is at her devious best as Madame Le Notre.

However, they're all eclipsed by the late Alan Rickman. As the director: I count him responsible for getting these performances out of the cast, even if it was just letting them do their job. On screen: Many actors have taken their turn at playing the mercurial and extravagant Sun King, but Rickman's version is magnificent. We get all of the pomp and splendor we'd expect (and no one does pomp like Rickman), but we also see delicacy, world-weariness and a rich inner life which is entirely unexpected. Alan left us with the perfect example of 'there are no small parts, only small actors.' His scant 15-20 minutes of screen time will stand among my favorites across his amazing career. What a lovely parting gift.

We'll miss you.",1473120000,,2333,4.664233576642336

7208128,1,B00Y7R9FWQ,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0

We're told it's a sin to speak ill of the dead. Unfortunately, when reviewing Alan Rickman's 17th-century costume drama, A Little Chaos, committing such a sin might be necessary in order to convey the sheer awfulness of the late thespian's and concomitant director's project. Please don't construe that my intent is to disparage Mr. Rickman in generalquite the contrary, he was one of the finest actors of our time, who handled a vast range of roles most often with the highest aplomb.

Here, unfortunately, he not only made the mistake of acting in this turgid drama but contributed as one of the co-writers to the screenplay. The story was conceived by one Allison Deegan who somehow got the idea that there was much drama in the creation of the grand gardens at Versailles during the reign of King Louis IV in France. The focus is on landscaper Monsieur Andr&eacute; Le Ntre who designed the gardens and enjoyed the patronage of King Louis throughout his life. Unfortunately, Le Ntre was pushing 70 when the film's narrative begins in 1682. Instead, Deegan transformed Le Ntre into a stud half the real character's age and the handsome Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts was conscripted to play opposite Kate Winslet as Sabine de Barra, an independent landscaper who is hired specifically to build a fountain surrounding a small outdoor ballroom out in the middle of nowhere.

Sabine is a completely fictional character and the idea of woman working as an independent landscaper at that time is laughable. But Rickman was delighted with the idea. As quoted by Susan King in the L.A. Times, ""There would be no woman with a profession at that time,"" Rickman noted, adding that he loved the idea of ""putting a completely fictitious character in the middle of a known bit of history.""

As we slog through the proceedings (waiting for the forgone conclusion of the Versailles landscaping triumph), we must endure Winslet in the wish fulfillment plot of a feminist pioneer that never existed. Dull second act machinations include Sabine being rebuffed by laborers who don't want to work with a woman, one of Le Ntre's former job applicants offering to help, and Sabine's clever creation of a pump to divert water from a river to the fountain and back.

Romance between Le Ntre and Sabine is postponed after Le Ntre's displeasure over Sabine's decision to place plants in the garden outside of his ordered design. The spat between the two landscapers reflects the historical conflict between order and chaos, prevalent in landscape architectural circles at the time.

The lugubrious plot continues to pitch forward and we are introduced to King Louis IV and his court. The King's brother, Duc Philippe d'Orleans, played by Stanley Tucci, is introduced as an effeminate bon vivant-bisexual, but also married to the German Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine. Tucci's character provides some atmosphere but does little to advance the plot.

Rickman's King Louis IV turns out to be a rather low-key, unexciting good guy. When Sabine mistakes him for a common gardener, the King plays along and isn't upset with her for not recognizing him. He takes such a liking towards her, that she's invited to the court at Fontainebleau.

Alex von Tunzelmann, writing in the The Guardian, notes another historical faux pas: ""There is a painfully overwritten scene about aging women being like roses who lose their bloom, delivered for the benefit of Louis's mistress Madame de Montespan (Jennifer Ehle), who is being passed over for the implicitly younger and fresher Madame de Maintenon. This is not only bad, but wrong: in real life, La Maintenon was five years older than La Montespan.""

Nonetheless it's Montespan who introduces Sabine to the King and gives him a four-seasons flower, inspiring a conversation on the rose and its life cycle, a metaphor as Wikipedia tell us, ""intended to warm him toward his mistress.""

If there's an antagonist here, it's Le Ntre's wife, Franoise, who believes in sex outside marriage but only if she's on the receiving end. She has her Cruella de Vil moment when she visits Sabine and insists that Le Ntre's interest in her is only a whim. What's more, two goons she's hired open flood gates, destroying all of Sabine's hard work. Le Ntre is able to get out of the relationship with the evil Franoise, after finding a glove belonging to her at the flood site, implicating her in the dark deed. This is the dark moment at the end of the second act and we've waited an inordinate time to get to it.

The road back of course has to be the consummation of the love between Le Ntre and Sabine. This in turn allows her to confront the repressed memories of the long-ago death of her husband and young daughter, killed in a carriage accident. Sabine's project is finally completed and there's a big celebration. Game, set, match!

There isn't one iota of humor in A Little Chaos and the actors go about their business with grim faces. Schoenaerts has little to do as the handsome landscaper and Winslet is unconvincing as a feminist heroine who we know never existed. Rickman fares little better as a darker side is never really suggested.

Score this as a vanity project and an unfortunate swan song to a great actor's career. A Little Chaos does have good costumes so see it for that if you must see it at all.",1470009600,,5394,4.855277475516866

The script is an eloquent masterpiece and the magnificent cast brings it to vital, convincing life.  At the start, we are reminded that, as with much historical fiction, this is, indeed, fiction.  I suspect that it is too gentle, too literate, too unabashedly romantic to suit many viewers, but, for me, these characteristics make it a profoundly rewarding, refreshing change of pace.

7208290,3,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Id originally meant to see A Little Chaos in the theater, but the night Iwent, the projector for that film was malfunctioning and then it was gone from the theaters. But I recently picked it up on DVD (in a fit of Alan Rickman mourning -- he plays King Louis XIV).

A Little Chaos tells a highly fictionalized story of the design and construction of the gardens at Versailles under King Louis XIV, centering on a woman chosen to design and oversee one particular element of the gardens. The storyline depicts the protagonist, Sabine, as being chosen for the work by the royal gardener Andre LeNotre (who is a solidly historic figure) both despite and because of her imaginative and informal designs. In addition to the challenges of the work, of satisfying her royal patron, of dealing with jealous and sexist colleagues, and of a slow-growing romance between her and LeNotre, there are constant hints of some sort of tragic past involving her late husband and young daughter.

The story is very atmospheric, but never quite came together for me. It seemed filled with predictable tropes: the encounter with the king whom she doesnt recognize and thus interacts with as an equal, much to his amusement; the royal gardeners jealous-while-unfaithful wife who deliberately sabotages the landscaping project; the long workaholic hours as expiation for some past failure that is revealed to us at the emotional climax. But all in all it felt like an excuse for lovely scenery and fancy dress without any clear message or meaning. Given the casting (Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, Stanley Tucci, a lovely cameo by Jennifer Ehle as Madame de Montespan) one feels it could have been something more.

I was disappointed in the costuming. There was an adequate nod to the general silhouette and style, but the fabric choices all felt off, the details were completely off the mark, and Sabines look is relentlessly romantic disarray.

But among all of this weak tea, there was one scene that made me sit up and give a deep sigh of appreciation. In the midst of various crises over whether Sabine will be allowed to finish her project or not, she is summoned to the court at Fontainebleu. Before being taken into the kings presence, she is swept away by the kings mistress (the Marquise de Montespan) to a private salon with various ladies of the court. Sabine is portrayed as solidly hard-working middle class and deeply uncomfortable with this setting. At first, the ladies start in with light banter about beauty and appearances, discussing how her work hasn't coarsened her skin, and commenting on the relative beauty of their breasts (including a bit of show and tell). Then as they begin quizzing her on her personal history and ask about children, Sabine gets a stricken look (I think this is the first point when were told that her daughter is dead) and the ladies all begin sharing information about the children theyve lost, and to what, and how they aren't allowed to talk about them at court because the king doesnt want to hear about death. And suddenly all differences of rank and station evaporate and its a room full of mothers, equal in their sorrow. Of all the things the movie tried to do, that was the one that worked for me. It was a portrayal of a world of women finding common ground in the face of lives that revolve around, and are always in relation to, the powerful men in their lives.",1461283200,19,3397,4.762308998302207

I enjoyed the scenery, the costuming, the slice of life dailies in the French Court, and especially the mature, quiet attraction between Schoenaerts and Winslet. And who doesn't relish any performance by the sadly late, great Alan Rickman. He's been a favorite actor of mine since I first saw him as the thief posing as revolutionary in Die Hard. He stole the show, then again as the bad sheriff Nottingham in Costner's Robin Hood. Something about his voice made you listen.

7208339,3,B00Y7R9FWQ,"A Little Chaos is an English-speaking costume drama set in the seventeenth century France. The film follows the story of Sabine De Barra (Kate Winslet), a talented landscape artist with unconventional ideas, who is hired by Andr Le Ntre (Matthias Schoenaerts), principal gardener of King Louis XIV of France (Alan Rickman, who also directs). While creating the park of the Palace of Versailles together, the two artists get to know each other professionally and romantically.

To be frank, I am not really sure of the point the film is trying to make, because Andr is a real-life artist while Sabine is a fictional character. Maybe Sabine is intended to be a portal through which we see the world of the French court and how people act and things are done there.

The film works to some extent, thanks to the capable cast including Stanley Tucci as eccentric Philippe, Duc d'Orleans but the film often loses its way with Kate Winslets protagonist who is saddled with so many tasks at once  aspiring artist in a male-dominating community, romantic heroine, mother with sad memories. And those memories are told in abrupt flashback scenes in a very awkward way.

A Little Chaos marks Alan Rickmans second film as director (the first is The Winter Guest made in 1997). A Little Chaos is beautifully shot and well-acted, but needs a more steady pace of storytelling that would allow us to emotionally enter the world it depicts.",1457827200,,1424,4.871900826446281

Each time I watch the film, I see a little more symbolism, a little more connectivity of all things, and more nuances of genuine love. What is real love but to be seen, respected and admired for just who you are. An established and nationally recognized landscape architect and a king see a WOMAN (in the period in which the film is set) for her talent, her passion for finding her own Eden in landscape design, and her inherent kindness.

7208400,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"I watched this film the day that the news broke of Alan Rickman's passing and it only accentuated the great loss of a brilliant man.
Kate Winslet and Matthias Schoenaerts are beautifully paired as the team to construct one of the main lavish gardens for King Louis XIV (played wonderfully by Alan Rickman) at Versailles in 17th Century France. As a period piece, this does not disappoint. The scenery is exquisite, the humor is there, as well as the drama but Kate's character is a complete fantasy - a female who couldn't possibly have existed in that time period. But movies are magic and watching it works so well. Most of all, to see Kate and Alan together after Sense and Sensibility is a wonderful treat to behold.

However, the performances of Kate Winslet, Stanley Tucci, and the magnificent Alan Rickman, and the rest of the ensemble cast is a real treat! I don't mind that it is slow and elegant. There is drama mixed with comedy. I recommend if you have a bit of an imagination (not stuck in historical facts) and like a wonderful ""feel good"" period piece movie.",1454716800,,485,4.46067415730337

7208420,4,B00Y7R9FWQ,"If not for anything else than Alan Rickman's sake, I tried to love this enchanting and lavish movie enough to give it a 5 star rating, but just couldn't bring myself to do it.  There was so little ""chemistry"" between Kate Winslet and Matthias Schoenaerts that I almost wanted to light a fire under them.  His performance was tepid and reserved, while hers, although stronger, lacked the usual oomph one associates with Winslet.  More, some of the actors mumbled their lines or almost swallowed their words -- so much so that I had to replay the movie several times to understand all the nuances of what was being said.  Also, the movie was, in a few parts, poorly edited, leaving me wanting one scene to continue as it quickly shifted to the next.

Still, it is a glorious film and I recommend it to you.  It is, in part, historically accurate and the costumes were breathtaking.  The story itself is
delightful and a number of the sub-plots were superb, such as the plant nursery scene between Rickman and Winslet and Winslet's encounter with
the court ladies.  Le Notre's (Schoenaerts) wife is suitably vicious, Rickman shines as Louis XIV, the personal gardens of Winslet's character are magical and there are clever little bits throughout the movie, such in the end when the actor Stanley Tucci subtlely takes his male companion's hand as he sits next to his unloved princess wife.  You'll thoroughly enjoy this film -- just be patient with the dialogue, ignore the parts when wigs are removed and the actors sport modern Western haircuts and forgive Matthias Schoenaerts for his somewhat flaccid acting.  He is superb in other
movies.",1454630400,2,1639,4.821428571428571

7208423,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"This movie had a simple, timeless and even feel.  If I could sum up it's general aim, it would be to remind people of hope and humanity that often gets buried under the anxieties and setbacks in life.  At a time generally associated with chaos & brutality, social climbing and backstabbing, sexual promiscuity and excesses of every kind, these portrayals and personal stories will remind you that people are people,and every affair is not a selfish matter of lust or social prominence, even in the 18th century, even in the court of Louis XIV.  These threads of human joy and pain and sacrifice and holding on to dreams run throughout the movie, reinforced by the outdoor sets and relatively small number & interconnected relationships of the characters.  In this sense, the movie doesn't perhaps represent the breadth and political nastiness and maneuvering that were present in the court of Louis XIV, but it does gently imagine the human side of court life and personal choices of people who in their deepest natures are still very much like you or I.  The audience is shown hints of the politics and pretensions more commonly portrayed for Louis XIV and France where mistresses & liaisons are commonplace, but you see a much deeper and personal ""in"" side that acknowledges the negatives without emphasizing them so much that the characters seem inaccessible or incomprehensible.  In fact, what is especially humanizing about this movie is that there are several examples of liasons, some more damaging and others more freeing, but there is always some recognition of who loses out as well as some sympathetic understanding of why affairs exist and are even looked past because of the demands of political marriages, sexual orientation, and business/social expectations and matches.

And all of these very human and deeply emotional issues of life and success and loss and social negotiation are done by an extremely talented cast with excellent cinematography & scripting.  It is a great balance of romance and drama.  It's now in my permanent collection and I bought a copy of the fantastic score that Alan Rickman commissioned from Peter Gregson.",1454457600,,2152,5.03943661971831

7208474,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"I am not sure what I like most about this film. Kate Winslet is a breathtaking, the directing is exquisite, it's beautiful to look at and there are moments when the writing is unforgettable.
It is not a movie for everyone. If you're looking for broad strokes, Hollywood stars, a rollicking roller coaster of a plot and a big boat that breaks in half, you won't enjoy it. If you've seen enough of life to understand what is going on in this film, you will be captivated. You need to listen very carefully to the dialogue because some of the lines are soft and subtle and contain a world of meaning. There is one line that follows a scene in a roomful of women talking, a scene that did not at all go where I thought it was going to go, and then - Her kindness! Unbribed! Some of the scenes and some of the lines caught me completely by surprise.
At first I thought the acting was superb, then I realized that it was also the directing. The director was able to get rich and unexpected choices from the actors. The directing played with the issue of power and how it manifests in people, what it does to them and what it does to the people around them. I've known powerful people and watched them in action enough to know what was going on in this film. Stanley Tucci is always fun to watch, but he plays that same powerful entitlement, a little dangerous, with humor and charm.
I had the pleasure of seeing Alan Rickman in the original production of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, it was the first thing I ever saw him do, and I was blown away. As good as he was in that role, he was that good as a director. Of course, his Louis XIV is really amazing and not what I expected. The scripted character goes for the sword of Damocles, uneasy lies the head, etc., but Alan Rickman got a dialogue going, within that character, a discussion between a real human being and a dangerously powerful man. It was interesting to watch.
Like I said, not for everyone, but for some people it will be a rare treat.",1453507200,4,1992,4.314666666666667

7208477,2,B00Y7R9FWQ,This movie has such a promising beginning and then sort of falls apart. I feel like the problem is in the editing. Two very significant scenes between Andre and Sabine (the love scene and the confrontation after) lack depth and context because of the choppy way they are edited. I felt like the actors were all in and delivering but their performances and the storytelling were diminished by a sense of incompleteness in the narrative.

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful visually, but also the dialogue - the scenes between Kate Winslet and Alan Rickman alone, Stanley Tucci (enough said), and a couple of the scenes with all the women in the King's Court - brief, but perfectly acted, emotional reminders that even in that sumptuous time and place, tragedy was constant. I don't know the male lead, but he also gave a nuanced, emotive, non-sappy performance.

I find it hard to find movies that are smart enough, well acted, and beautiful enough to keep me interested, without being so intense I need to manage my emotions later. This movie struck a lovely balance. I'll stop now at the risk of gushing or spoiling, but trust me, you will not regret buying/watching this film.",1452211200,,883,4.733766233766234
7208515,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"One of the best movies I have ever watched. The cinematography and music blend into an emotional tour de force. Kate Winslet's performance is remarkable. She is not a strong willed woman who gets entangled in a love affair. The intent of the film is clearly a story of a love developed between a man and a woman without all the feckless mooning about that we now think of as love. No coquettish smiles or manly bravado, Winslet plays a woman with all the potency and self assurance that her character exudes. Intensely attractive with a strong full body that takes on life, designing a garden graced with the chaos of nature in the enclosure of human form and formality. The warmth and sensuality created in this film by Alan Rickman makes it a must see!",1452211200,,754,4.551470588235294

This movie is about characters and the roles they play inside the exclusive clutch of 16th-17th c. French royal courtiers - what a debauched group.  It's also about breaking the rules, choosing to be independent of the norm, nurturing the natural in the midst of decadent opulence, and much more.  The dialog is so good, so smooth, it pulls you in.  The acting is outstanding, of course, the directing & editing gives the film a seamless momentum, without distraction, and the cinematography is outstanding - a lot of beauty in this film's composition.  This is a simple story with complex characters, most of whom you can't help but like.  Well worth the watch.",1451952000,,749,4.8125
7208518,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,The movie is such a splendid surprise. I chose to watch this movie because of the setting it took place in and of all these actors. Alan Rickman is an execellent director and I see his efforts have come out with great expectations! Kate Winslet has a natural affinity for period pieces and does an excellent job playing the part. I did not know that Stanley Tucci was in it until the beginning credits and he was a great minor character. Couldn't have asked for better period drama to start out. And the music! I just loved it and I wish they played it a little more. The end scene almost made me cry. It was so touching. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!,1451433600,,668,4.309523809523809
7208519,3,B00Y7R9FWQ,"I really, really wanted to like this movie more.  I am a big fan of Kate Winslet.  I like period pieces.  All the elements were in place for a great movie.  But it falls short in one key area (I'll mention below), and that shortcoming was insurmountable.

The movie tells the fictional story of the creation of one portion of the garden at Versailles.  We meet Kate Winslet, a single lady with a tragic past, who is a bit of a visionary when it comes to landscape architecture.  She applies for the job of designing and building what is essentially an outdoor ballroom for the King's new palace and grounds.  She is hired, against the expectations of others in the court, by head landscaper Mattias Schoenaerts.  She is a commoner, and is thus a bit out of her element with court intrigue (which is admittedly very minor in this film), but still manages to catch the favorable eye of the King's cousin (a delightfully over-the-top Stanley Tucci), the King's mistress and of course, the King himself (Alan Rickman, who also directs the film).

Also, not surprisingly, romance blossoms between our two main characters (not a spoiler if you're looking at the cover of the movie!)...but for me, the romance is not even the most interesting reason to see this film.  It's all the ""other stuff"" that's more unusual.  Winslet and Schoenaerts have decent chemistry, but they don't exactly melt the screen either.  Winslet, of course, is never less than interesting as an actress, but with only a few exceptions, she is not really asked to do anything new in this film.  My favorite scenes were between Winslet and Rickman, particularly an extended scene wherein she first meets the King, but doesn't know it is him.  The scene was funny, wistful and a nice way to explore the two characters.

The scenery is lovely.  The film, understandably, spends lots of time outdoors, and a viewer with a nice television and the blu-ray is rewarded witih some lovely things to look at.  Costumes are also quite fun (Tucci gets the best ones).  The film neatly captures both cultures.  But there's nothing new or revelatory either.

This is an interesting story with people that are mostly nice to meet.  The ""villains"" are fairly minimal.  All in all, this one should have been a real treat.  The problem is this...it moves like molasses.  I am okay with movies taking their time and not feeling like they have to rush hither and yon.  But everything is made to feel tiny and more insignificant than it should.  There are no strong moments of heat or surprise or a sense that things have spun out of control or that a conflict might bring about terrible consequences.  Yes, there are sudden and unfortunate events (a scene involving flooding, for example), but they don't generate real tension.  When much of the movie feels inevitable (will she get the job?, will she find romance?), you want the director to keep things moving.  A few lingering shots is one thing...but scene after scene of staring and silences just begins to wear away at your ability to get strongly emotionally involved.  Rickman clearly loves this story, but this love causes him to linger in areas where lingering is not called for.  He can't assume we'll all love the story as he does...he needs to, as a filmmaker, lead us to that love.  But by glacial pacing, he makes it tough.

Ten to fifteen minutes of cuts (not by trimming story, but by trimming unhelpful silences) could readily have made this film go from 3.5 stars to 4 or even 4.5.  There is much to admire.  Little to love.

(Also, I've now seen Schoenaerts in FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, A LITTLE CHAOS and THE DANISH GIRL in just the last couple of months.  I've come to fear he may only have one type of performance in him...a brooding romantic.  Let's get this guy into a ""modern"" film with something meaty to try [saw him in a bit role in a couple of films...I mean, something ""big""].  I haven't seen BULLHEAD yet, but I hear he's a powerhouse in that...let's see some more of that!)",1451433600,4,4005,4.64957264957265

7208559,3,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Solid performances. Alan Rickman does a good job directing. Nice to see a story featuring a woman working in 17th century France. As a woman, I really appreciate seeing films featuring a woman's work life and I like that Mr. Rickman chose to bring a story featuring a lady's work life to the screen. Film tried to interweave a romance and court life with the same character, which I don't think was successful though I didn't think it sucked, just not emotionally engaging. The Kate Winslet character was accomplished and I accepted that she was gifted because the film presented enough of her work to demonstrate that, but I would've liked to have seen how she acquired her skill set in a time when women weren't routinely educated in the field of landscape architecture. After the first act I skipped around abit trying to get traction in the story, to no avail. I didn't like that the Kate Winslet character often stared into space. I got that she'd lost a child long before the story communicated it, but I didn't care for the way the story showed that. Having her once stare into space was enough for me to understand that she'd experienced a significant loss, especially when combined with children's sounds and children's images. Overall, the film didn't work for me though I did enjoy seeing the character's work life. 2 and 1/2 stars rounded up to 3, as there's no 1/2 star choice on Amazon.",1449014400,4,1400,4.672064777327935
7208570,3,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Alan Rickman (The Winter Guest) returns to the directors chair after a long layoff.  He also plays King Louis XIV in this fictional telling of the development of the Versailles palace and its grounds.  The French king wants a beautiful country home and charges his landscape architect, Andre Le Notre (Matthias Schoenaerts, Far From The Madding Crowd) with the design.  The King insists on an outdoor ballroom, unheard of at the time.

Le Notre interviews a handful of potential assistants including one woman, a widow, Sabine De Barra (Kate Winslet, Steve Jobs).  Put off by her answer to a question of a structured, formal design which is the norm for the time, he dismisses her.  Later with some prompting from his secretary, he offers her the job in spite of her search for an abundance of chaos in her designs.  While Le Notre is married (Helen McCrory from TVs Penny Dreadful), the marriage is a sham.  Sabine is placed in charge of creating the ballroom and shes not afraid of getting her hands dirty.  Assisted by one of her competitors at the interview, Thierry Duras (Steven Waddington), progress is made until Madame Le Notre tries to sabotage the project.

I suspect most viewers will agonize about the pacing as the film lumbers along.  But take time to enjoy the scenery and the acting skills of Ms. Winslet.  Haunted by past events advanced ever so slightly until the big reveal, Sabine focuses on her job and eventually her boss.  In a scene of one highly unlikely event, Sabine and the King meet in a secluded garden for a fun exchange.  Stanley Tucci (Spotlight) is along for the ride for some needed humor playing the bi-sexual Philippe, Duc dOrleans.  Far from perfect, the film is enjoyable for those who like a modest pace and glorious scenery.

The Blu ray disc has 1080p video resolution and a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  While the look of the film isn't quite up to demo quality, it is certainly exemplary of what the medium can project.  Most scenes include an intricate look of the excellent costume designs complete with fine detail of the clothing and work tools.  If I have a complaint it is only that there is some inconsistency in the look from scene to scene.  Suffice it to say it is hardly that noticeable but nits can be picked.  Audio comes with a fine DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  Unfortunately the musical score is barely noticeable in the film, failing to add any real character to the events that a more robust offering might provide.  This is obviously the filmmakers choice so don't hold it against the Blu ray or DTS.  They just reproduce what is given.  Again don't get me wrong, the audio is fine.  The outdoors scenes are well represented throughout in the surrounds.  The dialog-heavy film is clearly reproduced.  Subtitles come in French, Spanish and English SDH.  Nada on the extras.  In fact my copy didn't even have any trailers before or after.",1448928000,2,2894,4.718562874251497
7208571,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"This movie took my breath away. If you love beautiful people, beautiful gardens, amazing interiors, incredible costuming and love great acting, you'll love this sweet romance. It is historically correct in many ways, but not all. The main character, Sabine de Barra, did not exist. The real  Andr Le Ntre was quiet a bit older. But every other character mentioned or seen did.
It is about passion: a passion for one's work; for life; for beauty; and for true love. Alan Rickman co-wrote the screen play and gives a tour de force performance as King Louis XIV. His determination in seeing this on film and for the subtle subtext as the director is unmatched. Stanley Tucci, as the king's brother steals every moment of his limited screen time. There is  real depth of character rarely seen with such a limited role. And the two principal characters,  played by Kate Winslet and Matthias Schoenaerts, are stellar. Kate Winslet is perfection. And Matthias,  whom I had never heard of before, lights up the screen. He is definitely one to watch, his star is on the rise. He plays Andr Le Ntre, the king's master gardener, with dignity, subtlety and an underlying passion that is only hinted at.  It is the fictitious story of Louis XIVth's desire for a garden beyond perfection at Versailles. Kate Winslet (Mde.de Barra) a lady with a tragic past, is a landscape architect who is chosen to help Matthias Schoenaert's (Andr Le Ntra) design a singularly beautiful outdoor ballroom. The costuming is glorious. The movie was entirely shot in Britain. (Sorry Francophiles!) The gardens, are chiefly those of  Hampton Court, whose gardens there were actually laid out by pupils of Le Ntre, and Blenheim Palace. Interiors were from both palaces and other ancestral homes. By turns it is joyful, sad, funny, tragic and thought provoking. It is a beautiful story, lovingly shot, deftly directed and superbly acted.",1448668800,,1901,4.943573667711599

Alan Rickman went for an understated and enigmatic performance as Louis XIV, but it came across more as vague and dottering. Kate Winslet did much with her character, but her part was not especially well written -- the woobie, the scrappy and the Mary Sue triple-threat. The acting feeling off might be because the whole movie feels over-edited -- there just doesn't seem to be buildup to each event that moves the plot. Foreshadowing happens perhaps a scene before, which gives it a lampshad-ed quality. The costuming was a bit ho-hum too. The setting, however, is lovely and a joy to see.

this movie was a total disappointment. the landscapes were mediocre and uninspired, completely lacking the opulence and grandeur of french royal grounds. as for her design - you have GOT to be kidding me. is that just astro-turf and mud? and the 'grounds' of her own home which le notre ""marvels at"" were basically a patio with some potted plants (did i see some orchids from Trader Joe's in there?).

c'mon.

in addition to the landscape problems, the production itself lacked a level of polish typically found in BBC and Merchant Ivory productions. there weren't ever enough extras to really establish the grandeur of the Sun King's court - in his 'ball' at the end, there are like 30 people doing a poorly choreographed dance - looks more like a barn dance. the plot overall was thin, ridiculous, everyone at the French court speaks with inexplicable British accents, and her rose speech was cringe-worthy.

7208670,4,B00Y7R9FWQ,"If you are looking for a high level of historical period accuracy this film is not for you - Director Alan Rickman himself says on the extras that if you know a lot about this period of history you will know that some of the film is true and some of it is nonsense. But if you are looking for an entertaining romance with some excellent acting you cannot miss it, especially if you are a fan of Rickman or of Kate Winslet.

The review is based on watching the film on DVD with my wife: I bought it because I could not resist seeing what Rickman, who in addition to directing plays the part of the Sun King Louis XIV of France, would do with that part. (The answer was, a great deal.)

The film is a love story based around the construction of the Gardens at Louis XIV's palace at Versailles, and particularly about the creation of an outdoor ballroom which does actually exist and was built for real by Andr le Ntre, the hero of the film - although in real history he was pushing seventy years of age when that feature was built, about twice the age of Matthias Schoenaerts.

This is the exact opposite of the casting inconsistency made in another 17th century period epic film which came out this year, the Dutch film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Admiral-Command-and-Conquer-DVD/dp/B00WUDIVVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Admiral: Command and Conquer [DVD</a>]"" about the life of Admiral Michel De Ruyter in which King Charles II was played by Charles Dance who is twice the age King Charles was in the timeframe of the film. Perhaps Rickman and the creators of ""Admiral: Command and Conquer"" should have swapped Schoenaerts and Dance so they could each have an actor within three decades of the same age as the real historical character they were playing!

The heroine of the story is Kate Winslet who plays a fictional character called Sabine de Barra, a lady landscape gardener who is hired by Andre le Notre to build a particular part of the gardens, the outdoor ballroom also called the Rocaille Grove, because of the millstones and the sea shells brought back from the coasts of Africa and Madagascar over which the water pours down in a cascade.

This gives rise to a conflict between the visions of the two characters, Andre's passion for order and Sabine's love of landscape, a tension which was very much at the heart of real-life landscape gardening at the time. Their romance is played out against the background of the glittering, beautiful and poisonous intrigue of the Sun King's court, many - but not all - of the details of which are well captured.

Visually this is a sumptuously beautiful film with the intricate glitter of a spectacular age being very well presented.

Not a film for historical purists or indeed purists of any kind, but if you would enjoy watching some very talented actors give some of the best performances of their careers in an amusing, entertaining and sophisticated romantic romp, you will enjoy this DVD.",1445299200,,2990,4.828125

They should have called me up before releasing this movie (I don't understand why they didn't) and I would have graciously advised them what it needed:  Alan Rickman as the star, playing Louis XIV fulltime with Kate Winslet as one of the mistresses.  Apparently the scriptwriter bent over backwards trying to develop an interesting story and it simply does not work because in this case history is much more interesting than any fictional lady landscape artist.  We simply don't care enough about her and her silly back story.  We yearn to see more of the King and his girlfriends and his palaces.  And, I hate to say this too, but what has happened to Kate Winslet?  She is still beautiful but the energy and fire she showed in Sense and Sensibility and in Heavenly Creatures has almost disappeared.

Romance between the two characters is never truly developed ergo no spark in the tentative love scenes that are contrived here.  The best thing you can say for the film is it is a handsome looking period piece but that only goes so far. Narratively speaking the film could have used a little chaos to attain viewer interest.

Most of the production was very well done. The costumes and sets were lovely. The acting was good. The side bars were interesting (life at court, interaction between aristocrats and commoners, interaction between women, the period itself, etc), but the main attraction was a love story that didn't really feel all that lovely.

7208800,3,B00Y7R9FWQ,"First, the good: I adore Alan Rickman, Kate Winslet, and Stanley Tucci - all very talented artists (and Rickman directs this, as well).  I'm less familiar with Matthias Schoenaerts, but I was impressed with him in 'Suite Francaise' and have no reason to doubt his acting ability.  They each do a fine job in this film.  The costumes and sets are lovely, and the cinematography is often beautiful and unusual.  The story, itself, is somewhat interesting - though partially fictionalized (as Winslet's character did not exist in real life) - and seems to try for a quiet, rather nuanced approach.

While it succeeds in some aspects, the movie fell flat for me, and I'm not entirely sure why.  It's normally the kind of movie I am drawn towards - a costume drama with good repartee, pretty gowns, romance, a dash of humor, and some adventure or accomplishment, as well as a touch of personal growth and redemption thrown in for good measure, and I wanted to love it.  But somehow something was missing.  In some respects, it felt a little aimless, as if it lacked a cohesive focus (so maybe the pace felt slow or inconsistent), and Winslet's character's past trauma felt unnecessary (or as if it was an afterthought).  I also didn't totally believe the romance between the two leads, which was a letdown.  As I stated previously, I think they're both very capable actors, so it's not a statement about their abilities; rather, their onscreen chemistry missed the mark, and I was left feeling indifferent about their connection.

Overall, I found it hard to get excited about the film one way or the other.  I suppose it had something to say about healing from past events, second chances, having faith in your own intelligence and abilities (as well as that of others, regardless of gender), and the redemptive power of love, but I may be reading too much into it, as it was hard to ascertain the supposed messages with any great clarity.  And the story lacked the gratifying sparkle and emotional impact that I appreciate in a film.

One of the beautiful things about life is that we each experience something differently, as some people absolutely loved this movie and others gave it only one star.  I thought it was okay, but I doubt I'd ever see it again.",1441411200,3,2256,4.719387755102041
7208801,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"The opening of this movie is text across the screen that says that ""there is a ballroom in the gardens at Versailles.  Of all that follows, that is the only thing that is not fiction.""  Or something close to that.  I loved that!  It sets the tone, saying, let go of any idea that this is a truthful depiction of history and just enjoy the ride.  The negative reviewers apparently missed this.  I expect to enjoy watching this movie over and over.  Every scene is pure artistry.  Works of art.  The settings, the gardens, the costumes, the fabrics, the lighting, the jewels, make-up, hairstyles, wigs, on and on.  And it was done with perfect casting and acting, too.

Oh, and you'll have to agree, that the star of the show is Kate Winslet's bosom LOL.  You'll love in particular, the scene where she's wacking and tearing at vines to clear a garden in a white corset that you're expecting her bosom to explode out of at any moment.  An interesting choice of yardwork garb, to be sure.  In fact, if I remember correctly, the opening scene is of her cleavage.  This never changes.  Kate, you're still lookin' good, girl!

The one and only flaw in this movie, in my opinion, was the one line where Kate Winslet's character says ""He's the most complete person I know.""  I know others have mentioned this line as well.  It's a stupid line.  I really liked and believed in his character and the love between the two, so I disagree with other reviewers who didn't ""buy"" the love affair.  But, the line was dumb.  No question.  It was distracting for about a millisecond.

I intend to let go and enjoy the pure beauty of this movie many, many times.  I hope you can suspend criticism and any need for historical fact, and do the same.  It's a glorious fairy tale, beautifully done.  Just enjoy it.",1441324800,33,1790,4.4953271028037385

This exquisite recreation of France in the 17th century, and the court of Louis XIV, is like going back to gorgeous detail of the costume and manners of the rich. Wait until you see the banquet. The gardener has suffered a terrible tragedy, involving her child, but keeps it secret, telling no one,  and devotes her life to knowing each and every plant and flower. King Louis meets her by accident and assigns her and the landscaper to the construction of the garden at his palace of Versailles.

I'm not an expert but English gardens and houses are pretty easy to spot.  I mean France is what 100 miles south?  Just go to France.  The costumes were gorgeous.",1441065600,,426,4.526315789473684

The backstory for Winslet's character makes perfect sense to me after it is revealed, contrary to what has been stated in other reviews.

7208821,4,B00Y7R9FWQ,"The perfectly perfect Kate Winslet portrays a widow who must make her living in a metier most often practiced by men, that of landscape design.
So naturally, and with little struggle, she's commissioned to add a garden to the palace at Versailles. The plot of this film may be a little thin and probably historians are tearing out their hair over the lack of historical accuracy but, nevertheless, A Little Chaos has great charm and is beautifully filmed. The star performances are evenly low key and several familiar faces seem to have fun in their supporting roles. Alan Rickman, who also directs, may be the calmest Louis XIV ever seen on screen. There ought to be more overt passion, but alas. In any case, I'd recommend A Little Chaos to all. Four stars, for sure, and five stars for the whole look of it, costumes, sets, cinematography.",1440979200,,842,4.73469387755102

7208824,2,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Overall, I was highly disappointed with this film though the soundtrack and visuals are commendable. I am sure that it is a fine product and you may enjoy it, however it was a waste of time in my opinion. Though Alan Rickman marvelously portrayed King Louis XIV, I was not inclined to enjoy the film in the slightest besides minor glimpses at the palace of Versailles and the rural French countryside(though the film was shot entirely in London). Although the scenery and historical setting were beautiful and filmed exquisitely, I found the plot and characters, especially Kate Winslet's performance, to fall flat. There hardly existed budding anticipation or lingering tension between the architect and the gardener, nor did the implied affair even feel emphasised - and when the act was solidified, it was not gratifying but rather nauseating due to the deadpan expression of a disinterested Sabine de Barra whose compliance to the entire thing felt forced and unnatural. At least the immediate cuts to those moments were very choppy and poorly affected the flow of the plot. In actuality, it seemed as though the characters ignored one another and instead of a feigned shyness or exhibiting any bout of moral apprehension for their romantic attachment, they felt lifeless and detached not only from one another but towards their surroundings and the duties of their supposed cherished landscape endeavour. If this was a film about Sabine's passion for gardening, design, architecture and ambition, I want that to be the channel that bring her acclaim, not simply due to a vague elicit affair leading to the pinnacle of this film. In addition, the emerging relationship between Sabine and the King were poorly executed for besides their pleasant conversation in the pear garden and her courageous introduction at court(where many lovely quotable phrases about roses do exist!), there was no semblance of a supposed affair so I do not understand why they would have even hinted at that unless they were going to actually move the plot in that direction. That minor interaction was more intriguing and spirited than any of de Barra's time spent with the gloomy Andr whose attraction is lost on me(not the actor's but the character he played). Ah, I had high expectations and instead of emerging as a triumphant achievement over class barriers, societal expectations and gender normatives during the 17th century, Winslet appeared haggard and though whimsically out of place would be a nice description of her character's oddity and agony, I felt nothing but annoyance at her incompetence.",1440892800,,2589,5.122931442080378

7208835,4,B00Y7R9FWQ,"A period drama set in France during the reign of 'King Louis XIV' during the 17th Century....
'Andre Le Notre' (Matthias Schoenaerts) a landscape-architect has been interviewing in an effort to find
a landscape-designer that will compliment his work at 'The Palace of Versailles'
'Madame Sabine De-Barra' (Kate Winslet) is among the hopefuls presenting their plans for the project, however
the interview with 'Le Norte' does not go well.
When he turns up later at her home offering her the task she is somewhat surprised....it seems her ideas blend
well with his own.
At first 'Sabine' feels out of place among the titled persons she now shares time with, and those closest to 'King
 Louis' (Alan Rickman) however it is something she'll learn to cope with..
'Sabina' whilst working on the project to create a water feature in 'Versailles'  becomes drawn to the charms of
'Andre'
Period Drama's such as this are not to everyone's taste, they are often dowdy, however this does have a very
interesting ad absorbing story-line.
Plus - The film is well presented paying great attention to detail, also having moments of humour along the way,
the film boasts a all-star cast....'Kate Winslet' does excel in period drama's and 'Alan Rickman' is splendid as the
king.
Well worth a viewing.

7208836,1,B00Y7R9FWQ,"A ponderous slog through the mud. Very incohesive - it seemed each main character was acting in his own overwrought movie, and they all sucked. No chemistry between Winslet and what's-his-name; their lovemaking scene was a cold cup of tea and a stale biscuit. And why on earth did they all have British accents? Winslet's character was wholly anachronistic, and her flashback scene preposterous. There were no gardens featured in a movie about Versailles - just a canvas-draped muddy terrace. It looked like the set of a high-school play. At the bitter end we were rewarded with a seashell studded stone wall, which I fervently hoped they would all bash their heads against.",1440720000,4,674,4.9734513274336285

7208874,4,B00Y7R9FWQ,"I'M LOOKING AT THIS SOFT-CARRIAGE MOVIE EVERYDAY AT LUNCH.  I love the actors, the clothes--oh the clothes... and I adore the music, and the people(???)  Everybody in the court of the king has their own rules about sex, morals and other sensibilities.  A wife, a princess, married to the king's brother; she tells her new friend Sabine De Barra, who is visiting the court, who has just lost her husband and child in an accident and died, just moments after her husband tells her clearly he has a mistress, and, that men are allowed to do that when their wives are otherwise preoccupied--the princess is trying to reconcile herself to what she lives and what she is looking at only a few feet away from them: so, she whispers: she is trying to reconcile that her ""royal"" husband is really nice and good to his core but he has a male lover and there is nothing she can do about it.  Everywhere they go the male lover is right there and complains when she tries to get close to her husband.  She is trying to reconcile this troubling thing.  She whipspers that she will stay with him because she thinks she has married a good choice..  He's loving and wonderful to talk to.  And she goes on.  She's actuallly talking to her self and her new girlfriend is listening,  Then the wife said, ""Yes that is his lover.""  In clear view of everyone.  ""I think I understand this.  I want to understand this.  I think I made a good choice.  Yes.  I think I made a good choice.""  She relaxed in her chair.  Her new girl friend just invited to be around the court (she has no bloodline so she can't be royal).  She was invited because the the king himself likes her and finds her company stimulating.  The king has mistresses and lots of kids by them that are not heirs to the throne.  He has a wife, a queen, and kids he loves adoringly.  He's a nice fellow too.  The girlfriend looked over at the royal husband and his lover who are sitting across from each other looking at each other.  The lover has his long legs stretched out playing an instrument.  His long slender fingers touched the strings with finesse.  The music is very pleasant, and beautiful.  Heaven-like.  The girlfriend says nothing and she will say nothing for her life now fits into the 'royal' scheme.  She has been working very hard to get a break like this for her own life.  She is a widow.  Her husband and child are dead.  So.  She is trying to create a new life for herself...and she has just  became the lover, mistress, or concubine of a married royal.  But his wife will never sit still and calmly and quietly while her husband sits across the room with her...though, the wife has spent years sitting across the room from her husband with her tall, thin, lover guy whom she pays for sex.  (Just ""A Little Chaos"")
  The court has about 2,000 members in this community of royal beings and it is understood that they all know each other well in one way or another.  (In defense of their immorality: The king does not allow anyone out and away from the compound without his permission.  Could that account for this kind of royal ""interbreeding"".)
  BUT EVEN SO...this is a quiet lunch movie  that I enjoy.  The plot is delivered so lovely that you find yourself having difficulty realizing that Sabine's lover man has no intentions of marrying her.--margaret opine",1439683200,,3324,4.486622073578595

I am a bit ""IFFY"" about the movie though - that's why only 3 stars. I was disappointed because I really expected more from Alan Rickman as the director. I love him as an actor & I am astonished he has never been recognized IMHO to be worthy of an Oscar. He has played so many diversified roles & always exceptionally done!  I did also expect more from Kate Winslet & my new FAV ""leading"" man, Matthias Schoenaert. Just loved him in ""Far From the Maddening Crowd"". You may have seen him in the ""The Loft"" (smaller roll but he was perfect as a bad boy), for those who would watch that before a period piece (which I adore)! Story subject was good I thought, but kinda left you feeling wanting. Acting - above average actors, but not spectacular performances. Sorry...

It's a beautiful love story, and the message running through the film, that being with the wrong person can make wealth and power count for nothing, but that life with the right person can make even great hardships endurable, really resonated with us.  The cinematography is breathtaking, and the music is delightful.  Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, and Stanley Tucci are superb.  Matthias Schoenaerts seems a bit tentative, perhaps because this is his first film in English, but this does not detract greatly from his performance.  The scene in the garden between the King (pretending briefly to be only a gardener) and Sabine, where they speak of love and loss was both funny and heartbreaking.  By the way, Louis XIV did indeed marry his second wife in secret, and he remained married to her for the rest of his long life.  Everyone involved in the making of this film should be very proud.",1439164800,8,1054,4.721311475409836
7208906,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,This was one of the best period films I have seen in a long time. Kate Winslet was amazing. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a great story.,1439078400,,154,4.0
7208907,4,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Alan Rickman struts his stuff as writer (with Alison Deegan and Jeremy Brock), director , and actor (he plays King Louis XIV) in this love story loosely based on the creation of the gardens of Versailles. There are moments of splendor here separated by overly long moments of tedium that make the film move more slowly that it should. But it is refreshing to see an old fashioned love story presented without potty mouth dialogue and X rated sex  just simplicity and fine acting.

The plot is a romantic drama following Sabine de Barra (Kate Winslet), a talented landscape designer, who is building a garden at Versailles for King Louis XIV (Alan Rickman). Sabine struggles with class barriers as she becomes romantically entangled with the court's renowned landscape artist, Andr&eacute; Le Ntre (Matthias Schoenaerts). There are multiple layers of social comment that are well managed and some simply wonderful small roles for the likes of Stanley Tucci, Jennifer Ehle, Phyllida Law, Pauline Moran, and Helen McCrory.

The musical score by cellist/composer Peter Gregson is colorful and apt for the period, and the cinematography by Ellen Kuras captures interiors well but is flawed on exteriors. In all this is a pleasant visit to Versailles and a tender little love story played with honesty and subtlety. Grady Harp, August 15",1439078400,,1331,5.0963302752293576

Stanley Tucci is terrific as the Duc d'Orleans (the king's brother), stealing every scene he's in; wish we had seen more of him.

But in this movie, his acting was so forced and dry, that you could not relate to the character or feel anything for him. The whole movie feels like a comedy, instead of a drama.

7208935,4,B00Y7R9FWQ,"There is much to like in A LITTLE CHAOS, the story of Sabine de Barra, a talented landscape designer chosen to build one of the primary gardens in Louis XIVs new palace at Versailles.

The performances are first-rate; cinematographer Ellen Kuras images are stunning and there are many individual sequences, particularly the ones between Louis (Alan Rickman) and Madame de Barra (Kate Winslet), that play like magic.  We also enjoyed Stanley Tuccis relatively brief, albeit flamboyant, turn as the kings brother.

Directed by Alan Rickman from a screenplay he wrote with Jeremy Brock and Alison Deegan, A LITTLE CHAOS does an exquisite job of capturing 17th century France.  The plot has many elements, mostly centered on the creation of The Rocaille Grove, the garden designed by the strong-willed and emotionally tortured Madame de Barra.  There are also minor court intrigues, as well as a romance between de Barra and the courts renowned landscape artist, Andre Le Notre (Matthias Schoenaerts), whose spiteful wife (Helen McCrory) is bent on sabotaging the garden project.

The problem with the film is that it lacks focus.  Indeed, all of the wonderful distinct story elements never seem to come together to form a cohesive who le.  This issue becomes most apparent when, near the end of the picture, what was probably meant to be a shocking reveal, falls flat.

Nevertheless, if you get pleasure from romantic costume dramas, you should be able to overlook the faults in A LITTLE CHAOS and admire its many delights.

Universal Home Entertainment has released the film on Blu-ray with Digital HG access.

7208962,3,B00Y7R9FWQ,"I loved Alan Rickman and Kate Winslet in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and was delighted to find that they were in another project together.  Both of them are very talented and almost always do a great job of acting.  SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was absolutely one of my favorite all-time flicks.

This movie was a bit different.  It was watchable and wasn't boring.  The plot was kind of slow moving and a bit forgettable - there was nothing about this story that got me involved with the characters or made me really care what happened.  Defiantly didn't keep me on the edge of my seat or anything.  It isn't my favorite film by a long shot, but I still enjoyed it.  The biggest problem is that the screenplay itself left a lot to be desired.  But everything else was so outstanding that, incredibly, the actual story didn't really matter so much.  It was a pretty good movie simply because of how beautiful it was and how great the acting was.  The soundtrack was nothing special, but appropriate background music for the time and place that this was set in.

It wasn't the best mover ever, but as something beautiful and enjoyable to watch while doing other things, it was really nice.  The cinematography was dazzling and I loved all the scenes of gardens and architecture.  The costumes were lush and the acting was first rate.  I loved Stanley Tucci's performance as the King's brother and Alan Rickman is always first rate as an actor.  I found his portrayal of King Louis XIV to be wonderful!  The leads, Kate Winslet and Matthias Schoenaert were understated as the two lovers, and they were somehow outdone by Rickman and Tucci, even though they had the greater share of screen time.

The plot is FICTIONAL but very loosely based on historical facts.  Louis X!V was a real person, and the construction of Versailles was a real event.  The Queen of France really did die during these events and the King's actual second wife was referred to in a minor and offhand way.  But the factual events contained in this story are merely a backdrop for a fictional love story.  For the plot to interest me, I would have preferred the story to be more factual and less fictional, but that is just me.  Maybe if the love story had been more compelling, I would have gotten more involved, but as it is, the fiction fell flat while the facts are actually quite intriguing.  I think more could have been made of the story.

So, for a mildly enjoyable way to kill some spare time, this is pretty good but it is mostly fluff.  If you are craving some heavy duty stimulating plot to think about, I just don't think you will find it here.",1437782400,,2615,4.534188034188034
7208963,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"I am reviewing the streaming version of A Little Chaos.  I am completely charmed by this love story and by Kate Winslet's character, Sabine de Barra, a gardener who is excellent at putting chaos and whimsy into her beautiful gardens.  I loved the independent, strong-willed nature of Sabine de Barra in this film.  The beauty of the scenery, the costumes, and the period were exceptional in this film.  I loved the portrayal of King Louis XIV by Alan Rickman.  Alan Rickman also excelled in his direction of this film.

Were they forced to ignore real historic information in order to make this entire thing?  Pretty costumes, terrible characters- boring. Why do they like each other anyway? Why does one lady pull down the dress of another and show her breasts to a group of women? then they all giggle??? What was that?  The Rose analogy? OMG how profound! A war is won against sexism!

This was a movie wishing and acting like it has some sort of connection to Versailles- to France- to deep romances- to great stories about loss, about grief, forbidden love, of  love discovered.  The music and costumes tell the viewer there is something to this movie- but it isn't true. It is pretty much a waste of money, and my sweet time. This was a very very very BORING BORING BORING bad film. They should have fed the poor instead of spending it making this crock of ..Don't waste your time.",1437696000,,1148,4.635467980295567

One always enjoys seeing a woman triumph over societal repression and find true love with a worthy amour, especially when the woman is a struggling artist.  Yet, the reserve and quiet of the piece made it impossible to be entirely moved.  Each conflict was so easily overcome by the woman's strength, virtue, talent and beauty - really, she was seemingly flawless - that even the tragedy did not play out in any rewarding way.

Stanley Tucci shines as the outrageous brother to the king.  Matthias Schoenaerts brings Le Norte's character to life in a way that we feel his heart just ticking by until he allows himself to feel again.  Kate Winslet brings the chaos both to those around her and within herself as she works through her grief.  Alan Rickman as king and director worked wonders for this movie.  He kept a calm pace, and gave each character a chance to shine in their own way.  Some will say passion wasn't present between the two leads, however I think it was a more adequate interpretation of how people fall in love.

7208990,4,B00Y7R9FWQ,"It's an interesting and unique story about a woman named Sabine, who has a gift for gardening. Yes, she has a quaint little backyard of flowers and trees, but her real talent is that of a landscape artist. She applies for the opportunity to work in the gardens of Versailles.

After obtaining the position, she is charged by the head architect, Andre (played by Matthias Schoenaerts who was just in Far From the Madding Crowd), to work on a special project that the two eventually design together.  The fact that Sabine was a woman of great talent did not mean that her task was an easy one, but it was eventually successful.

However, underneath Sabine is a woman of great sadness. She is a widow and has also lost her daughter of six years of age. Ther reason for her family's passing isn't revealed until the end of the movie. How it occurs is heartbreaking, so I won't spoil that part in case you decide to watch the movie.

Of course, Andre, who is unhappily married to another woman, who possesses less than a stellar character, falls in love with Sabine. At first she resists because of her sorrow from the past, but eventually discovers solace and comfort in his arms.

Kate Winslet does the movie great charm. Her portrayal of Sabine is nothing but brilliant as all her movies. There is one particular scene that literally brought me to tears where she is among a group of women from the King's court. The ladies sit together and talk about what ladies talk about, but the conversation turns toward whether she is married and has children. Sabine, of course, can barely choke out the truth, and it is then that the majority of the woman in the room relay to her their sorrow of lost children of their own due to smallpox or other tragedies. It is so touching, I could barely keep from crying. Sabine is deeply moved when she realizes that she is not the only woman carrying such a deep burden of grief.

As the movie continues, you are made aware of her gracious character, wisdom, and kindness to others that eventually lead her to a road of healing. Yes, the movie is about the gorgeous gardens of Versailles, but it also much more. The story is rich with sidelines about others who are close to the King as well.

Alan Rickman plays Louis, but he also directs the movie.  As beautifully touching as the story is at times, you may find it a bit slow in movement. There is construction of her portion of the garden, her interaction with the King and his court, her blossoming love for Andre, that all move toward the end at a leisurely pace.  Some may like it -- some may not.  I wanted to push it a bit myself but later scenes redeemed whatever discomfort I felt while waiting for the story to unfold.

You will see many characters played by British actors that you will recognize - Rupert Penry-Jones (Captain Wentworth in Jane Austen's Persuasion); Steven Waddington (who played the Duke of Buckingham in The Tudors);  Adrian Scarborough (who has done his share of British television roles including Midsomer Murders); Stanely Tucci (who has been in plenty of movie roles that you can remember); and many other well-known faces.  What you may find a bit unsettling is the majority of the cast lacking French accents from British and American actors, however, there are a few women who do have one.

Nevertheless, the costumes are quite stunning as well as the scenery and sets. The production was filmed in England at nine locations, including Hampton Court, which I immediately recognized the exterior and interior.

7208993,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"The film opens in 1682 Paris. He is a fictional tale about the building of an outdoor ballroom. Sabine De Barra (Kate Winslet) is an educated gardener/architect whose plans were accepted for the garden. She is independent and always says the right thing at the right time. She is poetic and realistic. It is a romance as she manages to be the most charming woman in France who doesn't own a comb. She never shies away about who she is.

The film was co-written, directed and stars Alan Rickman in what was a cinema delight. Perhaps my biggest criticism is that the complexity of the Sabine De Barra (like Snape) was saved for the end of the feature. The dialogue in the film is poetic speech, filled with imagery and metaphors. Many people might not like this type of production, but for those that do, enjoy.

Then the garden is finished and, without giving too much away about the whole story for those who haven't seen it, everything comes to a conclusion.  It's well-acted.

I'm a big fan of period pieces so when I chanced upon this and saw that it starred my two favorite actors: Kate Winslet and Alan Rickman I didn't hesitate to watch it. Wasn't disappointed at all. Loved every minute of this sometimes quiet film. I did not find it to be slow at all, to me it moved at just the right pace, with the story of Madame de Barra unfolding slowly and deliberately. I will definitely watch it again.",1435968000,22,440,4.25

7209032,1,B00Y7R9FWQ,"It's 17th-century France, and a common woman is hired to renovate the King's palatial gardens in Versailles, while falling in love with the talented man who hired her in the first place. Interested in watching a movie about gardening? Well, what if it stars Kate Winslet, the typically-smoldering Matthias Schoenaerts, and Alan Rickman pulling double-duty as director? A Little Chaos doesn't have to be as dull as it ultimately turns out to be. Period dramas can be passionate and lively and complicated, just look at recent movies like Far from the Madding Crowd (which features Schoenaerts) or  as examples. Unfortunately, this film is about as enjoyable as watching the grass grow.

For a film that's largely about disrupting order and the status quo, A Little Chaos is incredibly reserved and careful. Winslet plays Sabine De Barra, a brilliant landscape artist whose designs challenge the immaculate order preferred by the more-famous architect, Andre Le Notre (Schoenaerts). When King Louis XIV (Rickman) commissions La Notre to design a glorious new garden in Versailles, he interviews De Barra but turns her down, recognizing she'll never fit in the conformist system he prefers. She's too spirited, too chaotic, but despite his reservations La Notre changes his mind and hires her, otherwise there'd be no movie. It isn't long before her free-thinking begins to affect La Notre, as well, and the two slowly become attracted to one another. This despite his manipulative wife (Helen McCrory) mucking things up at every turn, or Sabine's painful past that leaves her cold to the idea of new love.

Passionless and slow-moving, A Little Chaos makes the worst possible use of its stellar cast. Winslet gives a game, even enthusiastic performance as the plucky Sabine, but the character is ultimately bland and uninteresting. Few are better at playing the enigmatic hunk than Schoenaerts, but he struggles under the lame period wig and stiff mannerisms he's forced to take on. This just isn't the right role for him, but then again it's hard to imagine doing anything with the role. Nobody is particularly well-written here, and that goes double for Rickman's King Louis, who flits in and out oddly adds little. Allison Deegan's clunky screenplay is overstuffed with groan-worthy gardening metaphors and double entendres that no actor could make work. Better are the immaculate costumes and the lush production design, but at this point that's become standard for movies like this. The overly-mannered A Little Chaos would have been better served if it were a little more chaotic.",1435968000,9,2584,5.177033492822966
7209033,1,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Like a Lifetime channel poorly-financed romance piece of schlock. About 20 seconds of bad kissing, and 98% horrible music supervision. Just FYI, the photo for the video thumbnail was Photoshopped. That's how little romance there is in this abysmal piece of @&*$#.
P.S. Alan Rickman. I -Fing love you as an actor, but if this is you directing, give it up!",1435881600,3,354,4.819672131147541
7209034,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Superb. Alan Rickman is just stunning. The film is subtle and beautiful, story, acting and visually all work together. The scene of the women discussing their lives is amazing. I have never liked Kate Winslet as much as in this film. She was wonderful. The cast was wonderful and carried the story off well. So pleased to have found this film today! I am going to watch it again soon.",1435881600,52,384,4.5

7209036,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"This was a throughly enjoyable film. In particular the treat of seeing my two favorite actresses, Kate Winslet and Jennifer Ehle, share the screen together for what, to me, were the most powerful and touching moments in the film. Alan Rickman, no surprise, has done an excellent job with this film from all sides.",1435881600,,313,4.814814814814815
7209037,4,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Alan Rickman stars and directs this historical piece on King Louis XIVth and a love story between his chief gardener and his assistant played by Kate Winslet. It is a beautiful movie with many subplots: the inner workings of Versailles and those at court; looking through the world through the eyes of two gardeners and landscape architects; one being a strong willed, talented woman with a strong work ethic; who is a widow and has lost a child; and the Chief Gardener/Landscape Architect caught in a loveless marriage to an older woman who has given him status and title but nothing else. This is a sympathetic portrayal of the King and his household and played quite well by Alan Rickman; a superb actor who carries the movie by his mere presence.",1435795200,100,750,4.732824427480916

8717569,2,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Kate Winslet is such a fine actress you are nearly willing to forgive this lackluster romance. There is zero chemistry with the male lead, and Stanley Tucci does not convince as Louis XIV. Learned a lot about landscaping though!",1533600000,,228,4.871794871794871

8717573,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Very interesting film about the gardens at Versailles. I loved the period details, ""gardening"" at that time frame, and the beautiful acting by everyone. Especially great to see Alan Rickman in an unusual role as an aging Louis XIV, trying to connect unexpectedly with another human outside of his Royal persona. But, best of all, was the quiet and believable romance between the characters played by Kate Winslet and Matthias Schoenaerts - all three are excellent actors.  Highly recommend!",1532822400,,490,5.2025316455696204
8717574,3,B00Y7R9FWQ,"I love historical fiction.  This is much more fiction than history.
The renovation and expansion of the gardens at Versailles was commissioned by Louis XIV when he was 23 years old.  No disrespect to Alan Rickman's acting skills, but there is no way in heaven he's passing for 23.  Or even for 44:  the age Louis XIV was when he moved into Versailles.  Rickman was 69 when this film was made; 'nuff said.  (And, by the way, Andre Le Notre would have been 48 years old when the gardens were commissioned.)
I understand that in historical fiction, conversations and moments are filled in from the writer's imagination in order to breathe life into the facts.  I would assume that if you're going to be fanciful, the result would be more fun.  But in this case, the result is phlegmatic.

The pace and tone of the film is listless.  The acting and cinematography are fine, but the love story and the story of the garden never takes off; the culmination of the film limps across the finish line.  I also wish that there had been a few lines/a scene showing how the hydraulics in the garden actually worked since it was a plot point and was revolutionary at the time.  And, honestly, what is going on with Kate Winslet's hair?  What is the bleached blonde color?  Why is it Always disheveled?  I understand it when she's working in the garden, but when she's going to a social event?  Doesn't this character own a brush?

Bottom line: this was somewhat enjoyable but not worth paying for.",1531958400,,1483,4.556818181818182

8717576,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"Love this movie and  Kate is so natural,  that is why he falls in lover with her. She does not put on airs, she smart and talented.  She see the same in him. Love this movie and may have been Alan Rickman's last",1530835200,,211,3.86046511627907
8717577,5,B00Y7R9FWQ,"We could all use a little chaos in our lives. What made this film poignant was that it was one of the last movies of Alan Rickman's. The storyline about aging and death, especially in the scene with the women of court, and the scene going in to formally meet him and Winslet's speech about the rose was quite special. I've been watching Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts films, and really like his acting. Winslet as always really good, and Rickman who also directed also always excellent, and surprise supporting actors Jennifer Ehle and Rupert Penry-Jones I almost didn't recognize. What is the chaos love brings into our lives? It's a fun period piece, not historical nor hysterical, a romantic drama enjoying the insanities of the insanely rich French Court of Louis XIV. There's great sorrow, machinations, betrayal, water works, mud, and a love of gardening, perfect and chaotic.",1530748800,,886,4.993243243243243
